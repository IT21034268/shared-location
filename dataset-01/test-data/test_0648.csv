2,No multi disc shuffle,"I bought this player to replace my old 5 cd carousel changer. For me it was a bonus feature to have DVD playback. Sony's priority is the DVD playback, not CDs. My favorite function on my old component was the ""all disc shuffle"" function, which was also a button on the component (no TV needed for the display). This one can only shuffle within one disc, but I don't see the point in that. I also don't like where the remote sensor is because I have to leave the door open to my entertainment center to use the remote. This defeats the purpose of a closed door that keeps little hands away from the equipment and media."
3,Smooth but slow,"I bought this unit to replace a similar Toshiba multi-disc DVD changer. It is much better than the other multi-disc changers I have owned, mainly because the disc loader and changer tray is a much sturdier mechanism. This was a big problem with my older Toshiba unit. The picture is very good, particularly if you use HDMI switching through a HDMI-switching enabled H/T Receiver.I took away two stars because this unit has one fundamental shortcoming - it is slow to start up - the first time I fired it up, I actually thought there was a problem with the unit.One other noteworthy point is that it is only 1080i compatible and doesn't work up to 1080p. Of course, most of us can't even tell the difference!That aside, good unit - particularly at the amazing price!"
3,Backstage Fun,"This toy was purchased for my granddaughters to share. They love it and they have already played with it for several hours. It has lots of little pieces and stickers, so it is definitely not for a younger child. We have already misplaced several items from the set. but that doesn't seem to bother the girls...they love playing make believe with their Hannah Montana dolls and this backstage set."
2,one giant math problem,It gives you a general ideal of how to open one but your better off using google cause all this book tells you is you gotta try a zillion times to open it.
4,A woman scorned...,"""Hoodwinked"" by Quentin Carter was off the chains! The book had me hooked from the first page. It is the story of Keith his brother Kevin, Tukey, Keith's baby mama/girl/partna in crime and Selina, Keith's thang on the side. Keith and Kevin are 2 hustlers, Keith is all about flossin' and Kevin's about business. Keith cheats on Tukey all the time, mainly with Selina who is really setting him up to be taken down, by one of Keith's so called boys.But after Tukey lands in jail for taking that wrap for Keith's $300,000 she's got revenge on her mind, cause while she's locked down, Keith ain't thinkin about her, he's with Selina.Tukey also suspects Keith in the murder of her Uncle Ben, who was Keith's supplier. This story has it all murder, kinky sex, and most of all revenge. Tukey proves she's not the one to be played with!!!"
2,"so, so","I like that we got to see the first couple of pages, and some of the pitcures, or just a couple, but when i got the book, to use for inspiration for my photo class, it was very disappointing that all the pictures were not like the couple they show, i love viggo, but this was not one of his better works. sorry"
5,wow,"It was really easy to install. It took a max of ten minutes from start to finish and it is working great. The flap closes quickly and seals better than expected. The only down size it is very, very small, I thought it would be a little bigger. Would recomend measuring your animal prior to ordering."
5,Great Value and Price,This black knife pouch complimented the knife I purchased as well for my son. I'm very pleased with the quality and my son uses it all the time while at his scout meetings .
4,great service,great delivery but wish the dish was a little prettier. It fits butter more than well but looks a little cluncky. The price is high but I guess that is the quality.
5,Cheap and fast,It works an I got the ink a lot quicker than I expected. What more would you want for less than half the price??
1,worked for a day,This ink worked the first day and then it would not work anymore. Not the best way to spend $5.00 but I thought it would be worth a shot seeing if the cheaper product works. I guess sometimes it is better to spend more to get a product that works.
4,Refilled InK cartridge,The ink cartridge is professionally filled/refurbished and packaged well. The print quality was indistinguishable from that of a new one. It is being used for a month now and no degradations has happened.
3,Interesting Concept,"I'm a hard grader, the book is worth reading. There is a lot of originality in the book and the story keeps moving. The prison breakout would probably not meet the realism test from a 20 year Bureau of Prisons guard but it was a fun read. A good cast of characters. Just one comment. The author's photo with a shaved head and goatee makes him look like the guy at the end of the bar telling SEAL war stories who doesn't know what BUDS stands for. He's just trying too hard to look tough. He also doesn't know beans about the military although he pretends to. He has one of the characters getting his Masters at the Naval Academy (no the academy doesn't have a grad school, the navy grad school is in Monterey CA and has nothing to do with the USNA). Also at the prison he has Bradley Fighting Vehicles with 50mm guns. No, Bradleys have 50 calibre machine guns but the US doesn't make a 50 mm cannon. Does the rough tough author know what GOOGLE is?"
4,I like it,"If you're a fan of Sark, it's another book by Sark. And I like it. It's a good book. At some point in my life, I'm sure I'd have absolutely loved it. It's playful, quirky, and vulnerable, or honest. Maybe I will come to a place again from which I will absolutely love it (I've been experimenting with a heavier outlook on life for the past few years...though I coulda fooled some peeps on that one.)"
5,NEVER BEAT THIS PRICE AGAIN,"WHAT A STEAL.. I DOUBT YOU CAN FIND IT FOR WHAT I BOUGHT IT FOR AGAIN, I BOUGHT 5... EXCELLENT PRODUCT"
5,Fujifilm memory chips,The unit arrived at the delivery date well before I did and performs to my full expectations. Well done.
4,Suprise for the mind,"This book is fantastic. Its takes you through a journey of a black womans life. Most black men can not understand why black women are so strong. In reading this book, I realized that struggle can make you or break you, and in this case, it made a strong black woman. Thank you for the experience, and thank you for opening my eyes."
4,Awesome!,"I truly enjoyed reading this book. I read it in one day because it was so very hard to put down. The author writes from her heart and soul. She includes some very personal information in her writing that hit home with me.I loved the fact that she put pictures in her book, which made the book more enjoyable.I look forward to the author's next book.Truly a remarkable writer, as well as, a remarkable person."
1,Waste of money,I was really looking forward to using this pan--the size and shape are nice. But it heats food unevenly and after only a few uses the non-stick surface is peeling off even with washing by hand and using plastic spatulas. It was a real waste of money.
3,Gift,"My mom got it for my dad. He seemed to like it, but they had to switch vehicles and he can no longer use it."
5,Amelia Bedelia books are wonderful,"Amelia Bedelia Goes Camping is another wonderful, funny, engaging book for young readers. If your young one has read one then all of Amelia's books will be on their wish list! I highly recommend all of the Amelia Bedelia books."
3,Give one a try,"Amelia takes everything literally. So when you tell her to ""hit the road"", she picks up a stick and hits the road with it. That's the gag throughout the whole book and the whole series. For a very young reader that's a pretty good gag. But I don't know about a whole series, and I don't know about rereadability.So, what I've done is pick up an Amelia Bedelia to have on the shelf. If it really appeals to any of our little readers, great. There are lots more where this came from. If not, this is a perfectly fine and fun addition."
5,Excellent insight on This Topic,"I found this book to be extremely knowledgeable and written from the heart. For those who need this type of guidance, the advice given is written with a personal touch and is truthful and precise."
2,Read the Real Cases Instead,"As a professor of Criminal Law and Judicial Procedure, I picked this up out of interest into the mindset of Justice Scalia. It doesn't help. Nor do I recommend it as reading for the common Joe, undergraduate student, or others with a budding interest in legal issues.The reader would be just as well off using LexisNexis, FindLaw, or some other site to read briefs of the Supreme Court's decisions, or for those more academically inclined, to read the actual case decisions themselves."
2,Meh.,"Without being long winded:First telescope.Easy to use and assemble.A bit disappointing, even though it is cheap."
4,Australian SF Reader,"Angelo Agnelli wants Murray to set up a sacrifical political campaign, so he can gauge the current politics of the place to help work on his own re-election campaign.Murray goes to an old trucker friend for help with this, but soon gets caught up in some reasonably scary associated violence."
2,There will be better books than this I expect,"I've bought this book because I was taking the exams on September, 2009. When I read the book I got the idea that the exams were focused on the main aspects on Linux and aren't ""tricky questions"", you understand me.What an error.What is the process number of init??Many questions are of this kind, and you can imagine my deseperation when taking the exam. If you are planning to take LPIC exams, bear in mind that, besides you have Linux experience, you need to know such things in order to keep up with the questions of the exams. For instance, I am SuSE user, and the questions of debian package management were... How to say?? They question aspects of parameters of dpkg the very used to use know."
5,THE linux reference to have for beginers to intermediates,"This book is a 10 compared to other linux books I've read.I have Running Linux at home, the book looks bland next to this one.Network+ All in One certification was the best IT book I had ever read, now I put this one right next to it.The book explains all the linux commands you'll need to know to do basic administration and offers on average 4 examples of each command with various keys and the output.Everyone with little Linux experience should have this book, it's a wealth of command information and how Linux works.My only ""bummer""? I wish they were more exercises at the end of each chapter, but then again, just type in the examples on a Linux box and you'll get just as much practice!.I'm going for my Linux+ and LPI (101/102) certifications, I'm sure this book will help me reach my goals.Blashy, A+, i-Net+, Network+"
4,Great art! Good stories.,"If you like the droids in the movies, you'll like these comics! (I'm a Star Wars fan so I might be partial.) As a Dad to 2 boys, 5 and 9, I read alot of comics. These are not beyond my boys' comprehension, and the kids love Artoo and Threepio!"
1,Tracey Ullman,Umm...yeah...not what I was expecting. I usually hit pause when I go to the restroom...not this time! Just let it play! Wasn't much to miss. I've seen her do so much better. Sorry Tracey.
2,Bad,"I don't understand what readers see in any of Cozzens' books. Who in the world would think these things are well written? Just because his research is detailed (thus the two stars) doesn't make the book good. His dry-as-dust descriptions of unit movements read like a laundary list. A reviewer wrote of another of his books ""Cozzens does it again"". Well, that review will itself keep me from reading that book. Unfortunately, so little has been written about Stones River that anyone interested in the war in Tennessee can not avoid this thing."
5,***Exquisite***,I ADORE this book. It is an absolute favorite and after reading it I was inspired to read everything Ms. Vaz has written. What a marvelous teller of tales she is!!!
4,very inlighting on the true state of sports,"One more great book for Mr. Mike Lupica, the one great thing I remember about this book was how it truely states the truth about how sports is working the wallet over very well from each, and every true sports fan in America. Maybe these players need to all go get real job's, and no what it feels like to worry about paying the price of liveing in the real life world."
2,Doesn't get to the point.,"My opinion: Reused contemporary ideas about one aspect of good conversation. The author fills his book with far too many examples, and the examples that are given are summarized in points that are almost common-sensical. Supposedly a psychological book focusing on the author's years of research on the subject, but its apparent lack of APA citations downplay that notion. Wishy-washy."
1,Worth buying only if you want everything Gram ever did,I was disappointed. Obviously these recordings were not finished work. I'm sure that with good production the recording would have been excellent.
3,Tries to straddle the fence but not successful at doing so.,"I got my copy from a U.K. source several months ago and was surprised at the writing quality. Ms. Seward has written for Majesty Magazine for years and I can understand the need to not offend the Royal family but this book doesn't do much of anything well. With her connections Ms. Seward is bound to have learned a lot of things ( that's the only reason I give it a three)but her book runs from praise to assault to smear on just about everyone, even the Queen. It seems to me that she couldn't make up her mind what she wanted to do with facts and innuendo, if I were royal I would rather not have her around."
1,Tabloid Trash,"Seward should be ashamed of herself for this enormously biased gossip rag. It's quite easy to trash the Princess now... after all, the dead have a much more difficult time defending themselves."
1,Gallery Prospectus,"This is the 7 page gallery prospectus - not the color catalog. It has no images other than the cover and consists of an exhibition intro, a list of works in the exhibition plus bio. If it had a couple of plates of her work it would be an interesting piece of ethemera, however, without art or poems it's not worth buying unless you're a Patti completionist."
5,TOP but not made for this car,"The quality of this console is great. However, it is NOT a direct bolt on part. It requires sunstantial work to make it fit and look right."
3,a bit dated and too much cut and paste from exchange info,a sprinkling of good info intermixed w/ dated info and cut and paste from the exchange concerning contract descriptions.I don't think it was worth this much money. a lower price - it'd be worth that.
1,I don't think anybody should call it music!,I'm an old man who likes jazz but I don't think this sounds like those jazzy people that stupid man was talking about. You've probably heard of gay 90's well the 90's are gay and so is the music we have to listen to during this messed up decade!(And the album isn't good either!)
5,damn,"hell yeah i love this cd. anyone who likes punk or rock or rockabilly should get this cd. i didnt even listen to it till 4 months after i got it though. yeah that was bad, but it blew me away once i got around to hearin it. now its still constantly on my cd player. i mean come on, ""growin up"" is one of the best songs ive heard. scott owen and that upright bass just rock the hell out of everybody else."
5,TLE ROX,"Do you want a band that plays music that is catchy, can get stuck in your head, and still not be annoying? You've come to the right place. I dare anyone to listen to this cd for just a few days (or maybe just a few minutes) and not start singing along."
5,The Living End?You Havent Lived Till You've Heard This Album,"With the american ""Warped Tour"" done and 4 Australian singles released this up-and-coming rockabily-punk band is going to be big!!! This is their 3rd album and is great. I bought my copy of the CD 5 months ago and still listen to it everyday."
5,Great reading at a great price,"This book represents great value. You get stories - usually book excerpts - from people like Whitehouse, Bert Hall, Rickenbacker, Saint-Exupery, Brickhill, Gabreski, Blesse, Engen, Douhet, Billy Mitchell, both of the editors, and quite a few others, 28 in all. All of the major aerial conflicts from WW I onward, through 1999, including the Middle Eastern and Gulf wars, are represented. There is a comprehensive index as well. While one might have wanted a few photographs to go with the text, at this price, who can complain?"
2,"I vastly prefer ""The Quick and the Dead""","After reading Williams' Pulitzer-finalist novel, this collection didn't really do anything for me. The brilliant parts and pieces are much the same in ""Honored Guest,"" but for me they never gelled into a story I cared about. I think Joy Williams is one of the most interesting writers out there. ""The Quick and the Dead"" changed the way I think about books. The challenge with ""Honored Guest"" is not letting it change the way I think about Joy Williams."
2,"GOOD,BAD &THE UGLY",NO OFFENSE TO ANYONE ( LADYS ) BUT I'M JUST NOT TO FOND OF FEMALE VOCALS IN MOST ROCK SITUATIONS.THE MUSIC IS VERY GOOD THOUGH.WHEN THE FEMALE ISN'T VOCALIZING ITS PRETTY DARN GOOD.DON'T MEAN TO RUFFLE ANY FEATHERS.PEACE & ROCK ON....
5,A wonderful product.,"Before buying my set of pasta bowls, I read the reviews on them. They were all good but one person said they did not stack well. Before I received my bowls I was trying to figure out where to store them. When I received them I was very happy with the quality, the feel of them and the look of them are wonderful and they stacked together beautifully. I am so pleased I bought them, I am going to buy another set so I have eight all together."
4,Ikarus - 'Touch The Sun' (Earthone),"Band's first [of three] CD releases. Best described as part electronic - part new age. Asthe there appears to be at least one more artist out there with the same name - be sure you have the right one. Tunes that did it for me were the opening title track ""Touch The Sun"", the almost Gary Numan-like ""Shine On"", the awesome ""Another World"", the truly inventive-sounding ""Bassment"", ""In My Deepest Dreams"" and ""Paramatama"". Personnel here looks to be a duo - Wolfgang Stindl - keyboards, didgeridoo & piano and Harald Paints - keyboards, programming & mixing. Fans of Delerium, Bill Lebb and Front Line Assembly should get the most out of this CD."
2,Audience Tape Beware,"This is from an audience tape and the sound is poor.It's a shame because this was a great show if the recordingwould have been a sound board recording. Robert Calvert was agreat talent but this is only for collectors who want everythinghe ever did, and I do have everything. So be advised if you canput up with the audience chatter throughout there are some goodsongs here but I can't believe this would be released if he were alive."
2,Platter too small and flimsy,This platter is only large enough to hold a very small steak or a sandwich. It also very thin and light (read flimsy). I do not recommend it.
2,"not again, Ian Wilson","I recently read Ian Wilson's second shroud book, which came out shortly before the carbon dating was performed. In that book, he evenhandedly stressed that a medieval dating would refute the authenticity of the shroud and confirm the direct documentary evidence that suggests a medieval origin. The other evidence he presented then was interesting and imaginative but much seemed subjective and all seemed inconclusive. Now we have a dating (medieval, to be sure) and he discusses more well presented, interesting and similarly inconclusive evidence. Why hasn't Ian Wilson let his earlier precondition for authenticity stand?"
1,Why bother?,"Ian Wilson has continued to ignore the real evidence because it does not support his prefered outcome. What is the point of producing yet another book that is nothing more than an expression of the authors longstanding leap of faith regarding a medieval piece of cloth. Why does Mr Wilson feel the need to have an image of his prefered deity, when there is so much data to say that it can not be?"
5,Very convincing evidence,"Ian Wilson's work is an even-handed, scholarly treatment of the Shroud of Turin debate. While clearly a 'true-believer', Wilson treats his skeptics and critics with the utmost respect... even those whose sinister ulterior motives can scarcely be denied. The evidence offered in this book is compelling and thought-provoking. The now infamous 1988 Carbon-14 dating is laid bare for what it was: a poorly orchestrated effort on potentially contaminated samples of the Shroud which were snipped from an ill-conceived location. In short, Wilson's work is at the very least, a masterful summary of the current state of research on the most famous religious relic in the world."
1,Not as good as the first.,"This book was not as well-written or as useful as the first. I consider it to have been a waste of money because there was little in the way of practical advice.Compared to the original, with its no-nonsense prose, clearly-organized chapters, sprinkled with philosophy, this book was a rambling diatribe that went nowhere. It did have some good tips for the EXPERIENCED diver who wants to make money faster by diving behind electronics stores, etc. but if you are not sure whether diving is your cup of tea, I would buy the first book and try those tips first."
2,Wrong size,The sizing chart was compeltely usless and incurrate. The costume was a total waste of money! If you don't have any other alternative by at least one size smaller than normally needed.
3,"Good products, but very easy to get dirty and hard to clean.",Water will leave spots on it and very hard to remove the spots. Probably B+W filters will be better.
4,"Excellent, but!","This is a replacement for one - same make and everything - that lost its coating in a couple of places. I suspect that the coating was missing from day one and because I didn't use my camera, I didn't notice it. No problem, Amazon are sending me a refund for the first, faulty one. I was going to change brands for a replacement but can't find anything that appears to have the quality of Hoya filters. Actually that's not quite true - some filters have been given really good write ups but I've never heard of their manufacturer, so I stuck with one I know about.I could have bought something much cheaper but why put a cheapo filter on a really good lens. Hoya filters are well made and I've never struggled to remove one from the lens either. It's metal as well, so won't warp."
4,Lens cap doesn't fit very well,"Why is it that you invest so much in a nice UV/Haze filter for your expensive lens, and these things don't even come with their own lens caps that fit snug on the filter ring? The Canon lens cap doesn't fit on this filter very well.The filter itself is great. I really can tell the difference, but man, that lens cap issue is ruining it!"
1,Don't buy this disc if you buy NG National Park Maps,"The manufacturer should have shown that this disc is included in NG National Park Maps. I bought both, and could not know this until I openned and installed them - what a waste! I bought this through J&R and they refused to help me with this. Very disappointed."
3,Nice appearance but POOR QUALITY!!,"THE PRICE IS GREAT--WHICH PROVES YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR!! CHAIRS ARRIVE UNASSEMBLED, BUT ASSEMBLY IS FAIRLY EASY, EXCEPT WHEN THE PARTS DON'T FIT TOGETHER WELL. I ASSEMBLED FIRST TWO CHAIRS WITH NO PROBLEM BUT THE SECOND TWO CHAIRS ARE RICKETY AND JOINTS WON'T TIGHTEN. NOW I'M TRYING TO FIND HARDWARE TO BRACE THEM ADEQUATELY FOR USE, RATHER THAN GOING THROUGH HASSLE OF RETURNING THEM. THE FABRIC QUALITY & PATTERN ARE JUST OK, NAILHEAD TRIM IS VERY NICE DETAIL; HOWEVER, WORKSMANSHIP IS POOR i.e. LOOSE/UNRAVELING THREADS, RANDOM AREAS ON CHAIR FRAME NOT COVERED BY FABRIC, ILL-FITTING CHAIR SKIRT. BUYER BEWARE!"
3,BLAH!,"As far as the animation and character design goes, it is Absolutely fantastic in every way, but the plot and characters are bland, ditzey, annoying and just plain forgetable, the dubbing is very mediocre and the recuring gags get old real fast. Meaning funny the first tim, but after a while it you heard it before and becomes predictable and you know whats going to happen BLAH, BLAH, BLAH, BLAH! But those of you who are into mindless fanservice with no moral entertainment whatsoever, then this anime is for you, but personally I don't reccomend it to all Otaku's everywhere."
5,I can eat 10 worms easy,"It's funny. The bet cracked me up. That is a little gross. But it's also very funny. Kids will enjoy it, but don't take your younger kids."
4,Amusing for Kids,"This is definitely one for the kids. They'll love the childish humor played out in a movie about eating worms. It's gross, but it's also a bunch of boys so it's perfectly understandable. That's what it was made for anyway. If you're looking for a good family film, then you might try this one. It's not the best, but your kids will get a kick out of all the sliminess and silliness."
5,old faithful,I purchased these for my husband to replace an identical pair that finally wore out. He had received them used and put them to work for a while before one of the fingers on each hand wore through. Carhartt has maintained their reputation for quality and durability with these gloves.
1,A dish of CRAPOLA... with maggots on the side,"The film quality, material, and editing are all abysmal... not a real 'shock' tape, even if it was made forty years ago. Ugly girls boxing is too 'hot' for cable?! Completely amateurish + barely comprehensive. Stay away."
1,Yuck. Zero workout value!,"I don't know what video the other folks whose reviews appear here were watching, but it couldn't have been this one. Denise Austin may have other very fine videos (and certainly has a following) but this one is a real turkey. Part of the reason may be the video's age - it's very 80s - but I just don't see how it is a ""fat burning"" workout. I couldn't break a sweat doing this tape before I was in shape, let alone now. The music is sleep-inducing elevator style and while Denise is a very helpful instructor, the moves are just...well you won't look cool doing them, let's leave it at that. Okay for a very very beginner I guess but useless to the experienced aerobicizer."
3,So close....,"This book is beautifully written. After finding out about my own congenital heart 'irregularity' I was very interested in the topic. I was engrossed in the story and descriptions about his Father, his siblings, and his own confrontation with his heart 'problems'. I read the book in a day and about 2/3 of the way through I became disappointed. The story shifts from his personal landscape to the 'heart history' he researched in London and to the medical procedure he witnesses. I kept reading, hoping he would deliver the emotional lessons he learned about his own heart or about himself or about his relationship with his Father. But he did not. In the end his beautiful words eclipsed the meaning."
1,feel it was a waste of money,"I feel this was a waste of my hard earned money. I expe ted this book to be full of photos of the Effenbee dolls produced by the company from 1949 to present, as well as descriptions, prices they sold for at the time of production. VERY disapointed in this item, shows more like a very small photo on which seems to be acopy of a store flyer. not worth the money at tall."
4,Good pocket guide...,"Not only does the size of the book lend itself to being on the trail (easily stuffs into a camelpack or daypack), but it does a good job of explaining some basic repairs or problems you may encounter during a ride. Such things covered include: brake pads rubbing against the rim, unable to unclip from your pedal, a jammed chain, loose hub, or simply not having tire levers. A description is given of the problem, how to diagnose the problem, and what steps you can take to repair it yourself (or at least get back to the trialhead).This book also provides diagrams, labeling components. This is beneficial to new riders who may not be certain of what is a cog, derailleur, or hub for instance.While there may be other, more detailed repair books out there, this is a great book that you can easily take with you as you are first learning how to fix some common problems yourself. Definitely a good pocket guide."
3,Endymion Spring,"It starts out as a great read, then falls flat....so disappointing! I was expecting it to be a great book like ""Inkheart"", but alas, it was not. ""Chasing Vermeer"" is better as is ""The Wright 3"".Endymion Spring Had the ability to be a GREAT book....the editing of the story failed....quite sad actually...."
2,F-,"This is my review of Endymion Spring by Matthew Skelton.I give the book an F-. I didn't like it at all, and it was very boring most of the time. The author does a poor job of making the story interesting. The characters all act alike and speak alike. You can't even tell them apart most of the time. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone else.Emma, 7th grade"
3,"Dull beginning, flat characters, it should have been better!","I believed the hype about this being the middle school answer to the DaVinci code. Wrong! The DaVinci code is a fast paced adventure. this book was slow and ponderous, painful to the 11,12 and 13 year old boys in this book club! Even I felt the beginning was very slow and it only started to pick up around page 70. By the end, I was enjoying myself but if I didn't need to read it to run this book club I would have put it down much earlier.There is a great story in there. I read many a beautiful and descriptive phrase, even marked them because of the beautiful writing. However, there is something missing and it didn't click with this group of boys at all.I'd skip it."
2,Tom Tom Update Map,"Ordered this to update my TomTom 700 which was trying to get me to drive off the side of freeway overpasses that had been built after the original on-board maps had been installed. I followed the instructions on how to delete the old and install the new maps, but once I deleted the original map, the Tom Tom could no longer be recognized by the computer and is now an expensive paperweight. This update program is what it is holding down since they are now both worthless."
2,Gave up after one recipe,"This looked like a good deal as a used book. However, I tried the Goulash soup and it wasn't any good. So I ditched it."
2,Expected more,"Looked forward to reading this ""definitive"" biography with great anticipation only to be disappointed. Quotes and characters are sometimes inaccurate and most of the ""great"" films were glossed over. Given the fact the most of the players in Groucho's life are dead, interviews would be impossible; but the author seem to write only what he had to and no more. However, the family history prior to their fame was interesting and for the most part fully realized."
4,Comedians and Sadness,"It's a cliche, but like many cliches it has some truth to it. Comedians can be depressed, unhappy people--that's why they turn to comedy in the first place, because they see the incongruities of life and are trying to cheer themselves up. Kanfer nails Grocho Marx's life is this readable biography. It comes as no surprise that Groucho alienated his family and friends because of his abrasive temprament. What Kanfer analyzes really quite well is the cult of personality than began to surround Marx in the '60's. Hippies and protestors began to see him as a sort of funky godfather to their contempt for America. Kanfer lets us see what a master of comedy he was; but also lets us see the destructive results when a man can't put aside his mask and just be a human being. As the critic Terrence Rafferty said in reviewing this book: ""I love 'Duck Soup' but I take it out of the VCR every once in a while."""
2,"Skimpy, derivative and remote","Kanfer seems to have read everything ever published on the Marx Bros., but evidently didn't talk to anyone who knew them. He relates the facts of Groucho's life succinctly and, I assume mostly accurately -- but there's absolutely no sense of getting into his subject's head. The book observes Groucho from a distance, talking about his character traits without ever exploring them. It's interesting enough to make you want to seek out other books on the subject, and does cover the events AFTER Groucho's death in some detail. If this were the only book on the subject, it would be adequate -- but it isn't. There are much better books out there."
2,WARNING! WARNING! Chick Lit....,"This book's premise is great, and I thoroughly enjoyed the first 75 pages. We meet the two main characters and learn interesting things about their lives. Arlette is the 'book doctor,' and the query letters that are interspersed with the action are very entertaining. I loved reading about this side of publishing...Then I hit the wall. Too much discussion in the text about feelings, nothing more than feelings...I started skimming. The dialogue started disappearing. The query letters sent to Arlette all started sounding the same, as though the author had lost her ability to change voice.I gave up at page 130, regretfully. I stopped caring about the characters, but I wanted to like the book more and couldn't."
2,Not as described,"The book was sold ""Like New."" I have purchased better used books from the school store. There was highlighting, marks and a crease in both covers that was not listed in the description. Should have been rated as USED and sold as such."
4,Very good product!,"This product is really well designed and made. It works fine, with no problems at all. The only thing they should include is a short explanation why are two cables included, and how to use them correctly. I had to search for the info elsewhere."
1,Clairol Natural Instincts medium brown,"OMG. Color product was OK. But Color Enhancer turned my hair BRIGHT RED/COPPER color. What the heck? Do NOT USE THE COLOR ENHANCER. Dreadful. Oh and if you call the ""color experts"" at Claurol's 800 number...guess what. The ""extension"" is no longer available. I can only suppose Clairol does NO product testing whatsoever. I will be forced, after simply wanting to touch up my roots...to go for full professional color correction. I am furious."
3,Hot enough to kill.,An easy read but too Americanised for my liking. The mother daughter relationship is not very believable and the romantic element lacks imagination.Hot Enough to Kill (Jolene Jackson Mystery Series) (Jolene Jackson Mysteries)
3,Okay but not great,It was very slow paced and some of the situations were simply too far fetched to be believed. I probably wouldn't recommend this book to anyone.
4,hot enough to kill was a good book.,i like good mysteries and this was good.it was one of the first ones i read.i would recommend it to every one who likes a good story...
2,Meh,"Sadly, the glasses don't seal around the eyes very well causing them not to be that helpful. More of a pain to keep pushing them up while trying to cut an onion."
3,"RSVP and Amazon, you should be ashamed!","Fun product, but the postage and handling fee: ROBBERY! Our daughter bought these goggles for her dad, as both a fun and a practical gift. On both counts, she succeeded. The goggles not only kept him from tearing up as he chopped onions for our Thanksgiving stuffing, but also were a fun conversation piece. When he's not wearing the goggles, we'll have the photos to make us chuckle. HOWEVER, in her haste to buy the goggles, she didn't notice that the postage and handling fees totaled just two dollars under the cost of the extremely lightweight goggles in their small box! ($19.95 for the goggles and $17.98 for the postage and handling)RSVP International Onion Goggles, BlackWe've come to expect much better from you, Amazon!"
1,Amazon SPAM,"Constantly receive SPAM regarding products I have never purchased. If you use Amazon, be sure to use a yahoo email you can delete afterwards !"
4,Don't laugh! They work!,"I've heard some people scoff at the idea of wearing ""onion glasses"", but my wife and I each have a pair in the kitchen and they work great for us: no tears, no itchy, red eyes and ""I can't see!"" anymore. I downgrade them by just one star because they could be a little tighter on the face, seeing as how the foam rims are supposed to seal out all fumes. They keep about 90% of them out, though. But all the other old tricks to keep from crying when cutting onions, such as lighting a candle nearby or holding your onions underwater or outdoors--either they don't work for us or are inconvenient. I vote for the onion goggles!"
1,Way too small!,I ordered these for Christmas for my husband but when I tried them on they were much too small and they fit very poorly on the face. I was really disappointed and I am returning them. I thought that they would fit snugly against the face at the bottom and the top but they did not. I really wanted them to work. For you they may but not for us.
2,"Okay, first of all I have a big head...","These glasses are way too small for me. I can't even fit them on my face. I have been told that I have a somewhat large cranium, but I've never had to deal with something this bad.I honestly think they sent me a kids pair.I got this as a gift for my wife and it should fit her. I just wanted to warn you guys about how big these are because I know I'm not the only one with a large head.As far as whether or not they stop you from crying when cutting an onion... I have no idea. From what I've read it works and I'll try to do a followup and let you know if my wife likes them or not."
5,They work!,I used to cry like crazy every time I cut an onion. And I was really skeptical about these. I've been using these for about a month now and I haven't cried since!
1,too narrow for my face,"These are worthless. Too narrow to fit my face. It's not flexible and does not conform to your shape of face. You really are better off buying a cheap pair of swimming googles or ski googles, I wish I had."
5,less tears more onions,"Most everyone gets a chuckle when they see me gear up to cut an onion. But I get the last laugh. As everyone is forced to leave the chopping area with burning, watering eyes; I am happily chopping away with not so much as a blink or a wink to fend off obnoxious onion particles. These light weight plastic glasses are fitted perfectly to my face. The soft foam gasket never feels uncomfortable or too tight. While I wouldn't wear them out in public, I don't mind how they look. The kitchen gadget guru will want one of these. Amuse your friends and chop an onion in peace. What more could you ask for?"
5,Saved my mascara,"I hate cutting onions because I am hyper sensitive to them and end up bawling uncontrollably for hours after I'm done. My husband bought me these to help with the crying. I was skeptical at first, but they actually work! I can still smell the onions, but I don't tear up and cry forever while I'm chopping them. They do look a little dorky on, but they totally work, so I'm not going to complain"
5,Ooh La La Crib Set,"The bedding is beautiful! The quality is exceptional. We decorated my Granddaughter'a whole room with the wall paper border, wall hangings, mobile, etc. from this collection."
1,"Horrible, with a capital H.",I purchased this software because no encyclopedia came with my Dell Desktop. Well I wish I hadn't!!! This software moves entirely too slow. I thought it was just my inexpensive computer which still happens to be windows xp running on a pentium 4 processor. Thanks to the other one star reviewers I realize it's not my computer the software just stinks. I now own a Ibook and enjoy using the Mackiev's Worldbook encyclopedia that came with it. But I have the feeling that the Encyclopedia Britanica has far more articles. But I would never know it takes several minutes to boot up the information and sometimes (most of the times) it just gets stuck. What a waste.
1,Arrived with a problem but customer service was excellent,"My net arrived with a problem, but Long Road's customer service immediately responded to my concerns. Because I did not hang up the net until the mosquitos were out and about, I was unaware of the problem during the warranty period. Nonetheless, Long Road still got back to me and even refunded the cost of the net."
5,Awesome,"I love this thing. I took this with me before i deployed. Its small, fits into my ruck, the travel bag helps keep it clean, so it doesnt get dirty. It was also great for the really long (26 hour) flight from the states to where I was headed. Its great, I would recommend this to anyone traveling. Great product, sturdy design, if its not firm enough you can buy buck wheat to stuff in it and there you go brand new."
2,Too small for comfort,"I bought into the promise of comfort and I liked the whole organic premise but what I realized on my first use of this pillow on a flight from Boston to San Francisco is that it is way too small and tight around the neck. I am not a big guy and I don't have a thick neck but this pillow is just too small to fit around my neck and I think any other guy for that matter. Unless you are a kid or a lady, then I would say a man needs to try it on before buying. I feel it's very uncomfortable. Also it is rigid so depending on your preference - if you want your pillow to be soft and your head to sink into it this is not the pillow for you."
1,Disappointed,Brought this pillow for a long flight because it received very good reviews. The pillow feels good but it is just too small. And it fits tight around the neck. I sent it back.
2,Design problem.,"The pillow is uncomfortable because it pushes your neck forward. Too much bulk behind the neck. I considered emptying out some of the filler so I could shake it down into the sides and leave the neck area flatter. I think that might work but I was afraid to mess with it in case it didn't work, and then I couldn't return it. I ended up returning it."
1,Not worth the time or money,We thought this would be a great combo but the food processor only lasted one block of cheese before it broke. The blender has served me well in previous years but the combo unit is not worth the money. I sent it back within a week of delivery. You can get a better blender for the money too. Combo units and movie sequel just are not as good as the originals!
4,the best of the series,I love a cozy mystery with lots of humor and I can well identify with the issues of a small Texas town. Love the characters and the romance. I wouldn't find having my own Jerry Don.This is the second in the Jolene Jackson Mystery Series.
2,Eh,"This book takes an interesting topic like functional programming and makes it hideously boring. In retrospect, I wish I'd bought Hudak's book instead. I read a review claiming that Mr. Thompson's book was better for newcomers to Haskell than Mr. Hudak's. I don't know where this idea came from; I later borrowed Hudak's ""Haskell School of Expression"" and found it to be more informative and faster-paced than this book. I give it two stars only because it is useful as a reference. If you're looking to learn Haskell and do cool things with it, get School of Expression instead."
4,More pressure than our old pump,The reviews were good for this pump. The price was cheaper than the previous pump we purchased. We are getting better water pressure with this pump. we are happy with this pump.
2,Lacking in the How-To Department,"This book has great pictures, but is it seriously lacking in the how-to department. There is one small chapter on how-tos, however, the rest of the book showcases the creations of various fashion doll customizers. If you are not looking for much on the how-tos of fashion doll customizing and you want to look at pretty pictures and get some ideas, this book is for you. If you are looking for a book heavy on the how-to of fashion doll customizing, this is not the book for you. What little information that is in the book and more, can be found on the internet if you are willing to do the research. Trust me, I found it."
5,Perfect,It really fits the grill perfect and it it heavy enough for it not to blow off. It smells like new tires when you open the box. I do recommend it for the medium size grill. It is really nice. I had paid more for the first cover I had and it tore and flew off.I do recommend it. I thinks it will be able to handle snow very well.
3,Too short,The product was great...but the length going down to the ground isn's very long. A third of my grill is now open because the cover doesnt reach down far enough.
3,Good enough.,It's exactly what you think it is ... there's nothing to get excited about it. It's a good cover at a good price.
3,Doesn't Last Forever!,"I purchased this grill cover on June 20, 2009. After about two and a half years I noticed some cracking. As time goes on there is more cracking. Contrary to what the manufacturer claims this item DOES NOT last 'forever'. This may be a great product if you store your grill under a patio roof. I contacted the manufacturer by e-mail and they sent me a new one with no problems."
5,Grill Cover,"Perfect fit for my grill! Looks great even after several months in the sun. It hasn't worn, torn, or faded at all. Love it!"
5,The Introduction for One Of The Most Clever Comedies Lately,"It's easy to know why ""30 Rock"" grabbed almost all Emmy awards of its category since its creation. The plot is full of awkward situations, unpredictable story lines, cynicism and yet it manages not to resort to absurdity or to the slightest display of profanity. Season One is and will always be a memorable introduction to a memorable TV show. Early or late fans can't afford not to have this set on their collection."
4,A Different Kind of Funny,"This show is pretty well done, but I would understand if certain people just can't stand it. I really enjoyed this shows humor, situations, actors, and cinematography. If you're a fan of Alec Baldwin, but you can't stand Tracy Morgan, or vice-versa, you should give the show a try anyway. Netflix it first, then if it was satisfying, buy it!"
1,Tuli's gell heel cups,"Was hoping these would help, but did not note a difference. Maybe when my heel is less painful, they will be useful in my shoes."
4,Work surprisingly well,I have a low meniscus and had micro-fracture surgery a couple years back on my knee. I got these because when I was snowboarding my knee would get a little sore while sitting on the lifts and after. These stay in place surprisingly well and made a pretty big difference on the impact to my knee. I'd say it helped the soreness on the lift by 90%.I would recommend anyone with arthritic knee / meniscus damage to try these out for impact absorption.
1,A Waste,"I bought these on the recommendation of a podiatrist to relieve (note i said relieve, not help nor cure) Plantar Fasciitis. I wore them for about a week and havent used them since. (1) they are not very comfortable and do not seem to stay in place. (2) as another reviewer mentioned, no arch support at all (obviously). and i have low arches, and still bothered me. They raise your heel, so naturally, there is nothing supporting your arch area. I think it caused more pain. (3) the cushioning provided by these cups seem to be in the wrong area for PF. at least for me. a big waste of money for me, as i bought 3. You live and learn, i guess."
4,Great cushion,"These were recommended to me by the orthopedist treating my occult heel fracture. Between utilizing a walk to run program and these heel cups, I am back to running 3-4 miles a day 7 days a week with no heel discomfort at all."
4,Treatment of 11 year old son severs disease,They work well for my son who plays basket ball. He needs to wear them all the time.We have a pair in everyone of my sons shoes.
4,Feels Nice,"Ultimately these heel cups arrived 2 - 3 days later than promised, so to get by I went to the local chain drug store and grabbed a pair of heel cups. This was my first attempt to walk without a crutch after having surgery on my Achilles tendon. The pair I got from the drug store provided no help. It was more of a burden than a support.When the Tuli's arrived and I put them in my sneakers and walked, I had an exhalation moment. I can't vouch for how they will work for you, but I am really glad I took the time to find these opposed to just working with whatever the local drug store provided.Late delivery was a real pain (literally)."
1,Warning: This is a FINAL SALE ITEM,"Warning: This item is a final sale item!Amazon will not take this back as a return.It is over 1/4"" thick and you will be ""walking out"" of your sneakers with this product.The back of the cup is very thin and buckles and does not sit against the rounded back of the sneaker. In other words, your sneakers will not longer fit you with these cups inside.I bought this because of all the positive ratings. What a disappointment!Now I can't figure why they have so many positive things being said about these cups.I called the company direct and spoke with their customer service manager and they said they wouldn't do anything about the problem.They really should say that this is a final sale item right on the first page, rather than you finding out about this when you try to return it."
5,Did the job!,My husband purchased these to help alleviate the stress on his heel while jogging. It worked! Very happy...and it was a quick ship!
3,Good but not as good as other Marcia Adams cookbooks,"The photos are wonderful in this book, and I've enjoyed quite a few recipies. The book isn't quite as completely appealing as the first Cooking From Quilt Country. I also find that there are errors in the recipies. I telephoned the publisher, Clarkson Potter, twice before finally getting an errata slip. A delicious muffin recipe had no flour in it!"
4,State by State,"The photographs in this book are stunning and highly appealing. The recipes I've tried are delicious. I particularly like the Swedish Pancakes, the Black Forest Torte, the Duck with Wild Rice Salad, and the Apple Pecan Pancakes. The recipes, however, are organized state by state, rather than by Appetizers, Salads, Soups, Entrees, etc. This makes the book great for skimming and finding an interesting recipe while browsing, but this also makes it difficult to look at all the appetizers, say, in one batch. As a result, I find myself using this cookbook less than I use others."
2,PASS,"If you have a good (or worse yet, a great) sound system, a fine appreciation of music, or value your hearing, PASS.Anna Tsuchiya is a great performer (her live concerts ROCK!!!!!), she has a cool style (english and japanese combo), a talented voice, and decent music skills - which all should make for a wonderful CD.But.....like way to many CD's these days, all that gets trashed in the mix. There is ONE (and ONLY one) dynamic range on this CD - it's set to about 9.5 (out of ten) and it just blares thru each and every song no matter how it was written or performed. Wrecks the ENTIRE listening experience. Perhaps if I didn't waste all that money on a high end sound system and just played it with a single speaker, mono clock/radio/cd player I might have enjoyed it better (probably not).So, there's $31 bucks down the drain."
4,Another Visual Delight from Majid Majidi,"Majid Majidi has directed another exquisite film that will please his fans and appeal to those who enjoy films that tell a simple, but meaningful story in a pristine fashion. In SONG OF SPARROWS the visual images are much more revealing of the underlying story than the dialogue is, in my opinion. Karim, played adeptly by Reza Naji, is an irascible patriarch whose ill fortune as a farm hand changes virtually by chance when he travels to the capital city of Tehran on his motorbike. As his good fortune brings more material objects to his simple country home, his troubles continue to plague him until fate literally comes crashing down on him and awakens him to the more important, simple pleasures of life. This movie will appeal especially to families, foreign film fans, and those enjoy cinematic art movies."
1,Too nasty,"I'd read most everything by Gene Wolfe thatI could lay my hands on. He tells the mostmarvelous stories. But, then I read ""AndWhen They Appear"". I guess having myown children to worry about, I was putoff by how he treated his - albeit fictional -child. What a horror. I haven't been ableto enjoy Wolfe ever since. Sad"
5,Krishnamurti does not answer.,"Reading krishnamurti's work, one gets the impression that he does not answer any questions directly.Instead, he draws you out into the open and ask you to look within yourself, ask you to ""see"" the situation clearly and keep guiding you back to the situation by asking/guiding you with probing questions.Krishnamurti does not answer your life's problem for you. There is no authority, no rules and no laws. He simply shows you the way to see into your own nature, just simple observation. Can you observe without a centre ? without ego/thoughts ? No one can explain his words more clearly then himself. I felt very fortunate to be able to experience his insights straight from the source."
2,$140 Headphone Should Not 'Just Fall Apart'. Do Not Buy!,"I loved these headphones while they were in one piece. Sure they were a little bulky but the sound quality more than made up for any inconvenience. I have always trusted the Bose name and was fully confident that my money would be well-spent.Just a little over 1 year after buying these one of the ear-cups just magically separated itself from the headband. It just came apart. I don't think I did anything to deserve this. I certainly didn't abuse them.I contacted Bose Customer Service and they pretty much left me high and dry. They've got my good money, but all I've got are earphones I can't enjoy.I came to Amazon to shop for replacements and learned that others have had exactly the same problem.One thing is clear, I will not be buying Bose headphones ever again."
2,Look elsewhere for better values,"When you move significantly above the $100 mark with headphones, one naturally expects superior sound and build quality - things that can be found with competing phones like the Grado SR125, Alessandro MS1, or even the Sony MDR-V6. For one thing, the body of these headphones is made of a relatively flimsy plastic, and lends little in the way of confidence in the product. The sound - the part that matters - may impress neophyytes with their strong bass, but balance and richness of tone are sorely absent. Perhaps that's why may TriPort owners find themselves defecting to other products.Bose has earned a name through aggressive advertising and name recognition, but if you're a savvy shopper (and are willing to look at some superb competing headphones (sometimes at half the price), you and your music will be in a better place."
2,"Great Sound, Bad Quality","I purchased a pair of the over-the ear headphones and, initially, was very pleased with the quality of the sound. However, about a year and a half later, the wire broke right at the connection on one of the ear cups.Needless to say, I was furious. I bought the headphones when they were $150, so I spent a decent amount of money on them. I didn't bother contacting Bose because I had long since thrown away the receipt.From investigating various high end headphones, I noticed one major flaw with Bose - extremely thin wiring to the ear cups. Many other brands have wires that are double the size of Bose. Monster even goes as far as having nylon covering for their wires to ensure flexibility and durability.I hope this is a feature that they improve upon in the future."
2,Not Impressed. They sound good - but poorly built,"I've been using these headphones for 2 years, I'm on my second pair. The build quality is unacceptable at this price point. the thin plastic can easily break, the housing for the padding rips. They're not particularly comfortable either.You can do much better for the money.another note - these are great at sound isolation once you put pretty much any music on. The ""quiet comfort"" versions are pointless.Really though, steer clear of bose in this department. it's an over rated and overpriced product."
1,It's only advertisement,"I read many books and some of them are very interesting and some other are poor. I bought this book with a positive expectaction due to the well-known success of the authors, but I was disappointed.From the first to the last page the entire book tries to sell the RealTick platform. It seems to me the only reason this book had been written.The authors treat the reader like a dumb-stupid-idiot with statement like this: ""why calculate rsi by hand if RealTick do the math for you?"", or ""fortunately the RealTick platform can calculate MACD"". Every software package can do these things.I suspect that the methods explained in the book, are poorly explained to leave the (ignorant) reader unsatisfied and with an urge to buy the RealTick platform...If you are an idiot buy this book and the RealTick platform :-)"
4,balanced meal ideas,"Really good book if you want to expand your macro-biotic cooking repertoire.There are nice references to the thermal nature of foods ( heating/ or cooling,Yin/Yang), that are helpful for those who want to create more balanced meals for their body type or the season. (No, I don't mean the food pyramid! hee hee )A nice addition to a natural cooking library."
5,The Best Album Ever!!!,"Toni Gonzaga is a fresh, beautiful, and talented actress/singer. This album gives it all. Her songs are amazing along with her beautiful voice.To all the people saying that the ""We Belong"" was copied from some Japanese song, well...you are so wrong. There are lots of song that have similar melodies with other songs. The lyrics are completely unique. All I know is, I enjoyed the cd and I don't bother anything about copying any melodies because its the songs that count.Toni's The BEST!!!"
4,Welcome To my Studio,"This book takes the reader through a step by step process, begining to end of creating a painting. It starts out by talking about setting up your composition (selecting your elements) and ends with examples of how to add finishing touches to make your painting sparkle.It gives many examples of still lifes but also includes studies of portraits and a few landscapes. This book is especially helpful because the author makes her points very clear through her written instruction along with pictures of her own paintings and the process of creating them."
4,"Good introduction, not reference material.","I have been programming with Java for a few years, but I've only just started to try and do some work with Java3D and this book provided a good introduction to the API. It really is a jump-start - introducing 3D concepts and the practicalities of implementing them in Java 3D without going into very much detail- sometimes a bit more would have been useful, but you could usually find what you needed in the API documentation. In fact, this almost acts as an index to that documentation- telling you that classes exist and how they relate to one another so that you can then look up the details of how to use them.There is definitely room for a detailed book on Java 3D, which this certainly isn't, but if you are looking for a general introduction you can't go far wrong here."
2,OK for a high level view,"If you want a 10,000 foot view of the exam this book is OK. If you aren't already familiar with routing protocols like BGP, OSPF, and EIGRP you'll need a more detailed reference... like a Cisco Press Exam Guide or CCO on line."
2,Mistakes and not enough materials,This book's organization is far from its Switching cousin. It has quite a few mistakes that can confuse readers. The exam alerts are useless. It does not have enough sample test questions for practice. It's maybe a good overview text.
3,Good enough to PASS the TEST!,"This is book is broder line. Good enough to pass the test. The first few chapters are basic, but then it goes depth with OSPF, EIGRP and BGP protocols. That covers about 90% of the test. The rest is general IP and subnetting information. There are some typos (but then again I have not read a book without any typos) and some of the review questions have the wrong answers. But, overall it is a good study guide."
5,Like my snowflakes,"These are great for decorating indoor /outdoor. There soft glow helps it to bring out that shiny sparkle in the night. The line needs to be a lot longer so one can show off there glow better. Have fun with these Stars, because there shapes will put a sparkle in your eye."
1,"Definitly not the best, won't be the worse ..","I'm sorry,I try to analyze good in every movie.., My only thought is why waste lights, camera and action on a project like this... When you get your chance, take your best shot..."
5,K&N - best u can get,Was pleased when they made one to fit a G8 - love K&N filters - cant get better than what they have
2,They don't appreciate our support,"First of all let me say that I am a serious reader. I purchase books before I even read what I've already purchased. Anyhow, I'm tired of supporting books marketed to African Americans, yet not being appreciated. Time and time again the books are riddled with errors and this is so unacceptable. You don't find this problem with other books. It's like their saying so what they are going to buy the books anyway. I'm really getting tired of being taken advantage of.Anyhow, I found this book to be unrealistic. This girl goes from being a young virgin to a professional whore in one breath. No street knowledge to a gansta girl tricking men for money. Just too unrealistic. The book was also kind of a slow read but picked up towards the end. The book was okay, however, not one of the best or one that I would really recommend."
1,Dont Buy This Book,This book was a high school read... The story was sad and the author seems uneducated. I had to make myself finish this book because I didn't have anything else to read and it took me forever to do that much. I wouldn't buy the sequel(s) and I wouldn't read this author again. The book is truly unbelievable she didn't even try to make it a little bit realistic... Borrow the book or get a used copy... don't buy it!
3,It was okay!!!,"Well for starters I think Shorty and I cant remember the characters name in the book was kinda out of control. Seriously.. I mean like she went madd overboard with the set-up of her dude and her dude's man. Some things I like about her as far as her non-tolerance I dont have time if your not on my level attitude. I was feeling that! But then towards the end it kind of left me on the end of my seat like, how in the world if she just got married to homeboy who was some type of recording artist. And umm, ol boy got out of jail and broke in their house? I mean like where was the security cameras and the dogs. Then dude just disappears in the dark like a shadow. And her man just laying their holding his pregnant wife. Now c'mon that's when I got pissed off. I didnt like how the book ended. But shorty was madd ganasta tho...Very hood. I would have to give this book 3 1/2 stars. I dont know Deja you did good, but I think you can do much better next time sweetie.."
3,I Beg To Differ,"I think I have to agree with what the other reviewer stated. Although I enjoyed the read, the editing was a distraction. Just about every book I've read from TCP has an editing problem. Then someone else posted, ""It wasn't that bad this time."" If you pick up a Steven King or Nancy Drew or any other book that isn't considered AALit you will get a book with ZERO errors in it at ALL. We, as a people, need to stop excepting this kind of work because in the long run thats all they will expect from us.Deja, you did your thing with this one sweetie, and I will be buying whatever you put out next. Good job for your first novel.TCP, it's time to step up the game. Get some editing going on over there or something. There is no way a book should be printed with that many errors with THAT MANY PEOPLE looking over it. Something has to be done."
2,"Stick to fiction, Larry !","I have enjoyed many of the author's books, such as ""Lonesome Dove:. That's be cause they were well-told stories. This is a short quasi-biography. He repeats information he covered chapters ago,, recycles, and winds up very disorganized. Stick to fiction, Larry !"
5,This is a very good book,"If you are interested in trees (Binary Search,Generic & Multiway ) & Graphs this book could be a very good reference. Common Data Structures are also dealt with very nicely."
2,Size deceptive,I thought based on the dimensions give online that this would fit out BBQ but it didn't...very misleading
3,Didn't last a season before ripping.,"Doesn't go to the bottom of my grill as depicted and it ripped in a few month's time.On the plus side, it has large, extra-strong Velcro tabs not found on other covers."
2,Eh,More of an overview; not really as good as advertised. If you're actually restoring one of these beasts you need to spend the cash and buy the actual LR mechanical guide.I have both & this book was quickly relegated to the bookshelf. Even If you don't buy the mechanical guide- you'll get more mechanically useful info from the LV blogs and websites.I gave it two stars because the pics will help orient the complete neophyte.
4,Review,"The book was delivered ahead of the projected time, and was in excellent condition. Just as it was stated in the ad. A very good price-quality ratio."
1,Sent back after only 1 use!,"I received this grill/griddle for my birthday and was so excited as it was exactly what I had wanted. My daughter used it to make bacon and eggs for my birthday breakfast, one time. When it was washed the nonstick coating was flaking off in several places and the rest had melded into a sticky mess. Terrible quality."
1,It's Junk,"It's Junk. I have the product for 6 months now, it lost the no stick coating and the whole product bent significantly from the heat of a GE gas stove. You get what you pay for with this one."
1,non stick is a bit sticky,"We got this griddle a few weeks ago and the only thing we can cook on it pancakes. Everything else sticks to this pan like crazy. To top it off you must be extremely careful when washing, as we have scratched off quite a bit of the non-stick surface. Be very careful with this pan. One more complaint is this pan does not like to stay level on our range. The design is such that it always tilts to one corner. And then so does the food. I would look elsewhere if you want a pan that will last."
2,There is a reason why Seow's grammar is relatively cheap.,"Having used this text in my introductory Classical Hebrew studies I found the order of the lessons to be incredibly illogical, jumping from one verbal stem to another and then back to the first, rather than covering each one individually and thoroughly. Further, the whole book is pedagogically atrocious. Practice exercises in the book recommend translations from the Tanakh that contain a great deal of grammar that has not yet been covered in the book, rather than offering simplified paraphrases. Further, the book offers no practice in translating from English to Hebrew, which is invaluable in learning Classical Hebrew. Instead, I would suggest Thomas Lambdin's grammar which, though a bit more expensive, is worth every penny."

3,Black is good color is sub par,"Black ink works well so far, but the color is barely adequate, don't expect to get anything close to photo quality"
5,Great product for low carb baking purchased at Amazon!,I have used this product for the past year to bake low carb muffins and cakes. I also made pancakes with this product and they were very good. This product is very helpful to people like me who have diabetes and wish to keep their carbs low and avoid processed flours.
2,"Dull, verbose and full of technical jargon.","Much of the material is entry level, which is a disappointment.The writer does not follow his/her own example. For example, he/she states that sequential callouts should always begin at 1:00 on the page. The example includes a callout beginning at 11:00.Anyone in this industry recognizes that simple, direct writing is required to keep the writer's attention. This book is dull and full of technical jargon.I hope this book improves."
3,So far... not bad,"I've only watched the first disc but so far it seems cool. At first I was like ""Wtf! Is she doing what i think shes doing?"", but then I realized shes supposed to be 18 or 19. Yeah I look forward to the rest of the series.Also this is a short series, only about 3 hours with 12 15min eps, subs only."
3,ASSEMBLY IS A WRECK!!!,"First of this trike is very well built. Worth the money. My complaints....... Instructions are alwful. They have a VERY small picture ofthe parts. They don't give a name for the parts. So during assembly you have know idea what they're talking about. Here's the real shocker, the instructions have the real wheel assembly backwards from the picture of the bike. I just put them together according to the picture. The wheels have that small metal cap that fits over the metal axel. It came with an extra, I broke both trying to get them on. If anyone has a trick for putting those buggers on please share!!! The stickers on the seat, they were coming off when I got it out of the box. I called the company up and they said they are working on shipping them out with better instructions. I told her my difficulties and the parts I broke and the stickers on the seatwere coming off and they are sending me out replacement parts tomorow."
4,AMAZING,"From the beginning this book had me hooked. The cliffhanger at the end makes me wonder when the SECOND one is supposed to be published. If you like stories to do with vampires, blood and romance, this is the book for you."
1,WARNING NOT AS LISTED !!!,"Description says ""Airborne Lemon Lime, 60 Count"". Everything is correct except for 1 minor detail....THERE ARE ONLY 10 IN THE PACKAGE. NOT 60!!! Minor detail. No where in the add does it say there are only 10. Several other sellers have the same thing listed at about the same price, so be careful."
1,watch out for target seller,"received item but only 10 count box and not the 60 count box listed. not sure if just an isolated case, but i don't like that instead of making up the difference i now have to return the item and reorder. hassle! :("
3,"It's Ok, but the color is a bit darker than you saw","I order this last month and it arrived in good shape. The only disappoint is the darker color than show in the picture. Its weight is ok and it's confortable in the winter, not good for the summer."
3,Christ the Sum of All Spiritual Things,"Nee's works are always profitable. This particular writing is interesting but somewhat esoteric. The words, as always, are plain but how to receive it in one's spirit is difficult."
1,I got a broken item and the company dose not answer back!,"I wouldn't buy anything from this company, I got the item and it was takn to a professional company for installation and the item was not working. also they didn't answer my emails or any of my complains..."
4,Great!!!! Slight limitations but still worth it....,"You have to send your contacts to the radio and you only have 3 speed dials on radio but other than that its a great device, i have an HTC touch pro and i love it.."
4,"Great price, great product",This is a very good basic blender. It is not too fancy with excess features. I bought this as a factory-reconditioned unit and it is in perfect condition and was a great price.
4,Very Unique Recording - Symphony Quality,A very different version of Journey music. If you like classical or Symphonic music you will love this along with Steve Perry's and Greg Rollie's unique exquisite voice qualities. It makes me want to see the movie that this Soundtrack was developed for in 1980. Beautiful listening experience!
1,Not a durable wand...,"The GlowaveGlowavelooked to be lots of fun for a fairy princess, but even with a fairly calm 4 year old and good parental supervision, it only took two days for curiosity to demand that Glowave be whacked against a surface hard enough to put an end to it. In fairness, the flexible outer tube didn't break even though it was permanently creased, but the tube appeared to melt and made me a little concerned about safety. So after two days, the glowave met its end. Perhaps in older hands that aren't tempted to pretend Glowave is a sword, or otherwise test its durability, it may make a fairly entertaining toy. On the plus side, brighter and longer than I thought it would be."
5,Awesome product,This is an awesome product! I am very tough on my phone-this product protects it very well!
4,Funny and accurate!,"I saw this movie in the theater and thought it was very funny and endearing. I have friends in several aspiring bands, and the portrayal of Circus Monkey's fight to be recognized is spot-on. The personalities in the band and their various reasons for what they do are true-to-life, also. The actors do a decent job (Kevin Corrigan's Southern accent is surprisingly good), but the best character has to be Doug MacMillan's legendary road manager Linus Tate. Also, for folks from the Southeast, there's a large ""been there, done that"" quotient."
1,Will be returning it tomorrow,"I shopped hard to find a quality Egg Poaching Pan for a reasonable price. I guess it doesn't exist and I will have to tap my budget a little harder and buy the $75.00 pan. As other reviews stated, the pan handle gets very hot, the egg cup handles are virtually impossible to manage because of their angle and wire design, and the tray that holds the cups has a poorly designed ring in the center to lift with, and it is difficult to manage as well. I was planning to modify the tray handle, and bend the cup handles up, but the most important flaw is the cup itself. I wanted to avoid the non-stick coatings but all the less expensive pans use it. If they are going to call it NON STICK, then the eggs shouldn't stick. Yet they stick whether you use nothing, butter, or oil, and they are a pain to clean. So back it goes and I will ponder another brand that is better constructed and has no non-stick coating! I can't recommend this to anyone."
4,Ewa-Marine Camera Bag,"This review comes a little too early for me since I haven't been able to fully test it out, but I wanted to comment on it while I was thinking of it. I wanted to get something that would keep my SLR from getting wet while I kayaked - I won't be doing any scuba diving.The bag fits many different size SLR cameras including the Fujifilm S2. It's big enough to cover an attached flash. The lens fits in a place where the bag can expand which is nice if you're using a lens that sticks out about 5 or so inches. There is no practical way to get to the lens while it's in the bag, so zooms may be a little tricky to work with. There is an indented place to put your finger to get to the button. The bag is pretty thick so manipulating switches on your camera is a little difficult. It's a pretty big bag, but I think it will serve my needs well."
1,"terrible, misinformated, HORRIBLE!!!!!!","Este libro es terrible, y lo peor es que es usado como herramienta de educacion sexual, este tipo (el autor) se hace rico diciendo a la gente pura basura, cometiendo errores garrafales tales como decir que los homosexuales son unos enfermos o que la mejor forma de evitar embarazos es la virginidad. Atenta contra la naturaleza humana"
5,Helpful Read for Studying the Italy Portion of WWII,"This is a very detailed writing of the Italy portion of World War II. The book is fascinating if you are a war veteran or student of this war, in particular. My father-in-law was in Italy while my mother-in-law was home in the U.S. for 3 years without him during the war. The Battle for Italy fills in many gaps of silence that those not there may never know without reading this. Well written and highly recommended!"
5,"Required reading for parents, judges, attorneys","Filled with short letters from children to the judge, ""Dear Judge"" will at times make you laugh and at times make you believe in the family court system, but mostly it will point out the ways the court system and parents fail to take a child into consideration. When a young child has a question they generally turn to their parents, but when the parents say they can't take them somewhere, or see them more often, or otherwise satisfy the needs of the child because the court system constrains them they have to take other measures. These children took their pleas to the judge. Encouraging, disheartening, and enlightening, ""Dear Judge"" should be read by judges, parents, and attorneys alike."
5,Great Read!,"Kudos to Irwin Silber!I throughly enjoyed reading this book. He did an exceptional job of telling his story. I am looking forward to having my hip done next month. Reading his book first, has helped to prepare me. I have also received excellent information from my Drs. terrific website. In fact, the website and the book complement each other.M. E. Wait, California"
1,"This drive, and it's internal equivalent are unreliable","I purchased 2 of the external 400G drives, and 2 of the internal drives when they first became available. I wish that I had waited for the reviews. All 4 have given me nothing but troubles. All of the drives experience the same problem. After copying large amounts of data to or from the drives, they spin down with a loud click. When the internal drives do this, my pc locks up, and I must reboot. When the external drives do it, they can be power cycled and return for several more Gigs of copy before repeating the problem. At first, the problem was intermittent, but now it's regular enough that I plan to call Seagate tomorrow to get replacements. My recommendation is to stay clear of these drives. I wish that I had. Maybe the Hitachi 400 Gig drives will be better."

4,Country's best!!!,"If you've never heard Gram Parsons, you will probably want to start with the GP/Greivous Angel album from 1972. However, this is a fine example of Gram's new tradition. He has literally forged a new brand of popular music, but this birth of Americana seems to come without any birth pangs. This album is guaranteed to give a peaceful, easy feelin to all true country fans out there. A must have."
2,The content is a little thin,"I liked the conceptual portion at the beginning of the book. The idea of incorporating unstructured data with a data warehouse is something I've done in the past, and he makes a nice case for having both. The rest of the book is of questionable value.There are many data warehouseing or web books that provide better overviews of protocols and standards, which take up space that could be put to more practical use explaining how to build systems rather than labeling parts.The other big problem is that a lot of the book is dedicated to product information. It mentions products that vanished around the time the book was published (Junglee, for example). The information on companies providing data extraction, parsing and online information products and services is hopelessly out of date. So is information on metadata standards, which changed drastically from 1998 to now."
4,"Step-by-step, but not much variety","Great instructional book for building a traditional style fireplace surround (title a bit misleading - the mantel is only the shelf above a fireplace - the surround is the mantel, columns, etc.) Limited, though in that it only covers one style surround with different variations.If you like the style of fireplace surround on the cover of the book, then buy it. It steps you through building that style in ""great"" detail."
3,Fun!,"This book was fun and all, but the writer made a few mistakes. (1) Angel is 244 yrs old, not 246 and (2) Faith killed the cloven foot vamp with the big stake, not Buffy! The writer should have brushed up on her Buffy facts before writing it!"
2,Amrock inspirations 4-pk oil-rubbed pulls,"The pulls were terrific, however, the add for ""pulls 4-pack"" mislead me as only two were included in each 4-pack. That lead to a much higher price than indicated. After that problem I ordered the rest of the pulls that I needed from another company"
2,The Tamed West,"Mae West was so displeased with this bland adaptation of the Broadway hit ""Personal Appearance"" that she mentioned it only once in her autobiography. Thanks to Hays Office censorship, ""Go West, Young Man"" (1936) lacked the comic spark of Mae's earlier films, with few classic one-liners and a tamed West stuck in rural Pennsylvania. Co-star Randolph Scott and director Henry Hathaway fared better in their Zane Grey collaborations. The weakest of Mae's Paramount vehicles."
5,A rap song with an attitude,"Ms Jackson rocks! What a great song, I have to admit the lyrics and tune are still bouncing around inside my head and I keep smiling every time I think about the dogs and cat in the video who seem to be rapping along with the singers, for some reason this makes the song more poignant, and though I know that some of the words are meant to be serious, some sardonic, there is also an element of humour in this song, visual as well as verbal. Outkast certainly have done themselves justice with this single, I only wished they had included the video on the CD, as I would have loved to have played it on my computer. Go out an buy it, you won't regret it I promise you."
5,Amazing Peter James!,"I strongly recommend this author I have recently discovered. I've read his book Dead Simple and really enjoyed it. I ran to buy Looking Good Dead and, honestly, I don't want to finish it before buying a third story of James's detective Roy Grace.Excellent criminal thrillers, intelligent plots, gripping character -Roy Grace-... The pleasure of reading!Gabriela Keselman"
3,Falls a bit flat.,"I think that this may be the last Peter James detective novel that I attempt to read. Although his work gets quite good reviews from fans, I don't find them to be my cup of tea. This is my second attempt at a Roy Grace book, and the second time that I've wound up disappointed.It *was* reasonably entertaining. I often found the prose awkward, but that's not so unusual in detective novels. Unfortunately, I found the plot sadly predictable, and that's much more difficult for me to forgive. James is a reasonable hand at character, which is the only reason that I'm wavering on giving up on his books. Can anyone recommend a Roy Grace book by him that they really like?"
5,Jane Wells is extremely courageous,Jane Wells is an extremely brave woman. The book is easy to read and brings into focus the hardships that Jane had to face and her courage and bravery for surviving! An exceptional book
4,good cd,"Awesome solo cd from this rapper, his next cd the peoples champ is definately gona be huge. i can listen to this one end to endbest songs: why you peepin me, am what i am, my lifedyke jones comes with the same tired raps on the opening track which was a disapointment.get this cd!"
1,Transvestite Magnet,This cd is atrocious. The only thing that is good about Paul Wall is that he is very consistent. He is consistent with putting out poor music. Go drown your self Paul wall.
4,Ivory Towers are hard to find,"This book was more suspense and I liked it that way, yes there are two possible suiters for Prof Rose Fenemore, but what kept this read going was the how the whole island mystery would work out for all the characters. Fenemore may be a don, but I liked her inner quips about herself and that the idea of bird watching with her brother would actually be considered an enjoyable vacation.A quick and enjoyable read on a gloomy day, midges not required."
5,short and sweet,I really enjoyed this little book. It isn't nearly as long as some of her others but it is very interesting.
5,Profound and Joyful,"This is great music and lyrics. If you're tired of all of the CCM noise, please come here for refreshment. Starting with ""That's All the Lumber You Sent"" every song is a call to grow in the Holy Spirit. It teaches me to celebrate my faith and to press onward."
5,What else can I say???,"Goodness gracious, is there anyone else out there who can pack so much information in so few pages about the essence of Cisco switching than this guy can?!? This man is simply awesome!! If you could not pass the exam with a perfect or near-perfect score, then you didn't read all the pages (or you simply forgot) - because this is ALL YOU NEED, period. Thanks, Richard!"
3,It's an idea book...,"I love her flavor combinations.Some of her recipes have worked for me. Others I have had to adjust: they are too thick (too much pectin?) and / or the sugar doesn't completely dissolve (too much sugar?). It's an idea book and a trial and error book for me. I am so relieved to read the other reviews regarding the amount of sugar and pectin.This isn't a book for a brand new jam maker -- in my opinion,the recipes are too 'hit or miss.'"
4,LOTS OF FUN,"This cd is a definite 4 star for me. It's been interesting reading the other comments. Many compare this with the duets Marvin Gaye did with other women. That reaaly doesn't apply here for Diana Ross's voice is very different and very pure.Many also seem to think he definitely outsings her. I must admit that I am not a huge Marvin Gaye fan but I find that both are showcased well with this collection. YOU'RE A SPECIAL PART OF ME and MY MISTAKE are the big hits and strongest cuts but there is not a song here I dislike. I find it to be a very eclectic collection and put it on repeat in my cd player. For me, Ms. Ross was releasing some high quality solo work during this period and this cd fits very nicely into my collectioon. (Believe it or not I never owned the album so it is a special treat for me.)The remastering is excellent and if you love either artist it is a must have."
5,DIANA & MARVIN CD 1973,What a WONDERFUL CD that Diana Ross and Marvin Gaye produced in 1973!! I had never heard any of the songs and I can honestly say that I enjoy each and every song on the CD!! If you love their music you will not be disappointed in this classic cd!
5,Cockateils love this,This was the best size for my cockateils they love this like they love treats!! the cockateil size was too big for one of my birdies so I had to crush it to make it smaller. So this size is just perfect for them.
3,Stink Finger,"I have Vol 1 but truthfully I bought Vol2 just to hear ""Stink Finger"" by Frank Jr. Too funny. It's good late night fun."
5,Son Of The Beach: Volume 2,"Never recieved it in the mail. The seller mailed it with delivery confirmation so I contacted The Post Master at my post office after I aloted the time estimated by the sellar it would arrive. The post master, after investigation stated that it was delivered by a mail carrier that was a subsitute that day and is trying to check where it was delivered. But says "" There is no way of tracking that shipment. Only can wait to see if place where it was delivered returns it to the post office."" So I can't review it until (??) arrives which it doesn't look like that will happen. The mail system strikes fails again! The seller mailed the product out quickly but postal system failed delivering product. No happy holiday for me I suppose."
4,A GREAT LIVE ALBUM WITH ALL HIS HITS,THIS LIVE ALBUM RECORDED IN POLAND HAS A NICE SOUND TO IT I HAVE THREE LIVE ALBUMS OF CASH AND THIS IS FAR THE BEST!
5,Whets the appetite for Baja adventures,"Gardner, the acclaimed author of the Perry Mason courtroom novels shows his passion for adventure in this true-life account of his explorations into the remotest regions of Baja California, including places where few people have ever visited and returned to tell of it. But Gardner and his friends returned with stories and photos.Sure, this adventure took place decades ago and in some respects it is dated, even quaint, (check out the weird vehicles they use!) but there's something here that captures the essence of Baja exploration in ways that are likely to whet the exploration appetite of Baja experts and novices alike.And to be sure, there is much left to explore in Baja.And for Perry Mason fans, this book will be a treat for those who wish to get to know the author in a very real way. He seems to be one of those men whom you couldn't help liking."
5,Simple Recipes for a Wonder-filled Life,"Excellent vid. Easy to see; clear understanding of how to make the recipes. Recipes are not only on the vid, but also in written form so you don't have to scan the vid to find what you want when you want to make it. What I love about this is, the ingredients are familiar and easy to find, the recipes are simple and no long prep time... LOVE 'EM!Get it now! You'll love how easy it is to add raw foods to your food program."
1,Clumsy and annoying,"This was impossible to get in and out of the case, and the heat was never distributed evenly. Couldn't use it."
1,Horrible,This is not worth the money you spend or the time you spent looking for it. The material is horrible and the workmanship goes right alone with that fact.
1,Lacks Quality,The robe is already falling apart and am very very dissatisfied with the quality... the seam in one of the arm cuffs has come undone and the hook to hang it on - at the collar broke off... All in all - very very disappointing...
3,An okay read.,"I was really looking forward to this book and I finally got it and read it and wasn't too impressed by it. In a nutshell, the book is dull. It seems as if the author just focuses on a few of the independent tank battalions that served in WWII and ignores the rest. The biggest disappointment in this book is there are no maps in it. It is hard trying to follow the flow of the action and not have a clue where some of these locations were that the author was talking about. About the only good thing about this book is the author lists the history of each of the independent tank battalions at the end of the book. If you have some extra cash laying around then buy this book. If you are on a strict budget, get it at the library."
1,Terrible tip...,"I own this tip as well as the long, thin ISI tip. This one is just a waste of money-it doesn't spray the cream out nicely. The cream gets left inside the tip, and compared to the other tip, this one is just useless."
1,Caution!!,"WARNING!!. ......If you are a traditional catholic, I advise you not to buy this book (actually, no one should). Some of the images are selected from artists who did not respect modesty in their subject. Also, the author includes such trivialities as a tattoo on somebody's arm. I consider at least one image to be blasphemous due to its revealing nature."
5,already had,I love the Vicar of Dubley....however I already had Series 2 and didn't realize it...so more then a week ago I I returned it and have not heard from you as of yet....could you please look into this matter...thank you Joan Custer
1,lite brite paper refiill set,"It's a refill set for a lite-brite mini not a regular lite brite. Guess that's my mistake but I feel like I didn't see that anywhere on the packaging. For me, it was a complete waste of money. Anyway, thanks."
2,Not enough pegs to finish,"I bought this as a refill to my flat screen lite brite. I didn't expect a refill to require more pegs than I have available. I had to be creative with colors to complete the pictures. Still fun, I bought it for my kids to be entertained and they don't care about the colors but if you do, buy a refill of pegs to go with this."
1,"Good, if you're not a fan of Magneto","Planet X is a good storyline, if you don't count the complete bastardization of Magneto; the transformation of a Jewish Holocaust survivor to a sadistic, bumbling Nazi who herds humans into crematoriums and snorts up mutant drugs. It's no surprise that Marvel Comics retconned the story so soon after it came out."
5,FINALLY ANSWERED,FINALLY!!!I had actually emailed the people of Spin City near 4-5 years ago asking why there weren't any seasons out on DVD and only selected episodes...This show is seriously my all time favorite... everything flows great in Spin City with Michael J. Fox... although I never watched the continued episodes with Charlie Sheen... (didn't want to take the chance of him screwing it up!)Can't say season 1 is my favorite... but it does save a lot of time and space on my television DVRing the shows :pHurry and release the other seasons QUICK!!!!
5,Catchy Title!,How can you go wrong? The works of Irving Berlin and the adorable Ms. Horne on full and fine flow.Any followers of the lady or the music will love this album but it may not be the best to introduce you to the works of either the singer or the composer.For me it was an experience to enjoy.
3,Good. But Buy It Only If Serious,"I bought this book hoping to find a lesson on game theory and applied economics. While I studied both in college, I was never the strongest of mathematicians and as a result I found this book a bit technical. While I understand the Author was writing for perhaps a different audience, I have had sufficient exposure to both calculus and econometrics that I feel I should not have felt lost at times.This is not the best book for someone looking for an introductory look at game theory. In addition, the book is really not oriented toward anyone that is not a serious practitioner or not seeking to really crack the math. As a result, unless you are serious, I would discourage you from buying this book."
3,one of good books to start game theory,"I think it is a good book to know about game theory.But for asians, some sentences are somewhat hard to understand clearly.So my friends and I spent a little time to understand clearly.However, it is a good book because it has plenty of examples.Don't try to know all the examples. Picking some examples is a better wayfor starters to understand and study game theory"
1,Error-riddled Kindle Edition,"Don't buy the Kindle Edition. The typesetting is horrible, it is impossible to read. What's more, there are typos everywhere, and some of the formulas are incorrect and certainly do not match the original, printed version.With most mistakes you can puzzle out what the original probably says, but at one point, the author intends to use a cumulative probability function F(x) and then f(x) to denote its derivative, but the Kindle Edition depicts them both capital F(x). I'm a patient man, but that's what prompted me to write this review and warn others away.Maybe it'll do in a pinch if you really, really hate printed books, but avoid if at all possible."
4,Good product,I have tried this shampoo and happy with the reults. I have relaxed african american hair that tends to be dry thanks to Minnesota winters and this shampoo doesnt dry out may hair which is very important to me. I am always looking for better products out there and this is one i am willing to come back to if my search turns and futile. I do like the fact that it is sulphate free. I have also tried giovanni 50:50 shampoo and this is way better.
2,Far from His Best,"If you are stuck in a rut of ordinary, tread-worn practices at your work, this book might help snap you out of your funk.But if you are looking for keen insights and practical solutions to real business problems, this definitely will not move you to action.I've read almost every one of Peters' books. This one is sub-par.Since an author needs to keep publishing to stay on the lecture circuit, this feels like an attempt to augment the Powerpoint slides Peters must have been carting around when this book was published.It's becoming harder to believe what Peters preaches, because everything he does now is so over the top, it's his new normal.I am a huge Tom Peters fan, but being ""out there"" just to remain relevant is not working anymore."
3,"Creative and Chaotic, But Possibly Disastrous","Tom Peters is a management prophet with a lot of fascinating ideas. This book is a collection of his thoughts where you'll see a strong emphasis on destroying superfluous hierarchies and worn-out practices. That's the Peters message and it's worthwhile. However, he has an annoying tendency to insist on his own authority that businesses make radical changes lest they perish. In many cases, I wonder why. Peters has no apparent respect for the point of view that tradition represents collected wisdom about things that have worked and may well keep working.What really ruined the book for me, though, was a panel discussion on diversity in which Peters attributes his own success to being a white male Protestant born in 1942. That kind of racial reductionism is horse-puckey and contradicts his emphasis on self-determination and constant renewal.I still give the book three stars for entertainment value, a smart format, and general provocation."
2,Not a Lot of Wow,"A book only a family member could love. Topics include: what Tom thinks of maple syrup, the Peterman catalog, and Amerigo Vespucci. Questions answered: Does Tom jog, swim, or walk? Does Tom like the new Italian restaurant near his Vermot estate? And speaking of Vermont estates: What is his happiest memory of spring? If you are hell-bent on getting answers to those burning questions, then this book is for you.Insights range from the helpful if somewhat inane (you can change in a second, but making good on change takes commitment and time... or design matters) to the plain old whacko (""revel in life's yeastiness."")I'm not saying there aren't good insights or that the book is a dull waste. Peters is a good storyteller with a lot of business wisdom. It's just too bad he puts neither skill to much use in this droll dress-up of dross."
3,It's OK I guess...,"Had I to do it over again, I woulda bought a different lamp even if it meant spending a couple more dollars. Like they all said, it gets VERY hot and it tips over very easily. The silver metal rings on the lamp heads fall off all the time. It also has blown a couple fuses, but usually when I am vacuuming or using a lot of power for something else, so I have to turn it off or unplug it at these times. But, it gives me light, which I need in my basement room. I suggest spending a couple more dollars on a higher quality lamp though."
3,Sticky sockets,"This lamp is fine. It looks standard enough for any decor. If you need a cheap fixture quickly, this one does the trick. That said, don't be surprised if the bulb sockets are poorly cut."
5,Awesome first chapter books!,"The books that got my six year old to read, and continue to read!Thank you Kindergarten Teacher and Mary Pope Osborne.Our daughter love them AND they are educational!"
4,Great Pictures!,"The pictures in this book are wonderful! I browsed through the books at the store and this book struck me as having scenes my 2 year old could really relate to, such as building blocks, bathtime, snacktime, etc.Many extra details are in the pictures which really kept my toddler's attention. She loves to label everything she sees.We own too many books that just aren't very fun to look at because the pictures are too abstract or there isn't enough detail.The story is simple, yet bedtime envoking! Little Anna bunny follows a bedtime routine and reminds Gramps bunny about everything they need to do before bed. It ends with Anna in her bed fast asleep.Books about bedtime seem to work best when I'm reading my little one to sleep. 'It's Too Soon' was a wonderful find!"
4,Dive into the Deep Blue!,"I thought Grouper Moon was a pretty good book. Renny, the main character, is a boy who loves the water. One day he was swimming in the reef and finds a groto. This was a cool part (page 29) when the auther, Cynthia Shaw, decribed the home of the nasau grouper, Cooper. Cooper is a solitary but lonly fish. Later Cooper has to decide on what to do about his lonlyness and finds that it isn't that easy. But now they are building huge diving resorts on Renny's island home, but most of all the Grouper Moon is aprotching and Renny hopes that Cooper will not get cuaght in the fray. some feeling this book made me feel were the bonds between Cooper and Renny and the cool beuty of the reef and groto. I liked this book alot and i hope you will enjoy it to."
3,"Mini Mortar and Pestle,stainless steel","The material is very sturdy,shinny and looks very nice, but the size is so small that I do not have real use for it.However I collect mortar s and pestles so I don't mind. The price is all right and I was pleased to hear that they do deliver to US terrotories."
3,Please note: this is a 60 count bottle,"For some reason the count is not listed in the product description. Just so there is no confusion in light of the big discount, each bottle contains 60 pills of 650mg."
1,Huh?,I am a librarian. We have this book in our collection only because it was given to us for free. I'm not sure what all of the praise is for. It is puzzling to me.
3,Daughters of Eve: Strength for Today from Women of Yesterday,"I misplaced my original copy of this book. I ordered this copy based on the cover advertised. I was appalled at the old outdated cover that certainly was not diverse received. I was led to believe that this was the latest edition based on the cover displayed by the seller. The cover was offensive and not a cover that I would proudly display. It was delivered in a timely manner. I'm thankful that the author changed the cover! I enjoyed readying the content in the past and despite my disappointment, I do recommend the book that is why I wanted another copy, but I will probably be throwing this copy away or tearing off the cover and perhaps one day purchasing a more current copy. I will attempt to contact the author and express my concern and gratitude to the author for changing the cover! This review is written to requests that the seller be more accurate in their advertising."
1,Life...Life...Life...,This book was off the hook i read it in one day.If you buy this book you will not be disappointed. LIfe was off the hook and everybody in this book suffered some kind of lost. Leo keep doing your thing and keep the books coming
1,"meandering,boring","I love Karunesh Call of the Mystic but Zen Breakfast is meandering, without variety and just not very interesting. I'm not sure what you could use it for. You could use it as background for meditation but I prefer the tamboura drone for meditation. I guess I understand the reviewer who said if you like this monotonous stuff you may as well listen to the Japanese and Chinese masters."
1,boring,"This is the first album I've listened to by Karunesh sincehis earlier, extremely varied and creative work ""Sky's Beyond"". This one is boring and repetitious to the MAX, and Govi is about the best thing about the album, all of a total of 4 or 5 minutes!As one cut, it is beautiful and relaxing, but multiply it by 10and it becomes a rip-off, at least in IMHO."
1,Nice giveaway maybe,Like the rest of the reviewers I thought I had the feeling I had better spent my money on something more useful than this book. The only useful thing you may do with this is use it as a giveaway to someone who has no experience with software based music making but who may become curious by reading this thin book with cd. Otherwise a waste of your hard-earned money.
1,Fruity loops bible,FL Bible is a better deal for around 40 dollars has about 450 pages and all kinds of tips
4,keeps ladies issues under control.,Seabuckthorn oil is the Ladies Omega! Has helped with a bunch of menstrual issues and skin too! Take at night like other omegas because that is when our bodies need it. Great Stuff!!
5,Works as advertised.,This is a great product and my wife and myself can tell the difference when taking this. The only problem is it is hard to get.
5,The guide to have for the auto tourist,"This is quite simply the most informative, comprehensive, descriptive, and fascinating educational tour guide for the motorist I have ever seen. The subtitle is correct...nearly every mile is documnented in detail discussing the geology, history, and uniqueness of some of the most beautiful scenic by-ways in the nation. It'll have you pulling over to the side of the road at every mile marker. Also included; side trips, dirt roads, more comprehensive sections on popular destinations and a very clear outline of routes and highways one should take to get the most of you journey. Seeing the mountains and rivers of central Idaho with this book in hand was truly a thrill. I came away from this trip not only enriched by the spectacular beauty of the region but more informed about the processes and people that helped shape and form this dramatic region of our country."
3,Jerdon HL95N 5X Magnification Two Sided Mirror,"The product is well made and easy to install. However, the light inside the mirror not bright enough. A higher wattage bulb is necessary."
4,Good Start !,"This book has enough information to start your task at marketing your book. Contacts,phone numbers,addresses,and some websites.That are all good. There are many hurdles to becoming a successful author. Consider this book your introduction to it. All Good!"
4,Detailed and well organized.,This book covers in detail wildlife painting. Has lots of great tips like fur detail and lots of step by step areas taking you from the photo all the way to the finished painting. My only minor qualm is that it takes you from photo to finished product in about 8 steps. It might be hard for a beginner to make the leaps from step to step. I would have recommended doing the steps in smaller increments. Overall very good based on texture tips alone. It shows you how the artists get that super detailed fur!
1,Do not purchase,"cheapest piece of garbage I have ever purchased, I would NOT recommend this to anyone at all! I wish I could just get my money back"
5,Thank you Mr. Wilson,"I wouldn't recommend this book as a casual summer read...it's more like a grand experience to spend time with Wilson's fine mind and generous style. ""God's Funeral"" is a book for my personal library, to read more than once, to highlight and make personal notes in its margins, to lend to friends...to just sit and think about.I read Wilson's fiction, ""Vicar of Sorrows"" several years ago and had a hard time shrugging off the depressing story about the depressive Vicar and wondered from what dark places Wilson drew his narrative even though his protagonist, ""Little Boy""/Francis Kreer took me into the palm of his hapless hand almost from the start.If you are curious at all about Wilson's newest work don't hesitate to buy ""God's Funeral."""
3,Not what I was expecting,"First of all, this is not about the decline of faith in Western Civilization; it is about the decline of faith and the rise of secularism in England. The United States has actually become less secular in the last century and Christianity is still a strong force in the USA. Second of all, this rehash of all of these tired and tedious Victorians will baffle many readers when many of the persons mentioned here are forgotten. Wilson admits that no one reads Herbert Spencer or Carlyle anymore and then spends chapters telling us about these people who no longer matter. Some of this is interesting is a sort of BBC drama, gossipy history sort of way. I'm not sure what Wilson was trying to do and I am not sure if he knew himself."
3,At thimes interesting,Some of the stories were dated but some interesting short stories. Less about alein sex and more about human emotions.
2,Nikwax Footwear care kit for leather,"Received fast, however this was to be used for my husband who has an expensive pairof bate boots. Not happy with overall shine very dull would not buy again."
5,"Vater Monster Brushes, Rock","I love these things. I use them on my set of congas, conguitos, bongos and cymbals with great results. They are adjustable but they sound best ""full closed"". Your hand drums will acquire a new dimension. They are a little hard to play because you can't count on much of a ""bounce back""... you'll have to move them yourself! Practice and you'll get it. They'll teach you some discipline, actually. Higly recommended."
4,Not Your Father's Brushes,"Well made, this brush impressed me as being on the heavy side. I found myself adjusting the balance in holding it, to get more speed and finesse. Another piece for the stick arsenal, and will give a whole other range of attacks."
2,"Great wallet, poor workmanship","I'm on my third Slimmy. The first one was flawless, with red fabric on the interior. It lasted a long time, and I'd probably still have it if it wasn't stolen. I've bought two since, each with a different camo fabric in the interior. Unlike the first one I bought, the newer wallets feature fabric that is cut larger and looser than the leather it lies against, quickly forming seams in the fabric. The leather is awesome, and some of the best thin leather I've come across. But seams in the liner fabric (cotton?) show through, and eventually become seams in the leather. Is that being too picky? Perhaps. But when buying a high quality leather wallet like this defects distract from the otherwise smooth feel and look. At this price I'd expect Koyono to get it right."
5,For those looking for a slim wallet/card holder: THIS IS IT,"The design is simple: four stacks of leather sowed together on two sides. You have 3 slots to put in whatever you want in whichever order you choose. I carry a school id, state id, metro-card, durane reade card, credit card, debit card and money in the wallet and the width never exceeds one inch. It's comfortable to fit in your front pocket without being bulky and noticeable. It's durable too, as I've been using it everyday for more than 2 years now and the construction is just as sturdy as the day it came. It's very convenient to take out my metro card everyday or when I have to show my id as I can easily find my cards. The only downside I can see new users not getting used to is the security as it spills out the items pretty easily when dropped. Otherwise there's no reason why anyone shouldn't own one. It's simple, durable, affordable and good looking. Good for men or women or children alike."
4,How Do I Look?,I really appreciate the variety of lighting options! Now I know how I look both in natural and office work lights.
1,&#65279;DISTORTED MIRROR,"I bought this mirror because I have trouble putting on makeup without my glasses. I thought that this mirror would be great for me because of the 5X magnification.Boy was I wrong, all I got was a distorted view of my face. I have a round 5X magnification mirror that's clear as a bell, but it's small, and I can't see my whole face. Well now I know that NOT ALL MIRRORS ARE CREATED EQUAL. Don't buy it,it SUCKS."
1,Ordered two for presents...Didn't work...,I was disappointed that the mirrors didn't work after I plugged them in. From what I've read in these reviews I think the manufacturer needs to rework the design to include better quality bulbs. Had to return them.
2,"nice light, but doesn't last long","I bought this about a year ago, and the light doesn't turn on anymore. The bulb is out, but it is hard to replace it- you would have to open up the whole mirror to be able to do that. Before I bought it, I saw the review here of a man who bought it for his wife and he said to just hold the ""on"" button and it would turn on. I think the model he bought his wife was another one because mine had an on and off switch, so obviously I couldn't hold it down to try that suggestion. While it was working, the mirror was pretty good, but the only setting I used was the ""daylight"" setting. The others were settings that I didn't need, like one that gave a green tint. The way it is leaning is pretty flimsy. I would accidentally hit it and it would slam down. It was decent while it lasted, but one year was not long."
2,Wrong Voltage,"Unfortunately it was the wrong voltage for this Country but they very kindly said they would refund the money to me, as the postage to return it was 34.60, more than the light.The light was good but a pity it didn't work in the UK. A shame when you can buy a camera and an I-Pad in the States and only need a plug adapter!"
4,great for the price,I bought 2 for a couple teen girls. They love it and that's all that mattered to me. Great gift for the price
1,Not big enouogh,"I thought it would be alittle bigger, but it wasn't. Lightening not so good either. will be sending back soon"
1,Light stopped working after a few uses,"I purchased this about a year ago. The lights only worked for about a month. I followed all of the instructions as well as the tips given in these reviews. Even my husband the Electrical Engineer couldn't get it to work. The lights will occasionally come on and a slight distortion in the magnifying side didn't bother me. I could see well when it worked. I should have returned it but was ill at the time. I don't advise buying this mirror. You may get one of the ""bad ones""."
1,Poorly designed,"Definitely would NOT recommend this mirror. The slide at the bottom to change the lighting selections (office, daylight, etc) is very poorly designed. It did not want to slide. I did finally get it to slide to the right, but then it wouldn't slide back to the left; it was permanently stuck. I boxed it up & returned it the same day I received it."
5,Jerdon Classic Lighted Tri-fold Mirror,I recommend this mirror. It is a good value. The tri-fold mirror allows for excellent view. The options for lighting make the mirror versatile. I bought it as a surprise gift and the recipient was delighted.
3,nothing special,"This is a decent mirror. It is not very bright, I thought it would be really bright and it is not. I really think I would have preferred a mirror without the two side mirrors. I do not even use them and they kind of get in they way. I do like the magnified mirror, but you have to be an inch from it for you to be able to see yourself. I wish it would hae been brighter. You do have to hold the button down for the mirror to light, but I have had no problem lighting it up."
1,Disappointed...the light isn't working!,"I've only had this light for six months. I wasn't crazy about the light it gave off, but it was sufficient. I was putting my makeup on today, and the darn thing started to flicker. I turned the light off, and turned it back on, and nothing. I did that a few times, and the light managed to come on for a few flickering seconds, just to go off again. I asked my husband to look at it and he informed me of the warning on the back not to open it as there are no serviceable parts inside. Oh brother, I expected this light to last for several years. There is nothing I can do to fix it, so in the trash it will go. The majority of the reviews were good, so I took a chance. I'm really disappointed!"
4,Great Lighted Mirror,"This mirror is a nice mirror. The light is so much brighter than the subdued lighting of the smaller versions in the stores. The price on Amazon was almost $10.00 dollars cheaper than the same model mirror solded in other retail stores. When I first turned on the light the left side flickered for a while. After several uses it has stopped. As long as they keep making these mirrors, when the need arises (which is usually every 5 years or so)I will buy the same model."
3,Disappointed,"My husband bought this for me as a Christmas gift, Paid 4 maybe 5 dollar extra for the next day delivery. It was never here. Extremely disappointed, The item itself is beautiful Just like I always wanted. Just wish It was here when we paid for it to be"
1,Junk,"Purchased, received, unpacked, turned on. That's where things started to go downhill. I slid the little light changing tab across and it snapped off, flew out of my hand and onto the floor where one of my cats thought it was the best little toy I had ever bought her. After wrestling the small piece of plastic away from the cat, I reattached it to the little metal piece that ""held it"" (obviously, I use that term loosely). The lights were stuck on part pink (daytime??) and part green (martian time?) and wouldn't budge. Packed it back up and shipped it back. Good times."
1,Early failure. Impossible to replace bulbs.,"This product has 2 florescent light bulbs, which one would not expect to last forever. Having said that, one would also expect to be able to replace them. Impossible without destroying the case, which cannot be opened. Was used about 4 times per week for ten minutes or so per day. Bulbs lasted about a year. Fair enough. Now have to throw the unit away, being unable ( by design) To replace them. Strongly advise that you purchase some other lighted mirror. Very disappointed."
2,Wel....,"I like the mirror except that the slides are not the same. When I have 'Day' selected it is half green and half pink on one side and half purple and pink on the the other. I wish I could contact the seller, I would like to exchange my mirror, I really do like it. I may return it; I've only had it since the day before Chrismas."
1,Don't Waste Your Money!!!,"I read the reviews for this item but bought it anyway. Big mistake!! The light worked fine for about a month, then I had trouble turning it on. It would take 3 - 5 minutes to get both bulbs to light so it would stay on. I have now had this mirror 4 months and it won't light. Since it has a 1 year warranty, I tried calling the customer service number to return it. Guess what - THE NUMBER WAS DISCONNECTED!! So the 1 year warranty is worthless. I ended up buying a new mirror at Walmart. DON'T BUY THIS MIRROR!!"
3,Just ok...,I think if the mirror was a little bigger and the lights a little farther on the sides this would be much better... You have to have your face right up as close as you can get it to see anything right....It's just ok....Nothing special....
2,Light flickers VERY badly,"The magnification is good, the adjustible height is good, but the lighting on this is horrible. Every setting flickers the entire time it's on, which makes it very difficult to see. I would not recommend this product."
1,Disappointed...,"Great while it worked. I bought this on December 17, 2010, and it stopped working on December 5, 2011. I don't use it every day, so not even a year's use out of it. I don't like buying things that don't last, or can't be repaired. One reviewer mentioned that the cost makes it disposable. I think that is just sad. I won't buy this again."
1,Took a chance...so wrong,"After searching for a replacement for my dead Revlon lighted magnifying mirror, I read all your reviews listed for this product. I thought armed with the information from several users about holding the ""on"" button a few seconds to get the lights to come on, I would be fine with it. Ok, so it worked the first 3 times. Now it tries to light up one light, but not the other, or absolutely nothing. I try holding the switch down and allow the lights to ""flicker"", but not no sparks! And it always happens when I am trying to get ready to go out and want to see my face.I no longer have the packaging, but I am going to return this product for another. Such a disappointment, and now a hassle as well."
2,So-so product,5X magnification required mirror to be too close to my wife's face to be of use to her. Lighting was not as bright as expected.
4,rating of te jerdon lighted mirror,my daughter loved it. she spends countless ours in front ofit. it keeps her out of my room. thank you.
1,terrible,This is a terrible product. The lights are not bright enough. Bulky and awkward to store.The only reason I gave it a 1 is there is no 0 star.
2,More Light,"Please does anyone make a make-up mirror with enough lite, this one was the same, dim lighting. I had to send it back and keep looking."
3,Meh....Good Enough,"Why is it that you just cannot find 'good' makeup mirrors that are pretty? This one functions fine - the lights are bright and the magnification is adequate. The issue is that this mirror is just NOT PRETTY. I have a beautiful antique vanity and this looks dumb sitting on it.The mirror is bright white plastic. Plastic. I am keeping it because it does work, I am just unhappy with the way it looks."
2,Product is only as good as the bulbs,"When I first bought this mirror, I thought it was great. The lighting and magnification met my needs perfectly. I had no issues with this mirror until about 3 months later, the bulbs went out. At first I thought its no big deal, I'll just replace the bulbs. Then I realized, it's impossible to get to the bulbs without taking the mirror apart. Once I could get to the bulb, I realized there's no way to get it out without breaking the mirror. So I ended up throwing the whole mirror in the trash."
1,Pass.,"In this run of The Avengers, Johns has to follow one of the greatest runs ever by Kurt Busiek. Needless to say this entire series falls flat."
2,The search for She-Hulk,"Okay, i admit i havent actually read this book but i have read the comics that are reprinted in it, the story is great, Geoff Johns links all the charecters together and they all play a part, the avengers is a big team and not many writers can juggle all of them in one story, Sott Kolins art is great, but not many people like it and you might not either, then again thats may opinion.overall scale: 2 stars"
5,Great concert!,"Back in the sixties and seventies a record label called Pickwick had ownership of Capitol Records recordings. The minor label released a handful of albums containing previously released recordings by the Beach Boys and other artists who recorded on Capitol. One of the Pickwick albums was entitled WOW! GREAT CONCERT. Nine songs from this live performance were used for that set. They are FUN FUN FUN,LITTLE DEUCE COUPE,LONG TALL TEXAN,IN MY ROOM,THE MONSTER MASH(a Halloween favorite),PA PA MOW MOW,THE LITTLE OLD LADY FROM PASADENA(made famous by Jan & Dean),GRADUATION DAY and I GET AROUND. The other four songs are totally awesome. Hey,this was 1963 or '64 when Beach Boymania was spreading like wildfire all over America just like Beatlemania but in England before America. The Beach Boys were worshipped by young British girls as well just like the Beatles. Also in those years,both bands were gracing covers of 16 magazine."
2,Wrong choice for me.,"I bought this for my wife (she asked for) after extensive research and looking at reviews...looks good on paper but she doesnt like it at all...The dryer isnt that powerful and was compared to my daughters $40 dryer, doesnt seem to do any better, plus hers has way more air flow. Heat is 1875 vs 1575 (the Bio). The flat iron doesnt work near as good as the Chi from target..as from what I can see ,the flat parts dont mesh well, so the top portion hits first, then there is a gap so it isnt even. Daughters doesnt do that and is smooth. Wish I didnt purchase as now I am stuck with it and no one likes it...moral of the story...women should buy their own hair stuff! Very disappointed. Tried but failed.I would like to add that it appears to be very well built though but just wasnt right for us."
4,Archaeological Study Bible,This is an amazing Study Bible. It gives you alot of the history of what was going on then. The only thing that I didn't like was that it did not come with the cd.I would love to get the cd that goes with this Bible.
5,Great!,"This book was better than I thought it was going to be. I did not think it would have study notes for the verses, too. Lots of great information here; lots of proof for the validity of the bible and also notes on culture at the time it was written through out each chapter."
5,It's all Here!,"I love history, archeology and the BIble. THey're all together here and with a lot of ""factoids"" that I'd been wondering about."
4,Archaeological Study Bible,This is a most facinating Bible. It becomes difficult reading ONLY because of the smaller print. I would dearly love to have a copy of this bible in slightly larger print.
2,Small-Print Bible,"I'm very sorry I purchased this ""Archaeological Bible"". It's very interesting to look at, but impossible to read -- at least, for me. The type is quite small, and my 66-year-old eyes can't handle it. I can understand the reason they did this; with all the sidebars and footnotes, the thing would have been a foot thick in normal-size print. But what's the use in having all this information if you can't read it? I've given up and gone back to my Oxford Annotated Study Bible for my studies."
3,Fuzzy reception- need post sound program to fix,"So the kit IS really easy to use, and it has a good sticker price, but that comes at a slight cost, as you would expect. The demos of this thing online were by youtubers who, I found out later, cleaned up the audio in post (thanks guys, really helpful product demo). So I was a bit mislead into buying this. But if you don't mind a little post work in audacity, soundtrack pro, etc. this may be what you are looking for when it comes to a cheap, wireless solution. After the sound is cleaned up it sounds pretty decent. I got reception through walls, etc. The problem was that it was just fuzzy in the background no matter what distance that transmitter was from the receiver, and I tried both frequencies. Know what you are getting when you buy this product, a cheap solution to a wireless system... I would only recommend this kit with a good program to fix the hiss, like soundtrack pro. Good luck!"
1,"Great Package, Poor Results","I ordered and unboxed teh item and tried it on the first day it was received. There was immediate interference when testing the unit in the comfort of my home. I mived to two ther rooms and the interference was just as bad. In hopes that it was only inteference from my headphones, I uploaded the footage to the computer and noticed that it made the footage unuseable. The idea behind this product at its great pricepoint is great but I will stick to UHF models from here on out. You get what you pay for."
5,Excellent Seller!,"The book was exactly as I expected it to be, and the shipping was relatively quick as well. Good book without the syrup/sludge of the Jacob vs. Edward series."
3,"Inexpensive not great quality. But, works for us.","My granddaughter just loves it. It's not the best quality but the price is right. And, at 4yrs old - not bound to last anyway. It's perfect for her now."
4,ballerina jewelry box,My grand daughter loves this musical jewelry box! I was disappointed that the tune is not the same as the one her Mommy had when she was little. But it is very pretty -- the irridescence makes it perfectly beautiful to a little girl!
5,great jewerly box for small ones,this is a great jewerly box for small ones. I bought it for my 4 year old grand daughter and she loves it.
3,cute but flimsy,"Came to me with ballerina in pieces and rattling around the box, then when opened smelled strongly of mildew. I had to glue the ballerina together and spray it with perfume and air it out. I would have sent it back if it weren't so close to Christmas."
5,Perfect gift for a little girl,"I bought this for my daughters 4th birthday.The outside of the box isvery beautiful. The inside is what you would expect from a childs jewelry box-but does not look cheap or flimsy.Overall the product seems sturdy and well made.The ballerina doll spins fine and the music box has great sound. I was surprised actually how clear it was.The ballerina is painted plastic and an adult might not be impressed by the paint job but it is more than beautiful enough for a little girl-this IS,after all a childs music box. With room for probably 3 or 4 little girl necklaces.Mine came with a very small nick in it but i still give it 5 stars. It's a beautiful little gift for anylittle girl."
4,Very Beautiful!,"My 5-yr.old granddaughter loves this very pretty music box. It does need special care because it can break easy but she is very careful not to be to rough with it. The music it plays, and the dancing ballerina is a real plus! She puts her favorite jewelry inside of it. It is a very reasonable price for what you get because it really is a beautiful little box."
1,Day Date Wall Clock,"The clock was poorly made. The day and date did not line up - an issue with bad design, not this particular clock.The dealer and Amazon handled the return extremely well with no problems. Amazon once again shows why they are number 1.The dealer that sold the clock was very helpful and allowed me to return the clock. Five stars to both the dealer and Amazon."
5,moving performance,"I bought this cd out of curiosity.I had never heared of wiedemann before.Very good interpretation of this contemporary repertory.The best interpretation of ""libra sonatine"" I've ever heared..."
3,Good To Keep your partner happy,"if you want to keep your partner happy and she likes cowboys this is the perfect present it also has a lot of information about the stars in it, if you can stop her from drooling and listen aswell as watching"
4,Such an enjoyable work!,"I listened to this with my husband and 7 year old daughter while driving to and from the cottage this summer. We enjoyed the shared experience. The 7 year old understood what was going on and looked forward to the next installment each week!A translation that makes the story approachable...and Ian does a superb job of reading, making slight changes in intonation and tone to help the listener understand when different characters speak."
4,Odysseus brought to life.,"It was with great dread that I purchased the audio tapes of the Odyssey. It is with great pleasure that I write this review. Audio turned a dreaded assignment into a wonderful experience.The odyssey is a story to be listened to and not read. Ian McKellen's voice transends the here and now, transporting you back in time. It's as if you are seated around a fire listening to the tale for the first time."
3,A lesser Laymon Work,"This is more of a novella than a novel. It's quite short. But it's fast paced and suspenseful. The opening sequence is fantastic. Really creepy. This one never lets up for a single page. I don't want to go into the plot and give anything away, but I'll say it's got a couple nice twists, a few good scares, and like usual in Laymon's work, very twisted bad guys. It's definitely not one of his best, but worth a read. If you are a Laymon fan, or just a fan of horror or mystery/suspense thrillers, I recommend."
2,Not one of Laymon's best.,"I was kind of dissappointed by this novel. Like someone posted earlier, this book feels rushed and a lot of things are not explained and the end."
3,Fans will like it - 3.5 stars,"This isn't one of Richard Laymon's best books. The ending seemed a bit rushed and a little slapped together. However, you can't go wrong with Laymon. He always gives you a taste of the hardcore, and Allhallow's Eve is a fun, easy, bloody read.Fans of his work will not be disappointed.James Roy Daley, author of THE DEAD PARADEThe Dead Parade"
4,"Charming, buoyant, illuminating","This disc is a marvelous opportunity to hear Jerome Kern getting his feet wet in the musical game. I would particularly recommend the song ""Take Care"" as one of the collection's highlights, combining a delightful melody and an excellent vocal performance by Ms. Sciolla. Perhaps if fewer songs had been included overall, the better numbers like ""Take Care"" would stand out even more. In any case, this was a project well worth doing, and I would love to hear some other performers pick up some of these songs. There is one mystery, however: Who is this Billie Burke who is credited as vocalist on two numbers? Surely not the star of early film musicals, who died in 1970?"
2,On Balance: Boring,"Historical, musical curiousities. Rather dated in style but with some premonition of the musical masterpieces to come later. Would have been much more interesting with more singers performing. As it is, one gets the impression of the same song being sung over and over."
1,Opportunist,It is the lowest to release these tapes without permission. I will not read this book or anything this guy will ever do. What goes around comes around and this guy will die painfully and penniless. It is not surprising that self serving slime like this crawls from under their rocks once in a while. I would feel the same if someone released this on Clinton...other than the Linda Tripp stuff. That was pure slime and needed to be recorded and exposed. This was just a casual conversation with a friend and the dufus recorded it. There is no respect for the President. This tape just creates fodder for folks with no life. What does Weak...I mean Wead have for a legacy....a real patriot.
1,Interesting...,"I find it hilarious that we seem to be more outraged over back-stabbing former friends than the actual act of using cocaine. If Jose Canseco wrote this book, would people start investigating past behavior more?"
3,Undecided,I haven't done any kind of experiment with the flax seed oil capsules to know if they are giving me benefits. But I did recently read an article in my diabetic magazine saying they were doing an experiment with flax seed (ground up) so I'm waiting for the results. Flax seed was recommend to me by a doctor so I've been taking it for about a month now (twice a day) so hopefully it is giving me some benefit.
4,Great Book!,"I am a culinary student who is working in the industry. Being in culinary school also requires management courses other than cooking classes so any helpful textbook that relates to the real world helps. I am not that great with math and this book breaks down profit and loss statements. (Formulas and all) It reads like a text book because well, it's a text book! (It's easy to follow) I definitely plan on using the book as a reference as a future manager/owner in the industry."
5,An Awesome Book of Never Ending Information!,"As a 12 year old first time science fair competitor, I was happy to achieve 1st place! My topic and information was taken from Mr.Frank DeFreitas' book. This book got me through the hard times of the project. It was so easy to navigate through the book, that I could find how to fix my problems immediately. The Shoe Box Holography Method was very easy to use but at the same time exerted a good amount of challenge. It gave the basic fundamental priciples of making a hologram, and showed me a piece of the future which is not far away! After doing this project, I instantly wanted to know more, and by looking deeper into the book, I came across more advanced projects! I don't think I will outgrow this book for a while. It's information goes on forever! Lastly, I recommend this book for someone who wants an awesome science fair topic, a piece of the future, or to discover an exciting hobby!THANK YOU MR.FRANK DEFREITAS !"
3,You get what you pay for,"The picture looks a lot better than the real thing, you get what you pay for but they do the job."
1,Useless,"Awful, awful, awful. If I could give them zero stars, I would. The very first time I tried to remove food from one, it broke. I twisted it, as you do with ice cube trays, and it snapped right in two. I wasn't even twisting very hard. The plastic is just way too hard for this purpose. I went out to Bed, Bath and Beyond and bought some covered ice cube trays that have eight cubes all in a single row, and they're fantastic. They're much more flexible and take up half the room for the same number of cubes. They were only $2.99 each. These Kidco trays are bulky and brittle and not worth the money. Avoid them at all cost!"
4,Outstanding country gospel from a well-known ne'er-do-well,"Johnny Paycheck was well-known as a roughneck and a rowdy, but despite his reputation as a party animal, he sure sang some sweet gospel music. This generously programmed CD gathers together all of his religious recordings for the independent Little Darlin' label, including material from two albums, 1967's ""Gospeltime In My Fashion"" and a later set recorded in the late '70s, when Paycheck had made it into the bigtime, and was quickly watching his star fall out of the Nashville firmament. All of it is top-flight country gospel material, more heartfelt and sincere than many of his secular recordings... If you like either inspirational music or hard-country honkytonk, this disc is definitely worth checking out."
3,Salsa Legend's Biopic,"Watching ""El Cantante"" is my 1st experience at learning anything about Salsa superstar Hector Lavoe.... I'd never heard his name before or even any of his songs, so looked forward to watching this movie.""El Cantante"" covers Lavoe's adult life from his rise to fame & his success as a singer though the point of view of his wife, Puchi. I think the acting, screenplay, music, and cinematography were all excellent. The only major complaint about this movies was how TERRIBLY SLOW it was, which surprised me."
2,"This is really Puchi's story.Music great,Lopez great,movie a mess","If this film was about the great salsa singer Hector Lavoe, then it would have been better served if Jennifer Lopez would have played the role instead of husband Marc Anthony!If John Travolta can play Edna Turnblad in ""Hairspray"" then Lopez could have pulled off Lavoe! Seriously, this is one confusing film that is so over edited that one could get seizures from all of the back and forth cuts! If anything is good about ""El Cantante"" (The Singer) it is Lopez as Puchi Lavoe.An excellent performance,though, cannot justify this film's credibility.It is long and over styled like salsa with too much pepper.Jennifer may just get an Oscar nod here, but if I could edit out her husband I would!"
2,"Love the movie, however, Bad product! Get what you pay for!","Lovely movie!!! However, I understand this was cheap but I still expected better quality than a cheap DVD that seemed worse than a boot-leg! The movie would stop and have a black screen every 30 minutes. Will not buy from this seller again."
1,What a poorly made movie...,"Although Mark Anthony's singing was superb, his acting was horrible. I found the dialogue, directing, and cinematography almost amateur. Like many entertainers Hector Lavoe was self-destructive and the movie conveyed that. Unfortunately, that's all you walked away with. Instead of endearing you to the man, his talent, and contribution to music you got more and more turned off by him as the movie progressed.This could have been such a better movie about an amazing talent and time in Latin music."
5,Excellent book,A very enjoyable read with lots of good information about many hard-to-find animal species. I would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in wildlife and habitat conservation issues.
4,listen up,"This is a great book... easy to read, info that is easy to implement, and it gets you thinking. The coach said read it so I did. Time to put it to work."
3,Ok,It Was Pretty Good And The Lips Where ok But Kinda Fell Apart When I Took Them Out But The Mold Looked Great
2,"No sir, I didn't like it","I bought this cartridge to replace a cartridge in a used Technics turntable I bought. Turns out I should have looked harder for a new stylus for THAT cartridge, as this one I put in worked more poorly than the one that was already on the turntable (a higher-level gold Audio-Technica P-Mount cartridge). The record stuck, which hadn't happened before. Also, the sound quality, even with a fresh stylus, didn't match what was already on the turntable. Had the new cartridge off and packaged to send back to Amazon.com within 1/2 hour. Amazon was gracious about returning my $$ for this purchase. Thanks, Amazon."
5,phono cartridge saves the day,"I've been wanting to transfer special lp's but was unable tofor lack of the specific cartridge for my old turntable.Thank you for having the connection available so that Imay do so, especially children's lp's for my granddaughter(Captain Kangaroo, Peter and the Wolf; Dennis Day, JohnnyAppleseed; Danny Kaye, The Little Fiddle). What fun timesmy granddaughter and I have to enjoy."
3,Beware non p-mount turntables,"This A/T cartridge is pretty good for the money, but if you use the 1/2"" adapter the angle of the cartridge and stylus is wrong. This places the bottom of the needle to close to the record surface as stated in past reviews even at the lightest tracking weight of 1 gram. I would suggest the Shure M92 Cart, it's high compliance stylus is a better match to 1/2"" tone arms.Shure M92E Hi-Fi Moving Magnet Cartridge"
3,Good But Incomplete,"This book is a great volume for a layperson, with little or no construction experience, interested in straw bale building and other construction topics. For someone like myself, with modest building experience, ready to build a straw bale house, Straw Bale Building doesn't have enough detail. The authors spend too much space discussing general building considerations--mechanical systems, roofing styles, working with architects, etc.--taking up space that could be devoted to more straw bale-specific details like flashing, roofing detailing, and more. I like their eco-friendly bent, and there are some interesting (but brief) case studies. If you're new to construction and straw bales, this is a good starter book. However, it doesn't have enough information to get you to a finished building unless you do a lot of reading between the lines and puzzling out details."
4,Strawbale construction 101,"This is an excellent book for anyone interested in strawbale construction, whether you are just getting interested in the subject, or have been researching every source you can find. I happen to fall into the last group. This book assumes no prior knowledge of strawbale construction methods, yet has something to offer even the more well read strawbale enthusiast. Recommended."
5,"Benefiber, Fiber Supplement","The French certainly know their chemistry. Once again they have produced an incredible health product. Benefiber helps your body achieve the necessary amount of daily fiber to keep the digestive tract working properly, and it dissolves quickly has no taste too boot. It is also sugar free, which for many people is important.My boyfriend suggested this product to me, because someone told him how good it is, and I decided to take a chance and try it. That was about a year ago, and I have never felt better since using this product regularly.There is a problem however, for me to continue buying Benefiber through Amazon.com. I have found this same exact product in the same size 25.6 oz at a local store for $9.00 less than I have been buying it on Amazon.com, and as long as I am able to purchase Benefiber at the lesser price, I will no longer be pruchasing this product from your store.M.LaMonteTampa, FL"
3,"Works, but not pretty","The picture doesn't fully expose how the dull grey would look. Kind of an eyesore against a black monitor and speakers. But serves it purpose well, raising the monitor 4 inches and holds my 22 inch widescreen monitor just fine"
3,color on website is misleading,works well but don't expect it to be silver/chrome as the photo shows. It really is more like a dull beige. They should change the picture. I bought it to match my metal desk and it is wrong color.
5,Allsop 27021 Metal Art Jr Monitor Stand (Pewter),Great little stand. I use for my external hard drives to allow heat to dissipate. I also used for my PS3 to avoid overheating.
1,Terrible,"I got this product there were scuffs, dings in the metal and even a cap that covers the bottom foot was missing. Do not get. Just go to a local store and get one that you know is reliable."
1,Absolutely Disgusted,"I don't understand what's going on with Amazon, I'm almost ready to kill my account. This item arrived late (3-days on a 2-day prime purchase) and damaged. The shipping container was fine, even the item box was okay, but on one end of the stand, the paint is chipped, missing, and the metal is rusted. The damage is pretty severe. The paint is damaged, scratched and problematic all over, but is really bad on the one end. Yes it hold up my monitor, but it looks horrible. I looked for an easy way to contact Amazon and make arrangements, but of course there is none. Hopefully someone there will read this review and respond. It's the only thing I can think of.As far as the item goes, my company bought a bunch of these, and they've been great. Obviously they didn't get them from Amazon because all of them from the office are perfect. It's too bad really, because it should be a great product. In the end I feel completely ripped off. Thanks Amazon! You're the best!"
3,color is not what they said,"I do like the design of the monitor holder. It lifts my large monitor to eye level keeping my back in better alignment, BUT... the color is definitely not pewter but more a khaki green which I do not care for.I should have paid more and gone with the black, but I wanted the printer stand by ALLSOP also and it is the same khaki color. This is just for use on my desk while I am in school, so I will live with it, but wouldn't order it again based on the color."
5,It's a cutting board.,"I can cut things on it. It's the size I expected. It doesn't break, doesn't smell bad, isn't haunted, etc.What else can you say about a cutting board? It's good. Five stars."
2,awful,"I was actually disappointed when this arrived - it is the exact same brand and material as the one I'm getting rid of because it was so scratched and stained - so I'm really hoping this one won't scratch and stain like the other - but just have to wait and see - it is a good size - guess I'll see how it holds up and then might change star ratingupdate 12/18/12 - I hate this board - it stains, scratches, does not grip sink, so slips around - I have scrubbed and scrubbed it and can't get rid of stains"
1,another orientalist disaster,another failed piece about South Asia by a known orientalist scholar. If you like being in a fantasy world then this book is for you.
5,Great Mirror,"This mirror looks great in my bathroom. The finish matches my brushed nickel fixtures. I was able to screw it right into a stud, so I didn't have any problems hanging it. It probably took me all of 5 minutes to install including getting all my tools into my bathroom. Now I can see to put on makeup!"
4,"Attractive, affordable, bronze swing-arm mirror",We had to have a way to get close enough to the mirror to insert contact lenses in our new home that was built for people a foot taller than we are. I found this mirror on Amazon and it was significantly less expensive than similar items from other companies. Quality is adequate for my needs - only the half-circle of metal to which the mirror is mounted appears to be somewhat thin. Overall seems like a sturdy item. Attractive and easy to mount. I would purchase this item again.
5,great mirror,I have had this for about 4 months in a bathroom that gets long hot showers and it shows no signs of tarnish or rust. It is so nice that I bought a second one for the other bathroom.
5,Great Mirror!,I was happy to find this mirror to install in my bathroom so I could see the back of my hair. I love the design and it works really well.
5,Good Wall Mirror,"The wall mirror works as advertised. Easy to assemble, it has great magnification, it not only looks good but works good, too."
1,wall mirror,Didn't get to hang it cause the mirrow came off the base and we had thrown the box away so couldnt return it
2,OK mirror,"nice mirror, but one of the bolts that holds teh mirror around its rotating axis broke after 3 months of usage"
3,Generally good,Well crafted except for one thing I have noticed so far: The caps/nuts on the screws on which the mirror flips/rotates are prone to come undone and fall off. I can scarcely turn from the normal to the magnified side without one or the other of the caps coming loose.
5,Just what the doctor ordered!,I pondered over this purchase and glad I decided to buy it. I love it!
1,hate me all you want.,"I don't care if a true masterpiece like ""Sgt. Pepper's"" was inspired by this album. What we have here is GOOEY PAP. ""Wouldn't It Be Nice"" does qualify as a ""nice"" single, though not as enjoyable as ""California Girls"" or ""Get Around."" The rest is pretty much a drag that I can't bear to listen to. Obviously, I am not a fan of this band, but they did put out some key music that made 'California dreamy' and had a big impact on the sixties. I am, however, a big fan of the Beatles and when I read a while back that this album influenced them, I just couldn't believe it when I finally heard it. I don't know why anyone would sit around and listen to ""Pet Sounds."" It sounds much more like easy listening than rock n' roll. The innovative aspects to its recording are over-rated or at least suffer greatly from the passage of time. If someone wanted to torture me, tying me up and making me listen to this album would be an effective method."
2,A Limited Viewpoint,"I read this book some 5 years ago, and while it did provide some basic information, it also had a quite limited view of the phenomenon of satanism in general. The book's limitations stem from its Christian viewpoint and its inherent dualism, along with its emphasis on ""opposing"" the Satanism. Such a stance omits a considerably broader and more psychological approach, which explores Satanism as a reaction to extremely repressive and rigid version of Christianity, and the creation of deities as a projection of some human quality onto the divine. For therapists, in particular, it is important to ally with all the parts of the human, not just the ""good"" or benign parts, in order to facilitate the healing process. Such a viewpoint permits a therapist to ""reframe"" the ""evil"" or ""Satanic"" parts of the individual as contributing to the person's survival of an inescapable trauma. For therapists working with survivors of Satanic ritual abuse, Colin Ross's book is vastly superior."
5,Stormbreaker,"A fourteen year old teenager named Alex Rider is in big trouble! This book has plenty of slam, bang, cation, spying, and high tech gadgets that make this book awesome. Stormbreaker is a non-stop thriller with action packed chapters that will blow your mind. Anthony Horowitz balances Alex Rider`s super spy action with typical teen dangers that make Alex a loveable hero. On the second to last page of the book the quote ""He didn`t leave a name"". This quote it means that when the person who gave Alex money after all his dangerous missions Alex was clueless to who gave it to him because they mailed the money to him. This book is for kids in the grades 4-9 and hope you have a good read!"
3,Alex Rider 1,"Rate: 3.5I've been hooked with spy novel as of late; Anna Campbell, Evelyn Salt, Annie Walker or Chuck Bartowski might have slight influence on the whole thing but I am just generally fascinated with the whole espionage business. The mystery, danger and drama of it all provides great entertainment. Young Alex Rider here is no exception, in fact he is completely awesome, i still cannot get over that whole fiasco on that metal grinder. I keep thinking this could not be happening, maybe I am missing something and Alex is actually a cyborg or a half breed of something but no, it was all teenager with great spy skills passed down by his uncle without him knowing it. Agood start of a great series. Can't wait to read book 2."
5,Stormbreaker,This book I thaught was one best books I have ever read. It has everthing in it. It has action adventure and comedy. This book is about a boy named Alex Rider whose uncle was mysteriously killed in a car crash or so they thaught. Alex so finds out the truth and is turned into a secert angent for an angcie known as M16. Alex findds himself in the same places as his uncle was but know his uncle is dead and Alex must find out what is going on with the stormbreaker computer. You find yourself so into the book that you what to just keep reading even when you are supposed to do other things I was very happy with the book I would highly recommed it to everyone.
5,a stork of a story l.,"wow. that was my first alex rider book and i must admit i finishedit the same day i bought this. great adventures however books are never perfect. one of the flaws for this book would be. well for me, that it didnt seem realistic. but really, you dont notice it when your reading unless you think it over pondering7 like me. haha. i would recomend this book."
4,Alex Rider bt Anthony Horowitz,"Way better than the movie and that was good. The introduction was great, Alex does not seem to want to be a spy, he is blackmailed into it. The story is great, the characters are easy to follow, I only gave it 4 stars because I think many of the ideas are copied from James Bonds films. They have a guy just like'Q' who gives you gadgets, although this guy is very fat, the car shoots guns ect.The rest of the series is just as good, I am now looking forward to getting Book 8 Crododile Tears."
5,Really GooD!,"This is the best mic! It is a good shape, easy to use, simple, small, good quality and perfect for any home mic use! I LOVE mine!"
3,Radio Shack's microphone is better ...,"I was hoping to save a few $$$ by buying this microphone, but now regret my decision. If you want a very good quality omni-directional microphone, I suggest you look into Radio Shack's product."
1,Disappointed,THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I'VE BEEN DISAPPOINTED WITH AN INK ORDER. THIS ONE SENT ME A 26 AND A 17 INSTEAD OF WHAT I ORDERED ALSO THE COLOR CARTRIDGE IS THE PITS. I PRINT A LOT OF PHOTOS AND THESE CARTRIDGES ARE OF VERY POOR QUALITY.
1,"No deal, it's Unreal...","This disclaimor before the intro to photos from this book posted on Nerve.com sort of says it all:""This introduction was written before it became known that Mark Helfrich's subjects were not actually his ex-girlfriends, but rather, models posing as his ex-girlfriends.""The book loses any meaning when you know it's all been staged because the conception of the photographs was the intimacy they were supposed to represent. Consequently when one knows it's a fraud, one realizes why the sentiments of the text Helferich writes for each ""girlfriend"" and the images seem so out of joint."
4,Beware of the picture-missing quick disconnect.,"I ordered the spray nozzle, and when it arrived it was missing the stainless-steel quick disconnect. The base of the nozzle is threaded and it had a brass threated insert. Being a Tool Maker, I made a quick disconnect for the nozzle (1.5mm pitch). My unit is 9HP; 3100 psi, and I'm presently waiting for the hose reel I ordered before I try out this nozzle. As shipped, this nozzle would permanently screw onto the end of the wand. The interior parts @ nozzle discharge are ceramic. Becareful of slamming this into a hard object."
2,Not what I was looking for,"I first became in love with the idea of waterproofing my shoes, pants ect. when I went to the store Shi by Journeys. They had this wonderful spray that made water just bead off of the shoe. I was looking for that exact same product on amazon because 1. I'm lazy and I don't feel like driving back to the store and 2. I know I'll find another pare of shoes to buy that I don't need. Anyway the spray that I bought at Shi was... a spray. This isn't. It's something you have to scrub on your shoes and in my opinion it's too much effort. If you are looking to not put much labor into waterproofing your beloved shoes then go with a spray. I'm still on the hunt for a good waterproofing spray product that won't lead me to another shoe impulse buy :)"
2,Ruined my suede Clarks,"I bought these for my Clarks Bushacre brown suede and applied it as instructed. After applying the gel; it created a sort of waxy look on the suede and somewhat harden the suede texture. Now it gleams in certain spots in the sun since it's impossible to apply evenly. Another problem is that it drastically changes the color of the suede. I applied it to both the brown suede Bushacres and a little bit on my Clarks Jink chestnut and it darkens it, by a lot! I wouldn't recommend since it affects with what the original is supposed to look like."
3,Works Okay but...,Tried both products and was happy with the cleaner but the waterproofsealant made my beautiful light tan nubuck leather work-boots dark brown and kind of discolored looking.And YES I followed the directions to the letter! So now one boot is darker than the other and my wife saysshe's embarrassed to go out with me if I wear them! (not sure if she meant it) Anyway the sealant works OK excepton the edges where the boot creases. The water saturates those little creases. Don't think I'll buy this againand still searching for a nubuck cleaning/waterproofing product that doesn't change the color so drastically.
3,"Adequate fuzzy dice, quality is questionable.","There is very little to talk about in regards to these fuzzy dice, minus the construction. Rather having the dots sewed on, they're glued on. One already has fallen off. Otherwise, the product is fine."
4,Good introduction into beekeeping,I purchased this book AFTER a friend gave me a hive and a new package of bees. I found Book of Bees to be an easy enjoyable read. It's not a how to of beekeeping but it does open ones eyes to what can be involved in beekeeping and how much there is to learn about bees and their environment. The book provides a good introduction into beekeeping without going overboard into technical details that might spook a newbie beekeeper away.
1,Just poor,"The nice painting on the front is simply the best in the book.Many of the examples look a novice did them. The publisheris at fault for a true "" bait and switch"" on this so-called handbook."
1,More feel-good fantasies...,"No matter how many experiments are made that disproof the Mozart Effect there will always be parents who want a fast easy way of controlling or making their kids more ""intelligent"". Someday someone is going to market a sugar pill to do that, and make millions.It's the fast-food approach to life. And you as a parent are going to lose for it.The old fashion way, giving of your time and caring by sharing and personally teaching is no longer in vogue."
3,Nice but couldn't use it,Real nice mirror but... unfortunately the on/off switch is cheap and on the cord.I had to return because it couldn't be used on Wife's vanity without leaving cord outon top of vanity. Needed one with turn on/off switch on mount.
2,makeup mirror with light,"I needed a lighting mirror because of the way the sunlight is cast through the bathroom window, but the light on this mirror was ineffective. It wasn't bright enough to light shaded areas of my face when I applied makeup."
1,Wanted to break the disk and use it to poke my eyes out,"Tried to watch this as we had NOTHING else to watch. Whoever gave it a five star review must have been in the movie and trying to bump up ratings. My son could do better graphics with an etch-a-sketch. Take 2 dollar bills, burn them and you will have more entertainment."
5,Makes Atheist Squirm,"It would be very difficult to refute the claims established in this book. In fact, if one did, one would be placing his or her credibility on the line."
4,Turntable,I just got this turntable for Christmas and so far it works very well. I hooked it up to my receiver and have been listening to my records all morning. The sound quality is great and it is very easy to set up and use. I gave it 4 stars because it is kind of cheap compared to some of the other turntables out there for the same price. (p.s.--Mine didn't come with a record mat so I had to use an old one. This might just be mine because it tells you what do do with the record mat so it must come with one.)Enjoy.
4,Whoopie!!!,"What a great turntable!! Had a yard sale recently and almost sold some of my best albums. The reason, my old turntable was broken. So, I decided to search the web for either a used one or something that would satisfy me. Well, this Audio-Technica was the answer. If you're looking for a basic turntable you can't go wrong with this one. It does come with the capability to hook up other devices. The price was right and would recommend this product."
2,Auidio Technica AT-PL50 Turntable,This record player looks and runs good except for one flaw. The needle head doesn't have enough weight to it so some of my records makes the needle bounce uncontrollably. I had to tape a nickel to it. I would suggest a turntable with a little better quality if you plan on playing records regularly. Otherwise a good bang for the buck.
4,AT turntable,"Just got mine and I am listening to music I haven't heard in about 10 years, it is great! My wife's records aren't doing as well but they were played on cheap phono's with heavy cartridges and stored wihout sleeves."
4,Nice for folks like me.,"I am a huge colletor of music, but i am in the Cassette Generation, and have a ton of those (around 600). I Also have upwards and likely over of 3000 cd's. I have quite a few vinyl albums that are in good condition (around 100), so skipping is not an issue. This little turntable is all I need, reliable, and a good value. I have actually purchased two of them, one for me and one for my brother. I have had the older of the two players for over 6 years now, not a single problem. Needles are still easy to come by, if I ever do have an issue, and the belts havn't been a problem yet. Worth the investment if you don't want to spend much and still have access to the limited edition Vinyl that is now being issued for collectors."
1,defective after 10 records,I just received the Audio Technica PL 50 Turntable. The first few records played beatifully. After the fifth or sixth the speed was wavering and by the tenth it was slow and wavering. This makes it unlistenable. My guess: either the belt or motor was defective from the factory. Now I have to go through the expense and hassle of returning it for refund. Buyers beware. You get what you pay for and take a big chance ordering this cheap turntable.
1,This turntable played well for a few weeks then it started playing songs at a super rapid paste,I am not very familiar with turntable but my boyfriend is. I bought this for him and it doesn't work as well as anymore only after 3 weeks of purchase. I may be doing something wrong but I've tried everything but it keeps playing song fast althought I had adjusted the speed level.
2,too fast!!!!!!!!!!!,"Got this thing about a year ago.. its got good stereo seperation, but the sound runs too fast... and theres no adjustment... this is a problem.. Plus the needle is cheap so it will skip or you will hear all surface noise... unless your records are brand new.... and never used... its ok. but the speed thing ruins it..."
1,Garbage,"The sound quality is terrible, It is completely useless for the purpose for which I purchased it.Also, it will not play 78 RPM records."
5,Super Dooper,Got the turn table in yesterday and hooked it up to make a trip back down memory lane. Went back 40+ years and revived some old platters 33's and 45's. Played excellent would highly recommend for anyone just wanting to listen to the oldies. I am sure there are more expensive record players out there but this one does exactly what I was looking for.
1,Company is OUT OF BUSINESS,"The company ""IDvault"" stopped responding to calls, so I went down to their ""Headquarters"" in San Mateo.All the things that were in the office had been thrown in the trash (hundreds of IDvault US keys in the trash .. desk stuff, you name it.) and they definitely have closed their doors. There wasn't even a scrap of paper left.I think they closed their doors, without shutting down their website or telling anyone they were going out of business.*POOF*"
1,Not Great,"There is very little information in this 32 page pamphlet that you cannot find free on the net. The soapmaking technique (blending) is a little scarry, to me. With the added cost of shipping & handling, you could buy a much more informative hard cover REAL book for the same price at your local book store."
1,Don't waste your money,"This is not a ""book"". It is more like an overpriced pamphlet. If you have read soap making books, this book is not going to tell you anything you don't already know. If you haven't read any soap making books, this book isn't going to tell you enough information to really do anything. There are a few recipes, but not worth anything to me. It was a complete and total waste of my money. Quite frankly, I think one star rating is too high. To be honest, I don't think it deserves any stars at all."
2,Okay first draft,"First off, I do like the sections talking about the monsters of Buffy. What needs work are the sections that trace the history of the various creatures in our culture. The treatment just skims the surface. It is a great source for lists of books/movies/comics on the topic, but there is no depth. In the section on witches, there was only one or two paragraphs on the Inquisition. Several paragraphs just a mention of a title or two without stating the significance of that title to the various genres. Also, it hops around too much: movie, comic book, comic book, play; or 1980, 1910, then 1960. There is no clear thread to justify the jumping about.Again, I'll say a great listing. There are several titles I now have that I'll keep an eye out for, but reading through those sections was boring."
3,"Good recording and playing, lacks romance","I Bought this version mostly because it is SACD and Hybrid. At the time I did not find Y. Pearlmans version on Sony.From the start I did not find this version inviting to listen to, but over time I got used to it.Then I gave this to a friend as a gift and he unequivickly felt the same way but refuses to get used to it. I told him about the Pearlman version and he said it's probably good.Then I got on Amazon and bought a used Pearlman four seasons and I saw the difference.Pearlman's is dreamy, heavenly, romantic, carefree etc.. and therefore inviting.This one though perfect in instrument playing and recording to me seems rigid, forced and therefore lifeless. As if the musicians had to do this for homework to school, as if they do not understand the piece, as if they don't enjoy it or the piece does nothing for them.One thing is for sure, it does nothing for me.Sorry"
3,Ok but needs some work,over all i was very impressed with this game but the graphics are not what they should be for the xbox 360 and i think that there should be more options in the map editor like the ablity to create caves. Over all it is alot of fun online and there is a ton of game play. The map editor is hard to use at first but you get the hang of it quickly. If you are looking for a game that you will play campaign for about 24 hours and a fun always different multiplayer then you should get this. But be warned if you lag in this game it means a ton of unfun.
5,Such a great fun game to play.,I had a really fun time playing all of these far cry games. A great first person shooter action game for anyone that likes to explore and kill bad guys on some tropical islands. Have fun sneaking up through the jungle to take down your enemies and using your feral abilities to give you an edge in combat when things get out of control. If you don't already own this game then you better get it now! Seriously.
3,Not for beginners,"I have some 20 years experience in coding in Fortran 77, but finally needed to catch up with Fortran 95 and 2003. I have also bought ""Fortran 90/95 for Scientists and Engineers"" by Stephen Chapman and found that a much better book for beginners in Fortran 95. ""Fortran 95/2003 Explained"" reads, as other reviewers have noted, like a language reference. There is basically no build-up in this book and I also have the feeling that in earlier Chapters it is expected that you already know what comes in later Chapters. The examples in the book are rarely explanatory to me, they leave me often without a clear understanding of what purpose is served.For those who want to learn Fortran 95 (even for those who are already fluent in Fortran 77) I would recommend to buy the book by Stephen Chapman instead. If you want a reference manual, ""Fortran 95/2003 Explained"" will likely serve you well."
3,Not what I expected.,I thought this would be a book of instruction or patterns for creating rustic furniture. Not even close. It is a book about layouts and some architectural design for parks and campsites. I sold it to a man designing and building his own campground. He loved it.
2,Pollard needs to show some restraint,"I am sorry. I am a big GBV fan, and a big Pollard fan, but he is losing his mind. No one on earth, ever, could expect to write half the number of songs he's publishing these days and have the majority of them be interesting tunes. This album is so non-memorable it's almost unbelievable that it comes from the (former?) master of the indie pop hook, Bob Pollard, and Tobin Sprout, a catcy tunesmith himself. I have listened to it five or six times since (gasp) purchasing it for full retail price, and I find it less interesting and more irritating very time. There are plenty of great GBV albums out there, as well as good Pollard side project albums. I am not, I might add, being an ""old-GBV"" purist, it's just simply that this album pretty much blows.Do see GBV live if you get the chance, though. They rock. Bring earplugs."
1,BAD WATERS,"True, you would expect a lot of cheesiness from a John Waters compilation, but this is simply dreadful, awful, no where near the low standards Mr. Waters brings to film arts. O! How the Mighty have fallen."
1,Dissapointing,"Having watched most, if not all of John Waters films i was sorely dissapointed by this Album, obviously his name was put to something he hadn't quite looked deeply enough in to. Talk about misleading. As we all know John Waters has a certain reputation for sleaze, trash, camp, kitch and bad taste in all the best possible terms, this album had none of this. Shame on you John Waters for putting your name to a complete load of rubbish"
5,Just what you would expect from John Waters!,"John Waters has a unique take on film, and this collection of music for the festive season is no different. The titles may sound familiar but they are not the version you would see Bing Crosby singing!Put this on and let your friends and neighbbours know what you really think of this silly season."
3,Very mixed feelings.,"I love John Waters. I've seen all of his films, read all of his books, and followed his art career. In other words, I really, really wanted to like this album. Unfortunately, it just wasn't that much fun. While I enjoyed his playful liner commentary, it was too short and felt somewhat phoned in. The music, while somewhat amusing, never really reached the crescendo of joyous horror that I was really expecting. Basically, this collection was too cynical to be sincerely funny and too sincere to come off as any sort of effective parody. Sorry, John!"
3,it's ok,"it's alright - not great, not horrible. listened to it while i was traveling for christmas, good for a few laughs, but not nearly as clever as I thought it would be."
2,Cries and Cries,"We bought the first Chou Chou and still love it, and so many others love this one, I hate to comment, but I have to. This doll cries and cries until the thermometer is put in her mouth. My niece lost it. The crying is very realistic and drives me nuts! We've learned that a pen cap can stop the crying, but my niece can't use it. Also, from the start, the band-aids were too small to fit over the heart-shaped boo-boo on her wrist, so it can't be ""made better"" and fade."
3,5-year-old has enjoyed Chou Chou,"My granddaughter wanted this doll from the first time she saw it. We got it for her birthday and she loved it. Overall, the doll is very pretty, durable and cleans up well. The only problem we have ran into is when she gets sick there is only one spoon to give her medicine to make her stop crying and we have lost that little thing so many times, so Chou Chou's poor cheeks stay glowing red until we can find it."
4,Great Doll for little ones,"I bought this doll for my almost 3 year old and she loves it, as well as her 15 month old sister. I had to throw away the small parts like the medicine because of my little one. The doll has only cried once in 3 weeks and I'm wondering if there is something we are supposed to do. And the binky is removable and we lost that already. They should have made that where it can't come off. But, otherwise it's a cute doll and well worth the money."
4,bob apes the who,"but he does it so well. another great song cycle by the master. buy it for edison's memos. it alone justifies the purchase. and the rest of the songs are real good, too. 7th level shutdown is another standout.this is a different kind of record, the sound is muddy in the midrange yet the playing is tight and bob's vocals are in great form. you really owe it to yourself. and uncle bob could always use you support. so join the soft rock renegades today and help destroy the unbelievers!"
2,2 stars for 2 good songs,"One of my favorite songwriters ever, Bob Pollard, has released another couple of gems among a collection of throwaways. I dont understand the many requests for Bob to abandon the newly polished sound (Isolation Drills) and return to low-fi. He still puts out about 10 low-fi albums a year. The problem with much of his new material lies in the song-writing not the production. In any case, every album is worth having for the inevitable couple of brilliant tunes. If you are a GBV/Pollard addict like myself, pick this up. If you can borrow this from someone, borrow it and burn it."
1,Never received product.,Waited two weeks after paying for expedited shipment and never received splitter or email from vendor. If you want a splitter in your lifetime - do not order from this vendor.
3,Ultraviolence gets happier... but not enough ;),"Killing God is a very good cd from Johnny Violent. Ok, It's really happier than the first cds, but isn't bad. The first Ultraviolence track i heared was ""Electric Chair"" (from Life Of Destructor)... it's a big jump to the new kind of songs, very (happy)-hardcore-gabber fashioned, in the style of ""Adultery"".Not all tracks on this album are THAT happy-hardcore... its understandable that old fans could feel a little disappointed. It was an evolution that all could wait when we first heard ""Psychodrama"". This cd is good, but it gets a little annoying after a while... this is not that kind of cds you'll be hearing all your life.Anyway, Life Of Destructor wasn't sooooooooooooooooo good, though. Hear the samples first."

Hear the samples first."
1,Johnny Violent goes peace and love.,"I remember Ultraviolence from way back when, well, when it was ultraviolent. This is a slide down into cheesy house mixed with very unhappening happy-hardcore. Paint your hair purple, pierce and tatto yourself, wear lots of glow-in-the-dark paraphenalia and ... GET CAMP. This is terrible!"
1,Disgusting and stupid!,"I am sooooo sick of this filthy lyric music cluttering up the airwaves. This song is so childish it's sickening. Those words sound so juvenile that I,m wondering if they even came from these 20 somethings. The guitar parts are from some Stevie Nicks song from about 20 years ago but that can't save this garbage track. This song wasn't even sexy at all. It was disgusting to listen to. I would give this -ten if I could."
1,magic coat dry shampoo by four paws,they failed to mention that it has a strong perfume smell! i wanted something without the perfume smell as i have allergies to perfumes. cleans well though.magic coat dry shampoo by four paws should mention the strong smell. would cost more to send back than it is worth.
1,Straw into gold,"Well, I really do not know why the publishers pubished this. This book was really bad if i could i would give it 0 stars. The writer was creative but he didn't focus on the story. He didn't put the charaters names untill half way though the book. The plot was boring, the end didn't finish the story. There was just no point to the story. The author does do a good job of writing but that doesn't count for anything unless the story is good. If you want a good book stay away from this one!"
5,Great socks,"I was looking for a good pair of socks for my mother and found these. Not too light not heavy, just perfect. As my mom says, they pamper your feet. They are perfect for light walks and every day chores. They're definitely a ""women's best friend"" socks."
3,Size 12? No.,"If you have feet over size 10, consider another pair of socks. These have a very tight fit for my feet; They would be much more comfortable at a size 10. If you do opt for them, don't put them in the dryer -- they will stretch somewhat, but repeatedly putting them on after drying will likely rip them with repeated use."
1,Two Dead - Do not buy,"Purchased two at a local store... First was dead on arrival, second was dead after two days.Would not recommend this product for anyone."
2,They just don't last!,"It does what it says it is going to do but ""They"" have engineered a product to last for a season or a little over a year. Shame on them! I have been through a couple of units. I just ordered another one ($25.00) over the net because I need to get my own ""Ducks"" in order and research the manufacturers before I order the next. This unit used to command a price of almost $40.00 at Lowe's. I use it to fill my signature fountain automatically (6 times a day because of the splash off) and don't want to be bothered. I purchased an ""Orbit"" at Lowe's today and had to take it back. Great Guarantee (5 years) but it only offered 3 cycles/day. I need at least 4 (minimum) because of the water coming out of the geese mouths. Otherwise, I ruin my pump. It's just this simple. And, Lowe's dropped my current unit, entirely. So, if you purchase this, don't count on it lasting for more than a season."
3,Lasted about a year (with Epoxy),"I only give this as many as 3 stars because, sadly, it is the best unit I have found. DONT take this as any kind of high accolade, as the unit lasted only 6 months before needing some reinforcement with epoxy (extending its life to one year). The plastic internal (back plate) valve eventually ruptured (striping the plastic screw threads) under the pressure from the water. If the back plate was made of metal, I would give it high marks as the front motor and electronics assembly are easy to use and seemed well made, battery lasted the entire year."
5,This is the best timer for the money,"This timer is easy to program, program review is a snap. It is reliable and the price is reasonable."
4,Water hammer concern,"I've got one of these installed. It works quite well. It's reasonably easy to program and does have a quick way to manually turn it on for a few minutes.But the one thing that worries me is the water hammer it causes due to how quickly it shuts itself off. The valve closing causes a TREMENDOUS *bang* on the pipe. This can be solved by adding a water hammer arrestor but most require installation by a plumber.I previously had this timer hung off a Gilmor Y-tee so as to easily attach a hose. This was a BAD idea. The water hammer is bad enough that it BROKE the plastic Y-tee. This happened, of course, when we where on vacation. A neighbor (or someone) kindly turned off the valve to keep it from spouting water all over the place but the lack of watering killed several flowering plants. So, be warned and DO NOT put anything that's not metal ahead of this timer."
4,Double Crossing,"I really don't remember much of this book but any way here's my comment on it. Nancy Drew is all aboard for a cruise on a ship called -was it Duchess or Empress? -where her friend George Fayne is working when she bumps into Frank and Joe Hardy, who are working undercover to catch some thieves. Nancy doesn't want to get mixed up until she discovers there are more serious issues on board. A bunch of teens, whose parents are members of the CIA are also aboard the Duchess/Empress and one of them-Marcy decides to get back at her father by selling some CIA secrets to a foreign agent. When the agent is murdered and Marcy kidnapped, Nancy Has to get into action. Will she & the Hardy Boys be able to stop one of the deadliest spies of all time? Read this book to find out"
2,Pretty lame,Very long with a lot of eye exercises but nothing really about really increasing comprehension. Didn't help me or my daughter.
3,What a life!,"Allan had one heck of a life. Makes you wonder what a little determination and a lot of tolerance for being arrested can do for a guy!The only gripe I have is that the book needs a good editor. It could stand to be cut by a quarter through tighter, crisper writing. But in terms of the story, this guy ""walked the walk"".Thanks for sharing the journey with us."
3,Not so good until ch7 (preparing to broadcast at sea),"Eventhough I think that Christianity is a fundementle personalty flaw, I do believe that Allen Weiner is a true American Hero. To have over come so much and still believe in the power and beauty of radio is truly a feat of patreotic proportions. This is the true story of the man that tought an entire generation how to ""Talk Hard"" and endure. If you love radio, as I do, you need to read this book! James Lane (MonkeyWrenchRadio)"
4,Menergy Rocks Out!,"For the last year or two, I've been diving head first into a giant vat of hiphop lifestyles. Only to emerge with one question, ""Where's rock?"" No!!! Not the rock you smoke, the rock you hear, the rock you feel, the rock you live. When was the last good rock album anyway? Something not considered ""Emo"" or ""Alternative"" or a hundred other things. ROCK remember? Guitars, Bass, Drums? A singer shredding his vocal chords just to shatter the ear drums of an attentive audience. Where did it all go? Into ""Menergy"" that's where.Yes this album rocks! And it rocks hard! Prepared to be rocked like a million metaphors associated with the word rock. Rock of Ages! The riffs are well thought out, the style is fearless, and the structure is solid. No Matchbox 20's burnin this brick house down.Seriously, if you want to remember what it was like to Rock? Then don't sit there like a Rock. Rock on over to your music store and grab this Rock album. And prepare to get ROCKED!!"
2,A dreadful let-down.,"Sigh. I am an enourmous fan of Gibson's earlier works, but ""Idoru"" - at least as evidenced by this audio cassette - is slightly boring and comes across as lifeless: almost like someone imitating Gibson. The reader does a fine job and is not to fault. The nanotechnology aspect held my attention but it goes nowhere. After the disappointment of ""Virtual Light"", I am wondering if Gibson has caved into the ""easy money"" and is just ""cranking it out"".David Findleyfindleydg@aol.com"
3,"Been there, done that.","Sir Gibson seems to be recycling ideas now that he has achieved celebrity status. While reading Idoru I slapped my forehead more than once saying, ""Its deja vu all over again!"" Perhaps it is too much to ask for the sizzle and shock of Neuromancer again, but please Mr. Gibson, have some new ideas"
3,Not Free SF Reader,"The music industry is a bit fake.Not that that is something that will surprise a lot of people. A fair helping of biting satire here as a bloke in a band looks set to marry a computer generated pop star.More media shenanigans as a bloke runs foul of his employer after uncovering dodgy goings on, and the fans of the band who has a member crazy enough to want to marry into the digerati sends someone to investigate.3 out of 5"
2,What was that all about,"I am a hardcore Gibson fan, or should I say was. I was really looking forward to Idoru and was let down by the plot. He does get into the cyberpunk dimensions, but the book is almost already outdated. I actually chucked the book after the 1st hundred pages and decided to give it another chance a couple of weeks later. I got into it, however it was all in all sort of a disappointment. Maybe it was because I was expecting so much more. If this would have been written by another author I may have given the book 3 stars, but from Gibson one should expect more. I will continue to read his books in hopes of another great one comming along."
2,Stretched Too Far,"The best thing I can say about ""Idoru"" is that it's perfectly readable. The writing is competent. The story has its moments. But the characters and plot ultimately stretch too thin. It's like Gibson felt he needed to have one more story in the ""Neuromancer"" world to show off some ideas he had for tech that hadn't been used yet. The best work of this loose series is definitely in the earlier novels."
2,Idoru is no Wintermute,"This is only the 3rd Gibson book I've read. The first 2 were Neuromancer and Count Zero. This book is a stark contrast to the cyber cowboys I'm familiar with. I enjoyed the fill of techno concepts and descriptions. When it comes to plot, there really isn't much tension or development.I kept waiting for some kind of revelation or tension. The whole book is about a rock star marrying an Idoru, a personofied AI. To my chagrin, after enduring plodding situations that do nothing more than describe interesting concepts like living buildings and virtual reality global network navigation (not a new concept) there is no resolution to the big questions. In short, I was left wondering, ""What consipracy? What bandwidth?"". It rambles and pedants but doesn't have a point, that I could identify. The final chapter feels like one big run-on sentence written by a 14 year old instead of an epilogue.However, I'm still a Gibson fan."
2,A dud from a sci-fi legend,"Obviously science fiction depends on the suspension of disbelief, but the events in this book verge on the ridiculous. The story seems haistily put together and the characters are one-dimentional. It reads well, but it provides little of the wonder that Gibson's work usually inspires."
2,Watered Down Snowcrash,"I read this book becuase someone suggested it to me, and I mustsay, I was completely disapointed in it. After reading the brilliant""Snowcrash"" by Stephenson, this book seemed watered down, and basically pathetic. The concepts were similar, the basic idea the same, but he does not command the english language with nearly the skill Stephenson does. Admittedly, the fan club Idea, and the way he presented it intrigued me, but not enough to save the book in my eyes."
4,A Good Read,"Ms. Robinson contiues her stories set in Elizabethan England with Lord of Enchantment. Morgan St. John is a dark and mysterious hero to whom we were first introduced in Robinson's Lady Valiant. Of all the books in the series, Lord of Enchantment is my least favorite. I like the heroine, Pen Fairfax, who is unique and unusual without being annoying, and the hero was dreamy. As is the norm with Ms. Robinson's works, the writing was excellent. I am not the biggest fan of a romance in which one party has amnesia, which is why I docked the rating one star. Lord of Enchantment is still an enjoyable addition to the series."
5,A winning Combo,"I'll just say, it's pure delight to hear to of Japan's best Jazz players work together. If you can find this disc at a price you can deal with, you will have spent the money wisely. Also, check out any of the discs by either Makoto or Kazumi with their own band: Mokoto Ozono Trio, and Kazumi Watanabe New Electric Trio. Great stuff!!!"
4,Very informative and well structured,"The book provides a good overview of the history of employee ownership initiatives. However, the main value of the book resides in the well documented, real-world examples it provides about how companies in recent times have addressed the employee ownership issue. These examples provide very valuable insight for anybody considering implementing an employee ownership plan. The reason I give 4 stars instead of 5 is because the book is a little repetitive."
2,they need to simplify this magizine,"I am a single 30 year old woman, middle class, and no kids. I subscribe to this and several fashion magazines. I've realized I have started dreading getting this magazine. Why? Because it is just so huge with so much information it's like a homework assignment just to get through it. There is some good information, articles I rip out, but it's heck sorting through all the magazine to get to the small bit I would actually use. When they give you tips say ""15 minute speed-cleaning"" they give you 1 minute for something the realistically takes 5 minutes. Or they suggest you organize your kitchen with 50 little containers that cost $20 each. A simple outfit to them includes a $200 sweater and not enough guidance to apply the fashion rule with more reasonable priced pieces. I've really tried to like this magazine but really don't have time to look for the needle in the haystack. I've found woman's day (though matronly at times) to more helpful with everyday life."
2,no service yet!,"I am still waiting for confirmation of this subscription. While I know that the magazine should not arrive for a few more weeks, some communication from them woud be helpful. All I have received so far is a bill for $24, not the $5 deal."
2,Have Not Received Yet.,"I really love the magazine, but I have not received the first issue from my subscription yet."
1,Please don't get this magazine unless your prefer wrong info,"This magazine prints fictious statements without second guessing its content. It doesn't care that they are missinforming its readers. In the August edition it said breastfeeding was a waste of time yet had no VALID proof to back it up. Any company who would rather tell its readers to formula feeed over Breastfeed, is disgraceful!!!!"
1,"Breastfeeding...a ""waste of time""?","Forget this magazine.I read the article ""20 Rules to Break Now"" in the recent edition of Real Simple Magazine. I have to say I'm very surprised at the article and at the magazine for publishing it!I am a mom who has done months of breastfeeding, followed by months of bottle-feeding, and frankly (all the scientifically-proven benefits aside), the reality is that it is just plain easier and more convenient to breastfeed anytime than to prepare and feed a bottle.The article focuses on many items that are quite frivolous, and to include the decision to breastfeed along with these trivial issues is misleading, and unfair to your readers. Knowing what I do about the importance of breastfeeding casts serious doubts in my mind with regard to their other health-related tips."
2,must to be desired,"This magazine was disappointing. I really thought I would find some good articles, ideas etc... but all I found was expensive suggestions to buy buy buy stuff that was a ton of money, be wasteful with what I call ""lazy ideas"" & it has tons of ads-though I know ads are needed-too much makes me never buy a magazine again-I'm not paying for a magazine to look at product ads with no real content. A few ideas were good but overall I was very disappointed in this magazine. If you want to live a more simple life try the library & look for some good books rather then purchasing this magazine."
2,Real Simpleton,"I've subsribed to Real Simple since the beginning. I agree with the other posts that it's become too simple. At first it was refreshing & I sent gift subscriptions to my daughter and a girlfriend. Now I'm finding the content just plain boring. O.K., I've gotten organized, purchased a basic wardrobe, thinned out clutter. Now what? Real Simpleton is starting to leave me wanting more. It lacks creativity and new ideas. I think I'll be allowing my subscription to lapse."
2,Not worth the time to read,"Not nearly useful enough to justify the time spent reading it. It seems to be a series of short articles with recipes, household hints, etc."
3,Disappointed,"I haven't received this item. I was disappointed to see that the coupon offered with this subscription did not work. I feel misled. While I know that this disappointment should not affect the product, I wasn't given another opportunity to voice my concern about having been baited. The Promoters apology and offer of a discount on a future purchase doesn't make me feel better.I've had a subscription to this magazine in the past and was pleased with it's relevant and timely content, attractive colors and layout. However, the price is rather dear for a person on a budget and I have little time for reading magazines, so I was trying to justify buying it based on the advertised coupon discount. I hope that Amazon will check these offers before presenting them in the future."
1,Wait until you get a renewal direct from the magazine - it will be less than renewing through Amazon,"While renewing is painless, the day after I renewed, I got a much better offer directly from the magazine. about 20% less. So, it pays to wait. Also, there is no way you can go back in and stop the renewal, unlike being able to cancel an order."
1,another no show,I ordered this magazine on Nov. 30. I have yet to receive a single issue. I have contacted customer service and have gotten no satisfaction as to when I can expect my first issue. I contacted the magazine directly and they have extended my subscription to March. I am very disappointed in Amazon's magazine service and do not recommend it to anyone.
1,I hate automatic subscription renewals!,"I went to order this magazine as a gift for my wife, who likes it, but I had to sign up to automatically renew in order to do so. I tried to call their customer service, but they were closed. That is a lousy way to do business!"
4,Simply Wonderful,I still have the very first issue I bought of this magazine. I love all the wonderful recipes. Each recipe I have tried is superb! It also has helpful information such as product reviews and simple solutions to every day household/life problems. This magazine is a fun read!
1,Real SImple Magazine,The publication is mostly ads. Not much substance of any kind. Would not renew it.
1,Fooled Again,I bought this magazine with high hopes and was disapointed. Thinking I may have just got a bad issue I bought another one next month. I was disapointed again. Pretty pictures but no real content. The magazine is just cashing in on the Simplicity movement and really has nothing to do with it. IT is just another glorified Fashion/Design magazine. On top of this it stated that Breastfeeding was a waste of time. Any magazine that states my children are a waste of time is not going to be part of my household reading. I strongly suggest this magazine be by-passed.
1,Still haven't recieved,It is exactly 2 months to the day and I still haven't received this purchase yet.
3,"Cute, but not as helpful as I thought... but I do like it","Well, it's been a few months into my new subscription and I enjoy reading it. I have definitely gotten some cool ideas out of it... but some articles really seem out of whack or don't make sense. I'll keep trying it out..."
5,Love Real Simple!,"I've been a subscriber to this magazine for years now and I absolutely love it. From ideas for the home to kid-friendly recipes, this magazine has it all! I just wish Amazon would have sent a reminder about auto-renewal prior to renewing my magazine."
4,real simple,"I enjoy the magazine. It has great photos, a plethora of recipes and new ideas for simplifying our lives."
3,Real Simple Vs. Voluntary Simplicity,"I subscribed to this magazine believing that it would have advice relating to scaling back and living better with less. However, this magazine is definitely geared towards women who don't mind paying $200+ for ""the perfect white shirt"" and are strugging to create a savings plan with six-figure incomes.That being said, I love the recipes, the meal planners are excellent, and the organization tips I've found useful too. A fun magazine, as long as you don't take it too seriously."
2,Are these journalists professional writers?,I think the content of this magazine could be very interesting. I have looked through it a few times and considered a subscription. I hesitate to buy a publication from a company unable to write the title in correct English. Virginia in Washington
1,Real Simple Magazine,"I do love the magazine, but I've yet to receive one! I ordered in November and it's now February."
3,Pros and Cons,"There are many aspects of Real Simple to recommend. As other reviewers mention, the quality of the paper and photography make flipping through the pages a pleasant experience. Many of the articles address questions you may have wondered about. I like the product comparisons -- best black pants, best jean jackets, etc.My main complaint is that the magazine has a definite New Age/Eastern point of view when addressing spiritual issues. I would prefer that they didn't get into spirituality and stick to home decor, practical living tips, makeup, and recipes. I'll read my Bible and go to church for the spiritual stuff. You are out of your depth there, Real Simple."
4,"Love the content, hate the tiny font","I usually enjoy about three of the articles in this magazine, which makes it worth the price of the magazine to me. I find particular enjoyment in the house and organization articles.However, is it just me or is this magazine plainly hard to read on the subway? Its large size and heft make it a little bit of a drag on my shoulder to carry in my purse. Plus, its small font size makes me have to place my face a little too close for comfort to the page in order to read it. I wear contact lenses so I don't have ""bad eyes"". I think I have normal eyes, and yet, this font is uncomfortable to read because of its small font size.In summary, I enjoy this magazine a lot, but prefer House Beautiful for its easy-to-read font size and ease of carrying (not too heavy/bulky). True, I get less content with House Beautiful, but that magazine also costs less on Amazon, which makes up for it in my opinion."
3,Watch is fine but leather band deteriorates quickly,"Purchased this in July 2007 and really liked that it fit my small wrist better than any other watch I've had. However, the black leather band fell apart in about 9 months. I found a replacement band (also black leather) and it lasted all of 6 months. This watch requires a 7mm band, which is difficult to find for less than the cost of the watch. I got about 15 months use out of the watch and still have the watch but the battery is now dead and I think I'll just try another watch. I don't get my watches wet (even though this one is water resistant) and am generally not hard on anything, so I'm surprised the bands are so poorly made that they won't last a year."
3,"Nice simple watch, but very small","I've had this watch for several months now and I really like it. The second hand is nice for timing things, and it is very easy to read the time. It's also very simple so it doesn't compete with other jewelery. However, as other reviews stated, this watch is VERY small. My writs are almost exactly 6 inches around and I wear this watch on the third-largest size, so it definitely wouldn't go more than ~6.5 inches around your wrist. Other than that, it's very nice, delicate, and simple."
5,Tiny and classic,I have little wrists but this watch fits very nicely without a lot of extra pegs hanging off the end. Easy to read and looks good with anything because it's not a statement watch.
3,Women's Timex watch,This watch appears larger than it is. The face is petite and the band is narrow and not very long.
2,Not what I expected,I ordered two brain jello molds for an Anatomy speech and project in college. The mold was fragile and broke apart when I tried to make the jello. It was not what I expected. A big dissapointment.
5,Great for parties or class!,"I originally bought this for the Psychology class I was teaching and it was a riot to make the ""real brain"" recipe so it looks like a realistic gray brain. Doubles as a fun treat for Halloween!"
5,An educational toy,"This was given to my son for christmas from his aunt. He loves this gift, it's a very educational gift. It's great and easy to use."
1,never again,I bought this for my daughter last year and it was a waste of money. I thought she would enjoy making this and she was bored immediately.
5,"PULKAS ARE THE BEST THERE WAS, ARE AND EVERY WILL BE!","Pulkas are the type of band that will only be created once. The lads combine a frenzied mix of Deftones and Tool into a big, angry, hard as nails beast that goes straight for your throat. ""Loaded"" and ""Control"" are two of the best songs I have ever heard with ""This is it"" snapping closely at the heels. If you buy only one album ever ""Greed"" is the one to get!"
4,"Glad I bought it, but ...","... a mixed value. I have the 3100 so everything seems compatible, but as mentioned in another review the case is a bit tight for the camera, especially once you put the anti-glare-adaptor-ring thing on the lens. I like all the pockets and stuff, and hope to be using the charger and adaptor on vacation. These cameras eat batteries!If you have a couple of family members or a couple of cameras, this could still be a good deal. We seem to be getting good use out of all the pieces (but I still preferred to buy another case for my 3100 -- the Targus DBMS01, see review)."
3,A bit dated,"These ""biographies"" are all written before Queen Victoria died so they are a bit dated and all have ""glowing"" things to say about the subject ...not a HINT of scandal or inbreeding ..but it's a nice read to see how the 19th century ""slanted"" their news!"
5,The book is like the women: sexy and bold,"I find this exciting volume to be an excellent addition to the Bond universe: gorgeous photos, elegant layout, and clean, evocative prose. As an historical accounting of the films' sexual genealogy, it is bold and engaging. As a collection the sort of anecdotes one expects from any 'book about movies' it is charming and understated. And I don't feel that it is the sort of book that will appeal only to hardcore fans: it has a definite mainstream appeal which I appreciate. I already bought it for my father's Channukah present, and another copy for my brother's birthday is on the way."
5,excellent tool,I used this tool on a 2010 Honda Civic rear caliper. This tool has multiple pin types so it would work on a variety of calipers.
3,A lush thrird album from the poly-rhythmic Too Pure-sters,"Amelia finds Long Fin Killie fleshing out their dense poly-rhythmic songs with multi-layered guitars and strings. Unlike past albums where seemingly all but the operatic vocals served the rhythm, this album's instrumentation swoons and swells, shimmering in the music's staccato gaps. In addition, the album finds a new home for the band in lock grove repitition (at times reminiscent of the Wedding Present's late eighties output). All in all a very pleasing record, and an exciting new direction for the band."
3,Umm... not your typical LKH book...,"Nightseer is very... magical. There is no real romance, just a girl trying to find herself and save others... A very different read, but enjoyable nonetheless."
4,Do not compare to her other books,"I was reading the other reveiws and they are all comparing this book the anita Blake series. DONT. this book came out before she wrote that series. I Have to say that this is one of her best books that i have read. her short stories in ""strange Candy"" are preety good to. But if you do pick up ""NightSeer"" dont expect it to be like her other books. Its better."
3,Just OK...,"""Nightseer"" is the debut novel by Laurell K. Hamilton. The novel is centered around Keleios, a sorcerer that is seeking to avenge the murder of her mother and has the gift of prophecy.I had trouble reading this novel. It was very science fictiony and the plot was a little dull. I am glad Hamilton abandoned this writing style and storyline. I found the idea of a ""seer"" to be fascinating, but unfortunately there was no pay-off here. I can't say that I would recommend this novel."
1,THIS BOOK WAS TERRIBLE!!,"I HAVE READ ALL OF LAURELL K. HAMILTON'S BOOKS AND HAVE NEVER BEEN DISAPOINTED IN ANY OF THEM. IN FACT QUITE THE OPPOSITE....I WOULD RECOMEND ALL HER BOOKS TO ANYONE.BUT ""NIGHTSEER"" IS NOT EVEN WORTH GRADING IF I HAD TO I WOULD GIVE IT A F-.KELEIOS IS A PROPHET. IT TAKES PLACE IN A DIFFERENT LAND. AND THE WHOLE THING IS JUST VERY CONFUSING FROM THERE."
5,Nightseer,"Nightseer is very intersting, and the book arrive very promply. It is a pleasure ordering from Amazon.com.Ruth Riddle"
3,Nightseer,"I'll make this brief. Nightseer was paced almost too quickly. Not enough places for the reader to catch their breath. It also needed more back story and requires one, if not two more volumes to finish the story. Yet Ms. Hamilton has moved on to bigger and better things. I enjoyed the book. It just needed better pacing."
1,perfectly dreadful,"Although I am not a great fan of Hamilton's Vampire Hunter series, I did like A Kiss of Shadows (call it soft porn if you like--it was still a good interesting read; magic in our midst is a perfectly respectable fantasy scenario). I picked up Nightseer, hoping that it would have some of that same imaginative fun feel to it. Sadly, it does not. I can only theorize that Hamilton wrote Nightseer while she was in high school and just warming up as a writer. It is plotless, and in the end, just plain boring. I wish I'd skipped it."
4,Where's part 2?,"I just loved this book. In fact, I like Nightseer even better than the authors Anita Blake series. I picked up my copy back when I was in high school about 8 years ago, and haven't regreted it. The magic system, while obviously derived from D&D is still very entertaining. There's a lot of adventure and enough explanations so that you aren't 'completely' in the dark, but it still needs a sequal. I know that writting is hard, but I just want to know, 'WHEN IS PART 2 COMING OUT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!' My recommendation, any fantasy fan who doesn't buy this needs to get their head examined!"
2,Everyone has to have a first book...,"... and this was Ms. Hamilton's. This book was actually reprinted AFTER she became famous with the Anita Blake series. It is a nice story, but it's obvious why it was never a big seller. The story line is uneven and there seems to be too much background/backflashing information - as if there was a prequel no one told us about.It's worth checking out at the library, but save your money for the first 8 or 9 books of the Anita Blake, Vampire Executioner series - a much better read."
3,very basic,"This book is for the most novice brand new user of OS X.4. If you've ever used a Mac, even OS9, don't bother with this book, its too basic."
5,A must for new and veteran Mac users,"I have bought three editions of The Little Mac Book over the years, and I learn something new every time I pick it up. It's a great gift idea for a new Mac user, as well as long-time owners. We Mac people are very loyal, and Robin Williams is certainly a very favorite of mine! It's almost like talking to a old friend."
5,"The Little Mac Book, Tiger Edition",This book helped me get updated to the Tiger Operating System.I have always relied on the Little Mac Books for computer questions.
3,A book for dummy,"This is book is like an introductry to computer, if you have never used any computer and just bought MAC, then this is the one for your, other than that, dont' buy it, waste money."
4,The Little Mac Book (for dummies),"I haven't yet used this book extensively, but did have an earlier edition and it was invaluable. Explanations anyone over the age of 12 can readily understand. Anyone under the age of 12 doesn't need a manual. It's the first book I reach for when having a difficulty w/my Mac or when I want to learn something new."
1,Don't waste your money.,"This product is so terrible, it should be taken off the market. The microscope does not work and it's very disappointing to explain to a child, who starts out enthusiastic, why we can't see anything. This product actually made me angry."
3,Not so excited about this one,"I ordered this kit because we had so immensely enjoyed other kits by the same company, such as Fizzy Foamy Science and My First Science Kit. I expected the same quality of experiments in this kit, but was left a little disappointed. We couldn't even get the microscope to work! I think this kit could have used a little more work before it went out. If you're purchasing kits, start with one of the two I mentioned above - they are by the same company, and are excellent!"
3,"Perfect for a preschooler, kindergartner","My son is 5 and we've had fun with this set. It is perfect for his age, but I would not recommend it for kids much older.The microscope has no light, so use a flashlight or lamp with it."
2,Why the Change?,"I bought this and a couple of other science sets for my 5 year old grandson after much comparing. The set shown here says on the cover that it is for ""4 years"" old. When the set arrived, the box said ""8 years"" with no explanation for the change. Otherwise, it's the same set with the rest of the box the same and the same contents.The change worried me, though I did end up giving it to my grandson. His mother will have to help him anyway and my fingers are crossed hoping there is no danger for a 5 year old."
2,UPDATED - Not Reliable,"BACKGROUND:I purchased a used travel trailer (2003 Surveyor SV210) and it was missing one of the caps/plugs on the rear bumper. This was a bit of a concern as the sewage hose and some related pieces are stored inside the rear bumper and I certainly didn't want to lose them while travelling. I measured up the bumper (4"" !) and ordered two of these to keep both caps looking the same.MY EXPERIENCE (UPDATED - July 5/11):On a recent camping trip that took us down some rougher gravel roads, neither of these bumper caps managed to stay in place. Neither completely fell out but both were pretty close to being lost. I am now unsure as to whether or not I can trust these bumper caps and am considering replacing them with something that stays in place better. The funny thing is, they are a difficult to insert and seem very snug but once they start to vibrate they push themselves out."
2,You only get one even though picture shows 2!!!!,The product seems to be fine but the descripition is deceptive. I though i was bying a pair since that is what all the pictures show. Not as good of a deal for one.
3,A Special Education: One Family's Journey Through the Maze of Learning Disabilities,"I did not really enjoy this book. This book was assigned for a graduate class I was taking. The book was about Dana, the mother, for the most part. The daughter, who has learning differences only gave her view in one chapter.Pretty much, this family is a high-society New York family with many resources available because of their wealth. Most certainly, the average family would not find the resources that they had available for their daughter."
5,Exceptionally Good Book,"I have used this book repeatedly to help educate teachers, administrators, mental health personnel, and parents to the needs of highly and profoundly gifted children. Dr. Gross packs terrific information into a lengthy *and* very readable book."
2,Unfulfilled promise,"Usually, I place a good amount of trust in the general consensus formed by reviewers at amazon, and buy accordingly. However, this album is somewhat of a letdown, especially considering the rave reviews it has received. The vocals cross the thin line between heartbreaking fragility (as can be heard in the better songs of Wilco, Radiohead, the Flaming Lips, or The Cardigans (yes, the Cardigans are a good band!)) into, well, weakness. I would assume that 'weak' was not the intent, but it is the product. When coupled with one to many overly sentimental chord changes (Major IV to minor iv, ad nauseum), you get something that tries too hard to sound bittersweet. All the time. Still, it deserves two stars as these flaws do not make the songs bad; to the contrary, they are beyond bearable. Just not a work of genius, by any stretch."
4,Great Product!,"I like it a lot! My Glock 22 .40 Cal fits great in the holster. All and all I love the thing! No insert slots for cevlar but other than that, It IS the Beez Kneez!"
3,strong chemical odor,"This made in China vest has a price & features that made it a purchase. I bought one for an emergency tote I am assembling. It provides a way to assemble magazines, multi-tools, etc. in one organized location that can be worn when needed. I gave it a lower rating because of a strong chemical odor when it was unpackaged. It's been hanging outside on my deck for 4 weeks. I didn't want to wash it because I was thinking of returning it. But the odor has diminished so I will wash it. I hope it will be good to go. Contacting the seller about the odor didn't garner any kind of useful response. I suppose the seller wants to ignore a potential issue. If anyone around you has chemical odor sensitivity don't buy this vest. I suspect the Chinese assemblers might be using something not allowed for manufacturing in other countries."
4,tactical vest,"This vest fits moderate to compact pistols well. I purchased it to replace my hip holster so that I could throw it on quicker and carry my S & W sigma. It can fit reasonably well, although I only weigh 180 lbs and have a 42"" chest the vest bounces on me a little when I move, and the shoulders taken all the way in bunch up. All of my magazines fit in it comfortably and so do rifle mags/strips. It is a good intro vest that I easily modified and has places on the back for additions. I'm glad I purchased it and feel that it is strongly made."
4,Exploring the Wilds,"A cacophony of drums and electronic noises rushes us from song to song, each of which inexplicably takes its time to get where it's going. This time-confusion is exploited to great effect, leaving the listener a bit off-kilter for a time after listening. Margaret Fiedler's vocals are outstandingly understated, as usual, getting lost in the mix only when necessary. Fun and confusing."
5,Must have for first time visitor or return visitor to Rio,"I picked up this book before my recent trip to Brazil for Carnival. It is a must have for anyone making their first trip to Brazil or someone who's been there before. The book is all in color, unlike other travel guides which are printed like the yellow pages.. It has SPECIFIC recommendations per night and what you want to do. They are right on.Also, the RFP discounts more then pay for the book. Additionaly they sometimes allow you toyou cut lines sometimes."
5,Best price for Gorham flatware,"I checked several websites for the Melonbud pattern of Gorham stainless flatware and Amazon's was the best price. Besides that, I got free shipping for being over $25! The flatware came wrapped in its original packaging, with a company guarantee slip, and protective outer wrap. All the pieces were perfect!"
3,Good video - but sounds are wrong,"I bought this video for my daughter because she loves Maisy. I teach 1st grade, and when we watched it they say the wrong sounds for some of the letters. For example for t they would say ""tuh"", when it should really just be the t sound without the uh on the end. When working on Phonics in Kindergarten, the children say just the consonant sound without adding a vowel sound onto the end."
4,"So far, so good!","I've only used it once (to inflate the tires on my car), and it worked great. Plan to purchase a proper gauge extension cord for outdoor usage like inflating vehicle tires."
1,Junk - Burnt Up In 1 Year Of Light Use,"It was a nice pump, be it a bit loud, when it worked.It burnt up after 1 year of light use - totally unacceptable. Don't waste your money!"
2,What a Shame (sham),"I had only used this twice before the fatal 3rd time. I noticed during the first two times that the air nozzle was very, very tight. I had a lot of difficulty removing once tire was inflated. The compressor itself worked very well.....very fast and powerful. Was impressed but that nozzle thing.....Well, on the third use, sure enough, the nozzle broke when trying to remove it from the tire. Air is pouring out of my tire and this thing would not let go of it. In reading the other reviews, it sounds like I wouldn't have had many uses left anyway. A pure waste of money. Do not buy."
2,It worked great for two months,I purchased this to inflate bike and car tires. It worked great for two months and then the motor burned and it no longer functions. Disappointed with the quality.
1,Worthless,Opened the box plugged it in and NOTHING....didn't work at all....this company needs a Quality Assurance department that will check these things before they send them out.I sent this back and got the Black & Decker model that does the same thing and it works great.
1,Did not last very long,"We bought this in the summer of 2008. We have three cars and check the air about 4 times per year. Some of the reviewers said it burned out after a few years, but I figured they must have been heavy users of it. The first 3 years (2008, 2009, & 2010) it inflated tires very fast. Last year the motor sounded like it was running on half speed and it took much longer to inflate the tires. Then last fall inflating the winter tires, it stopped and spewed out smoke. I just ordered a Viair from Amazon because of all 12V compressors, they have the highest customer ratings."
1,OK while it lasted,This worked ok while it worked. It only lasted for 4 years before it died. For about sixty bucks it should have lasted way longer. Would not buy again. My five year old son asked why it started smoking and died. I said that it was because it's a piece of junk!
1,burned out after 3 years of light use,"I've bought Bon-Aire products in the past, and generally satisfied with their performance. Initially I was very happy about the Bon-Aire BA121 because it inflates tires much faster than the old Bon-Aire AC150 I previously owned(and it still runs). The problem with the BA121 is that it failed after 3 years of relatively light use. I inflate 2 sets of 4 tires 4 times a year. That comes out to 32 inflations a year. So in 3 years that would be 96 inflations. And then it died a premature death."
1,Not Durable,I've had this compressor for about a year and a half and used it to top off tires on 2 cars about 6 - 8 times. Fired it up today and the motor whines but the compressor is dead. Not recommended!
4,Better Than Any Standard 12 volt Inflator,I bought this compressor to top off the large tires on our RV and other vehicles. It does that without taking excessive storage space.
1,Bon-Aire reliability,"I have owned two of these compressors bought under the Sears Craftsman name. I use it to fill my big truck tires and the tires on my trailer. It works great and fills them fairly fast, but both units have broken after about 2 years. The mechanical connection between the motor and compressor breaks. There are no spare parts to order, so you are out $50. Don't buy this!"
2,Disappointed,"I loved this unit when it was working. Very fast at filling up tires and also great with pool toys, balls, etc. But the unit died on me tonight after less than 3 years of light use (probably used it less than 20 times. This is an unacceptably short lifespan."
2,One-year compressor,"I originally bought this two years ago (January 2008). It worked well even though it felt flimsy. A few days short of its one-year warranty, it died. Bon-Aire was good about sending a new one (provided that I cover the $10 shipping cost) when I called. The replacement arrived and I used it in a similar fashion - inflating an air mattress and inflating my car's tires. I followed the recommendation religiously: allow it to cool down for at least 10 minutes for every 10 minutes of continuous use. Today the replacement died, just about one year after it arrived. I'm done with Bon-Aire and will seek a higher quality product that I can get more than a year's use out of given how little I use it.I should know better: you get what you pay for."
2,Somebody must have had it in for Kim Cattrall to put her in this,"Like my title says, someone must have had it in for Kim Cattrall to put her in this thing. Ms. Cattrall is always worth watching, but she shares the stage with a lot of other people who are not. After she steps off the screen the disk is a great cure for insomnia, but I can sleep well without it, thank you. The surprising thing is, it is produced by HBO, which is otherwise noted for the exceptional quality of their productions. This is a disk you will want if you are a Kim Cattrall collector. Otherwise, keep your money in your pants."
3,It gives you great sex education but could have been a lot better,"I am a big fan of Kim Cattrall and I thought she did a great job being the host of this documentary. She educates you own sex like the history of it and showing us museum's that has picture's of greeks. She even went to England were the ground was carved shaped into a giant penius which would never be in the U.S.What I hated about this documtary was not enough nudity and they didn't show people actually having sex all they did was talked about sex. And Kim Cattrall who played in ""Sex in the City"" she had lot's of sex on that show but in Sexual Intelligence she doesn't even get fully naked not even one time. She's only naked on the DVD cover just her way to get people to buy this what a rip off.I wish Kim Cattrell could play in adult movies."
4,quality dance music,"producers like:Mateo & Matos, Litle ""Louie"" Vega, Mathias Heilbronn, need to say more???. Buy this!."
5,Excellent quality cookware for a super price!,"I bought a 17-piece set of Cuisinart Chef's Classic stainless cookware, plus a 1-qt. saucier and the double boiler. I am very pleased with all of them, and these 20 pieces are all I should ever need!"
4,Great size for making 2 quarts of yogurt,"My usual 2 quart double boiler was just too small for making 2 quarts of yogurt. There was a little head room, but not much. The Cuisinart double boiler was the only large size that I could find. The curved bottom is nice for using a whisk in the pan, but the only drawback is that it rocks trying to set it on a counter. Not a good idea. So, I just set it in the sink drain when I need to set it down not in the lower pot. Great product."
3,"Good quality, but too big","I love my Cuisinart stainless cookware set. I needed a new double boiler and decided to stick with the same brand, despite some of the reviews I had read online. This double boiler is just too big for my needs. In addition, it is difficult to store because it doesn't have a flat bottom. The quality of this product is excellent. I just don't like it's shape and size."
5,An excellent and imaginative study guide,"The text is extremely well organized, laced with humor, and complemented with exercises and answers that do a good job of testing and reinforcing the reader's understanding of the topics. The subject matter is explained clearly and imaginatively.It's head and shoulders above any of the Schaum type guides, and is fun to read alone or in conjunction with a standard text."
4,R.I.P,heres the line up:hhh vs steve austin * horrable matchbritish bulldog and owen heart vs smoaking guns *** owen and bulldog make all matches goodmarc mero vs goldust**** good matchsycho sid vs vader*** great but to shortundertaker vs mankind***** great the best match on the vido
4,Pregardien isn't helped by the fortepiano,"the period instrument watchdogs descend whenever somebody points out that the foretepiano is tinkly and underpowered compared to a modern piano, and the loss of expressivity is especially harmful here, becasue Christoph Pregardien acquits himself so well in the vocal part. He has lingered on the edge of fame for a long time and is basically known to lieder fans, like the baritone Wolfgang Holzmeier, with whom he shares a smooth, creamy tone, middle-of-the-road instincts, and a certain lack of emotional depth. Even so, Pregardien sounds gorgeous here, and without finding any song deeply memorable, I enjoyed the performance as a whole. The accompanist, Andreas Staier, is quite accomplished on the fortepiano and handles its limitations well; however, he doesn't seem to have any particular insights--or maybe the ""pub piano"" sound diminishes them."
5,"Beautiful, Intense, Inspiring, and Original","I think this is what an individual photographers book should be. This book is really an inspiration. So beautiful, bold and personal. So much variety in the images. One of my favorite photography books ever. Awesome, thank you Glen E. Friedman."
3,Different but good!,"When I bought ""Space Age Bacherlor Pad Music,"" I wasn't quite sure what to expect. I was expecting more trance rock, or their new sound (ie. Dots and Loops or Microhunters). What I got was a little disappointing.A side from being a rather short album, the content is not that cohesive. However, its not as great as their secound album or ""Cobra Phases..."""
3,Heydrich assassination,"An interesting work with many unique photographs, worth buying for that reason alone. However, I find many of the author's conclusions flawed which takes the edge off an otherwise worthwhile book."
4,Extra R.V. coaxial,"We were introduced to this RCA 6' digital coaxial cable by another camper...A very useful item for your satellite dish, antenna, box and T.V. You never know when your cable isn't going to reach, and this will do the trick....and easily stored in the R.V."
2,No Japanese Characters,This book does not teach you how to read Japanese.It teaches you how to speak Japanese pretty good.I don't like books that don't teach Japanese characters.
2,Tedious for those not reading the Bible daily,"Your view of this book is likely to depend on your religious outlook on life. The book is full of Bible-Quotes. It uses biblical personalities and settings as examples for burnout and the things that bring burnout about. Of those examples that do not figure biblical personalities, at least half have some strong connection to the church.Personally, I feel that a book that deals with a clinical psychological issue, such as burnout, should rely on academic research and reasoning. That is missing here. Time and again the bible is taken as the source of all truth and the author's interpretation as our guiding line for doing things in life. Especially the latter makes it very difficult reading for people with academic training who are used to take a critical view of unsubstantiated statements."
5,A Very Worthwhile Read,Judge Posner's insights are always illuminating. He is throoughly mainstream one minute and totally out of teh box the next. This book will give the conventional English lit major whiplash. Icons toppled followed by cliches rejuvenated. They shouldn't worry. Posner has been making lawyers and law professors reexamine all assumptions for nearly 40 years.From some of these reveiws it seems the English Lit types are a little more protective of turf than the lawyers have been.
3,"Effective, but dissapointed","I purchased the combo kit with the expectation that it would last longer than intended. I'm currently in the process of redoing my basement and the MultiMaster combos worked perfectly. However, you go through these bits in no time. For a product that is, quite frankly over-priced, you would think they would hold their sharpness longer. I was dissapointed. The cost should equal the durability of the product. Unfortunately it does not."
4,I actually enjoyed this book!,"I am not very good at math, and I don't enjoy math at all, but I had to get this book for a math course I was taking. The book is actually quite interesting! It's kind of like a math book and a history book in one, which was cool because I very much enjoy history. It also has a lot of witty lines, which, I think, keeps the reader interested."
2,Almost OK,I've had this product for about 3 1/2 years. I used it for a relatively light weight 4/3rds DSLR and found that it was reasonably stable. It has only been used on average a few hours a week. Last week one of the wing nut locks for the smallest leg tubes broke off when I picked up and moved the tripod. I found that locks (other than the wing nut and bolt) are a white metal casting which is not very durable. Even when buying a relatively in expensive tripod I would recommend one with twist locks rather than a cast wing nut type.
3,Stay What You Were...,"""Stay What You Are"" was the first Saves the Day cd I listened to. In the beginning, I loved it. The lyrics were poetic and meaningful, and the music was great. Then I got an older album by the name of ""Can't Slow Down,"" and now, even though I hate to say it, I am a little ashamed to admit that I loved ""Stay What You Are"" as much as I did. The music sounds completely different. Although it sounds rougher, ""Can't Slow Down"" is definitely the best album, with ""Through Being Cool"" settling in the middle.In my opinion, ""At Your Funeral"" is highly overrated. ""See You"", ""Cars and Calories"", and ""Certain Tragedy"" have some nice lyrics, while ""Jukebox Breakdown"" has good riffs. ""Firefly"" is ok, and ""As Your Ghost Takes Flight"" is just sick. As for the other tracks, I don't care for them so I'll just leave them out. Overall, this cd was ok. But I definitely recommend that you get Saves the Day's ""I'm Sorry I'm Leaving"" EP. It's all acoustic and it rocks."
5,AMAZING,"I love this CD. Everything about it is awesome. The way they can play each song differently and make them all amazing is truely a very rare gift that each one of the band members posess. Chris Conley's voice is like no other. He could sing at any pitch and make it sound beautiful, especially when he sings his awesome metophorical lyrics. Once you really think about them, and find the true meaning to the song, each one is golden. My favorite songs on the CD are ""At your funeral"", ""Nightingale"", and ""This is not an exit"". Each one of them really compliment Conley's voice. I highly reccomend this CD to anyone."
3,eh. too emo.,"well, ive got all of saves the day's cds including their demo tape, and until this cd ive always thought they rock. prior to this release, they were kind of punk indie emo, which was a nice mix and they had a really unique style. chris's amazing vocals and lyrics helped too. but this cd totally let me down. the vocals are good obviously becuase chris is good, and the lyrics are different than their other stuff but theyre definitely not bad. but this one doesnt have the fun, energetic, catchyness of their previous albums. its too indie, too emo. i guess if thats what you're into maybe you'll like it, but its a lot slower and it sounds a lot like every other cd by any emo band ever. if you liked saves the day's earlier stuff but arent really a big indie or emo fan, dont buy this. ill listen to it a couple more times maybe, and try to give it another chance, but through being cool and cant slow down are WAY WAY WAY better so go buy those!!"
4,Saves the Day does it again,"This album is great. The lyrics by vocalist Chris Connelly are awesome and heartfelt just as they were in their last CD ""Through being Cool."" This is much softer than their first album ""Can't Slow Down"" but a little different than their other releases. It's basically amazing emo-core with an edge. I have to say it's just as good if not better than their last release."
1,Stay Away From This!,"I have extensive experience with wireless system setup and operation. My whole system is all Linksys gear. After four hours on this camera, I give up.When you update the firmware, it erases everything you programmed into the camera so beware.I could get the camera to work in WiFi mode. Picture is decent, not great. The motion sensing function triggers quite well.The frustration comes from an inability to get the email function to work. Kept getting an error message with the system parameters setup so it should have worked.The FAQ section on Linksys website is almost non-existent. I did not bother to call because in my past experience that is of minimal help and very frustrating.Features sound great but could not get it to work right. I will find another unit."
2,Network Nightmare,"The camera is plagued by frequent lock-ups. It is unable to renew IP addresses when in DHCP mode and does not acknowlege static IP address changes. I had to reset the camera 3 times to default. After reset it is accessible by the .115 address. I was able to get the device working on a couple of occasions, including port forwarding features through a linux firewall. However, if you do get this camera up and running, I don't recommend shutting it off. Technical support was very helpful in telling me how to open the box."
1,EXTREMELY FRUSTRATING,"I purchased this thinking I could hook it up in less than an hour like most devices I have (and I have many) but nothing has gone right. I am now at MONTH TWO futzing with it - yes I tried support, yes I tried community forums, and still won't allow me to use the worthless subscription to Sololink.RUN RUN FAST away from buying this product."
4,Another great product by Linksys,"The set up literally took less than 5 minutes, as long as you can follow simple instructions, set up is a breeze. Image quality is good for VGA, can't expect too much there. If this camera had portable power too then it would be perfect!"
3,"Good Guitar, Fantastic Price","This was my first guitar and for the price, it blows any other Strat copy away. But that is not to say it is without it's problems; fret buzz is a bit of a problem and is diffucult to solve even by raising the action and adjusting the truss rod, the lower tone pot is useless but this is case on most inexpensive guitars of this style, and finally the guitar has trouble staying in tune, this can be solved by adding locking tuners or if your are gung-ho about this axe a locking tremolo. The pickups sound great, the guitar is not that heavy, and the finish (mine was sunburst) was beautiful, if you are looking for a first guitar, overlook the Squiers and other cheap guitars and cut your teeth on this axe."
4,Sturdy and they do NOT stick up above the speakers.,I have these brackets also and they do not stick up above the speaker as one reviewer has stated. If you read and follow the directions included with them then they will not stick up above your speakers. I installed them myself and they are somewhere around the middle of the speaker in the back. There is no way in the world that you can say that they stick up above the speaker unless you did not follow the included directions.
3,Very sensitive,"My children love the little people however this is the most aggravating toy we have. I love the farm and the animals but it moos all the time. No on will be near it and it will start mooing. We only have a problem with the cow sound going off randomly. We also have had a problem with the end piece by the pig falling off. The piece doesn't like to stay on. We do like this toy, I just wonder if the new one stops these problems."
1,Incorrect item sent,"Based on the description and photo the wrong item was shipped to us. The item shipped didn't have our condo number on the address along with no return address, so it sat in our condo building entryway for a week. It was also a used toy that had cement in the bottom of the animals. The items were thrown in a box without any packaging and the box they were sent in was too small and packaging tape held it together somehow."
4,Not what I expected from Fisher Price...,"My son received this farm as a gift. It is cute, but he doesn't seem as interested in it as I thought he would be. Also, shortly after he received it, a small piece broke off the bottom of the windmill - just the right size to be a serious choking hazard. I really didn't expect this from a Fisher Price toy. I took the windmill away, and he still plays with the rest of it."
2,This is not worth the money,The game is not worth your money. My sister got it for her 9th birthday and we both hate it. On the commercial it shows everyone dancing differently and having fun. But the game is very hard because the colors are called out very fast and the voices are so annoying. This is just my opinion so get it if you want to.
1,Don't Waste Your Money!,"My 8 yr old wanted this so badly for Xmas. She is a dancer and found this game to be just plain dumb. You have 2 voices shouting moves at you - the man's voice is for the left side of your body, and the woman's voice is for the right side of the body. Well they are both going 'green, green, red,blue, yellow yellow, green,etc...' and its just plain confusing. The cd starts from easy to hard, but after about 15 mins of it, it just becomes boring and annoying. This one is a dud! Don't waste your money on it!"
3,"Torchwood, this is Terra Nova. Terra Nova, meet Torchwood.","This show is okay...3 stars. But I really can't get past the Torchwood ""...creatures falling through the crack and threatening humans..."" parallel. The dinosaurs are pretty convincing, and I thought my son would dig the show, but he can't understand Cutter's accent (although I find it charming).The whole ""Let's go through the portal to study the primordial oooze,"" is a bit too Terra Nova. The missing wife angst got old real fast; for whatever reason, the tortured scientist didn't make me care about his grief.TW and TN are shows I enjoy, but their love child, Primeval, doesn't do it for me. It's just okay."
2,Ok.,"Acting is horrible, Cinematics are horrid! In this age of technology i cant believe they couldn't make the dino's a little more realistic. If your looking for an obviously low- budget product then you will love this. Storyline is ok... A little monotonous after first few episodes, twists are predictable. I was waiting for the plot to get better, and I suppose it could in the next few seasons,but... At least there is plenty of room for improvement!"
4,Primeval: Volume 1 (Series 1 and 2),"This is one of the Brits series you don't want to miss if you enjoy SciFi. It's a cross between ""Jurassic Park"" and ""A Sound of Thunder"". A team must recover creatures from the past and future as they come through a portal into present day England. Great cast, stories, and effects make this one series I wished I had caught from the start. It was exciting to watch them try to determine how to capture and return creatures. Scientific and Witty, you will be engaged in the acting and stories. I got into the series after it started and what I saw I loved so I'm buying the DVDs. Good quality DVDs with plenty of replayability. If you enjoyed this catchDoctor Who: The Complete Fourth Series.CA Luster"
4,"Requires your indulgence , but worth your time","If you know other British TV SciFi shows then this will feel quite familiar. It's got that odd hokey quality about it, amiable but not quite as confident as it wants to be. Some of the writing is just daft, with clunky exposition and characters behaving like plot functions rather than rational human beings. Having said all that the Monster work is great and it all rattles along quite enjoyably. The 2nd season/half is noticeably tighter and I'm looking forward to a new season."
2,Sadly dull and childish,"Was hoping for the quality and writing found on other BBC America series.....is not there. Dr. Who, Torchwood, etc are phenominal. This one falls seriously short."
1,So So,"Bought it, Watched the first CD and decided the library would be a better use of the rest. Won't buy any more."
1,Not happy,"I had this for my sister birthday but some of the keyholders does not work right, i had reveived some complaints about the item."
3,Another pop princess in the making...,"Despite poppy sounds reminiscent of Britney Spears, Willa Ford's ""I Wanna Be Bad"" shot up the Billboard charts last month, with an infectious theme sure to please all teeny-boppers: ""You make bad look so good/ I've got things on my mind/ I never thought I would/ I I wanna be bad/ You make bad feel so good/ I'm losing all my cool/ I'm about to break the rules/ 'Cause I I wanna be bad."" The rest of the CD isn't bad either."
2,"Willa, you don't have to wanna be bad, you already are!","I kinda like the song "" I wanna be bad"" but the Genie gave her wish for the rest of the albulm. Thank goodness I didn't actually buy this bland velveta pop. . .it's not even good pop music like 'Nsync, Mandy Moore, Jessica Simpson, or Christina Aguilera. In fact, sadly to say, after hearing this albulm , I have more respect for Britney Spears. Shocking . . .I know."
1,I Wanna Laugh,"I think this is worse than her last ablum ""oops I did It Again"", oh wait I thought this was Britney. The song sound like Britney and she looks like Britney. Thats so wierd, anyways don't get this CD unless u love Britney!"
1,"Oh Goodie, Another CD Coaster!","If there had been an option for 0 stars, believe me, that would've been my first choice. As if the music industry isn't already saturated enough with wannabe pop stars. So what if she write her own lyrics? The thing is, are they any good? It's just sad that what they're doing these days is taking relatively decent looking people, sprucing them up with layers of make-up, airbrushing the album covers and THEN chucking them pre-packaged music.Horrible.It's obvious Miss Ford is trying to cash in on the sex factor, which in my opinion somewhat misses the mark and lands squarely on ""trashy."" So it worked for Britney (God knows why) but poor Willa isn't fortunate enough. She's not all bad. Maybe if she had some proper training and focused less on her tarty image, she might someday churn out something listenable.Maybe."
3,Not that I sympathize with Brittney Spears or anything...,"...but frankly, I don't see what the big honking difference is with Willa Was Here. It covers territory (love, breakups, jealousy, etc.) that's already been done to death by a slew of R&B singers, and I didn't care much for it even then. Her writing all the songs just proves that one uncreative mind is no different from any other.Nevertheless, this isn't a bad effort, especially for a debut album. It's perfectly acceptable lightweight fare, and I find Ms. Ford vastly easier on the ears than Whitney Houston and all her imitators. Just don't anyone kid themslves: She's from the same cloth as Brittney...just not as successful and a little more talented."
1,Liar,"On one song on the cd she ""sings"" about how tired of people comparing her to Britney, but i don't blame them. This album is totally un original and why did she change her name from Amanda Williford to Willa Ford. I mean she obviously made up her name up from her last name."
4,Clara's Star,"For those looking for more music from ""Clara's Star"" look under the name Seven and the Sun. I'm not sure why the name change but it's the same group :)"
3,"Have I changed, or has this candy?","This has been my favorite candy bar for fifty years (!), and is hard to find in stores - all the trendy new varieties have edged it out. So I order it by mail, and have continued to like it, but the latest box (Jan, 2013) didn't live up to my expectations. Have they changed the recipe, or have my tastes changed? Not sure. Still OK, but just not as good as it used to be."
4,WinTV card,"Would rate well based on price, not perfect picture quality, but worked out great for our application, my daughter was at college with no TV. I had this shipped direct to her, she installed it and with a little coaching over the phone we had it working. Her pc is a 2.8 ghz Dell dimension 3000 W/ 512 meg ram. Works great, she loves it."
1,other book is better,"OK but not great. His other book, The Dreams of Donald Roller Wilson, has his best work (which is incredible!) and is much cheaper. This one is all about the monkey portraits."
3,This is a Documentary,"This is a documentary with interviews from the original cast and a good description of the history of the Electric Company. This is, however, not something that will be easy or as fun to watch for your children, since only a few of the Electric Company skits are actually shown between the various interviews.Buy this if you want to learn the history of the show and watched it as a child. Don't buy this if you want your kids to enjoy it with you."
5,:),"I have read all of Victoria Holts books and this is by far the best! The story is very captivating and you will neaver EVER guess what the seacret that Chrispin has is, or that it is conected to the murder! I would definitly by this book! Victoria Holt is my favorite auther. The books of hers I would by are:1. Seven for a Seacret2. The Shivering Sands3. Mistress of Mellyn"
4,Nice album but shiny pages,We have a similar soft album that the pages aren't quite so shiny. It's not a big deal but I notice it when looking at the photos. Mainly my 1yr old just loves to see herself and chew on the album cover.
2,Button does not stay on,The doorbell was okay fairly easy to install until I inserted the button in the turtle and it popped right back out. The wires were pushing on the button. There is very little holding the button in.
4,IQ,This game is very hard to find. My son and I have wanted this game since we played the demo disc on Playstation 1. He is getting it for Christmas this year and he is going to be very surprized. Im so excited to see how shocked he is going to be.
4,Shocking Shockers,"WOW! If you like super sour candy and wanted to SHOCKED try Shockers. They are very much like chewy Spree candies, if you are familiar with those, but about ten times more sour. It really is a shocking sour taste and if you like that, then this candy is for you."
2,Sundered Grammar,"When a chapter is titled ""Dissention"" (sic), you know the editor is asleep at the switch. There are unfortunately more instances of bad grammar, as well as a quote from The Empire Strikes Back that take this from an average dungeon crawl to less than average.We have three returning characters, Devis the half-elf Bard, Vadania the druid and Lidda the halfing rogue. Vadania and Lidda are uncharacteristically besotted with Devis though they are both experienced enough to know better, particularly Vadania. Tordek a dwarven fighter is the new iconic addition and Vadania is given a wolverine companion.That being said, the actual adventure is fairly good. Some really powerful enemies and enchanted weapons with a satisfying ending. It is really too bad that this series suffers from an editor who shows such disregard to the readers by allowing such continuity and basic english mistakes."
4,We got what we thought we would.,"Being senior citizens, my wife and I find it difficult to exist in this IT world.I have a digital camera, but Ann still stumbles along with her film camera.Locally we find it hard to find film for cameras in stores, so she ordered some on-line; it came, and she's most satisfied."
1,Film,"Let's try this , I loved receiving items not as described, it saves me the trouble of opening the manifactor sealed film myself, and who needs to see the factory expiration date anyway. I sure the outdated film will be just great. Now will this review get posted? Avoid buying any APS film from this or any other seller, it's all outdated , that's why they show you sealed film in their listing but you will receive opned cans of film removed from factory packaging to remove expiration date."
1,A review,"I think I threw it out already! No instructions for use, no clasp to open the watch, or if there is, I couldn't find it."
5,One of my favourite albums.,This is one of my favourite albums !I bought it on LP-vinyl i Germany in 1967 !It was only released in Germany !
2,.,The story isn't bad but Robinson's writing style isn't fitting for me. I checked my nails more times than she used vowels.
2,"upside down and backwards, but still a good book","The first 74 pages of the book were bound upside down and backwards. I'm keeping it though because I don't want to go through sending and receiving again, and I can read it."
2,Over 300 blank pages for the price of a book!,"The ""Finding Your Soul Mate Journal"" is essentially 372 blank and mostly blank pages. You get:Pages 1 and 2 - Title page and publishing information.Pages 3 and 5 - Introduction telling you the journal is based on the ""Four Rivers of Life"" by Angeles Arrien, and why journaling is helpful.Page 6 (and all even pages thereafter) - 23 blank lines for writing.Page 7 (and all odd pages thereafter) - The page is split into 4 questions, each with 4 blank lines underneath for your answer: What inspired me? What challenged me? What surprised me? What deeply touched me?That's it. Essentially a blank book. Admittedly, I bought this journal sight-unseen without the benefit of any reviews, and feel ripped off. These are great questions to journal about, but I would have preferred for Evelyn Rice to simply have give these journaling instructions in her ""Finding Your Soul Mate Handbook"". There's no need to pay the full price of a book for blank pages."
4,Good Idea,"I bought this for my 17 month old daughter for Christmas and she loves it .We gave it to her early because she was sick with the flu and we wanted something to cheer her up , this sure did she plays with it all the time ,so do her 5 and 6 year old brothers ."
4,Good First Dollhouse,"I like this product as a little girls first dollhouse. My daughter has played with it several times over the last year. We have added to her set by getting her the Garage for all of her cars and she plays with that alot, too. When I was a little girl, I played with my Little People Dollhouse for hours at a time and now watching my daughter play with her interactive sounds dollhouse is an enjoyable experience. I recommend this product to parents."
5,Sweet Sounds Home,"My mother bought this for my daughter on her first birthday and she absolutely loves it! She will spend an hour opening the door and pushing all of the buttons to make the sounds. It is great to have a toy for her that she loves so much now, and can play with for a fw more years. She liked it so much I went out and bought her the fisher price barn for christmas!"
1,is this price right?,Fisher Price is selling the same item for only $33. $139.99 has to be a mistake!
4,Are they serious about this price?!,"I just bought this very same house at Target for 19.99! I have not been able to find this at any other store, most carry the older version. So has the pricing been raised because of demand or what? It's a really fun toy for my son, but I would never pay that much for this! ($89 as of this post)"
3,Psychic Vampires,This book got only a 3 stars because even though it gave some good insight and how to protect our self from many types of energy sucking Vampires it just didnt have enough to keep me glued to the book.
1,Two pictured one shipped - very misleading,"As you can see in the picture, there are two stands. Typically people have two speakers too - in fact it is hard to buy 1 speaker but very easy to buy one stand. This is a classic bait and switch misrepresentation. Very disappointed this should be not allowed. Even the description says ""pedestals"" - meaning plural!!!"
5,Excellent value,"Pedestals matched perfectly with my speakers. When matched with excellent price and received in excellent condition, you have a great deal!"
3,The Jerry Seinfeld of American Poetry,"Collins is funny, I'll grant him that. The problem with his work is that he doesn't know how to write a poem that is serious. Everything's a joke to him. And the humor in Collins' poetry is very similar to Jerry Seinfeld's stand-up comedy routines. ""So what's the deal with airline peanuts?"" kind of humor.Okay, Collins may be funnier than that. But you get the idea. The humor is always Seinfeldian in that it involves poking fun at mundane, everyday life experiences or at poetic conventions. And while this is definitely amusing, over the course of a book, it can make for a pretty superficial reading experience. Most of us don't want our poets to be constant jokers. And although having a sense of humor is always good to a certain extent, I want my favorite poets to do more than just make me giggle at life's oddities or simple pleasures.Collins is fine for a light read, but he's not a poet you'll turn to for any kind of depth or challenge."
4,Poetry for those who aren't big on poetry,"Do you know someone who claims to hate all poetry but you desperately want to prove them wrong? Pick up this book for them. Billy Collins writes about every day life in a poetic but totally accessible way and often humorous way.I think my favorite in this collection is ""On Turning Ten"" which is about turning ten years old but from the perspective of a ten year old who feels turning ten is turning very very old. Trust me its funny and makes you think about the last time you thought you were turning ""old"".Not every single poem is ""funny"" per se either so if you are looking for some more serious themes and tone, you can find that as well but still in the easy to read style that Collins has in all his work."
1,Boring Boring Boring,"Having lived in Israel for 4 years I anticipated a novel with insight into the Israeli Psyche. All I got was a 3rd rate thriller, with no thrills and much tedious prose."
3,Director. What would you risk to be famous?,Its a different topic for an independent film. What can we do for money and to reach our dreams. Which are our options when all the doors are closed.Good movie*sponsored post
2,Would not Buy Again,"Packaging, shipping, etc was all fine. I'm just not a big fan of the gels. I very much prefer the Honey Stinger chews. I would not buy again."
4,Good but only 90 calories,"These products seem to do as advertised, and the vanilla gel tastes pretty good. I did not give it 5 stars, though, because they are only 90 calories a package. If I'm doing 20 mph on a bike I'm burning well over 1000 calories an hour, which means I'll burn thru 90 calories in about 4 or 5 mins. Given that the hassle factor of getting one of these out of you back pocket, tearing it open, consuming it, storing the empty, and then chasing it with water takes about 2 mins I've already burned up much of what I sucked out of the pouch. So I tend to prefer the PowerBar gels because those packets are 110 or 120 calories. I don't think they taste any better (or worse) and I can't make any argument about one being better than the other from a sports nutrition perspective. My assumption is that they are equally effective, so my view is that more is better. Therefor only 90 calories per pouch is a big drawback of the Hammer products."
1,Continuous humming sound,"Voice quality is very poor, hear continuous background noise. Called Vonage customer service, the rep picked up after 30 min and told me to connect the phone to port 2 on the router and hung up stating that he will call back. Nobody called, I called back and was agian on the the phone waiting ... waiting .. waiting..."
3,"Router OK, Vonage Phone Service Great, Vonage tech support poor","I confirm that a simply power surge seems to damage these routers; I am now having to buy a 2nd because of this. When the service is running without technical difficulties this is a superb product giving you the ability to control your phone service via the web.BUT if you run into technical difficulties and are forwarded to India for tech support, expect to be on the phone a long time due to the language problem. I was run through several steps, with lots of ""excuse me could you repeat that"" from both ends, very frustrating."
3,Old times!,"Sometimes you have to go back and see if memory serves you well. This time I got exactly what I remembered so fondly from back in the days of PS1 FPS yore. I'm hanging on to Tenka for keeps this time. I betcha I'll wanna relive it again at some future time when everyone else is wearing 3d, virtual world headsets."
2,DEAR FOLKS,"Dear folks, Kai Hansen was the brain in Helloween. After he left, the band was history. Led by heartless guitarrist Michael Weikath, they never accomplished anything good again, their drummer died, and they released a series of bad albuns. Sad."
5,Most Difficult Final Fantasy,"Definitely one of the better strategy RPG's I've played, but still difficult. Not as difficult as the Disgaea strategy RPG series (THANKFULLY), but still pretty hard. The plot and the ""Job"" system are very deep though and will definitely keep a lot of players busy. Highly recommended."
5,great game,"good gameplay, awesome story, interesting tactical battle layout and execution, overall a very good game worth many hours of gameplay!"
3,New Gamers May Be Dissapointed,"Im not sure what to really say about this game. I love the Final Fantasy Games to death. (Final Fantasy IX is my favorite). But in this game i find the battle system and graphics really distracting. I know that in the long run you can really enjoy this game, but if your really into the games ff7-10, this is a big step down."
1,crappy game,"hey remember me!? thats right im the preppy girl that rated final fantasy 8. anyway im rating final fantasy tactics the crappiest game on the face of the earth. like i said im not a pro gamer, but this game was really unfair and stupid. sometimes you have to fight 4 against 7 , and your taem being the small number. i raelly liked this game in the beginning but after a while the style of fighting became long , boring and montonos. i playedd final fantasy 8 first and maybe im used to the fancy stuff , but one thing is for sure this game has a craappy storyline crappy graphics, crappy game play crappy sound and horrible characters , there are so many!! how do you keep track!! this game has no cute guys and really friuty names at first i thought ramza was a freakin' girl, as soon as i read the character bois in the book i saw the word him under his name. of coarse this is my opinion and you dont have to agree but dont spend your dough on this piece of crap."
5,Puts other FF titles to shame,"This game puts every other FF title to shame in terms of gameplay. The square-based battlefields, different attack/move/jump ranges make you plan out your battles. It's a far cry from games like FF7/8/10 where you could get by just attacking constantly, or could give everyone any magic spell you wanted (FF8, anyone?).The story isn't as long as other games, but the battles are LONG. Some are 30-45 minutes. In fact, it's like every battle is a boss fight!If you enjoyed the job system from FF5, and you enjoyed the position-based fighting in Chrono Trigger, then this is a great game to try. 20 jobs for your characters means there is a LOT of replay value."
5,"Tough to get a handle on, but a lot of fun","The game is a bit hard to get used to. The movement and magic sequences tend to get confusing and slow. However, after a few hours of playing the game, you'll have all the basics down and better yet, you'll love playing this game. I can't express how much fun I have had playing the game. I actually sold it, being the fool that i am, but now I am going to buy it again just so i can relive the storyline."
5,Shadow Of the Sentinel,The most incredible read of the last 30 years!! Eye opening. You will find yourself telling total strangers about it. This story needs needs to be in a Ken Burns special.
4,Very Good Large Screen HDTV,"I bought this HDTV online about 2 weeks ago and am very satisfied, overall, and amazed about the picture provided by this large screen TV. Setup was very easy, given the multiple choices provided by the large number of input options.My only negative, so far, is the mediocre sound system. Admittedly, I have not tried, yet, to play with the sound adjustment options (bass, treble, etc.). Instead I added a home theater system and, for the most part, use it for my sound.Overall, for the price, I would rate this a must have for those seeking a very large screen 1080p HDTV."
1,Model Powers off by Itself!,Model powers off by itself every day. Takes 4 minutes to get it back on! Do not buy any tv that is not internet ready to get firmware updates to fix glitches like this!
3,A little slow,This dvd is good for beginners. A little slow for me. I need a much faster pace total body workout
1,Fabric is weak and tore within first week of use,"I thought this would be a good product when I read the other reviews, however, the ends of the hanger ripped through the canvas within days of using it. I was very disappointed because I had another clothespin holder for about 6 years that was made of denim and really just faded, I wouldn't buy this product, save your money, use a bucket with a handle, you'd be better off!! The only reason I gave it one star is I couldn't post the opinion without selecting a star...."
4,Been looking for a long time,Good quality. Hard to find item in local stores. I was replacing an older model that just wore out. Guess not too many people still hang out their clothes to dry.
4,"Good book, a bit one-sided perhaps","It seems that not all of our enlisted seem to think this war is something we should be continuing, although this book would have you believe otherwise.It is a very good book, albeit a little one-sided."
3,it work okay,it work okay but my congestion was so bad i still needed prescription. so the product didn't work g=for me
3,Save ur $$ - Just use the bottle,"I bought this product in hopes it would help prevent my recurrent sinus infections more than the Neilmed sinus rinse bottle I had. I wish I had saved the $90. It doesnt seem to be any more effective and is now sitting on the shelf in my closet.As an aside- the machine does function as described. I just prefer the rinse bottle because it's easier, no special flushing, etc."
4,Works as advertised,"Works well for nasal irrigation, Has held up for 2 months so far. The throat irrigation has not been helpful but not what I bought it for anyway.does not seem particularly durable but so far so good."
2,sinus issues,"didn""t work for me still have sinus issues,thought this was the answer for my post nasal drip. hope you find this helpful."
5,The best!,"We have been using this for four years. The best for sinus prevention and it also help with allergies. It is very easy to use and is very gentle on you. My whole family uses it!My 6 year old (four years ago) has seasonal allergies. Living in Texas, she often suffers from pollen ""attacks"". Her pediatrician put her on allergies medication year round. However, ever since we had this irrigator, when it is allergy season, we would let her use it once in the morning after she gets up, and once at night before bed. Her symptoms (running nose, sniffling, sneezing, etc.) have decreased significantly. She (now at age 10) has not needed medication at all since she started using the irrigator. We are totally sold on this!"
1,THIS IS FOR 1 BOTTLE - NOT FOR 6 BOTTLES,"This is for 1 liter of Pentosin 11S. I thought I was getting a 6 bottle package based on the other user's comments, but I received only 1 bottle. When I called Car Part Kings, they told me that Amazon has the wrong description and it is for a SINGLE 1 lieter bottle."
2,"Stale, and not worth it.","I really tried to like these, but the were so hard and stale, I couldn't recommend these to anyone. My gums are sore from trying to massage this candy into a chewable state. I've been a fan of flavored tootsie rolls forever, but I'll just stick to the factory sealed assorted bags from now on."
5,Positive review,Item came in fine shape and as advertised. We still have to install it in our computer.
4,Great tuner but read fine print regarding remote,"I just received this tuner several days ago and it works great. Although this isn't the ""Media Center Edition (MCE) "" version, it is very compatible and allows me to watch TV through MCE along with all of the other features available through MCE (pause and record live tv, transfer to disc etc..) The only problem is that the remote is not compatible with MCE. I didn't read everything thoroughly and should have ordered the MCE kit that comes with a MCE certified remote. I don't want to be stuck with a remote that doesn't work. I was going to keep this tuner and just order a new MCE certified remote separately but the remote itself runs for a min of $40. So, I'm sending this tuner/remote back and ordering the WINTV-PVR-150 MCE Bundle which comes with the MCE remote and also has an FM tuner."
2,Picture quality poor compared to PVR-350,I purchased this card as a second tuner for my MythTV DVR. The capture picture quality is poor compared to the PVR-350. I would highly recommend spending the additional money for the PVR-350.
1,Did not arrive inside original Kodak package as shown,Did not arrive inside original Kodak package as shown - just 3 loose rolls of film with no expiration dates on them. No doubt the expiration date was on the original packaging.
1,The film stock was old.,"I just got my pictures back from christmas that I took on this film and they were all foggy. When I received the film I first checked for an expiration date on it and didn't find one. I have had this camera for years and never had a problem like this before. If you order, try checking for an expiration date."
5,Nothing like it,"Let me put my 2 cents in real quick. I just went through the entire album, my sister has been trying to get me to for a while. Let me just say that this is never coming out of my CD player for a LONG time. Each song beautifully transistions to the next, and... it's hard to explain the emotions you get, its something you have to experience yourself. This is a music lovers cd, go and get it."
3,easy,i ain't tellen where it came from.I have this product and it is pretty good it holds a hell of alot more then a standered. it outtmickly formates the item.i reccomend it if you get any kind of playstation.
1,MIssing the Figures and Equations from Several Chapters,"This would be a great book if they actually included the Figures and Equations. Everyone seems to be waiting for the developers to issue an update. So be warned, if you need this material the current kindle version is a very poor representation of the actual text."
4,Good Reference Book,"As a first year medical physics graduate student, this book seems to be a good reference book. It covers many topics related to radiation, though not any one in much depth. Some chapters are difficult to understand without suitable background in biology, especially molecular biology. It seems like a good review of current information on the topic, and also provides a list of sources for each topic for further research ."
2,Not what they used to be.....,"Poor quality on the last set I bought. The collar on the key stripped which made removal a pain. FYI, if you drive a tapered socket on the locks, they are easy to remove......"
3,McGard wheel locks,The wheel locks were identical to the one carried in the auto stores. They are chrome high quality locks. I am completely satisfied with the product and delivery was prompt.
3,I must be a little naive...,"I was not familiar with John Randolf Price before buying this CD and if I had known what I was buying I would have passed. No where on the front cover or on his book ""The Abundance Book"" does it tell you that it is a scripture based program. I was taken a little by surprise with all of the bible references and call me naive but I was not expecting that. I listened to the CD a couple of times and there are some good ideas but with so much bible reference it was not really for me. None of the printed material pointed to the content being scripture based and personally I think it should have been presented in a more straightforward way on the packaging."
5,My little pink friend,"I had one of these for many years that finally stopped working when I dropped it one time too many. I searched the web for a similar one and was thrilled when I found the same one as my little pink friend. It is compact, easy to use, travels well, and is perfect for between manicures touch-ups!"
5,The Original And Still The Best,"If you order a pound of Tootsie Rolls you're in for a treat. Last Halloween I ordered 12 for the different Trick or Treaters in my neighborhood and filled a large pumpkin with the bitesize treats. Would you believe it, the kids ran me out of 12 full pounds! I suspect that some of them doubled back to my doorbell once they saw the quality of goodies I was handing out. Don't worry, I kept a few for myself too. Because as long as you're a kid at heart, you'll keep your yen for America's original candy, Tootsie Rolls, the treat so tasty they named a movie after it.You don't need to give them any special treatment. They will keep in a candy dish in your apartment or home, or they can be safely and easily stored in cupboard or freezer. Warning, don't try to give them to your cat, I have heard that they are not too good for our feline friends."
3,classic backgammon board,"Its a great price for a great looking game board, but you can't fold it and its quite heavy too. Its looks good but thats it."
1,much cheaper for the same quality bag elcewhere on Amazon.,"I received my bag yesterday from Adorama. Mine was said to be a manfrotto bag but it didn't say so. I payed for a Bogen bag. It must be one right? In the end of the bag it says, MADE IN CHINA on a little tag. I payed over [...] for This Bag ""when you include shipping"", What I received is no better than the 10.79 tripod bag thats sold elcewhere on amazon with the same features. come on people, [...] for a lightly padded bag with a cheep zipper and no shoulder padding? I think its a ripoff!Look at the other 35"" Tripod bags on amazon and you'll find one much cheeper with the same Quality. Don't get ripped off like I did."
4,Good bag that fits my Manfrotto tripod and head,"Reviewers ZTT Fan and N. Barilka have complained that this bag is too small to accomodate their tripod/head combinations. I suppose that some detail must be paid to the specific combinations that will fit into this bag. MyManfrotto 055CXPRO3 Carbon Fiber 3 Section Tripod with Q90 Column and Magnesium Castings (Black)andManfrotto 488RC2 Midi Ball Head with RC2 Rapid Connect System (3157N)fit just fine in this bag. However, they do not fit into theManfrotto AW 3279BLK Padded Tripod Bag for 190X, 055X, and 3000 Series Tripods (Black)because that bag is too short."
3,so-so...,"After reading the plot outline, I was really looking forward to this book, but it kind of fell flat for me. I thought it was mediocre, despite one very interesting scene with peaches. I liked the hero and I loved the fact that he had a legitimate problem with no magical fix and the heroine was able to love him in spite of it. But it didn't live up to its potential.Also note, this is NOT a paranormal romance. It's more of a gothic romance."
2,Cute but poorly quality,I bought this for my children ages 2 and 8 months. I think it's very cute and I love the concept of them having their own pictures to look at instead of being supervised looking at adult albums. My issue is with the quality of this item. It's so poorly made that I doubt it will survive 2 small children. There are unraveling threads and the seams look as if a child stitched the album themselves. I needed it for a Christmas gift or I'd return it. My kids won't notice but I feel disappointed with this product overall.
3,Works well,"12 photos fit tightly yet are held fairly securely, probably due to the tight fit. Trying to put the cover page photo in was a little difficult."
2,A Deceiving Product -,"I ordered the album for my daughter's Valentine's gift. It is fun to carry but you can only fit into 10 photos. It was quite deceiving to sell a photo album at this price but not many photos can be included. From the picture shown at Amazon, I thought it would fit at least 30 some photos. My daughter would like to bring the album to school for show and tell about her trip in the winter break. We had to choose 10 photos out of 200+ photos to fit them into the album. I would not buy this type of photo albums."
4,Thailand is an amazing place for anyone,"I was amazed over all the different places this travel DVD takes you to, even to the golden triangle in the north. A really beautiful journey into the world of Thai, it gives some good insights on where to go. I recommend this one to anyone visiting Thailand for the first time or any one who would like to keep a great memory of Thailand."
3,Not for Doc Ford Fans.,"Having just finished reading ""The Heat islands"", I was looking forward to tagging along with Doc Ford on another detective adventure.Well, even though the Doc starts out strong, he quickly fades to a secondary character.The book is funny, and is evocative of the ""Florida lost"" ala John D. MacDonald and Carl Hiaasen. I'm probably a little too critical because I was expecting a variation on a theme and didn't get it"
3,elegy for a lost Florida,"This installment of the Doc Ford series takes a while to get going. Doc, the ex-NSA agent turned marine biologist, takes a supporting role here. The main character is Doc's eccentric Uncle Tucker, a lovable scoundrel who thinks he has discovered the Fountain of Youth on his property. Tucker is a sort of Florida Zelig, having been on hand for everything from presidential visits to the discovery of innovations in shrimp fishing.The plot, which involves the state trying to take Tucker's land, is a contraption set up to occasion remembrances of a pre-developed Florida. Everyone except Doc and Tucker seems to be on the make, looking for an angle. Randy Wayne White clearly loves Florida, this and his other books resonate with a love of place. I recommend this funny, affectionate, labor of love. Not as much of a mystery as some of White's other books, but worth the time."
5,A New Classic,"This book is so much fun! One funny, clever poem after another with short explanations about the poetry thoughout this book makes this a blast to read and really easy to teach/learn from. I am a longtime admirer of Shel Silverstein's and my students love Jack Prelutsky. The book Mr. Cleary has delivered is of the same high quality as these two authors from which kids will recite poems aloud, having learned them with no assignment! From a cat who spends too much time on the internet (My Cat Bytes) to an uncle who prints money in his basement (as a result, the government has asked him to print license plates)this book is one smile after another."
4,Suck on This,"Seems like I always have something in my mouth: a toothpick, a mint. . .my foot. Yet for those of us with a combined oral fixation/sweet tooth, nothing (count 'em), nothing seems more satisfying and yummy than the delightful, original, TOOTSIE POP.Grape. Raspberry. Orange. Cherry. Delectable chocolate. All assorted flavors blaze trails of zesty taste over your tongue; all of them end in a soft Tootsie Roll center payoff. I have acquired the discipline (though it's been hard) to hold off biting through the hard shell candy--to work the TOOTSIE POP down to its vulnerable chocolaty center--so that I may experience repeated Tootsie Nirvana. No other sucker offers such an experience, which is why TOOTSIE POPS (ASSORTED FLAVORS) are indeed the one and only. Go ahead. Pop one in your mouth today!--D. Mikels, Esq."
3,Need more info,"The product info is insufficient for deciding on a purchase. What does ""premium weight"" mean? Is it 8oz or 9oz? Do the pants have a drawstring? I know it's not a high margin product, but come on, you can do better."
1,"HORRIFYING FIT, HORRIBLE QUALITY!!!!!!!!!!!!!","I had several of these shipped to my Mum in law's in California for sending to me in France where we work and live. Because of a decent delivery speed, and her thinking they looked OK, I gave them a rating of 5 Stars.Today, after even having BOILED them in water, hoping for shrinkage, I am sad to say that nothing happened.They are horrid to wear, I oredered size small for all colours, and the fit is that of XXXXXXXL.DO NOT BUY THIS HORRORS. I wish I could get my hard earned money back, as now I'm wondering if I was the brunt of a joke in Nightmare Alley.You've got to be con artist to sell these things."
2,Good product but made my redness worse...,"This product smells fresh and has a nice consistency. I'm in my mid 30's, and my skin is getting more sensitive. I had read about this line of products and about how natural they are. I was hopeful that this cream would both moisturize and not irritate my skin, but my redness got worse over time and I had to stop using it. I'm still searching for that all natural product that won't irritate my skin."
5,An all-around fantastic moisturizer!,"I've always had issues with oily skin, so I was always told by dermatologists that I required a clarifying moisturizer of sorts (something with Salicylic Acid). My skin has never improved ... until THIS product! Not only has almost ALL of my oiliness disappeared, but my skin tone has evened out and I LOVE the feel of my skin! I'll never go without this product from here on out!"
2,Caused breakouts,I ordered this cream for my mom and myself. My mom said the first time she used it it made her skin tingle and after three days she had breakouts. After a week of using it her skin is now clear and she continues to use the cream. I on the other hand have stopped using it after a week as the breakouts got worse every day. The cream is non greasy but when I woke up in the morning I had little red bumps on my face which by evening were pimples.
2,Reviva Alpha Lipoic Cream,"I was very disappointed, I couldn't see it worked any better than cheaper creams. The cream I usually use worked as well."
1,It contains their hits in completely unknown and horrible versions. - Don't buy this CD,It contains their hits in completely unknown and horrible versions. - Don't buy this CDI don't recommend this CD because it is horrible and bad.- Better purchase another version of greatest hits
1,Counterfeit Part!,"A hand made box with a taped on label, holding a poorly made valve without an ACDelco sign, but only a ""NANMING"" on the cap. I brought it to several local GM dealers. Nobody has ever seen any ACDelco valve like this! The only conclusion can be drawn is: this is a counterfeit product."
3,Flawed but fun.,"Mike Mignola's HellBoy is one of those cool comic book creations that I look forward to on the semi regular basis that new material is published. Each new series is inventive and clever, some more than others. However.......this new novel by Christopher Golden, the second in a series, does not offer as much in the way of thrills as the comics do. It is a fun novel to read and contains many interesting ideas."
1,Doesn't fit newer Ventline,"Well, the advertising makes it sound as though it replaces all Ventline vent lids, but it really only fits Pre-'08 Ventlines. As you'll destroy the old lid getting it off you're left with a 14x14 hole in the roof of your RV and no way to fit this lid to the existing hardware."
5,Great for married couples too!,"After being married for nine years, I thought I knew everything about my husband. However, after reading this book and taking the quiz myself I found out things about my husband that were very enlightening. The discussion surrounding some of these issues helped us grow closer and we now have a deeper and renewed understanding of one another. It's a great book for us married couples too!"
5,Emu oil spray,Great stuff for dogs & cats with itchy skin. Sprays on easily. Price is fantastic. Overall a great relief for you and your pets.
5,Great for pets and humans too!,"I purchased this for my dogs per my veternarian's advice. Works great on my dogs! I have naturally curly hair that didn't have the ""spring"" that is used to have. Since it worked so well on my dogs I decided to give it a try on my own hair. It works better than any hair product that I have ever purchased! I give my hair just a few sprays while it is still wet and comb it through. Absolutely love it!"
1,BE ADVISED,Vonage did work well with a cable connection but at 512 DSL it stumbled. The worst part about Vonage is if you would like to conceal service (Which I did because I could not transfer my home number.) you will end up having to conceal the credit card you are having it billed to. I called customer service to cancel and the customer service person told me they will have a specialist call you to confirm a few things (I hope you get that call) mine came 3 days later and I missed it but had a nice voice mail telling me to call a number and ANYONE there can help. Called it and no one could help but they said they would have someone call me back and that never happened? So now I had to call my Credit card company to see what could be done and amazingly enough they have run into this before(with vonage)and suggested that I conceal the card and they would reissue me a new one. Also it took 5 months for the rebate to arrive.
2,Not worth it.,"Insufficient range to press pads back into caliper on my 05 Mercedes E55. I should mention that the pads weren't worn out; i was just taking the calipers off to swap the bearings. Therefore, the tool needed extra reach it wasn't designed for. Still, if you're going to make a purpose-built pad spreader, it needs to be made with this in mind. Instead i used two pry bars with backs up against one another. Worked great."
5,Monster MP HTS 1600 8-Outlet Power Center with Stage 2 Clean Power,came on time works great and packaging was very good. I am very happy with the product and the shipper.
2,Terrible value,"A couple years ago, I was in Costco and picked up a 3600 joule power strip. Famous name and $35.00 to buy. I got a deal."
5,HOLDIN IT DOWN FOR THE M-A,"first off, i wanna thank the hometown heroes (im from worcester)benzino delivers here with great beats and guest appearances. finally someone's puttin the 617 on tha map. it's about time someone from mass delivers. at first i wasn't too sure bout coppin the album, but now i love it and dont regret it all."
1,not even 1 star,"I just saw this [word] on rap city the bassment(rock the party ,video) this wannabe [is not very good] this what I mean when I say rap is goin down hill BIG TIME whats the point of this if you think this is good (hip-hop) music your odbviously brain washed by your television and radio."
1,Benzino is a sucka that cant rap,"After listening to this CD i decided to throw it in the garbage. He talks about eminem but he needs to take lessons from eminem and maybe he can learn how to rap. I cant believe they gave this guy a album. I write rhymes for fun and i know i could woop benzino in a rap battle any day. Eminem writes better rhymes than benzino. The fact that he tries to find trash on eminem makes him a sucka. He cant even rap so he tries to badmouth eminem. Dont hate fool, you a sucka and should go back to slangin crack oh i forgot you used to smoke it. They should rename him to benzero cause he would get zero stars if i could rate zero."
4,Temujin. A fantastic mystery!,I loved this game. The video clips and story line were superb. Interesting and challenging puzzles. Graphics were wonderful. Smooth play without computer glitches. I could play this one again.
4,just follow the advice....,"Following the advice of other reviewers, I played a full length DVD on AC power before charging and I've had no problems with the battery. Small, compact and gets the job done! The 'open' button (to remove a DVD) seems like it doesn't latch properly, but it's never popped open while playing so I guess it's OK."
5,very refreshing,"(i'm not actually a kid) I have been so sick of my friends telling me about their little emo bands and, from a sensible friend, i came across mates of state! HALLELUJAH!!! something that has sensible and understandable lyrics that sounds really good! ive made this cd as a present for all of my friends and i suggest it to almost everyone i meet! I can't wait for another!"
4,States of the Mates,"I have been to the Noise Pop Festival the past four years. Mates of States are one of those cool bands who always play at this festival in San Francisco. Mates of State moved to San Francisco from the Midwest in 1998. They have become a major force in the SF scene along with John Vanderslice. Mates of State are a duo who are named Kori Gardner and Jason Hammel. They are good songwriters and musicians, who sound a little like Polyphonic Spree and the like. It's shocking since there are two of them. There are three new songs. There is also a cover of ""Starman"" by David Bowie. Why they are releasing this EP after a few albums is beyond me. It is definitely a good short record. It makes me want to see them play live. I will shortly. They are touring with my favorite band, Smoosh."
2,GUSTER?!,"This movie featured two amazing songs by Guster (Rainy Day and What You Wish For, both on Lost and Gone Forever), and they really added to the depth of the movie, so I was thoroughly dissapointed not to find them on the sountrack! I have been a Guster fan since '97, and its too bad that this soundtrack wont provide Guster with some well-deserved exposure. For more Guster (and believe me, its all amazing) check out Lost and Gone Forever, Goldfly or Parachute! :-D Guster Forever!"
3,Score was good A real Soundtrack would have been better,I can't begin to repeat the sentiments of the many reviewers. Hopefully whomever was responsible for this so called soundtrack (really a score) takes note. I sometimes wish the people responsible would answer the complaints with this soundtrack. The movie was great and the music as many have mentioned was a huge part in this. THere is a song where the son is listening to his music outside at school next to the girl on the table. Does anyone know who that song is by and what it's called. Anyways though we were robbed of songs the score still brought somethings to the table. It felt at times though it was trying to emulate the American Beauty scores.
4,It was pretty good-but not great,"I would actually give this a 3.75. It had some really good songs like ""Survivor"", ""Never Had a Dream Come True"" and ""All For You."" It also had popular singers like 'N SYNC. I think, though, it should have been ""Pop"" by 'N SYNC instead of ""This I Promise You."" It wouldn't have hurt to have put Willa Ford's ""I Wanna Be Bad"" and Jessica Simpsons' ""Irresistable"" on the CD. I also believe they shouldn't have put ANY Britney Spears' songs on it. It's time for Ms. Spears to produce a new album! Maybe A*Teens will land in an upcoming ""Now"" CD. I think they're pretty good. Kyrstal Harris' ""Supergirl"" should've earned a spot in this CD, I think. Overall, the tracks were pretty good. I just think the CD should've been slightly more updated."
2,Not Bad,"Over all, not bad. With songs by Aerosmith, American Hi-Fi, and Lifehouse, youv'e got a few decent songs. If your more of a rock loving person, do'nt bother buying this CD. It has to much pop."
3,not what I expected,Yes......there are a few great songs on this CD but come on.......I was really disappointed with it because the majority of these songs came out earlier in the year.
3,where are the chart topping songs?,"I like most of the artist on this cd and most of the songs but I think there were many better songs they could have put on the cd. Nsync's ""This I promis you"" and Mystical's ""Danger"" are very old songs for this cd they should have been on the last Now cd. 3lw's ""Playas gon' play"" and Even and Jerin's "" From my head to my heart"" were not chart topping songs I'v only heard Even and Jerin's song twice on the radio. Another thing where was O-town's ""All or nothing"" Train's ""Drops from jupitor"" J-Lo and Ja Rule's "" I'm real"" or Lil' Romeo's ""My Baby"". Over all I enjoyed the cd but it could have been much better."
3,NOW- Chart Topping Hits?,"Since there is alot of confusion on if this volume has all the ""chart topping hits"" i compiled a list on the peak positions of these songs on the Billboard hot 100. hope this is helpful.1. Survivor - Destiny's Child- #2 for 7 weeks2. All for You - Janet Jackson- #1 for 7 weeks3. Baby Come on Over - Samantha Mumba #494. In My Pocket - Mandy Moore **DID NOT CHART5. Play - Jennifer Lopez #196. The Call (Remix) - Backstreet Boys #587. Playas Gon' Play - 3LW #828. Ride Wit Me - Nelly #39. Danger - Mystikal #1410. Fiesta - R. Kelly with Jay-Z #611. Let Me Blow Ya Mind - Eve #2 for 1 week12. What Would You Do - City High #813. Don't Let Me Be the Last - Britney **DID NOT CHART14. This I Promise You - N'Sync #515. Never Had a Dream... - S Club 7 #1016. Hanging By a Moment - Life House #217. Jaded - Aerosmith #718. From My Head to My Heart - E & J **DID NOT CHART19. Flavor of the Weak - American Hi-Fi #49Hope i was helpful!"
4,Most of the Best of the Year,"This is one album that you will play over and over again. Now 7 has put together the best of the year in na compliation that has something for everyone. From rap, pop, rock, and r&b Now 7 picked the hottest hits in each genre. I am more a pop fan so I was excited to have hits like In My Pocket-Mandy Moore, Samantha Mumbas Baby Come Over, This I Promise You-Nsync, and Never Had a Dream Come True-S Club 7. I do have all of these albums though so what I was really excited about was that I was able to get hits like Let Me Blow Ya Mind-Eve and Gwen Stefani, Hangin By a Moment-Lifehouse, and Jaded-Aerosmith. All excellent songs that I would not by a whole album for. I give props for Now 7 for creating such a diverse musical selection. One problem-so many songs that radio played the heck out of I wanted to skip-such as Survivor-Destiny's Child and Ride With Me-Nelly. But overall not one bad song on this collection."
4,"A Good ""Now"" CD....for once....","For once in my life, I was not disappointed with a ""Now"" CD. Now 7 has a wide variety of 2001's biggest hits, from Janet Jackson and ""All for You"" to Mystikal with ""Danger"". As usual, the CD had its high points (""Survivor"", ""Play"", ""Flavor of the Weak"") and its low points (""Danger"" and particulary the remix of ""The Call""- whatever happened to the original?), but overall, it was pretty good. Previous Now CDs have dissapointed me greatly for not giving a representation of ALL the hits of the year, but Now 7 strangely did not. How odd. Of course, I still think that you only need one Now CD a year, not seventeen, but if they are all like this one, I guess it wouldn't be so bad."
2,"Good, But.........","Just looking at some of the song titles, I can tell that there was certainly a bias towards the R&B crowd with this collection. However, why the heck was Evan and Jaron's ""From My Head To My Heart"" included?!? That song wasn't even on the radio here! Not the best collection they've had. However, I bought it because I have the previous six volumes."
3,"Ok CD,Not the best","...the best songs are ""Bootylicious"" by Destiny's Child,""A Little Bit"" by Jessica Simpson,""I'm A Believer"" by Smash Mouth,and ""U Got It Bad"" by Usher...Bye!"
3,Worst Now Yet,"This particular Now CD contains singles that are anything but recent. ""Walk On"" by U2? ""Bootylicious"" by Destiny's Child? These singles were released in the summer. It is now winter. Maybe the people at Now headquarters should get their act together and actually PUT RECENT SONGS ON THE ALBUM. Isn't that the whole point of the Now CD series anyway?"
4,This has something for everyone,"I think this CD is great and everyone should hear it. I read another review that gave ratings on all the songs and they gave 5 out of 5 to every single pop song and dissed all the rock songs. I like nearly any type of music and I think it is unfair for someone to tell you this is an average CD because they don't like half the songs because they are rap or rock or whatever. If you like any of the groups on this CD, you should give it a listen, but don't expect to like every song on the album."
4,Some Good Songs,"This CD is pretty good, but just the last tracks. Clint Eastwood, Start The Commotion, I'm a Believer, Fat Lip, Rock Show, Bad Day and Be Like That are all awesome songs (some of my favorites). But all the songs that start off this CD aren't as good. This CD has great songs on it and some annoying songs too."
3,Stop your whining you Pop Haters!!,"Ok, the new NOW cd is out. ... I like everything from Trance to Metal, Pop to Punk and everything in between. I like pop! So what? That doesn't mean I sold out to the system or am a sellout. I just like the way it sounds. Simple as that! Yes, the cd has songs on it that have been played 20 million times over. Does it make it a bad cd? Nope! ... The CD is a fun CD. It has singable lyrics and catchy beats. I'm Real should have been the Remix version but hey, it's still ok. ..."
2,Mediocre..,"If I were to buy a Now! CD, it would have to have a track listing with a bit more intelligent pop than the stuff that makes it on here.Put some singer-songwriters on it, jeez. (Pete Yorn, perhaps?)Throw a couple more rock songs on there that didn't destroy the pop chart (I could easily see ""The Middle"" by Jimmy Eat World fitting on one of these.)Throw some rap songs on there that don't suck.Don't top-load the CD with so goddamn much least-common-denominator pop.Take some chances and throw on some truly interesting songs on there. (More Gorillaz, eh? Or mebbe The Strokes?)Oh, and I won't call these CDs ""music"" until the D gets a spot on one of 'em. :)But really, come on, they've been making these CDs for a few years, and they still haven't figured out that there's more appeal for these CDs besides the kind of pop they've been throwing on them."
3,hard to get into,"still worth a listen,but its hard to get into,maybe needs more time than 2 months.a few decent tracks,but goes a bit off the wall at times,but im sticking with it and hope that the next one gets better,the jurys still out joe"
4,INDEED,"I think this CD is great. Infact, I think it's better than Rock art and the X-ray style. If you're reading this review, I don't need to tell you who Joe Strummer is... and I probably don't need to tell you that he's been exploring all sorts of music genres as of late. What you probably wanna know is, ""Are these songs any good?"" Well, in my opinion, yeah! First of all, the opening track, Johnny Appleseed is catchy as hell. It could easily be a hit on the radio. (Although no radio station will ever play it) And the electronica inspired Cool'n'Out is as rock'n'roll as any Clash tune. I also like Bhindi Bhagee, Gamma Ray, and Mondo Bongo. The CD kinda loses steam towards the end there....but it's still pretty good. It's worth the money. So buy it fool!"
3,"Here's to you, Joe Strummer","I've had this since it was released, and was convinced that itwas not nearly as good as Rock Art and the Xray style. Joe'sVERY UNFORTUNATE death promped me to re listen, and add a review.What I hear is an artist more determined, much like Peter Gabriel, to embrace the many diverse musical sounds that fill ourworld. At the same time, Joe has a story to tell about avariety of topics. In one of his last interviews, Joe indicatedthat he was tired of The Clash overshadowing his work giventhat he still had alot to say. This album is proof that Joewas as vital when this was released as his day's with the Clash.I only hope that the recordings for the 3rd Mescaleros recordfind their way out."
4,Caveat Emptor,"Just so you know, the editorial review of this product says that it's a keychain, but it's actually a magnet-backed frame... for your fridge, for your locker, but NOT for your keys."
3,Pretty good disc,"This disc is definitely a step up from her last album of all original material (Blue Roses From the Moons). This time the songs are good and solid...and consistent in quality throughout the CD. It doesn't quite achieve the high points of Flyer or Other Voices Other Rooms or some of her early work, but it is certainly a respectable addition to any Nanci Griffith collection. While the CD is pretty good, I wish Nanci would let more of the raw, energetic, but stripped-down folky sound of her earlier work come through. The slick production sounds good with her voice, but tends to mellow it out too much. But overall, I'd recommend it."
1,Typical poor quality film,"Poor second rate acting included with lots of action. The tough guys can't hit the broad side of the barn even with automatic weapons while the good guys kill them with pistols and shotguns.Included in one of the totally unrealistic scenes is a bulletproof blanket!!!Granted most films have untouchable heroes, but this one stretches it too far - don't waste you $$ on this film.I watched it and then tossed it into file 13."
4,Good and fast,"The book was little less than good. It was only the cover and the first 2 pages that were scratched and cut, but everything inside is great. Very minimal writing and the pages were in great condition. It was a former library book though."
5,very efficient,"The service provided was very efficient. The price I paid was good for me and the book I received was in excellent condition. Just a remark about the long delivery time from usa to italy. But I suppose this is due to custom procedures not to amazon.Audio Power Amplifier Design Handbook, Fifth Edition"
4,Just what I needed,"After Hurricane Sandy, I felt compelled to assemble some items in case a disaster ever happens in the Midwest. This butane stove seemed to be just what I needed in case of emergencies."
3,Portable Stove,Stove is fine. The packaging left much to be desired. Not adequately taped and flimsy. By the timr it arrived it was in a shambles. It was just fortunate the stove was still OK.
2,Not that great,"This did not live up to my expectations. When stripping, with wire strippers, I found there was almost no way not to strip off some of the strands along with the jacket. Overall this just seems like a cheap, low quality product."
1,Do not be fooled by gauge alone!,"If you're thinking this looks like a good buy for 14 gauge wire, be aware that this is copper-coated wire, not full braided copper! I would much rather direct you to Monoprice where you can get pure copper 12 guage wire for roughly the same price.Do not buy this wire!"
5,"Quality wiring, great price","14-gauge speaker wire at a great price. Don't get a fancy system that has to be scaled down due to 16-gauge...14-gauge is the way to go. Also RCA is a solid maker of audio cables and wires, so all in all I would have to recommend this product."
5,Well Wired,"The RCA AH16100SN 16-Gauge Speaker Wire (100 Feet) was perfect for connecting the rear speakers of our surround sound system. The 16-gauge wire was more than adequate for the wattage delivered to these rear speakers, yet was small and flexible enough to be easily concealed and unobtrusive. I especially appreciated the clearly visible white tracer strand, which made sure polarity was maintained. Amazon Prime value, rapid delivery and customer service make the site my first choice for shopping these days."
2,Do not like the way of packaging,I do not like the way the merchandise is packaged because it is very inconvenient to use. I will not recommend to other.
4,Cheap but works fine,"Wire was okay, seemed thinner than the same gauge store bought stuff I used for the other half of my install. I used the wire to reach out to my rear speakers, lost strands when plugging in. Not crazy about the stuff but it works fine. Great price, free prime shipping!"
3,"Decent, but it's not copper","I bought this for some short runs, so I'm not too unhappy with it. When I went to terminate the wire, I was surprised to see that the exterior of the wire is copper, but that's just a coating; the wire is aluminum. It will work, but aluminum is much less conductive than copper. I'm wasting a few watts when I use this cable.Other than that, the cable is easy to work with. It's flexible, not brittle, and the jacket is nice. I didn't measure the spool, but there's probably 100 feet there. Finally, the 14 gauge measurement is accurate, since that's the setting I use to strip it with my Klein strippers.In all, the product is usable and meets its specs, but I'm disappointed that the wire is not copper. I'll use what I've got, but won't be buying this product again."
5,Great value!,"No need for MONSTER ZOMG AWESOME (also read: overpriced) cables when this does the job. Easy to work with, nicely thick and strong."
5,PERFECT!!,This wire is long and thick enough to wire my speakers to my receiver anywhere in my room. I love the length on it and it was really cheap! I went to Best Buy to price match it and I saved around $25 dollars!
4,Good price wire but a little thin for me,"It is a little thin for using with my banana plugs. I got thicker wire. The price is cheap (RCA AH1650SN 50 Ft. 16-Gauge Speaker Wire $5.65). It is not worth to return it, and I will keep it for other use later."
3,Is this copper wire or copper clad aluminum wire?,"RCA AH16100SN 100 Ft. 16-Gauge Speaker WireUnder technical details it says this is 100 feet of ""CCA,"" also known as copper clad aluminum.So wouldn't this actually be considered an aluminum wire as it has strands of aluminum coated with a very thin layer of copper?It wouldn't have the same level of conductivity or performance for music sound as pure copper wire. I notice this wire is about 1/3 to 1/4 the price one could pay for speaker wire in stores, which I would assume is pure copper. Copper is much more expensive these days and aluminum is an inexpensive alternative. I am not an expert-- I just did some reading on my own in trying to figure out the best 16 gauge speaker wire and price to purchase. What are people's opinions? Keep in mind all the other reviews for this wire has been extremely positive."
4,good for the price,"This is not a bad product for the price. Trust me, speaker wires are not the only ones to give you the best performance . There are a whole lot of other aspects like, your receiver, the music / movie source ( CD, MP3 or BD), placement of speakers, your room, .....and much more. So for most of us this wire would give the best results considering all other variant limitations. Do not spend $$$ on big brands as you may have other constraints not known to you."
4,Speaker wire,Seems to be good speaker wire. I doubt that it is oxygen free pure copper if thats what you are looking for but it worked for a couple of cheap speakers in my bedroom.
5,Great price for a good product,This wire was half the price of the same product available in local store. Works as advertised. I would recommend it.
5,standard wire,works good. the longest run I have is about 30 feet. I probably didn't need 16 gauge wire for my frond speakers but didn't want to buy two sizes of wire.
5,Speaker wire,"It worked..not much to say about speaker wire. The roll of wire did unroll without the wire being real twisted, so that made me happy."
1,May not be what you expect,RCA AH14100SN 100 Ft. 14-Gauge Speaker Wire Watch out.. It may not suit your needs. It is not copper wire so if you are installing it anywhere that will require bends it may end up breaking on you. The description does not say that it is aluminium wire.. In my case it was not even Copper Clad wire. Also it was not even 100 ft long (more about 60 ft). Description of item is lacking or quality is going down on the product.
2,Some Fact about this Cable,"OK. Here is some fact about this Cable (based on my cable investigation which I purchased here)1. This Cable is Made in China.2. in my opinion. This is NOT a real copper Cable.This cable is Aluminium Cable Coated with Copper.How to Investigate :- Cut the Cable, look at it. Copper cable will show Copper Color. This Cable show White Aluminium Color- Open the Cable, Burn the cable. Copper will show copper.When you burn this, the Copper plating will gone and will show what is inside. and the materials will become weakTry yourself and see if it is true or not.Correct me if I am Wrong."
5,Works well,Bought this spool of RCA speaker wire to connect a pair of Dual indoor/outdoor speakers to a Pyle Mini Amp for my backyard covered patio. The speaker wires work very well...maybe a little thick (18 ga. would have been ideal)...but work well none the less. Can't beat the price for 100ft!
3,I didn't need the wire. It is good to have it around as the price of precious metals go up.,I didn't have to use it. This spring I'll use it for exterior speakers.. It is still a good investment as the price of metal goes up and will come in handy.
5,Will buy again,This is a very good quality speaker wire and for the price I got was a great value. The length was enough to connect my 5.1 system. My satelites ate up 37 feet each by drilling and routing through basement ceiling.
5,Good Speaker Wire,"This wire was perfect for wiring my apartment with 5 speakers (the sub-woofer uses a different kind of wire). At $16 it was priced right, but at the $29 I see it listed at now I would look elsewhere."
4,Cables,"I am satisfy with the price I paid, even though the cables are not easy to hide or cover it actually gave me better sound, I am not a sound expert but I could notice the different in sound between the orginal home theather cables and the RCA I bought"
5,What can I say Its good speaker wire at a really good price!!,Not much to say about this. It's speaker wire. It's 16 Gauge. It's marked nicely with a white marker on one strip! Ta Da!!!
1,CALVIN.... HERETIC NOT HERO!!!!,"Calvin was supposed to be more than a ""Religious"" man, he was supposed to show LOVE and GRACE to All...EVEN to those whom he did not agree with or did agree with him...NOT MURDER THEM!!!!!... sounds like hate, for he never repented of murdering publicly or privately as far as it is known!!!!!!! I guess his pride told him that he had no need to since he was THE ELECT! Calvin has done great damage to the Church, the body of Christ and will never be a saint for ""GRACE TO ALL was not in his vocabulary it seems or many other Calvinists vocabulary :0( To teach that one should not be responsible for their own actions is NO WHERE to be found in the Bible. God gives each person a choice....""choose"" today whom you will serve..... for we must all finish the race for the prize that lies ahead :0)"
3,Meandering and Mediocre,"I used to read Star Trek novels with some frequency, and took the opportunity of the 40th anniversary of Star Trek to pick up this new novel dealing with perhaps my favorite character, Doctor Leonard McCoy, from the original series. The story was interesting enough, and offered some new characterization of ""Bones,"" with the clever device of exploring his life as it unfolds in two different timelines. The ending is reasonably satisfying, and there are some clever and creative moments. But, I do share the view that the story unfolded at a very gradual pace. Overall, the book was a reasonable addition to the line of Trek novels, but the take took a long time to unfold."
3,Not my kind of book but still worthwhile...,"I had very high hopes for the Crucible trilogy, since David R. George III has written som excellent Trek novels in the past, in particular The 34th Rule which is one of my all-time favourites.After reading this book, I am somewhat disapponted. It is certainly very well written, but is simply not my kind of book. Rather than telling of any new adventures this is really a chronicle of McCoy's life after the encounter with the Guardian. Sure, there are some new aspects of his life which are revealed, but there is also much too much retelling of past events.When I read this book, it felt just like I was going through the motions and wanted it to end. Too often, you know excactly what is going to happen and you think ""Oh, just get on with it.""Then again, it is well written and in the end somewhat worthwhile to read. If you (like me) like more TV-epsiode-like novels with new adventures, skip this one. But if you like introspective character analyses, read it."
5,perfectly titled,"This perfectly titled album is truly ""absolutely the best"". I am by no means a K-Doe expert - New Orleans certainly has more qualified reviewers - but I am a true fan, and could not believe this disc had not been reviewed. This is the K-Doe disc for anyone interested in old school R&B classics. Guaranteed to please!"
3,Didn't do what I wanted,"I bought this SY-30 to use mainly as a color monitor for setting up security cameras, but it has no ""contrast"" or ""color"" or ""tint"" controls so the images are not able to be adjusted for viewing. The video input port requires a special adapter cable to use properly. When used as a TV, the channel scanning is slow and it takes a long time to find a TV channel you want. It has adequate reception for general TV viewing. It is built nicely for rugged use, but mine will be returned as just not good enough to use."
3,great value,Wasn't sure what to expect when ordering this. Is for a Halloween costume. Other than having no padding inside am very pleased with the purchase. Will make it work and will be perfect for the costume.
1,Not My Thing,"I bought this because I read ""The Bedlam Detective,"" by the same author. Different story type all together, however this did get good reviews. Although I finished it, this was not for me. Even seemed a different writing style. I will move on to the prequel of the above mentioned."
2,just not up to par,"As you read in this book..the circle,the alter.....this is what gives this type of using a bad name...Cleanings yes...protective bag for your pendulum yes...but candles,circles,and alters are not necessary...I dont like it..."
1,Stolen Material!?,"I have read this book as well as The Pendulum Kit by Sig Lonegren. I have to say material from Webster's book looks awfully familiar to that of Lonegren's. The difference is that Longren's book was published in 1990 according to the info inside the cover and Webster's book was in 2002. There are many examples and stories they share that run along the same lines. I urge others to compare books and let your thoughts be known. As for me, I regret buying Webster's book and will never purchase any of his material again."
1,A self-obsessed journey that travels nowhere,"This is a self-indulgant, obsessive novel that is more concernedwith the mind of the narrator, rather than truely expressingthe grief of a lost child. I couldn't get past the obsessivemind games the narrator plays, and I had little sympathy forhis plight. It isn't that I place blame on the loss of his child,it is that he is so in tune with his misery that he inflictson everyone around himself (and sees himself as so much of thevictim) that it was difficult to sympathize with his plight.And why doesn't his wife have a first name? There is literarygame playing that goes on here, more narrative tricks with moodand atmosphere then a real attempt to reach the reader and engagehim somewhere. The ending is pointless. I most unimpressed withthis novel."
5,Fantastic Resource,We used this guide almost exclusively during our recent 2 week trip. We took about 7 hikes from the book and we found them to be very accurately described by the author. We were able to find hikes that worked for the whole family. Great book if you plan to travel with kids.
5,One of my favorites,"Out of quite a few books about Aikido that I own this is the one I return to most often. What sets it apart from other books is the demonstration of fundamental aikido techniques both with and without bokken. It concentrates on a small, but representative number of techniques. These are explained very well. Quality counts more than quantity. I have used the book to devise training lessons."
4,officer down,there was a good amount of suspence and unknowen turns to keep your attention and wanting to not put it down
5,"Adrenaline-filled, edgy, sexy ride.","Picked up this debut book on the recommendation from a local author and loved it. Officer Down is an edgy and beguiling ride. Samantha Mack, our protaganist, is an attractive young female Chicago street cop who gets blamed for getting her partner killed on a ""routine"" duty call. What ensues is deceit, mayhem and conflicting he said--she said, conversations. As Phillwrite says ""not only does the ending sneak up on you,"" it knocks you down."" You really are satisfied and energized in the end. Very enjoyable unexpected debut."
2,allergic reaction,"I really wanted to like this scrub, especially with all the positive reviews (and not just on amazon), but unfortunately I had an allergic reaction to it (and weirdly only on the entire left side of my face). I'm not sure which ingredient caused it, but just wanted to write this review so people know to test it out first to make sure they don't have an allergic reaction to it too. I did give it to my mom to try it so I'll try to remember to update this with her thoughts on it."
5,Excellent Teaching Company Sculpture of the Louvre,Ordered thru Amazon and this is a great course to take and found it from a vendor thru Amazon at a great Price......
2,"To: Anil Punjabi from CA, USA",You should check out the Gladiator Soundtrack it has songs like the one when the mother is standing at the top of the stairs looking down at the people in her house. The composer is Hans Zimmer. Great songs.
3,Question,Does Lisa Gerrard have the theme song to Man on Fire on any of her cd's? The remix at the end of this cd just doesn't do it for me.
2,Where's the Main Theme?,"The primary reason I wanted to buy this CD was the main theme ""Man on Fire"" by Lisa Gerrard, and it's not even on the CD? That 'remix' doesn't cut it. I can't believe they left this beautiful, haunting track off. No sale here."
1,Not impressed,"For a Scholastic print, I am not impressed. The book tries to be clever, but accomplishes little more than confusion and disjointed story-telling. I was so disappointed in this piece that I had to comment because the praise is difficult for me to understand. The illustrations confuse the text and the text itself is, at times, lacking in fluidity. It may be exciting visually, but the combination of text and illustration does not work."
2,It was easily forgotten...,"I read this book about a year ago. The book was not that good to me. I found it juvenile, immature, easily forgotten. It was not exciting and barely kept my interest, and I actually found it corny. Especially the ending. There was no tension, no excitement and I skimmed through the ending because I was bored with it."
1,Rendering With Mental Ray (Mental Ray Handbooks Volume 1),"This is old. The new revised edition is available. This one doesn't contain information on V 3.0 (only up to 2.1)and it's the Same basic book. Shouldn't they have at least changed the color of the cover or something.Why Amazon is still passing this off as current?? anyway. The new one is the same price, and it comes with a CD... go find the Vol 1:Second Revised edition."
3,It's not working for me...,"I'm not sure how it works for the people who gave 5 stars, because I've been using it for a few months and I'm not seeing those immediate results I'm reading about. I'm not sure how rubbing alcohol will remove my harsh razor bumps, but I will keep trying and hopefully some improvement will turn out."
5,ONE OF THE MILESTONES,"Many books, articles, etc. have been read. But tricks for success in e-service has not been explained better. I would highly recommend this 5-star-book to anyone who would like to improve her/his skills/knowledge in e-commerce industry."
2,Gorham Tulip Flatware,"I thought that it was a 5 piece table setting for four, not a 5 piece serving set.It is to much money for what you get, I am sending it back.I wanted a dinner ware set for four, not a serving set. I guess i should of looked at it more closely brfore i ordered it."
3,loses time,loses a couple of minutes a week. Took it to a seiko dealership -- they want more than the watch cost to clean and adjust it.
1,Great While It Lasted,"I owned Hoovers for years and seemed to tire of them before they ever wore out. Got this Electrolux three years ago and was impressed with the quality and performance of the machine. However, it suddenly died. The repair estimate came to over $200. I spent the money on a new Hoover with a three year warranty. If there is a sweeper shop near you, check whith them before you buy any cleaner you are considering to see what their experience is with that model. My local shop carries several lines of cleaners, and will steer you to a model that meets your needs, at a price that is competetive with the big stores. I wish I would have taken my own advice before I bought this Electrolux."
1,not worth the money,The warranty is only two years on this product because that it how long it lasts. worked great the first year and gradually dissipated in strength. Two years and two months later (and after the expiration of the warranty) the vacuum stopped working. Now I have to deal with the hassle of contacting company for repairs i no longer have proof of purchase which will probably make matters worse.
4,Pretty Good,"The machine is pretty quiet, compact and easy to store. The suction is very good. I am getting used to the large floor head. The power nozzel for carpets is very powerful and not too heavy to carry up the stairs but a bit hard to push. There is not good carrying ability for attachments but other than that I am very happy. Lots of suction power, compact and the retractrable cord is nice and tight so it winds up easy to get it put away easy."
3,Brendas thoughts,I wanted a strong Vac that is why I choose the canister electrolux. Is very light weight and not very loud. It does seem to shut down while using it. The attachments are ok could be better. While moving around the canister gets stuck on the cord. I wish I had tryed it out in a store first even thou it has so so power it won't pick up the carpet pile very well. I had inhouse Vac for years then moved and new house wasn't plumbed for in house and was forced to buy Vac. I will be buying another Vac but upright this time less worries of pulling a canister behind me I still give it a 3 star but will have to give it a 0 for ease of using around house.
2,Not what it used to be.,"Have a Electrolux canister that is 40 years old. Wanted to get a second vacume bought the EL 7020B Oxy3 because Electrolux was the best money could buy, well no more! After 1 month controls on the handle don't work properly. Cord retractor won't work properly, keeps rolling up cord. The floor brush is too long, not enough vacume power. Hose is starting to show signs of wear. Over all just a crappy vacume. Sears is so much better."
5,"18+ months of solid, quiet service","Looking for a lighter weight alternative to an upright bagless model when we moved to a 3 story place, I bought the Oxy3. It has been fantastic - great on carpeting and hard floors, quiet and efficient, easy to maneuver. It's had to go in for service twice (both due to someone not detaching something correctly and shearing off one of the connector pins - slide the latch, that's what it's for!), but both times the repair was inexpensive and quick. The suction is great on this model.I'm also much happier with a vacuum that uses bags - getting all the stuff out of the canister of the bagless model was always a mess, and unless I washed the canister out there was always so much dust left in there (not to mention how static-y the thing was). The bags are simple to change and contain the mess."
1,new people only\\\\,what a waste.if your new great buy it. if not a total rehash of basics.i was quite dis appointed.
1,A Homeowner in CA,"This book is not for your average homebuyer!!! Buying a house is (generally) the largest financial investment a person makes and Irwins ""advice"" on ""Buying Site Unseen"" and ""Buy Fixer Uppers"" while on the surface may appear to save $$, in the long run probably won't. This book is for seasoned homeowners who can financially afford to cover a loss should a problem arise via some of the books suggested ""buying a house for less"" tips. For the rest, leave the book at home and let your Agent negotiate for you."
4,see blue,i am arash afrasiabi and i had red this book before i think it is really a good guide for specially industrial designers who want to start their job in this fild so and it can help you to manage your self and your project very well.
4,"Highly-strung, historic days in the forest","An interesting `insider's view' of the signing of the Armistice in the forest at Compiegne in 1918 and a character study of the now largely forgotten signatories. This was an occasion with far-reaching consequences, bringing WWI to an end while laying groundwork for a reprise through WWII - and Keneally's interpretation, albeit from a novelist's perspective, provides a new, personal depth to this historic event. Well written, well paced, with just enough back ground to whet the appetite for further delving into the subject. The book can also be read as a case study on negotiation skills - tactics and strategies - and a reminder to keep the eye on long term goals. Revenge can be sweet, but watch out for the terrible consequences."
4,Hands-On Therapy,"This is a great book for people who like to knit, crochet or do needlework to help relieve stress, soften grief, and to give love. For me, crocheting is something repetitive, rhythmic and very calming. By slowing down to crochet for 30-60 min a day & focusing all of my thoughts & feelings on the intended recipient of the project, I am able to escape from the anxiety and stress of everyday life. I thought I was the only person who felt that way until I read this book. I don't know many people who do needlework and it was wonderful to hear stories from other crafters. The only part I disagree with is the title ""Cheaper Than Therapy""--Crocheting is not always cheap! I sometimes spend $100 or more on a single project!"
3,Blake Shelton CD,"I got his Cd cause of Austin and I love the song very much. I also like ""That's what I call home"" and ""problems at home"". He has a wonderful voice. Hope he around for a while."
4,My wife loves it,It is everything I expected with the exception that the luminous face was disappointing.It is hard to read late at night .
1,not worth youre money,I got this as a gift i had it for one day and it broke. I gues it couldnt handel the music on it all i played on it was Dazed and cunfused from in thru the out dorr album (led Zepplin) it started it started to act up when the earphone port was making my speakers all staticky and then i treid putting a new set of ear phones in it but still static then i turned it off and it wouldnt turn back on i charged it for 6 hours still didnt turn on. Well i dont think i would recomend this product i only had it for a day and it broke. but i can still rely on my trusty creative muvo slim mp3 player....
1,junk,"This thing didn't last long at all. First month worked fine. Second month, the files started to randomly get shuffled into other files. Third month, the folder files were unable to be deleted off the player, and the screen gave foreign jargon instead of english, so I had to remember how to get to menu items by counting 'clicks' and 'ups and downs'. Fourth month, the screen went out. Bottom line, stick with a proven technology leader like Sandisk, who have been making quality flashdrives for years. I've got one of their players and have had not one problem for nearly a year."
1,Disappointed mom,"This item was given to my 5-year-old son as a Christmas gift. The knobs on the back are flimsy; one actually came out in my hand while I was setting the alarm for him. We've had it 2 days. The alarm seems to go off completely at random without reference to the time for which it is set. This is quite disconcerting to a small child in at 3 in the morning (plus no fun for Mom and Dad either). Once the alarm goes off, there seems to be no discernable way to shut it off, you just have to wait it out. We're tanking this alarm clock and buying my son a model similar to that my daughter received (Disney Buzz n More)."
2,Good but not Great,Hello Everybody in Prince World!!!! I am A huge Prince fanatic but with this release i just don't agree with the very best part. Prince should have at least a 6 box cd set he just don't get the credit he deserves. If u r interested in Prince maybe this is ok to start off with but i strongly suggest u pick up Prince the hits/b-sides.
3,"Good Collection, But","This is a great overview of Prince but,It doesn't have rare gems or b-sides. I would buy The Hits/B-sides. This is great money to spend."
2,An OK CD for those into mid-80s Prince,"I might recommend this CD to people who have recently (1990s and beyond) discovered Prince. However, I would suggest going to Amazon and buying Princes's 'The Hits'.This CD is an OK introduction to Prince's earlier works, especially the mid-1980s... 1/3 of the songs are from 1999 and Purple Rain. Unfortunately it includes nothing from Dirty Mind or Controversy and very little from the 90s and beyond. With the CDs heavy focus on the 80s how could it not include classic B-sides Erotic City or 17 days.Overall I would probably recommend this collection to the most casual fans, perhaps people who went to high school or college in the 80s and liked listening to the Purple One back in those days. This CD she be renamed ""The Very Best of 1980s Prince""..."
2,"It's great that it includes ""Money Don't Matter 2 Night""","But it's definitely worth passing by. For the best Prince ""Best Of"" experience, get Hits 1 and 2, and Hits + B-Sides. A lot of great stuff is left out here, making this ideal only for the casual fan."
1,Weak compilation...missing tracks,"This is one of the weakest compilations from such a big performer and great songwriter like Prince.He has above 20 albums.There are 4 songs from Purple Rain and 4 songs from Diamond's and Pearls. Okay, these two were the most popular albums of his. That's true. But. Why Let's go crazy, I would die 4 U, Gett Off and Money don't matter 2night on it? And also why U got the look and Thieves in the temple on it? I don't think these two are among his best. No way!Where is When you were mine?Where is Controversy?Where is Pop Life?Where is Gold?Where is The Most beautiful girl in the world?Where is Dinner with Delores?Where is Holy River from Emancipation?There are no songs from The Gold Experience, no songs from Emancipation and no songs from Chaos and Disorder. There are no songs from The Vault..., no songs from Batman, no songs from Rave Un2 and NO SONGS FROM HIS SYMBOL ALBUM, WHERE IS SEXY MF OR MY NAME IS PRINCE?Simply skip it and get the 3-disc set The Hits instead."
3,Not Enough For Even Casual Fans,"The only reason to release a one disc overview of Prince's long and brilliant career is to sell it to those with only a passing interest, and this complitation does a less than perfect job of doing so. The 'Very Best' of Prince was sloppily assembled, including less-important songs over more-important ones. 'Gett Off' and 'Money Don't Matter 2 Night' are great songs, but do not belong among Prince's most essential work. 'Erotic City', '7', 'Controversy', and 'The Most Beautiful Girl In The World' are essential tracks that are regretably missing. However, most of his best hit singles are here, and for those who won't miss the songs listed above, it could possibly be sufficient. Most people would be much better off with 'The Hits/The B-Sides', even though it costs much more."
2,Technical Problems,"I rate this unit a 9+ for design but the implementation is below par. I purchased the unit at Fry's (in Sunnyvale, CA) and here are my observations:1) None of the Volume, Bass, Tre controls work at all. 2) The audio sounds ""tiny"" - there is no bass to speak of. 3) The left-right channels are opposite that of my PC and stereo. 4) It is impossible to change batteries but you probably don't need to. 5) The USB device driver crashes my Win98 (eMachine) everytime I remove the Jukebox after downloading. 6) On the positive side, it's firmware is downloadable and I upgraded mine immediately (ver. 4.12a) 7) The product is perfect in concept but I would wait for the next version. This one is going back to the store."
4,Good Concept - Solid performance for money,"This might be a premature review since I have been using the unit for a week. The pros I like-- cheap-- compact size, small as a walkman-- can be used as an extra drive to carry/store your docs-- volume is ok. I don't know why people complain. Buy a new set of headphones since the ones it comes with is pretty useless.The cons are-- resume function after unit shutdown for shuffle feature is available only if u install firmware 5.0-- volume up and down should be +,- if hold for a long time, it is a pain finding the on button and hitting the +,- at the same time.-- case it comes with is useless. No acc. to the buttons is available. Should be a transparent case-- it does skip, not often but every once in a while so not recommended for jogging.-- Full battery charge takes at least 8 hours. A faster solution should be available.-- long term stability unknownI am on firmware 4.54a."
3,Great When It Works,"I've been using an Archos 6 GB Jukebox 6000 MP3 Player for more than a year. When it works it's wonderful. The sound quality is outstanding. Unfortunately, keeping it working is a problem. The first one I received was defective. It took two months before the customer service department would even respond to my requests. They eventually replaced the device. This one worked well... for a while. Once again I'm in a holding pattern with customer service. The person who reccomended this product to me has had no trouble in nearly two years of use, so it might just be bad luck on my part and bad customer service on theirs. One more thing... Don't waste your money on buying the add-ons. I ordered the car kit and it turned out to be the same stuff I could have picked up at Radio Shack for twice the price."
4,Very Impressive,"This is a great product. I use it all the time. Sound quality is poor with the stock headphones, but toss 'em and get a pair of quality headphones and you'll be amazed. Battery life is excellent. Firmware updates have been good.Beware. Technical support is non-existent. Phone calls and e-mails are not returned. If you are a not comfortable with technical appliances, you may have some trouble since help is hard to find. Too bad, because this little thing is really amazing."
2,Be forewarned,"My jukebox worked great for the past 2 months until yesterday. I was just holding it in my hand when I stopped it then started it again 2 minutes later and it wouldn't start up for no apparent reason. I'm not sure about other hard drive based players but take the fragile/defective issue into consideration. I am seeing a lot of similiar posts about this same problem. Otherwise, when the jukebox worked it was great."
2,"Although it seemed promising, it was not!","This juke box looked interesting. However, you cannot operate it without the provided musicmatch software. When you plug/inplug, it shuts off!!It is not easy to drag and drop files and especially music files without going through their whole process.The updates are not working easily, and the website faqs are not well explained.I have seen a newer version. Hopefully the above issues are resolved. But this particular one is not worth your money"
2,An ok player for the price,"The first thing I thought when I opened the box was ""wow, this is tiny.""The sound quality is good but the controls are awful. Changing the volume requires several button presses. Shuffle play is very flaky--I had one song play 3 times in a row. I've also had the player ""lock up"" and require a power reset to get it playing again.The product is also marketed as a USB Hard Disk--something for which I have no need. However, it does provide me with an inexpensive storage solution for all of my ripped CDs which can be moved between my computers with ease.Given short battery life, flakey playback, and difficult to use controls. I'm not sure where this product is most appropriate. It's cute though so I continue to play around with it, but I certainly could live without it."
5,Very nice little player,"This is an amazing little device that outshoots the competition on many fronts. It does have a couple disadvantages, but compared to the nomad (where you can't fast forward or rewind) I would give it 5 stars. The USB cable makes data transfer a cinch. The batteries last even longer than the estimated 8 hours. You can use ordinary AA batteries if you need to. You can organize the songs into nested directories for easy navigation. The headphones it comes with are crap, but a decent set of headphones are cheap. The charger works well and quickly. The thing is tough. I have dropped it while running and it still works great. When I called support one time, I didn't even get a stupid recording. A HUMAN picked up the phone and said ""Hello, Archos."" It looks cool, it has a back light, and it's small for what it does. It comes with a nice little case too. You can buy a remote control and car charger from archos."
3,No big shakes yet helpfull,"Sometimes a book only confirms the things you already knew, either consciencly or subconsciencly. This is not necessarely bad. I you run into a customer that violates every good practice that you're aware of, you can use the book to convince your customer that he's wrong and you're right. After all, all good ideas look a lot more impresive when they are printed.Apart from that, it's fun reading."
5,Kalaya Emu Oil Moisterizing Spray,"I have three dogs - two of which are high maintenance pets. I have a miniature Schnauzer, a Bichon Frise, and a Maltese. My Bichon has very sensitive skin and problems with allegeries and hot spots. This is the only product I have found that soothes the skin without irritating the sensitive areas. I brush both of my dogs thoroughly before bathing, then after squeezing the water out (not rubbing), I spray liberaly with the Emu Oil Spray and brush out using a very fine wire brush with a handheld dual dog dryer. The brush is usually used to fluff the hair. I think it is called a ""Slicker"" brush. The spray enables the brush to float through the hair and in the case of the Maltese, straightens it beautifully. The spray leaves the dogs smelling very nice also. I now purchase the product by the gallon - enough said!! Rosalyn - a very satisfied customer!!"
1,Killed by a fatal flaw,"I bought the game. I started playing into it. When i go on a journey to this tower monster battles happen more and more often.In the tower they happen so often by the time you have figured out what direction your facing after a battle your already in another battle. A battle about every 2 squares(easy battles too. but time consuming) is enough to drive anyone batty. Because of of the frequency of battles in some spots(way more then any other rpg game ive played.) this game become worthless. The only rpg game that i have that i haven't finished and do not intend to finish.Im sure the programmers intended to pad the hours playing with frequent battles but they just manage to turn the game into a worthless ""paper weight"""
1,It will make u apreciate good video games,ooooooooookay. This Video game is not only the worst RPG but the worst video game ever me and Jimmy Stillson agree and we dont agree on much. Okay I want you to buy this video game so u will apreciate good video games like Xenogears and Saga Frontier. God even Tonka Space staions better than this. I bought it at a store ya see I kinda wondered why it was so cheap. You get in a battle so often you never leave one spot. But do buy it you could never Imgane how bad it is untill you played it. If u like Woodywood Pecker racing you just might like this and you just might be a bad video game lover too. Peace
1,too much effort........,"I purchased this because my daughter was moving to St. Kitts, and they lose power alot...the flashlight works...but it take alot of effort to shake it for the power...the light is not so bright...I suggest the ""Dynamo"" by the same company......."
2,"Great songs, annoying narratives","I agree with the other 2-star review. I love Gene Autry's music, and I've owned several CDs (the best being the ""Essential Collection"" and the ""Ultimate Collection,"" the latter now deleted but still available online), and I had high hopes for this one. The sound quality is generally good, considering the dates and the radio transcriptions, but the introductory narratives to more than half of them definitely make this a one-timer for me. I could listen to the music repeatedly -- although I prefer smaller ""western"" bands instead of the big band sound of some pieces -- but I don't need to hear the story-telling more than once. Maybe it would be fun for people with more of a historical interest in Gene Autry and the ""singing cowboy/radio days"" genre."
2,Not what I was looking for from GENE,"The music on this CD includes narrative introductions by Autry on many of the songs. A closer look at the CD liner notes revealed that each of the 25 songs on this CD are recordings from motion pictures, Autry's Melody Ranch Radio Show, and The Gene Autry Show. Not something one would know until the CD was in-hand.[...]There IS a Gene Autry LP I would love to have. It was a major prop in an old Burt Reynolds movie, the title of which I can not recall. The actor played a character that played the songs on the LP over and over throughout the entire movie. Perhaps it is a prop LP, made especially for the film. However, I am sure someone will correct me; so please, tell me the name of the film in question, or better yet, the title of the LP. That music is the kind of music I want from the real Gene Autry."
3,Hard-to-Find Compilation,"All of the first seven or eight studio Camel albums are worth having, and this compilation attempts to cover a lot of that ground. For hardcore Camel completists like myself this CD is noteworthy primarily for the alternate versions of ""Remote Romance,"" ""You Are the One,"" Highways of the Sun,"" ""Rainbow's End,"" ""Another Night,"" ""Tell Me,"" and ""Lunar Sea"" (which is live and amply represented on the live Camel albums). Not the best place to start for beginners, and probably not to the tastes of most Camel prog-rock 70's diehards, but I love the single version of ""Remote Romance"" contained here, better I think than the version on I Can See Your House From Here. This album's worth it to me for just that one track alone."
1,It wasnt that great,The movie was good but the game doesnt make sense. the first level sort of follows the movie. sort of. the other levels dont go with it at all. I cant even get through the second level. i had to use the level select code. And you have to do all this insane [stuff] in the last level. ITZ STUPID! And the noisy criket barly does any damage to the bad guy and it doesnt push you back far enogh. in my eyes it [wasn't good]. i dont think it was worth the money... but thats just my opinion.
3,80's style slasher with a Korean twist..,"To sum it up, not too bad for what it is. The film has no pretensions; there are no veneers or splashes of high art to be found. Basically an amalgamation of 80's slashers, expect everything but the kitchen sink, gaping plot holes, and plenty of blood. The story itself is borderline ridiculous and entirely unbelievable while the characters are one dimensional and generally uninteresting. Having said this, the execution is well done, some of the scenes quite startling, and there is sufficient bloodshed to meet's one's deranged expectations. The acting, though hystrionic at times, is uniformly impressive. The film doesn't tread any new territory, but sometimes, while sitting with the lights dimmed low and curled up on the couch, it's reassuring to know what's coming around the corner."
2,Korean Slasher,Like other reviewers. You're probably tired of the Asian ghost story. You seen one you seen them all. This was a breath of fresh air. I could tell that did put alot of American slasher films thought. The bunny mask reminds me of the New Halloween with little Michael.Toward the end of the film finding out the killer we thought as kinda predictable because I wonder why I hadn't seen character roaming around anywhere.But the end was a good twist.If your tired of watching ghost girls popping out of everything even you popcorn this film is for you.
5,Miracles in two small bottles,After I started taking these supplements my world was right again. The night sweats stopped and the mood swings became much more managable. My family is willing to be around me again!
3,Does NOT keep my Hands warm,They make mildly good covers for my hand but aren't insulated at all. You get what you pay for.
1,Terrible,I tried using it as hair color. It did not work at all!!! All my greys remained as is. Was quite annoying.
5,"Intelligent Design Creationism and Its Critics: Philosophical, Theological, and Scientific Perspectives","As someone who reads these reviews, I will do what I look for and keep it short. I have read Pennock's book (I wonder if some of the other reviewers actually have). I have found it to be an enjoyable read and full of useful information. It gives a very thoughtful over view of the current Creationist argument. It explains the background of the proponents of intelligent design and their methods of arguing. It then systematically shows where the flaws in their reasons lie. Pennock doesn't berate the creationists but does show that their reasoning, although perhaps seemingly persuasive in the courtroom of public opinion, really is not supported scientifically."
1,Intelligent Design Creationism and Its Critics,"I was going to buy this book--I confess I've only skimmed it, but wanted to first find out what the Intelligent Design people quoted in the book thought about it. William Dembski, one of these, says in a letter at arn.org, that Pennock and MIT Press took outdated, popular (not technical) essays without his knowledge or permission (legally), then gave critics the opportunity to fire shots without a rebuttal from him. I was hoping for a book of this kind that didn't present a rigged debate, but gives each side the chance to present their case fairly. It doesn't appear this is that book. Too bad."
1,"Roxette Fans, Beware...","If you are a fan of Roxette and looking for Roxette's music, do not purchase this item. The singers on this dance-mix are NOT Roxette, they are just singing snippettes of Roxette's music. It is interesting and may be okay for background music at a party, but if you want the ""real thing,"" stear clear."
4,car bike rack,"5 Star car bike rack. Well Made, fits my Ford Freestar well. It took me 5 mins. to Install."
5,Great value,Excellent product for the price. Already used it a few times and it works great. Easy to assemble and install.
5,works,"I took one bike from Miami to Tallahassee and back. The bike didn't fall off, so I guess it works. There are a lot of extra straps that you don't see in the picture, I just used those to tie extra knots on the bike. I have no complaints."
4,Very pleased!,"I belong to a biking club and I wanted a great price on a 3 bike rack and couldn't find one in the local stores under $90. I was worried about ordering a bike rack online at the beginning of a week that I needed it to ride a trail out of town that Saturday but I received it on Thursday and it worked wonderfully. It was very quick and easy to put on, left no scratches on my car afterwards and my only concern is that the space between the rack hooks could be wider for more roominess."
3,Not suitable for all cars,"The construction is good and sturdy, but lacks some kind of a rubber padding that would prevent scratches if metal touches metal - I would not recommend if you have a new car which is not bruised. I also am returning the product as it doesnt fit my 2002 Honda Accord if I need to have it and be able to operate the trunk - it fits but locks the trunk."
3,**Buyer Beware**Get What You Pay For!!!!,"This product is definitely a reflection of its low price tag. It's hard to get a good bike rack for one bike at this price, so getting a rack at this price for 3 bikes is kind of a joke if you think you will be getting a great quality bike rack. I purchased this product with this in mind and as I suspected, the price was to good to be true to receive a great product. It gets the job done however. You will need to spend a good hour tinkering with the hookups to find a good snug fit that will keep the rack in place. If you don't mind doing some good labor, this product is fine for the price, but if you are looking for a great easy use bike rack, this is not it. Good Luck!!"
3,NOT AS GOOD AS LEGOS,My son loves this toy but I find that the pieces do not stay together as good as legos. On one other set the axle sections would come off so easy I used LEGOS to re-enforce them so they would not come off.
4,Desert Cat,"Hilarious mystery. The first of the ""Big Mike"" murder mysteries. I laughed out loud many times while reading it. The protaganists are a beautiful (of course) female ex-marine/present mystery bookstore owner and her ""Abyssinian cat from Abyssinia""."
3,I like it,"The album was easy to listen to and something different compared to the current fare of popular music. The duet with James Taylor was a pleasant surprise. Some of the songs need something more, just not sure what. Still I'm happy with my purchase."
3,ehhh.........,"well...................this cd was sort of dissapointingthe songs seemed so great and catchy on the disney channel but its NOT worth buying the cd just to listen to them....the background music is too...technilogical, is the word. it drowns out their voices which is prolly a good thing cuz half of those people aren't the greatest singers.the only song i was inpressed with was ""anyone but me"" by christy carlson romano bcuz shes the only one who can sing =Pwhereas.......""cosmic blush"" (?) really made the cd kinda suckOh, and the ""All about you"" song is horribly put together at the last minute, you can REALLY tell because.....well it just sounds horrible, you'll see. that lady needs serious singing lessons. =xso, i recommend just watching the movie and hearing the songs in the background and stuff, but it's just not one of those cds you'd like to play over and over and over. Sorry, disney channel =\"
2,want more.,Too many pictures not enough Brisick. I would have really liked to hear more of his voice. Read like an assemblage of things found at the bottom of his laundry basket. Channel your inner Knievel Jamie.yew.
5,Good Monitor,"I have had this monitor, the Samsung 214T nearly 4 years now, and it is continuing to work great. No complaints. Love it that I can rotate the display. I keep it rotated in a portrait mode all the time. Makes it so much easier to navigate and read web pages, and not having to scroll near as much as with a monitor in landscape mode."
4,La Ragazzi,"With sharp, incisive prose, Maraini examines the unsweetened, bitter realities of life in Italia. These loosely interconnected stories are culled from actual newspaper crime reports. She adroitly imbues the facts with spirit, as she delves into psychological motivation and characteristics of the many and varied victims and perpetrators. These portraits reveal the predatory nature inherent in humanity and the vulnerabilities and exploitation of the weak. A dog-eat-dog philosophy reigns supreme in this vision of our post-modern world."
2,"No NASB, bias for ""social justice""","The book has two weaknesses. One, it fails to include the New American Standard Translation. The NASB remains the standard for accurate translation of the original language into contemporary English. Leaving out the rock-solid NASB translation is unfortunate. Two, there seems to be a subtle bias toward the liberal evangelical view. This is especially evident in the ""Witness by Justice"" series under the Leadership Section. All Scripture IS inspired by God and Christians should always be anxious to memorize Scripture and support justice (Prov. 21:15), but, in my view, ""social justice"" Christianity is seriously flawed. This book approvingly quotes the radical slogan ""No justice, no peace."" I hope that this is not an indication of the direction of the Navigators as a whole. All in all, I recommend the original Topical Memory System rather than this."
1,mediocre at best,"I hate writing negative reviews, but Engendered Lives is mediocre at best. I really wanted to like it. But in the end it was just a waste of time."
1,Extremely disappointing,"As an experienced knitter, I was very disappointed in the amount and detail of information Ms. Modesitt actually provides on her combination knitting technique. Out of the entire book, I found 4 pages to be somewhat helpful."
1,Conessions of a Prima Donna,"Wow! Have you ever read a book that is just so unbelievably full of itself that you are continiously shaking your head in amazement?>This is THAT book. If you'd like to read how wonderful and clever Anne Modesitt is, buy this book. If you expect to learn anything about knitting-buy any other book BUT this one."
3,Serviceable,"In my opinion, this book emphasized history and historical cases too much. While I believe empirical data are important for evaluating economic theory, I thought this book went overboard. Also, I found it annoying that many relevant facts to example problems (e.g., marginal costs) were not conveniently displayed near the graph, but rather, hidden somewhere within the text describing the example. Similarly, it would sometimes present important conclusions in the form of block quotes from authoritative figures, which can be useful for some purposes, but is usually just annoying. All in all, I wouldn't say this book is horrible, but I think there are probably better alternatives available."
1,Questionable,"So, what exactly is ""lucky"" about being enslaved to be a circus-performer far from ones natural habitat?At one time the circus-director says ""All the elephant needed was love"". A person would need that. An elephant needs to be an elephant. Please Oprah, be a little more critical and a little less teary eyed."
2,How to reduce your vocabulary without really trying,"As if the English language needed any assistance in moving toward simplicity, this book had to be published. This book contains, short, tripe, irrelevant definitions to words considered by Witham and Snyder as being vaguely humorous. I am confident pre-pubescent boys will find the contents will provide hours of laughter. Forget the book; ignore the sample. Reading should expand the mind, not contract it."
3,It is OK but has its faults,"There are 5 stories here, three of them are also in the 'Maigret's pipe', a collection of 17 stories. Please read my review of it also titled 'It is OK but has its faults' if you wish to know about the content of this one. I believe there was only one copy available at the time of my purchase consequently you may not be able to verify my views of Maigret short stories very soon...."
2,Rubber is cheap and breaks down,"The contstruction and ease of use is very good with a pickup truck. Loved it for the first few years. However, the rubber material that the tube frame of the bike actually rests on does not hold up. I've had mine for a few years but really haven't used it that much and the rubber loops where the straps go through are all coming off. This will eventually lead to the inability to secure the bikes."
3,hot!,"It was just a little too spicy-hot for me. I sold both bottles to people at work who have tried it before and love it. I think they buy it by the case! Also, the service and quick shipping from this seller were A-1+. I recommend buying from them."
1,I returned it back,"I have a poodle which I purchased this dryer to groom her myself at home, I was not able to use the dryer since the loud noise would freak her out!.. i returned the unit in exchange for a 2hp b-air power dryer which turned out to be more powerful than the metro 4hp version.. how is that possible?"
3,ok for home use,"I am an apprentice groomer and thought I would get one of these to use at home on my dogs and and any of my friends' dog who would let me bathe and blow dry them for practice. The force of the air is great. The temperature of the air does start out cool and takes a while and then warms up to slightly warm. Now mind you, its great for blowing the heavy water off of the dog, but perhaps I'm a bit spoiled with the dryer at the grooming shop that has a little more warmth to go with the power. It was taking me twice as long to dry my long-coated shih tzu as it does at the shop so I finally resorted to using my personal blow dryer with the groomer's third arm. I have another shih tzu that I keep cut shorter and it actually worked well for him so it would probably be perfect for shorter-coated breeds or dogs with shorter cuts and home use but I wouldn't take it with me to the shop to use, it would slow me down."
5,metro aftd-3 air force commander 4.o-peak HP pet dryer.,"I have four dogs, after I use aftd-3 air force commander, I will not go back to hair dryer anymore. Because it save me 70% of my time."
4,Sturdy,"This rack comes assembled and ready to use right out of the box. Very sturdy and easy to secure bikes with included nylon straps. Have hauled aound two mountain bikes on weekends with no problems. Three bikes would be tight, but probably doable."
1,Not Very Good,"I'm no yo-yo pro, but I think I can safely say that this one is not very good. It feels cheap compared to other yo-yos I have used plus its spin time is terrible. I can't seem to get it to sleep for more than 5 or 6 second. The weighting feels a little off and the sidecaps look really cheap. My friend has a Speed Beetle and it is a much better yo-yo at a similar price. I'd go ahead and skip this one.Dragonfly Yo-yo"
4,Pretty good wireless headset,"This is a good quality phone. Our only complaint is the earphone/headset, which can be troublesome to put on in a hurry when you are trying to answer a call quickly. The earphone design has a little rubber ""finger"" that hooks around your ear, so it often takes two hands to put the earphone/headset on comfortably. We ended up buying a separate Plantronics headset which has a headband that wraps over the top of your head, and it is much easier to put on quickly. You may find cheaper wireless headset phones, but they will probably not perform well. The wireless reception on this phone is very good and worth the additional money we paid compared to cheaper phones."
4,"Very entertaining, but a little bizarre.","This book is typical Johnny Miller - candid, slightly irreverent, and very entertaining. Oddly enough, however, it seems they forgot to proofread the manuscript. There are so many factual errors - it is mind boggling. For example, we learn from Johnny that Tiger Woods initiated the ""Tiger Slam"" by winning the 2001 British Open and PGA Championship, when in fact Tiger did not win either one of those tournaments. We also learn that Tiger is already married - Johnny refers to his girlfriend as ""Ellin Woods, Tiger's new bride."" This is bizarre stuff, and it happens throughout the book. There are many inconsistencies and typos. Yet all in all it is a worthwhile and interesting read - I would recommend it highly for all fans of the modern game."
4,"Entertaining ""up"" and ""down""","As an earlier reviewer mentioned, there are a few typos (or mistakes), but do not let this stop you from buying this book. It is an excellent read. Miller discusses his current view on the game of golf. He is very candid in his discussion and pulls no punches -- he feels that Tiger is older than he really is and because of this, his dominance in the sport will quickly diminish.I felt the best part of the book was his detailed discussion on introducing your children to the game of golf. If you have kids and want to educate them on golf, read this book. He discusses the great influence that his father had on him while growing up and how this made him a better person and a better golfer. If more than anything, I came away feeling that Johnny Miller is an excellent parent/father to his children."
1,awful crap,please dont ever buy this lousy cd full of four lousy songs that you are well advised to avoid.get any scorpions cd instead.
3,"Fascinating, but weird results","Jasper certainly seems to know everything there is to know about the subject. And he gets points from me for marrying a woman who has a family place in Little Compton, RI, where I've spent summers since I was 6. So I was surprised when my first two efforts with his recipes that sounded so terrific came out less than authentic -- definitely requiring adjustment next time. The Portugese chowder came out meh. (Will spike it with more red pepper flakes next time.) And the Rhode Island chowder came out harsh (will adjust down the bacon.) One piece of advice he gives that turns out remarkably accurate -- the chowder tastes better the next day than when fresh. But this is hard advice to follow when cooking for a crowd. And that requires additional recipe adjustment."
5,A Must for your Cooking Library!,"I purchased this book after seeing Mr. White on a Julia Child show. His recipes are tried and true and have made tasty contributions to our kitchen table. At first, I just read through it and kept promising myself I would try a recipe soon. Well, a year passed and my husband and I were invited to a Christmas dinner at a friend's home. They made a large turkey and no one ate the dark meat. As we were leaving, our host asked if we wanted the dark meat and legs. I said no, but noticed he was about to throw this wonderful meat into the garbage. It was then that I asked to take it home. I couldn't see wasting all that food. Not having a clue as to what I was going to do with it, I searched through ""50 CHOWDERS"" and found his recipe for turkey chowder. It was wonderful. I have made it over and over and tried other recipes as well. All the recipes are great. Jasper White is a culinary king. Try this book, you won't be sorry."
4,"good laugh, easy read","This was a pretty good book to read on a lazy afternoon with nothing much else going on. I like reading Coville's work, some of which is serious and some which is downright fantastical. Overall, it was a good laugh."
1,DON'T BUY THIS..........,"Sometimes I waste money and I learn from that but this time I really bought a blunder. First I purchased Magix Mp3 maker 10 and after using it, the CD database would not work and recognize the titles of my CD's. Well, a few e-mails and months later, Magix sent me MP3 maker 12 and told me that this would solve all of my problems. Ya right, now I have a program that reads the CD's and retrieves the titles and info but Rips them down to Mp3's with no audio attached. NO SOUND... I've tried everything imaginable and I'm a computer pro and still this thing will not work. I'm still waiting for them to get back to me with an answer. I guess I'll go back to WMP or iTunes, they are free and work great. Now I have an MP3 Maker that doesn't make MP3's. I should have read the blogs first. My advice, stay far away from Magix products."
3,A Bit Confusing,While The Love God was ahead of its time it does raise a few questions. There's not much in this one that's really censorable. But I do wonder why did Don Knotts accept this role? In his autobiography Don says he welcomed the chance to work with writer/director Nat Hiken. But after the movie was released many theater chains would not book it. Don says this was due to the subject matter & that such a role could be risky to his image. After all these years I'm willing to say let's foget all that & enjoy The Love God for what it is-a classic Don Knotts comedy film!
4,Disturbing Understandings,"Before actually reading ""Touched"" I expected to have the usual reactions such as pity for the victims and laothing for the perpetrator. Instead I found myself noting how some of the victims, the boy's parents and molester's wife, were partially at fault also. At times I actually sympatized with the molester which is a very uncomfortable place to be. The book made me realize how no one is completely innocent or completely evil. Scott Campbell does an excellent job of showing all sides of the issue and that this is a mental illness, not a malicious act."
2,Where is the lube?,"Purchased this for my wife and I. It ended up being more of a soft porno than anything. Not worth it imo, we didnt learn anything new."
5,Awesome Magazine!,"Are you complaining like I was about how magazines are all full of fluff, beauty products, Paris Hilton and light news? Check out this mag run by young people in New York confronting global issues. It was informative, artistic creative and open. I fully recommend it, and have only seen it improve during my subscription!"
4,A Valuable Home-School Resource,"A bit difficult to read, since it is organized like a textbook, this book nonetheless presents a very compelling examination of the biblical view of government that should be a useful textbook in civics, especially for home-schooled and parochial school students. Someone reading and answering the questions in this book will be well on their way to understanding the proper role of religion in government and the reason for American constitutional government."
2,Waste of Money,"I took the advice of Amazon's recommendation and the other customer reviews and was sadly disappointed. I would not even put her in the category of Floetry or Jill Scott. There are only one or two songs that I would listen to again, but not worth purchasing the album. She sounds like she has a lot to say but sounds extremley angry as opposed to educating other women about her bad experiences. I gave it away to someone I thought would better appreciate her style."
3,Timing is everything,"Once this Artist finds the right time to blossom she will. I must admit I do love the What if's, other than that. I really did not find anything else on this album that excited me. Honestly the what if's is such a powerful song it carried the entire album. So if your feeling the neo-soul movement, then purchase this cd."
4,"another ""new and gifted"" singer","Jaguar has a very powerful voice, the girl can sing. I enjoy the cd, even with the profanity. Yes, there is profanity, that is why I can not give it a 5, but if you can get past that, it's good music."
5,Logitech V20 speakers---great,"The logitech V20 speakers for notebook computers do the job well. Great tone, volume, size convenience and design. We use them for small meetings in our conference room, and also while at my desk just for music."
3,Depends on what music you listen to.,Owned this product for about three years.Pros:- Portable- USB powered (goes to anything now and days)- Clear soundCons:- Bass is too powerful (the speakers will move on my desk when listening to a heavy bass song)- Depending on what kind of computer you have USB ports can make or break this product- No complete tonal range
4,Logitech V20 Notebook Speakers,"The speakers seem to work well. It is convenient to plug into the USB only. The speakers are too big for traveling. I really thought these were a little smaller, similar to the ones I have seen at the local computer store. I probably should have looked at the size a little closer before purchasing. All in all, it is a pretty good purchase for approximately $[...] after rebate."
5,another logitech success!!,"Seems that logitech has the knack for creating accessories that are truly a pleasure to use. These speakers are great as a plug and play alternative to most of the crappy speakers built into laptops. While they do not supply a great deal of bass, they are plenty loud enough and are clear and crisp in their output. If you are able to buy these with a logitech rebate, they are the real deal in portable sound."
1,"Should be advertised as ""Only works with Windows XP""","First try, a Mac Mini running 10.4.11. The V20 speakers worked for a few hours, then went silent, and nothing would coax them to work again. Next try, a Windows XP machine, they worked. Then Windows Vista, they didn't work at all. Then Windows 2000, they didn't work at all. That's the last Logitech product I'll ever buy, since Logitech knows about the problems but is still selling these speakers as compatible with everything.For good USB speakers for a Mac Mini, I now recommend the Tritton Sound Bites. Only $28.99, and they'll actually work with a Mac."
4,Great speakers for the money,"Small, easy to use. I had an initial problem getting them to work ... not the fault of the speakers, but my lack of knowledge. I contacted the company and they responded immediately with the solution. I've used them enough that I am very satisfied with the sound and the ease of operation."
4,Sound for Price,"The sound that these speakers put out is great for the cost. There is a little mud when you go full volume, but overall should work for what you need."
5,Well designed speakers,"I am very happy with these little speakers.I spent 6 months on the road last year and am about to do it again. I really miss having ambient music but could never find a decent pair of portable speakers. Powered speakers all seem too heavy, with wires and crap all over the place.I got these speakers yesterday and I am really impressed. How often do you find a product which is well designed and thought out? They are light, easy to set up, attractive and robust looking, and most of all, have a great sound for their size. There is some audible bass, which distorts at higher volume, but which sounds fine at normal levels. This is probably done by simply increasing the diameter of the speaker, something that other portable speaker designers have not thought of yet. And, they are really portable!"
5,Good price for Money,very impressive speaker and for [...]$ (47 with [...]$ rebate) makes them absolutely a steal deal. i reviewed all kind but they are too good for there price of even 20 to [...]$. salient features for the deal.1. total price [...]$(if my rebate comes back). carrying case would be worth [...]$ if bought from somewhere locally.2. Sound quality is very decent if not bose like.3. they are USB.i would have loved a remote along but i guess that would be too much to ask for [...]$ speakers.
5,Great Speakers!,"Perfect speakers to take along in your briefcase. Great sound and nice carrying case. USB eliminates the power supply ""brick"". Also, works with my Mac Powerbook!"
2,too fragile,"So, the sound: good to very good for the size. Not disappointed, in any event with that.USB convenient, especially since no power cord needed.OK, now, the real problem, and it's serious! These speakers are just not built well, certainly not for being portable. They have little kickstands, which is helpful. But one broke almost immediately, making it a pain to use. Very, very flimsy. Inexcusable, I'd say. The other thing is that the connection between speakers has been an issue for me, as the right speaker (which connects and disconnects from the left speaker only)goes out sometimes. Have to fiddle with the connection. Not major, but certainly another pain, and just not acceptable, again.One more gripe, too short of a cord. Way to short.Bottom line, they're not cheap, and though the sound is very good, I am searching yet again for new speakers, less than a year out. Thinking for sure wireless..."
1,Wished I had Known About the Vista Problem :(,"Yikes I wished I had known about the problem USB audio device has with Vista prior to picking these up (as detailed by another reviewer). I too am having problem with Vista except I actually got sound to work for a split second on a Sony laptop with Vista SP1 but then nada. The so called hotfix that I found online from microsoft won't install and says it's not for my system. I also tried getting these to work on my Vista SP1 Dell XPS and that's a no go. Perhaps this is the reason logitech and amazon had the $[...] MIR. Factoring the rebate, I now have an $[...] paper weight :("
2,speakers that can not stand still!!!!!,"I am disappointed with this product, i bought this so that i can get louder audio from my laptop.but what happened is that: when i try to volume up, speakers can not handle it and they start to move and can not stand still, and then i put something besides them to fix it, but then they had a weird voice"
4,Very good travel set,"These won't fit in my Computer bag, but they pack well in my regular clothing bag. They have their own top notch carrying case with a zipper.The USB power is a plus, no extra cords to carry around. Remember you're traveling. Traveling isn't perfect. just think ""fluff and fold. I use my laptopas my main Computer. When I travel they are the best option. They sound very good, much better than computer. Very nice with the DVD player. They probably could be overdrivenlike a lot of small speakers. The front grills are metal and seem to be sturdy. I use them on my Macbook Pro. One major COMPLAINT is: they won't workwith my little Taurus travel usb hub. The speakers must be plugged directly to the laptop or they won't work. I don't know fault that is.Remember: You can always return them and start over $ 80 at Best Buy"
3,good speakers for the price,"I bought these speaker for my mother, who has a Mac Mini. I tested them on my MacBook, and the sound was good. Acceptable for what you pay for these things. But not great. My biggest gripe was that I would get intermittent cracks and pops through the speakers when playing music, but it may be due to an underpowered USB bus on my laptop, (I have not tested them with any other machines, so it could just be my computer). These things are designed to be easy to set up and use, as well as to travel, but I found them a little too big for bringing them along on a trip. And, as for the sound, you're better off with a non-USB speaker system for the absolute best sound quality. For what they'll do for my mom, though, who does not listen to music and will use them only with skype and general web surfing, they're good enough."
1,Not worth the money.,I recently purchased these Logitech V20 Notebook speakers and was very disappointed. The sound they put out was ok but after using them for about a month they just quit working. I wouldn't waste any money on them!
2,messy,"largely a waste of time and money. better read the Agresti, Therneau and McCullagh et al books.90% of the model estimating function calls and plots don't work in R. very messy code difficult to fix in R. maybe it works in S.book is not written carefully, many examples start from the middle of the example and it is difficult to understand which dataset the author is using and what has been done up to that point.positive: it has good ideas on modern methods and references on the methods."
5,Spider-Man: The Sandman Is Coming vhs 1995 paper sleave version,"Spider-Man: The Sandman Is Coming vhs 1995 is one of the 13 epsodies best vidio relaesed contian extras like the maxium carnge game commerial , the live action vote comersial with spiderman. this is secound printing of this epsiode on vhsall in all a good epsiode not on level of todays anmated cartoon but still fun"
3,Lovely presentation but figure quality a disappointment,"This gift set is very nice, as it comes with a variety of very well designed costumes and assorted gear. I collect vintage G.I. Joes and it was a refreshing change to get a female action figure. Alas, her construction has nowhere near the durability of the vintage Joes. Her posable qualities are quite good, but the plastic is a bit too soft and the hinges seem a bit fragile. I was especially disappointed by her head attachment, which feels like it could break with very little force.She does LOOK good, but I would consider this a toy for a more mature child of 30 and above. :-)"
4,Great quality picture but noticable input lag,"Picture quality is beautiful. The stand is sleek, sturdy & adjustable. This monitor is awesome in every way except for the fact that there is some input lag. Basically what that means is there's a small delay between mouse movements and movements of the on screen cursor. Input lag is an issue that affects larger LCD monitors, notably S-PVA, S-MVA, and Overdrive-TN panels. Most people may not notice it... it's very minor... yet gamers might get annoyed by it. I'm not a gamer, but I definately can feel the lag, especially when compared to a CRT. I've kind of gotten used to it by now but I'd rather live without the lag."
2,Poor Quality,"I loved this product when I first got it. Of course, with a baby, you are going to have to clean it at some point. When the time came, I followed the care directions for washing the mat cover. Unfortunately, it was ripped to shreds and could not be repaired. I contacted the company about the flaw but never got a response."
5,We're finally sleeping!,"This co-sleeper has made it possible for us to sleep for the last few nights. I am breastfeeding, and it is very easy to position myself so that I can feed him while he is in the sleeper, then just roll away. My husband moves a lot while sleeping, and I've watched him roll over toward the sleeper and be stopped by it. The only negative is something true of all co-sleepers - it doesn't stop your blanket from landing on the baby, so if you are going to use it, dress warmly so you don't need a blanket."
4,Portable and good for newborns!,"I am not a full-time co-sleeper, but I did find this to be very useful when I did co-sleep. It is very portable (light weight and foldable). I mostly used it to nap with my little one or occasionally to sleep when he was first born. I would imagine they can grow out of pretty quickly as it would become too short. I definitely think you could use it for a good 3-4 months, but not sure you could use it much longer than that."
5,Loved it!,"I have to agree with the reviewers that said this sleeper can only be used for a short period because it's so small, but for the time it can be used, it is a fabulous and useful product. I used this for my 6 lb DD. We stretched it's usefulness for 10 weeks before we transitioned to her crib. We put it away and brought it out for our new 7 lb DS. We successfully stretched its usefulness for 12 weeks. It is perfect for what it is. A sleeper that allows new moms and dads co-sleep with their precious new born. By the time both my babies were 2 months old, I was comfortable transitioning them to their crib. I don't think it is designed to be a long term co-sleeper. I bought one for my sister but her 9lb baby was too big for it so if you have a huge baby, this is not the item for you."
4,Baby in 'Family Bed',"Think this would have been a great product but we ended up putting our little guy in a pack 'n play next to our bed...only other thought, I agree with other reviews in that this bed is a little short."
2,Wouldn't buy this for a baby older than 4 weeks,"This sleeper may work out well for a newborn - possibly until your baby is 3-4 weeks old. I bought this sleeper when my son was 6 weeks old and he was already almost too big for it (and he is of average size). Also, the sides are very hard so if your baby sleeps with his arms up by his head like mine does, he will likely hit his hands on the hard sides when he stirs at night and wake up crying. Also the mattress seems uncomfortable and the plastic coating on it makes quite a bit of noise when your baby moves. It is a good concept, so perhaps would have been useful in the first few weeks when our baby was smaller and did not really stir in his sleep."
3,Will not last ....,"The concept is great, but if your baby is born at over 8 lbs, he/she will outgrow it in about a month."
5,My child sleeps through the night thanks to this cosleeper!,"My little girl had hard time falling asleep and staying asleep. She slept in her cradle up until we bought this coleeper in December 09. Since then she has slept from 11 pm till 7 am which for a 2 month old child is great! Now she is 5 months old and we are thinking to switch to her crib as she's outgrowing the cosleeper.I read in one of the reviews that the light is set very low, that person probably does not know that it is adjustable!I give all five stars and thanks to whoever inverted it!"
4,Overall a good product,This product was a life saver. The baby is finally sleeping in this sleeper instead of my arms all night. The only down side is as they grow they learn how to wiggle down and out through the mesh sides. I don't recommend this once a baby is older than 2-months old because their ability to move more and get out of the sleeper.
4,Cozy crib sleeper,"This sleeper is great for babies that fall asleep in places other than their crib as you can move them to their cribs without waking them. Appears to give my baby a more secure, cozy space within her much larger crib/cot. Only downside is that it's a little 'short' as my baby is fairly tall for a three-month-old."
1,how to shrink your bed into a bassinet,"So me and my wife bought this sleeper thinking it would be perfect for keeping our son in bed with us. And it would if we had a california king size bed or if one of us ""dad"" slept somewhere else the co sleeper is big for something you would sleep next to. Not to mention our boy was born at 9 lbs and 21 inches long we put him in the cosleeper and well he was barely fitting so big babies don't work well either. We tried but never used it we have a queen size bed and it just didn't leave enough room for us to sleep too. I would just recommend using a bassinet we did the baby got used to it plus no matter what it says it's really not worth the safety risks of cosleeping"
2,lumpy and short,"My daughter is 2 months old and already too tall for this. Why couldn't this be longer? What a waste. Also, though it is installed correctly, it always seems like she is on a slant, with her feet end higher than her head. I adjust it and it appears flat, but it still seems tilted. I removed the mattress cushion and this improved. Still not wild about this thing for the price. I did not realize that I would only be able to use this a couple of months."
4,Can be modified easily for longer baby,"I read several reviews about this co sleeper being too short except for a newborn. I had already ordered when I read that. When it came in I found that you can fold the end piece down and tuck it under the detachable mattress. Presto, it will now last as long as we need it to. Took a picture but don't know how to attach it."
2,Only good for a month at most...,"I ordered The First Years Close and Secure Sleeper for an upcoming trip with my 2 month old baby. My baby is 22 inches long and 9 lbs. This sleeper would probably only last this one trip as her feet already touch the foot bumper. Also, the netting on the end by her feet is not secure at all. It is flimsy. It has a nice and padded mattress though, which seems very comfortable. It seems like it would be great for a newborn, but not something you could plan on using for a long time."
5,Destined to be a classic,"I had to listen to this one a few times for it to really sink its teeth into me. It's a very heavy album which is what GWAR seems to be getting back into with this release and ""WAR PARTY"" It's taken me a little bit to get used to this streamlined back to basics version of GWAR but I love it now and I'm glad they did it.This album has a definite classic GWAR feel to it once you get to know it. Every song is good but some of my favorites are"" Abyss of Woe', ""Apes of Wrath"", Immortal Corruptor"" which is an instant classic and one of their best songs ever! ""Bloody Mary"", and ""Happy Death Day"" which closes out the record leaving you wanting more. This is a real good album and it's follow up ""WAR PARTY"" is even better."
2,a reviewer from massachusetts,"pete lee is gone!for whatever reason pete lee has been replaced.although mike derks is as sharp as always,there is very little real guitar playing coming from his replacement zach blair.the cd is mostly all chords.also there are no other xtra musisians,or charactors on thecd,no real introductions to the songs,and even slymenstra is gone.this cd was recorded last spring and seems to appeal more to a grungier audiance,but the beginning of summer2001 is when metal started to make it's comeback.i hope the next cd has more and better guitar work,and more characters,even though some came close,none of the subsequent cd's were as good as scumdogs this is the worst effort yet.sorry!"
5,Very good album.,"Before this album was released, I kept on saying that Gwar's """"America Must Be Destroyed"" album was their heaviest. After I bought this i'm staring to believe it's Gwar's heaviest!!!! Here's a song rating:1. Hell Intro N/A2. Battle Lust 5/53. Abyss Of Woe 5/54. Anti-Anti-Christ 5/55. The Apes Of Wrath 6/56. Immortal Corrupter 5/57. Beauteous Rot 4/58. Licksore 5/59. Bloody Mary 5/510. Biledriver 5/511. The Wheel 4/512. The Song Of Words 5/513. Happy Death Day 5/5Though it has some flaws, it'sa very good album. Buy this if you can."
3,"Very pretty, but not practical.","I bought it and started to assemble it and that was a pain! no clear directions. I had to look at the picture to figure it out. I had to glue all the pieces to keep them together. In the end it looks nice, and it really neat inside, but it need custom things inside, it's way to small."
1,"Should be titled ""Folly and Foolishness""","The only thing that surprised me about a book titled ""The Wit and Wisdom of Cal Thomas"" was that it was 207 pages long. Initially I just assumed that it was either a typographical error (maybe 27 pages?) or that the font size must be very, very large. Instead, it appears that the disjointed ramblings of a seriously creepy man can indeed take up that much space. Thomas' opinions and polemical approach are much better suited to the read-once-then-discarded op-ed venue. Collecting them in book form only allows the reader to discern the utter lack of perspective that might otherwise remain hidden. I would heartily recommend this book to anyone needing to level a table with one short leg, or who desperately needs reading material but is unable to find any comic books. Other than that, the only thing commendable about this book is that it's recyclable."
1,Irrelevant!,"This is probably the most irrelevant book on its subject I've ever come across. Shallow, pedantic, lifeless, laughable crap. Do publishers check authors' real abilities nowadays?"
2,never arrived,"I ordered this as a gage gift for a friend that was jonesin for some pizza (in Iraq) . . . sent it over a month ago, and it has still not arrived. The failed deliver no longer matters, since they made it home safely and got to have real pizza, but I am still annoyed that I paid more than the candy for the shipping that FAILED."
3,Not a bad CD,"While this isn't necessarily my favorite CD, it is definitely worth owning. At first, my favorite of the two mixes was easily JT's. However, after a few listens, Lance's mix captured my interest most of the two. Some of the mixes on Lance's cd are straight up amazing. Definitely not the best of the San Francisco session releases, but it's one for house music lovers who are looking to diversify their collection."
5,"Finally, McLeod's Daughters is here!!","I am so happy to have McLeod's Daughters here in the U.S. I fell in love with the show when the WE channel aired it. Boy did they make a mistake in taking it off. I only hope that Amazon will be able to get the other seasons. This is the best show I have ever watched. It is truly addicting!! Wonderful story lines,and great characters. I like the fact that women are running the ranch and the closeness that the sisters have."
5,Best Aussie Series in Forever,I can't get enough of this television show. I saw part of season two in Australia while visiting my family five years ago. I did some research online and found out that season two should be available this coming May and hopefully subsequent seasons won't be too far behind.
1,Wrong Item,"If you are going to be sending the American version of Shutter, please have it listed under the AMERICAN Shutter's listing. I was hoping for the foreign one with American subtitles because it is actually much better than the pathetic one with the kid from Dawson's Creek in it, but unfortunately that is not what I received, but I didn't have access to the post office until recent so I was unable to return it to get what I was supposed to order. Oh well."
4,Nice collection of 1970's Motown Super Hits... A Must,"On this CD you will find Smokey Robinson and The Miracles' ""The Tears Of A Clown"", which is certainly a SOUL MUSIC JEWEL.Also, you will find ""You Can't Turn Me Off (In The Middle Of Turning Me On)"" a marvelous song by a noticeable female trio, HIGH INERGY... Supposed to become the successor 'Famous Female Soul Trio' for Diana Ross & The Supremes. It seems it was another 'One-Hit Wonder' group, but the song itself, is simply MARVELOUS...!!!!All the other songs are also superb... But the two previosuly mentioned, make this CD worth to be included in your CD collection."
5,Yes! Harvey Mackay is my Guru.,"Hey Amazon--spell Harvey's last name correctly--anyone else catch that error?First let me say that I always hate finishing one of the Shark's books--that means I will have to wait a year to read the next one. His online site is a good snack, but I love a seven course meal of his best insights and keys to success.Some of the chapters seemed a bit too familiar, as in ""Haven't I heard this from Harvey before?"" but I love how he can put into perspective almost everything that happens to you in your professional career.Harvey is not shy about telling you his mistakes and what he has learned from them. That's the key, learn something from your failures as well as your successes.A must read for any young professional (as is Dig Your Well...) But like all his books--take notes and/or dog ear pages or risk forgetting some of the many nuggets included.Bravo Harvey, another job well done."
2,Nothing spoke to me...,"Everyone seems to be selling hope or shortcuts to happiness these days. I didn't find this one any different. I'm sure it speaks to certain audience, but I couldn't get into it."
5,A Katie Primer,"I am a recent Katie devotee and asked at one of her seminars - where there are a gazillion cds and dvds for sale - which of those gave a basic explanation of ""The Work"" rather than just Katie in action doing The Work. If you've been to one of her events, you know she doesn't come on stage and explain how one does The Work, it's philosophy and methodology, how she arrived at it, etc. she just starts doing The Work with someone chosen from the sudience. Anyway, the person helping me with sales said there really wasn't one particular disc, but they were obviously uniformed. THIS IS IT! If you are looking to start somewhere with Katie and The Work, and I highly you do, this is a GREAT way to start, (plus going to her web site to watch the videos.) If you have an open mind, you'll never be the same. The Work saved my life; unfortunately, I found it too late to save my relationship. I wish I knew then what I know now. My life and my thinking will never be the same."
2,"Stick to the book ""Loving What Is""","Katie's book ""Loving What Is"" 5+ Stars.This CD, ah 2 Stars and only for the parts where people shared their experience in a group setting. The first (I think) 3 CDs is Katie ""Bla, bla, bla.. bla bla, bla, bla, bla) very little substance, really no insight. Stuff about how she was sick, this happen, lad-dee-da...."" wow get to it already!Finally people share..oops Katie stops them mid-stream, dang it. A CD collection with just people working through issues and being coached would be wonderful. The content of any value could have been on 1 CD, 2 Max.I can hear you say ""Is that true, are you sure"" ...LOL YES! THIS TIME I AM SURE!I sold my copy on Amazon, you may do the same really soon!"
5,Great concept but not new.,"I had heard about this technique from my parents--still have their pinhole glasses. However, the book puts all the pieces of the program together. I'm still using my cheaters, but I have not implemented the exercises in the book. There will be some time involved in getting back to seeing correctly, but I'm looking forward to practicing and obtaining results."
1,The Program for Better Vision (audio CD),"Unfortunately, I cannot review this product because I never received it. Instead of the audio CD I ordered, the book of the same title was sent. I purchased the book several months ago. My efforts to contact Amazon.com were futile and the only recourse open to me was to get a replacement. I was charged $59.00 dollars for this product which is a greater price than the book. I want a refund, but Amazon.com will only allow a replacement, which I do not want or need. I am furious that I cannot speak with a customer service person and that no customer service e-mail address is available."
4,Good enough,Bought this for perler beads. Probably could have used some parchment but I like that these are cut to size.
4,Just what I expected,"Just what I expected, I got. Good service, good deal. Lots of colors. My kids are enjoying the perler beads"
3,okay book,bought for a class. didnt use it much. i didnt find it very helpful either. wont keep for future needs.
1,Not for all Mac users,"Having used version 4.0 for three years with excellent and invaluable help for optimizing my Mac 7200/120, I purchased v. 5.0 when I upgraded my computer to a current iMac DV+. Unfortunately, many features of the Norton Utilities 5.0 and 6.0 are not yet functional for iMacs, OS 9+ and G3, G4: boot from CD, therefore Optimizing using SpeedDisk is not available. Symantec's technical support site offers an abundance of information about their knowing of these deficiencies and they say they are working on solutions. Symantec says the same problems exist with version 6.0. Had I visited the Symantec site before purchasing, I would have waited for a fully functioning product. (3/8/01)Since this initial experience, I have not attempted to use this software again. I am unaware of any patch or upgrade offered by Symantec to remedy this problem. The Apple Disk Doctor provided utilities have been sufficient. (9/8/01)"
4,Great for first-time homebuyers,"I bought this book when I purchased my first house. I never realized how much there was to know about maintaining a house, but this handbook has all the information you need to help you get settled. I highly recommend this book for anyone who owns a house."
5,Fan from years ago,"Like a previous reviewer, I saw Kristen open for the Indigo Girls. Was an absolutely amazing show and I had to steal a friend's copy of this cassette after I destroyed my own through constant play. Each song is connected to so many memories for me and I think I remember almost all of the words...I can't just grabbed one of the last copies and can't wait to share it with my daughter! Feeling VERY lucky to get it."
5,Run to Paradise,I'm another people to people person who fell in love with this song over the summer. It's addictive! PS: I'm not 12 years old
5,april,"""and they even used bon-ami"" definately one of my favorite don knotts movies. i can watch it over and over, lots of fun. shipped quickly and was packaged well, and was priced well. would buy from seller again."
4,"Tell it, Luther !","Imagine a Don Knotts movie that endures and claims so many hardcore fans ! This is definitely IT ! The plot moves along fast and with charm, wit and humor. The Luther Heggs character is very typical Knots, but the supporting cast adds so much - the tapioca scene with the banker and his wife is hilarious, as are so many with the imperious Reta Shaw. We sympathize with her waifish, soft-spoken husband and love it when he sees THAT sweater. It is what it is and doesn't pretend to be more than that...a fun movie that can entertain a family year after year."
3,Good 'ol Don Knotts,"This video was one of my favorties as a child. Viewing it as an adult for my grandchildren, it was still cute but a little slow at times to keep their interest."
5,A Fun Classic!,"I recently missed this movie when it was on TCM and realized how much I used to like it and wanted to see it again. So I checked Amazon.com and was thrilled to see that they still sold it... and at a pretty great price. It arrived just in time for Mother's Day, so my 16-year-old daughter and I watched it together. It was just as much fun as I remembered and even my daughter liked it! Don Knotts portrays a nerve-addled underdog better than anyone in the business. I'm so glad I own this one."
4,TGAMC,Hey everyone what's up? Umm if any of you know what the name of the song is on this movie when it is played on the organ. You know the main title? please reply! michael
1,captivating,"Quite accidentally I stumbled across ""Bluelip."" Attracted by the cover and curious to learn about a dark episode of American History, I bought a copy. Was I in for a surprise! I could not put the book down before I finished reading all about Christia and her life: from the UT Campus in Austin to the starry nights of West Texas, the uplifting ""New City"" and the apocalyptic finale. It is a captivating read, and as it is already produced as a film script, I can hardly wait to see ""Bluelip"" on the big screen."
1,My dogs don't like it,This is a hard plastic ball. My German Shepherds (I have 3) MIGHT push it around once a week. The voices in this unit are garbled and it hurts your toes when you kick it in the dark. Over all this is a lousy dog toy.
3,Dogs love them,"My dogs really like these, they drive them crazy. Having to replace batteries is a pain and the batteries are not cheap. I have three of these and I was able to replace the batteries in 2 of them but the other one just won't work anymore. Still a good concept for a dog toy but like all dog toys...they just don't make them durable enough."
3,My dog ignored it.,My yellow lab was not at all interested in the toy. I think I'll give it to my grand son's dog he might have more fun with it.
2,Dogs are not very interested.,"Toy does all the things it says it does. Sounds cute, but the dogs are just not very interested in it."
1,I'm Actually Surprised to Find This Book is From A Reputable Author,"I'm actually shocked to discover this is a reputable author with many other works to his name. I downloaded ""Seventeen Days"" to my e-reader and it reads like a first draft. It's riddled with misspellings, grammatical errors, typos, incomplete sentences, etc etc. There are also blank pages in between every section of the book...inflating it to over one hundred eighty pages when it's really only about one hundred and twenty.I have been shaking my head wondering where was the editor? Doesn't this guy read over his own work? I thought this was a first time author opting to e-publish his book hoping to garner himself a name with the renewed interest in the Katie Beers case, as she is coming out with her own book soon. Although the content itself is engrossing, the writing is so sloppy I can't give it more than one star."
4,Worthwhile for the committed Beatles reader,"Rather than rehash the famous story one more time, or seek to glorify his own contribution, former Beatles accountant Ellis provides a brief but enjoyable trot through what he saw and did inside the history-making Beatles machine.It's written in a clipped and somewhat fractured style, almost as if the author had to be persuaded to record his recollections for posterity's sake rather than his own, but it's all the more refreshing for that.Look elsewhere for gossip, opinion or a Beatles bio, but pick it up if you're looking to round out your Beatles library.And I do hope the other reviewer will soon be able to finish the book, and then his review."
2,Holds only 3 lids!,The other spaces are not usable especially the top one. Somewhat defeats its purpose. On top it came without fastening hardware so I had to improvise which has delayed my putting it up. Would not recommend it!
2,Rather Boring,"I bought this game because I like strategy/adventure games played in the first person. I was dissapointed however because the nature of it is rather violent, requiring use of guns/knives or other weapons to advance through the game. In addition, if your character gets killed (happens rather easily until you learn the rules) you need to start over from the beginning. I want very impressed."
4,Like 9 novellas by 9 different authors.,"Thoroughly facscinating, the various storylines and characters that all interconnect in some way. The ending though was a bit fuzzy."
4,better than cloud atlas,"cloud atlas--dazzling. but like lots of dazzling things, it's something you have to look away from once in awhile. i couldn't put Ghostwritten down. the lapidary style is there, the imaginative leaps. the clues that connect all the characters in a matrix of sorts. the voices (this guy is a literary ventriloquist, for certain) haunt you. exotic far east stuff--stuff for history buffs. sex and drugs and stuff. david mitchell is the new william boyd/martin amis--he's that bloody good. 4 stars cause 5 are reserved for classics, kids. if you are a writer yourself, you'll be inspired by this, i think. i may seek out number9dream now!"
3,"Unfortunately, not as promoted.","This is the second of Mitchell's books I have read. The first was Number 9 Dream. As in that book, he writes well, cleverly and lyrically, if a little too cleverly -- parts of the book read like writing exercises from a good MFA student, with the result the overall point of the book is neglected. While he is investing so much time in his brilliant turns of phrase, the book is really going nowhere, regrettably, since it had a lot of promise. The convention of the linked stories is hard to justify, and although he does a better job than some authors with it, it never amounts to anything in the end, never arrives at the ""shared destiny of astonishing impact"" that the book's back cover promises. There is no shared destiny, just an amusing book that doesn't really deliver. I read it specifically to see how he managed to make the structure work, so I was especially disappointed that it did not."
2,YOGI,"In order not to be as disappointed in this novel as was I, you should know from the start that it is actually a series of nine tangentially connected vignettes. The first-person narration of numerous characters was effectively done and enjoyable, but that does not, of itself, make for a good novel.As the novel progressed, the dramatis personae swelled in number, each chapter unique in population from each other chapter but for an occasional reference. I was looking forward to enjoying all the actors being brought together to form a final, complete repertory company, and a final curtain.It never happened. I had taken the authors references to phenomena in other chapters as indication that the novel would end with all the characters' individual angsts resolved in a unified catharsis uniting all the plot lines.Wrong. These are basically unrelated stories."
1,cheap junk!,"These were going to be a mid level raffle prize for a corporate event, so I wanted a middle of the road poker chip set to appeal to just regular people - I wasn't shopping for poker pros or anything like that. When this arrived the outside of the box looked nice, but when we opened the box up, the fake felt panels had come detached from the inside of the box, and the cardboard backing in all of its messy glued glory is the first thing we could see. When I took out a package of the chips they were light plastic, and really low quality. I knew I wasn't going to be getting casino quality clay chips, but I think the kids poker chips at target for $10 were probably the same (if not better) quality as these. I sent them back and got something else instead. The only good thing I can say is the return was really easy, and I had my money back the same day that UPS picked up the box."
2,Disappointed.,"I wanted to surprise my husband with this set for Christmas. He had always wanted a set that had a feel like the casinos. However, he was very disappointed with the chips. We sent it back. The case also received a dent during shipping."
5,THIS GAME ROCKS!,For those of you with medium speed computers....THIS GAME ROCKS! THERE IS ALOT OF INOVATION and gladiatorial fun in this gamethats been overlooked by the more popular successors. They should have kept making add ons for it!
5,Surprisingly Good,"I've always been a huge Dylan fan, in fact I have most of his albums, but this one I had always kind of held off on, thinking, ""Hmm, Dylan doing a pure country album, this might be one to hold off on for a little while."" I was absolutely shocked. While the lyrics might not be as profound as Bob's greatest and the music not as groundbreaking, the album is positively infectious. I heard that this was a happy album and always kinda cringed thinking on other disasters that artists had created in ""happy"" moments. This is far from a disaster, in fact, it is an absolute triumph. Nashville Skyline is as good as country gets and then some. The slower songs, like the haunting remake of ""Girl From the North County"" with Johnny Cash are touching and the more upbeat and playful songs like ""Country Pie"" and ""Peggy Day"" are fun like they should be. The musicianship is superb and Dylan's vocals are smoother than usual. Maybe not top 5 Dylan, but an excellent album, even a classic in my opinion."
3,kinda boring,I'm sure the recipes would have been okay but I need a cookbook with pictures and this had none at all
4,Excellent gift to give,I bought this book as a Christmas gift for my son-in-law. The book arrived quickly and in excellent condition.I think that it will help him on those evenings when he has to fend for himself. The recipes seemed to be well thought out and had very good instructions.
4,Fast and reliable,Ordered this to replace old switch. Install self explanatory and quick. Have had for about 4 months. So far works great!
1,Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Tripe,"Not even a good cheap rehash of Robert Louis Stevenson - just cheap.The story premise was good enough, even cutting edge for its day, which was think-tank LSD experiments. What OL manages out of it, however, is uninteresting, unmemorable, melodramatic (a common second season failing), and anticlimactic.Ask yourself, if you're a fan of the series: how much do you remember, from this episode?"
4,Mistress of Mellyn,"I am pleased by the quality of the merchandise. I like knowing whether it has a dust cover, if the pages have wear, any staining or damage on the cover or pages. I do not buy if it does not give some kind of indication of these things. The seller was honest about all these things and I am impressed by that."
2,Disappointed,It was not made clear to me that when purchased you only received the study guide and not the textbook. It has forced me to go to another site for the actual text because of the lack of information I have been given.
3,grad school,This book was for my grad school class at STU and it was very necessary fir the course. I did not regret buying this book at all.
2,"Ok, but not that Grate.","i read this book last night in the bathtub. i must say that it the book wasn't the worst book that iv'e read but it wasn't the best neither. I would say that this book is pretty good. if you don't really know anything and need some help on computer auctions. I didn't know much about auctions, now I know a little, thanks to mike's booklet. Thanks mikes!"
1,Who's telling the truth?,"It's getting painfully obvious who has written the good (5 star) reviews and who has written the REAL (2 or less star) reviews. It's obvious from the author's description, as well as to anyone who has read this booklet, that the author can neither spell nor use english grammar correctly. Funny that none of those giving his book a rave review can neither spell/use grammar correctly, and in some cases they failed to spell their OWN city's name correctly. At least make it believable Mike."
1,What's going on here?,"After reading this tiny booklet I was very disappointed. I can't imagine how anyone would rate it with three, much less five, stars. Isn't there some way to guard against false reviews (i.e. those done by the author himself or by family members)? I think the reviews that give this book one star cover the maladies, so look at those so I don't have to repeat what others have already written. There's always that chance that I'm wrong and perhaps all these people really like the book...Hmmm."
5,Great book if you are serious about being successful on eBay,"I enjoyed the book and learned a lot. The author, Mike Baker, gives good, practical information. Unlike most authors of eBay books, Mr. Baker actually makes his living selling on eBay. While he is not a professional writer, it is worth hearing what he has to say."
5,Still missing this wonderful town and great people,This was a lovely TV show and I still miss it. The cast was terrific and acting so real and believable. Why are the truly great shows taken off the air? The networks keep the stupid reality shows and raunchy sitcoms going. It really makes you wonder. Sad - our society.
4,an easy to read book,"I found the book very useful. Before I went for the tour to Europe I bought the book, read it thoroughly and found the book very personal and interesting. My trip to Europe was made easy due to this book. Dr. Saha is a very talented scientific writer but this other side of Dr. Saha as a tour guide can only be appreciated if one reads this book and how he compiled his own experiences throughout the book. I recommemd the book for easy and fast reading."
5,A Highlight,"He did it again! Mr. Goldberg again topped his earlier Diagnosis Murder books, though I didn't believe this could be possible. The Waking Nightmare fascinated me to the utmost from the first to the last page.In this book we get to know Dr. Mark Sloan in a way we never saw him before. And I like what I get to see. Mark is a human being!The story will not allow you to put the book aside. It keeps your attention, even when you are asleep, though you should be prepared not to sleep until you finished the book. Expect the unexpected! You will not be disappointed!"
3,Stop Pretending to be Normal!,"The title of this book really sums up the most tragic aspect of Asperger's: the self-denying, closeted mentality. Nowadays, autistics are gaining more self-respect. Willey and Attwood's views are a marked improvement over previous depiction of autism as pathology, but ultimately, they reinforce a sense that, while deserving of sympathy, autism is a tragic deficit. Many autistics now feel that we are a positive neuro-variation, possibly an evolutionary step forward from the mob mentalities that now crush this planet."
2,Just One Woman's Tale,"As an autobiography this is an easy and creative read. I was raised by a mother with AS. Her difficulties make Lianne's look plain querky or individualist. This is just one woman's tale. Asperger's Syndrome can be far more difficult to live with than this and certainly most AS sufferers would have trouble talking of themselves (and especially others) with such sustained and reasoned insight, though eloquence with words is common. AS runs in my family on both sides. I couldn't help but feel Lianne is just socially uncomfortable, as so many people can be and just has her own pet querks like the majority of us! Perhaps she is at the higher fundtioning position on the imfamous 'spectrum' of this disorder. Otherwise,...Asperger's Syndrome? Doesn't sound much like it to me."
3,Pretending to be Normal Living with Aspergers syndrome,Was moved by the writers story. Enjoyed her writing style and thought it was pretty good reading.
4,A Stunning Visual History..!,"Great story and history of this true American business , and of course FANTASTIC GRAPHICS ! !"
4,A Must-Read for Jerks Everywhere,"I stumbled across this excellent book while printing copies at Kinko's one day. It was more than just a coincidence with all of the problems I was having at work with micromanagers and their little cohorts.I thought this book was an excellent guide to the types of jerks at work and ways to deal with them. The one problem I see with this work is that it won't be read by the people who really need to read it: the jerks themselves.If you like this, read ""The Digital Umbrella"" to see just how nasty these Jerks at Work can get."
5,"""hey I can do that!""","While Mel Stabin's style is much looser and more direct than mine, I still value his approach to watercolor painting. His examples in this book will make you say, ""Hey, I can do that!"" And that is precisely why I would recommend it to beginners as well as advanced watercolorists. He has a knack for reducing picture elements into simple shapes and bold washes that really work. Check it out."
5,One of the very best,"If you love loose and juicy watercolor painting, you'll love this book.It is filled with goodies, wonderful paintings and demos on how they were done. I have many books on the subject and this one ranks as one of my favorites. Landscapes and portraits all done with great flairand a very high level of drawing skill. There is some similarity in style and approach to my other favorite watercolor artist, Charles Reid.Mel Stabin is the real deal,very inspiring work of the highest order. Buy this book, you'll love it."
2,Poorly written and edited book,"Although I know Magda suffered terribly, she repeated herself over and over again and that made the book drag on. I sympathize with all she endured, however, the style of writing detracts from her story."
4,good book for comic book fans,This book is a great read for comic book fans because it explains the importance of inking comics.The book gives examples of the importance of inking by showing examples of particular comic book pages inked by various inkers.This shows how the end result depends heavily on the particular inker.
3,Fast but scary,I was impressed with the speed these blades could cut wood. I was also as impressed and dismayed that they walked all over as you sped up to the cut speed.If you go slow and use a guide on one edge they cut realy fine and straight. If not look into scroll designs that you didnot want.
1,Not for beginners,"I am disappointed in this book. If you have never made bread, there are no descriptions to tell you what your dough should look and feel like. If you've been making bread for a while, you'll wonder why the author doesn't provide weights for ingredients. While this book is aimed for the home kitchen, Mr. Laskin recommends that you use at least an 800 watt mixer for his recipes. If you don't have one, don't buy the book. I used my Kitchen Aid Pro (575 watts) and burned the motor out following recipe directions."
2,Not As Good As Her Others,"I was really disappointed with this one because I am a fan of Ms. Jackson's work. Usually, she has a distinguished, unique voice that I admire and enjoy reading. ""Blessings"", however, seems to be written by someone else. I couldn't believe it--it was so cliche-ridden. It seemed to lack skill. It is another book in the pile of typical black fiction (and I won't say African-American because I AM Canadian). But I will continue to read Ms. Jackson's work nevertheless."
4,I loved it!!!,"Kudos Sheneska!!! This book is a very good read. I read it in two days. Even though these women had many problems it seems as if I could relate to each woman in a different way. All I can say is Zuma, Zuma, Zuma... if we could all have her self-control we could all be millionaires!!!While I agree with the others who said the adoption was a little bit unbelieveable it is the actions that occur after it that made the book worth reading. Even though I feel the ending was a bit rushed (all problems were pretty much solved in the last 2 chapters...Yeah right!!), I still found the book to be very enjoyable. I couldn't put it down!!!"
3,Entertaining.,"I found ""Blessings"" to be an entertaining and easily digestable novel. The author was able to maintain my attention throughout the book. The characters were believable,interesting and unpredictable. I was particularly entertained by her use of language and inner dialogue. My main criticisms are that Ms. Jackson used more profanity than seemed necessary thoughout the novel, which tends to be the case with the crop of current Black authors -- the forerunner being Terry McMillan. The end of the novel also seemed a bit rushed. I was particularly disappointed in her handling of the adoption situation, which I found a bit unbelievable, though not predictable. .."
3,"Good, but...","Sometimes, an unrealistic ending can dim the entire enjoyment of a book.That is how I felt about this book.The storylines were engaging and held my interest. However, the ending about Sandy was so unrealistic that it turned me off. There is no way in heaven or hell that Sandy would not have been prosecuted -- at the very least, her story would have a very different ending than what we were given in the book.(I'm trying hard not to give it away, but I really want to go on a rant!!!!).I wish the ending had been more realistic. Had it been, I would have given this book 5 stars..."
4,Overall pretty good book,"I wasn't entirely disappointed. Whenever you can relate to the characters or become emotional about what's going on then you are reading a good book. It was a bit slow for me,but the ending moved pretty quick. Of course some parts were a surprise but others you sort of figure out early on."
5,Lots Of Fun,Little tiny photo album perfect for keeping the iZone shots together instead of littering the house. Lots of fun...the teenagers loved them.
4,Hardly essential in this form,"Rhino's ""Very Best of..."" has 16 tracks to this collection's 12 for the same price. Too much is left out to consider this CD a true package of ""essentials"". Stick with the Rhino CD, or spring for the 2-CD ""Anthology"" (also from Rhino) for a better-rounded Rascals collection."
5,New Found Love,"This book teaches the reader how to create lasting relationships with each other, by ""unlearning"" the wrong views of Love we have learned over the years through rejection, abandonment, abuse and conditional love, and focusing on God's unconditional love. You will learn, after completing the exercises throughout the book, what has influenced your personal view of love. This book is full of practical ways of improving current loving relationships and mending hurting relationships. You are a few pages away from beginning the process of creating lasting ""Unbreakable Bonds"" with family and friends, and maybe even finding new love."
1,This is not the original Misfits,"The Doors aren't the doors without Jim Morrison, Nirvana isn't Nirvana without Kurt Cobain and The Misfits aren't the Misfits without Glen Danzig. The original Misfits featured Glen Danzig on vocals and after he left the following incarnations were garbage. In my mind there is no Misfits without Glen. End of story. Don't listen to any of the others here, they dont know jack."
5,Great Cards,"Hope this helps someone, when i checked my status on www.rebatestatus.com and further delving, I found that a rebate house managed my rebate, continental promotions group.I love my cards performance in my Canon Digital Rebel and while i had to wait a bit longer than i think i should have, i did receive my rebate.From other rebate experiences, I have had similar delays also. I would imagine most of these card manufacturers use such management houses to process.Stacymom2"
1,If only the company was as reliable as the card.,"The compact flash card works, but X Digital Media, inc is a shady company not willing to fulfill any rebates and stone walls its clients. Check google to see all the complaints."
2,Great card - but way overpriced (since they don't pay their rebate),"Card works great .... but don't expect your rebate.They simply refused to fulfill it, after weeks of promising. Know they simply don't answer the phone or return phone/email messages.The LA Better Business Bureau (www.labbb.com) gives them a rating of ""F"""
1,Denied Rebate,I too bought the X Digital Media 1 GB REDLINE PROformance 70X Compact Flash Card because of the $50 rebate touted by Amazon.com. I too was told that my rebate was not received in time even though I sent it immediately after receiving the product and even paid extra to receive the card in 2 days so that I could meet the terms and conditions of the rebate. Stay away from manufacturers rebates unless the company you are purchasing from will stand by the rebate. They offered the rebate as an incentive for purchase and should insure that the rebates are paid.
3,Middle of The Road,"Over the last several years I have purchased many rhyming dictionaries looking for the one I like the most. This is one of the first books I tried. This particular book is somewhat generic in nature and is plain. It seems that some words are left out. This book would be good for a required book in a college class. It gives you basics plus it is affordable. But if you want something comprehensive, plus full of information on rhyming, there are better books out there."
4,Very enoyable,"This is a very enjoyable read! I would categorize it as a light read for a murder mystery. At the end I was excited to go on to read the next book inthe series Gilded Death. Knowledge of Newport is not requried to enjoy the book, but having it adds to the experience. I recommend this book."
5,All you need,"Simple item, no need to spend more. had this one for 3 months with no problems would recommend. fg hg fgg"
5,One of the best trance/progressive house CD's,"For some reason Amazon lists the same CD set three times. All three New York CD's contain the same tracks unless I'm mistaken. I thought I'd review on this selection to offset the last two misguided reviews (sure everyone's got an opinion, but...).I have listened to a lot of DJ mixes by Oakenfold and others, and this mix is hands down one of the best. This is definitely one of the top three releases from Oakenfold (Transport and Residence being the other two). It just doesn't get smoother than the 1st 5 tracks of the first CD. These two CD's are not banging peak time records like most of Resident is, for example. However, one need not dismiss the mix for that reason. Any objective listener will realize this is a great mix of trance and progressive house tracks and is one of the most cohesive sounding 2 CD mix sets I own.I personaly would regard Oakenfold a couple of notches lower if not for this effort."
5,Dynamic Bootie,"I purchased this bootie, first in Scarlett (Red Patent), then Black and recently in Navy Blue Patent. This boot is very high, but so comfortable to wear. It is a beautiful boot to look at and walk in. I get so many compliments when I wear them. I first saw them in Navy Patent at Macy's, but they didn't have my size and I didn't want to pay over $100 anyway. I saw the Scarlett pair through Amazon and purchased them from Street Moda at a very reasonable price. When I received them, I couldn't believe how beautiful they were. I then checked Amazon from time to time and purchased the black pair through Amazon and checked back and found that the Navy pair was being sold by Amazon. I love all of my Booties in every color that I own. I'm waiting for the Off White ones to come back in in my size. Keep selling shoes Amazon."
4,Great for Coffee,"This was a gift. The receiver said that it is a good product, seems to work quite well for the way it is designed. He plans on using it frequently in the future."
5,Great Learning Software,"My 4-year-old really likes this software, along with Millie and Bailey's Preschool. The games are fun and challenging and my daughter has learned from playing it. She recognizes numbers well, has improved her counting skills, and can even count by 5s (5, 10, 15, 20, etc.) from playing these games. The games are fun enough to be engaging and educational enough to feel you aren't leaving your child to play ""mindless video games."""
5,HOTTEST RAP COMP OF 2000/01,"YO, this is one of the hottest Cd's in 2000/01. The production is outstanding and the rhymes are even better. Every one should pick it up.I never met them but the KNOTZ have class and bring a new meaning to Rap they are true emcee's."
1,Not worth the money...,"I've been playing GW since the days of 3rd edition, and my friends and family have been playing since 1st edition. I'm trying to figure out why I have to buy two $35 books just to play a new (and less entertaining) version of a game where I could spend $25 on ONE book and get all the information I need (and be provided with years of entertainment) without having to buy supplemental books. This is one of the reasons I never managed to get into the D&D system. I'd have to buy the player's handbook, DM's handbook, monster manual, and different books depending on what type of character I had. Gamma World has prided itself on being an all-inclusive gaming system, whether or not the gaming was based off of other rules systems (Alternity, for example). When 5th edition came out (Alternity), I bought it within 20 minutes of reading through the pages, but with the new version, I hesitate to even recommend it to anyone."
2,Drop side very loud,"When we bought this crib, my husband and I were very impressed with the quality of the wood and of the assembly. It was great while our son was a newborn, and we kept the drop side down at all times. But once he started to roll over, we had to put the side up when he was in the crib. Now he's almost 7 months, has a hard time falling (and staying!) asleep on his own, especially during the day, and we curse the crib every time we put him down asleep and the sound of the drop side clicking into place wakes him up. No amount of tightening screws or spraying silicone on the drop side tracks makes a bit of a difference. Don't be fooled by the nice looks and the versatility of this crib - none of them matter, if you can't get your baby to stay asleep when putting him down."
3,in all honesty...,"its a great album full of awesome classic motown hits, but like all remastered albums its so full of hiss and distortion that it hurts to listen to it at a loud volume. give me the old classic originals. they may be low volume but at least when you crank it up theres no static or anything."
5,great album,"This is a rocking album. It has an upbeat energy and some interesting arrangements. If you have a chance to see these guys live, DO IT. They put on a kickass show."
1,Atrocious,"This phone and the Nextel service is atrocious. If you want a quality product with good customer service, DO NOT buy anything from Nextel. Constant static, loss of signal, dropped calls, the whole bit. Don't even try to talk to their customer support about your issues... it's like talking to someone on the other end of one of my dropped calls."
3,What did you say?,"The big reason I got this phone was because of the camera. Not that I use it much but I figured that it would be useful when I was out and about and saw a neat idea and could snap a picture.I've had no problems with the phone after 1.5 years of use but the speaker on it is lousy. I have a hard time hearing people compared to other cell phones.Nextel service rocks though, at least in my area. And I've never had a problem with customer service. Get Nextel and get this phone if you have superior hearing.Oh, I wish it also had a vibrate AND ring feature. You can only do one or the other. Unless newer code allows it. Not a major turn off though."
4,I love mine,"I've had this phone for seven months now and have only two (minor) complaints. The outer case scratches very easily (my old Sony Ericsson was tougher than nails) and the service. I live across the river from Canada and pick up their Telus signal a lot (is there a way to lock out roam?). Other than that...great phone, I'm on it constantly. I love that when using the DC, you can turn the speaker off so it's not so distracting to others. I love the ability to add more ringtones and set personalized ringtones for your contacts. I put everything going on in my life in the organizer, if I don't have my phone, I don't know where I'm supposed to be (and it reminds me of events). Definitely invest in a car charger, mine has been priceless. I can't wait to see what the merger with Sprint will bring to the table."
1,Panned by Latest Research,"I used to think this helped me, but quit taking it because of fear of clogged arteries. No difference in joint pain. Now Swiss researches have concluded it has little/no value in reducing arthritis pain - confirming an NIH conclusion in 2005. On the good side, however, researchers also said that there is a strong placebo effect in helping arthritis pain - so, if you believe in it enough, . . ."
2,"Fine, if you like a 2 3/4' monopod","I think I purchased it at a camera shop (shame on them) a few years ago. The upper part is quite solid, and the screw-to-tighten system is tedious and time consuming. The bottom telescoping portion is worthless--it will support the camera, but while waiting to take the next shot, I tend to rest my arms, hands, or whatever, slightly on the unit and it can't take any pressure at all. I WILL telescope in and collapse. I used the neck strap system at a couple of soccer games, but wasn't too excited about it. As my camera has a multi position screen, I really enjoy being able to hold the mounted camera high above my head with the screen facing down at me and getting a bird's eye view and bypassing the backs of everybody's heads! This is probably the only practical use for this item.I am looking into a more reliable monopod."
5,The absolutely necessary coin book.,"This book by R.S. Yeoman is called the ""redbook"" by coin collectors. It's been around for decades and is a comprehensive volume of all U.S. coins including colonial coins, U.S. mint coins from 1793, and even Hawaiian coins. No serious collector/dealer is without a redbook. It's also good for beginners as it has good pictures, shows the position of mintmarks, shows mintages, and lists prices. Each type has a section on grading also."
4,Set screws are too small,"This fuse holder is great, except for one detail. The set screws diameter is too little for the size of the contact tubes. This is fine for solid cable, but creates a problem with stranded cables, where it tends to push strands to the sides, away from the compression zone.Also, depending on the cable used, the enclosed set screws may be too short. The enclosed screws are 7/16""-long. For smaller cables you may require set screws up to 3/4""-long. The set screw thread size is 3/8""-24 (fine)."
4,as described,excellent construction very well made protects exposed wires perfectly just a little large is all almost 3 times the size of a standard 4 awg inline fuse would definately recommend for others to buy fits my 0 awg power wire perfectly. if you need a larger inline fuse bigger than 4 awg look no further.
1,One too MANY Flaws,"...These kinds of bands come by the dime-a-dozen these days all wanting to cash in on some worthless music trend that takes no talent, not to mention that is satuarted by the Media, Mainstream Record Companies, and Fans themselves. I'm sorry people, but I just don't buy into this kinda thing. May be I'm too ""old"" and how could I be when I'm only 19, but I can see past the whole image and see there is NO music talent or actul Metal music in this band. ..."
1,This is not good,"Flaw has put out a cd that is slow and boring, I can't understand why anyone would like this. Through the Eyes is an hour of nothing but waiting for the songs to come alive. They never do."
3,Solid effort; good debut (3 STARS),"Okay, so Flaw may just be another nu-metal band. But what you have to give them is that they do it RIGHT. They aren't so conscerned with acquiring a look that cries for attention (think Slipnot, Mudvayne) or screaming their throats bloody (Slipnot again, Glassjaw) to forget about melody, thought, musicianship, and a good all-around element.Though many of the songs run together in a same-key, same-intensity hum, there are several standouts as well. ""What I Have to Do,"" ""My Letter,"" and ""Whole"" are something that will not be heard elsewhere; they are unique and unlike most any other nu-metal. Unfortunately, songs like ""Payback,"" ""Out of Whack,"" and ""One More Time,"" though good, are not anything new or noteworthy. The band has a lot of potential, and future albums could be something to behold, particularly if they can be produced better than the industrial drone, courtesy of David Bottrille. Overall: Good 6 out of 10."
4,Rock/ Metal w/ v. good Vocals,"The lead singer has good melodic voice, and the vocal harmonizations are the best that I have heard since Alice in Chain's ""Dirt"". The lyrics themselves are not the run-of-the-mill numetal fair. They seem heartfelt and meaningful, and the meaning is expressed even more thoroughly through the singer's voice. Everything comes together best in the song ""Only the Strong Survive"", the first track on the CD."
1,Don't waste your money,"I had high hopes this CD would contain the content I wanted to really be able to create killer spreadsheets without the normal time involved in discovering a program's true potential. Wrong!From the first insertion of the CD (it wouldn't auto-start) to the loading of each successive lesson (the vocal playback of the animated character remained garbled for some time before it would clear up), I got more and more frustrated. It would even skip whole lesson sections that I did not discover until a successive lesson mentioned something I had not heard before. Searching back, I had to find the missing lesson and manually click it to start.I learned more just loading up the Excel software and ""noodling"" with it for about 20-30 minutes.In short: A real disappointment."
1,The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers,"this is the game for Lord Of Da Rings hardcore fans, not video gamers."
1,WHAT IS THIS!!!!!!!,"I got the lord of the rings: the two towers not fellowship of the ring!!!! the majority of this game is the aragorn telling some woman about what happened in the fellowship. the graphics suck and the transitions from live action to CGI are terrible, the colors are off and the positions are off. the live actiion cut scenes are terrible too. THIS GAME SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Not as much fun as Fellowship of the Rings,I'd recommend getting Fellowship of the Rings for PS2 instead. I prefer games that are more open and less linear. The Fellowship graphics version just looks far less washed out.
2,i heard this wasn't the best,"a friend of mine got a hold of the game, and i have to say, after the first couple plays, it wasn't mindblowing, by any means. of course the graphics are good, and the gameplay is decent, but i think i'm lost since i haven't read the book (and obviously haven't seen the movie). maybe after some more play it'll improve, but after a couple hours i wasn't too impressed. i have the x-box version, and maybe i'm biased by x-box games in general, but the graphics and sound are killer, which makes me lean toward that one as opposed to the PS2 version. maybe it'll change later, but after first glance i'd say x-box gets the nod here."
3,Not as good as the Xbox version,"I got a chance to play both the PS2 ""The Two Towers"" and the Xbox ""Fellowship of the Ring"" at E3 this year. The two towers is pretty much straight-up sword fighting from what I can tell. It doesn't seem to have the breadth and scope of the more story-based Xbox game.The graphics are beautiful, yes, but the combat in the game seemed a little too chaotic (maybe it was just the level they were showing at E3) and the controls just a little bit sluggish.In the Xbox game, there is more story and more sense of the true beauty of Middle Earth. I guess it comes down to this: The Two Towers is a straight-forward action game, whereas the Fellowship of the Ring on Xbox is more action/adventure."
2,A Wonderful Idea Lacking Development,"I was extremely excited to play this game when I first received it. However, when I began to play, I found that it was extremely boring. Fighting. That's it. I, personally, enjoy role-playing games better than fighting games, but that's just me. I would recommend renting it, rather than buying it, or at least doing so BEFORE buying it. You may be pleased or disappointed. I guess it depends of the personality of the player."
1,best game but...........................,this game is good. i love facing the urks and i love to play it like the movie. but it does get a little bit boring after a while. dont get this game if u arent sure about it..
4,Welcome to Middel Earth!!!,"The Two Towers is a great action game and can also be appreciated for it's extremly good graphics and game control. You can choose to play as Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli and Isiuldur, who is exactly the same as Aragorn. You can play in 9 great memorabel locations from the films spread across 13 action packed levels. This game did go by fast for me and with very little challange. But it is still great fun and I highly recomend it for a great orc bashing time!"
5,the two towers,the game is great you get to battle all typs of orcs. and your have all types of moves you have moves that break sheilds and bow and arrows. and get get to up grade moves the only thing bad about this game is that when you are battling orcs you are by our self aginst about 50.but this is agood game.
4,Who the hell is ISILDUR???,"This is not a review but i'll tell you what:I THINK THIS IS THE HELL OF A FUN GAME EVEN THOUGH I DON'T HAVE IT YET!!! Anyway this is just a question i am making to Mike Hunt or anyone who knows the answer. Ok here it goes:Who the hell is ISILDUR?I wanna know who the secret character is that's why i'm asking since Mike Hunt said it was him and i don't know who he is,(and yes i saw the movie)i gotta know every character in the game before playing."
3,overrated,"When i rented this game i thought it was gonna be great. It turned out ok. It's overrated. First thing, when you are in a huge battle it gets very frustrating b/c your team mates never help out. Either you end up dying very quickly or the bad guys get through to the people that you are trying to protect. Plus there are a lot of bad guys so when you go after one you get knocked down and you are always on the ground if you don't run away. This game is pretty fun, but they show too much of the movie which takes too long. This game has cool graphics, but the camera angles suck. If i were you i would rent it first b/c a lot of people like this game, but i found it frustrating."
1,THIS GAME REALY SUCKS,"THIS GAME REALY [is bad] AND I DONT LIKE ITTHE STORY LINE IS SHORT AS ALL ANY ONE CAN BEAT IT UNDER 3HOURSEVEN MY LITTLE BROTHER WHO IS ONLY 4 BEAT IT, WAY TOO EASY NO CHALLAGE AT ALL"
2,Unsatisfying...,"Ok, folks here it is, if you're thinking about buying this game, pick up Gauntlet Dark Legacy instead. This game is the perfect example of how video game companies will try to capitolize on anything they can get thier greedy littl hands on without putting any effort into trying to make a game that's even slightly interesting. The combat is monotonous, the levels are straight out of the first two movies, so if you've seen them, there's really nothing to motivate you to try and finish the game. The controls are unresponsive... do you need to know anything else?"
4,Simple hack and slash game,"I bought this game the week it came out and I was disappointed. This game is really simple and easy. An average gamer could beat it in about 2 days it they put there attention into it. The game is simple you can either be gimli, strider, or legolas for most levels. You go around killing orcs and Uruk hais and after completing a level you get a rating. The rating can be fair, good, exellent, or perfect. Then you can purchase new moves, and weapons with the points that you earn. This increases your level, too. The moves are awesome except for the fact that you don't need them. Most of the times you are going to be hitting on the same button repeatedly and have the same effect as the special moves do. This is why I am giving it 4 stars. Other than that the game is awesome except for the occasional dumb camera. It has a lot of unlockables and a bonus level. So go out and buy this game it is not only for a LOTR fan but for anyone who likes a decent hack and slash."
5,It Beats the Alternative!,"I don't think any of us love getting older, but -- if we are lucky -- age does happen. This is a quote book that puts life and the the passing of time into perspective. I bought a copy for a birthday present because I liked the title, but before I wrapped it, I read it. The next day I bought a copy for myself. It is one of those books you can go back to time and time again."
4,Be My Mummy by Josie Metcalfe (Large Print Mills & Boon Medical Romance),"Description from the book back cover:A Special Mother ...

Lauren is upset to find the new staff member is Jack, who has a small son, as Lauren discovers when Danny is brought into hospital with appendicitis.

2,Hard to read,"I could not get into this book at all, even with the fact that Ellen Douglas was a fellow Greenvillian."
3,VERY WELL MADE BUT PROBLEMATIC,"THIS IS A VERY STURDY PIECE OF DECORATED PLASTIC THAT IS WELL MADE AND KEEPS THE WATER IN THE SHOWER OR TUB AND OFF THE FLOOR. HOWEVER, IT DOES NOT, IN MY EXPERIENCE, STAY ON THE SHOWER ROD WHEN IT IS MOVED, AND I HAVE BEEN DEALING WITH SHOWER CURTAINS FOR 40 YEARS...STATIONARY, IT LAYS FINE. BUT WHEN MOVING IT TO THE LEFT OR RIGHT TO ENTER THE SHOWER, IT REGULARLY FALLS OFF THE RINGS ON ONE SIDE OR THE OTHER, AND CAN BE VERY FRUSTRATING. HOWEVER, FOR THE PRICE, NOT BAD AT ALL."
4,Hookless Butterfly Vinyl Shower Curtain,This product is great. The no hook feature is really nice and it is very easy to use. I use it for a cover to my dorm closet and it is just wonderful.
