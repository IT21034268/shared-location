4,A Great Novel That Ends with a Fizzle,"I suppose Steve Martini was going for an unexpected ending when he wrote this novel, but to me it almost seems like a cop-out.Don't let that dissuade you, though, if you're a fan of legal/thriller novels. The amount of detail and research put into this novel by Steve Martini is incredible and makes the book very, very believable. Also, the court room drama is engaging and precise due to Martini's own experience as a lawyer.The bottom line: for anyone who enjoys government/military/legal thrillers, I highly recommend this novel. You won't be disappointed... unless you expect a huge ending like I did."
3,Found Lacking at Best,"Interesting novel. Overall, Double Tap has all the ingredients for a fantastic novel but is found lacking in character development. The ending is too simplistic. It appears that Martini was rushed into publication for this novel. No where near as interesting as a good Ludlam novel. Comes very close to the ""Once upon a time"" story telling ability."
4,"Courtroom Questioning right on...plot, a little far-fetched","Martini writes a great book to take on a plane or short vacation. The ""government conspiracy"" plot is a little overused these days, however, the courtroom drama and ""freebies"" that trial attorneys get during the ebb and flow of witness testimony leads me to believe that Martini spends a lot of time in the courtroom listening.I've sat in the defense counsel chair many times, waiting for the magic moment in testimony, to pounce. But as Martini ably points out, most of the luck and reward comes from the preparation, the thinking, the brainstorming, the responses you get when a subpeona is served. Overall, an entertaining and well-written book."
1,"Greatly titled, poorly written.","I purchased this book due to the interesting nature of the title, and the on-line reviews.I found the opening scene interesting, but soon after became highly disenchanted with the writing. I found it bland and cliched. It reminded me of early works by Dan Brown which have been re-released due to the success of his newest title. (Hint: they were not previously succesful for a reason.)I returned this book for The Historian within one week. Unique, lush writing and a highly enjoyable read thus far."
5,Cute songs,"This is a great song book for the very young. I had a Wee Sing book for my own children, and I purchased this one for my granddaughter. I would buy it again."
2,Did not match my skin tone,"This product is said to work on all skin types. That is not a true statement. I was definitely not satisfied with this product. I was excited about getting it. I used it as soon as it arrived, and was totally let down. I would not suggest this product for darker skin tone women."
5,Excellent combination of history and anthropology.,"T.R. Fehrenbach's The Comanches is a wonderful, unflinching look at a powerful yet tragic tribe of Indians. The thing that separates Fehrenbach from other history writers is his use of anthropology.He explains why these and other Indians did not evolve beyond the Stone Age. For teachers like myself it helps to know why geography and culture(not race) influence different peoples' actions."
2,Not what I expected,"I've read many books on the American Indian, and since Comanches lived and died in my area of the United States I thought this would be a very interesting book. I found it dull dull dull."
1,Comanches,I've read other books about American Indians and have seen how it can be done well. This is the worst book on any group of American Indians that I have ever seen. The auther starts out with 100 or more pages of anthropological speculation that he unqualified and unfit to enter into. If you make it through this first grueling hundred pages or so you find a book that is hamstrung by the authors bias. Don't waste your money on this book.
5,Clay does it again.,"How can this man continually get better? That's what I ask myself everytime I play both of the songs on this CD. They are both pure ""masterpieces"". I watched Clay perform ""Solitaire"" on ""American Idol"" last night. It's apparent that he is so far above this show. He is a true super star!"
5,Speechless in NY,Turn off the lights. Light some candles. Put on the headphones. Prepare yourself for a vocal journey like you've never experienced before. Simply stunning.
2,Here's My Review,Good singing but whoever wrote the lyrics is horrible;the music scratched my ears. I think some of the songs are a littletoo feminine for a guy to sing.
5,The Way / Solitaire,"Love it! Love it! Love it! The Way is a beautiful love song with an amazing message. Clay's best on his album Measure of a Man.Solitaire. Words seem to escape me, I was completely speechless after I heard it. Such emotion, this is the most powerful song I believe I have ever heard. Clay's voice is just magnificent. His range is unbelievable. Gave me chills and brought me to tears."
5,Clay gets better and better!,"I love ""The Way"", but Clay's version of ""Solitaire"" is incredible! This young man just gets better and better! I can't wait for his next full album."
5,Clay Aiken brings it again!,"Once again Clay Aiken really shows the true talent he has for making us feel as though we have heard a song for the first time. His rendition of Solitaire is amazing. Enough said, go buy several copies and make all of your friends happy!"
5,WOW,"Once again Clay has out done himself. He just gets better and better. I'm proud of this young man for what he stands for, his beliefs, and voice. It's about time that someone of this caliber reach the top 50 list. Anyone from a senior citizen, to a child, can listen and not be afraid of any off colored words."
5,Clay does it again!!!!!!!!!!!,Both songs are truly amazing. He just has a voice that I would want to listen to over and over again. Clay thanks again for an fantasic preformance!!!
1,I Didn't Know John Edwards Sang as Clay Aiken!,"John Edwards is Clay Aiken, albeit with a better suit... but I bet the lawyer sings better...Also, regarding previous reviews note: ""Alabama""... 'nuff said."
1,Solitaire,"to old school for me, clay has a nice voice, but nothing to write home to mom about, plus he's not on the top of the charts anymore, what's up with that, last year he was in the #1 spot every week, but not anymore..on billboard his solitaire has drop down from four last week to twenty seven this week, well maybe his time has come for him to retire, and go back to teaching...I'm sure he like's that better anyway."
5,GRAMMY FOR BEST MALE VOCAL IN THE CARDS!!,"Clay more that proves that he was (IS) the 'rightful' owner of the title ""American Idol"" with this recording. What a beautiful rendition of a beautiful song. Neil Sedaka must be glowing! Who cares if this gets a lot of airplay, just drink in the gorgeous, glorious sounds eminating from this little circle of plastic on your own audio player."
5,HOT HOT HOT!,The man with the golden voice who knows what his fans like. Thank you Clay Aiken for all you have done for mankind and for giving me this beautiful music to listen to. This single ROCKS! Buy it you will not be disappointed.
5,Awesome CD,"This CD is soooooo good!!! Two wonderful but different songs. The Way is so romantic about being in love, & The Way is a very good song, especially sung by Clay. Solitaire . . . words fail me but I will try. Solitaire is about love lost & is hauntingly beautiful. Clay sings it with such emotion. The glory note about 3/4 of the way into Solitaire . . . blows me away every time. Solitaire stirs up such emotion in the listener. I highly recommend this CD!!!!!"
2,Worked well - but fell apart,"I had this vacuum for 2 years and it still works, but I can't use it.The handle was always a weak point and it eventually broke - so I have been using it duct taped together, which was ok until the area where the bottom connects to the body also broke, rendering it useless. I am going to have to add it to a landfill and buy a new one. I am disappointed since it was nice and light - good for carrying up to our loft and small enough to fit in the closet and powerful enough to clean up cat hair."
5,Madame Bovary,"I think that this French guy Flaubert has a future in writing.It's a shame he can't write in ""la langue barbare"" (i.e. en Anglais )."
3,Equality Is Better,This is a classic worth reading. I saw:That a society which pursues equality is better.Women have not had rights for long in the western world.We can die from broken hearts.And More
3,Problems with translation but good value for money.,"The aforementioned footnotes didn't bother me too much, but there are quite a few odd word choices and blatant transpositions in the text. Not enough to ruin the reading experience, but enough to make you go ""huh?"" at least once a chapter (i.e. a pony ""gambling"" in the pasture instead of ""gamboling"") especially if you are unused to older translations with archaic usages.That being said, this was my first experience with the book and I felt like I got all of the author's intention from it - the word choices aren't lazy, just old-fashioned. And when all's said and done, isn't that the important thing?"
3,Pretty Good Book,"Throughout the entire book I kept thinking I didn't like it, but looking back on it I liked it. It is a slow read. I would recommend this to people who like Classic Literature.Basically this book follows the gradual decline of a woman, dragging down everyone else with her."
1,Madame Bovary,Much to heavy reading. Lost interest after just reading the first chapter. But at that cost who can complain. Actually was trying to compare it to the movie.
2,OK...But not the panacea,"It does assist in the opening of the jars but it takes a lot of effort to get it its teeth into the lid in the first place. It needs some sort of ratcheting mechanism to be effective. If you can't twist the jar counter-clockwise, you would have as much of problem twisting it clockwise!"
5,You don't think you need it until you have one!,"I am a strong and take pride in that fact. However, my pride gets shattered every time I have to ask my husband to open a jar for me. Really spaghetti sauce manufacturers, what are you thinking? I bought this item because I needed a 4th item in my 4:3 promotion, and it seemed like a lot of money a the time for something seemingly frivolous.Let me tell you, it's well worth the money, and I don't know what I did without it. MOst jars I can open without a problem, but it is a bummer when you are about to make your favorite recipe and you can't get your chopped garlic open. This has solved that for me. 9 times out of 10 it opens those troublesome jars really easily. Occasionally, I still have to get old school with it and bang the jar on the counter. And then this thing will be sure to do the trick after that. There are so much better uses for your grip strength - save yourself some trouble and get one of these. You'll be glad you did."
5,Fantastic Jar Opener,"The Kuhn Rikon The Gripper Jar Opener is a fantastic product that I have used almost every day for several years. Now, my daughter is having trouble with the grip in her hands and I have ordered one for her. It is so easy to use and opens many sizes of lids. GREAT PRODUCT!!"
5,marion,"Last of the Summer Wine: Vintage 1990have too see this series to love it they are the best bbc dvd that will keep you laughing for hours , three old dudes wondering around and just having fun!!!"
5,What a great ending to a great trilogy!,"Now that the Techno-mage trilogy is complete I can say that this in one of the best Sci-Fi series of all times. As I said in a review of an earlier book in the series the Techno-mages had been one of my least favorite aspects of the Babylon 5 universe. However, Jeanne Cavoelos brought them alive, placed them in perfect context in the sweep of Bablyon 5 history and wrote an exciting narrative. With all we now know about Galen and the Techno-mages I hope they play a role in the new Rangers series and I hope that the story arc started in the short lived Crusade series is somehow continued (in book form, written by Jeanne Cavoelos?)."
3,Tools needed,My swing set has blown around the yard quite a few times with all the tornadoes here lately so I decided it was finally time to anchor it down. The pieces that screw into the ground refuse to screw in. They just go a few inches in and then start plowing the dirt up. Since they won't go in I guess they don't work. I'm going to have to dig a hole and pour concrete around the anchors to get them to work. Not ideal.
2,No directions!,There are absolutely no directions for the item save for one picture on the box. The pieces that look like pipe straps are easy to bend but nearly impossible to get the the shape you need them. It was easier to forget about those and use the rest of the packaged pieces.
3,Made in China,Flimsy thin metal......it works for one season. cheaply made.....they advertise it is all USA but it denotes CHINAA on the box. Really misleading.
4,Great reference - but it is a reference,"I am a software developer with 15 yrs experience, been a Java developer for the last 7. Never worked in a heavy UML environment but have been required to put together class diagrams and wanted to learn more about other UML features. This book is not a cookbook, a how-to, or a learning guide, so if you need to learn and use UML in a heavy-duty way this book is not the right one. However, this book is great as an overview and reference, and it allows me to speak intelligently about UML and understand diagrams. Certainly would recommend it for other developers who wish to have a working understanding of UML."
1,Give me a break,"Pure garbage. I can't believe they tried to pass this off as non-fiction. The only part I actually bought was the author's impotence; the rest of the book is macho overcompensation for this genital malfunction. Boring, with laughably bad prose and cliched characters that the author actually expects his readers to believe are based on real people, which is insulting. I can't believe this moron had the nerve to compare himself to Dave Eggers in an interview.Frey is an example of a spoiled, rich brat who used his parents' money and connections to have his crap published. See Tiffany Debartalo's 'God-Shaped Hole' for another example of a mind-bogglingly terrible novel published because the ""writer"" has rich parents. It's an alarming trend."
2,All things being equal,"Fiction or non-fiction, it doesn't matter. It was a poorly-written account of addiction. Oprah originally called the book ""riveting""? I'd call it boring. I mean how many times to we have to beat this dead horse? Every addict or alcoholic that I've ever spoken with comes out of rehab, sober for the moment, thinking that they can write a book. BORRRRRRIIIINNGGG! I'll give Frey two-stars for at least finishing it. That's an accomplishment. Fortunately, his career is finished as well."
1,Don't Waste Your Time!,"I was so excited to read this book after all the ""can't put it down"" hype. Because there was a wait list at the library I purchased the book because I couldn't wait to read it. My advice is, if you're that curious, borrow it from the library rather than wast your money. Can't put it down?! I could more than easily put it down from the first page forward. It is EXTREMELY repetitive. So he vomits AGAIN. ZZZZZzzzzzz. Quite the opposite of gripping."
1,I knew this book was full of it when..,"I was reading it last year and got up to the scene where the dentist refuses to give him anaesthetic for his root canal out of concern that he would relapse into drug addiction. I knew this couldn't possibly be true. It was like a ripoff of Marathon Man. At that point, I realized I'd been had and threw the book away in disgust.I acquired the book accidentally in a mistaken book club shipment and decided to give it a try. The narrator is an annoying spoiled rich kid, extremely unsympathetic. Like most junkies, he's boring. He has no interests except himself. The writing is tedious. When I caught my neighbour reading it on the subway I actually asked him in disbelief, ""You LIKE that book?"" (He said yes. God knows why.)Come on, no anaesthetic for a root canal? You'll need an anaesthetic..preferably some hard drugs..in order to enjoy this ridiculous, overheated, overhyped book."
1,People believe this?,"The minute I hit the part about the priest in Paris, I knew something smelled funny. Well, it was a tossup between that and the conveniant suicide of Lilly, just a few hours before Frey's release. If it were just the one incident, he'd get away with it, but taken all together the book gives off the odor of trying too hard. It all reads like your basic movie-of-the-week, except with more vomit."
1,Turned down as fiction - for a reason,"As a true account of an individual's struggle to overcome multiple addictions and personal demons, this book would be an incredible work if even half of it were true. As an almost completely fictitios account, it is not only an average, cliched read, but also an utter insult to those who have actually struggled with and overcome addiction.There's a reason multiple publishers turned it down as a work of fiction."
1,Wasn't impressed,True or not true......I just did not like this book. This is the first book that I've put down and didn't finish. Even bad books I'll read until the end because I don't like to leave things unfinished. This one just wasn't worth it. The language the writing got on my last nerve and it truthfully (no pun intended) made me feel dirty.I don't recommend reading this. The comments on this site are much more entertaining.
3,Yikes!!,"I heard about this book on Oprah and had to check it out, not knowing at all the subject matter. I was intrigued and couldn't read enough. I am a recovering addict/alcoholic myself and found that I related with him in a lot of areas. At times I too had to cringe and shake off the brash manner in which he writes. I will never feel the same about the dentist! The problem I have is with all the attention this book is getting, he may influence people taking the traditional way of recovering (12 steps) the newly sober, looking for the 'loop hole'. With every page I turned I was waiting for the light to come on...Be careful with this book...not everyone, if anyone can get sober Frey's way."
5,Very compelling,"Yes, I did get this book after seeing it featured on the Oprah Show. For some reason maybe this is viewed as ""not literary"". No matter, people who dismiss this book based on the fact that Oprah chose it are missing out. This book is gripping, plain and simple. You feel like you are there with Mr. Frey for every agonizing step of his journey through rehab. His tale is that of a true survivor, one with strength and fortitude that are incomprable once he chooses to fight his unimaginable addictions. I haven't had a sheltered life, so I feel like not much could shock me, but there are some passages in this book that made my eyes pop out of my head. You root for Mr. Frey throughout his journey, even though his success is evidenced by the publication of his memoir. Other addicts turn out to be not so lucky, unfortunately. I definitely loved this book."
4,good read,It Does not matter if it is based on fact or fiction the book was entertaining to read. Was a definate page turner.
1,Rebel against this Fraud. Sell your book used,"I read this book thinking I was reading a true story. Then I read Thesmokinggun.com and saw that it's mostly fiction. As fiction, it's not strong. Americans are suckers for anything called ""a true story."" Threre's a sucker born every minute, and everytime someone buys this book, they become one. In any case, one has to wonder if anyone reading this book ever stopped to think. Can a guy get on a plane and fly somewhere dripping blood, with missing teeth, drunk and unable to move? Really? For all of those, like me, who have seen the true suffering the the mentally ill and the addiction; for those of us who know that, in truth, most people don't make it out when they're that deep in hell. For those who actually care about the truth, this book is a huge slap in the face. Sell your copies used."
1,A Million Little Pieces,"Well, the book was entertaining. Since I purchased the bood just prior to Mr. Frey being outed by the smoking gun. And finished it just before Oprah's revenge on Mr. Frey.The book itself if it were true would have been Pulitzer Prize worthy.Now, it's just another fictional book."
2,Not what I expected.,"Unfortunately I didn't read this book until after all the hype about parts of the ""truth"" being embellished. I'd already seen/heard so much negative publicity that I was a sceptic from page one. I didn't find the book ""hard to put down"" as so many before me had claimed. The book actually took me a week or so to read. For a fictional novel.. it wasn't one of the best I've read.So, did the negative publicity hurt James Frey? I personally think it did."
3,Good story ...although it is not all true,This is a great book but now we know that all of the facts are not true as described in the book and some are just there to make the book better. I found it was a fast read though and I read it before I heard that it was not all true.
4,Controversial book a good read,"This book was selected for my book club before its authenticity was questioned, and we began reading it after we learned it was not all the author had promised. I did enjoy it, though, and treated it as fiction. James Frey's style of writing conjured up a real picture of an institution filled with a cross section of drug users who were real to the reader, with most becoming an ally and friend to the narrator. Because he admittedly embellished some scenarios and blended certain events, the book should not be considered as an aid for drug abusers seeking inspiration in overcoming their addictions."
2,Who is He Kidding ???,"I started reading this book before the revelation that Mr Frey ""embellished"" (aka LIED) throughout his ""memoir"" and while I agree that the story is well-written, Mr Frey has lost all of his credibility. After the first 10 pages or so, ""Million Little Pieces"" reads like the script for a ""Lifetime"" or ""Oxygen"" channel movie. Mr Frey's ""I'm a Victim"" shtick may play well on Oprah, but the sympathy factor is running pretty low elsewhere. The characters he meets in rehab, whether real or fictional, give us no reason to care about them. Note to Mr Frey: Grow up and get a life."
1,I PUT IT DOWN !!,"This was a terrible book. Oprah said you wouldn't be able to put it down, but I didn't make it very far. My sister finished it because she was curious of the ending. She said it was a waste of time. The way it ends makes it worse. We didn't pass the book around it was so bad. I do not recommend this book. The fact that the guy straightened out his life was the only good part of the book."
5,Unbelievable ride..,"What a powerful and emotional rollercoaster of a book! I still think about it, feel about it and engage about it after 2 weeks of reading it.James Frey comes across as a thud and monster at the beginning, but as you read and the story unfolds, you also start to see the real James Frey and how real he is.Reading the book, I felt I was right there with him, feeling his pain and his love for Lily. This book is not only about the addiction but also a love story.You must MUST read ""My Friend Leonard"" after you read this book."
3,Did this really happen?,"I just finished the book. Very powerful but not quite believable. Having worked in a rehab facility I can tell you that most of what James describes going on in the hospital would never happen. He gives the impression that he had this strange power over everyone that would allow him to do whatever he wanted without regard for the rules or boundaries set forth in the program. Kind of like his early years at home, refusing to live within the guidelines established by his parents. I hope mom and dad have been reimbursed for all the money they spent confirming James' lifelong belief that he is above any authority and can do everything on his own. I think the greatest benefit realized by James' stay in the hospital is the financial windfall he's now faced with based on Oprah's endorsement. Very resourceful indeed..."
1,A Million Little Lies!,Terribly disappointed about all the lies in this book. More disappointing is the fact that not many people are bothered about the lying and fiction in a supposedly non-fiction book. This book has no redeeming value nor any lessons to be learnt.
3,I didn't really finish reading the book...,"I didn't really finish reading the book but the book came in great condition as promised. The portion that I did read though, was not to my intrest whatsoever."
3,"Liked it, didn't love it","I found the book very interesting and his writing style made me feel as though I was going though what he was going through. I don't care that much that he exagerated some minor points. However, I did find it a bit repetative. Day after day at the clinic... I know that is how it really was, but for the book I think it could have been abreviated."
4,Unsure,"I read this book in one weekend and I am not quite sure what propelled me to keep the pages turning. I don't know whether I really liked to book or whether I was trying to experience all the hype. Unfortunately, I think Oprah ruined my ability to enjoy this book because of all the hype and expectations."
4,Good choice,"This is a book in which I would say 'READ IT'I am the author of Domestic Abuse All Sides, Domestic Abuse Our Stories and Murder in New England & Closing the Circle."
2,Million Little Pieces Review,"While the book was informative of what a drug addict's life may be like on the streets I was very disappointed in the author's ending. While he ""became clean"" in a 12 step program he totally disregarded all of the steps and denounced the program and the value of the 12 steps.I had already purchased the book when the truth came out regarding this author, but wanted to read anyways. It was just disappointing that the help he received he denied in the end."
1,Garden Variety Addiction + Final Draft = Mediocre Memoir,"This is the type of book Vin Diesel would write if you gave him a dictaphone and a pot of coffee.Dear James Frey: The sound you hear coming from the pages of David Foster Wallace is not bells and whistles, but what hard work and intelligence sounds like to the tone deaf.James Frey has said that his next novel is going to be about Jesus, which is fitting, since Frey, much like Jesus before him, lives in a Tribeca loft and wrote the David Schwimmer movie 'Kissing a Fool.'Instead of wasting twenty-five dollars on A Million Little Pieces, go to your local library and borrow Wallace's Infinite Jest. Read the passages that focus on Don Gately.Those who can't let their work speak for itself hire a publicist.James Frey, meet Elizabeth Wurtzel. Maybe when they make a movie out of your life you can star as yourself."
5,James Frey,This book was simply amazing. It is a must read for anyone who has experienced addiction problems as well as relationship ups and downs. James Frey is a genious!!
4,James Frey A Million Little Pieces,"A must read for anyone who has known an addict. The book gives insight into the turmoil and self destruction of the addict/alcoholic. Even if Frey had embellished on some parts, it still sent the message."
1,A drug addict wanna -be,"It would have been so much better if he actually told the truth if he was going to present it as truth! The reader can not help but feel frauded. I know people like the persona he made or stole for the character, and there is nothing amazing or special about being a complete waste of flesh. His character is so self absorbed he can't see how inconsequential a crack head is."
3,"Eh, not for me","It took about a page or two for me to get used to the writing style in James Frey's ""A Million Little Pieces""--it was different and I liked it (it's why I gave this a 3 star rating). However, what I found disconcerting was how Frey's style and his language kept this reader at arm's length. I wanted to feel for these characters, wanted to do more than frown at appropriate times, but I just couldn't connect. Because of that, admittedly, I only read the first few chapters of ""A Million Little Pieces,"" and as such, my review can't be considered anything resembling comprehensive. I simply wanted to make my possibly-skewed opinion known. Maybe, if I'm in the mood at a later date, I'll finish this book, but for now? This will be one of those rare books that I just won't make myself read to the end."
5,A very real account of addiction and recovery,"The author takes readers on a journey starting with the realization that he is in rehab all the way until he is completed with the process. The book is written in a very matter-of-fact way that gets inside Frey's head when he is going through a very rough time in his life. He does a great job of keeping the reader interested by telling the tale in a very vivid format. I can't even imagine going through what he did, but I respect him greatly for it and for sharing."
5,A million little pieces,The reality of addiction wasn't sugar coated and it presented a view of addiction and recovery that is bases on human accountability and acknowledgment of responsibility
4,Good book but...,"It's all a lie.And that makes it a little disappointing to try and read it!Still a good book I suppose, but as an addict you can definitely see the lies in it."
5,Loved it--couldn't put it down.,Say what you want about the guy--he has a plan that works for him. He is honest and I'm so glad he found a way to make a new life for himself when the odds were so against him. I would completely recommend this book--just be prepared to feel some discomfort while reading it!
1,Truly Awful!,"As a recovering addict who has been in 6 treatment centers in 3 different states, I have never seen or heard of the kind of treatment that is described in this book. I am also personal friends with two who went to the clinic named in the book. No one would ever treat addicts receiving treatment as he described. It just isn't done. Had he gone there himself he would know this. I pray that the treatment described doesn't scare off those needing substance abuse treatment.That being said, the book is a good read if you want to read pure fiction. Just know that this is his made up rehab world."
2,A Million LIttle PIeces,I am glad I read the book but struggled with the language in it. Did not think the language was necessary. MOst of the 4 letter f-words could have been left out without losing any of the color or meaning. Did not feel the author warrented the criticisms on his truth in it. Creative fiction is okay and I do believe a lot of people gained insight into addictions by the book.Nancy M.
3,another way to look at addiction,"I am an attorney. Many of my clients have problems with alcohol. This book is informative but if you want to look at alcohol and drug addiction with a totally different perspective, read Beyond Reason by Harvard's Roger Fisher. It can help anyone who is in a relationship with someone who has a drug or alcohol problem. You won't be able to make them better (only they can help themselves), but you will be able to understand more about their emotional state. Beyond Reason helps you to understand your emotions and others. Once you achieve that, you at least have some information that is helpful to you. I have used the information in Beyond Reason with many of my clients. It has helped me very much."
5,Its Grrrrrrrrreat!,"I have never read a book with such a origonal style before. I like the stucture of the book where there are no paragraphs used, only lines are used.The story was great, the caratcters are great, and the book is great."
1,Boring story of a pompous ass,"I purchased and read this book because I have personal experience with the subject. I was actually angry reading it as I didn't think it rang true and I thought it would do a disservice to the struggling addicts who were trying to get and stay clean. Yet everyone raved. Now I am heartened to learn that I you can't fool an old dope fiend, but you can fool people who don't know the reality."
1,"bad writing, etchically challenged","I read this book a few months ago, and thought the writing was poor, but appreciated learning a lttlie bit about one man's experiences with addiction and recovery. Now that I know it is fiction, I don't think there's any reason to read it. The main character is an annoying, seof-aggrandizing liar."
1,A Purported Non-Fictional Account that is Fictional!,"I've read the book and now seen the allegations that James Frey's drug and alcohol memoir ""A Million Little Pieces"" is filled with lies and half-truths, and am besides myself that this fraud has taken place. Whatever happened to the editorial standards at Random House that they could release a book and not check the validity of the material first? And how could Oprah Winfrey and her producers not check the same before she goes on national TV and extols the values of the accounts. What a sham...and a shame!"
5,Hold On James!,HOLD ON James...this too shall pass! I am not an addict and I absolutly loved this/your book!! I loved your writing style. I loved how you took responsibility for your actions. I loved how you didn't play the victim card...how you trusted your own instincts enough to stand up and do what is right for you (not what society or the powers that be say is the only way to recover or the only correct way to write). Your writing style came thru straight from the heart. Keep up the good work...there will always be those who try to tear down someone who bucks the tide of the tradtional thinking man.Go out and buy this book today if you haven't already! Oprah stands by her pick and I do too.
1,Derivative or plagiarist ?,"At a time of considerable controversy in the book world - authors of Holy Blood, Holy Grail versus the author(s) of Da Vinci code - I almost find this to be a larger example of literary plagiarism. The entire tone and subject-matter are so similar to Ken Kesey's One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest as to be virtually indistinguishable."
1,He should not be in the top sellers,I can't believe he is still ranked so high. I do not endorse this book. I have read it. At that time - I thought that it was an ok book - now that I have heard all the news surrounding Frey...I am disappointed. I do not blame the publisher - only the author. He knew better. His books should be pulled off the shelf. Instead - go buy John Michael Forosisky's book called Passenger's Side. IT IS REAL! Great book. A must read!
1,Please...,"So his reality-beggaring recovery memoir turned out to be riddled with falsehoods?No kidding!I've griped to all and sundry about this book and now that the comeuppance has arrived I just feel sort of sick. But not surprised. Oprah's endorsement only reiterated that people will buy anything trendy, whether or not it's true.Would anyone read this dreck if it were offered up as fiction? No, because they would say it wasn't believable!Expect a news story soon on people having their HOLD ON tattoos altered to read COLD ONE."
2,Not What I Expected,"This was a very difficult book to read. There are run-on sentences, intentional, but a hard style to read.It was a book that lead up to a whole lot of nothing. The best part of the book was the at the very end with the summary about what happened to the other people.I sincerely could not read this book again, which was very disappointing because of all the hype. What the hell was Oprah thinking????"
3,Let The Light Shine In!,"The badest of the bad in addiction. A fantastic book for the loved ones of addicts. A hope for those who have totally given up, both the loved ones and the addicted. I know,--been there, done that."
4,A very engaging book!,"I found this book to be very interesting. Parts of it were offensive and a bit uncomfortable to read, BUT it only made me want to read it and get through the experience with James. It made me want to see what was going to happen next and how everything would play out. This book was very good, there is something for everyone to learn from it. This book teaches about many things, control, addiction, love, strength, and much more. I finished the book in 4 days, I did not want to put it down. I can not wait to read MFL, I hope it will be just as good."
5,a Million little Pieces,"I am a Mother who lost her son to a drug overdose I highlyreccomend this book to all who are recovering from addiction of any kind.I never knew until i read this book how devistatingit is to be at the mercy of these Demons. all family membersWho have felt the pain of loss ,due to addiction this will open your eyes to what the people you love go through .no other book i have read brings this pain to light.James Frey lived to tell us what our loved ones could not.I donated my copy to the recovery house in my town with hope it will help save one person."
1,"Frey's fantasy, not reality!","When I was reading the book, I knew it was a lie - it sounded like a man's desires to be what he is really not. If you listened to him, you will know that he is wimpy and a compulsive lier. Actually it was so fake, I read two other books between finishing this one! Anyone could make up bunch of fantasies to help addicts and it is so sad that all he wanted in the end with his publisher was to make millions for themselves and NOT help by any means someone who needed the truth to help him through. If I could return the book, I would because I do not want to contribute to any repulsive lier a penny of my HONEST earned money. Especially now that you all know it's a fake, believe me, it does not impress! Just make up your own lies - it's more fun and cheaper! Definately NOT WORTH THE READ!"
4,"O.K, it's fiction","Though we now know this book is mostly fiction, and should read it as such, it's still a good book. The writer should've stuck with a 'fiction' label, but that's useless hindsight now. Perhaps what needs to be pointed out is that I've read many nonfiction research books that were later found to be 'less than accurate', and that goes for newspapers, magazine articles, etc. Anymore, you have to do your own research and keep in mind that just because it's in writing, that doesn't mean it's true. I've never had such illusions, no matter which memoir or other work of nonfiction I'm reading. However, this is still a great read and I don't regret buying my copy. Oprah has my sympathy, but we can all learn from this and 'move on'.Chrissy K. McVayAuthor of 'Souls of the North Wind'"
3,i knew this was a crock when i read it but....,"although poorly written and full of stretchers, it is a good story. Frey introduces a few interesting characters in this story and you actually like them. Any book, regardless of the contoversy around it, that makes me care about the characters is worth a read."
1,Oh the humanity!,"Frey's affected post stream-of-conscience narration style survives only because the story being told is supposed to be real. Now that we know that almost all of the claims in the book are false, Frey's whole absurd, macho fantasy comes crashing down into a million silly pieces."
1,Faker,"The quality of his writing is only so-so. Now that it has come out that he ""embellished"" (that is completely made up) parts of his life/the story, why read this book?"
1,Fraudulent Silliness.,"When I read this book and having some familiarity with addiction, I was astounded at the untruths and far-out exaggerations contained in this self-professed victim's fairy taleThe outlandish performance at the dentist's,his unlikely physical state on the plane,his tough-guy posture,his being left off the hook for serious infractions. He might be a rich-boy alcoholic but a heroin addict he's not,simply because his behavior does not fit the role.Like others,he has exploited this society's infatuation with drugs to make an easy buck. For an authentic ,yet humble read,throw this junk away and find a copy of Three-Dog Nightmare. Guaranteed,it's the real deal!"
1,A Million Little Pieces,"Frey employs a tedious, simple-formula writing style. The subject matter is compelling. Whether or not ""the emotional truth is there"" as James maintains I'll never know. That statement certainly cannot be trusted. But what we DO know are the simple facts as brought to light recently. Shame on you, little man. Couldn't sell your fiction until you peddled it as non fiction? Reminds me of what happened with ""Mutant Message Down Under.""The truth always wins. Wow, but he made a bundle! I myself am seeking a refund for $16.15, which is what I dropped on the thing at Barnes and Noble in Santa Rosa, CA."
1,A Million Little PIeces,"I found this book to be ridiculous whether it is non-fiction or not. By page 25 I felt it was contrite and unbelievable. This book smells of lies and sensationalism, from smart beautiful women finding him attractive in his disgusting condition, to silly law enforcement stories. The author has made himself out to be some sort of self appointed hero. It is downright disrespectful. As non-fiction the lies are a slap in the face to anyone who understands or knows the devastation of addiction. Not to mention families who have lost children in senseless automobile accidents. For the rest of the reading world, honest authors included, all should be insulted by the obvious lack of background research that shines through. As non-fiction it is deplorable. As a novel it is poorly written. Shame on this author for preying on the less fortunate"
1,Truth is rarer than fiction,"Not only does the author not know the difference, but even some of the reviewers don't realize that a book of lies is FICTION. It is not non-fiction, as at least one reviewer suggests."
2,zzzzz,"A poorly written, mundane account of a rich kid going through rehab. The inconsistantly capitalized Nouns are pretentious and annoying. Frey seems very much in love with himself as super-addict, and is tremendously smug. Unbelievably good luck comes his way thoughout this book, which both made me angry and made me doubt the veracity of his story. Despite what the pub weekly review above says, he's no David Foster Wallace, no Dave Eggers. Hell, he ain't even Dave Thomas, the Wendy's dude."
3,Not Too Believable,"I was pretty dissappointed in this book, the story line was too dragged out to actually keep my interest; also there were parts that just were't too realistic to be a true story. I buy quite a few books that Oprah recommends, but this was truely a dud in my book."
1,Simple horrible,"This book simply put should be titled as non-fiction- it is a disservice to the reader to buy it under memoir, when everyone knows that it's been embellished, altered, fabricated, etc. Furthermore, the writing is horrible!The most important thing that wasn't addressed is the fact that the book has been plagiarized, it is a carbon copy of the author in Los Angeles that died of a drug overdose.One another reviewer mentioned that earlier- I purchased the book and found it to be true. Even the writing style is copied!"
1,Ain't Nothing Like the real Thing!!,"Having read stories of drug addiction..Jesus's Son and Another Day in Paradise. I'm not surprised people would need their drug addiction stories riddled with fabrication's and typical falsehoods about drug addiction spoonfed to them by Oprah's book club so they can feel safe and superior to others in society who don't have trust fund money and parents to bail them out. I would also reccommend The Basketball Diarys by Jim Carroll over the work of this cliche-ridden poser. As One writer already said about James Frey..""He has the smell about him of a future president!"""
1,hello--he lied!,"I don't deny that this is a powerful, resonant life story. It's just not James Frey's life story. If he wanted to create a character who lived this life, he could easily have done so with a novel. There are many wonderful, compelling autobiographical fiction, from PORTNOY'S COMPLAINT to HOW STELLA GOT HER GROOVE BACK.[...]Only he knows why. Personally, I don't think his reasons matter. He could have written this as fiction. But he told his publisher that these things happened to him, and his publisher believed him, and Oprah believed him and his readers believed him. He signed a contract with his publisher which warranted that he was acting in good faith and that he was not misrepresenting the truth (this is standard in all publishing contracts).It turns out he was lying. The book itself is still wonderful. The author, however, is pathetic, and contemptible."
5,Thrust into the Realm of Addiction,"I read a lot, and I'll readily admit it was hard to adapt to this book's stylistic format: a lack of quotation marks for dialogue, the capitilization of certain words for impact, etc. However, after overcoming/adapting to these literary obstacles, this book had me in its grip until the very end. This is one of the most compelling stories I've ever had the pleasure to read. This book is a must-read for anyone recovering from addictions of any sort. There were many stretches that I couldn't put the book down, I had to see what happened next. I only hope they get Gene Hackman to play the role of Leonard should there be a film adaptation."
1,It matters that he's a liar,Let's face it - the book's impact evaporates once it's known it's an invention. Sure James only 5% of the book has been overturned as a fake - but the other 95% can't be examined the same way because it involves your fairytale list of first name only characters who all died.Noone should have to endure this insufferable prose for a lie
1,A Sham,"The essential truth of this book is that it is a lie. If he lied about things that can be verified, then what else? To say it's okay to lie to help people is tantamount to saying the ends justifies the means. Frey and those that support him should be ashamed and if he is the man he claims to be, he should come clean. I will never read anything he writes again."
1,"Mr. Frey needs to understand that ""Non-Fiction"" means ""Real""","It has come to light that portions of this book, labeled as a memoir, are untrue and never happened. The integrity of the author appears to be compromised. Mr. Frey: perhaps you should take some time to familiarize yourself with the definition of what a non-fiction book should be; maybe you should even publish your next work under the ""fiction"" category."
1,I kept hoping the narrator would kill himself....,"...and spare the world the tedious whining he tortures us with in ""A Million Little Pieces."" I was attracted to the book by the cover artwork, which is brilliant. Too bad the story itself isn't half as good. By page fifty, I kept wishing the narrator would meet a painful, bloody end. While there was the potential to make this an insightful and educational story...instead what we get is a pathetic monologue that goes nowhere, and takes a long, long time to get there."
4,Couldn't put it down,"This is a riveting story. I found the memoir to be heartwrenching and inspirational. I don't really care if James Frey exaggerated or changed some of the details. I don't expect a memoir to be 100% accurate, and I would expect any memoir describing addict's personal struggles to have elements changed to protect their identity.I look forward to reading My Friend Leonard, and Mr. Frey's future works.I also applaud his courage for putting up with Oprah's self-serving interrogation"
1,Why do we glamorize this?,"So because he chose not to use his brain or accept personal responsibility for his behavior - it's everyone's fault but his - we offer im glory in this book? We've become a sad society. What is worse is that so many others are following in those same footsteps without accepting their own choices as the cause of their hard life. Boo-hoo....sorry, found it totally unsavory."
2,the book makes Ophrah cry,"I was buying of this book to think it was a real hand on the cover but, I am seeing that Ophrah is crying so much becuase this is not a hand for real on the book. It looks lik it has a hand with a milion little pisces on it (the cover) but, it is not even James Frey's hand! Why is he (James Frye) lying to us?!? with his hands? I feel so deceptered, and weak."
2,I just do not believe it.,"While Frey's details of his actual addiction and the struggle within are believable, the story itself hardly is truthful.The treatment center, the characters, and the outrageous plotlines seem purely fictional. The characters, the ending and other plotlines are done too perfectly, and are written exactly as a fictional piece would be written.Was Frey an addict? - yes, probablyIs this an accurate account of his time at rehab? - most likely notThe writer should have either written the truth of his time in rehab or have the book published as fiction loosely based on his struggle with addiction. To tout this book as an autobiographical memoir, seems just wrong."
2,A Million little Pieces,Nicely crafted. Good read. To bad it tried to claim the status of an accurate autobiography.
3,A Million Little Pieces,"I ordered and started reading the book before the truth was revealed that it has is a combination of truth and fiction. The fact that the author lied about so many of the characters and events has definitely changed my opinion and I have not been able to enjoy the book as much as I could have. I decided to read the book to help my friend who is dealing with a child with drug problems, but feel it would be ridiculous to give it to them now."
5,"AMAZING, AMAZING, AMAZING!!!","I'm been on this earth 64 years & have always been a reader. Now I am a listener to books & I have listened to this book at least 5 times, & have shared it with co-workers and all of us just know this is a powerful, powerful peace from a GREAT author/writer!!!He also wrote: Bright Shinny Morning & the follow up book to A Million Little Pieces: My Best Friend Leonard. Both of them are a GREAT read or listen...highly suggest them!!!"
3,It was OK...but Oprah overdid it,"OK I admit, I bought the book because of Oprah. I hope she doesn't say tomorrow that it is healthy to eat lard from a jar, because before this book, I just may have done it. My wake up call. This book is just ok. Nothing special. As a matter of fact it took me over a month to read it because it was so darn repetitive I couldn't get through it. Yes there are some great parts, and the sequal My Friend Leonard, far surpasses this book, but it is not the ""great"" book Oprah declares. Perhaps she saw some of her own addictions with food in this book and how it overtook her life. I dunno. In any event, it was ok, a bit long and a bit boring. If you get this book, get it to understand the characters for the sequal My Friend Leonard, it is MUCH better."
4,Worth reading,"For all those critics out there, I would ask you to listen for just a moment to my take on this novel. Obviously, Frey's mistake is portraying this as a true memoir while fictionalizing areas but that is not to discount of it in its entirety. I found the novel to be deeply moving and emotional. While there has been so much controversary surrounding this book, I think we should not forget that there are people who found help with their situations through reading this book. I have been effected by many people in my life with similar problems and this helped me understand how strong of an addition alcohol is for millions. If it helps one, then it was worth writing and I for one am glad I read it."
1,Oprah is a hypocrite.,"I'm sorry I didn't say it first since another reviewer beat me to it. But I couldn't agree more. OPRAH IS A HYPOCRITE. Frey and Oprah deserve each other. Why Frey agreed to another interview with Oprah is beyond me. He already made his money selling those lies so what did he have to gain---UNLESS (God I wish Amazon would let me underscore this) UNLESS Oprah PAID FREY to be on the show as PAYBACK just so she could whoop him and save face from the Larry King fallout. Folks, it's all about ratings. Oprah is a business. She's an industry. She can't stand to see her stock fall. And she's no longer credible. She and Frey have that in common. As I say, they deserve each other.I wish I had the option of giving ""pieces"" no stars."
1,It's all fake!!!!,DO NOT READ THIS BOOK!!!! IT IS A WASTE OF TIME SINCE IT IS ALL FAKE!!!! What a jerk to right a book that would give false hopes to any recovering addicts. JAMES FREY IS WORTHLESS!!!!!
3,A poorly written piece of fiction.,"The story was hyped as a true story. From the word go you can tell it's not. I'm sure the only true thing in this book was the author's name. If you have any medical experience, any airline experience, any real life experience, you know that this story is false. Boo on Oprah. She really got it wrong this time."
1,Sham,I work in the criminal justice system and found Mr. Frey's book to be a sham and an embarassment. Many of my clients have truly lived the life he so blatently and deceptively describes as his own and they have not been made rich by publishing a book about it. Shame on him. I returned the book and got a refund.
4,A Million Little Pieces,"By the age of 23 all that James Frey had accomplished in life was being and Alcoholic, a Drug Addict, and a Criminal. In this memoir his love-hate relationship with himself drives him almost to the point of dying. His journey through a Christian based drug rehab center will keep you reading until the end. His compelling tale speaks out against drugs and alcohol to help people everywhere. He learns to laugh, love, and live again. I would reccomend this book to anyone looking for something to keep them reading on."
1,Uniquely Bad,"The book ""A Million Little Pieces"" is definitely unique, but that does not make it a great book; nor even a good read.The irrational use of grammar and punctuation signaled to me on the first page that the author was hiding something and fifty pages in, my suspicious were confirmed.From the characters, not real people that he writes about; to the anger that he has yet to come to grips with; it all seems that he still really misses drinking and doesn't want to admit it.An author can be one-sided as Mr. Frey is; the only thing that I got by trying to read this book is that (as Mr. Frey would say):There is only one Way to live. Everyone else is wrong. They are wrong. I am right. I talked to someone and they told me how to live. I said no that you are wrong.That is totally acceptable, but being angry at not being able to control yourself is something that he has to deal with, not me."
2,Cheaply-Made Product!,"I'm pretty bummed about buying this product, seeing how badly it works, and not being able to return it!!! The arm isn't stable in its' extended position, and almost ends up collapsing completely while it's in use. It feels cheap to the touch, and there is nothing that covers the blade to keep it from getting dull and dinged between uses. I have never had problems with Amazon before, but will make sure I check the return policy before buying something like this again."
2,poor quality - not rechargeable!,"The plastic and construction quality of Mangroomer is poor. The packaging gives the feeling there should be an adapter for recharging the unit under the left side pocket but the system works on two AA batteries (not included).From design stand point, it is a nice concept but if you don't want to use this for shaving back there is no way to detach the extended handle or to open it all the way to be aligned with the body of the groomer.I won't expect the unit to last long. Very disappointed."
4,Gets the job done,"I just used it for the first time today. It tore my back up pretty good because I couldn't get the right angles, but it got the job done. Nothing really special about it, but I'm glad I bought it."
4,Works well.,"Works well, takes some getting used to but beats asking the wife to shave your back for sure."
2,cheaply made,"Well, I paid about $40 for this shaver and it looks, feels, and performs like it should cost about $7.50. I guess it got the job done, but I am not sure how much longer it will continue to work.I probably could have made one out of a standard shaver, a stick, and a rubber band and it would be more durable."
5,Great replacement,"I've had the Philips Norelco Body Groomer for several years, & the rechargeable battery finally died. I must have mentioned that, because I received the Mangroomer for Christmas. Considering some of the reviews here of pulling & red marks, I was a bit apprehensive at first, but took the plunge anyway. To cut to the bottom line- read the directions. If one has a rug on the back, go slow until it's thinned out or try to cut off with scissors as much as possible first. Let the electric razor do the work- don't scrub, as this eliminates the red pressure marks. Make it part of your morning routine before getting in the shower. First you'll wash off the cut hairs, & not letting a rug develop is the key to any back shaver. But what I like this over the Philips unit is: the cutting head doesn't pop off the minute any resistance is felt, the use of AA batteries, the extending handle. It's not as close as a razor, but the Razorba handles that if that's what you want."
2,Didnt last through first use!,"My first impression was how cheap the item felt but I figured at $25 what could you expect? Well, it only made it through 3/4 of my first use before the shaver became dull and began pulling my hair out instead of cutting it. Think twice before buying this junk, you cannot return it."
3,Electric means BATTERY operated,"Worked ok (the product itself does have the ""Made in China"" feel to it, if you have a willing girlfriend/wife, might be easier to buy a cheap ELECTRIC hair trimmer and have her do it."
5,a perfect invention,"I can't believe I went my whole life without this invention. I have moderate back hair, and it's always been impossible to remove it myself. This razor worked perfectly! You do need 2 mirrors, so you can see what you're doing. But in literally 30 seconds, all the hair was gone. It's now 3 days later, and no skin irritation at all. We'll just have to see how long it is before my back needs another trimming.I could not be happier with this, and it's the best $40 bucks I've spent in a long time. 100% satisfied."
1,Back Hair Shaver,"It doesn't work properly, i was very dissapointed at the product, hair gets stuck between the blades and just cuts a little amount of hair. Not useful for my oppinion."
1,It burns!,"To be perfectly frank, this product sucks. It's too powerful. When you turn it on the force alone makes you second guess putting it against your skin. I've given it a few tries now and each time it leaves red marks all over my back and burns for days. Additionally, the angle is actually awkward because you can't keep it in position, so when you hold it up and over your shoulder the latter half (with the blade) swings down against your skin. I just can't figure out why they didn't work a little harder to perfect the product. It's not worth even $1."
1,It barely even trims hair... VERY dissapointed,"I would not recommend buying this item. It does reach spots, but it barely trims hair at all and severely scratches skin. Poor product, very disappointing!"
1,"Flimsy, defective product...no refund...buyer beware!","When the Mangroomer arrived, I immediately noticed the flimsy materials making up the product. I turned the switch to the ""on"" position, and nothing happened. I tried different batteries to no avail. Amazon indicated that I should return the product to the manufacturer. I mailed the product back to the manufacturer and indicated the product was defective and I would like a new Mangroomer. Several e-mails & phone calls later, I have yet to hear from the company. The Mangroomer is a waste of money, and I am highly disappointed that Amazon would sell such a shoddy item!"
4,Buy it!,"The ManGroomer does as advertises. it shaves your back. I will gladly recommend this product to any man with hair on their backs. I previously used a Remington BHT600. It was great also did the job and was waterproof and allowed me to trim other areas, but i had lost my charger while moving and a replacement was just as costly as a new one. So i opted for the mangroomer after reading the reviews. First let me say this gives a much closer shave than the Remington bht600, but its not as easy to use. You have to do long slow strides over the area and can be tricky to maneuver at times and feels awkward in the hands. Once you use it for a couple minutes it gets easier to use. after roughly 15 minutes of tricky mirror angling i was finished. The results were a clean back. Would buy again."
3,Not bad,Rather cheaply made but effective enough. I was able to get it to work but it feels as though it will only last a short amount of time before it breaks.
3,WORKS GREAT BUT I WISH IT WAS BETTER CONSTRUCTED,"I should give this product four stars: it works quickly and efficiently at removing back hair. The item is lightweight and easy to maneuver but keep in mind if you are going to shave your back by yourself you really do need a 3 way mirror to see what you are doing. That said the item I received had a broken part inside the handle which rattled loudly. I had to take the thing apart to see what piece had broken off inside. Luckily the broken piece did not effect the performance of the unit. I couldn't determine what it was anyway. Although lightweight, the ManGroomer is made of VERY cheap plastic: if you drop this thing on a hard surface I'm afraid it would crack or break. For $40, I wish it had been made of sturdier material. Also it does not come with a cap to protect the blade assembly. All-in-all I'm pleased with this product and do recommend it since it is really the only product of its kind I have seen."
5,The only one that works,The only product out there that lets you do it yourself. Takes me about 3 minutes for my entire back - lifesaver. I bought this for twice the price when it first came out 5 or so years ago and it's still going.
1,WORTHLESS,I have a lot of experience with male grooming devices. I am a fairly hairy guy with a mildly hairy back. This thing could not cut one single hair from my back no matter what angle I tried. I am not sasquatch. I returned it and tried a second one just in case it was defective. I could not cut a single square inch on my back. It simply would not cut hair at all. A total piece of junk. Not sure how anyone could possibly have gotten any use of this thing unless I have alien hair. Avoid at all cost and furthermore extremely cheaply made.
2,Good Design - Flimsy Construction,"In fairness, I have to start off by saying that I had this product for over a year and used it successfully 15-20 times. The longer I had it, the more frequently it consumed batteries. After sitting in the drawer for a few weeks, it wouldn't start when I'd turn it on. I regularly cleaned the cutters with a brush and lubed them with Tri-flow, but that didn't seem to help. Sometimes, I could get it going by push-starting the blade with a pencil or something, but mostly it wanted fresh batteries to get going.Finally, even fresh batteries couldn't get it going, so I took it apart to see what I could see. The drive motor has a plastic cam that connects to a plastic arm that moves the blade back and forth. The motor is *tiny*. I'm thinking 3/4"" diameter and 1-1/4"" long. It was fried, so I threw the whole thing away.Would I buy it again? Yes if it was $20. Not at $40! Come on, it is a light-duty, battery powered trimmer on a long plastic handle."
4,groomer,Best product I've found for do-it-yourself back hair removal. Seems fragile - may not survive drop on ceramic tile floor.
2,worked good for about 3 times then stopped working,I had no problems with the unit itself it worked well for alittle bit but didnt seem to have a lot of power. It pulled my hair as it cut and then stopped working i dont think i would buy this product again. It didnt come with any oil for the cutting blade and it takes AA batteries it would have been alot better if it had a built in batterie. Did what it should but was very cheap.
3,Weak,"I don't have a wookie-like hairy back, just kind of patchy back hair. I thought surely this razor would clean up my back pretty well, and I'm sorry to say I have been let down by this product. The power is inconsistent and the razor must not be sharp right out of the packaging, b/c it just didn't work efficiently. The idea is great, and I guess that is what convinced me to buy it."
1,GARBAGE AND PAINFUL,This product is horrible it literally feels like you are scraping your skin off! the shaver head is not angled like a normal shaver so it doesn't cut the hair properly it feels like its ripping hair and cutting you at the same time! And unfortunately I'm not exaggerating. I would rather ask a stranger on the street to help me then use this anymore. And I have tried it 3 times with the same painful result everytime do not buy this it is garbage people.
1,It broke after 3 uses - NOT RECOMMENDED,"The Mangroomer broke after just 3 months. It was used about 3 times.I went to use it one day and when I went to turn it on, it would not work. I replaced the batteries and it still would not work. Apparently a wire or something electronic in the Mangroomer unit had become loose or burned out.I barely even used this item. It was a very big disappointment.[...]The item is very cheaply made. It is made of thin, brittle plastic and is very delicate.When the Mangroomer was working (for the 3 times that I used it), it did do a good job of shaving the hair off of my back.However, just like other reviews have commented, it did irritate and redden my skin."
1,Scratches,Cheap and scratches the hell out of your back if you don't have the angle correct. Don't bother with this one.
3,Mangroomer,Mangroomer gets the job done. Helps you get to those hard to reach places. Although for the money it is cheaply made. Doesn't feel like it will last a long time. I feel like I will have to replace it in the not too distance future. But it's the only thing I have found that really works. So until I find a better made alternative I will use this product.
4,mangroomer,"I liked it, was surprised it didn't cut me, but still sharp enough to do the job. Just positioning the machine was a little uncomfortable."
1,waste of money,"The product is a good idea, just needs to be improved. This particular product is useless. Does not work as intended. Doesnt work at all pretty much. I would like to see this company improve the shaver part by upgrading its cutting ability. I would also like to see a internal battery rather than the throw aways, I wouldnt mind spending extra money for a better product."
1,Worthless,Doesn't work. Doesn't shave. Just pulls hair. I tried it on my arm as a tester and wasn't a fan.
1,Doesn't do the job,Total waste of money. It is not sharp enough to actually shave anything. I had my wife try to shave my back with it thinking I wasn't using enough pressure and still it barely did anything.
4,It actually works!,"I bought this product with some skepticism based on the reviews that it was poorly and cheaply manufactured. Well, that might be as I've had a hard time extending the handle. My only concern is that if I ""gorilla"" with too much torque, I'll break it. So maybe I'm babying it a little but with that being said, it's the only product out there that allows me to keep my back clean. It does the job as advertised without the need to be a contortionist. Takes a little getting use to but I'm pretty satisfied with it."
1,CHEAP!! Does not work very well. DON'T waste your money!,"I thought the mangroomer would be a great thing for my husband's hairy back, however, once he tried it, I changed my mind! It is very light-weight, which is nice, but it does not give a close shave and the other reviewers are correct in saying that you'd need a 3-way mirror to shave it correctly and thoroughly. My husband gave it a try and had trouble with it staying on, almost like it sucked the battery juices right out. Then I gave it a try and thought a disposable razor would be much more efficient. It did not give a close shave and it clogged up quickly! We both agree that $40 is much too high for this product. Don't waste your time people with hairy bodies! Use Nair or a razor - much more efficient! Save the $40 for something more exciting and useful like a waxing!!"
4,Only for a YES fan,"The production is not very good, but, Squire, as always, is fun to watch.If you are a YES fan, you will want this in your collection."
5,The best there is!,"For anyone who grew up in Lancaster,PA there is no doubt about these pretzels. There are a lot of imitators even in the area, but none can match this product that has been available for so many years. Now at 81 years old, I still try to keep a supply on hand. When I could still travel I would pick them up at the bakery. Now they are shipped to my home in Georgia. GOOD!!!"
3,A much darker tale...,"I have enjoyed the handful of Robert Rankin books I've read so far. When I saw this one - with that great title - I immediately bought it. It's not horrible, but the lead character certainly is. I may be going through a stick-in-the-mud phase, but I didn't care for Gary. Beyond him being into serial killing and necrophilia with his voodoo-resurrected wife, he's generally not a likeable guy - a real jerk, in fact.It also took almost half the book to get to the operator portion of the Fandom of the Operator book. When I'm enjoying a book, I'm okay with wandering through backstories and side tracks, but when I'm just trying to knuckle down and get through a book, it seems to drag.If you've read other Robert Rankin books and liked them, then you probably will enjoy this one - at least to some degree. But if you've never read a Robert Rankin book, then skip over to The Hollow Chocolate Bunnies of the Apocalypse for your first sample."
3,"An ending to the trilogy that is, perhaps, too cryptic","Curious - this trilogy (a sequel to the Griffin & Sabine trilogy) was in many ways a more exciting story than the first. And the format and artwork was comparable, but somehow, this final volume in the second trilogy did not seem to have the overall impact. This seems solely due to the amount of information Bantock hints at without ever revealing. If you're used to your novels ending in a nice tidy package, this isn't it. However, the overall storyline, the presentation, and the artwork are enough to encourage me to re-read the first trilogy (which I don't recall as well as I should) and then re-read the second, taking a bit more time and dwelling on the hints and symbols. In doing so, one may get a better idea of what exactly happened."
3,Perplexing,I could not resist getting the 2nd trilogy by Bantock but found it somewhat perplexing and or underwhelming. Maybe a book discussion group would help me understand this 2nd pairing better.
5,If you like Dick Francis...,I found this book and others by this author while searching for horse mysteries. I have read all the Francis books and have always enjoyed them and wished there were more books like them and now there are! An added bonus is that Stacey writes about various equestrian disciplines - this one covers show jumping - and I think would it be enjoyable for people without a horse backround as well as very entertaining for those of us that do know about equestrian pursuits. This book keeps you interested throughout and I was truly thrilled to discover this author's books.
5,Best CD/MP3 Player I've Had,"This player has wonderful quality. It's easy to use, the battery life is great, multi sound features along with easy tracking."
3,Monitor,"Used a Lumiscope monitor made in Germany for over a decade and have had three ""Made in China"" replacements that last a month. I hoped Lumiscope would still be the same as it was, but unfortunately, it's Chinese as well. This is somewhat better than anything else out there, but the Chinese Velcro doesn't hold as well as it should. Time will tell."
5,Flying Nun series,"I realy like this show ""The Flying Nun series"" I'm very fearful to commit myself to these great ""in my mind"" shows. I've bought the 2 seasons of this show and like all other buyers have been left with an incomplete series. I am telling the companies that have brought these shows out to just stop. I've invested money an emotion to be burned when trying to get these complete seasons. So if you start a series please complete them this is why I have stopped buying them until I see all seasons out their. But I will never buy the one given in the part one and two at an inflated price. Not going to happen. Sorry . So please release seson 3 of the ""Flying Nun""as well as other shows that are not completed.Thier are to many to list hear but the companies know which ones I'm talking about as well as us buyers. Thank for your time.Sincerely; Mike"
5,Excellent Supplement,"I have a rescue terrier-mix with a multitude of health issues stemming from a compromised immune system & a level-4 heart murmur (when rescued the heartworms had done a tremendous amt of damage). Missing Link Vegetarian is the only supplement I have found on the market that not only lacks all the food allergy red flags, but offers a full range of enzymes, friendly bacteria, phytonutrients, Omega-3, and so much more. Even when on meds that horrendously upset his tummy, MLV provides not only the nutrients he desperately needs, but also seems to sooth his digestive system -- he would sometimes miss up to 3 meals in a row not able to eat (not good for a 13lb Yorkie-mix), but not with MLV!!! Mixed with coconut oil, he has the best skin and coat this year he's had since his rescue!!!!! Good stuff and we're so thankful!! For more information on this product, go to: [...]"
3,Excellent Belly Dance Cameo by Suzanne Danielle!,"The first time I saw this movie was around 1987 on commercial TV, and what caught my attention was a belly dance cameo by a woman credited as Suzanne Danielle. All the other times I saw this movie on U.S. TV, this cameo had been edited out. However, on British TV in Saudi Arabia in 1995, it had been left intact."
1,Don't waste your time or money,"I bought this item and had it shipped to a friend out of state. It NEVER worked. She replaced the batteries when it arrived, but that didn't help. It was a complete waste of time and money."
5,Great mixing bowls,"I bought these for my daughter for her new home and, quite naturally, had to try them out myself. These bowls are extremely convenient. The pouring spout is very handy and, additionally, you have a non-slip ring on the bottom to keep the bowls steady when you're busy otherwise with the hand mixer. I love all kinds of mixing bowls (not sure why) and these are especially appealing to me."
2,Size,This item is great for small amounts. It needs a bigger size. I was surprised at how small they were.
2,Breaks easily,"I fell in love with these bowls the first time I used them. They were pretty, a nice light weight, comfortable to use and easy to clean. Then I accidentally knocked one to the floor and it shattered--back to stainless steel bowls!!"
5,Great Bowls,"Initially, I thought these bowls were too small. It turns out that they are the perfect size for most of my mixing needs. They are colorful and most definitely sturdy. They are easy to clean and store. Would love another set in different colors."
5,Does the job.,Nice quality for this money. It seems to be quite durable and looks good as well. I would buy it again.
5,Well designed,"The little spout and the handle on the other side are useful, and the rubber ring on the bottom prevents the bowls from slipping. Good quality plastic too."
4,The Secret to Happiness....,"This book was hilarious! I LOVED the end especially, the big lesson learned cracks me up every time I think of it.There were times while reading the book that I wanted to pop Candide. I know this was intentional, but it's hard to stay with a book when you are irritated with the main character. Some of this was hard to pull through, which is why I gave it four starts. It's totally worth it in the end though.I recommend this book to satire fans and philosophy fans and of course literature or humanities students."
4,"A must for any student of the Johnson administration,","Not too dry, starts off with gusto and keeps on going. A great read on Abe Fortas. I love reading about the dynamic between him, Steven Douglas and LBJ. Overall, the book was fascination and very insightfull. Also gives great insight into the ""whiz kid New dealers"",the infighting between the New Deal agencies in the FDR admin. Supreme Court politics and how Supreme Court nominating works."
3,eco dent floss,"it's good because this company doesn't do any animal testing, but the packaging is extremely useless. it's in a cardboard box that is not very logical for something that you are using on a regular daily basis, my husband is already halfway through his floss and the box fell apart a long time ago. i realize that it is probably more economical and environmentally friendly, but if it doesn't do the job then really it's just useless. packaging needs some rethinking."
2,Badly organized and edited,"Here are some examples of the errors in this book; I gave up on it around page 50. It tries to distinguish between RISC and CISC but gets them backwards. Most of the underscores in the code listings have been replaced by spaces. It states that linked lists and arrays are the same thing. A table refers to the ""Bite size"" of processor architectures. Structurally, it jumps quickly into a deep description of x86 instruction scheduling without explaining why. There's some useful information in there, if you can find it through the errors and poor organization. There are better books on the topic."
5,Billy's boot camp Cario BootCamp Live,This is a great workout with great results. Be warned if you are a beginner that it is tough. It is only really 25 minutes of workout and 5 minutes of warmup/cool down. If you want to be challanged this is it. Billy does use bands in this one. Beginners need to work up to it. I have all the tapes and work out with them all the time. This one is great if I do not have a lot of time.
4,Nice & Sharp,These add texture to my shag haircut nicely between trips to the hairdresser. My son also wears his hair long and shaggy and he has very thick hair so these are great to thin his hair out some. Sharp and cuts our hair well.
1,Junk. Total junk.,"The gyroscope looked pretty good on the website, but I probably should have looked at the price and reviews a little more closely. When I was a kid, I had one that was great. I wanted to show my son a simple physics toy that I liked and used.This one, the frame wasn't closed together and welded, so any pressure while winding it up caused the center spinning portion to come loose and fall out. The size was smaller than I expected from the pictures, but that was probably my own oversight.We got to use it a total of 5 or 6 times before it was rendered useless.(Also, had to adjust the seating of the pins at first in order to allow it to spin more than 8 seconds.)Even for the price, stay away. It's not worth it."
4,Gospel Mixx,This is a terrific product. You will certainly be blessed by purchasing this product.Carol L. Staley-Abney
3,eeuch...,"This is one of those truly horrifying books that I amazed myself by reading. It deals with the many problems in today's society including drugs, racism and poverty. It is mainly the story of a racist young boy who spends time with a prostitute/drug addict and her boyfriend (also a drug addict) who murdered both his parents. I consider reading to be a hobby of mine. However, I derived no enjoyment from this book, granted it is well written and contains many important messages but it was also harsh and a depressing read. However, the ending was most satifying as it restores hope in people after an entire book about their grievous faults. The story is compelling and made me feel grateful for what I have.It is interesting and educational yet heartbreaking."
2,"Not nearly as good as ""The History Mix-Volume 1""","I was really excited to see a new release of Godley & Creme but was disappointed with this album. Some cuts are the same as The History Mix, but without the extended composition. For instance, Cry is missing the entire introduction! This album has a lot of songs which are good, but missing the aura that made the History Mix great."
2,Not what I was looking for,"I was looking for a CD that would have some common chants and prayers that would be more appropriate to meditation. This CD is trying to bring together a series of spiritualities and traditions, and the singers and musicians sound more amateurish than what one would hope. I recognize that they are amateurs, but there are tracks in which the singers are not even in tune.Overall, I don't know if I will really listen to this again. I would prefer something that is more restful and contemplative. While the musicians sound like they are having fun, the result is a bit too rowdy and unconnected to use for meditation."
3,It's.....different.,"That was my first thought as i listened to ""Creature"", the album's opening track. Then i heard ""shameful"" and was completly blown away. But somehow i can't find myself listening to the whole thing and every time i put it in i only listen to Shameful and Ex's and Oh's. ""We Stand Up"" is another great track and it's really heavy. ""The Theft"" is the most diverse song Atreyu has ever done. It's really slow like a ballad and it doesn't sound like them that much.In the end,I'd recommend The Curse before this album."
2,One Word: DOWNLOAD,"I was very dissapointed with this album. Although there are some tracks that are 'single material' if you know what I mean, Atreyu just completely lost it. I was just in my room listening to Bleeding Mascara (its not on this album) and then thought to myself 'hey, atreyu has a new album out' so I downloaded it for a fraction of the price then in a cd store, but I just thought 'wow, this album just isnt atreyu!!'. I don't like this album very much. don't waste your money buying this just burn a copy of it from a friend or something because this is DEFINATELY not worth the full price money."
1,Crap On A Stick!,"Atreyu Says:""Hey look at me I am sooo metal dude! Hey dude! Check out my finger tapping! No way braw! Metal dude! Yeah tattoos and two bass drums! That is sooo metal! Eyeliner makes me more Metal! Our drummer sounds like Phil Collins man! Yeah dude! Right on!""METAL? WRONG!More like crap on a stick."
1,Character assasination posing as biography,"Having much respected O'Brien's writings on Irish history, I was thoroughly looking forward to his take on Thomas Jefferson. Was Jefferson a secret supporter of the Great Terror of the French revolution? Sadly, this is not a biography so much as it is a hatchet job. Jefferson was no saint. So what? Saints don't make for interesting lives anyway. But most of O'Brien's attacks are not substantiated; they're of the ""this is the opinion I formed the other day while shaving"" variety. This unremitting character assassination -- screed may be a better word -- is not worth the paper it is printed on."
5,You will be happy you bought this!!!,This product is excellent protection for my laptop. It allows me to keep my laptop save and snug in my puma bag. No worries!
4,"Good protection, too bulky for me","I loved the Sumo case I had for my old mbp, so I tried this one for my new, smaller one. I think it would do the job (protection) well, it's just too bulky for what I'm looking for. I got a smaller computer to be easier to carry to class, etc. and a thicker case doesn't help that endeavor. If you don't mind size - go for it."
3,Cheap Functional Bag - Too Bulky,"It's a functional bag, my Dell D400 fits very nicely. Unfortunately the bag is rather bulky and could have been designed better, like a more fitting sleeve that doesn't take up as much room in a backpack. Then again, for 10 dollars, I cannot complain too much. 3/5 stars"
4,cool product,"I ordered the wild hibiscus flowers in syrup to give to a friend as an engagement present. The shipping was so much that I figured if I wanted to try them too, I aught to get one for me as well. They came well packaged and in a very timely manner. I tried them and they were good tasting and had a good texture. It didn't seem like the flower bloomed very much in the champagne, however. But it still looked beautiful in the flute and was fun to look at. I would recommend these as well as probably purchase them again at some point, I just wish the shipping didn't cost more than the item itself."
5,Australian nostalgia trip,Bought this for my husband who was an Australian in London at the same time as Bazza. He loved the gift. Though I'm not a fan of Dame Edna-I loved the one-eyed trouser snake song sung by Barry!
4,Monitoring my BP in San Jose CA,"It's a pretty good deal for the price. I have a hard time hearing my heartbeat ""thump"" thru the stethoscope so I had a friend try it. She said the sound was a bit faint but she was able to take the reading on the first try. That's the only drawback to this product that I can see. I'm sure that with more practice I will be able to do it myself so I am going to keep trying. It's simple to use and one person (yourself) can do it.I think it's a great way monitor your blood pressure and to watch for significant changes so you can alert your doctor before it's too late."
3,Manual BP Monitor,"Obsolete these days. Most hospitals use digital. Still, it is a great skill to have."
3,A Refreshing Change,"I thought that this book was all right, but not my favorite of Alexander's. Still, I thought it was a nice change from his other books, which altough are all wonderful seem to have the same characters:1) The main protonagist, usually male (Taran, Tamar, Prince Jen, Theo, etc.)2) The protonagist's love (Eilonwy,Voyaging Moon, Mickle, Joy-in-the-Dance, etc.)3) A sort of witty friend (Fflewder Fflam, Baksheesh, Rajiswami, etc.)4) A wise friend (Ashwara, Salamon, Master Hu/Fu/Wu/Whatever, Gwydion, etc.)5) Usually some other friends of the main protonagistI know that they are all different, and all are some of my favorite books, but this was still a bit of a nice change for me, if not for anyone else. I didn't really like it more than any other of Lloyd Alexander's works, probably a little less actually. I would recomend this to any Lloyd Alexander fan who is looking for something different."
4,"Good CD, but Re-records","This is a good CD, but if you're looking for the real ""hits"", skip this one. SOme of the songs sound downright lazy, like this slowed down re-record of ""The Race Is On"", as well as this version of ""She Thinks I Still Care"".The high points of this collection are as follows:First, this CD contains the best version (and there have been a few) that Jones ever recroded of ""White Lightnin'."" This version far surpasses the original Murcury recording and the Musicor version where they tried to get by using twin fiddles (very cheezy).The second high point is the very ""true-to-the-original"" re-record of ""She's Mine.""All in all, this is a good CD (Jones couldn't record anything that wasn't), but keep in mind that these are NOT the original hits, and they will sound just like what they are: Re-records."
2,undeserving,"I have looked for JW footage for as long as I can remember and at last something comes out. This fantastic artist deserves a lot better than this shody quality DVD. The performance he does with his brother begs for better sound and picture, are we in 2003? Is Sony or Alligator out there somewhere? I shot some footage of his performance in Tampa in early 90's but the Gestapo quickly grabbed me by the neck and confiscated it, thanks Slatus! Johnny is one of the best of all time and yet none of his labels put anything out for us to enjoy. I guess you have to be an entertainer to have your work preserved and distributed by record companies, artists need not apply."
2,OVER ALL POOR QUALITY,"It was great just to have something of Johnny's on DVD, but it just seems like it was thrown together. Poor sound for sure, picture is so so, but overall a must have for die hard fans like myself. I have enjoyed Johnny since the early 70s, I hope for more from him in the near future. So buyer beware this is what it says, pieces & bits."
5,Better than expected,"How the RoadPro will hold up over the long run is yet to be seen. In the first two months the briefcase has preformed far beyond expectations. Its ability to expand to accommodate large or bulky items or collapse when needed makes it a good choice when you need to stay organized, but have limited space such as the cab of a truck."
4,Good value,"I bought this case to carry all my music books as well as tuners, metronome, recorder, etc. I liked that it had so many pockets. For the price it does everything I need. It is not made extremely well but for the price it is a really good value that would be hard to beat."
2,"Zipper really ""stuck"" feeling, front pockets weird","I really wanted to like it. But after using it for 3 months (it did not break), I switched to a Samsonite 3 Pocket (x 2 the price).The size is okay, but sliding things in and out does not seem very smooth. The worst part is the zipper. I suppose I should oil them ... but then, yuck, you'll get oil on your paper, laptop, etc. It feels like it's going to be stuck somewhere any minute. That's true for the middle zippers, the front pocket zippers. Just does not feel good at all. Even after a few months, it does not loosen up.The 4 front pockets are strange. Two of them are connected ... so it's kinda like a fake pocket. Couldn't figure out any use for them. The carry belt that came with it is thin and not very useful. Replaced it with a more cushioning used belt."
4,Great paper for the struggling writer,I use this paper in my first grade classroom for students who struggle with seeing the lines and thus struggle with handwriting. This way they can feel the lines and it really helps them to improve their handwriting.
1,DOESN'T WORK,We tried testing 4 different people several times with this blood pressure monitor and everyone the reading wasn't accurate. All the readings were so low that you would be dead if they were accurate. Do not buy this item.
5,Great!,"It is a wonderful product! It is a comforting scent that you can use any season. It does not start with the big bang, but you will periodically smell the scent through out the day when you least expect it to surprise you.It is refreshing and comforting at the same time. Do try it!"
3,My favorite monkees episode,This tape has my favorite Monkees episode of all time: the fairy tale. Whenever I want to laugh I always think of Mike's magic locket and his princess costume. Most enjoyable for 60's television.
3,A bit disappointed,"I was a bit disappointed with this product. The colors were much lighter than I expected. Plus when I opened the box, a foul odor blew out. I was thinking about returning it but I totally messed up the box and the case that was holding it. That'll teach me to be careful."
2,ipod falls out of skin,These skins don't hold the Ipod safely when using the necklace attachment. The Ipod falls right out of the bottom.
1,Terrible,"These wipers are very streaky. I have had these wipers for two days, and they have gotten progressively more streaky. When I first put them on, and tried them out in the rain (Seattle, WA), they worked good for the first 15 minutes. After that, the first streak appeared. Later, the next day, I have several streaks. I checked the wiper to see if some debris was causing the streaks, only to have my fingers come away from the wipers all covered in black. Ergo, as well as being streaky, they are disintegrating."
4,Very cute,I bought this for my niece who was born in late November and her crib is an off white. It is so worth the money and looks really cute tied on to her crib.
1,Broke before first use. Junk.,"(Teal) I stacked this item with diapers for the first time and the tie broke from the weight. Very cheaply made and would not recommend to anyone. Pay a little more and get a little more. However, Amazon was extremely awesome when I wanted to return and credited me right away."
3,Personalized,"This diaper stacker was exactly what I was looking for. It matches my baby boys room. We did his room in ""Carters All About A Bear"" theme. I was watching the mail every day until it arrived. Today I recieved it and its not exactly what I ordered. The name was threaded in almost the same shade as the diaper stacker itself. I can not even see it if I am a couple steps away. The picture on the computer shows it to be alot darker and its not. I paid for the personalization and I am not so happy. This was a let down. I wish they would have made it so you can see it if I'm a few steps away."
3,Not the Celtic-Rock Tempest,"This album is NOT by the Leif Sorbye Tempest, but a metal band from Canada."
1,Grade School Spelling,If a grade school error in spelling the President of the United States name properly is present in this film then there is more than fear based rhetoric to be concerned about. Such an error is certainly a litmus test for the thought processes that created this film.If we are to fear anything it should be ourselves. Not only for our sake but for others as well.
4,even better,i like this book even better than the frist one.joey is just such a lovable chacter. you really felt for him while he was trying to connect with his dad. i hope thete are more joey books to come.
3,"Stereotyping an ""ADHD kid""","After hearing all the hype about this new book by Jack Gantos, I was disappointed with it. Yes, it is shown through the eyes of Joey who is constantly worried about being ""wired."" But the dark undertones concerning his family seemed to blur this image, aiming the spotlight at his disfunctional family. The idea of an alcoholic father who is at times abusive and feels that Joey must become superior to his ailment in order to be a man is disturbing for me. Add on the emotionally-damaged, cancer-ravaged grandmother along with the minimum wage single mom, and you get a book of cliches. It is exactly this profile that most special education students who suffer from ADHD are trying to negate. It is not for young children; instead, it is meant for adolescents who can reflect thoughtfully on Joey's circumstances and can understand the truth in this stereotypical work."
2,Hurts your ears,"Spring is too strong, so that it hurts your ears. I could only use this stethoscope for a very short period of time."
2,Case does not latch closed with palm inside,"The belt clip is well designed, however the aluminum case is not.2 problems:1) the case does not stay latched with the palm inside -- probably because the hinges are a couple of milimeters too low, so like a briefcase that's stuffed too full, it does not stay closed.2) The mechanism for holding the palm in the case is not as solid as it could be. 2 plastic clips slide into the notches on the back of the palm. I would be worried about the palm falling out of the case while attached to a belt clip (especially since the case does not close)In defense of the manufacturer, I did not contact them about returning the product, I'm sure they would have replaced it. Instead, I cannibalized the belt clip and fixed it to a different aluminum case that I already owned."
3,Early Puccini,"The panegyrics of the reviewers surprises me. This is a pleasant opera but hardly exceptional. I could not make out the words of the women. Killebrew is incomrehensible, which makes it hard to evaluate her. Scotto is better but still lacks exemplary enunciation. Nor did I find the singers expecially strong. Scotto does not have a large role, and she did not overwhelm me. Bergonzi has a good voice on the recording, but his sibilation and mannerisms detract from his performance. Sardinero is not an exceptional baritone, though he has a pleasing voice.The plot is silly and the libretto is weak. Edgar preceded the four famous operas which were followed by the mediocre Fanciulla del West, while La Rondine came after them, but I put them in the same class for quality and musical effect."
5,The great Duplex Planet illustrated,"I feel that Duplex planet is is in the same vain as Arthur Bradford's How's Your News. Elderly people, much like handicapped people, are often times vibrant,colorful, funny and moving parts of our culture. Greenberger, like Bradford, lets us hear thier voices. The zine, Duplex Planet, has always been something that I felt is beautiful and necessary. The special illustrated versions somehow added to the dimensions of the yarns by the inhabitants of the Duplex. No More Shaves is a wonderful collection brought to us by the wonderful publishers, Fantagraphics, that collects some of the greats in the world of alternative illustration. Highly recommended by the OilCan!"
3,"Nice for begginners, although basic and outdated","I have liked this book, although has some strengths and some weaknesses.The strong points are that it is very practical indeed, it talks about the typical points to consider while deploying automated activities such as building, configuration management, testing, etc. Some 4-5 popular tools are reviewed for each discipline and explained. To sum up, it gives you a quick summary on tooling and process trends in the industry.The two main weak points are that the book is clearly outdated, since tools have evolved quite a lot since 2005. This is clearly a challenge for any book talking about tools. The other is point is that the book is a too basic if you have worked developing in a minimally good team since many of the tools or practices may have been already deployed.Overally, the book is worth reading if you are not very experienced. Else, you may not get a good value from it.Alex Ballarin @ Cynertia Consulting. Barcelona. Spain."
2,"Good, but....","I love the Kim Possible series and enjoyed watching it on the Disney Channel before they replaced it with sophomoric sitcoms. And it's nice to at least have a few episodes from the first two seasons available to watch. However, I don't understand why they don't release seasons 1 and 2 as complete sets in the US. How are you going to release the first two seasons in countries other than the one it was created in? What's wrong with them? Disney, get with it and start making decisions that make sense."
4,A Fond and Fun Look Back at the Dawn of the Jet Age,"Skyliners 3 takes us beyond its preceding volume, which featured airliners of the late 1950s and early 1960s throughout Europe and South America. The Jet Age reached Asia as well, with several national airlines placing orders for the Douglas DC-8, Boeing 707, and Convair 880. Hamlin and Lawrence take the reader on an enjoyable voyage across the Pacific, to such far-reaching locales as Hong Kong (old Kai Tak) and Tokyo. Each stop offers an amazing variety of late piston and turboprop and early jet passenger aircraft. Several rare piston-engine airliners are featured as well.The photos are generally of good quality and well reproduced. The short captions are entertaining, even if they do not have a great deal of substance. What makes this book worth the money is that it offers a seldom seen glimpse to the late 1950s and early 1960s, one rarely seen in such a high-quality format."
4,A Blast From the Past,"I bought this CD for the Popcorn song and I'm really glad I did. What a silly CD. Now, not all the songs on this CD are as great as the Popcorn song, but I knew that going into it from the music samples provided by Amazon. Still, I've gotten a real kick out of this CD on the whole. I have shared it with my 8 year old who now likes it as much as I did when I was growing up."
5,Everything I need,The Casio DBC610a-1a works great. It has all the features I need handy on my wrist and I do not have to revert to pulling out a call phone to use a calculator!
4,"Excellent, but...","After way too many years of yanking up my toolbelt way too often, I finally purchased suspenders for them. The suspenders work great, but are on the short side. I'm 5'11"" and have the straps maxed out and the suspenders bring the tool belt above my waist - higher than where I usually wear pants/belts, etc. A little uncomfortable at first, but once I realized I made it through a whole day without once hitching up my belt, I knew I would get used to them.The gel pads are comfortable, albeit a little warm. But let's face it, anyone who actually works outside is no stranger to being warm/sweaty/ uncomfortable/overall miserable in the middle of summer.The cell phone pocket - because the suspenders are high - actually ends up very close to the top of my shoulder. Again, it's just a matter of getting used to and as an added bonus the cell phone is closer to my ear and I don't have to fish around for it in my pocket. Ditto for the pencil holders on the opposite strap."

4,brown bag harness,"decent product, fast delivery, well made. Having a few issues with the clips popping off generally when I stretch and I have a paslode gun hanging off my tool belt. To be expected though when used with a tool belt that wasn't designed for use with a harness. Wish the phone holder was smart phone size however. I haven't had a phone that small for years. Might just use it to hold some starbursts or something. ;)."
2,Why go external?,"I don't see any reason to use external CD burners as apposed to internals. A few things to consider:1. Externals cost significantly more than internals.2. Externals are most often larger and heavier than internal (with a few exceptions) making them actually less portable.3. With externals, you need to carry wires around. Internals use standardized wires. Every computer has an IDE cable and a power cable from the power supply. Try asking your friends if they have a spare FireWire cable and AC adapter with the right voltage to hook up your CD-Burner with.4. Externals often require drive-specific windows drivers. With internals, windows uses it's standard IDE CD-ROM drives and recognizes the drive on boot-up. all you need to install is CD-Burning software."
3,"""Standard"" Piers action [no spoilers]","The fast paced yet frantically composed novel ""Race Against Time"" follows a Caucasian male within an enclave of humanoids similar in culture. After uncovering a profound racial difference pertaining to he and his parents, he begins questioning his origins. The ingenious narrative resembles an extended short story, little character and environmental development with instant and sometimes impractical answers to encountered problems by those obviously unskilled in such unusual technologies.Ultimately the premise raises interesting issues concerning the direction and leaving questions whether as a society the human species are heading towards the ""Standard"" outcome. The tale may be exceedingly controversial and rather provocative as a debatable subject by anthropologists or those in the development of humankind.Thank you."
1,Very Disappointed,I bought this for my young daughter's birthday. She wants to be a doctor when she grows up but this is barely worth being a toy. One can barely hear the heart beat (if at all) much to my chagrin. I hope nurses out there don't buy this because they will be disappointed and put the patients they care for in jepordy.
5,"From beginning to end, a perfect album","You can definitely hear the band taking a new direction with this album. As a fan of Superchunk from their very first self titled album, Foolish is my favorite. Perhaps I changed along with them. After the first few listens, I found myself intrigued by the slower songs on the album. Each member of Superchunk (Mac, Laura, Jon and Jim) are extremely talented. I have fun trying to make out Mac's lyrics, which, all Superchunk fans will tell you, can sometimes be difficult. My favorite song is ""Kicked In"". Superchunk are one of my all time favorite bands, and each of their albums are a must have. All that, and they still put on an amazing live show! They make fun of eachother, tell jokes, and do great covers. Listen to Superchunk!"
5,British humour at its best!,"Being a fan of 'Allo 'Allo, I was thrilled to find out that series 5 was finally being released. Believe me, it was worth the wait. Lots of smutty jokes and double meaning puns ...of course Rene talks his way out of tricky situations every time. Officer Crabtree still keeps me in stitches with his attempts at French, and Herr Flick and Helga add a little spice. I recommend this series of 'Allo 'Allo and hope that series 6 will not be too far away.Frances in Australia"
4,BUY THE OTHERS BEFORE,"Well, for someone who doesn't know how is Curve sound, maybe this is not the best to buy. This compilation doesn't give you a complete idea of Curve deph and power. I suggest to buy the others album before, from the first 1991's PUBIC FRUIT to the last 2004's THE NEW ADVENTURES OF CURVE, following their path through sound. If you will like them, maybe you will love them, otherwise, try again to listen and understand a unique band."
2,Reading/Writing connection,"Very, big very long book.Wasn;t very appealing to me. Alot of information to absorb.barely read any of it because it was hard to read."
1,smells really bad!!!,"I think this is a matter of taste, but anyways, I HATED the smell of it!! It just stinks!! =/"
1,Life Is Bad Enough!,"Got through 3 chapters and deliberately left it at the laundromat. This kind of story (true or fiction)throws our already murky opinion of ""fellow man"" right into the muck. Choosing NOT to read about or being aware of unpleasantness does not make it ""go away"", but an uplifting book or story also uplifts one's outlook. Suing, strugling and going through legal battles did not make this woman's life any better, and this kind of writing does NOTHING for the world."
5,The Truth WILL Set You Free: USA,"What a Story, this little child carried the whole world so to speak on her tiny shoulders for so many years, she let her own life be taken away so her family could have comfort and money, yet she suffered day after day for over 25 years, I just can't imagine that this could be done by a mother who carried this child for 9 months and then sold her to this sick twisted man to do as he wanted to her. I am so glad the courts awarded her the money and freedom from him, it wasn't enought, it will never heal the hurt and pain she suffered and is suffering today, I hope that our judges and lawyers see to it that no one goes free who does this to another person, a child especially, they are so precious and innocent. Mothers don't let a man harm your children money isn't worth it. I hope everyone reads this book, It will help to stop the abuse that goes on in our country. o"
1,better off buying at book store,"Recieved my book yesyerday, I haven't been able to put it down although I bought it because it said it was brand new I was better off buying at Barnes and knobles. Its rough around the edges and stinks like it was in a mildew garage or basement. Not cool!"
5,Magnificent Giulini and CSO,"I had several of these recordings on LP and jumped to buy this CD set when it came out. The CSO was at the time of these recordings, as ever, a magnificent orchestra, with the likes of Ray Still and Adolph Herseth in the primes. And while Giulini became well known for Mahler and Bruckner, not to mention Beethoven and Brahms, it's the Berlioz R&J that really stands out to me. This was a great conductor/orchestra relationship, and these recordings are to be treasured. I could only wish the classical record industry was still robust enough that DG would issue a similar set of their recordings from this partnership: Schubert C Major; Mahler 9, etc.."
1,Electronic pill timer,"I have tried numerous times and can't program the timer for the correct time. I progam it according to the instructions step by step and it will still alarm 2 hours before my set time. It will also alarm on ""mute""."
4,"Oh, those tender heartfelt indie rockers.","This is an incredibly sweet album, chock full of poppy nuggets from Matt and Debby. It's really impossible not to be won over by this disc - it's just too much fun. Then again, there could be a reason why it's 141,659th on Amazon's sales list. I've never claimed to be in line with the average consumer."
4,Mantiene buenos niveles de Colesterol,"Tengo 5 años tomando Policosanol y mi colesterol marcha bien. El precio de Swason es bueno, cumple mis expectativas en todo sentido."
2,A chore to read,"Although I enjoyed the Santa Fe setting, I found this book too too complex to enjoy. I don't mean intellectually complex, but rather there were a few plots going on at once, plus so many characters I couldn't remember who was who and after a while didn't even care. It was like the author just kept on making up more and more people that were possible suspects or in some way involved in the murders. I don't recommend this book."
5,The Perfect Dice Cup,"Dice cup was everything I hoped for. Dice themselves that came with are kinda cheap and not so nice, but well worth it overall."
4,Not grav lox,Thought this was grav lox but its really just smoked fish. Tastes awesome but just not what I was expecting.
3,Too picky,"While the thing works, it's very particular about placement of the cuff--get it too high or too low or turn it a little too far in either direction and it doesn't get a reading. This morning I had to adjust the cuff position 3 times before it finally gave me a reading--by that time any reading it gave on that arm would be questionable anyway--it's more hassle than a device using a manual stethoscope would be. I'm looking for a replacement that works better.OTOH, its durable--I've had it for three years now and it still works as well (or poorly) as it ever did."
3,Hmmm,"This was my first Catherine Hart, and it was really more funny than romantic. Sammie's accent also was so annoying. I wish it could have been 100 percent changed after her lessons. Also, I know that this book was written in 1990, but some of the stuff that was supposed to be funny was just corny. Travis was also a bit rude. I would have punched him for some of the things he said to Sam, like saying she'll get fat if she ate a slice of pie when she was pregnant. He treated her like a child sometimes, no wonder she was so mad. But I will try another book by Hart."
1,This is one stupid figure,I have not bought this figure but by looking at it this does not look like a good figure to me the figure of Jill does not even look close like being Jill do not waste money on this figure. thats what i think.
4,Essential French Literature,"Any lover of the French must read the coming of age tale of Celine. Written in 1954, Bounjour Tristesse was novel and took on issues of young love and jealously that seemed ahead of it's time. Now, the book may feel a bit passe, but for understanding the author and time it was written-- it remains a classic."
3,A huge step forward,"Just like many of you I am a fan of the first three records and above all AJ's raspy voice.But that voice will NEVER come back, so we may as well stop complain about it and focus on the songs and try and get used to AJ's wider vocal spectrum.On CANTOS, we get lots of piano and classic guitar back, and that is already an improvement over the past two records. Next, the songs are better imo, allthough I do not like that 'Beatles' sound that still pops up now and then .... miss the bluesy/jazzy influences. Because of his great piano playing, every now and then that NO Funk is back in, ie another positive point.I wouldn't put CANTOS up there with 'Me In The Bar' or 'Fit To Serve', but maybe that is because also I still miss that raspy voice.The songs are there, the piano is there and so are the guitars .... so let's get used to the 'new' voice.To me CANTOS is GOOD, and that's why it get's the 3 stars.Mind that 'good' is still lots better than most releases I have heard this year."
1,It ate my hair!,"In two seconds, this brush tangled into my hair so badly I couldn't get it out. It took my husband at least 15 minutes to detach it from my head. I think it was because of the ball-tipped bristles, which are stiff plastic with a little ball on the end of each one. They're not like regular hairbrush bristles. My old hot air brush had bristles like a hairbrush, and it never tangled my hair. (Unfortunately, it conked out after a few years.)Sorry, I would not recommend this brush!"
4,Great knife sharpener,"This is a great knife shapener. I've been using these since I was very young. The only reason I didn't give it a full five stars is because it says it is Fine, but it's a little more course than I was expecting or wanted. It may be just that I need to break it in, but I did want it a little more fine than it is. Still an amazing knife sharpener tho."
1,Junk,"Don't waste your money. When it's not giving a ""snr"" error, it's always counting down and then when it gets tired, it starts counting down again! Did I mention that it counts down and then restarts! What a terrific count down timer!!I figured it out. It keeps counting down, until your blood alcohol level get below .08! What a terrific gimick!"
1,doesn't work 99% of the time,"Keeps ""rebooting"" several times (and several minutes) only to state ""Snsr"" error. Even sent it back to the manufacturer (beyond the warranty) period. They charged something around $30 to re-calibrate only to have it returned to me exactly the same way."
3,Not so good,"Most of the songs in this book are really simple. I was expecting something more complicated (it doesn't have to be hard to play...take Classical Gas for example... it's an easy piece but it sounds complex). Next time put some samples of the songs in the book online, or an ""intermediate"" or ""beginner"" indicator."
5,Odor Killer Spray,This stuff works great. I also love the fact that its so easy to use. I bought this for my parents that have two pomaranians and woow does it make a difference. Before when I walked into their courtyard on their condo all I could notice was dog waste odor. This stuff works instantly.
2,Don't like em,"I bought these so I could make my own baby shower invitations. I don't care for them. I don't know if you need some special ink, but I have an ink pad and the markers that you can use on stamps and neither work well with it. It kinda bubbles up so the entire stamp doesn't appear on the paper. Money down the drain."
3,"Good product, not fast service.","I ordered this as a Christmas gift early (just incase). And I was glad I did. Amazon had to contact the seller and remind them to ship the product. Took them 3 weeks to ship my product. I was pleased with the product (the set was complete, nothing was damaged)--it was just stressful having to wait that long (almost 1 month)."
3,Good effort,"This book is simply that, a book about new American town house. It started with a description of the evolution of town house, rite from the time of Palladio & Vitruvius to the present time. The rest is 20 examples of American townhouses all seemed to be going skyward fulfilling all kinds of tastes ranging from chic, loft style, minimalistic, opulence, romantic. & so forth. There are tonnes of pictures in this book with helpful building plans. I always like variety & after browsing thru initial examples, the rest of the book I really couldn't bother with as they all look pretty much similar. Afterall, a townhouse is a townhouse. Anyhow, this book is beautifully presented & definitely worth keeping if you simply want a coffee book for show. Keep up the good work."
5,Love it.,"I can't get enough of this dvd.The show is worth watching over and over.This is one of the best shows on Sho,beside Dead like me."
5,HUFF,"IF THIS SHOW WAS ON ANY OTHER CHANNEL IT WOULD BE ONE OF THE HIGHEST RATED SHOWS ON TV. THE PERFORMANCES OF HANK AZARIA AND OLIVER PLATT ARE OUTSTANDING. NOW THAT THE COLTS LOST IN THE PLAYOFFS, I HAVE SOMETHING ELSE TO LOOK FORWARD TO. LOOKING FORWARD FOR SEASON 2."
2,Don't believe all the hype,"Blythe Danner and Oliver Platt are the only reasons to watch this show - their characters and performances are terrific! But Hank Azaria, as Huff, was the most unlikeable, whiny, self-involved main character I have seen in a long time - and not convincing as a compassionate person or as a psychiatrist at all. So if you've been feeling like you should give this show a try because of all the hype, and because you enjoy and seek out quality television - you really needn't bother. Watch Deadwood instead."
2,Cage and Kidman??? What's up??,The story line? So so. The acting?? What? So very predictable. The ending? No way!! I was hoping for at least a good ending??!! But....Cage and Kidman didn't fit together. Total waste of time and money. :/
1,Trespass,"Those who are intent on scrutinizing Nicolas Cage's career as he takes role after role in films of ALL sorts may want to give this one a look, if only for a few more of his trademark freakout moments. Helmed by Joel Schumacher and co-starring Nicole Kidman, Trespass follows a wealthy young family who are taken hostage in their mansion by extortionists looking to score on a home invasion run. Unfortunately, the film simply relies on too many familiar elements from other similar films like Panic Room, rendering the tension ineffective, and is far too nasty and aggressive to be entertaining. It's not much of a surprise that the film opened almost exactly two weeks ago and is now already finding its way to home video."
3,The world's dumbest criminals caught on film!,"The first half of the movie runs tight and suspenseful. But the trick with these kinds of movies is that once the hostages escape, the movie is pretty much over. This leads to some pretty lame developments which I won't reveal. But here's a hint: You know those horror movies where the victim escapes the attacker and runs upstairs instead of downstairs? It's kind of like that. It's like an episode of The World's Dumbest Criminals or The World's Dumbest Hostages. The ending somehow doesn't feel satisfying, because everything that comes before it just gets lamer and lamer. It is well-filmed and directed, though. I give three stars for Nicolas Cage and Nicole Kidman, and the daughter who looks like a young Sasha Grey. And I will continue to support these first releases on streaming video, mainly because I'm too lazy to get dressed and drive to a sticky movie theater with people chomping on popcorn and slurping up soft drinks out of livestock buckets."
2,"Disappointing, to say the least","Nicolas Cage is a rich guy pretending to be poor pretending to be rich. Almost gets away with deceiving a group of inept robbers that he's broke, until one of them crashes into a dry wall filled with millions of dollars. Burns the money to burn everyone else away.Awful movie. Wanted to punch Cage's character in the face the entire time."
2,good for nichole,"TYPICAL FOR CAGE, NONSENSICAL VIOLENCE,AND GUTTER TALK,DO PEOPLE REALLY CARRY ON LIKE THIS?SAME OLD HOME INVASION ""HOSTAGE.PANIC ROOM.AND ONE STARRING HARRISON FORD?IF IT WASNT FOR NICHOLEYOU WOULDNT WATCH,HOW DID HE GET A OSCAR?THIS TYPE OF THING IS GETTING MORE HOLLYWOOD THERE WAS A TIMEWHEN THEY COULD MAKE A MOVIE WITHOUT GUTTERTALK WHAT HAPPENED?"
4,"As a Joel Schumacher fan since Flatliners, I enjoyed this as well!","This film was cliched, but well acted and directed. One of the few movies by JS that I haven't seen but probably wouldn't like anyway is 8MM-heard enough about that one to give me nightmares. Nicholas Cage and Nicole Kidman played the married couple on the verge of collapse when their home is invaded and have to put aside their pain in order to escape. The invaders have a fool-proof plan, or so it seems.Is this one of Joel's best? No. Is it enjoyable? If you can get past the language, yes. Flatliners was my first movie directed by Joel, liked that too, even though when I saw it I was only 10, believe it or not, (more about that one later on). What I don't understand is why this movie flopped so badly in theaters, with the research I did, that question has yet to be answered. Oh well."
3,The Beverly Hillbillies,"Three great old family shows Pygmalion Ellie, Jed Cuts the Family Tree & The Giant Jackrabbit"
1,Why boher with QPS,"I am not new to CD burners or computers. Being a DP consultant for over 25 years teaches a person about products and service.I have never experienced such poor service from any product, be it computer, autos, fast foods, etc.I can understand poor quality, it's a machine, but I do not understand a company's refusal to supply any form of tech support.Many e-mails and many calls, no 800 number, to tech support produce nothing but frustrations.The unit does produce coasters, but it takes a very long time. A valid burn is something that SELDOM occurs.The rating system lists 1 star as its minimum rating. There should be a zero star option.Save your money."
1,This is insane.,"I bought a QPS back in April, I had configuration issues right away.I followed the tech support format and emailed them. Giving them benefit of possibly being busy or email issues I emailed four times over four weeks from seperate servers. They do not respond through support.Now the hardware failed, I repeated the email attempts with no response and have phone support three times in two weeks to give up in Cue after 45 minutes. No 1-800 number.Now I have a very high phone Bill coming and a useless QPS device that I will eat also.Please don't allow companies like this to thrive, which they all too commonly do in todays market.Buy elsewhere."
3,Bewithced,"The Bewitched Season Three came in quickly, good packaging and I was very happy with the price of the dvd."
4,A Could Have Been,"For people that love Vetttriano, any book which exhibits his paintings is appreciated. This one does more; it's a compendium of paintings with stories and poems that complement and paint word pictures to go along with his film noir vision of the world. I didn't give this a Five Star rating for two reasons: The small format does no justice to the paintings, which seeem claustrophobic in this size, and the selection of paintings featured did not exhibit any of his less seen works. Quite worth the money, but it could have been so much more..."
2,"A definite ""eh"".","I can't agree with the others who think this is a brilliant album, or better than ""In the Aeroplane Over The Sea"" (5 stars from me).I've tried but I can't take it anymore, it's not getting better for me. I think On Avery Island's maudlin, bathetic, self-aware, willfully inpenetrable and ultimately, intensely boring. I'd say much the same about Aeroplane, but on that record it's somehow a good thing (mostly). That and Aeroplane's songs are about 4x as interesting. I like about three tracks On Avery Island, the rest can sink beneath the Tabasco for all I care.Sorry NMH fans, but I'd give this a miss."
5,Made a great gift,Bought as a gift for nephew who has started to collect vinyls and he loved it. Came quickly and was just as descibed.
2,"Cheap, but needs additional software","This is definitely a bargain, but it is all but useless without the Motorola phone tools software. Without the software this is just a USB phone charger (there is no way to access your photos and/or ring tones)."
4,Review of mini USB travel charger,This size is half the size of the regular one. But still have long cords. If there is no cords but a charger holder with outlet that will be much easier to carry.
1,Waste of time and money,"The charger does not work. What a waste of time and money. I guess I got what I paid for, but I hate having to pay for shipping and handling of junk. Maybe this is the way the seller makes money; if you sell enough at this low price, you can make a bundle!!!"
3,"Never loose motorola chargers, you can't use a mini-USB cable instead!",I'm happy to get it at such a low price. When I lost the charger than went together with my KRZR I couldn't even think what a huge problem it was. My phone has a mini-USB port and I knew that my husband charged his old Motorola from ANY computer with a mini-USB cable. I tried to use that cable but couldn't charge it and kept getting error messages. I thought it was a faulty device but looked over the internet and found that Motorola PURPOSELY made their cell phones incompatible with normal USB cables to cause a lot of problems with their customers. I was not able to use my cell phone for several days which was especially upsetting during a trip. One of the reasons I liked Motorolas was that they could charge from any computer's USB port. Now I see I was wrong and my next phone won't be Motorola.
2,Worked for about a month.,"This charger worked for about a month before it just went dead. It was a replacement for the OEM charger that lasted almost five years. I just plug my cell phone into my laptop for recharging now, using a USB cord. It's more reliable than the charger, and costs me nothing which, coincidentally, is what this charger is also worth."
1,Item doesn't work,"Product is damaged. I purchased two, and both had an open at the plug end and will not produce current. I would not purchase again."
1,"Terrible, just stopped working in the middle of the first charge.","This thing was such a bargain, I should've been suspicious. Plugged it into the wall, phone charged for about fifteen minutes, then the charger just stopped working. Tried numerous wall outlets. No success. Returned for full refund."
5,"Same product, tons cheaper than retail","Ordered and received this charger in 3 days! Works like a charm, and didn't have to pay $30 for it retail!"
4,Good thus far,"Purchased as a replacement for my brother's Razr. Seems to work fine thus far, although I have noticed that off-brand chargers don't seem to last quite as long or charge as thoroughly as brand-name chargers. However, for the price difference, I have no complaints."
1,not working,"totally not compatible with my MOTORAZR, through it away. don't bother to return, won't order any thing from this co. not only it won't charge, it will drain battery from my phone."
3,Shipping too much,"Got this and a car charger, the prices were cheap, however the shipping was horrible. Got charged over $12.00 to ship 2 items in same package."
2,Was not a mini usb wall charger,This was not a mini micro usb charger. I was out of town when it came in. Did not open it til recently and it was not a mini charger.
1,Worst Product ever bought on Amazon!,Cheap imitation of a Motorola charger....DIDN'T WORK! Don't waste a PENNY on this junk. Terrible communication with seller. I will continue looking for a WORKING CHARGER. Amazon usually has good products...not this time.
4,good customer service,"The first charger I got didn't work -- it would short out in the middle of the charge so that my phone would never completely charge, even after 8 hours (usually it takes only 2-3 hours). When I emailed the company about it, they promptly sent a replacement charger. A++!"
1,"DOA - useless. Cheap, yes, but that's not an excuse for this...","Bought 3 of these, unfortunately, the first mistake I made was to order mini instead of Micro that we needed, BUT, that said, we do have a few items that take a mini, and they didn't work on those either.I ordered 3, one for sure is DOA - it dawned on me I haven't tested the other 2 for sure yet.SOL since it's too late to return them - but what a waste."
3,"Product fine, shipping speed lousy","My charger works fine. Note that the blades do NOT fold in. I was quite disappointed with the shipping speed. The item was listed as ""in stock,"" but it was a full 5 days before it even shipped."
1,Doesn't charge!,"I bought this thinking that the people who gave it negative reviews must've just gotten defective items. Well, I ordered this, plugged it into my Razr phone, and the phone didn't even read it as there. It didn't charge, no matter how many times I unplugged then replugged it. My suggestion is that if you have a Razr, you should just try and use your computer to charge it. If you have a mini-USB cable (I had one that came with one of my hard drives. Alternatively, you can use the one that came with the Kindle) and a Mac, you can just plug it in and it'll charge. If you have a PC, I don't know the method, but I've read that it's possible as well."
5,Great read aloud,This is one of my favorite read alouds in my classroom. There is a great lesson in the story as Rodney triumphs over adversity. Children love the humor and word play. The book is well illustrated.
5,Great Book - beautifully illustrated!,This is a great book. I actually bought this for my daughter who is an elementary education major - she wants to build up her own 'children's library'. The reason I got it was because my boss's children (two boys who are 4 and 6 LOVED this book last summer and would ask for it to be read over and over again). Lovely book. Sent very quickly and not damaged in transit.
3,Slow-Paced but worth reading,"This is a well-researched account of the Nancy Drew book series. The writing style is dry along the order of a graduate thesis. The larger print of the book makes for slower reading since it's hard to breeze along. It is not until after the first hundred pages that the author gets to the story of Nancy Drew. Along the way, there are long side trips depicting the woman's movement. In fact for a while I thought I was reading the history of the women's movement in the USA instead of the account of the Nancy Drew books. However, the reader does finally learn how the books came to be written and how the series was continued. After a slow beginning, I did enjoy reading this account."
5,Bruder always is the best!,You just can't beat Bruder for quality.If you have a truck lover this is sure toPlease for years!
2,"Nice picture quality, but Bogus Widescreen for Thieves!!","I was pleased with the quality of the picture of these two movies compared to my VHS versions of the films. I thought it odd that Thieves turned out to be widescreen instead of fullscreen (which is what is printed on the box). Unfortunately, IT IS NOT WIDESCREEN!!! I compared the DVD to the VHS of Thieves and realized that for the DVD, they added a black bar at the top and bottom OF THE FULLSCREEN VERSION! So you're seeing EVEN LESS of the movie with the new DVD version in comparison to the fullscreen VHS version! I can't tell you how ticked off this makes me. MGM recently got in trouble for pulling this type of tactic and it looks like Disney is heading down the same slope. BTW, the best part of the movie for comparison is during the Brady Bunch part of the 'Father and Son' song. Chopped off at the top and bottom. Nice. Hold onto your VHS copies of Thieves if you want to see the whole picture."
3,"Not the best, but ok","OK this is totally different from the first aladdin. return of jafar isn't very good once you watch it as an adult because you are old enough to know robin williams wasnt the genie. The story is ok, but it the graphics are terrible and its a fast script. Now the king of thieves is different. I originally thought it was terrible but Robin williams was back and it was funnier. It alsohad a better storyline. And jafar not coming back sucked at first, but how could he? This movie is great for kids but is good for adults because of robin williams jokes. so it doesnt matter if you like just 1 of them. You have to buy them both, which could be good because you dont have to pay full price for each one."
1,OOOOOOOOOHHHHHHHH NNNNNNNNOOOOOOOOOOO!,"I have collected bootleg bloopers from Star Trek since Gene Roddenberry leaked the first out-take reel to the fans. I have seen much better, and have better than the product being offered here. Save your money, spend it on an Aldeberan Shellmouth....anything. Do not waste your money on this trash. I came, I saw, I bought, I kicked myself. Call this recording a REHASH OF TRASH."
1,Awful - Not even 'Bootleg quality' video,"Whoever produced this tape should be ashamed. It is an awful rip-off for Star Trek fans. I think someone sat in a theatre and videotaped the screen to come up with such poor quality, grainy, dark, in-audible material. I had high hopes for a great package of bloopers. This is definitely not it. Buyer beware!"
4,Women's fiction that blends deep emotions of pain and love,"Courtesy of A Romance ReviewWhen reading through Paradise Found, readers can actually feel the pain and hurt like it is their own. The story may be a little melodramatic but if you enjoy a good story with strong emotions and don't mind shedding tears; it is the perfect story for you."
3,Used book The Sound and the Fury,In good condition inside except for scribblings inside cover and on borders of all pages which gives it a very used look!
3,The Sound and the Fury Review,"reasonably timed delivery, didnt know just how used the product really was (not that i care, it just would have been nice to know about all the mark-ups)"
2,Item Not As Shown,"I thought when i purchased this item I'd be getting darts and flights as shown in the photo. However when i recieved the product, the flights were dull and the shafts didn't appear to be stainless steel or chrome like as shown either. That was half the reason i purchased this particualr set."
4,pe class use,"I have used these moonhoppers for over 10 years in my pe classes. They tend to last at least 2 to 3 years before breaking. I have kids from k-8th grade using them year round, not just for a specific unit. The main way for them to break is if the kids stand on the wrong side of the board for too long or jump on the wrong side too many times (or if they are over the 150 lb limit). I really like them. The only draw back is if they do get stood on the wrong side, the ring may come off it is really hard to get it back on since the ball part doesn't deflate very well. They are a lot of fun and can be combined with a jumprope for more challenges, or a hula hoop, or even dribbling a basketball while jumping- all great for coordination skills."
3,"Big impact, little handle",Nice monster maul. Thought the handle would have been longer. Next one I get will have a longer handle.
4,Fun for all,"This is an activity my children have enjoyed at their younger cousins' home, so my husband and I purchased it for our seven year old son. It's great for him; however, the straps are too short. We haven't yet figured out how to extend them (he got the stompers two weeks ago for Christmas and has been distracted by other toys). He has wanted to walk on them down the stairs, but hasn't yet tried (thank God). His older sisters have also had a go at them, somewhat stooped to reach the straps. This is a fun, inexpensive activity that can be done both inside and out and enjoyed by multiple ages. I think the husband and I exceed the weight limit however ..."
3,"Good for those ""off "" days","I own 2 Karen Voight workouts, this being one of them. This is definately the more lower impact and its a good short workout for those days I dont feel like doing too much. I usually combine this however with Tamilee Webbs Cardio assests cardio to make it one hour of cardio. Or I do a 10 min butt workout of hers to add to it. You do get your heart rate up a few times but I am used to stepping and kickboxing, and those plyometric jumps and hops, so it was nice to have a more lower impact workout, which we all need."
5,Great Album,Just bought this album a few days ago. I really like it. At one time or another ive owned all there albums and this one is definitely as good or better then the rest.
5,It rules!,"Well,this album is really good.Umm I would definately suggest it to old and new death metal fans.Ummmm,favourite songs are all except for maniacle,infinite misery and another one.It rules so I suggest buying it if you like death metal and cannibal corpse.So yeah.Eh eh ehhhhhh."
1,People actually buy this excrement?,"This is one terrible album, along with everything this lame excuse for a band has released. Why do people keep purchasing this garbage? There is no variety in Cannibal Corpses ""music"". Here is the song format for all CC songs: a)about 10 seconds of some annoying and pointless guitar noises b)enter sloppy blast beats that don't stop until the end of the song c)retarded lyrics about raping babies and eating dead people d)sloppy guitar work and frantic grunting throughout. I realize that death metal is not known for great lyrics, but this stuff is just stupid. It's not scary, it's not gross, it's just plain STUPID. I wish I could give this less than one star."
5,KILL THEM ALL,"whoaaaa!!! it sounds like a 50 caliber machinegun pounding in your head. relentless chugging recoil mammoth riffs left and right. feel like im in a warzone, its lethal!!! dammit it cause me a headache. lol \m/"
2,Not for cages that aren't made of thin wire.,"I'm not sure what sort of cages these things are meant to latch to, they certainly don't fit on to my smallish metal ones. Maybe if you have a cage with VERY thin bars with no more than 1/2 inch of space between the bars. I'll probably end up crushing these and using them in bird bread, and they're sort of worthless if you planned on having them available for your bird to use in their cage."
2,kept falling off,"Everytime the birds tried to use it, it fell down. They hate it and I do also. the holder was flimsy and cheap, Won't buy anthing like that again, willgo to the petstroe from now on. What a waste!!!!"
1,Stay away from Sharper Image,"This item indicates that it ships in 2-3 days, but after waiting two weeks and still the order has not even ""begun processing"", I called Sharper Image. They said all orders via Amazon don't even *begin* to process until at least 7-10 business days after ordering (almost 2 weeks), then process and ship for several more days. I ordered this for a business trip, and now I've wasted my money and my time."
3,Be Careful on Ordering Tips,"I am fairly happy with the iGo power supply. It came with a tip that worked with my off brand laptop. However, I ordered a tip for my Nokia phone. The tip fitted my phone fine, but it did not fit the iGo cable. Perhaps they have different model power supplies? As I live overseas, and have to have things delivered to friends in the USA who come over to visit, I did not return the useless tip."
3,It's Alright...,I purchased this product and they forgot to send me the 100 pound gripper. Kinda squeaky when I use it otherwise it's a decent product. I wish they'd send me a 100 free of charge though...
2,Disappointing,"There are several forgivable errors in this book that a more thorough proofreading would have fixed.My problem, however, is with the many mathematical inaccuracies. I have read and enjoyed many popular books about mathematics. I realize that it is a difficult trick to write a pop math book that is both accessible to a large audience and still faithful to the spirit of its subject matter. If an author does not feel up to the task, they should just leave it for someone else.This author tries to give the impression that he is letting us in on the clever ideas behind some difficult mathematics. It becomes clear, though, that he has not understood these ideas himself.Kepler's conjecture is a subject that could have inspired a very good book. Hopefully someone else will write that book someday."
5,Outstanding Leather Briefcase,"This briefcase surpassed all of my expectations. The leather is of the highest quality; I've never seen leather that looks so rich. Each one of these is handmade in Italy and it shows. My case actually arrived the next day, overnighted from Tuscany. There are many interior pockets and it carries my MacBook Air easily in the middle one. I can also throw an umbrella in there and paperwork without bulging. I like that it stands upright when you place it down.I've seen it advertised on some sites for $700. Amazon (through a third party seller) had it for $465 and I paid around $250 using points. What an incredible deal. I'll have this briefcase for a long time."
5,Delicious Kitchens.,"This book is full of the most practical yet beautiful small to large kitchens you can imagine. All the history of kitchens is covered with photo's of old paintings to illustrate them. Tons of colour photos, and for only [money] he will build you your own kitchen! This is the best kitchen book I have found. A good addition to it is, ""Dream Kitchens: Recipes And Ideas For Modern Kitchens"" ISBN: 1571458492"
3,Well written potboiler,"Very readable longish short story that suggests but finally eschews supernatural explanations based, as it is, on a real life case. Collins is one of those fascinating Victorian authors (vide Swinburne or the inimitable Oscar) whose lives defied the conventions of their time. Well worth reading for the price."
4,Later Day Saints Story,"Made in 1940 in black and white, story of LDS faith. Vincent Price as Joseph Smith as he aspires to share his faith. Locals fear the multi-wife doctrine and destroy Mormon property. Joseph Smith ends up dead so leadership falls to an uncertain Brigham Young. The story is pushed along by a couple that meets and falls in love.After getting run out of towns Brigham decides they should get out of the country by going West, gold in California is considered an option. Brigham is led that they should try to build a life in the desert which is to become Salt Lake City. But food is hard to aquire and they suffer from hunger. Then crickets attack their crops. They try to stamp the crickets out with shovels with little success. Then, low and behold, sea gulls appear and eat up the crickets.The final shot is of then current day Salt lake City where they have built a monument to the sea gull."
3,Even Atheist Can Enjoy,"Okay, Im an atheist. A fire breathing Objectivist. And I loved this movie. Its so well done that a tiny bit of me converts, I swear to god, at least for the duration of the flick. Explains a lot about what I like about Mormons!Its also a great adventurous tale of pioneering in the olden days when men were men.... The special effects are quite good. Tyrone Power, great as always, and the the woman who plays Zina is hard to forget and very convincing. But maybe I just go in for this sort of somewhat cheesy American individualist against the elements, Oregon Trail, thing.Terrific for late night drinking and rainy afternoons and to inspire that long lost American Pioneer in you. I'm serious!Enjoy."
2,Brigham Young,"I was disappointed with the way the movie portrayed Brigham Young as being unsure about whether he was the Prophet or not. From what I know about the history of the Church, he was very self confident and forthright."
3,espejo,"si refleja pero no es un espejo, como los reales, pero esta aceptable, y a la muchacha le gusto mucho"
4,the message is love...,"he can say more in 5 lines than some writers can say in 500 pages. reading his poems will make you feel good, no matter how bad your day has been."
2,Great music no track names for CD import,"Lame! I tried importing this into Itunes like i do with all my CDs and they havent even registered the track names with the internet music databases out there so I'm going to have to edit track names manually. How lame, almost like a pirated CD."
4,"Good, but lacks ending","I loved the beginnig of this book. The first few chapters grab your attention and hold it wonderfully, but the ending was rather dissapointing for me. It lack the ""triumph of the hero"" that the rest of the book had held. The sense of mist it is surrounded in is wonderfull, though."
5,Excellent!,Excellent product and service! Product exactly as described. Fast and efficient service. Would definitely buy again!
5,What an Aroma,"I placed my order on 8/23 and received my package today 8/27 so we're off to a pretty good start. I haven't used the beans yet but did open the package and WOW! what an amazingly potent aroma, it's intoxicating. I've never used vanilla beans before but am anxious to try them out... and if the aroma have ""staying power"" I'm sure whatever I use the beans in will smell and taste Simply Irresistible!"
5,Really nice product,"We wanted to make a recipe for vanilla bean ice cream and when we went to the grocery store to buy the beans, discovered the Madagascar beans (McCormick) were $14.99 and you only got 2 in a jar. Since that would bump up the cost of my quart of ice cream tremendously, I decided to check online and we found and ordered these beans. I was notified that they were shipped the following day and received them safely in a bubble-pack envelope via USPS about 3 days later. They are long, plump, fresh beautiful beans and they smell heavenly. If you need some vanilla beans, do not hesitate to order these. You won't be sorry."
1,Vanilla Beans,"I was extremely disappointed in the beans. I have been buying vanilla beans for years, from a different source, and have always had quality beans. These beans went bad, mold, before I could even use them. Obviously the bag was not sealed properly. Needless to say, I will not be buying vanilla beans from this place again."
2,"scope may be ok, if they have any unbroken ones","First one I received had a chunk broken out of the top of the lens collar, which was rattling around free underneath the lens cap. The scope itself worked fine when I tested it, but just a matter of time before the lens collar failed entirely. The second one arrived with the lens collar broken all the way through and the lens loose. Did someone drop an entire pallet of these scopes on its side in the warehouse? Not interested in doing another round of receive/return, so will try to find this scope or similar elsewhere."
3,Hockey Trivia,"This book cost almost $8.00 plus shipping it was $13.00; in reality, the book is worth about $3.99. Too expensive for what you get!"
1,Broke within first hour,"I loved the launcher at first. It was smooth to operate and consistently launched the balls high and far. After about one hour of use the strap broke. I put the strap back on and the other side of the strap broke. This time stiking me hard enough in the neck to leave an eight inch raised welt. After puting the strap back on one more time and being a bit more cautious, I launched a few more tennis balls before the strap broke again. I reported the strap problem on the company website and am waiting for a response. I am extremely disappointed (Not half as hearbroken as my dog) since the product worked great but just broke down."
4,Hyper bull,"I have a four year old Red-Setter and we have been using the Hyper Dog ball launcher since she was a puppy. It has been a very good way for my dog to get plenty of exercise. The only problem I have with them is that the tubing breaks. They come with a repair kit, but they are impossible to repair. I am having a hard time finding the Hyper Dog Ball Launcher. I ordered two of these and have already broken one of them and sent it back. Even with the tube breakage I still rate this toy at the top for exercising active dogs."
3,Vulcanize the Rubber,"This product is super if your dog is fully charged. It is a giant wrist rocket that can really launch a tennis ball. Much farther than the average Joe would want to.My dog is crazy and my only complaint is the surgical tubing blows out fast. Man , I have shortened it up and even went through a whole new set from a friend. I am going to order a 50 foot roll of tubing because this wrist rocket is deadly accurate with round ammunition. It is more deadly than my bow and just as accurate. You would not believe the power."
3,It's functional w/o storage,It's not as solid feeling as I had hoped however it works as described. I would have liked to have a bit more shelf space to store items.
1,Piece of junk,"This product is a piece of junk. The ""mirror"" is plastic and is held in place with sticky foam. This warps the mirror creating the ""magnification"". The warping is uneven creating a fun-house mirror kind of effect. In addition, the magnification and warping of the mirror make it so that you can only focus (if you call it that) if your face is 6 inches or less away from the mirror. The variable ""magnification"" is achieved by rotating the ring which puts more warping into the mirror making the fun-house effect even more impossible to deal with and also causing the plastic mirror to pop of from its foam sticky pad. If this product were $5-$10 it might be worth giving it a try because that's about the quality of the product. I sent it back."
2,Mirror fell off immediately but did not break.,"Generally the build quality was good.However, the mirror is stuck on with an adhesive sticker and immediately fell off. The mirror is not stuck in place by anything other than this sticker and if you press it on with your thumbs it dimples creating a fun house effect.I expect I will be able to put it on with a better adhesive. Still, this is designed for a wet environment and you are supposed to be able to increase the magnification by twisting. It is designed to fail."
3,Not as great as I thought.,"I bought this for my husband so that he could shave in the shower, however; it keeps falling off the wall. Originally we thought it was because he had his razor and lotion on it, but he stopped doing that and it still falls off the wall. The good news is it is very durable. For as many times that it has fallen the mirror is still intact and it does not fog up while he is in the shower."
4,a fun book to while away an afternoon...,"This book had an enjoyable plot, and I liked that the main characters actually liked each other early on. Having read Ms. Foley's other novels, I enjoyed learning what happened to Lizzie, and Devlin was wonderfully flawed...a man any woman would love to save! Now I can't wait to find out where Alec goes from here! My only complaint was in her description of Lizzie's students. They were constantly refered to as children, and acted like 7 year olds, yet they were 16! I always thought that most girls during this time in history were considered old enough to marry. As this is only a minor irritant, I would still recommend this book."
2,NOT FOR PC USERS,"I wish someone else had written this review before I had to. NOTE: This book is for MAC users, not for PC users. All of the lessons, and illustrations are done in MAC format. In other words, none of the course material/lessons (illustrated examples) are in PC format. Photoshop 7 for PC menus/selections/tools look and work different than they do in the MAC version. It took me over two hours to fight through the first lesson as the menus and selections that it suggests are not the same in Photoshop 7 for a PC. If you use Photoshop 7 for PC, then this book is NOT for you. If you use Photoshop 7 for the MAC, then this book is for you. Other wise it is totally useless to me.Hope this Helps!"
2,Disposable,"This album is fun for about thirty minutes. There's no real song writing here, just generic beats and some production tricks. Disappointing."
5,One of the top 5 or so discs I bought all last year,Very haunting and addicting work. Can listen to this disc over and over again. Can't understand why this artist has not received more critical and commerical acclaim.Outstanding in every way.
1,3rd edition CD sent with 2nd Edition book,I have just begun the process of the review to obtain the 15 CME. The book I ordered was the 2nd Edition and the review is the 3rd Edition!Frustrating trying to figure out the answers when the material is SO different.
4,A nice story,"This book is written by an author who lives in my town, and to be honest I bought the book strictly out of townish loyalty. But I was pleasantly surprised to find that the story is quite enjoyable and captivating. The story is quite literally entirely about the two main characters quest. Their journey is one of adventure, with attacks from fearsome desert tribes, and wild Felinae, and also a journey of the heart, with 6 of the characters in the end pairing off. This novel is quite enjoyable to anyone who loves sci-fi and fantasy novels"
2,Not an advanced-level book,"While providing a good overview, this book does not provide the information needed for a developer to be productive in Oracle. This is not the book that a serious developer needs sitting by his left elbow as he is coding. I was disappointed in the lack of detailed information in this book. From other 'Unleashed' books, I have come to expect detailed explanations of language elements, and sample code showing how to accomplish real tasks. Language elements are not sufficiently explained; and, while some knowledge can be gleaned from the sample code, the examples were just way too simple to be useful.This book tries to accomplish too much. The first half tries to be a DBA guide, and the second half, a developers guide - as a result, both are given short shrift. Were this book called 'Oracle 7 Overview', it would have served its purpose."
1,Not as pictured,"If you are looking for potato sacks with the printing on them as pictured, you will be sorely disappointed. I ordered 2 of these sacks with the belief that they would have the image and printing of ""Potatoes"" on them. When I received them, the only printing on them said US GAMES. This is not what I needed. The customer service rep. at eSportsonline really couldn't have cared any less. She basically told me that the picture didn't have to be what was represented and refused to even waive the return shipping costs. I will never purchase from this vendor again."
4,Picasso book review,"Nicely illustrated, as expected however, not as exciting as Camille and the Sunflowers: A story about VanGogh. Character development should have been 5 stars. My kids liked it."
1,Almost unplayable,"I was so excited to get the newest system on the market that year, the TG-16. It came with an ok game, ""Keith Courage"". Of course that was beaten fairly quickly and it was time to get more games. You could never try out games before you bought them back then and reviews could usually only be had after the game was out, so you just hoped the games were decent. Unfortunately most of the games for the TG-16 were below average or utter garbage. I haven't played them all, but I know TV Sports Football has to be in the top 5 worst. Everything about the games is bad. Graphics, controls, voices, you name it. I played it because it was all I had, but I cried inside each time I heard ""encroachment"". It happened a lot. I hate this game. If you see it, smash it under your tire or with a hammer or a gavel or a frozen turkey. Do the world a favor and make it disappear. Whatever it takes."
4,Intreiguing reading!,"Anne Rice is one of the best authors out there! The way she gets into the hearts and minds of her characters is outstanding!I found this book to be very interesting, and the ideas she presented about how God and the Devil relate to one another were unique as well. Although I have found some of her other books a little more intreiguing, I really enjoyed this book."
1,I HATED it!!!!:(,"After reading all Anne Rice's vampire books, I could safely say that this is her WORST. It is pointless, tedious, and generally a waste of time!!!! I hate it, I hate it, I hate it"
2,I hated it! How could anyone who loves her books enjoy it?,"I have read the first 4 books of the Vampire Chroniclesand loved them all. They are all action packed and giveus an in-depth view of Lestats life and struggle. NowRice goes into a 400 page long debate on Good versus badand God versus the Devil. I would rather read the Biblefor that. This isn't about Lestat or Vampires at all! Ihad several friends tell me ""Don't read it - it is boringand slow"" But I didn't listen. I couldn't read it past 120pages and I couldn't even get through the cassettes. Ifyou like Anne Rice you should hate this book because ithas nothing to do with her former stuff at all."
5,Great book for lovers of Anne Rice!,"For all of those who love Anne Rice's books, this is Riceat her best. Fast paced and difficult to put down, you hopethat by the time you finish, Rice will have the sequel readyto go.A must read!"
1,NOTHING,"I love the Vampire Chronicles, but this was just one giant prologue. I kept waiting for something to happen. Finally it did, the book ENDED !!!"
1,A literary atrocity,"This book has no redeeming qualities. I miss the days when the Vampire Chronicles were actually about Vampirism. I feel like Anne Rice is desecrating her own characters. I fell totally in love with both Lestat and Louis; and in this book Lestat is irritating and Louis practically doesn't exist. I totally hated the plot. It was boring and pretensious and frankly, just stupid. This was the last thing by Anne Rice that I read. I can't bear to imagine what Pandora and Armand are like. I won't be finding out. I read Memnoch hoping for the magic of the first four books (especially the priceless scenes between Lestat and Louis) and found none of it. I was so disappointed."
2,Anne Rice Fan Visits Hell,"I love some of her writing. I couldn't get enough of some of her writing. Lestat de Lioncourt has to be the best character, and Azriel the earth-bound angel is sex on paper. But this, I found, grated on my nerves and ocular senses.Fascinating as a theological debate. If you want to consider the view that God is not patient and all seeing, and doesn't care about his creations' afterlives; if you want to believe that the Devil is a Fallen Angel only because an impatient God doesn't give his suggestions the time of day; and if you have any interest in Lestat's idea of the Crucifixion, then this is a brilliant read.If you want to see Lestat being a cool collected *reasonable* Vamp, and you think he was the best literary creation of the 1990s, then put this book down. [If you want sex on paper, and a theological read, go order Servant of the Bones. No complaints there at all!]"
3,Not bad,I am a big Ann Rice fan. I did find it a little dificult to get through this book. It just seemed drawn out to me. I did enjoy the story but it couldn't keep my attention as well as the others she has written.
2,"Slow moving and not really a ""vampire"" story","A rather slow moving book that isn't what you would expect for the Vampire Chronicles. This story about heaven and hell could have had any character in it and wasn't really a vampire story. In addition, I found the ending anti climatic and unresolved. The worst of the first five books, in my opinion."
4,a good read,"This was an interesting book, though perhaps not as entertaining as some of the others in the series. It was different and it was thoughtfully done. Was happy to find Lestat again.J. Robert Ewbank author ""John Wesley, Natural Man, and the 'Isms'"""
3,"Memnoch, the Devil Anne Rice","Well, Anne can certainly Spin a grand tale that keeps you turning those pages faster and faster. The subject kept me right up to the very end, then I don't know what the hell happened. I did love her interpretation of God. Someone you can't wait to meet and be with. Jesus on the way to the cross was another superb interp. I felt that she gave so much to the main part of the book that she just so sort of dwindled away. Maybe I lost my focus, but I couldn't wait to see what happened and how all of this was going to come out. I was not satisfied, by any means. Several of her books do that..."
4,A very good book!!!,This book is good- but some of the others are better. The author writes it all with so much detail and the ideas she comes up with are completely fascinating and lovable. Lestat such a cool vampire.
5,Anyone who says this book sucked must not understand the book,"It was very interesting and I've alway's loved Anne Rice's style. She is very descriptive. Also, you have to have a very open mind to read and enjoy this book. She made you think a little."
1,A WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY,"I have read all the books of the vampire chronicles and I am so disappointed in this one. I am unable to finish it after six months of trying to read through this BORING no plot book. It is a major waste of time, the only thing I felt from this book was that it was blasphemy and urked of evil. This book does not keep in the same style of the others and did not belong to be incorporated with them."
2,Not her usual writtings,This was a much anticipated book from her as far as I was concerned but after reading it I was highly disappointed.I had expected to read a book like all the others or better (as I have read everyhing she has written) this however was written like it was written by someone other than Anne Rice.Although I will continue to buy her books this one was a real disappointment to me.
4,Still good!,"This book explores more controversial views than any of her other ones. I certainly did not mind it, it actually made the book more interesting. It made me think about the religious world more clearly. It did drag a bit though. I recommend this book if you like philosophy."
5,Sheer genius at its best!,"This is probably one of the most thought provoking tales Ms. Rice has come up with yet. She has taken the most disturbing and intriuging questions of man and placed it into the heart of a fallen angel. This is not only a tale, but also a vision of how the world and it's heavens exist. Be preprared to be awed."
3,Memnoch The Devil Short Review,"As a tremendous Anne Rice fan I loved her style of writing and her way of making the book so full of details you feel as if you're there, in this book. But this book, I believe, was weak compared to the other books in ""The Vampire Chronicles."" The base of the book was strong suggesting that Lestat was being chased by Satan, yet I feel it got lost with the way in which Rice tried to add in nonsense fluff to the story. I think that she went too deeply into religion, the beginnings of man, and the way she believes heaven and hell will be. I just hope the next one will be better."
2,"Original, yet boring?","I loved the first three books, particularly The Vampire Lestat and Queen of the Damned. This book was extremely boring and I am a person very interested in religion. I think that Rice has an original and interesting perspective on hell and the devil which she divulges in this book but it is so drawn out and rediculously boring. I have almost never found myself skipping pages in a book (last time may have been Grapes of Wrath in 10th grade) but I did that here. Also Lestat turns in to some kind of emotional superpansy in this book and can not make any decisions on his own."
3,jonas421,"A book that's not as easy to digest as the rest of the chronicles, however it offers some deep insight into Lestat.His struggle in this book, and the effect it has on the future of Lestat in print makes it worth the slow read."
4,Deep thought provoking look into creation of hell and evil,"I started devoring the words as I frequently do with alot of Anne Rice material.The bibical facts and information showed much research into the religious lessons many of us learned in school.But, as I read on the thoughts and words from the interpretation of the Devil started to open my mind to a totally new way of thinking. When the last words were read and the story over is when the confusion hit me.Was the whole advevture with the Devil just a vison of a lie?Trust the devil?Never,my mind kept sayin. So did this mean that when Lestat drank the blood of Christ that he became mortal?He didn't want to feed as a vampire any longer.Was the veil of Veronicas' a sign of the Devil's work was to be easier for souls to enter Heaven?Why was the Devil horrified by the loss of Lestats' eye taken out.Was that a symbol of the Helpful dead trying to eliminate the Devils'barter gift? Let me hear your thoughts. Rhonda"
1,"TRASH,TRASH,TRASH; A BIG WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY!!",This was absolutely no way for Lesat to end up! The book was meaningless except perhaps to Anne Rice so she could have her ideas of God and the Devil written down for prosperity. This is literary masterbation
4,philosphical,"Great book if you start it from about the middle. The beggining is not so captivating. Memnoch. Is he really the devil? I mean the devil? I like his story, I believe it's really good, well built. Makes people question things. If you're not fanatic about relligion and you keep an open mind, you'll enjoy this book. Please be patient at the start, it takes a while but it gets really good. The end isn't the best, I can't rate this 5 stars, sorry. I don't claim I fully understand everything in this book, but, it's not so bad and if you'll read the next one ""Vampire Armand""...than you'll find out two things: first, and very important, Armand didn't suceed in killing himself, second, Armand looses his charm in that book, his only excuse is Beethoven...I mean the sonata ""Appassionata"":) That's one 1 star book:(, this one is much better."
2,The Devil and This Book,"Of all of Anne Rice's books this is the one I like the least. I fact, I did not finish it, so I will review only what I read of it. It does not have the charisma of the other books. You really don't care much about what Lestat is doing. While all her books flirt with being a little sacrilegious, this one goes to bed with it. To me it's not so much an entertaining book as maybe one that is dealing with Anne's own questions of religion. That may be fine with some people, but I just want to read about the vampires, not religious conviction. It had a typical great beginning that draws you in, but the more I read, the more I got distracted by my own morals and ethics involved with what was happening to Lestat. I don't need that in my reading world."
2,This blade is better at creating smoke than cutting,"This blade works ok in that it cuts wood, but for resawing anything more than 4"" thick it isn't very good. (I used it in a 16"" bandsaw with a 2HP motor)In resawing Cherry and Walnut it tended to bind and heat up in the kerf, and it burned in Cedar. The Woodslicer 3-4 variable tpi resaw blades aren't much more expensive and provide a much cleaner cut. I've relegated this blade to cutting things that might have nails in them."
5,Novice Paint Selection Experience gives Thumbs Up!,I purchased this book when I wanted to add some color to my home. I am not a designer and I didn't feel very confident trying bolder colors within my home although I liked the feel color brought to rooms in homes I had visited.This book contains large page photographs of living space color usage that you can actually use to imagine the color combination within your own home. The color palate shown in each photo is easily laid out and labeled enabling you to replicate the colors for your own use.I highly recommend this book to not only get your creative energies flowing but also follow through to get the proper colors when you do it yourself.
5,Color me Pleased,"I have several books on color use in interior design. This one has proven the most useful. In addition to other useful chapters there are ones that address specific needs. Do you want to know how to handle dark rooms or what colors to choose as a background for painting? There's a chapter for you. While the authors sell there own paint line, they discuss how to mix your own. I've painted several rooms based on this book."
1,Even Patrick Stewart couldn't save it,"This is a video showing footage of the different satellite landings on the various planets in our system. However, you won't find that. The footage is a mixture of artist renditions and poor computer graphics. Additionally, the poor writing, *really* bad music (Yoko Ono meets Gustav Holst), and Patrick Stewart sounding angry having to read such a bad script made this a poor rendition of ""In Search Of.""We thought we'd found some great footage to share with our children, but what we found was Barbarella's vision of the planets and middle-school level cinematography (spliced together artist renditions and inferior computer animations).The build up of the movie on the cover falsely portrays what you will really find, so please don't waste your time. Please don't waste your honest wages on this movie. Please, please, please don't go there."
1,Worst movie I've ever seen... UNBELIEVABLY AWFUL!!,"This is not only the worst horror movie I've ever seen, it's the worst movie I've ever seen, period. This has to be the cheapest piece of crap I've ever had the displeasure of laying my eyes on. And I dig movies about serial killers. This one just sucks because it's possibly the lowest budget movie that's ever been filmed. This movie literally looks like it was shot on a bad home video camera with cheap stock footage spliced in. The acting is beyond atrocious, and the script is something that could have come from the mind of a 3rd grader, to be generous. DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM!! UNBELIEVABLY AWFUL!!!"
3,the compilation,"to buy this - its a good way to listen to the bands and see if they interest you before you buy their own individual records; i personally bought this collection for the song from superchunk, but learned some of the other songs are just as well off"
1,not as advertised,The description said it was closed captioned and it is NOT. I am hearing impaired and that is why I order this and two others and all of them said closed captioned and none of them were. I sorted through multiple items looking for the closed captioning so I am angry.
2,What's the point? There's better stuff out there.,"This book about betrayal and family ultimately left this listener (I heard it as a book on tape, narrated by Bruce Weitz of 'Hill Street Blues' fame)wondering what the point of the novel was. Nick O'Hara, our protagonist and NYPD detective, is upset when he discovers that his grandfather on his mother's side ordered the killing of his father when he was a boy and was obliquely responsible for the death of his son in a gangland dispute.So, Nick goes after his grandfather by becoming a spy in the family organization. Along the way, he betrays his own wife and breaks his relationship with his father's brother - his only blood relative he trusts. So, while avenging part of his family he ends up screwing up the rest of his family.So, when I finished this dark novel I had to wonder, ""What was the point?"" If you like to watch a man self-destruct - this is your book.Not my favorite piece of literature."
1,bring it on collection,I still have not received this product as of 12/28/2009. It was suppose to arrive by 12/18/2009 and was meant to be a christmas present for my daughter.
5,Great!,This is a great film about being a witness for Christ. It will provoke you to witness and stand strong in spite of oppostion. My prayer is that it will be used to cause any unsaved viewers to search their hearts.
5,Love this lady's piano style,"I ran across this artist on a trip years ago when I purchased one of her CDs in a little NC boutique. I immediately fell in love with her relaxed, ""piano-bar""-style playing and listened to it on my tape player all the way home. That was 5-6 years ago, and online searches never produced another Margie Papajohn recording until now. I'm delighted to have finally located another here on Amazon. Margie Papajohn has become one of my favorite contemporary artists. If you're in the mood for some relaxed, easy piano listening, this is the recording to own. I only wish there were more out there."
2,a bit disappointing,"These socks are a bit long. Easy to get that loose sock feeling, unless you adjust it throughout the foot, to keep the stretch to a minimum at each part. They don't keep my feet that dry/cool either, the area right under the toes gets quite warm/moist---whereas my normal run of the mill white goldtoe socks do not do this. I bought these cause I had recently tried some coolmax type socks, that were really thin and kept my feet a lot cooler. Was hoping for the same experience with these.I would have just given these a rating of three, but actually keeping part of my feet warmer than the generic socks that come in 6 pairs, for a price less than these, at the club_membership style store makes me give it a two.Thinking I should have just gone with the thinner style socks for bikers."
5,Useful,Very easy to use. Lays out fundamentals clearly in a step by step fashion. No math expertise needed to help with high school work
5,A good book from the first page...,"From page one I was entranced by the intricity of this marvelous book. It runs back to the times of the ancients, and uncovers their wisdom in a way never heard before. I absolutely love this amazing book."
3,Hangin' there!,"It pains me too to give Keith 3 stars for his ""rebirth"" cd. But with his latest production, the man is probably just hangin' there! Overall, the production of the faster tracks in the cd was below par. To me, Keith's earlier productions like ""Make it last forever"" & his self titled album containing ""Twisted"" remain the stand outs.However, Keith endears himself to his listeners with the ballads; ""one on one"" is a stand out, as is ""wonderful thang"" & ""show me"". Probably Keith tried to give ""what is it?"" a groove similar to ""Nobody"", and though it did not come out perfect, the track is ok.I guess next time Keith Sweat should take his time before releasing something else, coz I believe the man still has got what it takes to capture his audience."
3,Basically a wildlife adventure story,"Max Brand did an excellent job of relating animal instincts, as well as their fight for survival and leadership. Brand narrated the story in a very meaningful manner in White Wolf's relationship with his foster parent, Mother Wolf. This was the fifth Max Brand book I have read, but it won't be my last. ""The White Wolf"" is probably not one of Brand's best works, but is definitely worth your time in reading."
1,"This is not music, its experimental noise","All this album is, is noise, dont buy it. I like different kinds of music, and i like Pavement, but this album is HORRIBLE! If you really want to experience good pavement CD's buy or listen to ""Crooken Rain Crooked Rain"" or ""Brighten the Corners""..both are superb 5 star albums. The only people who claim to like this album claim to like it because everyone who is honest hates it. It's probably cool to like this album but i guarantee that this CD sits and collects dust on anyone's shelf who owns it. Please, stay away from this one, I WARNED YOU! SPEND AT YOUR OWN RISK!"
1,Good for Nothing,The title of the movie says it all. This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen and would never recommend to anyone.
1,Not what I ordered,Very disappointed!!!!!! I received the wrong product. Got the map of Africa. Just returned from out of town and expected to use the placemats as part of an Black History Month display. I order many items from Amazon. This is the first time I something I did not order.
3,"Good, but since he's produced better I'm dissappointed.","There are some good club songs on this, and it's good but the sound is a bit same-ish, and even the collaborations with people like Ludacris and Petey Pablo can't hide that. The first half of the album stands out as being the best part as the hot joints 'Drop', 'All Y'All' and 'Party People' get you into the groove, but after a while the songs start to fade, well at least until the last track anyway, which is the duet with Aaliyah and Static, which is amazing, and by far the highlight of the album but leaves me thinking, ONE Aaliyah song, no Missy, no Bubba Sparxx, and many other people left out of the list. What I'm trying to say it he produces so many hits that maybe he HAS run out of ideas, which is a shame, cos the Neptunes leave a lot to be desired. If you like it, then fine, but I think Tim's had better days."
4,The Sword of the Rightful King,"The Sword of the Rightful King, a tale of King Arthur by Jane Yolen is a well written book. If the reader likes a more action-packed storyline, you may find this book a little boring at times, but Yolen manages to come through with some amazing plot twists.Jane Yolen tells the tale of King Arthur in a different way than most other writers. She has managed to spice up an old legend with some very surprising twists."
3,Bittersweet re-telling of a well-known tale,"I don't really know what I was expecting when I picked up Sword at work one day, but it was actually quite absorbing. Although it read like an episode of Camelot High sometimes, Yolen does know her stuff. I saw the twist at the end coming from about mid-way through the book (there are clues), it was nevertheless a poignant and bittersweet ending, since we know there really is no happily ever after... not in Camelot."
3,Interesting Book,"I purchased this book for an amateur pilot. It was perfect for him and the entire family. However, when I ordered this product, I received a copy that has what appeared to be coffee stains on the front. Luckily, they wiped away easily. However, I would be cautious about buying this book online."
4,It's easy to setup and use!,"After reading all the reviews we decided to get this product. I can say I don't mind sitting down and working out. assembly was very easy. I really like the ability to adjust the resistance in the arms. Some days are a faster lower resistance workout and others I raise the level and go for power.The only complaint I have is the bushings in the arms are hard to keep tight. The did squeak a little but some WD40 type lubricant fixed that. Another complaint, not the fault of the rower, is I have a big belly and it's hard to get all the way to the front to register a stroke. Like I said, not the machines fault.Overall a great way to exercise, I would have given it a 5 except for the issues with the bushings!"
4,Almost excellent,"Received the package when promised, very easy to connect all the components and ready for use. The project took less than one hour. All components seem to be of good quality and the rowing does not produce any noise. I did not give 5 stars because does not include an instructional cd on how to row properly. However I found plenty of info on You Tube.Thanks Amazon for the great service."
4,Great study product!!,"Received my new rowing machine ahead of scheduled delivery date. Easy to assemble and very accurate directions. It is virtually silent while using it and can watch television without even raising the volume. Seat is comfortable and handles are nicely padded. Very smooth operation. Digital display is easy to manipulate and works wonderfully. Also, adjusting the tension is incredibly easy with just the loosening of a screw, readjust and then tighten. Would definitely recommend to a friend. Unbelievable price too!"
4,Great Product,Pretty easy to put together. You just need to remember the instructions on part are right side up and you have to put it together upside down. Didn't take long and it works great. You are going to have occasional squeaks. No big. Resistance is easy to set. I recommend this product for the money.
2,Too stiff to row,"If I were stronger, this product would have worked fine. But I am barely strong enough to pull the levers back on the easiest setting and can't get a smooth motion going. My husband is strong enough for it but I bought it for me. Also, the knobs are hard to turn to adjust the tension. If I could have gotten it back in the box, I would have returned it."
2,Disappointing,One of the shocks broke on this machine after very little use. Metal just snapped apart. Replacement piece is $24.99. Debating whether it is worth it . . .
5,great excercise,"This sturdy well built machine gives you a compact size compared to others with a comfortable seat and the extras of the timer, calorie count, etc. Price can't be beat!"
2,"Good idea, but product could use some improvements","The mat is too small and is not rigid enough. Unless your baby is on the small side for the recommended age range of the product, they will soon outgrow the mat. Also, the mat is soft and doesn't stay put when in use causing for constant adjustments during play."
2,Cheap and uncomfortable,"My daughter hated tummy time, she would struggle to prop up so she could see things, so I thought she might like this little gym. The mat is way too small, when she was on the spinner in the middle her head extended almost all the way out past the edge. There is also no way to strap a baby in, so you end up with a young infant dangling in the air off a piece of plastic. When she got tired she still flopped her head to the floor, only now her neck is resting on a plastic edge. The cover for the spinner is also just a piece of cloth, not much padding to it.Overall, good idea but bad in practice. If your baby is old enough to be safe/comfortable playing on it, then they are old enough not to need it.Very uncomfortable, and my daughter hated it."
2,Not that great,"My son hated this. He cried most times I put him on it. It is great quality and the mat has great sensory items, but the ladybug was anoying and not fun for my son."
2,Depends on the baby,"The usefulness of this product really depends on the baby. My daughter HATED tummy time and this product made no difference. I wouldn't pay full price for this again without trying it out first. It's a great concept, but doesn't hold up in reality. And it would only be useful for a month or two. Maybe the mat would be fun later without the lady bug in the middle..."
3,Cute Idea...,My daughter is now 5 months old and has had this for about 2 months. She's not too thrilled w/it yet but each time I put her on she plays a little bit longer. I think w/in the next few weeks when she has a bit more strength and body control that she'll enjoy it more. I have purchased a baby play mat that has a small U shaped pillow that velcros to it and she definately spends more time on her tummy on that.
2,Lamaze spinner,"I liked the piece of equipment,but the baby was a bit too old for it - 5 mos. I'm not sure a baby younger than that would do much with the product. Suggest they make it a bit larger, so larger babies can use. Good to develop upper body strength."
3,A HUMDRUM HISTORICAL MYSTERY,"This is the first book I have read by Ms. Emerson and it was no great shakes. There are other authors of historical mysteries that are much more descriptive of daily life and produce a much richer overall mystery (see my other reviews).This novel has Susanna,Lady Appleton as detective extraordinaire. To me it seemed that Lady Appleton's serving girl Jennet did a better job of sleuthing than did Lady Appleton.Susanna, in all her piety, has to help her dead husband's mistress Constance and Constance's cousin Lucy clear their names of witchcraft before they go to the gallows. This seems pretty strange to me. Susanna also has to outmaneuver her boyfriend's sly and hateful mother."
4,Its just a box,It works. Maybe a little high priced for a piece of plastic but I couldn't find any at my local gun shop. it is nice for organizing my reloads for the firing range.
5,Will last a long time!,"I've used MTM ammo boxes for years, and have never found anything better. They are sturdy, and stay shut under abuse. I have never had one break or fail in any way."
4,MTM 100 round flip top ammo case,"I bought this to store 100 round boxes of ammo for my 9mm. The 100 round Winchester box comes loose so the bullets just roll around inside the box. This little box is perfect to hold them in place and keep them from banging together. The case has good clasps to keep it shut and it is very sturdy. I also like the fact that it is made in the USA. I would have given 5 stars if I could put the bullets in upside down. The case only allows you to put the bullet in top up. This makes it a little more difficult to get the rounds out. Otherwise, good product for a good price. Fits well in small range bags as well."
4,Very Sturdy Box,This box is very sturdy and well made.I was totally expecting some lightweight chinsy piece of plastic that would warp when filled.I was very surprised at the thickness and solidness(real word?) of the box.Will definetely order more and recommend and give out to friends.Well worth the price.
2,4-Star Average? Seriously?,"After reading the mostly positive reviews of this film my family and I decided to check it out for ourselves. This first half of the movie is awfully slow and we almost turned it off. A woman(Mira Sorvino) goes to a secluded cabin for some alone time, but there is a ghost(Shane West) trying to communicate with her. Will it try to harm her of help her? Another ghost shows up later in the movie with a gift for gab, but the primary ghost doesn't mutter a word until the very end of the movie. West's ghost character walks around with an angst-ridden look on his face for 1 and 1/2 hours and then let's out a moan and two words at the conclusion. We stuck with it, and by the end it became more interesting - I like the idea of ghosts whispering things into people's ears, giving them strange ideas. Overall, it was worth watching but far from the great movie that many have claimed."
1,Are you kidding?,I could not agree more with the other 1 star critics the movie is all bad I through it away after an hour or so of viewing.......What crap!!!! I will always tell it like I see it.Scott M
4,Great Chiller,Please make sure that you have a home theater when watching this movie or any other horror movie. Lights off please and get ready to be scared.
5,Now that these are inexpensive...,"With bluetooth and WiFi, this is a great little handheld with decent connectivity. When it was new, it was rather pricey, but now it's quite affordable and genuinely useful."
3,guitar fingerpicking,good for learning picking technique but can be a little hard to follow for some one just starting to learn guitar
1,"Missing Tablature Book - ""Used/scratched -up"" DVD","I requested a ""new"" product but one of the DVDs was severely scratched-up and as a result, did not work correctly. It was obviously not a new DVD. Also, the Tablature book was not included (but was included in the product description). Not too useful without the Tablature book. Too bad, it seemed like it would have been a great product."
4,Breathtaking and classic,"I've been eyeing a TAG for quite a while and did my homework. This watch is simply beautiful. It is substantial but not clunky. The features are sharp and distinctive. It goes with absolutely everything. It's sporty enough to be casual but is classy enough to wear with a suit. One caveat: potential buyers should know that the watch comes with an amazon.com warranty, not the standard TAG Heuer warranty. The price makes up for it, but amazon should make it clear that is not an authorized reseller."
4,Tag Link,"Excellente service from amazon, the delivery and the watch ...only negative point, the guarentee its not from TAG whic is international"
3,Umm...,"I was really hoping to like this book a lot. I ordered it used and am sort of glad that I did. To begin with, the author writes in sort of an obnoxious way. About every 5 sentences or so he uses the phrase ""according to one source"". That gets a little old after the first chapter, Im not kidding he actually uses this like every 5 sentences. Add to that the author seems to have a somewhat negative view of Santeria. He wrote this book about Curanderismo and mexican folk practices and sort of makes a comparrison that curanderismo is good and santeria is bad. He also calls Brujeria black magic. I think the author needs to do some better research before he writes these things. I will say that the actual herbal section is pretty well researched and has some usefull information. All things considered buy this one used, it's not worth full price."
4,Nicely follows the series,"Long long ago in the 70's when I was a kid I got to watch Danger: UXB on PBS with my mom. Feeling a little nostalgic I decided to pick up the TV series again to see if it was as good as I remembered. While ordering the DVD I saw there was a book from the series and decided to order it. While the story telling is a little flat and impersonal, like an off-stage person describing a play or tv show, there are some excellent descriptions that elaborate on things the TV series didn't show as well. I'm rating this one 4 stars mainly because the author was very true to the series. I was hoping for more elaboration on the TV series plot but really this mainly followed the series and you don't get as much of Sgt. James as you do in the series (Maurice Roves was great in this role). A nice read, but no major additions to the series."
4,Tips were fine but stethoscope was too old,The eartips were well made and if they had fit the stethoscope they would have been fine...the problem was the stethoscope at the senior center was so old they eartips did not work so I went ahead and bought the senior center a new stethscope.
5,Took a Chance,"I have a older model Littman Master Cardiology stethoscope with the screw style eartips, bought these because I needed some fast and hard to get the threaded style fast, I could have used these by just pushing on tube and they held well enough that I doubt they would come off. But I pulled the old ones off the threaded adaptors, then unscrewed the adaptors from the stetoscope tube and pushed the new ones down the tubes of the stetoscope till I could screw the adaptors back on, then pulled the ear piece over the adopter and was back to original."
4,Finding your true self,Very interesting story showing how your beliefs can be turned in a different direction.Life values change when you see more clearly.
5,Good book,We took my 3 year old granddaughter to a small circus and she loved it. This book helped to keep the memories alive without being too loud and overpowering. It opened up the opportunity to use her imagination and her memories together.
3,A Bit Disappointing,"Found a lot of the questions too simple for adults, maybe more challenging with young children. We avoided the instructions and pretty much made up our own rules."
1,Dumbest game on t he planet,"This game was so lame and NOT fun that after playing it once we thought Candyland would have been more challenging! The questions were way too easy so therefore the first player got to $1,000,000 and then the game was over. I do not recommend it at all."
2,Not impressed,"It is not the most well thought out game I've played. The rules are way too long and confusing, we just ended up asking each other the questions. Don't recommend."
2,A little on the lame side,The problem is it doesn't really play like the TV game and that's what people want. And you have to read the cards through red plastic to reveal the answer -- how low-tech can you get? We weren't very happy and ended up just reading the questions to one another.
1,Disappointed,"I din't receive that I ask, and never had an answer of the seller. In few words... a lost my money."
5,A MUST read for anyone even considering home education!!!,"If you only read one book about home education, make it this one!!! It reads fast, is jam-packed with valuable Biblically-sound wisdom from those who have successfully lived it out.I first saw Chris Davis speak at a home education conference back in the late 1990's. He spoke for about 45 minutes and it completely revolutionized our thinking toward training our children. One of the main points he made was this: Education is not the filling of a bucket, but the lighting of a fire.Chris and his wife, Ellyn, come from a lineage of public school teachers/administrators. I can't think of anyone more qualified to debunk the failed public school system and it's wrong approach to instructing children than this Godly couple."
5,Classic and necessary,"This indie opera (a terrible label, I know) is simply transcendent. It is a must for every single music lover.Jeff Mangum, the singer and more or less the brains of the operation, writes amazing songs. They are carefully meshed together in a single album; once you start playing track one, you are obliged to hear the entire LP to the end.Their instrumentation is also layered and complex. The use of horns and the saw works to create a pervasive mournful mood. Comparisons have been made between this album and ""Pet Sounds"" and it definitely merits such a lofty association."
1,"it broke the glass off my monitor, get singing lessons!",I really think singing lessons are a path in which this artist needs to travel. Although I really do not believe the lessons will help that much. As for the music it should be recorded at a higher volume to cover up the vocals.
1,Don't let the hipsters fool you,"This is the most painfully pretentious pile of dreck ever produced. I know quite a few people who swear that Neutral Milk Hotel are the greatest thing since Oreos, but the off-key singing, overwrought lyrics that try REALLY hard to be deep and touching and the headache inducing lo-fi production make this one of the least impressive widely loved albums. Actually, It's a mystery to me why people like this band so much. I mean... I understand that you have to like some things to be considered hip, but Neutral Milk Hotel cover up talentless bass playing by layering so much fuzz on the bass that there is a low-end buzz through the whole album that makes my teeth hurt. Do yourself a favor, listen to the song ""Demented Man"" from Warrior on the Edge of Time by Hawkwind. Every Neutral Milk Hotel song is an attempt by a sad hipster to duplicate this rad tune from the 70's."
1,Great CD for the Tone-Deaf,"I eagerly anticipated this CD based on the many favourable reviews listed here, but I was sorely disappointed. The vocals are horribly off-key and remind me of raking finger nails on a chalk-board.It appears that people feel passionately about this CD -- they either love it or hate it. Not for music-lovers."
4,Nothing Neutral About It...,"I was getting lost in the revues of Amazon, as I do sometimes. I just happened to come across this band and was intrigued by what people had said about them. I am typically drawn to the underdogs of the music world, you know, the guys who never get the credit they deserve. I decided to give these guys a chance. I was very pleased with my decision. The music is simple and sweet. The vocals are saturated with feeling. The lyrics... poetry. This album isn't about being on the radio. It's not about being famous. I'm not even sure if it's about being an album at all. It's more like... ""this is my voice, this is my guitar, would you like to listen to me play?"""
5,Music doesn't get any better...,"Simply remarkable. This CD changed the way I evaluate music. I've been reading CD reviews for a while, and perferences being what they are (so very personal) it is always hard to tell if you're going to like the music, even if everyone else loves it, and many ""alternative"" reviewers seem fixated on mellow, boneless music..the kind that reminds you you need to visit your grandmother in the nursing home and feed her some tapioca. But this CD lives up to the hype. The music is insistent, and urgent in a soul-deep, biorythmic way that is very hard to explain."
4,"Oh oh, oh -- Magnum meets","I only just heard Neutral Milk Hotel a couple-o-days-oh-go with this album.Admittedly, I hated it the first three times."
5,never heard of the band before,"I just listened to this cd for the first time this morning. I don't know why I have never heard of this band before. I found it by looking at the recomended items from amazon and I now want to buy another of their albums.I am sure not everyone will like this. I can't even really describe what kind of music it is. But the sound clips give you a good idea. I like this kind of sometimes somber sounding music, and I love the saw and trumpets."
1,One of the best 90's cd's? Yeah right....,"I know when someone posts a one star review to a really highly praised album, its immediately followed by angry responses. but here me out when I say that this is highly overrated. Now there are some good moments here and there on this disc, but they are not worthy of all the praise. This is a mediocre cd at best by a mediocre band with a pretentious name. What exactly is a neutral milk hotel? Anyways, the point being that there are plenty of other cd's that deserve this kind of recognition that are relatively unknown still, such as: ink and dagger's self titled, soul coughing's irresistible bliss, and arcwelder's pull.... I could go on, but I think you get the point. Its dissapointing that mediocre stuff like this gets all the hype but real quality stuff goes largely unnoticed. Oh well.."
4,Gospel Album,"Gospel Album, August 15, 2006Reviewer: XraySpex - See all my reviewsThe music is great. I don't have the slightest problem with the guys voice either. I could care less if a person hits notes. I will take a voice that expresses an emotion rather than hits notes anyday. That said his lyrics are many times infuriating. When he sings stream of conscious ones dealing with a surreal reality they are great and have meaning. The problem is his education. He spews out the religious and spirituality dogma of the ignorant masses. Jesus is dead. People do not have souls, they have brains, and ghosts are a ridiculous concept. He sings about these things as if they exist. Step into this century and take some science classes before you continue to brainwash the masses as our whole culture does with these idiotic ideas. This is a gospel album that all you ignorant, uneducated, morons out there will love. Enjoy."
1,not really that good,"Alot of people want and like to say this album/band are really good, but the truth is, it/they are not really that good. It is a very bland album. Basically a modern version of The Beatles entire catalogue, only without all the genius that those songwriters had. People really need to stop saying albums are good just because the ""style"" is good. This songwriting is just not that good. It's an album just like all the other albums it is comparable to, by the bands they are comparable to. Albums by the shins, and apples in stereo: boring albums that sound sort of like modern kids influenced by a mix of The Beatles and Punk Rock, with a couple good pop songs somewhere on the record. Much, much better pop and rock records have been made over the last 40 years that people should by before ever buying anything like this. sorry."
5,Sue Grafton Meets Erma Bombeck,"This is a clever tale, delightfully told. The reader is introduced to eminently believable characters with the kinds of quirky personalities that make them seem to be old friends. The story line doesn't suffer as we get some gratuitous insight into the life of senior officers on a major military installation and learn a bit of the history of ""Generals Row."" Not since Inspector Clouseau has a malefactor been dogged by a more zany team of crime fighters. This is a fun read, an interesting mystery without the endless pages of psychobabble and introspective belly button gazing found in many current mystery books. We're eagerly awaiting the next installment!"
1,Direct Selling CD's By Neil & Dana Pillips,I received these CD's a while back with a few other books to read on Direct Selling. Tonight I go to play them and they are EMPTY. Hopefully I can get them replaced. We will see and I will keep u informed.
5,Disney Princes Stories Vol. 2,My Grandkids love this series of videos. They watch them over & over & over again. Always a hit when they come over.
2,Terrible,"This is a cheaply made video by Disney. I expected more from them with this. Basically, taking clips from the old movies and cutting scense out with a voice dubbed story. Please do not do like me and waste your money on this."
2,shoddy product from Disney,"I agree with everything the previous reviewer said. The Snow White cartoon is nothing more than a few still frames thrown together to form a semi-interactive story about making pies. The other two cartoons are full motion, but they feel even flatter than the Snow White slide show. These look like the typical dribble of afternoon cartoons being cranked out by writers who lack the time, talent, or inspiration to put a decent story together. There's so little in common with the original productions, that its hard to believe you're watching Disney.From now on, I'll stick to their movies."
3,An informative book,"The book was intersting, but a bit to brief for my liking. The actual story of the Unabomber life took less than 150 pages. The book details each of his bombings and suggests the reasoning behind the target and M.O. Douglas also takes you through his thoughts in the investigation. Many readers feel Douglas is a bit arrogant in his writing. I do not agree with that opinion, nor do I feel this book is written that way.The rest of the book was not very interesting outside of the inclusion of the full manifesto of the Unabomber. The manifesto contains nothing shocking, but contains what you might expect an outsider hermit radical to say. I'm sure there are better books about the Unabomber than this, so I suggest you try a more detailed account."
1,dark tales,Another terrible Hoffman on DVD. This one is so dark that scenery and costumes are almost impossible to see. Almost everything is in shadows. If you want a headache this is the performance to see.
4,"Football, So Cool Even Am American Hilljack Could Get Into It","This movie involves football, the european kind, not American. The movie revolves around soccer, but in so doing the movie taps into the basic human motives, such as revenge and greed. One man is on a mission to show another man, who made him feel small, that is every bit as good at what he does as the other man. In the process, we are left with the turmoil that results from pursuing these emotions to their fullest. We are left with failure and agony. This movie reflects this with great ease as it shows how this process unfolds through strong writing and great acting. Get it and enjoy."
4,first Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa movie I Loved.,"I watched this movie the first time on television and they took out the naughty bits "" I was only a child then"" a mere 43 and fell in love with Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa. The movie is about a journalist who gets killed by who knows in the mob and the revenge taken by her brother and sister. It introduced me to the meaning of Honor from the other side of the world. Except for the gratuitous sex,the movie has a good plot but acting was a little stiff. Even Robert Davi was sticklike in his performance. But, for some reason I loved this movie. Joel Grey has a part that he played like wet cardboard,not very useful as if added in for flair. Even after all that I love the movie anyway."
1,Doesn't work,I was sent broken phone. The phone would not take calls or send calls only text capable. Peace of junk!
1,Terrible phone,I had to get 3 phones before i got one that finally worked. The first 2 didn't work at all and after i called the guy who had them he sent a 3rd one and it finally worked but what a hassel it was !!!!!
3,a good basic Phone,It is very limited but good basic phone...not able to get any covers for it..and it shuts off really easily
1,Oops,I attempted to purchase a cheap VERIZON cell phone to replace a broken one.... You get what you pay for. For $25 I got a cell phone that could not be used with my Verizon plan. It was an Alltel phone. Nice!! Oh well....
2,Cell Phone,Received the cell phone with the wrong charger to it. I had to purchase a charger on ebay. Would be more careful in the future with ordering cell phones outside of large companies.
5,Reliable phone,"I've used this phone for a year. Everything works as when I first received it including the battery, while my wife's Nokia6236i had completely failed."
3,21st Century Blues,"It is hard to love a phone in 2006 that cannot sync with your computer out of the box. A 500 entry phonebook is nearly useless with keyboard entry.I have a Macintosh, the phone has a Bluetooth connection and I have to buy a USB cable and load another piece of software to load my 230 Address Book entries and my calendars. This is not acceptable when I compare it to my (outgoing) circa. 1999 Eriksson T39.The LG VX8300 is bigger, less user friendly, and (frankly) less attractive. Without Bluetooth connectabilty to my computer it is less useful. My 15 day warranty has 14 days left."
2,Item arrived slightly damaged,"I ordered this tool because I needed them in order to pass the US Coast Guard test to become a Licensed Captain. The Parallel rules arrived and were bent, bent enough that it could not be used to accurately plot Lattitude/Longitude or fixes on a chart. I had to use a shorter set that I purchased at a local marine supply store and luckily I was able to pass the test. I was very disappointed (and angry at first) that I could not use the rules and could possibly fail the test because of it. I chose not to return the item after the test as it will rarely be used.I wasn't particularly pleased with Customer Service's response either, as they showed little sense of urgency to get these replaced ASAP."
5,Loved it!,"I have never heard nor seen any other version of this opera.............based on some of the comments, I would guess there have been better productions. That may be, but this production is great. The orchestra, chorus, and singers put on a great show..................the Rossini music is sublime of course, and Ramey alone is worth the price of admission. Highly Recommended."
4,Heckuva Read,"Awesome piece of writing.Well developed characters.Great plot.I found it very hard to put this book down.Natalie pulled me into the story completely.Having studied LDS culture and some of the fundamentalist groups it has spawned for the past decade,I would say she pretty much hit the nail on the head.If I have one criticism though,it would have to be that I could have done without the graphic sex scene.I don't think it added anything to the story.Be that as it may,the thrilling climax was not a letdown.This would make an excellent TV movie.Kudos to Ms.Collins"
3,Kaye is great but why mix this way?,"I grew up on ""Danny Kaye for kids"" and looked for it for my baby girl but it is not available easily so i thought i'd go for the large collection. The main problem is the kid songs are all mixed in with the adult ones and that makes hard listening which is diappointing (though Kaye is great as usual and the quality recordings are too)."
2,"A Bad Book, Literally","Plenty of good photos and recipes, but the pages have started falling out. Cookbooks should be bound to last and this hard bound book is really poorly made."
2,Good annoying rattle,"The levers are good, I used them on a (much beloved) restoration project, Specialized eighties steel frame road bike. They're way better than the cr*p levers I got in the recycle bin. Tight, nice curve when riding on the hoods. Unfortunately, there are these odd little plastic widgets set inside the lever itself that rise up with vibration and create a really irritating rattle. Not sure how to fix this other than yanking and discarding them. If this get's resolved (like, I find a shimano doc that says yoink them) I'll re-rate these a 5."
2,Suction cup came off in 5 minutes,"Very disappointed- within the first few minutes of normal play, one of the suction cups on Spidey's hand came off. The cup was not re-attachable - it had been glued in place. Buy it only if you are a collector who plans to store it on your shelf. Not durable for kids."
1,Not the classic Ace comb,"Ace hard rubber combs have become harder to find at local merchants. Ordering this set of 6 seemed a convenient solution.Be warned, these are not the same combs. They are not much more than half the size of the combs I have bought in stores, and the first one I used broke within one month of first use.These combs get one star only because it is not possible to give zero stars."
4,great price,I always lose these things and after a few times and having to repurchase it again. I found a great bargain on a great product.
3,Would have gotten 5 stars if the product sent to me was correct...,"The classic combs shown in the photo are fantastic combs that hold up quite well, after being sat on and everything. They are sturdy and work well. My only issue was that I was sent the fine-tooth combs instead, which are much more cheaply made and are sure to break and fall apart fairly quickly. Amazon has fantastic customer service though, and refunded my money for these, since I didn't receive the correct thing. :)"
5,My Face For The World To See,"This book is very entertaining, and it's a shame that it's out of print. Liz, who is best known as a star of one of John Water's films (DESPERATE LIVING), was a woman with a lot of chutzpah and cujones. She was independent before being so was acceptable. She lived life her way, without regrets, and this book tells it in unadulterated detail."
3,Wish I could have used it...,"Got this oil burner for my mom for Christmas. Unfortunately, it arrived broken so she was never able to use it. The hook attached to the moon was missing/broken off and therefore she was unable to hang the oil bowl. The bowl also came with paint rubbed off in certain parts. I'm returning it, but considering trying to purchase it again once I get my refund - for some reason I wasn't able to do an exchange, not sure why. Definitely a bummer considering it was a Christmas present."
4,Economical Purchase,"I have Linux Ubuntu and I was able to get it to work. I had to go to a forum to realize that the software it comes with (only for windows) isn't really necessary. The setup was easy once I found the internet address for the router.The price was very reasonable and it works really well for the most part. The one drawback is that on my laptop, it seems to periodically lose connection than regain it immediately afterwards even though the signal strength is at 4/5 bars. This happens about once every few hours. So I wouldn't trust it for downloading something more than a few hours. I have a fast connection so that really doesn't stop me."
4,Historically Better Than Most,"A good choice for one of the few film portrayals of white and indigenous peoples relations. Filmed in the state where the majority of the events took place, it follows the factual bones of the story of Cochise and Tom Jeffords fairly well. Of course, Hollywood has to sneak in somewhere and the the romantic involvement holds the most obvious fantastical expansion. However, even that angle shares many tidbits about the Apache lifeways that hold true: the lack of kissing, men plucking facial hair vs. shaving, honeymoon wickiups, rituals for feminine coming of age, etc are culturally accurate of the Chiricahua Apache tribe. A glaring short-coming of the film is the depiction of lead Native Americans characters by white actors.I used this film in my studies of AZ history and recommend it highly."
2,only for junk(ie) wannabes,"this is noise. not music. looking for music? there's none here, sorry. this is unlistenable. this is proof that drugs are not all good. the reviewers that like this like the idea of heroin and music about heroin by people on heroin while they fantasize about being a hipster junkie doing heroin. notoriety in private life does not necessarily make a good recording. its a lot easier to claim this is great than to actually have to endure it. the two stars are for the glimmers of talent that eke through the sludge every so often. neal and jennifer have talent. cleaning up has shown this, as recordings after this have a coherency that slimes its way through the yowled vocals and fumbling notes. note to admirerers of twin infinitives: coherency is not a bad thing. try it sometime. and also, do some heroin & discover that its not as cool as you think it sounds."
5,i love beach music,while stationed in Virginia Iwas exposed carolinabeach music. I was raised on radio and I was amazed at How much I had missed over the years. this is great oldies and many are hard to find anywhere and they are not on any oldies station playlist.
4,T-Rex debunked,"Well done semi-documentary which combines computer animation with real life scientists on an archaelogical expedition in Montana to dig out t-rex fossils. Most of the info surmises that the legendary t-rex was more of a scavenger than a predator. Excellent video to start the discussion, whether you believe that to be true or not."
4,Quality Toy That is a Bit Large for Baby...,"Lamaze makes a very high quality soft toy. Like the others my grandson has been given, the Clutch Cube Baby Toy is very well made. The seams are securely sewn. The different fabrics offer differing tactile experiences to stimulate baby's sense of touch. The bright colors are visually stimulating. The hard rings are wonderful for gumming when baby's teeth are coming in. The hidden panel which opens to reveal a mirror provides the element of surprise to entertain baby.My only criticism is that this cube is rather large and is hard for younger infants to handle. I question whether older infants who are large enough to handle this toy will find it interesting. For a six month old who is very interested, this toy is just too large to handle and Grandma ends up manipulating it to entertain baby."
3,Has all the right features for a first toy...,"On its surface, this seems like a total perfect first toy: black and white, contrasting colors, mirror, rattling, crinkly...but it is kind of big for a baby or small child. I know it doesnt look it, but both of my kids had a hard time picking it up with their little hands and really getting to all of its features."
5,Another great product from Lamaze,"Like the other toy I purchased from Lamaze, this is high quality and very entertaining for my baby. The clip make it literally a snap to attach to her bouncer. I will be buying more from Lamaze. She loves these toys."
3,eureka vacuum cordless,"It is a very good vacuum cordless, I baught it a 6 years ago and I'm very satisfy, and will buy another one"
3,I agree . .. a mixed bag,"Space opera tale of a universe where human society was almost wiped out by machines it created. In the aftermath, there are several groups vying for control and several bear tongue in cheek names to organizations we would recognize.Apparently, when the machines had almost destroyed Earth, some human chose to stay and fight and the others, believed to be cowards, fled to another galaxy.Wormholes, which are sort of like short cut tunnels or teleportation, discover these cowards who have created their own society.Tension rises when all the vying groups find out there is a technology on this planet which would tip the scales in favor of whoever controls it.A fair read but disjointed at times. Some character motivations are lacking and even though there are some really cool ideas in this tale, they aren't fully mined."
2,A slog -- I gave up,"I love sci-fi and I've read a lot of books that took some work to read -- the Mars series by Kim Stanley Robinson, the Otherland series by Tad Williams, etc. Those books were hundreds of pages long, but I stuck with them because they made sense, had engaging plots and characters, and kept my interest. Try as I might, I couldn't get through these 300+ pages. Just too much work for something that should be fun. Read a few pages and you'll see what I mean."
3,Very good but not his finest,"Ken MacLeod has created another fantastic world (or universe, really) to play in. He is one of the few authors who manage to make Space feel huge, yet accessible. Without recycling his previous ideas, Lucinda Carlyle's world is expansive and filled with a great variety of people.Lucinda Carlyle is a refreshing change from super powered, super smart, super lucky heros. She is heroic, but a bit ill-starred. Her adventures are planned, but not foolproof, and while she can certainly handle her self, she is not the only competent person in the room.On the other hand, the plot feels poorly paced. I would have preferred more urgency at times, it feels a bit pedestrian. I would have liked to sense some worry from characters who are waiting for things to happen, rather than a bit too much complacency.On the gripping hand, I loved the language. The dialect of the Carlyles never felt contrived or unnatural.Overall a very good read, certainly worth the purchase."
3,Hard to read.,"This book was hard to plow through, you'd need a Masters in the Sciences to understand a good chunk of this book. Cut out all the needless scientific junk & the story line could be good."
1,Stunningly Bad,"Fascinating that a product this incredibly bad made it to marketplace. Even after sharpening not one knife could cut a zucchini. You will get a sharper, more even, and certainly safer cut by using your teeth. Plastic cutlery would be a serious upgrade. Too dangerous to donate to charity, these Pinzons were sheetcanned with an invigorating disgust."
1,Hurst products are made in China w/ short cuts taken,"The retaining ring is die cut from sheet stock that is flash plated prior to the cutting process. Clearly the ends will rust upon installation. Shame on Mr. Gasket, shame on B&M and shame on everybody else involved in turning a piece of Americana into a piece of junk. Buy these parts from Spectre (probably made in the same prehistoric factory). If you are going to get junk parts, you might as well pay junk price."
5,"Fits good, Easy Install......2005 Tahoe",I was looking for some visors that didn't use double sided tape to install.... and I found them. The front visors slide right into place and stay secure. The rear visors require a little more time and parts (supplied w/visors) but still an easy install and secure fit. These look great and let the fresh air in no matter what type of weather you're in. Very pleased!
2,Spotting Scope,It wasn't what I'd hoped for. Not a clear view at all. I contacted the vendor and they refunded my money right away.
2,"The beat is sort of fun, but......","At the same time, it is lyrically and musically angry and loud and bitter and bitchy. I just can't get into this song, it's almost scary. And don't even get me started on the video, she wasn't being herself, it was a stupid publicity stunt, either that or she was so painfully desperate to separate herself from the teen pop crowd she utterly disgusted them, literally shoving them away with an explosively nasty video. Oh, and in response to what Jagged Little Teenager said, the UK is known for enjoying really crappy music, so there you go."
1,Christina Gaguilera,"Ok.. Is she a pig or a singer? Make up our minds. What's up with the girl's wardrobe? I've seen rubberbands shorter than that skirt for this video. This video and CD is totally sleazy, and that ISNT a compliment! Christina should really do some self reflection. I remember her first CD, which was REALLY GOOD until she started pigging off.If Christina-- OR BRITNEY --would clean up their acts, and be ""good girls"" instead of nasty ones, I'm sure their fame and fanbase would sky rocket ten times higher than it ever will as they ""get dirrty"" on stage.CHRISTINA: if you ever see this remember the following:SOMETIMES LEAVING SOMETHING TO THE IMAGINATION IS A GOOD THING."
5,A Must Have for any Military Library,"The US-Mexican war is perhaps one of the most forgotten chapters in American Military History. While numerous books and documentaries have been written or produced about the conflict, the Mexican War escapes our collective popular memory, despite the fact that it is one of the most critical moments in our history. Dr. Winders has made a valuable contribution to the literature of that stuggle, by writing a book that focuses on the US forces engaged in the war. While there are several very good books that cover the battles, the politics, and the other ""big-picture"" aspects of the Mexican War, Dr. Winders' volume is one of the few books that examines the Army and the men that marched into Mexico. This book should be on the shelf of every military buff and is also a must read for anyone who wishes to examine the Mexican War seriously."
3,A little disappointment,"I thought this might be better then it was. If you were to rent it I think you would have liked it a little better did not pay for it, but just rented ."
1,"I kept waiting for the big battle, action - never happen! Boring!!","This movie was so slow and boring! For being at a critical location during the battle of the bulge, there was almost no fighting except a few shots here and there. There are so many better movies out there pertaining to this exact battle that has action and heart. The script was bland - and acting not that good...came across as a poor B movie with tight budget. You want to see a good war movie with heart, see saving Private Ryan - and the acting is great in that movie. Overall, poor movie - wish I could get money and time back."
5,An Excellent War Film,"Considering that it has a no name cast & no special effects to speak of. It none the less, delivers a fine perfomance that is well worth the popcorn. Just do not expect Ken Burns Civil War or saving Pvt. Ryan!"
2,WHAT A LETDOWN,"I'm really surprised at the numerous good reviews which this book received. Midnight Rain is such a letdown. The whole book was a drag as I just couldn't get into the flow of the story because of the author's concentration on repeating the thoughts of the heroine. She kept on repeating the same thoughts going thru' the heroine's mind that I was really sick of it. I literally had a huge headache from forcing myself to finish the book. This book lacked the humour & slickness which I found in ""Just Breathe"" & ""Dark of the Night"". It also lacked the tenderness in ""The Promise"". I really hope that she regains her flair in ""Dancing in the Dark""."
5,An intelligent thriller,Miss Davis just keeps getting better and better. Midnight Rain is the story of a man recovering from a personality-altering brain injury and his journey to redeem himself from his past. The questions in the book never stop. Who is the real threat? John or any one of several suspects in the book. The heroine is a kick-butt FBI agents who is not afraid of taking risks when she realizes that an innocent man is being set up.A book you don't want to start late at night unless you can sleep in the next morning....
5,Fan-freaking-tastic!,"I first heard this song in November, while listening to Heart 106.2 from London on my PC. Loved it the first time...still love it! This song has such a GA-ROOVY beat and really gets you moving. The video is really nice to watch...the dancing is great and the upbeat feeling is infectious. It's just too bad that most people in the US won't ever hear this song."
4,Canning lids,"I've not yet used the lids so I cannot rate their effectiveness. But I was sorry to see that the tops were not decorated as shown in the image. Instead there is ""crafted for quality, sealed for freshness"", at the top and a little scroll at the bottom....neither of which, especially the former, were expected. The lid top can, of course, be covered by fabric or paper, but that is an extra step I was hoping to avoid. Perhaps Ball will, in the future, change the writing to a script font, to match the scroll, so that the top of the lid would be more decorative.The lids are made in the USA, which is a bonus, and their web-address [http://www.freshpreserving.com/ has much information, including recipes and canning techniques] and toll-free [1-800-240-3340] phone number are listed on the box."
5,Fits Any Canning Jar,"This is unopened and appears to be in good condition. I cannot assess the product until i use it. So far, so good. Thanks"
3,Badger State,"This book covers the history of Wisconsin, the 30th U.S. state from the time it was a glacier to entering the modern era with the Green Bay Packers 3 Super Bowls and an NBA championship led by Kareem Abdul Jabbar. The Milwaukee Brewers went to a World Series in 81 or 82 and never went back. Held the once coveted position of nation's top milk producer but still leads in production of cheese. Covers segregated schools and desegregation, the freeing of slaves and WW1 and WW2. Overall, a good look at the badger state."
1,STOP!!!,"this is a bad gun i had one, and in 3 days the pistol broke,then 2 day later the stock broke on the shotgun. the same thing happend with my freinds."
4,An Extraordinary Achievement,"Not one of the truly great novels, no doubt (and there are so few), but outstanding and amazing, nonetheless. Recommended, despite philosophical musings of a gratuitous density and complexity -- at times, quite beyond full comprehension."
1,a disgrace to Abe,"I've loved most of the Abe that I've read, but this one was terrible. The ""philosophical musings"" mentioned by one reviewer are complete BS. The main character constantly reads deep philosophical meaning into things that are very straightforward. Don't waste your money on this--read The Woman in the Dunes or Kangaroo Notebook instead."
1,"Whining, with quotes from real books","This is neither an actual analysis of systems nor a humorous review, not that it does not try to be both. It is pretentious whining about why Things Don't Work, peppered with quotes from other authors (Lawrence Peter, Eric Berne, etc.), often out of their original context.The author smugly defines systems and their goals in terms that justifies his cynicism. He quotes no statistics or complete case studies, and uses endless anecdotal (and anonymous) ""events"" to support his simplistic condescension.In truth, most things are complicated and have no easy answers. The most important attribute of leadership, in my opinion, is the willingness to realize failure and try something else. This, unfortunately, requires patience on the part of stockholders and electorate, who seem to share Mr. Gall's impatient and intellectually lazy outlook."
1,maya user,"This book is not good. To set the tone of how it is written, I will give an example: Most books have little hints, tips and so on through out to stress important information, this book uses the words ""Don't go there!"" on every other page, taking up most of the book. This would be ok if I was like two and lived in the valley. The knowlage in the book is very very beginner and offered very little to no help. My suggestion, ""Don't go there"". haha."
1,Poor Quality!,"Do not even waste your money! You're better off bringing it in a large garbage bag! As we were putting the car seat in, the bag tore! They have large clear plastic bags for car seats at the airport when you check-in for free. Just use those!"
5,geocel caulk,"We have a log home and use lots of caulk to maintain the house. This product was recommended to us by our roofers as THE BEST. It seals very well, is flexible and comes out smoothly."
5,"Works like it should, conveniently retractable","Works as it should. What more could you ask for? Oh yeah, and it's practically free at $1.47. Anyone who buys a different cable is sort of a... *ehem*... sucker, says I."
3,Narrow and scrunch at the bottom,"These boots are not for women with large legs. If you have very tiny thighs then you will be ok. For anyone else, the shoe is too tight and rubs on your thigh. They are also very narrow, but seem to run a half a size bigger than they say."
3,Not too bad of a deal,"I recently got a juicebox from my parents for my b-day, and it is good. There are a few complaints.1. It only supports a 128 and 44 kbps bit rate. Its easy to simply download the right one, but its a hassle to redownload all your songs.2. Putting pictures on it is a pain. You cant just use windows explorer (which is what i like to do) like you can with the mp3s. I never thought that this was a big deal, but i know people might care.3. The memory card it comes with is WAY to small. 32 megs will let you put about 8 songs on there. I bough a big card though, so it works.Considering how cheap this is, it is definately a good deal."
5,BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I Just Got This Today and it is awsome I Got it at K-Mart 50% off for 10 dollors. Its Awsome Buy it!!!! All You WWE Fans you will like this to because it also has Rey Mistireo,Eugine,And Chris Benot. IT IS AWSOME!!!!!!! BUY IT NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!John Madigan"
2,NOT WORTH MY MONEY,"I picked this up for my kid brother's birthday...he was delighted with it until we realized that we had to buy another piece just to play mp3s and the stuff that it did come with you could hardly see or hear. He didn't really like any of the media that's available for it anyway, so after two days we took it back and got him a proper toy."
2,i got sucked in,"i bought these toys for my twin nephews (10) and I am close to losing my title of 'cool' uncle. The problem, they want a personal disc player. Plus, this toy does not have any of the content that they care about or that their friends think is cool"
3,"Good general overview, too much details on technology",The book seems to be written more from a bottom up approach and therefore misses in my opinion structured/fundamental insights for business models and business processes.
2,Useful content obscured by terrible writing,"There's a lot of meat here, but the poor writing and apparent absence of editing -- even minimal copy editing! -- make reading a chore and obscure what Amor has to say. Here's a direct quote (page 95, first sentence):""As we already have learnt, the increasingly sophistication Internet technology demands of web pages require more sophisticated.""The same week I bought this book, I also bought Philip & Alex's Guide to Web Publishing, by Philip Greenspun. Greenspun's book was so compelling that I could hardly put it down. After a few sessions slogging through Amor's book, I dreaded picking it up again."
4,Great Book,"I started just recently with E-Business and was surprised to find a book written in 1999 that contained all the relevant tipps and hints that are required in 2001 to conduct successfully e-business. If you look at the recent dot.com shakeout and the reasons for it, it seems that these people have not read the book, although it was available at that time. A very interesting book that is still up-to-date. Some technologies and business cases could be expanded, but for starters, this is the right book and even experienced e-business people will find some interesting facts in here. Why didn't I give 5 stars? Because it was too much to read. Sometimes it is difficult to find the right information."
4,AOLicizing the 800 lb Gorilla,"Although thick, I enjoyed this book. Let me tell you... I went through 3 highlighters just marking passages relevent to paradigms relevent to my own best practices. A verbal storyboard for this book? Try thinking outside this box: How the 800 lb gorilla AOL-icized America from 30,000 feet!"
1,Bad. Very Bad. Horrifically Bad. Bad Bad Bad,"I have seen horror movies of all kind, some I have enjoyed, some are really just horrific. This is the worst horror movie I have ever seen in all my entire life. And there have been quite a few. The acting is bad. The gore effects are bad. The very storyline itself is beyond bad. Editing is even bad. The people that created this monster of a movie just didn't know what they were doing. I just dont know how to corelate words to convey the horror that is this film. I think going to the dentist would be a better time spent than rewatching this really bad movie. What ever you do. Do not watch the movie. Do not own the movie. Do not rent the movie. Please. For your own sake. Sleepaway Camp is a Shakespeare production in comparison to this movie."
5,Added knowledge!,"It's good that I've had the priviledge to sit down and watch a real engineer mix great music, but then again, it would really help anyone who've read this book to achieve great mixes even in their own bedrooms. Lucky that I actually understood most of the jargons they mentioned, only means that this book is not for the entry levels looking for basic stuff... (not that I'm a pro or something.) There are unending 'trial and errors' by doing it yourself, and with this handbook the added knowledge cannot compete with just plain 'ol experimentation. Powerful insights and straightforward interviews were great. I give it a 5 out of 5."
4,Tiffany's sophomore effort is mediocre,"Tiffany Renee Darwich's sophomore effort is mediocre compared to her 1987 self-titled debut. ALL THIS TIME is the only Top 10 hit from this set,released in fall 1988. Darwich was still relentlessly receiving fanletters and appearing in teen-oriented publications such as 16,Bop and Teen Beat. However,in 1987 and '88,MCA was distributing many hit records recorded by Darwich's labelmates Bobby Brown,Elton John,The Jets,New Edition and others."
1,Way Over my head !,"This book is useless to those who dont understand algebra. I tried to learn some of the concepts just by reading and found myself nodding out. What irritated me the most was the author was ""kind"" enough to offer to sell you an excel spreadsheet program to figure out all his calculations...........at $195.00 each commodity! And another $29.00 for the historical data. Seems like an infomercial to me. I mean if you cant use the book by itself, why not just sell it as a course with everything included. Not to say his methods do not work but it just turned my off. I am currently working on several trading methodolgies requiring programming knowldge and if anyone can help me with this, we can bypass all this other stuff. Contact me at:mince38 @ yahoo.com I al also putting together a global think tank of trading ideas of cutting edge thinkers all over the world.Marc"
2,I had hoped for more,"I read reviews about this book, and thought that it would give me a chance to try to understand. I live in Los Angeles, and all I knew were news reports.The concept of chapters as ""minutes"" was interesting.Before I continue, I must tell you that I did not read all the chapters, I sometimes skimmed here and there. To be quite honest, the book did not work for me. There were a few chapters that touched me, but most of the book felt cold.Perhaps I would read it differently a few years from now.My final comment, the author is French, he has a different perspective. Do not discount this book just because I am American. Perhaps it is too soon for me to read it. Or, perhaps, he does not understand, himself, enough to write about this. I do not know....time will tell.Charlie_in_LA"
4,good collection,"Hill Stations are an interesting topic of colianialsm in Asia. Hill Stations are interesting because it is where westerners tried to maintain their lifestyles in Asia and taking in Asian populations in the schools. Also, the differences in different colonies is interesting to see. In places like South Asia, Hill Stations you saw a mix of them because they had Westen missionaries and Western traders while in the Phillipeans you saw the only American Hill stations and they were mainly missionaries."
3,not that bezerk over wazbones.,"A band that was on it's way up when it came to climing the hairspray-metal charts way back in the late 80's. Their best album was and still is.........BEZERK!.... As for this Wazbones cd it is not bad.Harder then the first two cd's ok,but not something I was crazy about after hearing what they came out with on BEZERK!Hair-metal isn't only about the amount of hairspray a band puts on,it has a special kind of sound and that sounds isn't on the Wazbones cd. My opinion is,if you are not a 100% Tigertailz fan and just like to find out what this band has to offer....find BEZERK...........as the noise level on that cd is critical!Did I mention they aslo have a live cd out called ""You Looking At me?""."
2,Surprised,"I picked up this book on a whim, without having read any of the previous books. It's a typical classic fantasy, with grandiose, stilted sentence structure, lots of thees and thous, and backwards-running sentences. Protagonist gets magical thingamabob and has to return it to its rightful place, joins up with stalwart traveling companions along the way, and so on.I was surprised, however, by how violent and gory this book really was. Definitely not for smaller kids. Characters go to their deaths screaming, characters get skinned, eaten, ripped apart, blood showers down, decapitated heads show up on more than one occasion. This is perhaps the most violent kid's book I've ever encountered, and I don't typically have a problem with violence. And after all of that, it ends tragically.The stilted language keeps you at a slight distance from the characters, so you don't really care that much about their fates. But still ... the book was dark, bloody, and ultimately pretty depressing."
5,WOW!,"I don't have a large DVD collection, but I had to purchase this movie. I was fortunate enough to go to a screening, which was packed. This story is so original, and had everything that I look for: entertainment, characters that are interesting and that one empathizes with, humor, and some romance. I think many people will relate to many of the characters in the movie. The movie is also very well edited and shot. It's very professional for an indie movie. I give it 5 stars!"
1,not for me,"When I ordered this movie I expected a thrill and excitement. It's none of those. The actress has a beautiful face and body, but that's all she can bring to the movie. She can't even walk sexy when she has lingerie on. I know she's not trying to be sexy because sex isn't what she was hired for. But she didn't have to walk like a tom boy. I just think with that body she can move better.I also think she is boring to watch for so long. She can't smile for anything. I know she is trying to let you know she is unhappy with life. But why didn't she smile when she got the job with the real estate guy. That was something she wanted to do. He was happy to give her the job. Talking about all of the money they will be making. But she couldn't even crack a little smile. She is SO boring to watch.The only thing I liked about her is how caring she is. She cared and worried about the one's around her."
5,One initial Leap of Faith,"An airplane crash in the desert - and before the time of GPS and satellite communication. A motley crew of assorted passengers, with an imaginative mix of personalities, goals and motivations. They play against - and with - each other very realistically, and the ending is never a sure thing; the style was past the point when every story must have a happy ending.One initial happenstance requires a bit of a leap of faith - they crash within walking distance (sight) of a water source. But, after all, you can't kill all the characters right out of the starting gate. So - get by that; the rest is a great ride!"
3,"Cheap, but it works.",I find a comb with smaller (but more) bristles works better then this. Its a cheap plastic. It will still work if you dont want to spend alot on a good comb.
3,Teasing comb,Not really what I expecting it really does tease very well. Nothing like the metal ones they no longer make.
4,Cop Silver tracks man eating alien in hilarious spoof.,"Eat and Run is a rare gem. Only the most underground video stores carry stuff like this; not that its deviant, just that its such a small time flick. But if you're into Naked Gun/Airplane type humor then this is for you. Ron Silver plays a veteran cop with one bizarre twist: his inner monologue isn't inner. In other words, he talks to himself, as if reading narration from a story. Its his job to find out why citizens are disappearing, leaving nothing but a few buttons behind. This turns out to be the work of a stranded alien (who looks like a reject from ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"") with an insatiable appitite. Sound silly? It is. But with the addition of characters like Ron's father, the abusive police chief, and the ""fried wristwatch"" boy, Eat and Run enters the company of films like Austin Powers... the more you watch them, the better they get."
3,Cobra XRS-9330 12-Band Radar,"it is good, but the detecting range is very limited. I expected more... but for the XRS 9300, the money is worth it."
1,saudi,I bought this product more than a week ago have not received anything so farI have asked for 9 parts and has not been reached
2,Received different looking earbuds,"I hate earbuds that I have to put inside my ears. They're never comfortable so I was pleased to finally find these after a long search. But when I got them, they didn't look anything like the picture and they're exactly what I didn't want.Although, I have to admit they look much better than the cheap looking earbuds in original picture. If you like the type that you shove into your ear drum then you might like these. Guess it's back to searching for me."
2,Better options available,"My daughter received this last Christmas, and has used it very few times since. The picture is small and difficult to see, we've had a hard time getting the cartridges to work, and it eats batteries like crazy. It is especially bad in the car, where we thought she'd use it the most. Much better choice is the VideoNow player, which my son has. Easier to see, batteries last longer, and the DVD format is much more user friendly. Better yet is the Pixter, by far the best and most played with toy she has. Much more educational, durable, versatile, and entertaining. My son is getting his own Pixter this Christmas, so they can both be happy on long car rides and at home!"
2,Kinda Good,"This is good but the videos are kinda bad. The music and pictures are good, but the music has very little storage. This is a 2 star toy. If you bought this you are a bit**. I'm kidding. I would give this a 2 1/2 stars."
1,Hidden Story of Cancer Review,"I probably will not finish the book. The author writes like my sons in high school when given a 1000 work essay...lots of repeating, not a lot of meat. Looks to me like he thinks he is being paid by the word for this material. His premise that we can have some control over cancer by controlling our diet is appealing. I wish he would drop all of the negative reviews of other studies in this field and present his own material without so much opinion."
5,Lost classic...in print for the first time in sixty years!,"This is a whimsical little book which finds the creator of Sherlock Holmes musing on his life long love of reading. Odds are good that if you have found this listing in your internet travels you are also a person who loves books. If so, buy this title while you are lucky enough to be able to lay your hands on it. It took me ten years to find a copy! This paperback is a very nice edition with the complete text intact. What you will get for your money is the warmest little book about books that you have ever read...and experience that feels like an intimate conversation with Doyle as he takes you through a tour of his personal library. Its more like reading a letter than an essay. I know I've acquired some new books on Sir Arthur's recommendations and you probably will too. Don't hesitate...its worth every cent and you may never find an affordable copy again. Happy reading friends!"
4,"...about ""You Make the Whole World Cry""...","I just wanted to write a review of this CD because of the song ""You make the whole world cry"". Tanita's first album was a big hit in the late 80's, but then her second album felt a bit dissapointing, making one fear that she is one of those artists that say all they have to say on their first album and little after that. But then came 1992 (around her third lp) and the song ""You make the whole world cry"". It is gorgeous. Its an epic song, and the productio and arrangements are grandiose to match it. It feels like one of thos italian pop songs of the early 70s with huge orhcestra's or one of those Phill Spector producctions or something fit of Rafael trabucchelli or Jean Bouchety. Except it has an urgency to its performance and music. Not too many people know that song. Even I found it just browsing through the discount bins. So thats why I felt obliged to write this review so you know there is such a jewel out there. And she wrote and produced it herself."
1,poor recording,the music is horrible. you cant hear what he or anyone is saying in the first half of the video. they have this creepy background music going on.the content itself is ok. just some scattered this and that.
3,this works,I feel more like my o ld self since taking this I just ordered my 3rd bottle and I feel a big difference. I have my confidence back. Thank you
3,"if you ever wished smog had a girl vocalist,","this album is for you. I found it pretty boring at times, but I'm not a great Smog fan either. I don't know if the comparison to Lisa Germano is really fair - Germano is much more melody- and texture-driven, whereas Dall's music is extremely spare. What they have in common is a calculated ghostly creepiness. Jim O'Rourke and Bill Callahan (Smog) back Dall up on this. Oh, and the cover really is utterly gorgeous, esp. on vinyl."
4,Your domestic animal could be dangerous too!,"Think those wild animals are the only dangerous things out there? Check out your cat. That's right, your own cat! I escaped serious injury when my cat turned on me, for no reason at all! All I did was rub it hard and fast, making noises like ""Woowoowoowoo, Blllllll, tiziziziziz"" then tried to flip it on it's back. Then it made growling noises at me. Then I asked it, ""What are you going to do? Cute me to death?"" Then I blew into its face, grabbed its tail and tried to crank it like a car! After rubbing its stomach furiously, the animal tried to take a swing at me with claws outstreched! It missed, but the injury it could have caused... Sometimes animals will attack for no apparent reason, like my cat did. So be wary. You may be harbouring a potentially dangerous animal in your very own home!"
5,BEST TKK ALBUM EVER!!!,"if you love the cult and you don't own this disc you are SERIOUSLY MISSING OUT.my favorite album used to be 13 above the night.(primarily because it mixed up all of their styles on one disc)anyway,the reincarnation of luna, pretty much takes 13 above the night, throws it on the ground, and urinates on it.GET THIS ALBUM NOW!!!"
3,"Lots of fun, but lightweight material","This sling shot is a lot of fun, but the handles tore after a few uses."
3,Original Sound Track?,"Update: I just found out there are two anime's from japan based on this same story. This is for the 2nd one that came out and is also the one that was released on DVD in the US. So make sure this is the version of the sound track you really want.The sound track is a nice mix of short instrumental pieces that are well written and played well. The singing on the intro and closing credits songs is cute and very enjoyable.Over all this CD is ok, but I purchased it thinking I was getting the OST to the 1st Maid Team series. So for mei it was a bit of a let down and might have effected the score I gave it."
5,Centennial is awsome,"I thought this movie just brought you into the story .You felt like you were a part of the whole movie. Each character was so real..this all star cast of actors and actress were wonderful.I was glued to the tv set every time it was aired on TV . I could watch this time and time again. IT is very educational too, what real settlers had to go thru good and bad.It was justamazing how well the story line moves along.I think everyone should see it at least once ( if not more)."
2,Review of the DVDs,"I won't go on about the series itself here since that's already been done. I, like many, ordered this DVD set and after trying to watch it found that the transfer is so bad my DVD player won't even play many of the DVDs due to errors on the discs. The quality of the DVDs is pretty bad if my high end DVD player won't even play them or just ejects them. Whoever is doing quality control for the company producing these discs is doing a poor job.Ordered a replacement today. Hopefully it's better and I just got a bad batch of discs. Will write more after seeing the replacements.EDIT: After the second set came, the discs were fine. As a series 5 star - but as a product, anything I have to reorder due to bad product is midrange-poor."
4,DVD,"Centennial is finally on DVD, and we have loved re-watching this beautiful story about Colorado and the old West. I remember watching this mini-series on TV long ago. The series is based on the James A. Michener book by the same title."
5,The best commentary on the West and how it was settled!,"It is amazing that Richard Chamberlin is regarded as the ""king of the mini-series"" but when his credits are listed, ""Centennial"" is never mentioned. Yet, it is the BEST of all mini (maxi)-series. Michener is superb in the way he picks one locale and traces it through American history. Also superb, is the cast, though the characters are fictitious, they make them real and believeable! The director did an outstanding job of keeping the storyline intact. I read ""Centennial"" as I watched the series and the script was almost verbatem! I have attempted, on more than one occasion, to tape this entire series, with minimal, if not professional, success. So, my only alternative is to order the entire series from Amazon.com!!! Will Rogers (WRogers@cybertime.net)."
5,Centennial: The Complete Series,Centennial Miniseries is excellent! I bought my copy so the my neices and nephews could see it!
1,Don't waste your money,"After watching the first disc of the series I could not beleive that money was spent to tell this story. While the story itself would have been interesting as well as educational, the writing was absolutely terrible and that of a beginner, the adaptation from the book for TV was awful, and direction left more than enough to be desired. If the book by Wilder was anything like its protrayed on the screen I'm glad I haven't read any of Wilders other books if he's written any. I can't beleive I paid money for this series. I've seen better writing to tell a story from a middle school student than what was written for the screen here. It's a shame also because this story of Colorado could have been very educational if it had the proper mechanics to tell it."
5,centennial,this is an awesome mini series full of an all star cast. I think it is full of history and great scenery.
4,Something Missing,"I remember watching this mini-series on television when it was first aired and decided to rush out and buy the book by Michener which I immediately goobled up. A great and book and a great program, which does justice to the long novel. They don't make them like that any longer, as the age of teh great miniseries has gone.One problem with the set as i would have given it 5 stars, it advertises on the box ""Bonus Features"", a retropspective look, but it's not part of the six DVD set, has anyone else noticed it, is there something wrong with this, I wouls love to see the interviews etc."
3,Problematical,"I like Dimitri Kitaenko very much. He was one of the conductors on Sheffield Labs's ""The Moscow Sessions"" project back in the 1980's. The recordings on this CD date from that time, and therein lies the problem. What seems to be an exciting, well played version of the symphony is hampered by a late analog recording that is extremely multi-miked. Strings sound almost as if in another room from the up close winds, and the dynamic range isn't that great. The Rock was recorded two years earlier, and here the recorded sound is natural. It's a splendid performance, ideally captured. My favorite recording of the symphony is Leonard Slatkin's on an Excelsior CD from Sam Goody's. I believe it's currently available on Vox, in a different remastering. I wouldn't dissuade anyone interested in Kitaenko from trying his recording, but you have to put up with a lot to enjoy it."
2,bad translation,"I bought this for a course on German Fairy Tales. Several people in the class had this edition, although it was not the one specified by the professor.The professor was continually surprised by the poor quality of the translation (he is a native german speaker and studies these stories).As just one example, Rapunzel is named after the variety of lettuce that her parents stole. For some reason this book decided to translate that plant into ""radishes"" without changing her name.There are other stories too, that are just... missing something.The stories are great, but you can find better translations of them (even for free online). Don't buy this edition."
4,Undiscovered Genius,"The Bathers (from Scotland ) are one of the greatest undiscovered bands of this or any other era .If you like dark , moody songs of love , passion and longing then this is the disc for you .Chris Thomsons singing may be an acquired taste but the songs are fantastic and the music lovelorn and sublime , i love this band !!!"
2,Did I Just Listen To An Album??,"Don't get me wrong folks, I absolutely love thrash. However, I guess I think thrash should be more than repetitive, boring riffs that seem patched together randomly without any sense of grandeur or purpose beyond pretending to be angry. As a result I must say that I think this is a pretty poor album. I've listened to it several times through, and it's over before I know it, not only because of the scant material, but because it just sounds like a big wall of boring noise. Absolutely nothing stood out to me. Maybe I've just reached a point where I need more out of my thrash than this gives, but frankly I really think it just is not a good album. Maybe their newer material is better...see for yourself I guess."
4,FUNNY AND WITTY,I absolutely loved reading Wonderful. I found Lady Clio and Merrick as two different people bought together and really learned alot from each other. Merrick is very (yummy) and Lady Clio (beautiful) and together hilarious. A must read .
4,"Lovely story, Historical Romance","-Read on Kindle-I really enjoyed this one. It is actually the first of three stories with overlapping characters. I broke down and bought the second two books today.In this book, a young girl is betrothed to a knight and while he's away at war she is left at a convent. He takes two years longer than he intended and she sits waiting for 6 years.When they meet again, they both like each other, but she is mad at being left for so long and is naive and a bit immature from living in a convent. Her character develops throughout the book and she learns and grows and becomes a person you can identify with. Her husband-to-be realizes that there is more to women then just doing what they're told and he learns how to handle her personality and enjoy her quirks.Worth the $2 price tag, could have used one more time editing I think, just a little rough in places. I really enjoyed it, just not QUITE a 5-star.Not PG, adult romance novel."
4,A Fine Old Western!,"John Wayne and his cast of selected top stars make this movie oneof the great Westerns in our collection. However...I was disappointed atthe editing job on this film. The characters move (or don't move) likerobots, every place there was any editing done.ANNA MARIE FRITZ [...]"
5,Great Movie,"This was John Wayne's last movie, my husband and I never tire of a good western, we enjoyed this one from beginning to end and think anyone would."
2,"No offense Duke, but this thing was pretty bad","No offense to the Duke--he was actually about the only good thing in this movie. The dialogue was more like a stage play--very stilted and unrealistic. Harry Morgan's Marshall character was an over the top joke.The timeline was a joke too--it takes place over 5 days, and by day 3, everyone is completely attached to the Duke's character.The blood in the gunfight scenes looked like melted pink taffy--it was awful.I don't know why everyone gave this 5 stars--sentimentality for John Wayne I suppose, which I can understand. But it doesn't excuse the terrible screenplay, bad acting, or lousy effects."
3,"Not my favorite Deliverance album, but still a good release","Ever since I first heard them on California Metal way back when, I was hooked on this band. Like Camelot In Smithereens, it's more in the melodic progressive metal vein. This band has certainly proved they got the ability to live through what ever passing eras & trends in metal. However, I still prefer their earlier albums. Learn is one of their better ones."
4,Pretty neurotic stuff,"Okay, we're all insecure and thus can identify with this author. Of course, this makes her character very likable and her life engrossing. Still, I worry about any woman who gets her hands on this book and misses the sarcasm and humor intended."
4,Holy price increase!,"We've been using this dish soap for the past two years, and love its simple formula and effectiveness. However, the last time I ordered a case, it was thirty three dollars and fifty one cents. Even with the Subscribe & Save, today's price is over forty seven dollars! That's over a dollar more per bottle! I think I'll be considering other options this time around."
2,BAAAAAAD!!!!,"Not informative,Not interesting,It's not even good enough to be called Sleazy.Absolute JUNK!Certainly not a documentary."
4,Looks as advertised,"I bemoaned losing a malachite ring over 15 years ago. After looking in Scottsdale Arizona, this online item was the nicest I found. The ring is attractive and big, which can sometimes become a problem when sticking your hand in your jeans pockets. No problem with the stone falling out yet (after 3 months)."
1,Sneaky Tactics,"In searching for an Eddy Arnold DVD for a gift, I find one listed here on Amazon. I went through the usual buy now instructions when a screen pops up showing a second available DVD. Buy both for $xxx. Thinking it was a totally differeny DVD, I bought the two of them. Both DVD's are the same.No song playlist was available to prevent me from ordering the both. Naturally I'm short one Christmas gift and proceding with returning the duplicate DVD. Buyer beware. Amazone..... shame on you!"
2,EDDY ARNOLD SINGS THE HITS,THE DVD WAS TO SHORT WISH IT BEEN MORE UP TO DATE. HIS INTERVIEW WAS INTERESTING AND HE SEEMED VERY KIND. THAT INTERVIEW WAS MY FAVORED OF THE DVD.
1,One of the worst books I've read,"This could have been a great book, but instead it does nothing. The author assumes that all bosses are jerks, incompetents, or bullies. No exceptions. It also has insightful gems such as ""the only place to do business in California is LA"" (hello? ever heard of Silicon Valley?""). The book is mean spirited (absolutely nothing positive to say about corporations or the people who work there), full of pathetic attempts at humor, and there is almost nothing usefull for understanding group dynamics in an office, which would really be usefull information. Stay away from this book."
4,Wonderful help,"Although this book doesn't have as many recipes as I'd like, it is full of techniques that enable you to utilize all the recipes you have. The full color pictures that go along with every technique were beautiful. I would have given this 5 stars except that there could be a little more explanation for the techniques in the back of the book. Overall, this is fast becoming my go-to book for creating spectacular desserts"
1,Do Not Buy,"The book is filled with great pictures, but the techniques are poorly described, and sometimes are not described at all. I've tried several recipes and all of them have been missing steps that the book assumes you already know. My sponge cake for example could have been used for a spare tire, not sure what happened there! I've used some of the ideas in the book, but have gone to other cookbooks for the actual recipes! This book was not worth the money."
4,Good product !,Works well. Simple. Reasonable price. Easy to use. Thank you Amazon for offering me this product at such a fair price. Arrived on time in perfect condition.
3,entertaining but not at his top,"I found it a bit boring at times, so far the one I liked the most was sky coyote,I still have to read tons of them though, I like the idea at the base of the whole series anyway,and the irony sometimes surreal is really enjoyable"
4,Nice 80's rock/pop,"Quite some time before Roxette this is Per's first attempt to land a hit internationally. It did not work, but that is not really to blame on the album. Heartland Cafe is really nice, well-produced '80 pop/rock and overall a good LP.However, the quality of the work is not consistent: Some songs are more than annoying (uncreative music, boring standard lyrics, very mediocre vocals, pseudo. Let's just mention ""Young Girl"", ""When love's on the phone"", ""Mr. Twilight"") whereas other songs really stand out as one of the more interesting and finer songs to hit the radio in the '80s (""Demon Emptyness"", ""Dreaming"", ""Another Place, Another Time""). And the title song has what it takes to become a classic - it was just never given a fair chance. If you skip a few songs (thanks to programmable CD-players ;-) ) you get an underrated, interesting and pleasant '80s album. Not more, not less."
1,cheaply made,I purchased this for my nephew's 11th birthday last week and he already called to tell me that the little door broke off of it.His mom (my sis-in-law) said that she already forked out 40 bucks to get the MP3 kit... and then the thing breaks.I'm very disappointed with this product. I wanted to get something fun for my nephew and he ended up with this piece of junk. There's always a second chance at Christmas...
1,THIs really isnt that great,"I know it sounds really kewl, they say that it has pictures and music and tv shows but i got one and all it can play is tv. And the tv it plays is all junky shows all they have is Cartoon Network. No NIck no live shows just some sports stuff. Also, it doesn't play music or picts... you have to fork over 40 bucks. Also I read the review who was talkin bout the one they have in Toys R Us. I looked at that one too and bought 1... then when I got home the sound was worse and the quality was worse. I brought it back to the store and i could tell that the sound was better and the picture is better at Toys R us. they give better ones to the stores. DON'T BE FOOLED BY THE SAMPLES"
5,WOW!!!,"Hi everyone,this is a review for the new jucie box made by mattel, this is great for anyone ages 8-12 but also good for those adults who like childens gadgets! overall this is great and I thnk that anyone into playing media of almost any type whilst on the move should get one!!!"
1,what a disappointment,I saw a TV ad and it looked neat. i found it my store in az. the picture is terrible. i returned it.
5,A Good Piece of Hardware,"This is a very nice piece of hardware for the price, it costs less then video Now and is also a lot smaller. It plays on video cartridges rather then cd's and the graphics are pretty good. My only complaint is the speed required to play the sport videos, It was crazy for them to think this small little machine can play something that fast. Overall, it is worth the money and I recmonned buying it."
3,Warning: Its just a toy,"If you are going to buy this and the buy the mp3 add on kit be warned that it can only play very limited quality songs, the pictures look like crap, and the songs you us have to be in stereo. I guess this thing is only a toy for watching their over priced movies but if the main thing you want it for is to listen to mp3's I recomend you just buy a mp3 player the picture viewing is just a useless bonus."
5,Just seen 'em live!,"This is one of the most promising bands I've heard in a long time. They are opening for The Who and I've already seen them in Holmdel, NJ and Nissan Pavilion, VA. And I'm off to see them again tomorrow in Camden, NJ. I liken them to Creed. I'm not all that comfortable with the religious undertones, but I can live with that considering the talent and potential. BTW, The Who is pretty good, too . . ."
2,"Some interesting ideas, but very slow","Some heavy concepts are presented in Afterschool. It accurately portrays what boarding school and high school in general can be like. However, the movie could have been about 45 minutes shorter and could have delved much deeper into how students and administrators deal with personal development, isolation and tragedy."
2,disappointing at best,"Most people have remarked how this film is either a love it or hate it movie, but I can't say that I fall into either category. I didn't hate it, but I didn't like it at all either. I found the camerawork shaky and the reasoning behind cutting off some scenes absurd. The highlight of the entire film for me was when the protagonist created his own video - the few minutes he created were sad and powerful and poignant. The rest of the film is just garbled. So it goes."
1,Cheap made in China crap,I used this gauge for a week and the brass screw stripped out making it useless. Don't waste your money on this made in China crap. I wasted 15 dollars after shipping.
1,Waste of money,"This thing doesn't work at all. The marker is not secure, and comes unscrewed when the gauge is used."
2,Wheel marking gauge,I bought this item in the hope that it will make marking wood easier but it did not. I am not an experianced carpenter but entheosiastic DIY person. I tried this item more than once and I had to use both hands to set the guage and then it did not slid on the wood smoothely.This item may stay on the shelve for some time before I try to use it again.
1,Too much information for an 11 year old girl...,"I purchased this book for my daughter who is 11 and will be 12 soon. I decided it would be best to read through the book before reading it with her and I'm glad that I did. I live in a suburban community and try to protect my children from learning too much too soon. I don't believe that 9-12 year old children need to know the details about anal sex, oral sex, masturbation, and the many other topics included in this book. This book would be best for a high school age girl. Far too much information for a pre-teen to absorb or fully understand."
5,Perfect for travel!,"I tried this when I was visiting my sister-in-law. She had been using Dr. Dennis Gross products for a while and let me try the travel packets. I was hooked! My skin immediately looked better and didn't react at all to the ingredients. I use these for travel only; I use the ""jar"" version at home. I am always getting complimented on my skin (something that didn't happen when I was younger). I give the credit to this product in combination with a prescribed Renova-type product that I use at night (the Alpha Beta peel use only in the morning). I have tried other expensive and inexpensive products, but this brand works beautifully for me, for many year now."
4,Review of Ferre's Language Duel,"I emphasize first my one criticism of this work: its name implies that it is a ""dual-language"" work, designed as a side-by-side translation with English and Spanish. This is true in some sense, but the translations are done loosely to maintain poetic splendor.Moderate- to advanced-level Spanish speakers, as well as English lovers of poetry, will certainly appreciate these wonderful poems. Rosario Ferre's talent as a poet should go unchallenged; her metaphors and imagery speak strongly to her talent as an artist.For those Spanish students brave enough to test the waters of reading Spanish with only a loose guide in English, this is an absolutely wonderful collection of poems, covering a variety of topics in cultura puertorriquena, ustadounidense y europa."
2,Wimpiest Piano Player,"The main character lacks any real vigor throughout the entire series. She may seem different to some viewers toward the end, but I did not feel that way at all. I feel the storyline was very boring and the little middle ""romantic"" situations were nothing too entertaining nor too graphic. Easily a G rated series for younger kids to watch. I do not think some older Elementary kids would enjoy this series nor older people unless they are really into Piano music. Without deriving meaning from the Piano music, you may as well kiss your interpretation of the series goodbye! I also did not like the ending because they didn't have her playing the song she created, which was not the ending credits music either."
3,Works great!,"This is a great kit for testing/adjusting ph of nutrient solutions. I have tried many other testers (test papers, strips, electric testers) and this is by far the easiest to use and the most accurate. I was prepared to pay several hundred dollars for nice electric tester but now I'm so glad I didn't...testers like those require constant calibration and various solutions...this kit requires nothing at all, so easy! The ph up and ph down are highly concentrated so go easy on them! You don't want to adjust your solution more than 1.0 ph a day or you could shock your plants!UPDATE: Ok the PH testing portion of this kit is great, HOWEVER, the ph DOWN solution is terrible. DO NOT USE IT. It is made from phosphoric acid which is bad because if you add it to a nutrient reservoir you will have massive amounts of slime growth within a day or two. Toss the PH DOWN and go get some pure sulfuric acid (battery acid sold at most automotive supply stores for very cheap)."
4,pH control kit,This product does exactley what it is suppossed to do. It measures pH and you balance it. Great for the price!
2,One good song,"I was disappointed with the album as a whole. When I heard the song ""Drink to Me Babe, Then"", I thought it was great and sounded like The Shins. The rest of the album was boring lyrically."
1,Disappointment,I was very disappointed. It was the first leapfrog I ever bought and it almost discouraged me from buying anything more from the company. It was boring and repetitive. Did not keep my son's interest at all.
1,Do not buy this toy,We received this toy as a gift and I wish we never had. We spent hours and hours trying to get the thing to work. We even bought a new DVD player trying to get it to work. Several calls to the help center only made us try longer to get the crazy thing to link to a DVD player. The call center gives you a ton of codes to try and each attempt takes some time. We finally got it to work on one of 5 DVD players in our house. It disconnects easily however and needs to be reset. The cursor to select the games also sometimes does not work.I would NOT recommend this toy. It is NOT user friendly.
1,Couldn't get it set up AT ALL!,"We got this for my 17 month little boy, and we absolutely could not get it to set up. We have a fairly new magnavox dvd player, and none of the codes worked AT ALL. So, we're stuck taking back yet another Christmas gift."
2,Not very happy with LeapFrog...,"I got this for my 1 yr old last christmas, it did take me forever to set it up we have a TV/DVD player and I had to use the extra codes to get it to work... My son didnt seem to grasp which button to push on the controller, we have EVERY DISC, I would point to it and then he would push it... I guess maybe thats what you should do... now he is 20 months and has no intrest in it at all... the controller is very durrible as my son has tossed it around his room... I wish they had Elmo in their disc's though... I should have gotten the v-smile for baby.. It is just frustrating when you spend the time and money and it doesnt seem to get you any where but a head ache... for parents, when your child does not push the right button or push it at all the voice will keep saying ""push a button"" again and again... quite annoying!!"
4,First system defective...,"After hours of trying to get the system setup, and contacting Leap Frog via e-mail, I finally caved and called. After being on hold for about 30 minutes, we came to the conclusion that the system I had originally purchased was defective. I kept getting a flashing green light and not a solid green light. I did get it to work, but it didn't last long. Was told to either mail it back to Leap Frog (which would take a month or so) or return it to where I bought it. After returning it, I had it up and running in two minutes. I have a Sony DVD player just over a year old and it worked right away on the the quick setup. So far everything seems great and my daughter loves it!"
1,Nearly Useless Overhyped System,"Let's be honest. This ""learning system"" consists of what amounts to an oversized remote control and a series of over-priced DVD titles that only work with said oversized remote control. The multi-step, amazingly counter-intuitive and unreliable setup procedure (at least one step of which you must activate EACH TIME the system is in use) drives the usability of the product down to nearly zero. The sample DVD which comes with the system only contains four activities which actually work with the remote, forcing owners to shell out $14 - $20 for each additional title. This ""learning system"" is essentially an elaborate marketing scheme. Beware."
1,DVD setup and customer service,"I could not set this unit up with my DVD player (Cyberhome). Tired all the codes and the response from Leapfrog customer service was to buy another DVD player. Yes, you read that right.Since I got this as a gift, I cannot return it."
1,Disappointed,"My daughter got this as a Christmas gift.... I was VERY disappointed. Yes, it was an easy set up, but I found the game VERY slow, it's too slow for my daughter of 20 months. She lost interest after a few minutes. This is basically a remote for you DVD player and it's slow response, my daugther didn't connect the pressing of a button with action on the game. She became frustrated because nothing would happen when she pressed a button. I'm reluctant to buy more games, I'm just returning it."
5,Great Stuff,At the begining i was hesitant to buy this product because some one said that it was difficult to connect to the tv but from the frist night we set it up it wored perfectly and so great that my brother wanted to take it every where he went but that of course could not happen!!!! but anyway it was very easy to setup and easy to swicth from baby to toddler
4,Modern Management Book,Good book for my college class. Gave alot of good information about management and helped me understand different types of management.
3,It's okay,I thought the lighing should be brighter. You have run the train wide open with no lights on to see a glow!
5,The deepest portrayal of the ancient (and modern) gnostics I've ever seen!,I thought this was a very well made documentary on who the Gnostics were in ancient times and who they are today. What I found most impressive though was learning about just what it is that they practice that gives them 'gnosis' or experience of a divine nature. This is something that other documentaries I've seen made with a more academic perspective have lacked. This inside perspective of the gnostics is something to be seen if anyone is searching for the authentic spiritual in this world of commercial gurus and blind beliefs.
1,Do not buy you will regret it!!,Amazon was great as usual first micro arrived damaged in shipping and they had a new one at my door the next day. Now for panasonic. My previous micro was a countertop Panasonic had it for years worked great. I used this microwave for about 6 months when something inside(wiring or sensor not food) caught on fire and smoke started pouring out the vent. We had it fixed under warranty. This microwave has a ventilating fan that kicks on automaticaly when internal parts get to hot.Very loud and annoying kicks on anytime you use the regular oven or stove top at the same time as micro. Doesn't seem right that they overheat that fast. The lights on range hood part only work when they want. I believe these micros have faulty wiring and shorts. The micro died yesterday after 1 1/2 years total use. of course warranty is up so while shopping for a new one I saw this was still for sale and decided to warn others.
1,No wonder Panasonic has discontinued this 4x lemon!,"Eight months after purchase it died overnight.After two weeks, it was back repaired. Then 2 months later it suddenly quit during a cook cycle. I was told I had faulty wiring etc.and Panasonic would fix it just one more time. However, just before the one year warranty expired, it stopped functioning for the third time.I had my wiring professionally checked and ran a $60 Emerson for two weeks without problems on that outlet to show Panasonic not my wiring, but their product was faulty. They agreed and gave me a new (later I found out it was remanufacutured) unit. End of story with a happy ending?NO, 5 months later, this unit quit also, that makes 4 defective OTR Panasonics units within 2 years.Now I have to install an over-the-range microwave for the FIFTH time and it will be any brand but...Panasonic."
1,Panasonic doesn't make good on it's warrentee,"We bought a Panasonic range top microwave in October which died the following July. The oven is covered under warrentee, but it requires us to bring it to the service center, the closest being a 2 hour drive from our home. That doesn't satisify me, and I don't think it would most people."
1,Mine has also died,"I bought this because it was a consumer reports best buy. From day one, on rare occasions it would make buzzing noises if I was cooking on the range and then turned on the microwave. I thought it didn't sound right but it was a new microwave, why worry. Well, after three years of use it just plain stopped working. I'm almost certain it's something with the wiring as others have indicated since it always sounded like something was shorting out. Too bad I wasted my money on this, should have spent a little more and bought a better brand."
2,Be careful of item sturdiness,Worked great until the play button broke. I learned too late that this is a common problem with this product. Time to find another MP3 player.
4,Good value for money,"No frills type player but does all the basics and represents good value for money. Bit of a learning curve getting up to speed with buttons and functionality but great batter life and simple PC interface, would recommend it"
4,Back-up Sensor.,I nstalled the sensor system on my Chevy Silverado and it still works great after three years. I was worried about water contamination but it turned out OK under the bed.
4,Interesting,There are some verses from the New Testament that I must say I really like the way Brother Knox has handled them. I have a Bible with maybe 26 different translation portions in it and it intrigued me how many times Knox was the one that Holy Spirit quickened to me.So I finally decided to cough up the coin and buy one. Being a Catholic Bible it has the apocrypha in it which is not Canon as it has errors. I also like the fact that it is a Bible in three books. Easier to read smaller volumes. Love ya and bye.
5,Subaru technician says this is a great product.,"When refilling cooling systems on subarus it is very easy to create air pockets if done incorrectly, with this tool it makes refilling subaru cooling systems a very simple job."
4,Excellent First CD with Excellent Vocals,"I am very impressed with Rusty's western style and excellent vocals. It is western and cowboy all the way and I am sure Chris Ledoux would be proud to see that he was Rusty's #1 music hero and greatest inspiration. I am proud to own this CD and I believe Rusty will be a huge success, I am looking forward to the next CD."
1,horrible!,"Oh my goodness! This CD is truly a dissappointment. I was so excited to get it and now that I have it, I hate it!The entire CD is a lullabye album. Boring. It seemed to have been written for his child. I should of just purchased Kenny Loggins lullabyes."
5,3rd album exceeds all expectations,"I teach Spanish and I am constantly searching for teachable music -- ie, hip and PG at the same time :). Juanes rarely disappoints. This new one is really great. The kids learned several off of Un Dia Normal and tomorrow we are learning Suenos. If I felt like explaining all the nuances of Camisa Negra, we may do that one. I love the sound of this album, and I like that some of the lyrics are social-political, a la Mana.It gives me a chance to talk about the situation in Colombia.I also really like Damelo, but I will have to edit some of it."
1,"Terrible CD, don't waste your money!","I rarelly write reviews, but I feel it's my duty to advise anyone who is thinking of buying this CD NOT to waste your money, it's awfull, I really liked ""nada valgo sin tu amor"" so I bought the CD, but it was a terrible mistake, I don't recommend it at all."
1,Que pena(what a shame) don't buy it/ no lo compren,"Dont' waste your money, seriously this album is so empty on epics and it doesn't even have average music. the best song is ""sueños"" only because of the lyrics but after that one there is no much good things to say."
4,Muy bueno,"Que es diferente, eso es lo magico de este CD, no soy fan pero son bellas las letras y la musica es fuera de serie...es divertido y vale la pena tenerlo...Para terminar le quiero decir a Israel J. Sustaita que me dio pena su mensaje, ahora mas que el productor del disco esta nominado al oscar por la musica de Brokeback mountain,por cierto esta persona se encargo de todo el disco y no sabe ni escibir ni leer musica ...todo de oido...Creo que tu carrera de critico aqui se acabo...."
2,Mediocre and over-produced,"I was able to listen to this whole album through a friend, and must comment that I have been a fan of Juanes ever since he was in the band EKHYMOSIS. His music back then, as well as in his last two albums, was excellent, quality work.I decided not to purchase this album because the songs sounded rushed, mediocre, and over-produced. Obviously he is selling lots of albums, but for those who have followed his musical career, it seems as though we agree this album is not good. It was actually a turn off for me to his music.I would suggest FIJATE BIEN or Ekhymosis albums instead of this one for anyone interested in Juanes, as well as unique, quality music. These productions hands down are way better."
2,Que Mal !,"Lastima por Juanes pero este Album no Va Alcanzar lo hecho con UN DIA NORMAL, Mi Sangre es muy Monotono y Repetitivo, pero que se hace."
5,The Complete Original Illustrated Sherlock Holmes,"I bought 2 copies of this book, one for my eleven year old great-grand daughter and the other for an elevenyear old grandson. They were both very pleased with the books and commented favorably on them."
5,Excellent compilation of Holmes stories!,"If you like mysteries and/or English authors, this is a must! The price is a bargain for so many wonderful stories."
1,DESERT RAIN,This book is all about touchy feely scenes and very little story. If you remove that part you would have a very poorly written story. Mind numbing time filler
1,Linc (the boy) is a total sexist butt,"Hate you because your beautiful.Run don't walk from this type of guyRead this book and witness ""love makes you stupid""Girl loves boy, boy lust girl, boy abuses girl, boy rapes girl, girls tolerates boy because he apologizes, boy demands she change, boy refuses to change, girl finally leaves after degrading herself, boy& girl live happily ever after. Linc (the boy) is a total sexist butt.Run the other way Holly.Worse romance ever except for Princess Di & Charles"
3,Nice gift set.,"I gave this to my husband when we found out we were expecting since he LOVES the Hawkeyes. He thought it was really cool! I think it is more for novelty than for use. The slippers are fine but the blanket is pretty cheesey feeling and looking. The yellow is also brighter, shinier and golder than how it looks in the picture and I don't care for the color personally. You can see it 10 miles away."
4,"We love it, but our daughter does not.","While my hubby and I think this is a perfectly charming and sweet stuffed animal, my almost 2 yr old daughter really wants nothing to do with it. She has had it for about 6 months and it has never captured her attention. It has a sweet ""retro"" look to it, which appealed to us. It is well constructed, and easy to wash (can go through the washer on delicate cycle w/o problem)."
2,Can't compete with Bloodrock Live,"I can't understand the many 5 star reviews - havn't you guys heard the Bloodrock Live album? The sparkle of this great Live album (at least 4 stars) is totally missing here. The passable ""Promises""and another one (I forgot) can't make up for the lousy rest."
4,Explaining food systems,"Beardsworth and Keil explains us how (in a sociological context) the food systems is created. First, making emphasis on human biological nourishment, continuing with the comparison and construction of traditional and modern food systems. After that, they points out the importance (in western mentality) of body, health and food and how this have been reflected in health, e.g. obesity, health movements and discourse."
4,Just as good as the more expensive cables,"Don't waste your money buying a Monster cable or even a Belkin cable. HDMI and DVI use digital signals to send the data from one end to the other. The data either gets there or it doesn't. If the cable doesn't work right, it is because one of the wires is broken or has a bad connection to the pin in the connector. Making sure the cable works properly is all about quality control. But it sure doesn't cost Monster an extra $80 to test the cable before they ship it out. So when you spend $99 for a Monster cable, you are just getting ripped off for a cable that costs them no more to make than this one."
1,Worst than I ever expected,"I love Maria Callas, but these recordings are so bad I could not listen without pain in my ears. These are the first CDs I have thrown away. They were completely unusable. They were not reamastered at all. What a cheating! DON""T WASTE YOUR MONEY! Buy Callas by EMI. You won't regret."
3,Not what they thought,"Bought this to make picture frames for a VBS project. Thought there would be several smaller sized moons in the packages, however, there were very few, so we ended up having to make our own. Took a lot more time than it should have if these had been the right size to begin with."
3,Rustic Bird House,The appearance and design is eye catching and cute. The little wood chimney decoration was loose and fell off due to the flimsy small bent nails that were used to attach it to the roof. I will have to glue it back on for it to stay. Recommend unwrapping the delivery package outside or over a waste basket as some of the loose moss decor falls off and is messy.
2,not for me,you need a lot of time and patience for this one (something I have neither of!) it's great for making pumpkin smoothies
3,pumpkin cutter,"it was alright, but i like the old fashion way. a knife and spoon and pumpkin guts to your elbows. overall it was money well spent."
5,Finally a DVD that's not embarassing for guys to use...,"I got this DVD from Amazon a few weeks ago and it's great. I made the decision based on an independant review I stubbled accross online. I must say, this DVD is pretty nice, even for guys. I broke quite the sweat on day 1! This is definately a work out. It also have a very easy to use interface. It's impossible to select the wrong workout. It's great that the workouts are done day by day. You just choose what day it is and start!! Great!!"
3,Decent but not great,"This is probably the worst of the Lamaze Toys that I have purchased (granted that I think Lamaze Toys are better than just about any other baby toys). The worm is difficult for my son to grab onto and it doesn't really do that much. The single musical thing is rather quiet. Like the other poster, my son prefers Pupsqueak to this toy. He also likes his Buzz Bug much more than this toy. Inchworm isn't awful and has kept his attention but we've gotten a lot more mileage out of the other Lamaze toys. I'd got with Pupsqueak or Buzz instead."
4,"Wouldn't call it ""musical""","Ok, so it does play a little 10 second ditty, but that's about it. I mean, it's a great toy other than that with crinkly bits, a squeaker, a rattle, and different colors and textures, but to advertise it as being musical is sort of misleading. My 4 month old does enjoy it though and the little feet on it are perfect for chewing. As far as I'm concerned, another great Lamaze toy. Only gave it 4 stars because of the ""musical"" aspect. As a side note, I only paid around 10 bucks for it and don't necessarily think it's worth a lot more than that. BUT, as I said, great toy."
1,Not worth the money.,To call it musical is a stretch. The music is extremely quite and not exciting. The worm itself is nice and vibrant but the description and picture make the worm seem a lot bigger than it really is. We have purchased a few other Lamaze items and have loved all of them but not impressed with this item at all. I ended up returning it to purchase a real musical toy.
4,Chunky cat food,"This is not grain free, but doesn't have any by-products. It's very chunky and smells fine. I don't think it's top of the line food, but it's a step up from the ones you buy at the grocery store, and the price is OK(I buy at my local pet store)."
5,great stuff,"i really like this stuff.. it has a fresh clean scent and it does what it says.. removes all odors.. i even had a chance to use it on something heavy when i accidently dumped pancake syrup on my bed!! i was so frustrated until i used the natures miracle on it.. it came right off, no stickiness or anything.. and also takes away urine odors from cages, toilets and lots of other things!"
4,Very complete but with rough spots.,"This is a somewhat disorganized, but very good beginners volume. Suffers from inconsistent provision of star and constellation pronunciations in last few months, occasional lapses of continuity between dated text and figures, lots of repetition - the latter not all bad for beginners. Cygnus figures far overdone in quantity - appeared on 14 of the 17 pages for August . October month section contains outstanding explanation and illustrations of celestial sphere and stellar movements with respect to observers location, and extremely useful and lucid graphic and textual explanation of RA, declination, azimuth and elevation relationships. Best I have seen in other volumes, mostly of much higher price. Got the impression Ramo got tired of the project along about September when things started going a bit downhill on pronunciations and content. Altogether a good buy for beginners."
1,Samsung LN 52A650 and PS3 don't like this cable...,"Bought two of these cables to connect my Motorola (Comcast) cable box and my PS3 to my Samsung LN-52A650. Worked well for the cable box (1080i), and the PS3 @ 1080i, but I got the dreaded ""Mode Not Supported"" message from the Samsung when the PS3 sent a 1080p signal. After a Samsung firmware update, the Samsung still wouldn't ""See"" the PS3 at 1080p. I went down to Target and picked up a Phillips cable (1.3b Cat 2, also)... Now the Samsung connects to the PS3 without issue. I could recommend this cable for 1080i connections, but for the Samsung LN 52A650, I would stay away."
4,Decent for the price,Bought this for my (nonHD)DVD player. It works well considering the price.You can see very easily that it doesn't provide the highest quality images. I could not be able to use it for my HD components. But for all non HD it works absolutely well. I would recommend to my friends for these uses..
1,JUNK!,Cable did not function AT ALL. Not worth the hassle or expense to send back. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. IT DID NOT WORK!
3,exactly what I needed,"Super FAST shipping! exactly what I needed..... The quality of the picture wasn't fantastic, but then again I didn't pay much for it :) great seller. Quick and reliable. Will do business again...."
5,great value,My first experience with HDMI and I am not disappointed. I had read that most HDMI cables are overpriced. This cable works beautifully; upconverted DVD's are a tremendous improvement. I see no reason to spend $50-100 for a cable when less expensive products of this quality are available.
3,ok cable,"cable was ok, just not heavy duty enough for a good Blu Ray player or Gaming unit, caused sporadic signal, had to purchase a heavier gauge cable for my player/receiver to get a continuous signal. works fine for a regular DVD player or from cable box to TV."
2,Not 3D compatible,"This is a good deal for the money. Beforwarned though, these cables are not 3D ready. Their picture quality and sound quality is better than component cables but substandard to higher quality/price HDMI cables. The old saying still applies, ""The price you pay directly affects the quality of your purchase."""
4,Its a cable and it works,Its just a cable and works fine. It seems a bit less robust than other HDMI cables I have bought but does the job!
2,Stop working after about four days,"It worked fine for a couple of days, then suddenly just stopped sending any signal. It's a really nice looking cord and did the job, I just wish It would have worked longer. You get what you pay for."
3,"""how bizarre""","I ordered an HDMI cable from Joma I think (good rating), and it must have been defective as everytime I bumped the table, or slammed the microwave oven door it went ""HDMI"" then blackout and on again a few seconds later. I've a brand new ASUS 22"" monitor (totally Awesome LED), and anticipating some connectivity issues with the HDMI cables I ordered another @ $4.09/ totally cheap. I couldn't believe the difference; as I now tap dance, play drums, and generally try to get the HDMI cable (#2) to disconnect, and it wont. I use my PS3 Console to play Battlefield, and it's 1080p beautiful now. I also recommend getting the 10 foot length HDMI cable. Food for thought"
1,I fail,please send the tracking number to track the package because I still to come. Please send number to locate the package
5,"Fantastic price, good cable.","Don't let those big box stores fool you into buying HDMI cables for $100 or more. It is a DIGITAL cable - the signal is either THERE or it isn't. There is no such thing as super high quality HDMI cables. This cable works great, and is very inexpensive."
1,not needed with the soundbar as amazon suggested.,it is to costly to send it back but i will never by from amazon again.
5,Great value for ordinary hdmi cables,These cables are very cheap and do just as good a job as the more expensive hdmi cables. Don't even think twice. These are the real deal!
3,"it works, but spotty after awhile","i've had the cord for a couple of years now and it's starting to not work. when the monitor shakes a bit, the display goes out and i need to fiddle the cord to get it back on. as long as the cord doesn't move, the picture stays. it's getting to the point where i'll have to get a new one soon...perhaps i'll spend a bit more money on a better quality construction."
4,Save yourself a ton of money and buy these,I don't know why anyone would spend more than $3 for an HDMI or audio cable anymore these days. Pretty much every consumer and tech blog has confirmed that the cheap chords function just as well as the crazy overpriced cables. Just buy these and you'll be fine.
4,Price vs. Performance,"I'm not an audiophile or videophile- I don't need a $85 HDMI cable to connect my 360 to my TV that's an arm's length away. All I want is a simple cable to get the job done.You simply can't beat the price on this guy- even if it was a dud, you're only out $10 if you include shipping. If this cable doesn't get the job done, you're either too picky or you're doing something wrong."
1,quit working after one week!,"I bought it to connect my ipad to our TV. Unfortunately, it only worked for less than one work, then only can hear the voice, no video. totally wast time and money!"
3,You get what you pay for,I was hoping the cable would of been a little better but you get what you pay for. I recommend a higher priced cable for HDMI than this one.
5,Why haven't you bought this yet?,"This is the product you are trying to buy. You got suspicious when the guy at Best Buy told you that the cable for your new TV would be almost as much as the TV itself so you went online and did some research. You have found this, but are worried because how could something so cheap be the same as the triple digit cable at the big box store. Well guess what? If you are not looking for anything more than a basic HDMI cable, do yourself a favor and BUY THIS CABLE IMMEDIATELY!"
1,BEWARE OF THESE CABLES!!!,"I know, I know... You dont have to spend $40 on a cable. The $1.00 ones work just fine. Well, thats tru and not true. On some tvs, blu ray players etc they will work fine. But some of them will not. I bought 2 and learned the hard way. Both did not work. But in the past I had bought a cheap one that works great. So just beware. Because I didnt use them until after 60 days, I couldnt get a refund from these guys even though they do not work with my equipment. I would rather buy the amazon basics brand for $9.99 from now on which I did. At least if there is a problem in the long run you have a better chance of getting a new one or a refund."
1,Bad Quality,I bought this and set it up for my Roku LT. It worked for about 2 hours then developed a problem. The connection is not strong and there are lines and static in the picture on the TV. I replaced the cable with another HDMI cable I had on another device and then my picture was fine. It's not worth returning for $1.61 but it's a pain to have to order and wait for another cable.
5,OK Cable,This cable works fine between the cable box and high def TV. The length was right and the quality appears to be very good.
2,I wouldn't purchase this again,"This cable is cheaply made, something you might find at the dollar store. It does work, but quality is not so good and I could not tell a difference, (albiet, I am not vvery perceptive in being able to see subtle differences)."
5,Perfect!,"I bought two of this cable. They work perfectly with my dvd player, apple tv and arrived soon and very well packaged!!!! It worth to buy......... Thanks!"
2,Did not work.,This cable worked for about 2 days then the picture started to go in and out. In about a week the cord stopped working totally. I switched to a new cable that I had bought from a store and I have not had any problems. The low price is too good to be true. I now know that I need to pay a little more for a good working cable.
5,Simply put: they work,"To paraphrase another review on the site: I bought them, plugged them in and they work. Paying a lot of money for HDMI cables is a waste."
5,great product,Bought these when I got new HD TV and they worked flawlessly. You can buy these same things at a retail store for about 5x the price but these are the obvious way to go. The tv looked amazing with with the ps3 & blu-ray player and I'm still using these chords 3 years later today. They even survived the cross country move to CA!
4,excellent alternative to expensive cables,"I bought a $20 top quality premium cable for my main living room large TV, was looking for HDMI cables for my smaller TVs in other rooms. Found this at great low price. Quality of picture is about 85% of my premium cable when used on the large TV. Occasional frames of static or blurred edges when compared to premium cable. It is smaller guage (about half the thickness) compared to my premium cable. However for smaller TVs, it is excellent value for the money at 1/10 the price. Will buy again for accessory TVs."
3,HDMI isnt as good as component,"Everyone raves about how hdmi is the best for hd...I bought this cable just to see for myself...My regular composite hd cables worked better for my tv....I've never had experience with hdmi before so it could have been my tv or the cord itself, not really sure, but the difference between composite and hdmi is HIGHLY noticeable"
1,Didn't Work!,"Was excited to get the product, however it my excitement didn't last. It doesn't work. I can see the picture, but don't get any volume."
3,You get what you pay for.,"I purchased this cable to connect a monitor to a my PC. The monitor would not enter ""power save mode"" when the PC was turned off or put to sleep, screen would just say ""HDMI cable disconnected"". Wasted a great deal of time searching through support forums before moving the monitor to another PC where it worked fine. So I moved the monitor back to where I had it and swapped HDMI cables. The problem followed this cable. I had bought 2 of them and they both have the same issue. It appears they are missing a circuit that other HDMI cables have to monitor the connection to the device. Spend the extra couple bucks for a better cable to ensure that your system will work properly."
4,HDMI Cable,"Great price, quick delivery, looks good, works well in my application on PC connection to TV.Really do not have any way to compare quality in performance well enough to give highest rating."
1,don't buy this item,My fiance bought this item and it did not work! It just made the tv fuzzy and it was just cheap I guess. What a waste of money.
1,Worth the price,I ordered 2 cables and they both died within 3 days of light use.I paid $25 for a cable at Walmart and haven't had any problem with that one.YMMV.
2,Cheap sometimes is not better!,"I bought this cable because of the price. Cheap sometimes is not better! After a few hours of being used, the cable does not transmit anymore. I don't know if it gets hot or what, but after another hour it starts up again! I guess I could buy several for the price & just change them out! LOL! How annoying would that be!"
1,Cable defective,The cable did not work.I verified the cable was defective by swapping a known good cable and this one. I tried the cable on two different devices and it was sporadic on one device (hold a signal for a few seconds then drop) and would not work at all on the other device. My known good cable worked fine on both devices.
4,I cant understant why people buy them on regular stores,"I consider myself a techie and I cannot understand why people buy this cables at such a higher price in stores, unless you have tons of cash to spend or want to show off the incredibly expensive cable you bought.This cables do their job just right great definition, good sound. Beautiful Price!!! I have bought 6 cables from this company great delivery, no issues what so ever...."
5,"Amazing price, good product","I did a little research and came to the conclusion that an HDMI cable is an HDMI cable, no matter the cost. I have bought 2 of these, at different times, from this seller and both were shipped quickly and work perfectly. One I've had about 10 months, the other about 3, and both are great."
1,"The long, long, long wait . . .","I ordered this cable the same day I bought a 32"" LG LCD HD TV from Amazon. The TV arrived in four days. When I swapped out my cable box for a HD set top box it came with a high quality HDMI cable. A week later I asked Amazon where is the cable I bought? They forwarded my request to the vendor. The vendor said they shipped it USPS, I should be patient. Like I'm going to sit with a new LCD TV and not watch it for two weeks. Then the vendor said they were out of stock. After three weeks the HDMI cable arrived, it was puny, cheap looking and trashed in the next garbage pickup. This product is junk. You don't need the aggravation."
5,Great Value,"I bought this cable because it was offered when I bought my Wall Mount and thought ""why not, must be better than composite"".When I connected it, it was a huge difference in the quality of my Blue Ray DVD player.The construction is great, I recommend it."
1,Failed after one week,Suddenly my new BluRay DVD player stopped working. Tried a number of fixes and got ready to return the machine when I looked at troubleshooting and they suggested I swap out the HDMI cable. That was it -- to my surprise a defective cable.
1,Disappointing Shipping Service,"I ordered two of these cables at the same time I ordered my Sony TV. I received the TV on a Friday, but no cables, and needed the cables to complete the setup. Guess what, no setup over the weekend. Also, the tracking number for the shipment was supplied to me via Amazon email message. My understanding is that UPS picks up the package, and delivers it to the US postal service for shipment. The tracking number was not in either system through the whole time it was in transit. I sent an email to the shipper through Amazon asking for assistance (Amazon sent me a confirmation of my sent message), and I never received a reply from the shipper. It was poor performance all the way around. I think that there is no excuse for this substandard performance considering the high tech communication environment that we now have in the electronic business marketplace."
2,just ok,"i would not recommand that to a friend, but if u just just wanna use Hdmi and the image is not that important for u. well u can get that ithem"
1,This cable did not work.,"As other reviewers commented, this cable did not work. I first tried it on my LG TV and then on my Samsung TV. The message displayed on the TV was no signal. I then plugged in a regular cable TV cable into my TV and it worked. Although it is inexpensive I would not buy this product because it is defective."
5,Nothing to complain about.,"People may be skeptical when it comes to buying cheap things that are usually expensive; truth is, this thing works. As a college student, I use it mainly to connect my laptop to my TV or to play ps3.Great quality."
5,HDMI Cable,Ordered the cable on Sept 26th and got it on the 28th. Very speedy deliviery. I was very pleased with the product
5,Best Price on the Market,"every hdmi cables are the same, except the quality is different depending on which version you buy. The most recent version of the hdmi cable is different than the ones that came out like 2 years ago because the standard for the hdmi cable change as hd tv will continue to improve every year. So every hdmi cable should have the same standard and you should not go to a store and buy a $50 monster cable. The store is a rip off, there is absolutely no difference in quality between a $2 cable from a $50 cable. If you don't trust me then do some research online and find out if there is a difference in quality between a cheap cable from an expensive cable. People should not be paying over $10 for a hdmi cable period."
3,ok,"works ok, but the connector does not fit the hdmi port perfectly. I have a philips hdmi cable and the quality of both products is very different. I paid 20 times more for the philips though. Was it worth it I do not know but now I keep this hdmi as a spare one."
5,HDMI Cables,"These cables work fine. One connects our Apple TV and another our DVD player to our Sceptre 40"" flat screen. Absolutely fine signal quality compared with some of the higher prices cables from well known electronics stores. Don't hesitate to buy them."
5,Same Value For A Fraction Of The Price,"I bought Monster Cables from Best Buy for $40.00. When I saw these online, I immediately returned the Best Buy cables and ordered these. Great investment as there is no difference except more money in my pocket."
5,The Best HDMI VALUE EVER!,"I ordered this product on a whim to see if I could find a decent HDMI for my ps3 and stand alone blu ray player. I was slightly afraid to purchase this as the next cheapest cable I saw online or in store was atleast $25. Sure enough it arrived in the mail quickly, and it hooked right up into both of my devices and provides an excellent picture quality and sound. (Tested on my Sony Bravia) Honestly, do not spend the money on expensive cables, as this cable preforms identical to the expensive store bought one I returned after buying this one."
5,hdmi test,"Hi, saw a test they did on tv .The experts tested the high-price verse low -price checked for picture quailty they cound find no difference between the two.Concluetion buy high-pricehdmi you wasting your money doing this."
5,Great cord for a fraction of retail,"This was an excellent buy on an HDMI cable. For a fraction of what you would pay in a brick and mortar, this cable does the job."
2,this is not good,this is not good as the cable developped the crack and it did not work and I had to throw
4,Good HDMI cables,These cables made a great way to get an introduction to HDMI without spending a fortune.
1,You get what you pay for.,I bought two of these cables. One doesn't work at all. The other works intermitently. Avoid these and buy something of higher quality.
1,Worked for 5 minutes,"Worked fine for about 5 minutes.... Plugged it in from the DVD player to the HDTV and picture looked rad. Then 5 minutes later swapped in a different DVD and nothing. Wiggled the cable a bit and got a partial picture with no sound. No change after unplugging/plugging back in, etc.Good thing it only cost me $1.77 delivered."
5,great product at a great price,"i was skeptic about buying cheap hdmi cables specially reading some of the horror stories that some people experienced. Overall i have to say this product is great, shipped quickly and has performed flawlessly in the month that i have it. i do have to make notice of some weird lines that showed up in the first day of using the cables but i attribute that to dirty hdmi sockets, after i cleaned them up everything works great... A++++ on this one."
5,WOW,"Hdmi 2m (6 Feet) Super High Resolution CableAfter plugging this cable into my Sony Bravia 42"" HDTV the picture was dramatically improved. Watching the Super Bowl was just like being there at the game!!!!! WOW is all I can say. I even told my cousin about it and he will be buying one himself"
5,Real value for money,"Does what it says on the tin, for a sensible price. Decent postal rate too, arrived when promised.Recommended supplier"
2,Product vs service,It took 1 month to receive this product and it held up my connecting my DVD player. NOT happy with that service. Unwilling to rate product any better than average because I didn't receive it in time to use it before comment was requested.
1,es una basura!!!!,"compre dos de esta basura haciendole caso a los comentarios y para probar si en verdad influye el que sea un cable caro a uno barato pero en verdad que es un pedazo de basura, lo prove en un ps3 y un wd hd player , uno de los cables no funciono en ninguno y el otro hacia interferencia y se ponia la pantalla rosada y yo que se cuantas cosas mas, asi que por favor no compren esta basura si lo piensan usar para algunos de estos dos reproductores."
5,Worked perfect,Was a little worried at first when I unpackaged the cables because they were thinner than the other HDMI cables that I am currently using. No worries though. They worked perfect.
1,"pay more, buy a better one","Mine is Sony Bravia 1080i, 17 Hz, 37"". As soon as the component cables were unplugged and new HDMI was plugged in, the picture quality deteriorated dramatically; hazy picture as if a thin veil was laid on the image, the colors lost their solidness and vividness and more important: so sound!Once I plugged the old component cables back in, it gained its crystal clear, super natural image quality. I thought that this HDMI could beat that quality, but it didn't. I tried, it didn't work out..."
1,Not worth the $2.00 that I paid for it....,"I own a 50"" Samsung plasma. Picture clarity was worsened with this cord. Regular A/V cords do a better job transmitting the picture."
1,Very cheap!,"I did not like this product at all. For HDMI type of cable, I was expecting a much higher quality product. The plastic is really cheap. Just looking at it, made me feel like I was going to lose quality and resolution."
1,Worked for 2 months and then nothing,"At first I was very happy with this cable. I hooked up our Blu-player and it worked great and all seemed fine. But within the first 3 months we began to have problems. Sometimes it would work fine and then sometimes it would act like there was no Blu-ray player hooked up. Then after a few more months, it wouldn't work ever. The Blu-ray player is working fine as it will work with our other HDMI cables. The price might be good but not if you will have to buy a new one every few months."
5,great deal,"This cable works just as well as a $20 cable, as far as I can tell. I hooked it up to my HDTV and the picture is great."
5,High quality,"This hdmi cable was new, clean, undamaged and solved the issue of changing cables every time from Xbox to DVD. The narwhal bacons at midnight"
4,Good value for money,"I bought this cable to use for my new Sony Bluray disc player (BDP-S580). It works just fine, I love it. Considering the low price you have to pay for this cable, it's just amazing value for money. I don't know why people spend 100 bucks for a cable. What can those do more than this cable? Maybe someone who has one of those expensive cables can explain?"
1,Doesn't work for me,"The HDMI cord doesn't work for me. I tried it out on three different HD T.V.'s and it didn't work on a single one. It was constructed well and seemed to be a good product, but I can't really get past the fact that it doesn't work. It may just be my cord as I have seen plenty of other reviews that say it works perfectly. I decided to go with this one.Mediabridge Ultra Series - High Speed HDMI Cable with Ethernet - Category 2 Certified - Supports 3D & Audio Return Channel [Latest HDMI Version Available] - (6 Feet). It's a couple bucks more, but at least it works."
3,Ok its cheap,I likenit because it was cheap the quality looks ok nothinng special. But the best pice in the market i could find
3,Low quality materials = inferior product = cheap prices,"It did its job for the price but the video was super dark. Do yourself a favor. If you buy a big expensive TV, invest $30 in nice expensive HDMI cables."
5,Affordable HDMI Cables,"Bought 3 of these HDMI cables after reading a review on them on CNET.COM. CNET uses these inexpensive HDMI cables to wire their ""Electronics"" testing lab and review a multitude of electronic products. These work as well as any high dollar cable. I'm using them on my 3D TV and 3D Blu ray player. And they work great. Don't be fooled by overpriced HDMI cables."
2,Good picture but sound?,"After having these cables for a few months, I think I am going to switch back to the monster cables! Here is why, it is true that the picture is not any better however the sound has pops when the network switches to commercials, from the original broadcast to your local commercials either from the slight delay or something when the switch over in the broadcast is made. It doesn't happen very often but I noticed it right away. When I first tried the monster cables no popping or switchover sound, I then tried these and another brand of cheaper cables and the sound is there. I have cox cable it happens on HD channels and non HD. I notice it the most on Bloomberg Asia report but it also happens on MSNBC and other channels, just not as often. My sound is played through Bose v20 5 speaker system. You get what you pay for!!! As soon as I find the Monster cables on sale these are gone!!!!!"
5,Don't buy Monster,Save your money and buy yourself something pretty instead. This cable is just as good as all the 80+ dollar ones out there.
2,Dont buy this for the Xbox 360,I bought this cable cause its cheap like me. It got here in 1 day practically but it doesnt work for the xbox 360 you get the famous E74 error usually pertaining to a bad AVI/HDMI cable. I picked up a cable at frys for 2 bucks more and dont have an issues. Wish i didnt waste the money though.
5,Boner Jams 08,"Got 2 cables, both work great, never spend in store prices for HDMI, these are same quality and way cheaper."
5,Excellent,"Best value for the price, Never thought that this will be too good to connect my Samsung 40"" HDTV with Toshiba Blueray BDX2150 player and my dell studio laptop too."
3,2/3 worked,"I bought extra as buffer, and it's a good thing I did. Two of the cables worked fine, but one caused the screen to flash periodically. Fortunately the price made it a bargain, even with buying extra."
1,It doesn't work,"The first one I got didn't work on my bd player(panasonic cheapest one), and LG LCD TV. I wrote an email to the eforcity, and they mailed me a new one in few days. However, the second items works, but it has lots of noise on the screen, then I asked them to mail me a new one, then there is no more reply....I didn't receive anything yet. compared with another cable I ordered after I found it doesn't work from amazon, this cable is very very thin compared with the high quality thick cable. Just don't buy this one, you can spend $10 to have a great one on amazon without feeling upset with this product."
5,works,it works. It is a heavy duty cable. No need to spend $40 for the same thing at the brick and morter stores.
1,Did not work,"Not a fluke in a single cord, I bought two of them and neither work. Do not buy these. Tried on my PlayStation 3, tried on my cable box, nothing. Will not work with HD, and they are not the cords pictured. Keep on looking."
3,Watch Out,"I bought six of these cables for my home theater set up. I was disappointed that one of them did not work. I installed the cable and the picture would come across distorted. The sound horrible. The other five were okay, no problems. The only negative is that one of them did not work."
5,Great Deal,"If you go to your major electronics chain store, you will undoubtedly notice the price of their HDMI cables are ridiculous -- most start around $30+ for a 6ft cable. Additionally, their incompetent pimply-faced teenager reps will try to talk you into the much more expensive name brand cables that could exceed $100.00+ What they don't realize is that HDMI carries a digital signal which isn't affected by cable quality -- on or off is what you get. Do yourself a favor and go with the deal here on Amazon for a fraction of the cost. I only needed 1 but these are such a great deal I ordered 3 with 2 backups in case I need to expand my hardware. They arrived quickly and work perfectly -- 2 Thumbs up here."
5,Who needs those crazy price when you have this...,"I got this item 2 days before the Delivery estimate time. Thank you so much, but I haven't gotten my TV yet, so I'm going to wait for that, but this is my first time ever to have something this cool in my room. Won't be able to get the TV till Feb, so my PS3, and my HDMI cable will be lonely for awhile. Thank you again!Also, I will buy from this company again."
1,"Wow, momma told me there'd be cables like this...","I should have known better...I hate cliche's but I truly got what I paid for - junk. Straight out of the package the cable felt and look flimsy. Flat out defective. Static, signal comes in and out, etc, etc. Not worth paying the return shipping and waiting only to receive another potentially junk cable.Steer clear and invest some actual dollars. My first HDMI cable that I bought 6 years ago is still working like a charm. Of course, it was from a known manufacturer and cost 10 times as much. In hindsight it has proven to be a helluva deal. Guess I was feeling like a daredevil and took a chance...rolled the dice and lost, but, fortunately, only a few bucks."
2,You may want to find somethif better,"You may want to find a better HDMI cable for serious use. My computer to an HD LCD TV would not even recognize this cable. My PS3 to an HD LCD TV would only recognize this cable up to 720P. I do have a Blu-ray player to an HD LCD TV, and this cable seems to work fine for this setup, so that is where this cable will stay. I've bought other HDMI cables for around ten dollars that have great quality and will work on all my devices. This one for under three dollars my have been just a little too cheap. I recommend paying a little more and getting a better cable."
3,DONT BUY VERY LOW QUALITY,Im sorry to be writing such a bad review on this item. I paid like 3 bucks for it. You have to wiggle it to get it to work. I know its this wire because ones in the past never did this. Very low Quality product. You get what you pay for. I went cheep and well i got cheep.
5,Great value!,"I ordered two of these because of the price, in hopes I wouldn't have to spend over $20 in a store! They work great, and I am so glad I didn't waste money! No complaints!"
5,nice!!!!!!!!,I received the product in the stated time and couldn't wait to try it. I plugged it into my laptop then to my HDTV and within seconds I could clearly see the laptop on the big screen. Very good picture and sound quality thyanks!!
5,Great buy!,I was very happy with how fast I received this product. The cable is of much better quality than what I could get at the store but a lot cheaper!
5,HDMI CABLE,"I use this with a Mini DisplayPort to HDMI adapter for my macbook pro for watching movies mostly on a 52"" samsung. Great video and audio quality, the cable seems very robust and it won't break open in anyway. Shipping was OK it was kinda slow but in same shipping box was my adapter and some other stuff."
1,Horrible Cable,"Thought I was getting a good deal when I purchased this, however the cable was so awful, I was better off using the old cable from my DVR player, not an HDMI. BAD quality. Now I have to get a new one."
5,Great cable,"Its simple: this cable does everthing that anHDMI cable should do, without the $30 price tag. Getthis cable, you will be happy."
1,junk doesn't work,I bought 3 of these (none of them worked frome the start) I had to go to good will to get used ones to replace these. Signed: not a happy camper!!!
5,GREAT !!!!!!!,Forget going to bestbuy adn buying an expensive 100 hdmi cable for no reason ! Get this cable that i got for 1.75 shipping included and be happy! just recieved mine recently and hooked it up to my XBox 360 and it made madden 12 so amazing and every other game i have !
5,Great HDMI for the money!,I wasn't sure that I was getting much for the small amount of money I paid. I was surprised at the quality of the sound and picture from this HDMI cable. I recommend this to everyone.
5,Quality and affordability. My favorite combo,"Everyone knows how much the big electronic stores charge for quality HDMI cables. Sometimes the cable itself costs more than the device you're using it to connect to your television. I really appreciate an affordable option to get something that works and costs a fraction of what I would have paid at Best Buy. I also appreciate how fast the shipment arrived. Came within a few days of the order. If you need a quality HDMI cable,this is the way to go."
5,Work Great,Why the hell would anyone pay 80 dollars for a dam cable when you can get them so inexpensive here. There must be something wrong in this world. If someone takes the pepsi challenge and can find an actual noticeable difference then so be it. The only thing that could go wrong with more generic cables would be the conectors. If you can jiggle the cable and you signal distorts then its no good. This problem does not exist with these cables.Would definitely by again.
4,great cable,great cable amazon is the only place to buy hdmi cables even the lowest qty one here on amazon will work great this is a vary nice cable
2,1 out of 4 cables didn't work,"I bought four cables and one of the four did not work. The other 3 seem fine, but a bad cable isn't acceptable."
3,HDMI Cable 2 M,"I bought 4 of these wirings recently and they came with an end protector (plastic caps) at each end of the cable. The quality of the grounding copper encasement is not too good. When I remove the end protector by pulling away the plastic piece, the grounding encasement came out together with the plastic end cap. And there goes 1 piece of my wire. Later I discovered that I should not be pulling the end-protector plastic cap off, but instead remove them by swirling the plastic end cap in a left-right and right-left motion."
1,Totally worthless HDMI cables.!!!!!!,These HDMI cables are cheap and totally worthless!!! Save you money and get ones that are name brand. I bought six of them and none of them work.
1,cabo hdmi,I bought a hdmi cable on 23/03/2011 until 24/04/2011 today is not that what happened came with my purchase? and still sends me a message to make my purchase on this then there CADE MY CABLE THAT TILL TODAY NOT ARRIVEDOuvirLer foneticamente
4,Works Great,The cords work well and the picture that I get is great. great product for a great price. I loveboobies
5,Quick delivery - works great!,This was shipped immediately and arrived very quickly. Great service. Would recommend to anyone.
5,Bought 2 - work like a charm,"I'm new to the world of HDMI cables. I had my old HDTV hooked up via component cables. Having bought a new HDTV (32"" Panasonic Viera - 720p) and Blu-Ray player (LG BD300) I knew I needed to get some quality cables. Looked at prices and reviews and these looked like the perfect option. I now have my system hooked up and everything is working beautifully. Like others, I can't understand why anyone would pay upwards of $30 for HDMI cables when these are out there."
1,broke after one day!,"Cable stopped working in only 24 hours! This is not acceptable! We waited for this cable for almost a week with our new PS3, this is heart-breaking and we don't know if our baby PS3 got damaged internally or not. DO NOT BUY!"
3,Be careful,"This cable worked great for me until I added A/V receivers into the mix. I tried both Onkyo and Denon receivers and when using this cable, the video and audio constantly drop out. I swapped this with a more expensive cable (a Rocketfish cable from Best Buy) and it works fine. I like how cheap this is but I won't buy it in the future because I'm convinced this cable is the problem. Everyone may tell you ""all HDMI cables are the same"" but I'd be careful. I'm not suggesting that you buy a ridiculously expensive Monster brand cable, but maybe look at a higher quality cable than this."
3,"Great picture, poor audio","I ordered this product to hook up my Xbox 360 to my new HDTV. I was initially very impressed with the picture quality, but when I played NBA 06 for the first time, I got crackling feedback during portions of gameplay. Now this has never happened using the standard component cable that was included with the Xbox, so I know that the cable is the problem. I let the manufacturer know, and they were nice enough to send me a second cable to see if the first one was defective. Well, the second cable arrived, but much to my disappointment, the same issue occured with the second cable as well. The crackling feedback occurs during parts of other games as well, but usually during unimportant parts of the game. The cable works great during Halo3, so I'm unsure as to what is causing the problem. Overall, the video quality is so much better compared to the component cable, that I still use this product. Good value for the money!"
1,Cheap is cheap,Broke after 10 seconds while trying to install it.What can I say - Cheap is cheap. At least I did not waste too much money.Would not recommend it at all.
2,Odd shape,Would not fit into HDMI port I bought it for - was able to swap with another HDMI cable on my blue ray player but would not work on my HD TV or the PS3 I bought it for as I could not insert it into the port due to non conforming shape.
3,Just OK and not nearly long enough,I kinda liked it. The audio was bad the picture quality was goo but not 1080p. An I dont know any one who likes the length. You may think that it is long enough but IT IS NOT. Go for a nice quality 10 or 12 foot cable.
5,WOW!!!! GREAT DEAL,WOW!!! Where can you go wrong 5 cents $3.03 total oh my god thank you so much!!! I got this for my ps3! All store charge u $30-$35 for a 6 ft! Buy here so much cheaper and worth it Amazons the best I am still so amazed!
1,Beware!,"Fuzzy reception on TVs--high-def, standard-def, didn't matter. Several visits from the cable guy later, turns out it wasn't low signal outside the house, low signal inside the house, or anything specific to the cable infrastructure, boxes, or TVs. All we had to do was replace these HDMI cables, and everything worked fine. Very annoying. I think the five-star reviews are likely ballot-box-cramming. These are junk."
3,good for the price,"They were shipped very fast, It was very good price and works just like a 30 dollar one from best buy. I would recommend getting this if you need an HDMI."
4,Order went smoothly and item appears as advertised. Unused to date.,"Order went smoothly and item appears as advertised. Unused to date and serving as spare. blah, blah, ditto,blah, blah"
5,Can't go wrong with this price,"Bought this cord for a little over 3 bucks, and you really can't go wrong with that. It worked just like it's supposed to, with no issues."
1,DID NOT WORK!!,"I looked over all of the reviews and was pretty confident in this product. It arrived in no time at all. It was in great shape; however, when I plugged it in it flashed a pink and black snowy screen. To see if the cord was faulty, we tried my brother's HDMI cord that looked completely different than the one that I purchased from here. It worked fine. I am not going to return this product considering it was so cheap and not worth the hassle. But I DEFINITELY would NOT recommend this product to anyone. Pay a little more for something that will actually work."
1,Has audio problem,"I couldn't see the difference in the picture quality, but there was a big problem for the sound. i have Yamaha RX-V2600 receiver and Toshiba HD DVD player.So, when i connected this cable from DVD player to the receiver, i just got 2.0 channel PCM signal no matter what i play (DTS/DTS ES, Dolby Digital/Dolby Digital EX, Dolby TrueHD). On the other hand, when i switch to monster cable, i had no problem; the receiiver was getting the same imput when playing DTS/ES, DD/EX, and MPCM (5.1 channel PCM) when playing Dolby TrueHD, Dolby Digital Plus."
5,Works amazing costs next to nothing,These cables work awesome. I compared them to some so called mid grade ($30)cables bought from a big box retail store and there is no difference in sound or picture quality. if you are suckered into paying a hundred dollars for hdmi cables then you have been robbed.
1,"Worked once with each adapter tried, then quit","Hellish. Would work once with each adapter I tried, then quit. Because it worked fine on a friend's laptop I assumed it was the adapters (mini display port to HDMI) that were failing or that I had some kind of software bug. Excruciating weeks were spent ordering new adapters off amazon and searching for software bugs until I realized it was this chthonic HDMI cord. Would not buy again."
3,Good,Its not the best but the price is right. I hook it up although the back cable from the tv is a little bit tough to bend. siggust they design a side angle cable
5,A Great Buy,This item (DVI Gear HDMI Cabl2 2M 6 ftte) is well worth the cost.It is and does all that I expected it to do.
3,Excellent device - but spotty QC,"This device is a real powerhouse - very strong xmit and receive makes it able to hit distant APS easily. Problem is, the QC is spotty and you can get a device that's erratic or won't work out of the box. I saw this from others who'd bought the same or similar devices (same base piece) and it's true. reviews are either all good or all bad. Black and white. If they improved the QC going out the door, they'd sell a lot more of these. As is, most people aren't willing to try again when something doesn't work first-time, and a 50/50 out of the box chance of failure is discouraging for the non-techy.Oh, and I'm asking for a return and a second device. The first was superb."
5,Really nice!!!,I literally paid $0.75 for this... never had any problems and it is super easy to figure out! Great Buy!!!
3,Cheap,if your expecting these cables to work like Monster cables your looney. these cables cost like 2 bucks and while they do work i dont recommend them to be used on something that actually produces a 1080p signal (blu-ray) because its glitchy but for an upconvert dvd player and even your cable box.. there perfect.
3,you get what you pay for,"I purchased this cable for my PS3 based on other reviews. Was impressed after hooking up and seeing my photos in high resolution. But then I hooked it up to my Dish DVR and boy I could see the quality difference with my original Sony HDMI cable and this one. Picture quality is absolutely stunning with Sony's original one and this one just lacks it, although sound quality was comparable. Before this comparison, I was of the opinion that its just digital signal transfer and how bad that could be with branded hdmi and this one, but i was wrong. So if i am going to view blue-ray on PS3 then I have to get good quality cable, but just for gaming this cable would be absolutely fine i guess."
5,HDMI at a great price.,I ordered several of these as I am sure I will have more HDMI products in the future. The price is a steal. I saw a similar cable at CompUSA for $70 and felt pity for the poor fool that paid that.
4,As good as brand name store items costing 10 times more!,"Fantastic value for the money. Excellent quality all around, including construction, signal quality and apparent durability."
4,Good product.,"Got these for my new Samsung 1080p with FiOS and they work just fine. I do not have anything to compare it against; to me its just a different output cable and not sure if regular red,white and yellow would work the same.Anyway, I use it for FiOS HD and I get clear picture and sound, thats about it.I did get three of these, one for each device I have (or on wish list).Zia."
1,Looks great but when you plug to TV nada nothing Zero,"just plugged it in, nada nothing zero.. used my shorter HDMI bought from local store, and no problem.. its the cable,, and I bought two... you get what you pay for."
5,Great Product,I have to say I had my doubts and fears about and HDMI cable for this price but damn this product is great. I am so glad I got three. I am using two right now on my dvd player and my computer to my tv. Amazing and all three work great.
4,It is what it is,"Just like all the HONEST people/outfits tell you, the ten dollar cable is as efficient as the high priced cables---yes even Monster cables. These cables which came to me, even cheaper as a deal with the TV I got, are very efficient and I am quite happy with them."
2,"Good cable, but not shielded.","This cable works just as well as any other cable. There are only two problems. First of all, the cable is unshielded which screws up the signal when near other power cords. I use my PS3 with this cable, and because the cable is close to the power cord, the signal gets interrupted which leads to lost audio and lag. Overall, i would not buy this cable again, because even though the price is so low, i would just get the same problems. It's best to get a Category 2 certified HDMI cable, and even those aren't too pricy, I am buying the MediaBridge one for $10."
3,Messes up when bumped,"I am using this cable for my Xbox 360. I have another cable from Best Buy for my DVD player. If this cable gets slightly bumped, a strong red tint covers the picture and the audio goes away. Recreated the issue on the DVD player and the store-bought cable works fine in my Xbox. Other than that issue, it works fine."
5,Awesome product,"you can get this product from Amazon almost for free. when you compare the price that they sell at Best Buy, this is soooo cheap though. Almost the same quality. It even beats the Walmart prices. I don't like to shop from Walmart anyways"
5,Monster cables are a monster rip,"These cables sell for $2.32 and they work perfectly. They are digital. There is no degradation in signal from the $149.95+ cables from Monster. If you ever wondered what God was doing before S/he created the Universe, S/he was making Hell for Monster Cable Executives. I have them hooked up from my XBOX 360 and PlayStation 2 to my 54 inch Samsung DLP/LED TV. Liberty City never looked so good.HDMI Cable 2M (6 Feet)"
2,HDCP,"Either the cable I received wasn't functional or these ARE NOT HDCP compliant. Most devices that transmit 1080P require HDCP, in these cases (from my experience) these cables will not work. Something you should definitely look into before you purchase."
5,HDMI cables worked flawlessly AND CHEAP!,Everything about the order went as advertised. The cables were new and worked first time out of the box. No problems at all.
4,HDMI Cable,"The cable works well, very sufficient for all of the use i anticipated for it to be. Shipped quickly as well."
5,Can't Beat the Price,"For 1/20th of the price compared to an HDMI cable bought in store, this product is amazing. There is little to no difference in quality for HDMI cables so you may as well get the cheapest. Being gold plated, the conductivity and connectivity are great. It was plug and play with instantly sharp picture."
4,hdmi,"I bought these before and they are real gud for the price, so i came back for more and now all my electronics in my home that uses these are connected with them, thanks for the deal. These are very good hdmi cables dont be fooled by the low price, they work well."
5,Awesome Deal on an HDMI Cable,"For a total cost of under $5 each, I ordered 4 of these HDMI cables and hooked them up to my new Samsung 40"" 650 Series LCD television. The quality of these cables is excellent for the low price. An HDMI cable is an HDMI cable, and with gold connectors, you can't go wrong. A great buy!"
5,Awesome,"I got two of this cables because are incredible cheaper.It is the best combination good and cheaper, I recommend this item a lot.I have another cable expensive than this and the result is the same, I use this to connect my laptop/PS3 to my LCD 1080p 40"" and the sound and image quality are very good."
1,Have not received,I was sent the HDMI cable and received a note from the Post Office stating it was returned due to insufficient postage. I was out of town and not able to pay the postage before it was returned. I am still waiting for this to be sent back to me.
1,very slow shipping,this dealer took over two weeks to send my cables I just purchased a new flat ldc tv and wanted to get it set up he advertised best deals on Amazon he should have stated slowest deals on Amazon. He promised me a refund after I complained about the delay If I would remove the negative review I removed the review and I have not recieved my refund despite numerous emails to him.
3,Why pay more for less?,"I purchased 2 sets of HDMI cables: 1-6ft pair of cables and 1-6ft (supposedly) higher quality single cable. Both items were the same price. When received all three cables were identical with the same part numbers. All of the items work, but the deception was very dissapointing."
1,THEY SENT ME 3 MINI HDMI CABLES INSTEAD OF REGULAR ONES!!!,"I bought 3 of these cables from these people and they sent me 3 HDMI cables with one end MINI ?? What the heck? Nothing is on the web page about mini, the pics don't show one end mini - I have never even seen any device that requires a mini! Let alone the devices they claim you can connect with these (tv's, receivers, etc.) now i have 5 bucks worth of junk that I paid 15 bucks to get mailed to me!!Bad Seller ! Bad Feedback coming in! I have bought hdmi cables from amazon before with no problems and no jr. rate bulls$iT"
1,Cable,My player is able to communicate with my TV. Doesn't work with this cable. I suspect some wires have been left out.
2,Didn't work.,I bought one of these cables and was so happy with it I wanted to buy a second one. The second one came in and was a completely different make than my last cable and didn't even work. You get what you pay for.
2,1 out of 3,"The HDMI Cables I got were not the ones pictured, although that's a small matter. My bigger problem was that 2 of the 3 HDMI cords I purchased gave me unbelievably fuzzy video. I at first believed it was a problem with the HDMI switcher I was using (although I believe that may be defective as well). But I used each cord straight from the devices (and Xbox 360 and a PS3) and achieved basically the same result. The third cord, however, appears to be working just fine.On the positive side, the shipping was very quick, I received the product 3-4 days before their earliest estimated delivery date. Hopefully the issue will be resolved easily, although I'm not sure if it's worth the time to worry about 3-4 dollars."
4,Great Price,"This was a great price at $1.52 compared to retail stores. Shipping was speedy, actually faster than promised."
2,Consider a different cable...,"It works just fine... in one of my tv's, but not the one I intended to use that cable on. Yes it was cheap, and seemed to work just fine in my SONY Bravia, but it is not detected by my Vizio, which was the tv I purchased it for to use my PS3 with."
5,Good enough for the price,This is all you need they are HDMI cables... have a 52 inch Sony Bravia W Series and love it ... along with a 7 in 1 Sony Receiver I bought on here and PS3.. plus new speakers.. my whole system rocks..
5,Cheap is as good.,"Don't waste your money on expensive HDMI cables. These do not have the big brand name, but they are very good quality."
4,HDMI Cable,"The shipping cost is outrageous...until you think about the ""normal"" off-the-shelf cost. I actually bought an HDMI cable at Wal Mart...$39.95. When I saw this one, I took it back. A couple of days wait and a somewhat unreasonable shipping fee is totally overshadowed by the overall value. Best to buy more than one and save on shipping. Even with the high shipping cost, it is a fraction of the cost of a single cable at the discount stores. Excellent value, timely shipping, will do it again and again. There is absolutely no reason to pay the high cost being demanded for these cables in the stores. Thanks for the option to buy reasonable and save money."
1,Dont buy. You've been warned.,"HDMI cables for less then $2?! Sounds too good to be true doesn't it?Well, it is. I ordered two, as part of an entertainment center upgrade for my Dads 70th Birthday. Both are defective.Red / white static when connected from: netbook, laptop, roku, x360, and ps3 to 3 different TV's, 2 different monitors in 2 different locations. I tried really hard to find some use for these.And should you want your money back? You get to pay for return shipping.You've been warned - buy a higher quality cable, or at least buy from a company that will stand behind their defective product and pay shipping costs for returns."
5,More than I expected,"I have a Sony Bravia 32-Inch HDTV connected to a Sony Blu-ray Player and Xbox 360 via Onkyo TX-SR606 7.1 Receiver. Previously I used 3 monsters cables that cost me above $180 and when I read a few reviews in amazon.com and other places about this DVI HDMI cable I was intrigued, I thought it wouldn't hurt to buy 3 of them since they cost less than a dollar each. The result was astonishing. For the life of me I could not tell the difference between the $59.99 Monster cable and the $0.78 DVI cable. The image quality was superb.I love gadgets and electronics but I have to say that this is the best deal I have ever got .. EVER"
2,This is not a good product.,"These cables are not very high quality. I bought them and checked the difference between them and the xbox 360 coaxials, coaxials are better. Playing bfbc2 with these cables, the screen rate is messed up, its really blurry when moving."
4,good,I like this cable. I use it to connect my xbox to the TV and it works really great. It is a good deal
5,6ft HDMI Cable,"Thanks for the product! Great accessory for my dorm room! A lot cheaper than buying one at a specialty store, or even Wal Mart!"
5,Awesome,"The cable is just like the $100 cables at the stores, but only $1! Shipping was ridiculously fast, also. Buy it if you're in the market for an HDMI cord! Don't get ripped off elsewhere!"
1,HDMI Cable,The first one did not function. The supplier quickly replaced it with one that did function.
1,"Cheap, Not What Was Advertised","I Will Not Be Ordering From This Supplier Anymore. Nor Will I Recomend Their Products. The Products They Advertise And What You Actually Get Are Two Different Things. The Quality Was Very Poor, The Picture Reproduction Was Speckeled With White Dot's. I Guess It's True You Get What You Pay For. I Will Spend The Extra Cash For Quality From Now On !!!"
5,Great product. Well worth the price!,"I was initially a little reluctant on purchasing this HDMI cable due to the cheap price. But after reading all the rave reviews about this product, I decided it was worth a try. I was able to get a 1080p connection from my PS3 on the first try. I have 2 of these cables and have not had an issue. 2 of my buddies use these cables w/ no issues as well."
1,Never got them,"ok so forget grammar, aaaahahahah ahahahah aha ah a ah a a;haah asdlfj asl dfhasldkfj sladjf c,xv dskhgl;sadklkcvx gnpaogskho[asihf read the title"
4,"Great look price, great product.","I picked up component wires because I figured they'd look the same as an HDMI cable. I hooked them up and really wasn't impressed ( using a 32"" 720p Samsung with upconverter dvd player). I paid way too much for the component cables so I didn't want to waste too much more money. So, I bought this HDMI cable. It's much better then the component cables in price and looks."
4,No issues.,"Simply put, just as described. Works fine. Hooked it up to my new Vizio blue ray with our HDTV and it works fine."
5,Bargain priced HDMI,"This HDMI cable works as advertised. When compared to cables costing 10X the price, this was a real bargain."
4,great product,This worked great for me. I recomend this to everyone. It arrived to my residence very quickly. And I am completely satisfied with this product.
4,"Good quality, good price","In the stores, cables always cost too much. Regardless of actual mfg cost, they throw in fancy packaging and add in the costs of distributors and display space and so forth. These are high quality, available, and a good price."
5,Excellent Value,Don't ever go to a physical store for an HDMI cable! Even the best store price can't beat online.Cnet.com recommends this brand. The price is extremely low. We've used the cable for one month with zero problems. The price was so low that I ordered a spare for future devices.
2,Stopped working after 3 weeks,"From all the positive reviews, I thought I was getting a nice product. However, in this case, you get what you pay for. This cable worked great for a few weeks, but then I started having issues with my Apple TV. After countless hours troubleshooting, I finally realized the issue was with the shielding on the HDMI cable. I thought the Apple TV was maybe a little more finicky with the content protection (DRM) and all, so I swapped it out with a HDMI cable connecting my DirecTV box. Lo and behold, my Apple TV worked flawlessly again. I'll be getting one from monoprice next, as I've had good experience with it. But, I'm sure there are other brands as well with budget HDMI cables that will last more than a few weeks."
4,Great,"HDMI Cable works great. I get HD for my ps3 for super cheap. Perhaps other cables would provide slightly better performance, I don't really know. But at this price, I have no regrets"
2,Cheap but LOTS of static.,"""You get what you pay for"" applies to this product... LOTS of static in the cable. It is intermittent about every 5-7 minutes and lasts for about 10-15 seconds. I would not purchase this product again."
2,Not very good quality,"I don't know much about HDMI cables and thought that all were equal but I was wrong. I have an HDMI splitter coming out of my PC's Graphics card and the splitter has two HDMI cables connected to it (my Graphics card signal is going to two tv's).The difference between the two HDMI cables I have is huge. The image of the HDMI cable in this review has lower quality (you can see green dots in the screen for no reason for example) and the speed of sending the image is slower (for example, I switch from word to excel and it lags).My other HDMI cable (which I don't know the brand) has perfect image quality and doesn't lag at all. Please note that I tested the two cables with the two tv's to ensure that the cable was failing and not the TV.I am not sure if this cable is enough for simple use but just wanted to post this in case that someone plans to use this cable with a similar setup."
1,Doesn't work,"I plugged this in on my new Roku box, my cable box, on different TVs, and it just doesn't work! There is no connectivity whatsoever."
3,"cheaper product, but it does the job.","cheaper product, but it does the job.cheaper product, but it does the job.cheaper product, but it does the job.cheaper product, but it does the job."
1,doesnt work with xbox and hdtv,"junk, yes it was under 2$, you get what you pay for. hooked up to xbox and it says ""not supported"" so i trashed it."
4,works,I'm really happy I found something like this. Never get ripped off by $30+ cables at Best Buy when you have affordable HDMI cables like this that actually work!!
1,Poor Quality Control?,"I purchased a quantity of 5 of these cables. I was disappointed to find that each of them performed poorly on every device I connected them to. This isn't the first time i've purchased discount HDMI cables on amazon either, so I felt like i knew what I was getting myself into. I tested on an xbox 360 and a Mac Mini 2011 model both connected to a 32'' LCD tv, and a separate monitor. Both devices performed as expected with a known good hdmi cable but had numerous display problems on these cables. These problems included artifacting, blurring, the screen making strange color combinations and showing scan line like behavior. I tried each cable in succession and found each one to be defective, no big deal they were cheap. I didn't see that a lot of other people were experiencing issues with these either so it may have just been a bad batch didn't make it through quality control"
5,awsome,"I have like ten of these. they ship fast, super cheap, and work great. I would highly recommend."
5,"Cheap, best!","Bought it after CNET listed it on their website as a good option. Bought it, using it for past few weeks with no problem at all. Oh yeah....did I say fassstt delivery!"
2,50-50 shot with these HDMI Cables,"I purchased 3 of these cables. I gave one away, and kept 2 for myself. Just the other day one of the cables went bad due to MINOR moving of cables around this one. I replaced it with the spare I had and that one still works.. So you may have a 50-50 shot at how long they last. If its not something important or something that may move at all you may be alright.. otherwise you may want to consider a more robust cable - these are so skinny compared to all my other HDMI cables."
5,No worries,"Cheap cable, works like a charm. Got here fast, no troubles at all. DO NOT buy expensive $50 cables. Just spend a few bucks and get one of these. Awesome."
5,HDMI Cables,Ordered 6 HDMI cables from Amazon.com @ 2.95 each. They are $17.95 each at Sams. Good buy. Recommend purchasing from Amazon
5,Great cables,These cables work really well. Just as good quality as the expensive cables. Never pay the high price for HDMI cables again.
1,Junk,"I bought four of these cables, and every one of them has screen flicker and snow. Sometimes they lose signal so long my TV says ""No Input Signal."" I often have to unplug and plug them back in, and then they work ok for a day or two. I tried to save a few bucks, and it didn't work. I replaced them with the cheapest name brand cable I could find, and no problems.Buyer beware."
2,thin,"If thickness of the cable was like of a mouse cable, So it appeared tho be cheap, so I was turned off at the start but when you consider the price."
2,There are better Hdmi cables that won't break the bank!!!!,"Okay simply put I purchased three HDMI cables: a Sony HDMI cable from Walmart, an Accel from [...] and this cable(All of which I interchanged on my PS3 to determine the best picture quality available from the three). Now of the three cables the Sony was the best of all I noticed the most definition with this cable. The Accel was pretty decent as well but lacked as much detail as the sony, but with this cable there is a picture and that's about it. I notice how this cable cant handle blu-ray well its too much data for this cable to keep up with which made colors look slightly off(they say its all 1's and 0's but I think this one's missing a couple.....hundred.....thousand of em)worst hdmi cable in my opinion. Do your self a favor and get a decent(not cheap)hdmi cable that wont break the bank!!!![...]"
5,Great product,Works just as well or better than products I've have paid many times more. Quality cannot be beat at any price.
4,Good and reasonable priced product,It came in on time and works great with my laptop and HDTV. I will definite buy another one if I need it.
1,"you get what you pay for, it does not work, very poor","It just did not work at all, I thought it was my device, but I went and bought a dhmi from walmart and it worked. So it was not my device it was this cable. very poor, you get what you pay for."
3,Just Cables,Not much to say except HDMI cables can always come in handy. Bought these as extras....Will find a suitable use for this on my new computer and our new TV...Thanks Amazon
5,Excellent product with given price.,Don't purchase branded because I have both. I have sony's HDMI cable also but I cannot differentiate in quality of picture after using both with the same device.
5,Best Cable for the price.,"I ordered this cord a few months ago for 3 bucks, Best cord I have ever had. I had bought some cheaper cords before and they all broke within a month. This cord is still going strong. For the price best cord out there."
5,Why pay more?,"Really, why pay retail prices when you can get a great HDMI cable as inexpensively as this one? It does the job just as well for a fraction of the cost."
5,Great,Product was high grade and worked great to connect my HTPC to my 42 780p Plasma TV. I have no complaints ans would recommend it to anyone.
2,HDMI cord,Both the original and the promptly sent replacement have problems keeping contact at the plug interface with my new WD Passport. A much more expensive cord maintains contact with no problems.
4,it does what its meant to do,"The cables are a good thickness, another brand that I ordered from before just feels too flimsy. They work exactly as they should, for a fraction of the cost of Hdmi cables that you'll find in any store. This cable is a no brainer."
3,"Excellent price, but bad performance","This cable is ridiculously cheap. However, it produces obvious noise on my TV. I'm sure it's the cable because the noise cleared up when I switched it with another cable while keeping everything else constant. (I also did this experiment twice.) Maybe I just got unlucky, but I found the cable basically unusable. Not bad for $2 though."
5,"Got my cable, thanks!","Didn't get when it was scheduled, but I think that was the post office...once i contacted them, got it resolved and corrected immediately, very glad it all worked out! Thanks for taking care of this for me!"
2,Not up to par,"Inexpensive, but not really worth it. I bought one when I purchased a TLC 40"" flatscreen. Would keep getting do not have permission errors on my Cisco HD box. Changed out 3 boxes. Turns out, when I changed out the cable, no more errors."
2,You get what you pay for,"I purchased this cable and used it on and off for three months before it started shorting out. It just is not a quality design. I wouldn't recommend using this cable in a mobile environment where you plan on moving around, plugging it in, and unplugging it a lot."
4,Good cable,"I use this to plug into my laptop and watch movies. It serves its purpose, but every once in a while there will be a line going across the screen, or the screen will freeze video and continue audio, speeding picture up after to catch up. Don't know if it's the cable, but for two bucks, I'll deal with it."
3,Not Very Durable,"Although this transmitted picture quality beautifully from my device to my television, it didn't last very long.I used this primarily when I wanted to connect my laptop to my TV. Unfortunately, after about 10 uses, the connector started to fall apart. First the gold-toned metal piece on the outside disconnected from the cable, but it was still useable. Then, after a few more uses, the inner structural piece, which holds the thin wire connectors in place, fell off, and the whole cable is now unuseable.So, I believe if I had used this in a stationary connection, one for which I didn't connect and disconnect the cables regularly, it would still be functioning. So if you want to use this cable for your dedicated Blu-Ray player or similar, it is a good value. If you are going to use it with multiple devices and be switching them around, you might want to spend more for a higher quality assembly."
5,HDMI Cables,"Why spend the ""big bucks"" when you can purchase the same cables for far less. Ordering was simple, the cables arrived quickly, and have been installed. There have been no issues using these non-name brand cables. I can't imagine why anyone would want to spend far more for the same quality."
2,Should've Read the Reviews,I picked up 4 of these thinking they'd just work based on the high review rating on amazon.I should've read the negative reviews because like most said these are not 1.3 certified.These cables will work with MOST HDMI equipment so they are still a great value. But if you are usingthe latest and greatest you will have issues.I only bought these because I was too lazy to pay the shipping from monoprice and that was my mistakeMonoprice cables are nearly the same cost much higher build quality and will work with just about everythingon the market today.I haven't owned these long enough to see if they are as brittle as other people have mentioned so I'm still giving this2 stars because for 90% of the public these cables will work fine(I put them on my cable box and Roku)Lesson learned.
4,works fine,It's an HDMI cable. There's not much to it. I have no idea why anyone would pay so much money for one at a store. At $3 I saved at least 80% over the prices at Walmart and Best Buy.
5,Great Value,A great value product for your HDMI needs. There is no need for large overpriced monster cables as these cables are just as good of quality as them. I haven't had to replace them as they have worked fine for a long time.
5,Good buy,"The cable took a while to ship which is expected when shipped from overseas. As for the product, it's exceptional for the price. I bought it for my xbox and after 6 months I have no complaints. If you would like to improve the quality of sound or display for a cheap price I would recommend this product."
1,"Didn't work, flashing picture","Tried two different Blu-Ray discs, picture would flash in and out. Tried a known working cable and the discs played fine."
1,Bad Experience,"When I bought this products, I spect a tracking number, it doesnt have, when the product arrived is was a wrong cable. my money was refund, but with a bad experience"
4,Hard to lose on this one....great deal,"I am not an videofile, but when I plugged this in there was a noticable difference from the standard cables. On my prvious HD set I paid $89 for a HDMI cable and with this one I paid more for shipping than the cable. I thought what do I have to lose....and it works great.No brainer!"
1,Poor customer service,"I ordered this product and needed to cancel it. I contacted the third party vendor via email and received no response to my inquiry (only generic email from vendor). I also contacted Amazon to see if they could assist me or contact the vendor, but they were unable to do so as the order had been processed by the third party vendor. Amazon suggested to return the product once I received it. The product arrived in the mail a week later and seemed more of a hassle to return."
2,You sometimes get what you pay for . . .,Check the ratings before you buy this. It is not Monster cable which does cost much more.
1,Not Worth the Paper it was Written On,"This book was very poorly written. It seemed to have no direction or true goal, other than an outlet for the author's feelings. He posed half the book in the form of questions. Then, the other half, interspersed throughout the paragraphs of questions, he gave brief answers to the questions based on his feelings. Most issues were mentioned, but none were truely addressed."
1,Inaccurate description....Shipping overcharge.,"The description of this book should be booklet, not a book, or activity book. It's just a few stickers with a cover. The size is not much larger than a recipe card.This booklet could have been sent for less than a dollar...and shipping time within 3 days. Instead the tiny booklet looks like a large book in the advertisement, and you're deceived into thinking it would require the same shipping as a book. It's small enough and light enough to be placed in an envelope or paper mailer.Then after I make my purchase for a dollar and a half, they start selling them for a penny.I've always trusted Amazon....but not anymore!"
5,A well written text,"This is a very well written book in that it is very easy to understand, all of the concepts are explained clearly, the chapters section-off the topics nicely, and it very readable despite the technical nature of the subject. I found every page of this book to be very interesting. The author includes some historical notes on the origins of quaternions and why they are so important. There's nothing quite like learning an interesting class of mathematics in which you are told right off the bat why you should be interested.This book is great for those who dabble in computer graphics. I do game programming as a hobby and I find that all my resources use quaternions from time to time. I picked up this book not knowing anything about them and found myself with all the information and motivation that I needed all in one place. I highly recommend this book to all who are interesting in quaternion mathematics."
4,Very Nice,"Book is more or less what all the glowing 4 and 5 stars say it is. I would like to add a 1859 quote from William Rowan Hamilton about his Quaternions in a note to Peter Guthrie Tait (professor and friend of James Maxwell):""Could anything be simpler or more satisfactory? Don't you feel, as well as think, that we are on a right track, and shall be thanked hereafter. Never mind when."""
1,"The ""mass media"" is Liberal!!","This book is ludicrous. the republicans don't control the ""mass media"" the left does. Couric,Rather,Brokaw,Jennings,. Left,left,left,left. C'mon, if you're going to go after the right at least bring something better than the right controls the media. Its laughable."
4,Fun Romance,"If you enjoyed Wonderful it will be fun to catch up with the characters again as Warrick puts in an appearance but this time Roger takes center stage. Humorous and tender at times this was a good, light read."
4,Enjoyed it,I had read the other books in the series and wanted to read this one. I enjoyed the story and recommend it.
4,good archival view of ww i,"I rented this first from my library and enjoyed it enough to purchase a copy. No, it does not have historian interviews etc and relies on archival film footage. A lot of the footage was new to me, not just the repeats that show up in program after program. I also liked the additional 'histories' of land, sea and air technology.Using historian interviews etc is sort of the Ken Burns approach to documentaries. This is more like the classic CBS series."
1,Waste of Time and Money,"As a history teacher, I've collected several historical DVDs to use in the classroom as instructional aids. Out of around 50 different series, this is by far the worst. The narrative is choppy with no thread of thought. Film clips are used repeatedly throughout the series. Don't buy this one. Keep looking."
5,"Great Bag,Great Price","I actually picked this bag up at a BB since i wanted to try the fit for my new Panasonic SDR-H60 camcorder.Perfect size, nice adjustable velcro partition,mesh zippered pocket in the flap, and 3 nice sized pockets on the front and 2 sides.It even has a strong velcro belt loop, has durable construction.Great value in my opinion."
3,Well made but quite small,"Like Lowepro products, well made, sturdy and light. But really small. My bad for not figuring out stated dimensions first. Bought for a small camcorder (Panasonic HDC-TM90), wanted to also store small external mic, extra battery, charger and a few cables. Not happening. This just might just fit a DSLR, or a camcorder and a few very small items. Side pockets are also tiny and won't fit anything more than an inch thick. I returned and opted for the Lowepro Edit 130 instead (which also just fits items mentioned)."
2,small,"I ordered this at the same time I ordered a Canon FS200 camcorder. Wanted to carry camcorder, power supply, wireless mic (transmitter and receiver) and camcorder manual. Bag is too small. I could fit camcorder and power supply. Manual doesn't fit. I am keeping it for something else. It's a good bag, quality construction... just too small for why I bought it. Would return it, except shipping is almost as much as bag cost. You know how THAT goes! Lesson learned: get the camera and accessories first, so you can see how much space you need, THEN order the bag."
4,Just fits a Canon HV20,"For some reason I thought the bag would be bigger. I looked at the measurements and didn't think that the dimensions would be on the outside, not the inner-lining where the camera sits. My Canon HV20 fits nice and snug inside. I can fit the battery charger and Firewire cord in the pockets...with some room for a few tapes, and maybe an extra battery or two. Not as much room for storage as I thought, but for the price and the ability to carry around the basics, it is a good deal. If you have a lot of peripherals, you will need a bigger bag."
3,really small,"I bought this case for my Panasonic mini DV camera, i was so disaapinted when i tried to fit my Ultra mini DV camera inside, it is very tiny, i could barely fit an extra mini DV tape, you will not be able to carry all the vedio accessory as the maker claims like battery charger, USB cable Etc...(i tried it and it would not close), i saw a better deal (cheaper and little bigger with side pockets) at Sam's club and i m going to buy it."
3,"Good bag, but not the right size","Good, little bag, but Amazon should not have recommended it for the Panasonic PV-GS85 MiniDV Camcorder. Device barely fits in the bag, and there is not much room for spare battery or tapes. If you bought the extra battery (also recommended), you will have to disengage it before putting camera in the bag."
4,Will Do,"We got it in good timing. The price is reasonable and made with what seems to be durable fabric. Fit a little snug, but will do. Like the small compartments."
2,A little bit bigger than I expected,"This bag is small compared with other bags. But it's big and chunky if compare with JVC HDD camcoder. It's impossible to chain on your belt as it's so bulky. The side pocket is too small, I can just fit in the remote."
3,Not quite what I wanted,"This dvd is old short, silent movies. I was hoping for the keystone cops who would drive in front of trains at ridiculous speeds, barely escaping, and guys falling off the back and just chaos in general. Wanted the grandkids to see that kind of behavior."
3,Deceptive Picture,I thought I was buying a two-pack of this item because of the picture. But it's a single bottle even though the description doesn't say that.I rate the product 5 stars and the vendor 1 star.
1,rip-off,"Don't order this product if you think you're getting two bottles. Only one bottle arrived and I'm having a wonderful time trying to get my refund. Fool me once, shame on you."
2,Prone to slipping,"I would agree with the other reviewers that it is prone to slipping unless you find a sink that matches its shape perfectly. The arms can technically fit a large variety of sinks, but the longer you extend them the less stable your cutting surface.Also, the bamboo surface will scratch heavily if you use reasonably sharp knives. The cutting surface itself is smaller than the picture would make you think.This might work well in some situations, such as cutting soft vegetables in small amounts, like for a stir-fry. But based on my experience I can't recommend it generally."
2,:-(,we got this because we LOVED the first 2 seasons but the 3rd season is more of a look back on the first 2 seasons with a few new episodes . we didnt like how they branched out of the area and thurgood just seemd diff. idk wasnt happy with this season . we will go ack to watching the first 2 again .
5,You can call me Jain~,"I've studied most religions over the years but could never embrace any of them because, after becoming a Vegan 3 years ago, didn't find them very loving towards all Sentient Beings or gave me the feeling that they knew worshiping leads to a form of slavery until i came back to Jainism. I ended up here again because of a stressful relationship i'm in now with someone who is my Polar, my Ying/Yang. And i don't have contact with my now very religious Xtian family anymore because i don't follow their Lord, their superstitions. My family today are mostly non-human beings, animals, plants, etc.. and a few good friends. This book fed my soul, for the author explained to me exactly what i've been looking for since i began my soul searching expedition years ago. I so thank you Michael Tobias for writing this very lovely, easy to read book!! I'm a Techno-Hippie that's now practicing Jainism, one who has always care about our Ecology and also loves Technology!"
2,I heard from the author,"The author of Back in the Daze contacted me last week. He assured me that the reviews were indeed ligit. I retract my statement, but still give the book 2 stars. It needs an overhauling. Back in the Daze has a good story line and a strong main character. It's destined to become a movie or play, but I don't see it winning an Oscar."
2,Main character is interesting,"I agree with the other reviews that the main character might make an interesting film choice for Halle Berry, Jade Pickett Smith or even Tamala Jones. However, as a literary agent, I'm accustomed to seeing all kinds of material being hyped by friends and phony reviews. It does not take a genius to figure out that all the Jan 23rd reviews were probaly written by one person. The material itself can stand on it's own two feet with the exceptions of a few passages. I won't go into detail about the book... it's worth taking a look at, so why spoil it for you? I will say, being born and raised in a similar Harlem environment, I can attest to the trueness of the main character's road to redemption. In comparison to the other works of the same genre, this book rates in the middle. It might be more interesting to see a stage play version of this work."
5,Absolutely one of the BEST(duh!) anime CD's out there!,"When it comes to making ENGLISH anime music counterparts to the JAPANESE originals, nobody can hold a torch to Pioneer and P-Anime! This is a great CD and definately one of my all-time favorites!"
3,Blade CX hardware problems,"This is a great remote heli. My biggest problems are the cheap plastic parts like the upper and lower rotor arms. They break very easy upon a heli crash. What's even a greater problem in my opinion is that these can be prevented.These parts can be replaced with aluminum parts that are stronger and will provide the ameture pilot with more fun time over down time.Why doesn't E-Flite sell the heli with these parts in the first place? I can't even get these parts today, they're all apparently on back-order.This is too bad. My son was excited on Christmas day, but is still waiting on back-ordered parts in mid January."
1,Cheap Junk,"I have both this and the Blade CP and neither work as advertised.I never got them more than a few feet off the ground with any control, they seem to go where they want, not where you want.They are supposed to be biginner's models but are extremely fragile. They won't survive even a mild crash such as dropping a few feet. You can't learn if you can't try more than once."
3,Difficult access,"Like others have said, this pack's degree of access is hampered by it's design. Not ideally suited for quick in and outs. Probably more of a 'base camp'-style pack. The suspension is adjustable for different torso lengths, but at the tall end, the shoulder straps hang outside the pads which can rub one's shoulders.Despite these negatives, it's a large pack that can carry a bunch of gear, dust- and moisture-free. And that's no small thing."
2,A confusing maze with far too much irrelevant chatter,"While this book contains most of the information one needs it's hard to get through the confusing maze of silly stories and irrelevant chatter to find what you are looking for. as a double MCNE with a teaching background, I have managed to get some 20 people through their CNE training using this book, not because it's the best or even good, but because up until recently there was no alternative. I am desperately looking to replace it as a reference text."
4,Good deal,Haven't read it but am anxious to do so. It arrived on timeand in good shape. I am pleased with the service.
5,Lafuma Kid Sleeping Bag GReat buy!,This is by far the best childrens sleeping bag we've bought yet. Great product for a great price.
3,From Back Cover,"The last thing Sam Schaffer wants to do is turn Crystal Peterson into eye candy for someone else. But she doesn't want to hear how hot Sam thinks she is. So he agrees to make her into a new, sensual Crystal. The results are like something out of his wildest dreams. And when she asks him for lessons in seduction, well, there's no way he's turning that invitation down!Crystal will trust only Sam to do her transformation from tomboy to sex goddess. She just wants to get one man's attention. Yet as Sam dresses her, all she can think of is him undressing her! With his eyes on her, she feels sexier than ever. And when he finally puts his hands on her, she's not thinking of anyone else! But she has to convince Sam that she now has eyes only for him..."
5,Stax,"Saw it - loved it - buying it.As a white kid of the 60's growing up with all that great Stax music, it was great to see some of those artists I loved on the PBS version of this DVD.Thank you to whomever put this show out on this DVD. It transcends race and shows you what can happen when people - black and white - can make music for the love of music.Doesn't have everybody, but what you have on this DVD is just something you have to own for when we all get older and want to remember.Buy it - you'll love it.Don't - you'll regret it.It's a piece of music history that's lost in all the bogus black ""artists"" of today.They can't hold a candle to the true artists on this DVD."
5,Superbly done,"Few of the Stax artists were to my taste, but this is the best documentary I've ever seen about modern pop music. It is musically and historically fascinating. It tells the story of Stax clearly and concisely, eliciting relevant commentary from the most important living participants. Even if you are not a great fan of Stax music, this is well worth watching."
4,Great Find,"I saw this originally on PBS and was happy to find it on Overstock. This video gives a lot of history about Stax records and brings back memories of when vinyl 45's cost less than a $1. Truly a good find to have in your DVD collection for all of those ""soul"" lovers out there."
1,Errors in syntax and coding,I agree with Miguel. This is not a good book to get started in ActionScript. There are too many explanations with holes in them that make the whole learning process even more difficult and confusing experience. Too many typos and half harted tutorials. Do not waste your money.
3,Part # correction TIMKEN Part # 7692S for the M5R2 T-bird 5spd.,Part # correction TIMKEN Part # 7692S for the M5R2 T-bird 5spd.Part # correction TIMKEN Part # 7692S for the M5R2 T-bird 5spd.
1,Buyer Be Very Wary,"The trusted leader in children's learning really blew it with this product. I bought SS Baby deluxe, SS Preschool and SS Toddler for my 2 and 4 year olds. My little girl was SO excited to play these games but Uh-oh. The small print says several of the disks DON'T WORK on Windows 2000 and they were developed for XP before the program was released so it is shaky on XP machines too. The bottom line - we can't run most of the CD's - some will install but not play. Some won't give the sound, some won't install. Very disappointing. Also Encore (who produces product) says on their web that they don't do refunds - you have to go back to the original store. Also they don't have an 800 toll-free number so you have to pay for support calls. NOT WHAT I EXPECTED FROM SESAME STREET. I WILL BE VERY WARY OF ALL THEIR PRODUCTS NOW."
5,Superbly inspirational book!,"Kathleen Noble has written an absolutely outstanding book for women! This book is both eye-opening and inspiring. Noble points out that while we are at times virtually inundated with examples of male heroes, examples of the female hero can be few and far between. She tells both her own story and those of other women, and in the doing, gives faces to true female heroes. She also lays out a veritable bluprint for women to reclaim their own heroism and truly chart their own path. I return to this book again and again, and recommend it to all intelligent women!"
5,Real Music!,"""No Time Like The Present"" is undiscovered gold. Mark Pont's talent as a writer, singer and producer really shines, and is one of the best independent releases I've heard in a long time. His unique approach to blue eyed soul is refreshing and energetic. Well worth the listen."
4,Delivered Inspiration,I purchased this book for a friend of mine who is in jail awaiting trial. He loved these stories and finished the book within a couple days. He is now starting to accept and keep an open mind to see all the changes he needs to make in his life when he returns to society one day. I am glad I ordered this for him.
3,It was a gift,"It was a gift for someone else & I have not read it. My friend said that it was OK, so."
5,wonderful book!,"I bought this for my son who is in a detention center; unfortunately, I was not allowed to send this, so instead I started reading. There are so many good stories and encouraging pieces in here, that everyone should read it. I highly recommend it."
2,This brush just didn't work well for my dogs.,I found this brush difficult to use and my dogs really struggled when I tried to use it.
3,difficult,hard to put together It was a Christmas gift...afraid my husband has lost interest and it has not been compleeted. I will give him a little push soon.
5,awesomeness,Havent used it yet but i bought it for my brother for Christmas after his knee surgery and he said it was awesome
2,Telescope,"Very disappointed. Bought this thinking we would see craters on the moon, not so. It was very complicated getting it set up. I would start a child on a cheaper scope because when it doesn't work they loose interest."
1,Horrible! Completely misleading...,"The cheesy 2x2 insert with 'instructions' specifically tells me I will find 4 programs on the DVD.....yet I have only three and the 'web-only' version at the manufacturer's site makes no mention of it....gives the appearance that it was a problem child that they just eliminated rather than supported. Further, the screen shots on the box, are in no way similar to the sophmoric and low grade interface and illustrations that I just installed. This is the crap you get when you buy on impulse......don't get this software....it's garbage!"
2,"Useful, but...","This universal remote works fairly well with all the devices I've tried it on, except devices that are newer than the remote itself. However, it is missing one key feature that would have stopped me from ever buying it if I had known ahead of time: You cannot reassign a device function to control a different type of device. This missing feature becomes a flaw when you find out that if you want to control a component CD player, you have to use the DVD device button and you can no longer control a DVD player with it."
1,terrible,"This was terrible. First , it is very dry. It has no gloss to it , very matte. Second , I ordered light Blonde and the color that came was Blonde/light brown. I was looking for a pale , golden , color. This looked like foundation that you put on your face. A dull tan. I got it for highlights and it made my hair look like I had makeup smeared in it . Ugh."
3,Not Lion (OSX 10.7) Compatable,"I've had a number of these keyboards and really love them. Unfortunately when I added one to my new iMac with OSX Lion, the 'special' keys don't work and the driver is not Lion compatible. After a few emails to Macally, I get the feeling they are not interested in updating their drivers on this keyboard for Lion. It is really sad, there aren't that many Mac keyboards out there, and apparently even less that work with Lion."
4,imac owner,"I bought this as a replacement for the aluminum keyboard that came with my new imac. The Macally is definitely easier to type on and better matches my imac's black trim. Keys are a bit stiff but I think I'll be able to adjust in short order. If you're used to a typical PC desktop keyboard you might be disappointed with this Macally, but if you're currently using the new imac keyboard, this keyboard will be a godsend."
1,incompetent translation,"I am looking for the best translation of this novel for my students. This translation of Catherine Hutter is utterly incompetent. Example: ""I have spoken to my aunt and must say that I didn't find her to be the dreadful vehement woman with the kindest of hearts."" The German reads: ""Ich habe meine Tante gesprochen und bei weitem das boese Weib nicht gefundet, das man bei uns aus ihr macht. Sie ist eine muntere, heftige Frau von dem besten Herzen"" = ""I have spoken to my aunt and found her to be not at all the dreadful woman she is made out to be among us. She is a cheerful, energetic woman with the best of hearts."""
3,Not what I expected,"This is a handy little book, but I was disappointed that it does not include tree shapes or pictures of bark."
1,No English Subtitles,"It's 100% in Korean, no English subtitlespretty frustrating considering what it cost, $30So buyer beware buying this through Amazon, if you can understand Koreanthen perhaps it's worth itbut without even English Subtitles, for us.......it stinks"
4,Stability,Stable on our concrete basement floor- no rocking. Easy to assemble too... my son put it together.
3,As far as greatest hits packages go...,"As far as greatest hits packages go this one has alot more misses than ""hits"", stay with the original three albums of which this release is representitive of, Last Exit, Traffic and Dear Mr.Fantasy, also of interest might be John Barleycorn, Blind Faith and Welcome to the Canteen."
5,Very good cleanser,I like this cleanser because it is not greasy and washes off easily and has a pleasant subtle smell.It leaves my face feeling softer.
5,Excellent preparation for the EMT-Basic exam,"Well-planned chapters and abundant illustrations make this text accessible, even to those without previous knowledge of science/medicine. The charts walk you through procedures step-by-step, and mastery of them is crucial to passing your practical exam. The questions at the end of the chapters helped in prepping for exams. Note however, that you should defer to your instructors for information pertaining to state and local protocols - these vary by area, and may have changed since the book was published."
4,Violette Noziere and The Girl from Paris,"Violette - deserved the Cannes Best Actress award. Isabelle Huppert floored me with her portrayal of a young lady trying her best to escape the ravages of a controlling parent. She comes across as not a vindictive person but one caught in the throes of a life that one needs desperately to escape. Consequences be damned, she must set her world aright.The Girl from Paris - I had never seen Mathilde Seigner act before now. I thought she did a super job of portraying one who desires to escape from an urban lifestyle and take up the seemingly quaint lifestyle of a farmer. She learns along the way that things don't occur easily. When something needs to built, cared for, repaired and nurtured, the farmer is the sole source of comfort and skill. One learns not to rely on the outside for assistance but to care for onself, care for the animals, and deal with one's loneliness."
4,My review,"I am grossly underqualified to write a 'review' of a Vic Chesnutt CD. All I can do is compare it to some of his other releases. (I've not listened to anything that came before Is The Actor Happy, or the Widespread Panic collaborations).Zippy Morocco; In My Way, Yes; 2nd Floor; Sultan, So Mighty; and Styrofoam are as good as anything I've heard by Vic. The lyrics throughout are great, as to be expected.I deduct one star because the transitions into the harder rocking passages on 2nd Floor, Band Camp and Wrens Nest aren't nearly as comfortable sounding as the seamless transitions that appear on 'Actor' (Free of Hope, Strange Language) or About To Choke (Degenerate, Giant Sands)."
4,What a ride!,"The Gray Stopgap is a roller coaster of action and emotion. Karns is a complex character who kept me turning the page wondering what he'd do next. His love story is bitter - and not just a backdrop to all the government intrigue and deception - this love story examines the results of when things go tragically wrong.The adventure alone is well thought out and intricate. Being a native Washingtonian, I especially appreciated the local references. A lot of research must have gone into the making of this book, but more importantly to me, Tolleson really gets into the souls of his characters and makes them believable - making all of their misfortune and grandiose adventure both heartbreaking and irresistible.This would make the perfect movie (with Pierce Brosnan as Karns!) - I hope there's a sequel!"
4,Parabath Paraffin Wax Bath,It is serving the purpose I bought it for. I have arthritis in my hands and while it dosen't cure my hands. I get some relief from the hot wax.
1,misleading advertisements,I was searching for a large type book of the current Prayer Book which the ad indicated that this was. What I received as a standard edition of the 1928 version.
2,Phone Tools,"The phone tools say it's compatible with my phone. My phone responds perfectly to the software and can connect with the computer, but the software does not give me any option to upload games, ringtones, or any pictures to my phone. Same the other way around. I cannot even transfer files from my phone to my computer. All i can do is syncronize the addressbook with that of my computer."
1,phoneTools the worst ever,"Hard to believe that Motorola would put their name on such garbage:Recurrent events fill up all daysDaylight time arbitrarily syncs one hour early or lateAlarm alerts change to thousands of minutesSome events simply skipped, others replicated endlesslyContacts shuffled numbers/typesSLOW SLOW SLOWThis is not sync software, it's just TRASH. Don't even THINK about wasting your time and money on this manure. Like a previous reviewer said, too bad there's no zero-star rating. Negative would be even better."
3,It's okay,"My daughter received this for her first birthday. It's really cute and she likes the vibrating, but truthfully I've probably played with it more than she has. The switches are tiny and have to be pressed with a moderate amount of pressure. My daughter hasn't been able to indpendently make it work. She wants to be independent and isn't really interested in hand over hand help so this toys gets limited play time."
2,Elmo and Cookie Monster Giggle Ball loses...,"My 18 month-old son received this as a Christmas gift. I don't know why this is marketed for children 18 months and older. It is heavy and is like carrying around a small cloth-covered bowling ball. It is so difficult to push the ball in order to get it to vibrate and make sounds. If I can hardly get it to respond, how can an 18 month-old child? Occasionally, it will just vibrate non-stop and won't do anything else. The giggling and vibrations are entertaining--but only for so long. I cannot recommend this toy to anyone..."
3,Decent for the price,"Purchased this as my first ""real"" humidor. Finish and built is nice. One problem was that the hygrometer it came with didn't work. I followed the instructions on how to calibrate it but the needle never moved and it seemed pretty cheaply-made overall. It would also be nice if this came with a cedar divider or two to separate your collection. Otherwise, a good humidor for the price, especially as someone's first."
4,A Beautiful but Sad Farewell,"Tragedy befell this band in spades, and as the life expectancy of this group wound down, they somehow found what it took to create a beautiful, if sad farewell. The eagle that flew had a certain life force for them, and when you think how soon after this Chris Wood was gone, it is a bit heartbreaking.But Steve Winwood, Jim Capaldi, Chris Wood were in absolutely brilliant form for this. ""Dream Gerrard"" and the title track are songs for the ages. By this time, Winwood and Capaldi were really becoming adept in the studio, and you'll find a load of sonic gems throughout this remastered disc. This is nearly essential if you are a Winwood fan, and absolutely so if Traffic inspired you. This was their Abbey Road."
4,Excellent and overlooked swan song,"For all the accolade that their first album has received over the years, this album is actually much better, more mature and infinitely better produced than their debut. I compares favorably with their classic second album, in fact. The longer songs have been criticized, but I actually think they give the album a wonderful ambience, particularly Dream Gerard. I loved the album when it came out, and I remember sharing it with friends, all of whom loved it. So there must be something there.If you like Winwood and have not heard this album, you are more than likely depriving yourself of a very enjoyable listening experience. Hope it gets a domestic release someday...I am still listening to my old LP!"
5,"Something new, and something great","I'd just like to echo all of the reviewers' thoughts. WTEF is pure brilliance in a different way than Traffic's previous releases, and although it may not be their ""best"" work for some reason it always finds its way to my stereo before the others."
3,Would be better if...,"I bought this CD only after a reviewer reported below that ""the sound is excellent."" The sound is not excellent. It reminds me of Albert King's 1967 Fillmore West recordings. The sound is very bright. Fred Barnes's cat quick bass licks lack any low end. This CD sounds best played in my car where the recording's high frquency bias isn't as noticable.That being said, it is a satisfying performance. Especially with Eric Clapton featured on three of the nine tracks and Clapton and Luther Allison on a fourth."
4,This recording shows that the band split up far too soon.,Released shortly after brilliant tour of June 1991. Their valedictory album is superb and the only disappointment is that the potential to go further was missed when the band prematurely split.
3,Worth the info,"Poorly written, very poorly edited, but well worth the information conveyed. With better writing and editing, it obviously could've been a better read, but the details given about politics in movie studios and the excesses of life in 1980's Hollywood make the book worth purchasing regardless. Almost entirely, the book doesn't hold back. It names names, places, and dirty deeds done. Author doesn't seem to have any personal vendettas against Hollywood or Simpson and therefore the book reads relatively objectively. Fleming pretty much criticizes everyone equally, while also finding time for some sparse praise."
2,"Great concept, terrible book!",This is a book that needed to be written. Too bad it wasn't written right. It's so scatershot and poorly constructed/edited that just reading it can be a chore at times. One also wonders how much was researched and how much was just a collection of gossip. There are far better books out there about what's wrong with Hollywood---but maybe the question this book raises is What's wrong with book publishing? Once a respectable company like Doubleday wouldn't have been caught dead doing this.
2,A Carnival of the Grotesque,"The word ""genius"" can have very little meaning indeed if it can be used repeatedly and with a straight face (as it is in this book) to describe a producer of insipid films, who coincidentally, was a man of matchless grossness. A squalid, depressing read which left me feeling soiled and tainted for days."
4,Great movie,"About the movie RED LINE. is terrific. The director makes a movie each 20 years. But it worths. And what is more impressive, he shows ,before each scene, a view , a particularly view of the nature. Showing us that no matter what happens to the human being, the nature is always in it's course. I guess he had the intention to show the nature as a distant God, besides the reference of Homer (in ILIADA). The Cel. studied or liked Homer. All the actors are splendid in their rules. The war is showned as cruel as it is. And the soldiers are not brave, and they are so frightned. It's the opposite o SOLDIER RYAN AND THE MONKEYS"
2,Review of Mason's Retreat by Christopher Tilghman,"I grew up on the Delmarva Peninsula and enjoyed Christopher Tilghman's writing about the Chesapeake Bay, so I was interested in reading Mason's Retreat. However, the book was very sad and depressing. I did something that I rarely do - I did not finish the book because it was so depressing. While I thoroughly enjoyed the description of a sea voyage which happens at the beginning of the book and the descriptions of Chesapeake Bay life, I simply had no interest in reading an unrelentingly depressing novel about a failure of a man who managed to cause amazing suffering to his family and truth be told, everyone around him."
1,There is only one layer,"This glove looked pretty, however, it is useless especially when there is only one layer of it. My friend bought an identical glove with one layer of ragg, and a layer of cotton inside which made the glove comfortable and warm. However, this glove is only one layer, when strong wind heats, you felt like your hand is naked and frozen."
1,Piece of Junk,"I purchased the Stebel Nautilus, chrome version, approx. 4 months ago. It quit working last month. I also know of four other people who purchased these and they also failed. In addition the chrome finish on the plastic body is now a dull gray color. Our local Harley dealer quit selling them when they had failure rates in excess of 80 %. Just a piece of Junk!!!!"
3,Great Music for the advanced skier,"This is fast, driving music! I certainly don't think this ablum is anything near great and I wish there were not as many vocals in the first songs.As a 59 year old skier I like to put on an Ipod and ski to the fast beat of the music. This requires a skier to be a dark blue to black run in ability due to turning with the beat. If you listen to this music on a green slope you will be warned that you are speeding by the Patrol. I must also stress this music is great for long or ""quick"" road trips too.Oakenfold could have done much better, but the music is worth listening to!"
3,Less Than I Expected,"This product contained less than I expected in terms of behavioral images. This is geared more toward children/adults with autism and less for Aspergians. The images provided are probably wonderful for someone who has trouble with self-help (i.e., dressing, brushing teeth, etc.), but aren't what I expected for things like ""don't talk,"" ""raise your hand,"" or ""sit in the chair."""
1,From the backlist? Not always a good idea,"If this book illuminates anything, it shows how very far Ms.Roberts has progressed as a writer.It was an annoying book and, in places, barely tolerable.I am a fan, and want to shake her editors for not culling this one as someone is now hungrily hunting her attic for more books (really?) to sell."
2,A beginner's book,"I had higher expectations, particularly from a book by R.C. I found this to be a brief broad brush on the dark side of Islam. It walked lightly into the ""dark side"" but didn't get to the more serious bits or implications. Frankly, I was disappointed. However, it may be a good starter book for those who want to just learn something about Islam and then head off to other more robust books on the topic should they have further interest. There are much better introductory treatments of the subject out there. Patrick Sookhdeo is a good alternative: Global Jihad; The Challenge of Islam to the Church and Its Mission; and A Christian's Pocket Guide To Islam."
5,this works well,"I almost rated this with four stars because I had a problem finding the plug in on the front of the unit so that I could start the minivan after loading the chicken, cheeses,salad items but realized it was probably as much my fault as the designers of the cooler/warmer.I could do without the radio but I can see if you were at the beach or tailgating it might be a handy item so I disallowed my own prejudices.It works fine. If it saves one person from salmonella it is well worth it!"
3,its better than nothing,"for the price, the fridge is ok. It is better than not having a fridge. The glue on the plastic material is liable to melting in a hot car. It takes longer to cool the interior on hot days. The adjustable temperature setting is way too loose. Don't bother to use the radio. And watch the container box, the fridge can fall out when carrying it with it. Wall AC adapter is not included in the box."
3,"Works fine, for being wrong","Ran the test on it, especially since it tells you not to. It's off by five points to the light side. As long as I remember that 65%. =. 70%. I'll be alright. I guess it works ok. It holds steady so that's a plus."
2,Hygrometer will not calibrate,"Used Boveda One-Step Calibration Kit (ordered at the same time) to calibrate the hygrometer, and it is off by 6% (reads 71% when calibrated to 77%). There is no way to re-calibrate this unit, so I will be returning it and purchasing another type of hygrometer, which is hopefully more accurate."
1,Wildly inaccurate,I bought the Caliber III and I also bought a Planet Waves Hygrometer. I took them both to a Guitar Center and went into their controlled humidity acoustic guitar room. That room also had two hygrometers in it. None of the four had the same humidity read-out which brings into question the accuracy of all of the units. The Caliber III was the worst of all. On the same day in went from 23% to 55% humidity readings when there was no change in weather (and the Planet Waves hygrometer didn't swing nearly this wildly) and in the guitar room it was the furthest away from the other three hygrometers which were in a range from 42% to 45% to 50%. The Caliber III read out at 55%. I would not trust this unit to accurately portray the relative humidity in any environment.
2,Reading Always Off,"I have six of these, and not one of them reads correctly. They range from 6%-11% off. I have to keep adding and subtracting and keeping track of which is which. Also, there is no setting to change the reading if it turns out it is off, hence the headache."
2,I have two. One is hit and miss,"I have two of these. Initially i set them up in the same space and found that they are + or - two difference on the temp and or humidity.After about a weeks use in separate spaces i found that on of the units displays ""--%"" for the humidity for much of the time. Customer service were not helpful at all."
4,"Good, control buttons iffy","Tested it with salt test - passed. The control buttons are not very responsive - gotta press them several times sometimes. Not sure about the high and low recordings though, the high once read 103F and I am damn sure it was not the hot in my room ever during the winter. Good for humidors, not designed to be used for rooms."
3,Engaging,"I have always dreamed of hiking the Appalachian Trail and this small pearl of a book gave me insight into Cynthia Ross' journey from Georgia to Maine. Her detailed sketches reveal as much as her journal entries, especially in the expressive faces of herself and her companions. I particularly enjoyed her accounts of encounters with residents living near the Trail who provide food, shelter, and sustanence to many hikers. If I never reach my goal, at least I have had the opportunity to vicariously share Ms. Ross' experience."
1,The Toms,This is quite possibly the worst CD I have ever spent money on. Save yours and don't purchase it!
4,little one loves it!,"This was given to my 20 month old as a gift. She loves to hold it against her tummy while it ""giggles"" and makes vibrations and she'll erupt into laughter! It was fun to watch her figure out the separate faces and that they each said different things.It's been very durable, as she likes to throw around anything that looks even remotely like a ball for the dog to chase. It's still giggling as good as ever even after many rough contacts with the floor and some dog slobber, as well as my wiping it down afterwards to rid it of dog slobber.I am sorry to hear about the other reviewer's issue with it's safety. We've had absolutely no problems with Bert and Ernie's safety in our house; we've just had lots of laughs and smiles!"
5,awesome tribute,I love teenage fanclub they are one of my favorite groups and this is a great tribute with a bunch of different groups and singers covering their songs. I would highly recomend this for any teenage fan club fans.
1,HUGE PRICE INCREASE WITHIN 24 HR!!!,"Ok, the listed price is $35, but the selling price is $99???? I just looked at this yesterday and it was listed for $18...what on earth happened w/in a 24 hr period?????"
3,Wave Clips,"Even though I knew the clips were aluminum I was expecting something a little heavier. Product works fine, though and I receive desired results. Price for value is fair."
4,nice collection,"This is a good collection of Wesley passages into nice categories. The passages chosen are from a wide range of sources and of time periods in Wesley's life. However, the book is 98% Wesley. The editors let Wesley speak for himself on lots of issues. While this is nice to a certain extent, some direction following each passage would've been good. It's nice to have some analysis with this kind of work. At the end, there's a handy reference of the passages used, and at the end of every chapter (category), there's a list of supplementary resources if you're interested in reading more. I'd highly recommend this book. Some very interesting and worthwhile reading here."
3,el otro language-o,"I saw El Otro Yo on MTV Spanish playing No Me Importa Morir and I was blown away by how tight, catchy and loud they were. Then I went to the band's web site and heard Sexo en Elevador. Here are some lyrics roughly translated: ""I don't want an inflateable wrist, i want a girl."" You may not understand the lyrics, them being in Spanish, but who cares when a band is this catchy. They use the soft loud dynamic, but not in a cheap Silverchairish way, more like a big singalong New ...happy way. And if you don't think that Spanish can be punk instead of melodromatic, listen to the Pixies and the Clash, fool."
3,meh,nice socks. more cushion than regular socks. i just was hoping for MORE cushion to lessen the impact of dancing/jumping without shoes.
4,Super thick and comfortable!,"These socks are really comfortable and the padding parts on the heel and the toes are very thick. When I put these socks on I went oooohhhhh! Seriously, they are extremely warm, comfortable, and plush. On a side note, I'm just wearing these around the house not actually hiking!"
1,too small,"I selected the size 10 (shoe size 7-9) sock and it is way to short (I am a size 7.5 to 8). I thought it might stretch after wear but it did not and it leaves my toes uncomfortable cramped inside my hiking boot. It seems like a good quality sock, I just wish the sizing was more accurate."
5,Love this ring!,"My husband and I love this ring! Not only does it symbolize our love, but we dont have to worry about taking off an expensive piece of jewelry every time we wash dishes, or pull weeds! This seller was fantastic. I really really enjoyed this shopping experience!"
5,brilliant!!!,"Salon Victoria's debut CD ""Locos Y Rucas in Retro"" is by far one of the best albums i've ever heard. The diversity in this record is very unique, one moment you're hearing ska, the next you're hearing swing, then some mambo and then before you know it some hardcore punk comes in! The 11 musicians that make up this band are truly talented. The drummer, Cheko Mendoza could easily replace the drummer of Rush!Stand out tracks on this album are: ""Nasty Uncle Hippy"", ""Satanas Swing"", ""Fandango Allende"" (the tale of Chile's slain leader), ""Pozoñas Surf"" ""Ciudad Sin Guerra"" (which talks about getting drunk in a romantic version of Mexico City), and ""La Noche Estaba Puesta"".This album is a masterpiece, a must have if you're looking for something unique and refreshing.Recommended for fans of ska, swing, punk, rockabilly, mambo, tango and just good music in general."
5,Why?,"Every store around me just all of a sudden dropped it off the shelves. Do you know why? I don't-it works so well for me. The pharmacist said it's been discontinued, which baffles me.... I'm glad Amazon has it, but I'd much rather go to the drug store to pick it up."
2,Didn't work for me,"I tried this for a week and while the ointment caused my scaly skin to be removed easily, the scales would be back just as thick the next day."
4,Hey Culligan Man,"I have installed two of the Culligan under sink water filters, one in my home and one in my son's home. I would recommened buying just the filter and attachment and a watts faucet vs. the kit though. The kit has plastic parts and if you go to Menards or Home Depot you can get Watts standard fittings and connectors to do it yourself that are not plastic, they will also carry the plastic water line as well.It is easy to install and the water tastes great.On another note: The second filter and attachment I purchase leaked but Amazson made it easy to get a replacement and the second one was there in a couple of days. They are easy to work with on returns. Good customer service.My son likes his filter system as well."
4,kit,very easy to install my vents using this product yyy yyy yyy yyy yyy yyy yyy yyy yyy yyy yyy yyy yy yyy yyy
3,t60x,just bought one of these this past weekend. so far its a good product. i use it for sampling from vinyl to the mpc1k. works out fine for me.
3,RG-59 Cable,It is cable. What more can you say. It does the job and the price was right. I'm satisfied with it.
4,As a family member,"I was sad to find out about this book shortly after the passing of my grand-farther Judge T. Reed II, son of Judge T. Reed & grand-son of Elijah Reed.My Grandfather's sunrise was on May 14 1904 and it set Jan 3 2004, a man who achieved more in his early years than I can ever accomplish in my life time.This documented journey has been in my possession for a few years, but I've been hesitant to take for many obvious reasons. Haven taking the first steps, I want to run to the finish line with excitement and pride.Regardless of where are family lines (yours & mine) start, cross or end it is how we stand now that makes us accountable for the legacy our children will judge us by in the future.If you have not started to build your foundation do it now. It is never too late to build a strong legacy for our children to be proud of."
3,Predictable,"Coming of age flick involving some 25 year olds who discover that getting married ain't so bad after all. The usual deadbeat dad makes an appearance, someone's pregnant, someone's a lesbian, someone is a jerk, and, oh yeah, there's plenty of gratuitous naked flesh. Does the plot make sense? Yes, such as it is. I have no idea what the title means, though. Worth watching, but not urgently."
5,JG 26 Wardiary is a well-written and detailed account.,"Don Caldwell has once again shown himself to be a top researcher and writer. His meticulous delving into the Luftwaffe history of JG 26 is entertaining and informative. Whether the reader is a historian or a casual reader interested in aviation history, this is an excellent read!"
5,awesome purchase,I love this gift. this was an awesome purchase and exactly what I was looking for and shipped fast! excellent!
4,muy bueno,funciona muy bueno filtra bien el agua y los peces estan feliz y yo tambien de que el agua este bien
2,OK filter if you don't mind dead fish,"It's an okay filter in that it does a good job of keeping the tank clean, and it is very quiet. However, if you have small fish, they will get stuck in it and they will die. I actually couldn't find one in the tank one night and then saw him struggling to get out of the place where the cord sticks in on the side. After I turned off the filter, he managed to get out, but was injured and died the next day. I've lost a number minnows because of this filter since I started my tank up two months ago and I'm going to be replacing it with an external filter very soon."
1,Shot water out of the tank onto the wall.,"The filter was constructed very cheaply but seemed to work well for about a week. Then it started shooting water out the back, over the top of the tank, and onto the wall. My son caught it before there was major damage to the wall and floor, but I had to clean over a gallon of fish water out of the carpet in my boy's room and missed the first quarter of the 49rs game."
4,John Deere Stool,"The stool was delivered quickly. It was a good deal for $29.95.We are very happy with it and the quick service.Thank You,J. Swaney"
1,Made in China,"Sears is making them in China now, and they're absolute junk. Don't be a sucker like I was--stick with American-made tools and you won't end up with rounded nuts, broken wrenches, and busted knuckles."
4,"Italian pop star of the 80's, 90's and beyond!","Umberto Tozzi belongs in the Italian pop stars Hall of Fame. His album ""EVA"" represents another great musical achievement by combining all the necessary ingredients to take the listener into Tozzi's world of romance and seduction. When Tozzi sings, Italian listen because he trully has a great voice. Not an ""opera"" voice but the kind of voice you would imagine Italian men ideally need to have when sereneding women. This album has a 80's feel to it but most songs and melodies in it are timeless. Tozzi's music and lyrics reflect the sensibility and passion found in Italian culture but without sounding cliche. This album is worth your investment."
3,Satisfied,"Although I was misled in the edition of the book. I received it in a timely fashion. I can blame myself for not checking further in the edition. Will not order unless there is a picture provided (lol). Other than my own blames, great Service. Arrived in timely fashion. Would do business again. Thanks!!!"
5,great first novel,"This book is an emotional ride. It begins with a horrible crime of gay bashing motivated by self-hate and fear, which leaves the victim dead and the perpetrators dealing with the consequences. The main character, Michael, is racked with guilt and haunted by dreams of the victim. A shadowy organization steps in to right the wrong done to one of its own, abducting Michael to punish him for his actions. What follows is a tale with plenty of plot twists and interesting characters to carry the story along quickly. Michael's character is what really makes this an interesting read. He is someone you can care about and the story unfolds through his eyes. This is a great first book and the sequels only add to the depth of the story. Mr. Lawson's creates an intriguing look into the world of S"
5,Get Ready to be Hearing a Lot About these Guys!,"This is an awesome CD! It is instantly catchy and you'll find yourself singing the often quirky lyrics all day. Lottery Winners On Acid instantly puts me in a good mood whenever I listen to it! One of my top ten of the year, definitely! The only drawback is that it's only an EP with 5 songs... I need more!"
2,You On a Diet,I was a little dissapointed in this item. It was a very general outline of weight loss and not the detailed information I had hoped for.
2,ok,"this didnt cost too much, so i cant expect much i guess. it works marginally, but does not truly support your back or shoulders enough to correct posture."
4,Picture Frame,I love this product! I have been searching for a photo frame with baby's monthly milestones and this one is perfect. I would recommend it to anyone. It even has a place to engrave your baby's name.
3,Merenguealo with Merenhits '99!,"""Las mujeres lo estan bailando"" - con el ritmo de La Makina. Los hombres estan diciendo ""Ki Ki Ki"" cuando bailan el ritmo de Rikarena. Y tu tambien puedes bailarlo ""suavemente"". No pierdas el tiempo y compralo ya!"
5,An excellent self-study resource and a great reference on biostatistics,"This is a very helpful text for biostatistics. It covers a wide variety of topics and statistical tests which are commonly used in statistical inference and analysis of biological data. It includes very in-depth discussion on the use of different tests with illustrated examples that walked you all the way through. It is truly a great reference and an excellent self-study book on biostatistics.As another reviewer mentioned before, Bayesian statistics, bootstrap methods, and analysis of experiments with missing data are not covered in the 4th edition, which is the edition I have for this book. It would have been nice to include these topics in the latest edition, which I believe is 5th edition came out in 2009. Perhaps I will dig into it and see if there is any big difference/update between 4th and 5th editions of this great biostatistics text."
2,Concise but not beginner friendly,"This book is very concise and very mathemically based. It does a good job at presenting the mathematical models of statistics but it does a lousy job at explaining biostatistics in a conceptual manner. Maybe a great book for those who love mathemical models and notations but definitely not recommended for someone who is trying to understand biostatistics conceptually. If you are a scientist with a weak bacdground in statistics, you may find it a waste of time to try to understand this book."
1,Made in China,I thought I was buying a mug made in USA. I found the Made in China tag on the bottom and sent it back.
2,"Ya, don't buy this thing.",The idea is sound but in practicality it does not work. The center menu button either does not catch or gets stuck down. It also attracts a lot of lint on it. You would be much better off going with a pouch case that you can take it out of when you want to use it.
