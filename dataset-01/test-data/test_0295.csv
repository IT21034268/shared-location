4,Just make sure you get the right coffee,"this is a great machine - easy to use; no mess; easy to fill the water reservoir. The one disadvantage with the K cups is you can't control brew strength. I was disappointed in the weak coffee it seemed to brew (even on the smallest cup setting) until a friend told me to make sure to buy ""extra bold"" K cups to ensure the kind of coffee I'm used to drinking. That seemed to do the trick."
1,Bad Costumer Service,"After four months my Keurig didn't work anymore. I contacted Costumer service by e-mail and phone and no answer after two months. Do not buy this product, if anything goes wrong, you will be with a broken item without refund nor replacement. I ended up using my regular coffee maker due to the lack of service of Keurig Company."
5,I could use a cup right now,"Good stuff. I was worried when purchasing as I heard Keurigs can break down. So far I'm not disappointed. K cups are a bit expensive, but buying the reuseable filter that you can put whatever coffee you want in it is great. Good purchase!"
2,Unreliable!,"This product is very unreliable. It worked just fine for about a month and then it would always say Prime and when that went away, it says it's Ready To Brew, but does not actually brew. It seems like a lot of people have similar problems. Very disappointing for how much it costs."
4,brew station,"It's okay. Expensive but convenient to use. It does require some planning on where to plug in as it uses a considerable amount of energy in a short time and if one is using another appliance, the circuit can trip. I am a little concerned that the plastic containers left after each cup can not be reused. I used to compost the used coffee grounds but have not been able to do so with the new system. It does not make a good, man-size cup of coffee with its one measure."
5,The best,I've read all the reviews and can't say enough about this coffee maker. One thing I didn't see mentioned was how quickly it works. We can make 10 different cups of coffee in less time than it takes to brew a single pot in our old coffee maker.
2,makes pathetic coffee,"Had a strong plastic 'fake' taste to everything it brewed. It took about 50 large cups of water-flushes and 3 vinegar rinses to finally make it start brewing 'acceptable' tasting coffee. Then after all that, it does what it is supposed to, which is brew an underwhelming cup of coffee at 50 cents per disposable coffee cartridge.Medium is about maximum size you should brew, large is just water.After 48 k-cups plus the samplers, I have sold it to my coworker who wanted it for his desk for 1/3rd the price. Good riddance."
1,Don't buy a Keurig model B60,"There is a flaw in the construction of Kerurig B60 coffee maker. It will plug up and stop making coffee, even through you have followed all of the cleaning instructions. The one I have failed after three months of daily use. Kerurig customer support is less than helpful, claiming that you must have used bad water in the coffee maker. I even used bottled water, and it still stopped up. Keurig should not be able to market this model.I have a different model and it has worked for over two years without any problems. I yet to clean it, and I use straight tap water."
3,"Good, expected more choices","There was about 6 or 7 choices, many not coffee. It was a good start, but I would like it better if it were ALL coffee and not tea or hot chocolate."
2,Very Noisy,"I recently bought the B50 machine. A few of my friends had them and enjoyed the convenience, hang the extra cost. Since my husband hasn't been drinking much coffee lately, I decided to treat myself. The machine is very noisy, making a loud grumbling noise. I called Keurig and they gave me the run around. They said noise is because I have it on a hard surface (Silestone); I need to get a large mouse pad to put under it; the noise is normal. I explained that my friends' machines are not noisy. They said this is the way the machine should sound and that's that.. I had no other choice but to return it to where I had purchased it. A manufacturer who will not back their product doesn't deserve to have it on the market. No customer satisfaction guarantee on this expensive machine."
1,sadly disappointed,I was sent the wrong coffee machine. I had no luck when trying to contact the seller to try and fix this problem. I sent two e-mails and called many times. I was very disappointed in my experince with this sell but have had many positive ones when dealing with most amazon sellers.
2,NOT HOT ENOUGH,"This model claims multiple temps but highst temp - and the default- claims 191. that is not hot enough for me. plus once any cream added then easily not hot enough. I was hoping multiple temps meant the highest was like sufficiently hot but it is not for me. sigh, back to the microwave for me. also most kcups dont come out strong enough in terms of flavor no matter what size selected. true coffee lovers- well- I cant imagine they woudl put up with the watery result compared to real coffee like a bold starbucks offering from the bar maid. ah well, keep those 5 stars coing hypers."
2,Not for the coffee addict,"The B60 was a Christmas gift to my husband and I from my Dad. We have used an 'old fashioned' coffee maker for many years, but were excited to receive this as a gift b/c we would never spend that kind of money for a coffee maker and my Dad loves his.We got it home, hooked it up and it works great, BUT I enjoy/need multiple cups of coffee through out my day. (I'm a stay-at-home Mom) My husband thinks it's 'neat' which it is, but I think it's wasteful and a hassle.I also have a problem with the amount of coffee/tea/water, it gives you. I think the cup sizes are not enough, which in turn causes you to buy more pods. I also enjoy drinking tea in the evenings. I have tried the Celestial Seasoning's pods and do not enjoy them.This might be good for the 'one cupper,' but not the avid coffee drinker."
2,It was great while it was working,"I have had it happen twice now...It works great for the first few months. Then I go out of town and don't use it for a couple of weeks and the thing stops dispensing water completely.I've tried descaling, I use filtered water etc. etc. The only solution is to replace it. So I'm on my 2nd replacement from Keurig (replaced about 6 mos. ago) and I the same thing that happened again. Now I ended up with a shelf full of K-Cups that I can't use.Keurig has some reliability issues to work out.. try sorting the reviews to see the newest ones first."
3,Issues,"I purchased a Keurig B60 coffee maker on November 22, 2010. It arrived shortly there after and I have enjoyed the product with varrious issues.From the beginning, the pump worked intermitently and the cup size selector has never worked.Now the Pump has stopped working completely and based upon what I am reading on-line from other users, I am very concerned and am not sure I should purchase d a replacemnet unit if they are still having their reliability issues."
1,RIP my two B60's,"Our first one got it's little electronic brain fried when the power went out right in the middle of brewing one day. I don't blame the coffee maker for this, I only bring it up to say if you spend the dough for a Keurig put it on a surge protecter.The replacement we got (thanks to the retail store's generous return/exchange policy) has finally died after almost 18 months. I won't bother with a detailed review about the expense and quality of K cups, other than to say if you decide to buy a Keurig get the ""my K-cup"" so you can use your own coffee. But I wouldn't do it. A $170 coffee maker that doesn't even last 2 years is unacceptable."
1,Keurig's don't last,"I've never written an Amazon review before, but I feel so strongly about this product that I am now. There are many positive reviews on these brewers...but any of those can only be reviews done in the first days or weeks of owning the product. Anyone owning a Keurig brewer for a year will definitely have a different opinion. The promise of one cup, made very simply, is great. I bought one for myself and as a gift for my 96 year old grandmother. She has problems doing things with her hands so this was the perfect solution for her daily coffee. I've now gone through the hassle of replacing mine and hers THREE times....that's SIX brewers. The design is bad...the ""needles"" clog and the pumps go bad. One day you'll wake up and you can only get a quarter inch of coffee in your cup. It's maddening. Clean the needles with a paper clip, flush with vinegar...blah, blah, blah...the design sucks! The customer service was very good, but the company needs to hire new design engineers. BEWARE!"
1,"Works great for about 2 months, then nothing.","I have purchased 3 of these units. They work great for about 2 months and then the problems begin. The k-cup idea is fantastic but Keurig brewers are not ready for prime time. When you call the company for support, you leave your number. They never call back. I am going to try the Cuisinart unit, it that fails it's back to Mr.Coffee."
3,Only lasted a year,"I've had 2 of these B-60 units and both only lasted a year, not sure why they don't last longer. A friend told me that powering it off and not leaving it on all the time might be the cause, still not sure though. If I buy one again, I'll have a extended warranty on it for sure. Other than that it performed well, even though we only used it for a few cups in the morning."
1,the worst possible message for a child,"The gist of the book is that Rainbow fish is a beautiful and unique fish. The only way he is able to be happy is by giving away the thing that makes him a beautiful and unique individual. To make himself like all the other fish. Otherwise, no other fish will want to be friends with him.I'm guessing/hoping that Pfister's intention in writing this horrible piece of self esteem destroying garbage was to encourage sharing. It doesn't. The message of the book is that the only way to have friends and be happy is to destroy all that is unique and original about yourself. To destroy the individual.I suppose someone could write a children's book about how fun it is to rape and murder other children. Assuming that book isn't out there, Rainbow Fish is probably the worst children's book ever written.Terrible.the illustrations ARE lovely. Just not so lovely to override the terrible ""moral"" of the story."
1,Very simple...HORRIBLE,"Bought and returned the next day, terrible book HORRIBLE messages. DON'T waste your money, the pits! I would give it zero stars if that was possible."
1,A Socialist Fairy Tale,"A young ""rainbow"" fish who is adorned with beautiful scales is approached by a little blue fish who wants one of his scales. The rainbow fish goes to an octopus who tells him to give his scales away to make friends. The little blue fish returns, rainbow fish complies with his wishes, and friends are made with a simple exchange of scales for friendship.I believe that the rainbow fish represents a young Lenin whereas the wise old octopus represents Marx (tentacles = beard)"
1,Socialist Fish Buys Shallow Friends By Giving Himself Away,"Many thanks to all the reviewers who found this book's message disturbing. My daughter received this book as a gift and, I am ashamed to admit, I didn't read it before handing it to her in the bath. Fortunately, she can't read yet (one year old tomorrow). Recently, I was looking for bath books for my friend's Baby Shower, and I saw your reviews of The Rainbow Fish. I was horrified and ran to read the book. I promptly threw it away (no, I didn't give it to Goodwill, I don't want poor people reading bad ideas either).I thank you all so much for your candid, insightful reviews. They were terrific. Freedom of speech---just one more reason to love this country."
2,Sends the wrong message,"Sure the book is colorful, has wonderful illustrations, and your child will probably enjoy it, but it sends the wrong message about sharing. Some have said that it is because they had to condense the book to just a few pages, but even if you read the full version, it's basically the same: give away a part of yourself to get some friends."
3,Good product but small for Sony DCR-HC62 camcorder,"I purchased this wide angle lens to use with my Sony DCR-HC62 Mini DV but I realized that the thread size (25mm) was too small for my camcorder. Instead, I had to order a Sony VCL 0630X wide angle lens which has a thread size of 30mm. In general, this Sony wide angle lens is fine for taking pictures/video under wide angle setting but not good for close-up (zoomed-in) pictures. The quality of picture suffers when zooming in -- it does not focus properly. I realize people buy wide angle lenses to cover larger area/taller objects at a shorter distance but not for close-up pictures. Nevertheless, it would have been nice if this lens would work properly in telephoto mode as well. Then again one can not expect to get all of that with a very low cost lens."
2,Russia The Golden Ring,Alright if you like Churches but it was too focused in this area for my liking. The Towns that make up the Golden ring are interesting enough for a lot of reasons other than their religious side so some more time spent with the locals and points of interest in the various towns would have been good. The background references to dates that various items were founded or built added interest
1,Don't bother,"For want of a new Sherlock Holmes pastiche collection to read, I decided to give this one a try after reading about it in Booklist. The premise sounded interesting; alas, it plays out poorly. Holmes is so far out of character in most of these that it's not even funny. Yes, these stories are supposed to be other characters' views of him, but they could have at least retained some spirit of Doyle's original. Instead many writers take Holmes' character and run with it. For instance, the story involving Irene Adler's relationship with Holmes is not only unoriginal but ridiculous. I hope that there will be a new collection of pastiches, one that vastly outweighs this one in the quality department."
4,Nice to have other viewpoints than Watson,"I enjoyed this book very much, although some of the stories were shakey. I was pleased to note that I have shared magazine space with one author, Michael Mallory, author of the Amelia Watson series which ran in Murderous Intent Magazine, which also published my gallows-humor poem ""He Escaped"". One often wonders just what others thought of Holmes when Mrs. Hudson is always described as ""long-suffering"" and Lestrade and Co. as ""The best of a bad lot."" Then there was Watson's wives, who surely must have been the world's most understanding women. And Irene ""The Woman"" Adler-Norton: Did she really consider Holmes ""The Man"" or just another ""fool man""? Great stuff, guys and gals! Four Sherlock stars! And Mr. Mallory, I really must find me a copy of your book ""The Adventures of the Second Mrs. Watson"". I read all the ones in my subscription to Murderous Intent with relish! Quoth the Raven..."
4,A good (if dated) murder mystery story,"Because of the timeperiod/style it's written in, there is a LOT of unnecessary repetition of the ""facts of the case"" almost as if it were originally written as a serial and not a single novel. Other than that, this story had a Sherlock Holmes type character (NOT the protagonist!), a charming budding romance, Egyptology, and a host of details that put you right in the midst of the era."
4,Good product,"Saunders makes a good product and have for many years. The newer items don't seem to be quite as nicely finished, but if you touch up the sharper edges, they seem to be as good as ever."
4,great clipboard..but rusts easily!,"this clipboard works great. i work in a poultry production plant and use this clipboard to hold my various spreadsheets and forms. the little compartment in the front works great for my sharpies, highlighters and pens.clip is very strong holds several forms at once. the only complaint that i have is that the clip itself is starting to rust.other than that this is a good buy! love it!"
4,Powell's first album,"This is Powell's first album under his own leadership, done for the Roost label in the fall of 1955. Powell's tenor sound is warm and very appealing, while his approach is robust. COUNT FLEET is an up-tempo swinger, with good solos by sidemen Jimmy Nottingham (tp), Bob Alexander (tb) and Tony Aless (p), who also arranged a number of the tunes. Powell is the only soloist on most of the tracks; SWINGVILLE, OHIO is another one that gives the sidemen a solo taste. Not an album designed to break down any walls or chart new courses, but its basic, direct mainstream jazz delivery is first class."
1,"So-called ""research?""","It is immediately obvious that the author is guilty of the very same desire to prove a pre-conceived notion, that he accuses Yigal Yadin of. Except that his ""refutations"" are weak, contrived, and based on things that include, the precise wording or emphasis used by newspaper reporters in reporting on the excavations. The author repeatedly points to differences in the initial description of certain archaeological finds, and later descriptions of those same relics. Yadin's descriptions are less certain earlier and more certain after further digging and research. Is this not what you would expect from a careful researcher?You'll learn nothing about the archaeology of Masada from this book."
1,not as pictured,Beware what you get is not what is pictured here. Now I don't have a working generator and have to send this one back
5,Replacement item,Item was ordered to replace a defective one received from another vendor. Item was as described and shipped on time.
3,Nice box but a little cramped,"Nice box for what it does. It is cramped though when working with four x 8 awg wire. I agree with other reviewers that it is difficult to get the lid on with the unit box flush to your exterior siding. Plan it's location ahead, becuase if you have lapped siding you need to place the far enough below the lap to get the lid on."
4,"THEY ARE THE UN-TOUCHABLE FORCE ORGANIZATION,GET WIT' IT!","KANGOL,DOCTOR ICE,EMD (EDUCATED RAPPER) AND MIXMASTER ICE HAVE KICKED ASS IN THE EARLY 80'S WITH ""ROXANNE,ROXANNE"",""LEADER OF THE PACK"" AND ""BITE IT"" FROM THEIR FIRST,SELF-TITLED LP. ""SKEEZER PLEEZER"" IS THEIR SECOND,BUT ALMOST JINX. EMD WAS ABSENT ON THAT SET,SO WERE THE HITS WITH THE EXCEPTION OF ""SPLIT PERSONALITY"",THIS WAS A MINOR SETBACK. ""LETHAL"" IS THEIR BEST ALBUM TO DATE,""YA COLD WANNA BE WITH ME"",""THE RIDE"" AND ""LETHAL (FEATURING ANTHAX) FOR THAT ""ROCK THIS WAY"" APPEAL,PUT THIS BROOKLYN FOURSOME BACK IN PLACE. THE TOP. UTFO ARE NO MORE,UNFORTUNATELY,A GREATEST HITS LP WOULD GIVE YOU MORE OF THEIR OVERALL BEST,BUT THIS IS NOT A BAD START EITHER."
2,The Music is great but the quality of the product is poor,"In my opinion, Lethal is UTFO's best work. Production is tight and lyrics are mature and flow very smoothly. I wish I could say the same about the physical media. If I didn't know any better I would say this was a CD-R..... And whats worse one of the tracks is basically useless, Ask Yo' Mamma has an incessent Ticking sound. When I first heard it I thought something was physicaly wrong with my equipment, but it happens on everyplayer I try it on. Very annoying and disappointing. Its not worth the effort to send it back, I just look at it as an expensive copy of skeezer pleaser which has a couple of nice tunes. I won't even go into how they forgot 2 of the tracks from the original Lethal Album........."
4,Great for Travel,"We purchased this item to keep our 15 month a little entertained on a plane ride to Hawaii. Out of a 5.5 hour flight, he played with this item for about an hour. Best of all, there was no mess."
3,Not too great for 2 year old!,"Grandma bought this for my 2 year old daughter with the hope that it would relieve me from washing crayon off the walls and everything else. The concept is great, however my daughter tries to use the color wonder markers on everything else and then she can't get the cap back on so I find them laying around un-capped. Also, I don't think she likes the fact that the markers only work inside the lines and there is a slight delay from the time you color to when the color appears. We've also tried the finger paints and my daughter ended up dipping the color wonder markers into the finger paints - which didn't work so well. I think that the plain color wonder paper might be better than the coloring book style pages. I also think that it is geared toward an older child. I think we will be sticking with the regular coloring books and washable crayons for a while longer."
4,Nice story but rather dull.,"This was a nice story, but it was kind of dull and boring. It wasn't exciting and I like exciting books better. But it was a nice, old fashioned story. Still, it could be better."
2,Ho Hum,"This could have been such a better movie with my direction.It was really not very good. The premise sounded promising, but the film didn't measure up."
3,The Earp Brothers of Tombstone: The Story of Mrs Virgil Earp,"I was interested to see the Earp's story from the perspective of Allie Earp. I wanted to hear more about Mattie Earp and in that regard I was not disappointed. I, however, did not enjoy the way Frank Waters add words, in my personal opinion, to the comments made by Allie during the telling of her life's story with Virgil and the Earp brothers.Allie appear to be a very simple person, and that can be easily identified in her language. On top of that it appears that Allie had a complete lack of knowledge or understanding as to the political environment and events that took place in Tombstone during those days.I found better information from Boyer books, including the story of Josephine Earp, ""I married Wyatt Earp"". Nonetheless, in spite Waters continuous intention to taint Wyatt Earp reputation, the story has some interesting and refreshing points as seen from Allie's eyes."
3,"A slightly older, wiser Peter Cetera....","There is absolutly no doubt in my mind that Peter Cetera is a class vocalist. He has shown that over a career that has span over 30 years. ""One clear voice"" is a laid back, acoustic style album, which does him justice. It shows that his voice and lyrics are as romantic and passionate as ever. The album however, does show a more older, wiser Cetera, with songs like ""Apple of yor daddy's eye"" which he sings a tribute to his daughter. The opening song ""The end of Camelot"" has the same style of his 1992 album ""World falling down"", but with two duets and several ballads, you get the feeling that he has finally found his tempo for later works, and to be honest, he has deserved to make albums that he can have full control of. Best tracks include; ""Faithfuly"", ""S.O.S"" and ""The end of Camelot"". If you are a fan of Peter then it is well worth getting, but if you are expecting energetic pop/rock, go for his earlier albums."
3,Price was a little high,My daughter (age 7) loves to draw and write stories. She loves this gift and I love the storage container for easy clean up. While shopping around I was able to find this at a local store for less money. Wish I had shopped around first.
5,Great Value! Like the variety.,"After reading the reviews I wasn't quite sure if I had made a good choice to purchase this. However, after receiving the package today, I think it is a great value. We got crayons, colored pencils, crayola wonder markers, crayola wonder learning pad, a white drawing tablet, paints, a paintbrush, 2 glitter pip squeeks, and 6 sm packages of modeling clay, as well as a bag of plastic pieces I am assuming go with the clay. Everything came in a Sterlite Shoebox size sturdy container. I plan to purchase another one for my nephew's birthday. He will love it!"
2,This is getting rerererererereleased again?,"I bought this CD under the title ""The Freakout Album."" It's an EXTREMELY raw recording by the original Alice Cooper band. Most of the album is painful to hear, but there is a little gem in here...""Nobody Likes Me."" Asidefrom that there are a couple of songs that sound nothing like Alice (""Going to the River""). If you want to listen to good quality 'early' Alice Cooper stuff buy ""Easy Action,"" ""Pretties for You,"" ""Billion Dollar Babies,"" ""Love it to Death,"" or ""Killer."" Those have great rock music.If you want to own something for the sake of owning it... then buy this... if you are looking for great Alice Cooper music... SKIP IT!I am a hardcore Alice Fan and there is no other album I rank less than a 4 (on a 1 to 5 scale). Alice is God and is undeservedly underrated."
1,Don't Buy This !,"This awful bootleg has been issued and reissued for over 30 years. I have it on LP. It's an amateur recording made at the September 13, 1969 Toronto Rock 'n' Roll Revival held at the football stadium of the University of Toronto.Why does it sound so bad? For one thing, the concert promoter (Detroit's ""Uncle"" Russ Gibb) was a cheapskate, and provided only the minimum P.A. system, and this did not include stage monitors (which is why you often see photos of singers of that day singing with one finger in an ear so they could hear themselves).My guess is that, ""Ain't That Just Like A Woman?"" and ""Goin' to the River,"" the two songs obviously not sung by Alice Cooper are by '50s rebel Gene Vincent, who the Alice Cooper Band, formerly known as The Spiders, often backed up. He played earlier that day."
4,The Life of a Dancer,"Martha Graham: A Dancers Life by Russell Freedman, the full-length biography of Martha Graham, takes a deep look into Martha and the peole around her. She was a dancer, teacher, and choreographer who changed the world. Her life began in Pittsburg where she was born in 1894. The book also tells about the lives of her dancers, students, close friends, and lovers. The biography goes into great detail up until the day she died in 1991.I liked this book because of all the details it gives about her life and the way it tells about all the heroic things she did. I would recommend this book to dancers and people who enjoy the things Martha did in her 97 years of life."
3,"Fascinating Subject, But Poorly Written","I love that this book tackles the topic of the history of treatment of migraines and headaches. There is no other book that covers this ground, so it is good in that respect. However, it is very poorly written. I wish they'd done a better job with this fascinating topic."
2,Not useful,"Great Bachlor Parties contains no new and interesting information for anyone planning a bachelor party. The entire book can be summed up by simply stating beer, women, and sex."
3,Missing one thing...,"I was surprised that they didn't mention vegaspartyhouse.comI stayed at one of their properties for a bachelor party and it couldn't of been any cooler! Well, hopefully they'll add it in the next edition."
3,Paper just ok,"This paper is ok, but the grand kids I think would rather have the Dora or Car Story pageswhere they can color a picture instead of drawing one themselves. But this would all depend onthe kids ages."
4,Keeps my Toddler busy,I have a 2 year old who loves to color and this was great for keeping him busy. He has the Color Wonder Markers by Crayola and just needed the refill. Thanks!
5,The Old Timers,This CD brings you back in time and there isn't one song that will disappoint you. I highly recommend that you attend one of Frankie's concerts; he now has his son working with the band and his music will never die with us old timers!
5,What it could be and it wasn't,The best of the 80's progresive rock. The first album with several beutiful songs and several powerful songs. A big treasure to keep in mind.
5,"The best view of Calculus around, a mathematical must!","Originaly published in 1968, The authors both give the reader the ability to understand the connections that are being made."
5,Stars and Stripes Review,"This is a great CD of The Beach Boys music. The Beach Boys provide back-up vocals while various country artists sing lead vocals. Anyone who likes The Beach Boys and/or country singers like Vince Gill, Lorrie Morgan, Willie Nelson or Steve Warner will enjoy this CD.But for those of you who are looking for Volume 2... stop looking. Volume 2 was never released due to low volume of sales for Volume 1. That's just a shame.My dad bought this when it first came out and loved it. I was fortunate enough to find a like new copy without too much effort. He absolutely loves this CD. I have provided a website address below where you can listen to samples of the different songs on the CD (courtesy of Tower Records). My favorites are ""Don't Worry Baby"" with Lorrie Morgan and ""I Can Hear Music"" with Kathy Troccoli, although all of the songs are great. Enjoy![...]"
1,Dangerous Chair,"This is the first product review of my life, because of what happened to us. I had the same problems as in other reviews - three back-breaking returns to the store due to 1. broken handles that caused pinching, 2. broken frame on right near recliner button, 3. stained seat and bracket confusion. The most dangerous thing happened after we brought our newborn home. If the seat is in the reclined position (which it often is) and you try to get out by scooting forward since it is a large chair. The whole chair is off balance and tips forward onto the person. My wife (150 lbs.) was only mildly injured when the chair fell on her, and luckily she had handed off our baby. I was so suprised that I repeated the accident easily several times by simply scooting forward. In conclusion, bad materials, bad craftsmanship, bad quality control, bad design, but a really comfortable chair."
1,Don't waste your money!,"My wife and I bought this expensive piece of junk after the first one failed after 3 months. Shame on me for choosing the the shermag again, this one makes more noise than the first. The other reviews mention a ""bump"" but ours squeaks and creaks just like the first one. I will not invest in this company again."
1,Piece of crap,"I bought this beautiful teapot for my Mother, and it started leaking at the spout immediatly. The spout has now completely fallen off. I would not recommend this item to anyone!"
1,Size,"I never tried the product because when I saw the size of the bottle, I felt it was NOT worth the price I paid (15.00?!?!)."
1,Suggestion: look elsewhere,"After reading the other reviews, I feel as though I must've read a completely different book because I didn't find this book to have many helpful suggestions at all. Honestly, it reads as though it's been taken from some fluffy teen magazine or a scene out of ""Clueless."" Some of the tips were truly cringe-inducing. For example, ""don't be afraid to ask for help from the big, strong boys once in a while."" Please. A waste of money and printing material as far as I'm concerned."
5,One of the best,"This album never gets old. To me, it always feels timeless and appropriate, and it never fails to pull at my consciousness."
2,Overrated Bombast,"""Strange Times"" is an album which sometimes showcases beautiful guitar work, but is otherwise ruined by horrific melodramatic tendencies. A real standout on the album is the haunting (emotion tempered with subtlety, for once) ""Tears"", the frequently mentioned ""Swamp Thing"" is merely a showcase of simplistic power chord hooks. The major culprit here is singer/bassist Burgess who is guilty of melodramatic grandstanding both in delivery and lyrics. Worth checking out, if you can get a cheap used version. Otherwise your money (and time) is best spent elsewhere."
5,"Haunting, Dramatic and Beautiful","I first heard the Chameleons in the early 80's and was hooked. As a College freshman, Strange Times took longer to grow on me than earlier releases, but once it did those roots never let go. This isn't just a collection of songs but a journey. I feel like I've been through and experience after listening to the album. Now in my 40s, I still listen to this album more than almost any other. I would put this work up against other all-time bests such as Clash - London Calling, REM - Murmur, Radiohead - the Bends, and Nirvana - Nevermind as highest impact recordings. Put on a set of headphones and listen in a darkened room. Enjoy it."
3,A boy who moves to a new town learns it is full of danger,"I feel this book is okay. It started off slow but then got better. The story is about a young man named Adam who comes to a town named Springville learns it is called Spooksville for all the weird stuff that happens there.After meeting a few kids there they go on a secret path they heard of, a path to a land of danger."
4,The Secret Path,Adam a new person who moved to Springville is shocked whenhe hears about the past of Springville otherwise known asSpooksville.

4,Laser Line Level,The level works very well for establishing a flat plane reference line about my yard. This is all I needed. This tool did the job excellently.
3,Alright but first way better,This one had a few good parts in it but the first one was way better I would say you should rent this one if you like gory movies.
3,see for youself,I thought the first rest stop was acualy pretty good and so did alot of my friends who also seen the movie-give it a try you might be pleasantly suprised.

3,They're OK,"They work only with the Color Wonder books, of course, which is very limiting. The books don't allow for much creativity, like coloring outside the lines. These work fine for car trips and other places where you must be careful."
3,"Not a bad book, but not what I expected","When I bought ""The Complete Guide to Film Scoring"", i wasn't expecting it to be so... complete.Actually, being a music major i was expecting a much more musical approach to this subject. I was interested in examples and more detailed information about how to write music for a film. The book includes this subject in a chapter, but it is treated pretty generaly.What I found, and in really detailed way, were the means of making money with your score, full of examples, different approaches and all the necessary data to take full advantage of your score. However, it didn't satisfy me too much."
5,An Echo in The Darkness,"The book was amazing, couldn't put it down. It was the second in a series, and I will get the third book."
5,A Must Read,A great historical fiction giving a graphic view of life under the Roman Empire rule - and the trials and test for Christians. I could not put it down because it was so intriguing. Be sure and keep a box of tissues and be prepared to enrich your Christian walk. A beautiful love story and enriching tale of God's amazing love for even the worst sinner. Francine Rivers is an incredible author and a book I would recommend to anyone.
2,Christian Values shoved at you,The first book in this series A Voice in the Wind) I picked up by accident and LOVE LOVE LOVED it. I found out about 1/4 of the way through (through a search on the series) that it was Christian HF. I was glad I didn't know that going in or I would not have picked it up. I really enjoyed it and didn't feel like the religious agenda was the primary goal of the book. Great story and great lessons to be learned (regardless of what god you believe in)The second book was WAY different. Christianity really a bigger focus of the story here so much so that I couldn't just read past it and get on the great storyteller that Francine Rivers is. Sadly I gave up 1/3 of the way through this one and won't be reading the 3rd.
5,Unbelievably Good,"This is the second book in the series Mark of the Lion by Francine Rivers. I really enjoyed reading it. The ending is so pleasing, you want to read it again and again! Absolutely delightful..."
5,Engrossing first century historical fiction.,Rivers clearly researched thoroughly to present thisfascinating tale of early Christians including John the apostle. With real struggles and personalitieswe learn how we can grow through prayer and recall of the Scriptures as we see theoutcome of trials and testings beyond 20th century American experience. Book 2 of a series but could easily stand alone.
5,Only the best series of books ever....,"Quick review.Very Graphic, says it like it is. Very inspiring. I couldn't put it down. I read it in ten hours straight."
4,real page turner,I was fortunate to find a copy of this book in an op shop for only $1.50. Fantastic. a real blessing.
3,A couple of problems,"I found the language a bit 'strong' for a Christian book, although I realise it was probably 'of the times'. The thing that stopped me in my tracks though was the inference that Christ was born in spring time. Most commentaters place His birth around Sept/Oct and that is autumn/fall."
4,Good reading in spite of some flaws,"I did enjoy this book, but it was my least favorite of the three in the series. My main problem with it is that it tries to hard to mirror modern society. A lesbian feminist tells a young woman to have an abortion because ""it's a woman's right to choose."" I think that's a little too obvious. But the book did get me thinking about things, and I liked the ending."
4,A great book about God's unfailing Love!,"I admire Hadassah even when she's disfigured by the lions that she was sent to by Julia, she loves Julia and God no matter what. Marcus finally finds God and Hadassah and you'll love the ending!"
4,M-D Smart Tool Review,The Smart Tool has been a very effective level in work related projects. It has mainly been used to check slopes of newly poured handicap ramps in the city I work in. The Smart Tool is a very important part of the Quality Control process. I must also say that Amazon.com offers the best price on the Smart Tool.
2,"Niced features, bad customer service","I was familiar with their older product. I used a friends a few times and liked it, so I bought this. They changed the design in in doing so, have made it of a cheaper quality. The old design was a brushed aluminum with grips that were very useful. The new design is flat bar type aluminum that is painted.I put the level on my table saw top to calibate it. I noticed a gap under the level. The frame of the level was not flush. The reason is the end of the level had a small ridge on it causing the level not to sit flat.I called their customer service and they were friendly. However, I would have to pay shipping to return it, and then pay a shipping and hadling fee to have it returned to me. I would think they should pay for their error, not me."
4,Our Opinion,"We are 5 students in high school, who are reading this book because we had too. Once we started reading it we discovered how real it was. The book itself may not be a true story but it has real problems in it. Real problems that people go through everyday. Like there are really people who sterotype other people because of silly things. We are only halfway through this book and it has already made a big impact on us. We would recommend this book to others."
3,xm antenna,"Bought this to replace my xm snap radio antenna. works great. antenna cable longer than one that came with it, which makes it nice for wiring."
3,Is what it is!,"I haven't installed this yet due to the fact that I just used the one that was already installed on the truck. If it's and thing like the one I currently use, it does the job. One of the things that you have to watch out for is where you install this at. You need to install in a place so that the signal is not blocked, otherwise you will not be able to get a clear signal."
1,WASTE OF MONEY!,"i've been listening to reggae my whole life. I bought this because the title seemed interesting. I like Bob Dylan too. THIS CD SUX!My girlfriend uses it as a coaster next to the t.v. I can't believe music companies would put something like this on the market. First of all, the artists sound bored. I almost fell asleep listening to it also. The production is piss poor too. Do yourself a favor, save your money and don't be a sucker like I did."
5,A sure thing!,"Biofreeze never let's you down! It alleviates all aches & pains after workouts & helps prior to activities. I love this stuff. Additionally, the customer service is great! My package arrived open & missing a bottle; they immediately sent another bottle, no issues. Great service!"
1,"product was shipped incomplete, company won't answer phone","After I ordered this cd player it was shipped by a company called American Trader in Indiana, PA. As shipped it was obviously used, not new. I assumed I'd be getting a new one since I don't remember seeing that it was a used one. More important, the cigarette lighter adapter and tape casette adapter are missing, so it basically is functional only as a disk player with the headset, it will not work in a car as advertised. I tried to call the company on the phone. They sent no packing list or copy of the invoice, so I had to look up the phone number on the web. It turned out to be a fax machine even though it was listed as a phone line.This is an unhappy purchasing experience and I would steer other people away from this vendor."
3,The Ultimate Movie Review! - [...] - @tss5078,"This is one of those movies that is so ridiculously stupid that you can't help but laugh. Tom Arnold knows he has a reputation of being an idiot and he so plays into it. The Stupids make Harry & Lloyd look like Einstein! While the movie has no real plot and is just about really dumb people, I have to admit that I laughed until I cried! When Tom Arnold writes that song about being his own grandpa, I almost lost it. This is one of those movies that has nothing to say and no real plot, it's simply about laughing at the stupidity of others and it sure is fun!"
4,Brad Delp Branching Out,"If you're looking for that Boston sound and are disappointed by what Boston has released since 1994, then check these guys out. You won't be disappointed. Make sure you get RTZ (Return to Zero), RTZ (Lost), and RTZ (Lost and Found). The last cd has a bonus disc entitled Delp and Goudreau which is a must have for the Brad Delp and Boston fan. I give this cd 4 stars just because of its listening enjoyment. Boston will never again see those glory days and it seems as though Tom isn't really trying anyway. Corporate America was a disaster (I've reviewed seperate) and took way too long to come out. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised to see it take another 5-10 years for him to produce another 40 minutes of music. So, in the meantime you have RTZ to fill the gap."
3,An Unbiased Reflection,"Neal Cassady is a man both revered and despised. This book, which anyone interested in the given time period should read, gives an unbiased look at Neal (the Holy Goof and fastestmanalive) and the people who surrounded him: his family, lovers, and friends (Jack Keruoac, Ken Kesey, Allen Ginsberg, etc). It neither praises nor degrades him, presenting him merely as a remarkable man and letting you decide for yourself."
3,No chance to use it yet,"This was purchased as a back up in event of emergency, so I have not open the case. I had watched YouTube demo and it work well so I hope it will in event of emergency."
1,"Junk, pure junk....","I could not even light dry newspaper with this.. After several strikes I noticed the ""spark"" was removed from the core. It has a metal core that is coated with the striker element. POS. Returning ASAP... Packing a few proven Bic lighters instead. Just my two cents worth."
5,Don't have it?get it!,One of the most important parts of survival is fire and after owning other devices used to make fire I finally found this style of fire iron to be the most useful I can't say enough good about it but keep in mind these are best used in unison with tender such as char cloth or common household lent( or I find this to be true)also practice with it before running out expecting to start a fire in a situation where you have never used a fire iron.At any rate this is the only one I've ever dad any success with.
5,Part of my backpack survival kit,"This product works great ... I keep a small survival kit in my backpack when camping, hiking, etc. This is my 2nd fire steel and nothing really beats them when it comes to out of the pack reliability (except an open flame source)"
5,"Works perfectly, Indispensable if you camp","I have the red model for easier visibility around the campsite and in my pack. I use mine as my primary means of starting campfires, I keep a lighter and/or matches for my secondary because the firesteel is waterproof and extremely difficult to render inoperable.Prepare your tinder, stack your wood and strike the firesteel a few times and you have a fire. If you have any problems with this product you need to watch a video on how to use one. This particular model throws so many sparks, so far that I can't understand how anyone couldn't get a campfire lit with it. However, I'm sure there are people who think this is a butane lighter; it's not, buy one of those at the quick stop if you need it."
4,Even I can start a fire with that spark!,I got this for my Husband to go in a survival kit. He tested it out and the flame it made was huge! He was very pleased!
4,Swedish Firesteel - firestarter,I put this product in my hunting pack for use when hunting the back country up in Kansas and South Dakota. Works well if you prepare for making a fire. A basic knowledge of building fires is going to be needed if you are going to use this product.
3,Decent fire starter,I am not terribly impressed with this firesteel product. I think the magnesium fire starter kits are better because you can scrape off a pile of magnesium and then light the pile. You can't do that with the firesteel.
5,spectacular! brilliant!,"Who would have known such a wonderful artist existed if not for the work of this extremely gifted writer and art historian. In all my years in the art world, I had never even heard of Leonora Carrington. Thanks to Ms. Aberth, the magical brilliance of this artist has been brought to our attention. Gorgeous pictures and prose. Well worth it and sure to bring more collectors out of the woodwork to buy her art."
4,full intention do it again,"The Ministry Sessions remain a benchmark for dance music and particularly garagey sounding U.S house.Check Frankie Knuckles timeless '96 offering ""Sessions 6"" for proof.On the evidence of this set it would seem Smokin'Jo should let Eric Kupper program the next disc with her name on,and get someone over the age of 6 to write some lyrics for her.""If you were a box i'd get inside you,if you were the pavement i'd walk on you"" is juvenile to put it mildly.The music on Full Intentions' disc is stirring and uplifting.Lots of strings,Jocelyn Brown,Dajae,A.T.F.C and Bob Sinclar make for a fruity mix of tunes to vacuum to or just dance yer socks off to.Highly recommended though it is,on the strength of Full Intentions' superbly tuned ears,the ""Soulfuric Sessions"" also on this label[Defected]gets an extra star"
5,This is the real thing,"When you buy an unknown group, it can be a little scary. Well, Manolo and his Gypsies have turned out to be really impressive! Want to know what tradition the Gipsy Kings are coming from? Listen to this CD! You get to hear the real thing, without a lot of influence from other cultures and unnecessary instruments. Manolo's voice is clear (doesn't sound like he's been smoking three packs a day!) and the playing is delightfully clean, unencumbered, a real pleasure. You'll hear two styles: sevillanas and rumba flamenca. The latter is what you hear so much of in the Gipsy Kings' music. The sevillana is a lovely dance that has become very popular in Spain with a fascinating mix of rhythms in three and five. Whether you're dancing to this or just listening, you'll find this CD to be a real treat after all the over-instrumentation of Spanish music that has happened over the past ten years."
4,very good Album,The Walter Trout Album is very good. This is the second time I've bought this album. I lost the first one.As always my order was recieved before the date it was due. I'm very pleased with all my purchases from Amazon
3,"I am a fan of Nausicaa, but the graphic novel is way better.","Many of the best parts and the depth of the original story are edited out, somewhat understandable in translating a 1000+ pages of drawing into a 2 hour movie. On the plus side, the color added to some of the images. 3 and 1/2 star movie at best, maybe 4 for those who haven't read the astounding graphic novel. I give it three here to bring down average from five, no way is it a five. The story is just as complex as Lord of the Rings and would need three movies to be treated fully. This version, while not without it's charms, smacks of Hollywood.I was a fan of Miyazaki since seeing ""Spirited Away,"" his true cinematic masterpiece. I have watched most of his other animation and am only slightly moved by these lesser works.You would do better with the graphic novels on every level."
5,Great!,Most impressive animation movie in my junior highschool student.It was about 30 years ago. And now I enjoyed again!
3,Original voice actors were better,"I just wanted to say that i used to own the original Warriors of the wind and that the new voice actors in ""Nausicca of the valley of the wind"" are terrible compaired to the original. There was nothing wrong whatsoever with the original voice actors in ""Warriors of the wind"" and now here they go and change them for the worse.I was very upset that I had lost the original to a theft in my home so i ordered ""Nausicca of the valley of the wind"" because Amazon.com reffered me to it seeing as how i cant find one with the original ""Warriors of the wind"" title. When i recived it and watched it... my jaw dropped at how terrible the new voice acting was , i almost started crying.Despite the terrible actors i think the storyline is still damn good even if the voices over do it every chance they have."
2,WHERE'S MIYAZAKI?!,"After seeing almost all of Miyazaki's films I watched this one and... WHAT HAPPENED?! I was expecting another great film and this one! NOT GREAT! The animation was weird, the story pretty pointless, and the characters are annoying! I'm giving this puppy a 2/5 because I respect Mr. Miyazaki enough to not give him a one (even if I did hate it) lol! I guess it's just a matter of opinion. :D"
1,This movie stinks!!!!!,"OK, I know a lot of self loathing environmentalist love this film. Humans are evil, humans are bad and untrustworthy, animals are inherently good and superior to human beings and therefore animals should have dominion over our precious god, mother earth. That's the theme of this film. Watching this film makes you want to die, literally. After all, the earth would be so much better off if we humans weren't around mucking it up.I am quite sure that the self loathing creator and the self loathing lovers of this film had no issue with using the DVD player to view this film, which by the way is powered by electricity which was made possible by burning eeeeevil fossil fuels. I wonder if the creator ever rode in an earth polluting automobile or airplane and yet has no problem telling us how eeeeevil and stupid we human beings are?If I could give this film negative 100 stars, I would. The worst film I have ever seen in my life."
4,Beautiful,I always fall in love with the larger than life characters that Hayao Miyazaki creates. The story itself and the morals make you think. Highly recommend.
5,Action packed man / nature balance story,"I again, purchased this dvd for my daughter, due that she is an fan of all Hayao Miyazaki. Yet the film is a beautiful story of mankinds fight with oneself to live in balance and respect the balance of nature."
4,DVD-Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind,This is an excellent movie for any young woman. A heroine who saves the day.
4,River Mystery,"Go into this expecting something like a ""Midsomer Murder"" and you won't be disappointed. This is not a fast paced in your face shootem up as perhaps some people need a fix for action. However, it is a good movie that although occasionally convaluted still delivers a good story. Good acting, sets, and music make this a worthy rental and I even intend to buy it as I think it is very rewatchable. Burns does a fine job and the rest the cast are more than competant. The camera work is excellent and the director does a great job of making us feel haunted. Many will in fact feel deja vu as one reviewer mentioned. Perhaps from your university days, perhaps from somewhere else. Fans of mysteries should enjoy it. Especially those that enjoy the ""Stone Cold"" style and not just ""Die Hard"". Most Hollywood Videos carry this so rent it and I think you will agree it is worth owning."
1,dislike!,"Not sure what I expected, but I really did not enjoy this movie at all. I hated the ending, and the way the story just sort of faded out. Not the greatest acting either."
5,My all-time favorite Christmas story,"This charming story gives a realistic spin to how things really might have been out there in Bethlehem. It makes me laugh everytime I read it, and it makes a wonderful skit that our family loves to put on at Christmas time"
1,pour quelity tool stripped out!,"This is a pourly made socket. it's used for axle nut's but if they are on tight or rusted this is not the tool for you. mine were on tight, and the sides of the socket are weak. for less money you can go to your local NAPA and get it in a much better made material. I'm in the prosses of returning it and it's been a week now and no response. buyer bewear. this is the first time returning an iteam on Amazon."
2,problem..,"problem with his potty training views. He says ""While they're perfectly content to release warm, gooshy stuff into their diapers, children do not like these same substances running down their legs."" Yeah great. Except some toddlers physically can't tell when they have to pee. So are you going to make them pee all over themselves until they become physically able to tell? Also, my son likes being cold and wet. He doesn't care if he's cold and wet from peeing all over himself. Am I supposed to just get pee all over the house until he ONE day decides this is uncomfortable?? Sure, Rosemond's methods will probably work great for a lot of kids, since a lot of kids are physically ready by 30 months. But don't torture the little kids who aren't ready by then."
5,Excellent!! You have to read this book.,I've read almost all the books in the series and have to say that this is one of the best. A must read if you follow the storyline.
2,Patronizing And Verbose,"This book is patronizing and verbose. For example, there is a passage in which Einstein reflects upon his appearance as he stands before a mirror. Surely this entire episode was invented to fill space since no historian would ever record such mundane private thoughts. This wasted space might have been used to discuss the physics that made Einstein famous. Instead, this book contains long passages on history and politics but only limited discussion of science."
5,outstanding,This is a hard to find cd! I lost this several years ago. It played on a jazz station in LA when it first came out. The live version of Pretzel Logic by Donald Fagan and Michael McDonald is my favorite.
5,Husband loves it!,My husband has been wanted to get this disc for awhile. He loves the songs on it and plays it often. Good music!
2,Not what I expected,"I might be wrong, but when I read the product description I thought they come in pairs and they didn't. Therefore when I ordered the front and the rear I was expecting to receive the four pieces and I just receive one front and one rear... Total useless if they are not changed in pairs..."
1,Wrong products,"These are NOT pioneer boxes. These are MBI boxes. I bought them and was very disappointed since I also have bought pioneer boxes before, and when I compared with the MBI, the latter one is much less sturdy and even the index cards are flimpsy compared with the Pioneer's. Do not buy these.Also, Adorama's customer service is very unfriendly in regard to making their customers satisfied. They insist that they are the same, that I need to return them on my cost, because of their mistake. They flew from one reason to another with blame from that they have never carried pioneer products, to Amazon's mistake in naming them Pioneer. But then their own website also has named them Pioneer. Anyway, just reconsider about buying any products from this company. It's not worth it, considering the shipping is outrageously high. It is my honest opinion."
4,this is an excellent and very positive hard-core album.,"six feet deep is one of the most powerful hard core bands to have ever existed, who never really got the attention that they deserved. the vocal and musical styles are great and very listenable. this is hard hitting music that flows smoothly with an underlying christian message. two stand-out tracks are ""purify"" which displays excellent musical ability, and ""broken tree,"" which is a haunting ballad. this is extremely hard, heavy music...you wont soon forget, or be disappointed by this cd."
1,"Read my review of ""Strongarm"" from New Mexico.",You guys have a SERIOUS problem with your relationship with the Lord. This stuff is so bad that the demons run for cover!
1,Had two of these: Neither lasted a year,"I've purchased two of these in the past two years or so. After about one year, the caller on the other end could hear me fine but I could not hear them. Same exact problem with the second one I purchased (same symptom after one year). This is a great product if you're one of those people who loves to talk on the phone but you couldn't care less what the other person is talking about."
1,Disappointed,"Although I order this product, I thought it was supposed to fit my Pantech phone and it doesn't. Therefore, it was a waste of money."
4,Redeeming,"In the seventh Gossip Girl book, certain characters are developed beautifully, and others are are overextended beyond normal range. Blair is still neurotic, her mother still a lovable buffoon, Serena the childlike dreamer, Nate the unattainable dream, Jenny the desperate child, Dan the lost intellectual, Vanessa the knowing but unwilling hipster, and Aaron the affable gentle soul.Some of these characters (I won't say who) are turned into bloated overextensions of themselves. It gets tedious, but all is redeemed with an unforgettable ending that rings with righteousness and a feeling of ""all's right with the world again"".Much, much better than the last two."
5,Use it for tying flies. LOVE IT!,Had no problems. I tie flies for fly fishing and love this light/magnifier. It can be adjusted easily and locked into position. It also has a power plug! The price is great too.
1,waste of money,"it broke the second time I used itplastic parts where it should have been metaltotally unusable, total waste"
5,Great light!,Bought this for my wife that does a lot of needlepoint. Light is excellent and magnifier very handy for the small detail she works with. Now she can't live without it!
3,Not as strong as the first two books,"As various observers have noted above, this third offering in the Andy Carpenter series is showing a bit of wear at the seams.The ad-libs are still great. His riff on the absurdity of skydiving's protective gear three quarters of the book through the is vintage Rosenfelt and very funny.However, Bury the Lead has neither the shock value of the debut or the suspense over Laurie's fate of the second book in the series. It is hard to be concerned about the defendant this time.If there are books in Donald Westlake's Dortmunder series you haven't read yet, they would be a better use of your time than Bury the Lead."
2,A One sided Account,I have never read such a one sided account of a regretable incident in Northern Ireland's history. All the fact's from both sides have not come out and until that happens we will not the truth. I laugh at people from other countries who think that they know everything about the troubles in (NI)unless you have lived here you don't know what it's like.
5,I didn't expect such a GOOD MUSIC!,"I really enjoy the Army Of Lovers' songs and especially songs from this album like Crucified, Say Goodbye To Babylon... Songs like Someone Somewhere and Obsession are one of the best I've ever heard. Also I very recommend to you their songs - Sebastien and Carry My Urn To Ukraine - unfortunately they are not included in this incredible album. Highly recommended for this decent price."
1,Disappointing,"Bob is a more talented stand-up comic than he is a writer (unfortunately, being one doesn't automatically make you the other). The only humor lies in forced one-liners linked together by an over-edited, uncompelling narrative -- the author is obviously writing for the stage, not the page. Pass it up, you won't miss a thing."
5,Laughing out loud in the privacy of your home.,"No matter what, no matter when, no matter how often I read this book, I laugh every time. I've read each book from Bob Smith at least 5 times, and I am enlightened, humored and tickled every time I (re)read them. I highly recommend this book to anyone who likes reading autobiographical humor, especially if you've ever thought your life was funny enough to publish."
1,Greatly disappointed,"The size 7 Pampers is not that much bigger than the size 6, just less diapers in the package. Half the time my son wakes in the morning with one of the tabs torn and the diaper hanging.I won't buy these again."
4,great quality diaper,this is a great diaper - we have tried others and pampers seems to be the best fit for our son - we have used them on him since he was born and are now at the final size in the series. hopefully he will be out of them soon!!
2,Very disappointing,"It is impossible (or from west standing point of view, possible) that one book about actors of Russian revolution is without pictures of Lenin and Trotsky and in this book it just happened!You can find the pictures of almost every participant in revolution but not of them!!Obviously intentionaly!Absolutely unbelievably."
5,"Practices For Everyone, Not Just In Sales","Marty Clarke's years of experience as both seller and buyer can directly benefit anyone who reads this book and applies the lessons he outlines. In the particularly succinct, humorous and sharp style that is unique to Marty, the reasons behind the land mines are covered along with how to avoid or, when necessary, lessen their damaging effects. I've also found his `Worth Repeating' summaries to be very useful in their own right as quick reference reminders when I need to refresh the lessons.Like many things, it boils down to practicing common sense and extending common courtesies, useful in everything beyond the sales environment that is the context of the book.Marty doesn't go in to the buyers' land mines, but his `Leadership Land Mines' is an excellent companion piece to this one.Leadership Land Mines! 8 Management Catastrophes and How to Avoid Them"
4,Cokin 045 Sepia Light Filter,"Catch a glimpse of the past. Recapture the Sepia tones that give old pictures that special charm. Just photograph your subject in color with the Sepia filter. Or copy a black-and-white print. This filter will yield a pleasant Antique effect when combined with a soft-focus attachment like the Diffuser (083 and 084) or the Cokin Dreams (091, 092, 093) or Pastel filters (086 and 087). The Cokin 005 Sepialight is also a sepia filter but the effect is stronger.Helpful hints : When you have color negatives printed, be sure to tell the lab that the sepia tone is intentional This filter can be used with most other Cokin Filters, with the exception of color filters."
3,Little small for cat6,"I've not used these on cat5 or 5e, but with the cat6 I used them on, if I wasn't careful there was an occasional tendency for the cable jacket to be marred."
4,Precursor to? Up - Up - and Away!,"At last! I read & reread this one 4 times in a 10 day period. The careful plotting and the characters are a real delight. It is nice to see characters grow, change & react to 'real life'. Bren Cameron is particurally good with all of his public face and inner conflicts. Nice to watch the unknown become revealled. The atevi in particular are a delight to read about. They show a flexibility that I did not really expect. Having already given my first copy to a friend overseas, I am now getting ready to buy the second copy - and bemoan the fact that I will have to wait for the next volume! Well worth the keeping!"
5,Get those scratches out.,I had a scratched display on a portable TV and on a GPS receiver. This stuff did a great job in making the scratches (mostly) disappear. It takes a little elbow grease (work). And be careful not to get it into little nooks and crannies; it can leave some residue like a car wax.
3,Categorical,"This CD is quintessetially top 40. Everybody was dancing to it in the early 1990's and nobody remembers it now. In the early 80's there was toy music...music that was engaging for a while, then became tiresome and was thrown away. This is like toy music plus 20 years...like an old teddy bear it brings back a flood of memories. That's why I bought it.Well, there's also the fact that I met her in Sac-town during her promotional tour and she was sweet."
2,Should have rented to try it befoere buying.,"The description says ""Ex-prisoner Robert Luke goes back to the Rock..."". That implies to me that I'm going to learn about Alcatraz prison and life as a prisoner there. It is more like a biography about this guy and VERY LITTLE to do with Alcatraz itself. There is precious little footage of the island and prison. It's mostly the camera focused on Mr. Luke as he tells you his life's story. If you want to learn about Robert Luke - the man, this is for you. If you want to learn about Alcatraz, keep looking - you will be very disappointed in this one."
2,hmmmmmmm,Works ok for now but the cord is very flimsy and cheap. I don't think I will get too much use out of it.
5,A very good volume to start on,"It would be difficult to add anything to the marvelous review from _Gramophone_, with which I'm in complete agreement, but I thought it might be useful to say something from the perspective of a collector who has been wary of buying the Koopman recordings because of the large investment involved in purchasing three or four discs at once, in the process duplicating many cantatas of which I already have fine recordings in my collection. Volume 8 has the advantage of several cantatas that have been under-recorded, but, more importantly, as Gramophone says, every performance is extraordinarily convincing and vivid. Listening to these recordings is like stepping into the Thomaskirche in 1724 (or at least it feels so to this Bostonian of 2000)."
2,complacated,"This products works okay , but you need a battery(9v) and it is more complacsted than it needs to be. I have had other stud finders which were easier to use ."
4,no seams,I love the no lines across the toes. They are very comfortable. I am going to purchase more pairs. .
1,College Pro Calculus is NOT for Win XP,"I bought this software because.... of course... here it comes.... I needed help with Calculus! My computer is top of the line, with absolutely NO conflicts... recent drivers... and all that good stuff! I CAN'T GET THIS PROGRAM TO WORK IF MY LIFE DEPENDED ON IT! Maybe the tutor stuff is good (I wouldn't know), but only if you have a previus O.S. to Win XP will you be able to utilize it! This program sucks."
4,"Whoa, It's Dangerous to Hang Out in this Town","Following the discovery of the first three bodies in this case, the deaths come thick and fast. It's not as tight as the first mystery in this series and the author does a real no-no in the introduction of one of her villaims but it is fair to say that she definitely gave hints that there was another one skulking around.The introduction of Diane Fallon as also a knot expert allowed some different forensic techniques to be discussed, add to that the mummy inherited by the museum and the contents of the Victorian pickle jar that came with it, and there's lots here to keep the biggest forensic mystery junkie interested.While you don't have to have read the first book in the series I would definitely suggest it. Connor has a habit of continuing small threads from book to book. Besides the first book is also a good read."
2,A bit disappointed,"For such great reviews I was pretty let down. Like another reviewer, I found too much info about stuff that has nothing to do with the crime or story. And ALOT and WAY too much info about knots. If you buy it you'll know what I mean. Started out very Promising....got half way thru and it fell apart. I can assure Patricia Cornwell she has NOTHING to worry about!!"
2,Only okay.,"While I always learn new things in reading Ms. Connor's books, I also find myself wishing she'd get on with the story. After being told, way too many times, that the character is an expert in knots and likes caving, I did a lot of skipping through the story. The dialogue is wooden and awkward, and, for my taste, the plot could have been edited down to a tighter, faster-moving story. It's an okay book"
4,Rocky-o remembers wrong,"Yes, this is the band that recorded the album, ""Queen of the Neighborhood"" - that was their first album and this re-release is of their SECOND album. Hey Rocky-o - didn't you remember the SONG ""Queen of the Neighborhood"" was on the album of the same name?? This albums kicks off with Willie Dixon's ""Too Many Cooks"" and it smokes, though I always prefered the first album. This is the same line-up (with a new drummer) and here Rocky is right - a great band and Marge Raymond is one of the best female singers of all time."
5,...queen of the neighborhood...,"i remember buying this album on vinyl, way back when, and i have never forgotten it...the original title was ""queen of the neighborhood"", and when you hear lead singer marge raymond's voice, you'll understand why...this was at a time when the only female singer i cared about was annie golden from 'the shirts', but once i heard ms. raymond, it was obvious that she had one of the best voices around, and i still to this day wonder whatever happened to her...and if you are wondering whatever happened to the rest of the band, i can at least tell you that the lead guitarist, jimmy crespo, went on to fill in for joe perry during his 'missing' aerosmith days...if that alone helps you decide to buy this, i'vedone my bit for 'queen' and country..."
4,Reliable Heavy Duty Cable/Connector,"This cable is definitely heavy duty with the ability to accept 4 grounded appliances. With the exception of being a bit difficult to insert the plugs, this cable-connector has been easy to use and reliable."
5,Exellent book. Helps kids understand plantation life.,"This book was one of the best books that I've ever read. I've trying to find other books by Barbara Smucker. I really can't explain the way I feel about this book, but I know that they are definantly positive feelings"
4,Excellent overview of Hinduism. Profusely illustrated.,"This book gives one a brief but comprehensive overview of Hinduism. The work is a brief, 84 pages; but even so the information is presented extremely well. There are numerous pictures and illustrations that supplement the text.My knowledge of Hinduism was mainly from reading books by Western authors. This book gives one a Hindu perspective. Although I was born in India I did not realize how scant my knowledge of Hinduism was. I verily suspect that many Hindus will find a nugget or two in this book.The book format is more akin to the coffee table genere but this is one of those display books that is actually quite useful.I do have a cavil. There is no index to speak of; so if you recall a name finding it in the book is quite a chore. However, all in all this is a bargain.If you, like myself, just want to know the basics of Hinduism and Hindu culture, this is a great start."
3,"Hanging pictures, great. Measuring, not so great.","This product makes deciding how to hang photos and the like at equal intervals very easy.It is not, however, all that great for measuring the dimensions of a room. I found it difficult to use (especially because at a corner, you have to pick it up and place it on the other wall (so it's not going to be accurate; you'd have to add however many inches it had left to go on either side)).Considering I bought it for both, I'm quite a bit disappointed."
5,Excellent sound and easy install,"I had been watching these on Amazon but found them locally at a discount big box store on sale. For the price, they are excellent. I put in about 12 pairs in my home and am very pleased with them. Good from low to high volumes. I found that the quality of signal going to the speakers made all the difference. Once I powered up my amps, they made the speakers shine!"
2,You get what you pay for,"I'm currently auditioning speakers for a new whole-house audio distribution system, so I installed these in one room as a test. The price is certainly attractive. My test room is fairly small with a low-ish ceiling so in my application the speakers must be used at relatively low volume/power. They are fairly ""tinny"" at low volume levels, with some improvement as you increase the volume. I would not recommend them as primary speakers for low-level background music. They might be ok for rear surround applications or in a very large room where they must be driven at higher power levels. For the price, they are pretty decent speakers, but not suitable for the application I'm planning."
4,Great collection of shorts!,"Here's another great collection of short gay films. From a teen disco to a midwestern farm, these stories reflect a wide panorama of gay life in the nineties. Excellent!"
1,Unwatachable,"I found this movie, a series of short stories, to be boring and uninteresting. Film making is hard work and I congratulate the film makers for their efforts. However, I could not finish watching and do not want this movie a part of my collection."
3,This video contains decent stories.,"The stories in and of themselves were well directed and performed; however, having seen the first Boys Life, these stories were not what I was expecting. Some of the stories were just too, for lack of a better word, weird. Primarily, I cite ""Nunzio's Second Cousin."" I sat through this story wishing that it would hurry up and end. ""Alkali, Iowa"" was the best story on the video for it dealt with being gay and multigenerationality. ..."
2,Kholer Coralais cartridges problems,"Like another reviewer, the faucet was great for a few months. Then the handle began to stick for both on/off and hot/cold. It was hard to adjust he flow or temperature. It eventually developed a squeak like a rusty hinge. Kholer has been great sending out new cartridges (3 or 4 in the past year), but they only last 2 - 3 months and have to be replaced again. Who wants that aggravation. Loved the faucet at first. Now I will buy another brand. I have never had this problem with any other faucet. Sorry, but this faucet just didn't measure up."
5,Professional grade,"I have bought 3 of these. Excellent for running power tools. The lighted cord comes in handy since usually at clean/finish up time it is dark. Only down side is that it is heavy. However that is to be expected with this quality. Also too thick and rigid to tangle, big plus. Stain resistent."
4,"Horses, Love That's Hard, and Rural Life","Orphaned like her young horse, Harriet Gibson in 1910 has few choices: The home where she has lived with her widowed mother must be sold to pay the debts for Harriet's own schooling, and she and her unbroken horse head up the ridge to the home of an aunt -- a relative, but one with an old and uforgiving grudge against Harriet's mother. It's a rough transition, and things get harder, including perhaps never being able to return to the school where Harry was doing so well.I want to give a copy of UNBROKEN to each middle-school girl I know who loves a horse -- but also to all the ones, grown or not, who'll become engrossed in Jessie Haas's completely convincing narrative of 1910 life in rural New England. I couldn't put the book down. If you like Katherine Paterson's books, you'll also love this one by Jessie Haas."
2,Published for eagles,"You have all heard the expression ""read the fine print"". This whole book is fine print. If your visual acuity is not comparable to that of our feathered friends or rated at 20/10 or better you will need two assistants. One to hold the magnifying glass and another to hold the tightly bound book open. It would be fine for regular reading but NOT sheet music!!! I would have gladly paid the extra bucks to have the material printed in a reasonably sized format such as 8 x ll with a spiral binding. I would give it NO stars and three black holes in this regard. It got 2 stars because the selections and arrangements are good. ..."
5,Olympus VN3100 Digital Voice Recorder,I purchased this to record a hypnotherapy session to quit smoking. It was so easy to use and the voice recording is very clear. The recorder itself is very compact and has the capability to store information in different files. I would highly recommend this digital recorder.
4,Nice Surprise,"Having never had a digital voice recorder before, and having only used microcassette recorders to record school lectures in the past, this little unit has turned out to be quite a nice surprise. The enclosed instructions are pretty straight forward and easy to understand. The display is pretty easy to read under most lighting conditions. The controls are few and easy to operate. The biggest surprise was the sound quality during playback; it also is pretty nice. If 4 1/2 stars was an option I would have chosen 4 1/2 stars and not 4. Each function I listed is accomplished rather well, but still not what I would call stellar. I do not say this to be derogatory about the product. In fact, it is in the products favor. You see I critique tools pretty hard. Now having said that; would I recommend this product? You bet. For the price it works well indeed. It is not perfect, but then again what is?"
3,olympus vn3100 voice recorder,I own a vn900 which works well but only has a short memory--this one has much more memory but does not record music (guitar) very well--sounds like it is under water--the voice comes over clearly but it's hard to understand chords--I bought the recorder to capture ideas both vocally and instrumentally and am disappointed..
5,Perfect...,"I bought this chain with a little fear that I might not like it, but really it's perfect. THe only flaw is that it's too short for me, but I'm not going to substract a star because obviously it was my fault because I didn't imagine the length right.Overall...see it, buy it..."
5,"Beautiful Chain, Great little gift for anyone!","I bought this chain to replace one of my wife's broken chain. I gave it to her as a small gift around the holiday season. When my wife opened it and tried it on, I was very surprise by the quality. She absolutely loves it and wears it everyday. She was going to use the charm from her previous chain but just left it alone by itself. I am very happy with this little chain and so is my wife. I would recommend it to anyone. You'll be very please with it."
5,A great CD player,"I started out with a Classic brand CD player, and it wasn't all that great. So I found this one, and decided to get it. #1 it was good looking, #2 it had a lot of stuff that came with it, and #3 it was Philips brand, which I've heard is a company of great products.The CD player itself is pretty good. It looks nice. The headphones that come with it are okay, but I only use them occasionally. It's cool how they fold up so they take up less space when you are packing them. The remote is awesome, I always use it when I'm jogging or walking or whatever. It's very handy. The rechargeable batteries are okay as well, but they do take a lot of time to charge and they don't last forever.The ESP works very well, as does the DBB. The volume on the CD player is great, but with the remote you'd maybe have to turn it up more to be able to hear the same volume as you would without it.This is an overall great CD player."
1,Waste of money,"I bought this before going on vacation so I could keep my money on me while I was at the beach. It seemed to seal just fine when I tested it after receiving the product. However first time at the beach, my money got soaking wet. I tried it a second time just in case I did it wrong the first time, and again the seal just opened right back up again. It was a waste of money."
1,Generic Rock,"If you like generic, bland, emotionless rock, this disc may befor you. However, if your tired of contrived""alterna-rock-n-roll"" don't bother. Poor production, singing, and lyrics litter this disc. A remake of ""Tainted Love""! Puuleeezh! This classic should haver never been touched! What an outrage! A truly desperate attempt to garner some radio play. I really did give this disc a chance but it just never caught on. Needless to say I at least salvaged ( ) out of it by selling it to my local music store. END"
1,Would have given it NO stars if possible,"According to another reviewer: ""Bon Jovi"" ""big stadium act"" ""Def Leppard"" GET REAL!!!!This the most cliched garbage I have ever heard and the reason why grunge took over. This music and everything about the band is so stupid and laughable, you would have to be a total yutz to listen to one of these songs more than once! ""Your love is like a loaded gun"" PLEASEThe fact that this came out in 92 further illustrates what a bunch of posers these guys were. I have news for you guys, grunge did not cost them a shot at the big time. This band and a 100 others like them, was a bunch of no talent jack-wads, who tried to jump on a band wagon that was already gone. If any of them are doing anything other than flipping burgers today, it is better than they deserve.I would sooner have my toenails removed by a hedge trimmer than listen to this crap. Oh, nice album cover, though! No one ever though of putting a girl with big boobs and a rocket on the cover before!"
2,Good for nothing,"A rip off of Friday the 13th. This movie seemed to be a made for TV movie turned into a video rental. All of the 'fade to blacks' reminded me of a late night horror suck fest on a low budget cable network (CABIN BY THE LAKE anyone ???) It was slow, had many holes and no plot line but it was still good for a little fright at night. I thought I knew who the killer was but then it shocked me with a twist. That was good. Note to writers, producers, directors: Next time, pick a cast that can act and a stunt killer a tad larger than Ally McBeal. ""Trevor Moorehouse"" looked like he was going to fall over holding that large chain saw."
1,cough cough RIP OFF!!!!!,"Waring: One spoiler, if you REALLY want to see this, don't read the folling.This was the biggest rip-off I have every watched! It rips off Friday the 13th, Hallowen, and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre! The film is about a hockey mask wearing mad man who runs around killing teenagers in a summer camp. Now wear did I hear that plot before?( Jason 4: The Final Chapter) The killer is sopoesd to be Trevor Moorehouse but in the end, it turns out to be some guy acting like him. Yes, the film is that bad. Check out the sequel, Jason: The final Chapter, and Jason lives, there ALOT better."
1,wow,"This movie was a huge disappointment, It looked good from the cover but it was so stupid,a lot of what they said didn't even make sense, they said he was back for revenge but they never even explained revenge for what, I also thought tat the actors could have tried harder. I'm not even an actor and could have done better then they did. I am really sorry to say that if you want to get this movie the only advice that I can give you is DON'T"
5,Beautiful and Powerful,"If you're wondering whether to purchase or to download this CD, listen to Ann Hampton Callaway's rendition of ""Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow"", along with ""I've Dreamed of You."" Both are sung with such emotional depth and power. Both are incredibly beautiful. If you like Jazz Vocal performances, then those two tracks alone will leave you in awe at her talent, if they don't leave you in tears at the beauty of her singing. Ann really wraps herself around these songs, rendering them with emotional richness. She has a great vocal range as well. If her voice doesn't wow you at first, it will grow on you. The more I listen to her, the more I'm amazed at her ability as a song writer and as a performer."
3,Slow Going,"Slow is, well, slow. I wanted Signature and I got this. If you like Ann Hampton Callaway buy this CD but if you love Ann and I do run for your life. This is torture. It is like having a Ferrari and never getting it out of first gear. Oh the crowds will stare and there will be oows and ahs but in the end you are just lugging the gear box. I'm sure this looked like a good idea but it just doesn't work. Ann is at her best when she is running at full throttle scatting and floating like Route 66 or Start All Over on the Signature CD. Even Babe Ruth struck out, next time Ann you'll bat it out of the park."
5,Most comprehensive source about New Age,"Well written after lots of research this book deals every possible issue in New Age movement.Easy to read and understand it will not leave any of your questions about New Age unanswered.You will also get very clear, to the point positions of Christianity on many New Age practices.It is best book about New Age I ever read and highly recommended to anyone."
1,Won't get fooled again.,"Notice that the good reviews are from 2001, when XP was standard. Note that as of 2010 Minolta has chosen not to update the driver to be Vista compatible, in my case turning this expensive hardware into garbage."
3,Opinion,"I purchased the 14-gauge Coleman Cable Polar/Solar 100-ft. cord for an electric lawn mower. With vinyl cords I have experienced sever coiling of the cord after some use because of turning the mower from one side to the other in normal use. At this time I've had insufficient time to experience whether this will happen with this cord sheathed in Neoprene. I purchased this particular cord to avoid this condition thinking maybe the wires were wound differently than with vinyl cords. Thus far though, in ordinary use I find it just as ornery with interlooping as the vinyl type. Although it should be lighter in weight, it doesn't appear to be. Year's ago when a 16-gauge without a ground was specified for this use, there was no trouble like I've experienced with 14-gauge three-wire cords."
3,I Have New Appreciation For Penises,"Rarely has a body part been elevated to center stage in quite this way! If you love history, origami, the Outback, or penises, or are gay or a woman who likes shocking her mother by leaving things like this lying around where she can see them, I strongly urge you to read this incomparable book right now!"
2,mannafestgodsglory,"This was a disappointing purchase. It tasted really funny, kind of like compressed tea or something and I didn't really feel any affects. I ended up buying the liquid caps instead and they worked great. I would recommend them instead. It was also annoying that there are more pills to take in this from compared to the liquid form."
2,Real lightweight,"There's nothing really bad about this slim book, but the writing is bland and cliches abound. I found the book neither enlightening nor funny. I'm a big golf fan and like Peter Jacobsen as a player. I always like to see him win or do well. I think that the problem with the book is that Peter is simply too nice a guy, at least in print (and that does not mean to imply he is not otherwise a nice guy, too), to be very interesting."
4,Stagg Gig Bag,"I needed a bag to put my Schecter Omen in just to store it as I don't gig; just do studio. But, didn't want it collecting dust. It's a very close fit, but it's all I need. On another note, when I bought this the picture was for the bag but the image during & after purchasing was for clippers. I even told Amazon this and now they've changed the image for the product to clippers. Hopefully , if you order this product you won't get the clippers!"
2,Its alright for the money,I purchased this case to enclose a Agile Al-2000 I purchased here on Amazon. Overall the case fits a les paul style guitar pretty well but provides pretty minimal protection due to being rather thin. If you are looking for a cheep option for transporting a guitar in this is alright option but I wouldn't consider this for more than storage or for a minimal risk environment.I ended up replacing it with a hardshell case as soon as I had the money to due so.
1,A waste of paper,"Prof. Meriam FAILED in conveying the information required to DO dynamics problems. The examples skipped many steps and were minute relative to the problems provided. You better buy another book if you wish to learn somehing about dynamics. I feel bad for the tree that sacrifiecd itself to a totaly worthless cause. YES, I am VERY disappointed with this book...a worhtless invvestment. No wonder many feel my pain with this text."
1,"Terrible, and so is your instructor if he requires this book","This book is terrible. If your instructor requires this book in your class, drop the class becuase then the instructor isn't very good either!!"
2,Unclear Examples and Wrong Solutions,"While the text portions on the theory are mostly acceptable, there are two things that make this book very unhelpful. First, the example problems are not solved in terms of variables - numerical values are used from the beginning, which makes the example both hard to follow and less easily generalized to help the reader understand other problems. Second, the book provides solutions to the odd-numbered problems, but it was not uncommon for these solutions to be wrong (even the units were wrong!). This created a lot of frustration. A third minor complaint is that the book is not organized well - the chapters are far too broad (several are longer than 100 pages) and yet closely related material still sometimes appears in different chapters."
5,Excellent book!!!,"Everything you want to know about the Nascar tracks. Jay goes into detail about many different tracks. This is a must read for race lovers. Nascar expert, Joey Baird, read this book and loved it."
5,really big!,Just what we were looking for to transfer oil into trivet from gallon. Great for other uses since the hole is larger than most.
5,check the size,this funnel is perfect for getting wine back in a bottle I used it for making vinegar the strainer removes the slime pretty well.
3,nice tool,when i took it out the box it was just what i wanted good tool for me i realy like the strainer pull out part
4,Quite pleased,"I am pleasantly pleased with this funnel. I wanted a stainless steel funnel to replace my plastic one. I want to get away from using plastic. When I saw this funnel with the strainer I thought ""what a novel idea"". I've used it to strain grease twice already and it did a very acceptable job. But if you want this to strain small particles of breading or flour sediment this won't do that. However, if you have sizeable gunk, this does a good job and the strainer is removeable. It's big and it even has a handle. And the best part, it's stainles steel so you can put it in the dishwasher."
5,crush them cans!!!,"This thing works great, is sturdy, and inexpensive. Great product, especially for the price."
2,Reads like a book report,"I've read this book twice now, and while I've gotten useful tips out of it, it really does read like a book report of the Inner Game of Tennis, frequently using phrases like 'Gallwey refers to...' and 'Gallwey says'. So I read the Inner Game of Tennis and found that I could have garnered much the same insights from this book without the added and sometimes confusing editorializing by Mr. Green. (And some of Green's additions just complicate things by giving your 'self 1' additional ammunition that it may not have thought of yet.)All in all a useful book, but to do it over again, I'd skip it and go straight to the Inner Game of Tennis."
4,A book for all musicians,"There's a lot to like about this book, including the specific techniques used to get past mental obstacles, so musicians can play better and enjoy their playing more. I also enjoyed the encouraging tone it takes with the reader. The authors give you the sense that anyone can make music.The personal stories that illustrate the book's strategies help you connect more deeply with the material. You may even get a chuckle or two from some of these.What I get from the book is that we all have inner resources that we've hidden from ourselves, and that we can learn to tap these resources with a bit of work and AWARENESS.This book could actually help in lots of areas besides making music. If you like motivational books, such as those by Tony Robbins, or books on NLP, this book might actually seem tame in comparison, but still relevant."
3,The Inner Game of Music,I think this book is a bit long winded and needs to get to the point. I have not finished it yet so perhaps I am being harsh.
5,Perfect for CGG16B Reversible Griddle,"These bags are eight bucks at Sportsmen's Warehouse and are a great fit for the CGG16B reversible griddle. Not much else to say. Nice, thick canvas should do the job well. I can't yet speak about the durability, though."
3,A decent 2-Tone CD,"Laurel Aitken is known to be the ""Godfather of Ska""; however he was also very active in the 2nd and 3rd waves of ska as a perennial live performance favorite. On this album, he decided to get together with Potato 5; a two-tone ska band in order to unite with the new kids coming up. Well, really the result is really a Potato 5 album with Laurel Aitken adding his vocals. I do not have access to the credits, but I kind of doubt that Laurel had too much to do with writing these songs.This album is standard two-tone ska fare really. I personally feel that ""Bluebeat Suit"" is a very nice, laid back song; and the title track is also enjoyable. Overall, this album is better from start to finish than a whole lot of other ska records from that time period. But if you don't feel as if you are a true two-tone fan, you can easily pass this one up."
4,Great little luggage cart,"It is good quality, folds very compactly, and is as light-weight as you can get. If I had any complaint, it's that I wish it were just a little lighter (like ""ultralight"", that's the only reason it didn't get 5 stars), but then I suppose there might be problems then with strength/durability, etc. Overall, highly recommended."
3,it does the job,"It does what it says. The wheels make it difficult to stow in a pocket of my briefcase. Brookstone makes one that folds easier and slimmer, although it is twice the price and doesn't have a tie to secure the load. All in all, it does what it claims."
4,Durable & Light,"This cart gets daily use, carrying briefcase and purse. Very durable, yet lightweight and compact."
4,I was a part of the story- it was fairly accurate,"The book was well written. I was involved with the project from the Charter Flight from L.A. through it's docking at Long Beach, Ca. I would reccomend this book to anyone interested in the cold war period of the 70's."
5,The Shining Court,"This is a wonderful addition to this series and although it doesn't answer all the questions that are lurking it takes us down roads that needed a bit more clearifcation. I don't think she has strayed or in anyway made the storyline more difficult to follow, in fact I believe this book as just opened up new doors...and I for one am hoping this will lead to 4 or 5 more books! This in an author I could read for a very long time and I admit I am hoping that she doesn't give us a quick one book tie up....and if she does I hope she begins a new series immediately!"
2,not my style of writing,"well... first i must say that i dont like the writing style. she spends so much time explaining something very, very simple. leave some of the imagination to the readers. second, she explains it over and over throughout the book. third, the action scenes... well, those are done horribly. she'll start to get into and then starts jumping back and forth with the characters past... just let the fight scene finish!!!!these books were recommened by a friend (dont know if i should call him a friend anymore after trying to read through these books).i guess after reading george rr martin's books you expect a lot from authors. i must say that i am really disappointed with this series because it has a great story line, just isnt written well.mel"
1,Man Hating at its Finest,"I found this book at my University library. This is the kind of nonsense that gives feminists the name ""man haters"". This kind of drivel is akin to Hitler's racist, anti-Jewish rhetoric that you find in Mein Kampf. It's akin to the kind of garbage that you would find in a white supremacist library. It's male hating, sexist to the extreme. The authors of this anthology hate men like neo-Nazis hate Jews and white supremacists hate black people.Since this kind of garbage is published in our Universities and our women's studies journals then we truly can say that men are the subjects of institutional sexism for no other reason than being hated as men.This utter crap needs to be called out as hate speech because that's exactly what it is. It should be preserved for no other reason than to set an example of radical feminism's origins being an origin of hate and female supremacism."
1,Has Sharon Hannibal ever met a white boxer?,"On page 12 of this book is this quote regarding all white boxers (approx 25% of all boxers born) ""They (white boxers) are perfectly acceptable as companion dogs although they do not resemble the typical, smart Boxer that most people imagine"". I don't know where Ms. Hannibal got her information from but white boxers are at least as smart as fawn or brindle dogs - the original boxers were white, and many white boxers hold agility, obedience, tracking and schutzhund titles. They also are EXACTLY the same as the colored boxers in personality (I've had the pleasure of being owned by both). If a statement this wildly erroneus is in the book - how can you trust the rest of what is says??"
3,MacDraft Professional,"I am generally pleased with the software and its use on my iMac G5. I was used to using AutoCad on a DOS machine and am getting aquainted with the differences. So far the confidence I had before is not not there with this software. After more use, I may be willing to raise my rating."
2,Don't waste your time.,Sheen made no effort to act and the story is implausible. It could have been so much more but falls far short of the mark.
4,Modern Sci-Fi conspiracy,"A good movie with a modern twist. Again, this can be a thinker movie, but it gets a little convulted with the love interest. Charlie Sheen also plays a bit of an irritant but it's this irritation that eventually creates the good plot. You could watch this with your family."
4,Excellent Laptop Stand,"I use this to stack two laptops and it works great for that use. I would have to argue that this stand seems a little wobbly if I was to use it to hold a monitor. Hopefully this isn't intended for a big CRT monitor as it would shake all the time. An LCD screen might be acceptable but there is the potential for any vibrations to ripple through the stand. I wouldn't recommend this for a monitor stand, but I highly recommend it for a great laptop stand to house either one or two laptops stacked."
1,Flimsy Construction,"What a ripoff! I have a 22 inch montior that I don't dare put on this piece of junk. The thing wobbles and the shelf actually leans forward with virutally everything I try to put on it: the monitor, my printer, a binder full of papers. The thing looks great in pictures but functions horribly. It's so unstable that I finally stopped using it and wish I had returned it when I had the chance."
1,Nothing like the first!,"Such a let down from their first self-titled cd. Lechuza doesn't have a distinct, awesome sound like the first. It just doesn't click when you listen to it. First cd was unbelievably good, I recommend purchasing that one instead. Forget about buying Lechuza, it's a waste of money."
3,Alright but not great.,"There isn't anything worong or bad on this cd. There also isn't anything, in my mind, that really sticks out. Whenever I hear pop-punk or emo bands I automatically compare them to A New Found Glory, the best there is at that genre right now. Fenix Tx can't even be compared to them right now. This cd is just kind of boring, listen to a few songs before buying it."
5,and now for something completely different,"if you bought this cd hoping it would sound like the blink-clones on their self titled album, then your going to be disappointed. this cd still has its punk sound, but it is also emo (tearjerker and song for everyone), hardcore (beating a dead horse), and even metal (something bad...) influences. this album shows that fenix tx a much deeper band than the wanna be blink band (i dont know why anyone would want to sound like blink anyway; they are not good!) we heard on the s/t. good job Fenix TX"
3,A decent scifi movie,"I didnt buy this movie, rather i rented it from the local movie gallery, and im glad i didnt purchase it. Its not that its a bad movie, it just has some special effect issues that bothered me. Now i know that they didnt have a huge budget to work with so im understanding with that. It just didnt captivate me, the story isnt that great, it is lacking in originality, but what can you do with this genre that hasnt already been done? So i think a score of 3 is just right. Not a buy, a rent."
1,Not much improvement over having no pad at all,Bought this product because the factory seat on the Gold's Gym 290 exercise bike is extremely uncomfortable. After about 15 minutes on the seat my pelvis falls asleep from lack of circulation. 2 other people have tried the Bike and complained of pain and discomfort. Bought this seat cover pad based on reviews and it seems that others oddly have a higher opinion of this product?Pros:Fits seat almost perfectly.Cons:Still hurts to sit on for more than a few minutes. Only moderate improvement over factory seat.Color me disappointed.
3,Doesn't fit,"I purchased this seat because it is supposed to fit large bike seats. It doesn't fit the seat on the Nordictrack cycle, but I was able to get it to to work. It is better with the cover."
1,Sad.,"Eight very small, dry, broken, tightly and badly packed lavender plants dying in a cardboard box arrived on my doorstep 10 days after ordering them. I quickly planted them in good potting soil with good drainage and in full sun. Four died within a week the other four are still performing badly after a month. Don't waste your money."
5,Great roaster.,"Love my new garlic baker. Directions are right on the box, and the garlic came out perfect. Cut the directions off the box, and store it in the baker, for next time."
1,The base cracked the first time we used it!,"We followed the instructions to the letter about soaking it in water, putting it in the over before preheating, etc... and it came out of the oven with a big crack in the base the very first time. I doubt it will be usable after a second time. I'm not impressed at all."
1,Where's this great roasted garlic I expected?,"I followed the instructions to the ""T""; however, the garlic was still pretty hard. Baking it for longer time didn't help it much either. I tried wrapping it in foil and it came out better, but still just okay. Another reviewer has suggested a oven proof dish with water and covered with foil...I'll try that now. But now what can I use this useless oil stained clay container for?"
5,Excellent Guide Book!,"I highly recommend this guide book. The author takes you on a very personal look at this incredible state park in Maine. The photography is amazing, as well."
5,"If You Are Going To Acadia National Park, Buy This Book!","My husband, mother, three young children and I recently spent a week in Bar Harbor and we used this book for everything. The wonderful pictures and history of the area get you excited for the trip, and the great information packed inside makes sure that your visit is a great one! This was a big trip for us, and I bought no less than four guidebooks to make sure I had all the information we needed. This is the only one I took with me to Maine and we used it every day! One of the best guidebooks I've ever purchased."
2,I couldn't sit through this,"I love Shakespeare, but I have to say, this is one of the dullest efforts I've ever seen, despite the usually delightful Ben Kingsley as the fool. This adaptation d-r-a-g-s. Shakespeare should be about the language and the action, not the setting and mise-en-scene, and I kept waiting for the actors to talk and the camera to turn from scenery to faces. Perhaps my expectations were overly high, since the cast and director come with excellent pedigree. Try the ""Midsummer Night's Dream"" with Kevin Kline and that skinny girl who played Ally McBeal -- it's a hoot!"
1,Poor quality DVD,"It is like a plane video tape - no caption, no scene selection, no special feature, etc. Greatly disappointed."
5,Magical Shakespeare,"I paid full ticket price four times to see this film in the theaters when it was first released. That's how much I liked it. This adaptation of Shakespeare is one of the finest I've seen on film - better than any of Brannagh's, in my opinion. Trevor Nunn directs an ensemble of well-known pros (Ben Kingsley, Helena Bonham Carter, Nigel Hawthorne) and appealing newcomers (a pre-Harry Potter Imelda Staunton, a pre-James Bond Toby Stephens, and the incandescent Imogen Stubbs [Mrs. Trevor Nunn in real life]). Achingly handsome men and lovely ladies mix it up in a gender-bending comedy of obsession and mistaken/hidden identity, and Ben Kingsley's singing of Shakespeare's well-known songs will break your heart (in a good way)."
5,Down with Malvolio,"Twelfth Night is definetly my favorite Shakespare. The scandal, the humour, the story line is magnificent. But that has nothing to do with this adaption, I say well performed, well directed, well cast. well done =) Having performed in this production once myself I should know =). he he he he he"
1,does not work,"This DVD was delivered promptly and the price was fair. The only problem is that is does not work. I can't get it to play, it is as if there is no info on the disc at all."
5,Great for slicing bread,"This is great for cutting nice even slices. Even though the slicing guides are not adjustable, you can move the bread to adjust the thickness of your slices. Great product."
1,Not so Hot,"It worked about as well as the executive branch of the federal government. Fortunately, it broke pretty soon after it was placed in service. If only the executive branch would break down that rapidly. Amazon might make some money."
4,Bread Slicer and Guide,"It works quite well, though I had to find a longer bread knife. It's nice to have the guide fit the larger loaves from my bread machine. I love the crumb catcher detail. It might help to let customers know what size loaves it will accommodate."
2,Requires Extra Long Bread Knife,"Basic design does what it is supposed to do, but the width of the unit is a little wide, so that an ordinary length serrated bread knife keeps slipping out of the grouves. I would prefer the slices to be a bit thinner. The plastic is a bit flimsly, but has not broken so far."
1,Poor design,"As noted in my e-mail, the space across the base, between the guide sides, is inadequate. My large bread knife only extended 1/4 or 1/2 (I forget what I noted on the e-mail) inch beyond the far side guide. The knife provided the the bread maker had less overlap. This inadequacy forced the user to use very short strokes in the attempt to slice bread. My third attempt resulted in the lower near side (for right hand cutting) to shatter at the screw point, flinging plastic across the counter.The item is not a ""slicer"". It is a guide only."
1,Fail.,Total and absolute piece of crap.I wanted to like it. But the wood is much too soft. The back panel falls off every time we use it. Even my 8 yo declared it to be total junk.This could be improved in design with better quality materials.I wish I could get my money back.
2,"Poorly constructed, but it works until it breaks.",The reviews are right- this is pretty crappy. It worked okay (I particularly like the crumb catcher) for a couple of weeks until one of the plastic guides broke. It's virtually impossible to fix.
1,it was horrible!!!,"I cant believe i bought this thing. i thought it would be a good idea but its not!!! the slices are too thick, and even though i have a normal size bread knife, when you pull the knife back and then forward you hit the plastic instead of going through the slots. NOT worth the money!"
3,Could be improved on.,We had this slicer for a few months. Cuts a slice of bread *just* a little too thick for us. My main issue is that the bread knife has cut groves in the bottom slats. There should ideally be grooves built in the wood for the knife to cut through the bottom crust without dulling your knife. Today one of the separating pieces of plastic snapped off. ~sigh~ The removable plastic piece on the ends will not come clean. Always looks greasy and dirty. Will not be buying this again to replace my broken one.
4,I like it!,"I do agree it would be nice if the slice width was adjustable, but I love it. It's beatiful as well as functional. I don't care if the wood is gouged; that just makes it look more used. My favorite table in the kichen has gouges from years of family sitting together enjoying meals. I do own a very long very old bread-carving knife, so I have no problems slicing. I am very happy with the purchase."
4,It works better than doing it free hand,"Although this bread slicer could be a bit taller to accomodate larger size bread machine loaves, it is so much better than slicing bread free hand. The slices come out even every time.It's no heavy duty unit, but works just fine for home bread. Works just fine with a sharp bread knife.It's well worth the $15-$16 I paid for it. If it was more money, I would expect better quality or heavier duty. Good Product, Good Price."
2,Great Idea but poor execution....,"The concept of this bread slicer is a good one.....the actual product doesn't live up to the theory or the purchase price.1. The plastic end piece doesn't stay in place and constantly falls out when slicing.2. The wood is flimsy and is cut very easily when slicing bread with a bread knife.3. About as many crumbs as the crumb catcher catches and equal amount escapes through the guides.4. I put a couple of rubber ""feet"" I purchased at the hardware store on the bottom to stop the unit from sliding around on my counter or table.I ended up using the guides to score the bread and then slicing ""free hand"" on a plate which seems to work better than the actual product. I'll purchase another slicer in the future after doing a little more research."
2,Norpro Bread Slicer,"What I most like about this product is the crumb catcher feature. Unfortunately, I have a problem with the acrylic piece at the end of the cutting board popping out when I am using it. I would also recommend that the wood used be a harder wood such as is used normally with cutting boards as when I slice it leaves grooves in the wood."
2,NOT WORTH THE MONEY,"I bought the bread slicer with bread maker. Love the breadmaker but the slicer is not worth the money. Tried using it after bread cooled as recomended, but still didn't like it."
1,Not Worth the Buy,"Instead of wasting money on this product, I could have just used a searated knife, place the bread on a dish and cut even slices myself. I cannot really explain with words how worthless this product is. Don't wast your money"
2,"Should be plastic, not wood","This product works nicely to slice your freshly-baked bread. The only problem is when you get down to the bottom, the knife starts cutting the wood. I think it would be better if the bottom was made of hard plastic like the attachments on the sides and front."
2,Not the Best,"I was really disappointed when I first used the bread slicer, it is not sturdy the least bit. The plastic guides could be more durable and the sides should be adjustable. My bread machine makes round loaves so the slicer do not work the well. I would probably not buy this product again."
3,Norpro Bread Slicer w/ crumb catcger,"Makes slicing bread easy except for the end panel (with BREAD printed on it) very sloppy fit, needs a bit of modification"
4,Works fine,"Just that it works perfectly with 10"" bread knife. Its hard to use 8"" knife. The description of the item cab include that so that people who are interested should know."
4,It needs a little TLC,"I love the bread slicer. For the price it can't be beat. You need to know that you will have to put nonskid pads on the bottom and also good tape to hold the front together. Other than that - it works just fine and we have nicely sliced bread. I will probably refine the plastic box to make it more secure, but the concept works. One more thing; you need a really long knife or it comes out of the holes. I use a serrated bread slicer that is about14"" long."
1,SUCKS!,This is the worst invention ever. My longest knife did not even work with this. The bread sits between the plastic walls and moves around when being cut. The bread tears and gets squished. The knife blade hits the other plastic wall and moves the loaf. THIS THING SUCKS!
3,Needs Work to Work,"I think Norpro needs to upgrade their packaging. When I open the undamaged box that contained the slicer, I found the wooden frame broken in three places. Nothing else in the order was damaged, and the slicer was not the most fragile item in the box. Since it would be a pain to ship it back, and since I do a little wood working, I decided to keep it and repair it myself.After the repair I see that I like the concept, but the plastic cutting guides could be made with thicker material. They flex too much."
2,Not getting as much use as I thought,"This fits full size bread loafs, but it's not so good for French Bread, baguettes, and bagels as it is not sideways adjustible. The wood base seems to be made of a wood that absorbes things. Bread, of course, includes some oil and the wood base pick up that over time (and can't be cleaned without making things worse - e.g., wood soaking up soapy water.) My knife often cut into the wood base, opening a crevice into which germs may gather. It is a great looking product new and it does catch crumbs through the slats in the base. The crumbs are hard to remove as well, even after vigerous banging."
4,Worth the cost...,"I find it a little ""lightweight"" in construction. I've had to re-tighten the screws that hold it together a couple of times, but it's not a problem. All in all, for the reasonable cost, it's worthwhile and effective. There are more solid ones available, if you want to pay double or triple, but it suits my needs."
1,Flimsy Product,Bought this slicer guide to cut home made bread from my bread machine. Put it together and tried to slice a soft loaf of bread. The plastic guides on the sides are thin and bend very easily. Could not even cut the bread. Will end up throwing it away. It is useless. Very poorly made product.
2,falls apart,I am very disappointed in this product. It looks sturdy and useful. But the end piece will not stay in place. It falls away as you slice and then the sides do not stay still. I do not find this usable at all.
3,Great concept; poor construction,"We loved this slicer, but the plastic broke after only about a year of use. Just minor modification would make this a great product."
2,Bit too wide,"Too wide to use a standard 8"" bread knife or most breads. Regular bread is 4 1/2"" wide, bagels 5"", yet this slicer has a 6 1/2"" space. Takes at least a 10"" blade to reach and cut using the slots."
1,Don't waste your money,"I was enticed to buy this (when buying a bread knife) by its low price.However, even that cost was too high.It doesn't work very well, is flimsy (after about 10 uses I have numerous broken guides), and uses a great deal of storage space between attempted uses.I don't think I've ever seen a loaf of bread that is as wide as this device and those from my breadmaker (Breadman) leave 1-2 inches free on either side. On the other hand, it's too short to slice the (already short) loaves from end to end. Because of this, I must hold the loaf by hand anyway and focus on keeping the knife from contacting the super-fragile guides.The only reason this device is not in the trash is so I can use it enough times to be thoroughly aggravated. Then the cost of it will be worth the relief I feel as I drop it into the bin. That day is a few loaves away."
3,cutting bread,A firm loaf of bread cuts very well. But a soft white needs a sharper knife to do the job well. I had to purchase such a knife and hope it will do a good job.
3,Falls apart with regular use!,"I really like this bread slicer BUT, if you use it a lot, which we do, it falls apart. I am going to find my brother in law and try to get him to fix it!!! Also, a regular 8"" bread knife doesn't work well with this so I had to buy a longer knife which, was the best thing that ever happened to me! Other than when I first believed in Jesus, of course! And my darling children. They are a bit better than this bread knife."
2,Low Grade,I would like to see it made from a better quality of wood.It *is* too wide for the bread knives included in most cutting blocks. It is also wider than necessary for most bread machine loaves.Overall more annoying than satisfying
2,breadslicer,It's too wide for the loaves of bread I make and the slicing area is too short so that I have to turn around the loaf. It's difficult to get even slices.
1,Almost two stars for at least making me laugh,"Against better judgement...and the other poor reviews...I bought this. When I opened the box one of the ""slats"" fell out..well...it should have been ON the ""board"". Also, this thin piece of wood was bowed..as well as another one. The bread therefore will not sit flat. I have not completed putting it together...waiting for the glue to dry. Laughed cause I went ahead and bought it regardless...and it proved the other reviewers right. Hmmm...I think my kid could make a better one......"
1,[Low grade] pine,"A great idea for a product, but it is made of a [low] grade of unfinished pine, stapled together and bit too small for most loafs."
1,rip off,"I used this slicer twice. The first time, the end kept falling out. I glued that in and the second time I used it, 2 of the tines broke. The loaves from the breadmaker don't fit and there is no adjustment, it just keeps sliding around and you can't get an even slice. If the tines hadn't broke, it would be in the mail back to China or wherever. Cheap shoddy merchandise, stay away from it."
2,Crumbly!,"Looks great in the picture. It probably does exactly as described, except that the one I received was broken. I'm taking that as a big clue!"
1,Ever notice how flesh gets really flexible when a zombie starts to tear at it?,"There's bad, and then there's so bad that all I want to mention is that someone has a huge collection of Fangoria at home and used every one of the cheap makeup ideas in this one, including the one about filling a balloon with grape jelly, putting a mask on it, and bashing it with a 2x4 to make it look like a zombie head explosion. Not even fun, just badly done.I had more fun making Tazmanian Cheese Devils. Take a hot dog, put it in your mouth, chew it up. Now spray ketchup all over your face. Now spit it out, screaming ""Ma dhug, ma dhug!"""
2,save your $,"Save your 12 bucks. This timer has a nice look, that is why I gave it the 2 stars. If your thinking of buying this timer, stop, buy a different one."
2,Not what it used to be,"I bought this timer to replace an old one I had that I had loved a lot and got years and years of use out of. But like everything else in this world, I guess, they just don't make them like they used to. From the beginning it has had a way of randomly stopping in mid-time, and I have to keep an eye on it to make sure it's still ticking. Give it a shake and it starts up again - but what good is a timer that you have to keep an eye on? May as well just keep an eye on the clock. I guess the thinner plastic should have clued me in - also the bell is not nearly as loud. This is what my husband calls a ""product simulation."" It looks and smells like a real timer, but it is not one! I'm off on the hunt for one that really does work like the real thing used to!"
1,Its not worth even $1,"I can't believe how this headphone which can't recieve clear sound even in 2 feet distance from its transmitter can be thrown on the market. I did everything but I couldnt solve the static noise problem.There is a part which says 'Up to 150-foot transmission range with manual frequency tuning/reception' in this headphones manual and Amazon's 'product details' part. When I decide to return this headphone, on Amazon's page about the returning reasons, there were no choices like `wrong information for the product'. The closest was `The product is not as I expect'. Thats why, now I have to pay for delivery for the product which is good-for-nothing."
1,old book,not at all up to date we didnt even take this on our trip. go for new frommers guide instead
3,NYTimes loved it -- I'm unconvinced,"I bought this CD based on a review I read of it in the NY Times.The reviewer was very impressed by it and compared it veryfavorably to Elliott Smith, of whom I am a big fan. While Ican see some basis for that comparison (now that I've listenedto it), I have to say that the main disappointment of Tihista'swriting is the lyrics. They are too straight forward with noroom for personal interpretation or poetic allusion. It's alot of ""She's the most beautiful girl in the world"" kind ofstuff, which always strikes me as dull, even if the melodyand production values are more interesting. But I will saythat some of the melodies, the arrangements and the productionvalues are quite interesting and make the CD not whollyunenjoyable."
3,Couldn't finish it......,"Having read several excellent stobie piel books, this was a disappointment. Our hero was unique. Loved his nearsightedness and his gentle character. Evie was very spirited and really fiesty. Didn't like the ""de ja vu indian lore"" aspect of the book. Got half way thru the book but when the hero, our zorro, asks Evie, ""how was I"" after a night of seemingly supernatural sexual satisfaction, I was turned off..........sorry stobie. However your 2 civil war books were outstanding!!!"
5,Wow. This one is a winner!,"A wonderful fresh plot. Rafael, aka the Renegade, isn't just dreamy and delicious, he's a real hero that will keep you up at night reading about him. Thanks Ms. Piel for another wonderful book."
2,Infuser split after 4 uses,"Infuser appears to be made of poor quality stainless steel: the cup portion of our infuser split open after 4 uses, so is no longer able to hold liquid."
5,Cute and practical,This little pot is cute enough to leave out on the counter and also is practical enough to work well. I really like it!
4,Garlic Keeper,Product is very nice and decorative. It was a bit larger that I expected but others I have looked at are way to small. I am satisfied with my purchase with no complaints.
2,Works but poor quality,"This product is nice looking on the counter and really works. The problem is its quality. After sitting on the counter for a few months, the inside top edge started to chip off. I had my hand scratched, then realized what had happened. Doesn't anyone make any good quality product anymore? I'd be happy to pay a few more dollars."
1,Junk,Overpriced at $12. That's pathetic. Doesn't look anything like the picture. More of a heavy shirt than any kind of jacket. Didn't think I could go wrong for the price. I was wrong.
4,Helpful and Fun,This is a really great book. I like the feeling that I'm using the right word in the right way. The senteces that show how to use the words the correct way are helpful and sometimes even funny.
1,Excellent for an experienced photographer,"Although this camera helps slightly to produce OK pictures and helps you have control over the effect it has on the photograph, the advantages do not outweigh the cost. This was, in short, an extreme waste of money since it's range of expected capabilities was limited. Also, it is difficult to position the filter onto the lens. I would not recommend this product unless you have an umlimitless supply of money, andn't think of anything better to spend it on."
1,horrible,"I really don't like this conditioner. I've used other Paul Mitchell products before and they were great, but I don't understand how THIS product came from them. First of all, it does not detangle my hair at all. My hair actually feels WORSE after using this conditioner. I've used it twice so far, and both times my hair has come out frizzy, limp, and damaged looking. When I use other conditioners, my hair turns out really smooth and full of body. I'm throwing out the rest of the bottle and getting something else before this stuff ruins my hair!"
1,waste of time and money,"I do about 70 bags of Iowa freezer corn a year, this cutter is a joke. Cutter is dull and does not cut kernels off of ear making it good for cream corn, if that is what you like. Trashed mine and went back too an electric knife."
1,Does not work,"I bought this product for a garden full of corn, but it does not work. It was completely useless. It did not cut ther corn off ther cob. Thank goodness I also bought a small handheld cutter that worked."
1,Might be nice,"It looked like it might be very nice. I cannot critize the product. It was poorly packed for shipment and was badly broken. Amazon was out, so I could not get a replacement. No problems with return."
3,Baby Mozart,"Although the selection of music was good, I was disappointed at the synthesized sounds of the music. I have heard much of the ""Mozart Effect"" for stimulating learning in young minds, but why market it this way? Just turn on your radio to your local classical music station and give your child the benefit of the real thing without having to put more money in Disney's pockets."
2,french green bean slicer,"was difficult to use, didnt open wide enough to attach to counter, and didn't stay attached to shelf it was on. sliced ok for 3-4 beans,once I could get it to stay in place, but I grow beans and was looking for something that would do larger bulk."
3,Can't anyone make a clamp that works?,"As a slicer, this is a great tool. It will french slice your beans slick as a whistle. My biggest complaint is that it doesn't clamp tight. This seems to be a common problem with many clamp-on gadgets. They skimp on the length of the base and the result is a very wobbly clamp. So this is a two-man job: one to turn the handle with one hand and hold the slicer with the other hand so that it doesn't wobble while the second person feeds the beans into it.Clean up can be a little trying. I needed a toothbrush, thin paring knife and finally tweezers to get pieces of beans from between the tiny grooves and gears. I can't help but think that it'd be easier to clean if it came apart."
3,Rosas del Amour,Sounds very much like other albums. Same type of music just variations on melody. Pleasant to listen too but nothing new.
4,AWSOME!!,"This cd rocks.These guy's have talent,sounds like they have been together for many years.From Energy,Break Me and Motions this debut is definatly a must have if you like the kinds of Creed,Shinedown and 3 Doors Down etc."
4,Free your mind,"This book is a timely reminder that the United States has not always been in the thrall of the religious, that until quite recently it was possible to lead a full life in the political life of the nation without having to devoutly profess faith in Christ or god. Who knows, perhaps one day freedom of thought may have meaning once again?Freethinkers is an interesting history of atheism and agnosticism in America, charting the links of secularism with other movements that have made the nation what it is today: such as the abolition of slavery, civil rights, feminism and universal suffrage. Sometimes reform was achieved with the co-operation of the religious, sometimes it was achieved in the teeth of their determined opposition. This book gives a fascinating perspective which readers may not have encountered before."
3,The Language of Miracles,"I liked the book, but I enjoyed Amelia Kinkade's other book (Straight from the Horses Mouth) way better. Straight from the Horses Mouth had more tools in learning to communicate with animals."
5,another hit !,"Even if you really enjoyed Amelia's first book, you'll find more about animal communication in this new work, in theory, in practical details to apply straightaway, and in inspiring stories; and you'll find back her great humour which makes reading her pages such a great moment!"
2,Fair part,"This eliminator bracket is ok at best. I put it on a 93 F-150, the pulley supplied with it is significantly smaller than the one that was on the smog pump. This has the obvious problem of making the stock belt too loose. If you get this part you will have to buy a serpentine belt that is 2 inches shorter to make up the difference. Also no matter how tight you bolt on the bracket, it will be slightly turned in at the bottom causing the belt not to have perfect alignment. The pulley has a bearing set made in Japan that feels pretty rough out of the box."
1,X/1999 - ANY redeeming value= Tokyo Revelation,"When I saw the box artwork for this movie I thought: ""Hey! Swords, demonic-butt-wuppin, badass wings, apocalyptic mayhem?! Sounds like a winner!""...boy was I wrong. I'm shouldn't even go into discussing the plot...since there is a severe lack of it. At one point it seems a strong plot of epic proportions is being weaved..and then...without warning...psycho lesbian demon assasins! ""What's wrong with that?"" some of you might ask. It just ruined the experience, it all went downhill from there. The animation and artwork is actually pretty decent but it can't save the blunt stupidity of this film. I actually liked the first action sequence, that coupled with the way the storyline was being set up drew me in. The stupidity that followed pushed me away like if you smacked a vampire with a consecreted bat. Avoid this film at all costs. Having known then what I knew now would have been a heavenly revelation."
3,Chain,"Attractive Sterling Silver 1 MM Italian Box Link Chain 14"" 16"" 18"" 20"" 22"" 24"" 30"" Necklacethis is a very nice chain i ordered the 24"" and i like it"
2,Lasted for TWO Months...not so STURDY afterall,This chain is lovely but apparently VERY delicate. After two months it fell away from my neck. The link that holds the clasp broke... I guess I'll be purchasing a new chain. FYI - this chain held a very tiny cross which caused no tension on the chain.I'll get a more sturdy chain. I gave it two stars...one for each month of service :) Just sayin...
3,Nice but cheap,You get what you pay for. It looks nice but the clasp is super cheaply done the part it hooks on is barely big enough to fit it in. I would pay a little more for a nicer one.
4,"pretty, simple, right length","livraison rapide, joli emballage, bonne longueur, très brillante et fine.Bon produit pour quelqu'un qui recherche une chaine toute simple."
4,Decent chain for the $$,This was a decent product for the money. It worked perfectly with the pendant I attached. It shipped quickly and was boxed for gift giving
1,Broke within month,Broke within month. I wore it only a couple of times. It was well taken care of. Such a waste of money.
5,"Great chain, great price",I was impressed by the quality of this silver chain. Love it! Would recommend to a friend. Plus it arrived early.
2,Broke,"I ordered this, and was happy to look at it when I received ,however just after the use of a month or so it broke off.i wish it could have been more sturdy."
5,Great basic silver box chain,"I purchased this chain because I was looking for a simple silver box chain in a longer length. This product, offered by Gem Avenue, looked to be of good quality based on the other reviews, came in a variety of lengths, and was priced affordably. When I received the chain, I was pleased with the appearance, and so far, it has met my expectations. The only thing that I would mention is that this chain has a spring-type clasp--this is accurately noted in the description, but the photograph here appears to be of a chain with a lobster-type clasp. The latter would have actually been a nice small added feature, and for this reason, I would give this chain 4 1/2 rather than a full 5 stars. Other than that, however, I am pleased with this purchase and would recommend it."
5,Great for Price,"Need a simple necklace that looks attractive and has a nice clasp that doesn't break or cause you trouble? This is it.The chain isn't as thick as I originally thought, but that is credited to my ignorance with jewelry and how big 1MM is. However, the 24"" length has worked out perfectly as a simple necklace to wear I would highly recommend this to anyone.It makes a great small and inexpensive gift that can still be appreciated."
2,Pretty but very fragile,"The necklace was as pictured, but was very fragile and my son has already broken it after less than a week. The clasp did not spring closed automatically, and apparently it opened while he was wearing it, fell off, and was stepped on and broke. I guess you get what you pay for! I would only recommend it for a very cautious child with a very thin neck. I should have returned it due to the clasp before it was broken."
2,Thin Chain,"Item did not accurately match description. Item was much smaller in size than anticipated. I had bought it for my 7yr old daughter to wear with her charm. Because of its frail nature, I'd suspect by the end of the month, the chain would have broken under the weight of my daughters small necklace charm."
2,Cheap and flimsy,"I bought this to wear with a pendant my daughter gave me for my birthday. I want to wear the pendant on a daily basis, and I am allergic to nickel, so this appealed to me. In the picture, the chain has a more substantial weight and deeper silver color.In reality, this is a cheap looking chain, thin, too shiny, and easily crimped just by storage in a box. It doesn't make me break out, but I doubt I'll be breaking it in, either. This is what I get for buying jewelry online; the picture is better than the reality."
3,clasp wouldn't stay closed,"The chain looks nice, but when you open the clasp, it doesn't close immediately. You have to force it closed. I was a little disappointed by this, and will be requesting an exchange. Otherwise, it shines nicely and chain seems sturdy."
5,Great Product for the Price,"I'm not sure what people are expecting when you pay less than $10 for a chain, but what I received were some delicate, beautiful chains meant to be worn for occasions with a pendant, not everyday rough use. Thanks for the timely shipping and nice product."
3,So tiny,This chain is dainty and small. Its a nice chain. I always liked the box chain since it doesnt catch on clothing or hair. I purchased this for my 8 year old but the length was too short for her. So I ended up returning it.
1,Low Quality and Useless Item,"~~DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM~~I bought this for my girlfriend and she wore it for about an hour before it broke off and disappeared somewhere on my school campus. Luckily, the charm she put on it fell into her shirt so we did not lose that. For an item with 250+ 5 star reviews, THIS ITEM IS TERRIBLE and NOT WORTH YOUR MONEY OR TIME. I contacted Amazon and they were unable to give me a replacement. Worst $10 ever spent and I have bought a lot of stupid things in the past"
1,Possibly fake,I bought 2 refills BUYER BEWARE you will not be able to return these as they are considered HAZMAT so both the boxes have the unique code that Thierry Mugler parfums always come with cut out and tape has been placed over them. This is pretty bad and I will not be buying perfum again from here. Not worth saving just 4 dollars which is what the difference was
1,Bad Purchase,I was so excite to recieve the CD . I play the first one and to my suprise it got stuck and start skipping. I play another one and it did the same. I was very very disappointed at this time want my money back . I couldn't send it back it will cost me more than what it worth. So I stuck with them.
2,will make you think,Sit back and be ready to be blown away. Will make you think. You will never see people in the same way!!
4,Well worth the effort,"This tribute to Mississippi John Hurt is one that I keep gravitating back to and giving ""nuther listen to"". The artists (save perhaps one) are impressive in their interpretation of John's wonderful witty and humorous music. Those last two qualities seem to be the only thing that they just couldn't copy that Mr Hurt seasoned his works with so naturally. My ear always ""trips over"" Victoria Williams ""Since I've Laid My Burden Down"". Her performance is done in a style that is more suited to the Bulgarian Womens Choir. I loved the Taj Mahal performance of ""My Creole Belle"" and Geoff Muldaurs ""Chicken""."
4,"nice, but not sansa's style",I got this and It came with custom sizing options. It did not come with the sizing option for my sansa Fuze. So it didn't fit all that well. This is like a quick set up for a party because it boosts the sound volume very adequately. My sansa fuze isn't really set up for that kind of a thing so it was a little wasted as a simple charging dock. One thing I worried about was whether it would fit the plug. IT FITS my SAnsa Fuze! the blue LED on indicator light is really bright. It is like a really small high quality night light and really annoying to me especially as I sleep. It is not in an easy place to simply cover it up either. I ended up just unplugging it at night.
3,Entertaining and a really quick read.,"For some reason I love to find weird laws that make no sense in the present day. This book is full of them.The author actually gives a reasoning behind one of the laws in the book, and it was quite interesting to learn why that law was enacted. I wish that there had been that kind of background info for all the laws, but being that I'm pretty sure this was a kids book I think it would have been too much.It was a quick read (literally took me 10 mins.) The laws that were given kind of just make you think, why would they even need to make that law. Entertaining to read."
3,Well-intentioned (but hit-and-miss) album,"""Moonshadow: The Bluegrass Tribute"" is an interesting concept, as the back cover attests: ""It is only fitting that the timeless music of Cat Stevens...should now be expertly captured in a musical style which has remained unchanged by time."" On the first half of the record, this marriage is fairly amicable, and the CD as a whole makes for a great listen when driving through open country on a sunny day. Tracks like ""Sitting,"" however, fail to capture the endearment that was so centered upon Stevens voice, while ""Father And Son,"" seems to lose the melody and turn into pleasant but unidistinguished picking entirely.Some nice surprise contributions come from Tom Ball's harmonica playing on ""Peace Train"" and ""Where Do The Children Play,"" and main musician David West clearly has respectable investment in the material. It's just a bit too much of a well-intentioned idea."
2,Just doesn't work,"I own four Cat Stevens CD's and bluegrass is my favorite style of music, but the two just don't work together. Cat Steven's songs are best when simple and clean. Piano and guitar work best; especially when combined with Steven's voice and lyrics.Just too much twang in this album. The fiddle doesn't work and when the banjo and mandolin are going at the same time; it just sounds like noise. Bluegrass is great for someone like the Grascals, Cherryholmes, or Rhonda Vincent--but it doesn't sound right with simple folk singer like Cat Stevens."
4,It actually swings....,"I became a Dolby fan way in the real early 80's when I came across the 12 inch of ""Get out of my mix""..like so many cuts during that period I thought it was a 1 off wonder then years later he hits me with ""She blinded me with science"" and I was hooked all over again. As I danced untill I dropped to ""Airhead"" Now I sit back and snap my fingers to ""I love you goodbye' and ""Silk Pajamas"" I've enjoyed just abut all his works and this one ranks in my top 10...a must for TD fans..."
2,Rusts after few uses,Both inserts started rusting after 4-5 uses.I would expect a steamer insert to be of food quality stainless steel that withstands high temperature.
5,If your into any type of hip hop you need this dvd,Wow!history of hip hop in the truest.lessons on how to scratch.deep looks into the thoughts of famous dj's.excellent production.Cop this Dvd ... NOW!
1,Do NOT buy this OR any other Sony TV,"Inside of a year I had to have this TV repaired three times. I had the TV replaced based on the lemon law. I was givien the newer model, the KP43-T90. Now it too has broken. I don't mean that it doesn't work correctly. I mean that it doesn't work, period. The TV repair shop has now had it for two weeks and so far they don't know what other circuit to replace. Looks like I'm stuck with another lemon."
3,"Twinings Darjeeling Tea, Loose Leaf-Pack of 6 3.5 oz Tins","Loose leaf or remnants? Confused and disappointed after tasting. As a lover of aromatic pure darjeeling tea for the last 65 years - I ask myself, should I write a review for this highly publicized item !! It's a judgement call."
5,"Very easy to follow haircutting instructions, great!",I read this book and was cutting my son's hair that same day. Easy to understand lessons.
1,Not a Stand-Alone Book,"This book might be OK as a supplement to a haircutting course, but one sure couldn't learn haircutting with it alone. It's just a 40 page teaser, leaving you with many more questions than it answers."
4,ok for entry level,"For an entry level instrument, this is OK - case is flimsy and instrument is lightweight, but you get what you pay for."
1,no noriginal,the razor blades whose it n'ont distorts not manufactured by gillette and I wish to be refunded.
4,Roy,This unit is very easy to use and makes the world of difference on the steaks you cook. I have used it one time so far and can sure tell the difference. Would recommend this unit for the smaller ones.
5,Will never do without one again.,"I love this product!!! And the price makes it something I will purchase again and again when necessary. I used to stab my beef with a fork or knife but that would cramp my hand. This product works just fine, I don't know why the other products are so expensive nor do I understand the need to have 40 something spikes but whatever I am happy with what I got. If you are not sure about a meat tenderizer I say try this one for starters and then move up if necessary."
3,Rather shiny..,The material was not what I had in mind. You can't tell from the picture but it is too shiny to be used during the day. Even for a night out it is too dressy. It's only for special occasions.
4,Good product,This is one of those things that you don't think you need until you actually make pasta and realize that it is good to hang on something. I am very happy with the product.
5,Dry your pasta!,This small tool allows you to dry your pasta without losing counter space.Great idea for small kitchens!It is easy to set up and take down and easily fits back into the box.
1,Smells so terrible it's unusable!,"Although this does what it's supposed to do, it smells so horribly musty (as if it had been in a moldy warehouse for 50 years) that I don't even use it for fear it will affect the pasta. I tried washing it and airing it outside but nothing helped. Then I submitted packaging feedback but no one answered my response. Poor service..."
1,Wood is chemically treated,"Please, be aware that the wood is chemically treated. By mistake, I washed one of the drying sticks. It spread a very intensive chemical smell. I am not sure if you want that these chemicals will be absorbed by your healthy homemade pasta :("
2,Break!,We've bought three of these and they always break. The screw between the base and the upright strips or something and it wobbles like a sailor after two pints of rum.Boo.
3,Pure Campy Fun,"If you are looking for serious scares, don't bother with ""Mega Snake"". If however you are a fan of those old Creature Features that used to play on the UHF channels every Saturday afternoon, then ""Mega Snake"" should be right up your alley. ""Mega Snake"" makes the most of it's low budget with some decent casting, and great settings, and a better than expected story. While the CGI snake isn't exactly terror inducing, it isn't half bad either. The F/X are on par with the bigger budget ""Snakes on a Plane"", and like that film, ""Mega Snake"" doesn't take itself too seriously. It's a great B-Movie, perfect for a fun night with friends to make fun of, or better yet, since it's a TV movie with no nudity or adult language, it's perfect to watch with the kids. (Yes..I don't mind my children watching people get decapitated by a giant snake...but please don't show any boobies or cuss while it's happening)."
2,Ill-organized ramblings,"I bought this book with a lot of expectations. However it turned out to be 200 pages of anecdotes, which lose their charm after the first twenty pages. If I had followed the carnal rule of reading the contents list before buying a book, I would not have made this mistake. I admit there is a good book scattered somewhere in those 200 pages. But the author has to pay better attention to the organization. He could recount the same anecdotes under a thematic framework based on the principles of marketing."
3,Windows Server 2003 R2 review,"I was wrong, sorry. I wanted to buy a book about Windows server 2003 in first time, not the upgrade revision for SP1 and R2. but do not care, the next time I will must check carefully the guide on the book that I want to buy. Guys, do not make the same error like me."
5,Worth singing about...,"Anyone who's a parent, a child, a human being - will be uplifted by this wonderful story about courage, compassion, and strength."
3,Not as pictured & non-stick peels,"I've had this roasting rack for a few years now. It works fine in terms of being adjustable and holding up my chicken or turkey but the non-stick coating started peeling after only a few uses. Also, I specifically bought this particular one because in the picture, it looks like the little grooves (where the adjustable rack sits, on the rectangular base) have hooks/claws/bent metal pieces so that once the rack is in place, it can't be easily adjusted to another setting. However, there aren't actually any hooks on the base (it looks more like the Norpro 275 Adjustable Roast Rack) - they are just grooves for the adjustable part to sit in. Annoying."
3,120v input,"I bought this to take overseas and use with 220v power, but it works only 110/120v. It's a drawback that this isn't clear in the technical details - even Philips' own website doesn't say. I had found another online retailer that said it was 110/220, but that turned out to be inaccurate.(I picked 3 stars just for the lack of information. The unit might be perfectly OK. Unfortunately I won't be able to use it.)"
5,barry cd's,The live concert was mailed quickly and was a good value.Difficult to find elsewhere.If you are a Manilow fan you will enjoy this.
1,horrible,"i really don't see what is so ""AWESOME"" about this book. it .... the ending especially .... the only way i would actually be able to enjoy this book is by getting really drunk and bored. bad mix. the book's story line is very uninteresting and it seems like the whole book is written in a monotone kind of way (if that's possible). oh well... if you're looking for a good read this is not the book. look elsewhere."
3,The songs are ok,"The only really song that was good is the Kiss Kiss song. The song track number 3 would be my second fav. Its kind of got a Turkish beat to it and her voice is like no other. She's definitly got talent and a good voice though I have to say. When I first heard the song Kiss Kiss on Mtv I liked it, however when I listened to the amazon samples of the cd I wasn't real impressed with the other cd songs. Well If I was consitering getting this cd I think that I would only get the single, Kiss Kiss because the rest just doesn't sound to good. Plus #4 is really bad in my opinion."
1,Who writes this chick's lyrics?,"I really can't stand this new ""Kiss Kiss"" song. Sure, it has an awesome beat--actually, the beat is taken from a Turkish song, ""Simalik,"" by Tarkan. The song has been huge everywhere but in the US, and even if you have no clue what he's saying, his lyrics are bound to be better than these. Don't waste your cash on this cd--buy the Tarkan version instead."
5,As Magical as an Ocean Rain,"i still remember listening to this with the drummer of a band i was in back in '85, and being completly hooked...from the cover of the album to the sweeping notes of track #1- silver...man, i was hooked. echo...a band that just sounded mysterious...music you could just get lost in....it just sort of had a swirling effect on me...and it still does. nocturnal me, track #2, is so wonderfully complex, you'll hit repeat quite a few times. i've been listening to this album for about 17-years, and it sounds just as good now as it did then. still holds that eerie, mysterious, yet glowingly atmospheric sound that is undeniably echo & bunnymen. great lyrics...great music....great rhythm section...great guitar. trust me, this album will change you."
2,Disappointing,"I am trying to like this album, but it's not going to happen. You wouldn't know it's the Bunnymen without McCulloch's voice. No great hooks like in ""Rescue"", ""Never Stop"", or ""Lips Like Sugar"". Has to be their weakest early album and I am sorry I bought it. Still like the Bunnymen for their other works."
1,Useless,"Unless your child is having a Tea Party with her dolls, don't waste you money. Product ID is vague to the point of misleading. I purchased them so I could scoop out my dry pet food, instead when they arrived I couldn't even use any of them (3 in all) to scoop out flour or sugar from a canister. TINY......................................... great for your kids play kitchen set. NOT why I purchased them. As far as price is concerned, if any of them cost more than 50 cents a piece, I'll eat my hat. BUYER BEWARE!"
1,Lost it on first use,Be careful! Screwed it into the tripod fitting with the plastic screw (included)as directed. My husband lost it the first time he used it--evidently the screw does not hold well and the pouch fell off unbeknownst to him. Waste of $$$$.
2,Umm...shocking.,"Ok, so we all know Fatboy Slim's style. The thing is, this album kind of put it into overcharge. While it should be positively littered with wonderful songs, it just...isn't.Firstly, he delves into outright annoying montony. ""Slash Dot Dash"" should be an exciting song, but the fast-paced spoken words continue on and on into ""Please turn this stuff off"" territory. That pretty much follows through on all songs. It is hard to find a place to just chill on this album.I give it SOME credit though, as if the monotony was taken back a bit, it would be OK. Mostly just annoying. I am disappointed. ""It's Been A Long Way, Baby"" is a MUCH better album."
3,Adequate,"For fans of Fatboy's older stuff, the second half of this CD may come as a bit of a shock. He has the usual bombastic beats in Tracksa 1-5, but then goes into other styles, including an inexpliacble cover of Steve Miller Band's ""The Joker"".I'm all for artists growing, but on this album, Fatboy Slim's beats just aren't all that interesting. I guess hardcore fans may enjoy it, but I did not."
2,Damaged tin!,"I always have good luck with Amazon, but one of the ""gift tins"" of the loose Twining's Tea arrived dented. I immediately emailed Amazon and have not heard anything until today. Obviously, I cannot give this tin as a gift do to the dents that occured in shipping, either to Amazon or to our home. I've saved the tin if you would like to send a call tag or give me credit for one tin. I would appreciate some kind of reply from you!"
3,"It's Ok, still searching for a great Mexican Cook Book",I was a little disappointed by this cookbook. It did have some good information in it but I was looking for more variety and more detail. There are plenty of recipes to try but this seems better for someone only looking to lightly dabble in Mexican cooking.
5,Very lovely fish,This fish is noticeably beautiful with the polka dots and her bright red lips. She is so soft and cute and I was very pleased when I received her. I collect beanie babies and she is one of my most beautiful and my favorite fish beanie by far.
4,Creative Filter Set,"Get your scissors, cut, design and think creativity, With this set of acetate filters, you can create any shape in any color you like and match your filters precisely to your subject and your imagination. Dream and create two, three or four colors in the same image, arranged as you likeHelpful hints : Handle the cut out fitters carefully and place them in the gelatin Holder (194), one of which is supplied with the Cokin Creative set. You may need several Modular Hoods (255) to protect the filters against the weather : check that the hoods do not vignette the image. These filters do not offer the optical quality of classical filters and cannot replace them for all applications."
3,fun filter,"It's a novelty when used here and there. It is fun for some shots. My 20 month old daughter giggles everytime she sees her picture with the rainbow. (beyond that, yeah, they're useless)"
2,Predictable.,"Pretty much the old Caddy Shack plot that we've seen a hundred times before.However, Brooke Shields still looks pretty good. Funny movie...if you're twelveyears old."
1,Very strong scent.,"I bought this from the reviews I read. My husband thought it was a scent he had remembered from long ago and wanted to try it out. It was really not to my liking. It reminded me of a much older woman who would wear it. Gave it away already to a ""Grandma"""
5,My mothers favorite,I have been buying this for my mom for years and this was an excellent price for it. Best price anywhere on the market!
5,A beautifully told story of redemption.,"This was one of my favorite books of all time. A wonderful story of a strange man in a strange place. And, again, like The Shipping News, it's also about Newfoundland. I know people who read this book in one sitting. I loved it almost as much"
3,"Some lines are gems, but far from Proulx's Newfoundland.","I tried to immerse myself in Norman's Newfoundland, but Fabian and Margaret were wooden to me. There were occasional metaphors that were simply arresting (one was a comparison of birds on a telephone wire to an abacus), but I wanted more of these figurative devices. I guess some of the best description lay in the chapter depicting the Guy Fawkes Day celebration. I don't know, I'd have liked more richness in the descriptions; Norman lays the groundwork--great town, potentially striking characters, but the narration does not reach."
3,The birds are the best part,"I didn't finish this so maybe I missed the redemption part -- but Fabian is so passive, but suddenly not so passive as to murder a man -- manipulated by Margaret (who provides the gun and the direction ) and Margaret is the ""alive"" one, our heroine? Couldn't find a character I was interested in. Newfoundland and the birds are perfect. People were dead to me. The writing is great, this was done purposefully, so it may just be my impatience but in light of all the great reviews I had to log in on this."
2,Lively book.,"As a Newfoundlander and novelist I was delighted by Norman's book. The names of the locals are different than I have known, and in my experience, most Newfoundlanders drink more tea than coffee, but the characterization is original, the dialogue is clever, and the book flows at a lively pace that holds your interest and sweeps you away. Great job.Note: I tried to give it five stars, but a glitch permitted just two. It's five stars all the way."
1,A Bird Dive,"This book was horid. It had as much suppense as that Al Pacino movie ""Insomnia"" (which is none). After reading it I honestly was bummed that I wouldn't be able to get that valuable time in my life back."
4,good for me.,"I have a mild form of muscular dystrophy, therefore shouldn't exert, so it is great for me."
2,Shorter than expected,"This DVD was somewhat shorter in length than I expected. I think the descriptions of the exercises should have been more detailed, e.g., keep head straight, lift foot 6 inches off floor, etc. The counting of the exercising was definitely not thorough enough and sometimes was a little hard to follow/keep up for elderly audiences. I would definitely look to buying one from a different trainer next time."
3,Great Book!,"I really enjoyed reading this book. I have read books by Shari Anton before and just loved them. She takes me to a world i only dare dream about and one that i find exciting and romantic. I hope to read more of her books in the future. Although this is not one of the best books i have ever read, i still highly recommend it."
5,Snoopy Vs. the Red Baron,"I bought this for my 7-year-old after reading a book about Snoopy and the Red Baron. He had never heard the song before and so I ordered this cd. It took a while to get to our house, but he hasn't stopped listening to the cd (the whole thing) since. Even the neighbor kids are enjoying it."
1,An Old I*dea In Need of Renewal,"For the ""evangelical Christian,"" this book will prove well-worth reading. The same message needs restating in terms 21st-century believers would find relevant to their daily lives."
1,Too Contrived for Me to Finish,"In the first few pages of this book, our heroine discovers a corpse hanging from the ceiling while attempting to deliver a package to said corpse. There's also a mysterious man standing near the body. The man steals the package while our heroine is mooning over how handsome he is. Then our heroine trips and falls and catches herself by grabbing hold of the body, where her hand just happens to land on the murder weapon, still in the body. She inadvertently removes the murder weapon just as the police walk in and see her standing there with a bloody knife.I can't tell you what happens after that, because at this point, I threw the book across the room. The whole set-up to the book was so contrived that I didn't want to read any more.If the situation above sounds like fun to you, by all means, go to it. It wasn't my cup of tea."
1,Stupid,"These books slay me. How this sort of rubbish gets published I'll never know. AND why do I read them? I should have learnt from last time. **Sigh**A Silly shallow story about Aisling Grey, a supposed Guardian who is a Wyvern's Mate. Of course not any Wyvern but the Leader of the Green Wyvern (Do Heroines EVER love the Janitor?) The Plot is thin at best and it kills me that trees died for this drivel. Very poor quality 4/10"
1,Not a book for newf fans,"The writer is great with dialog and funny prose but she really missed them mark by casting a newf as the demon. As if that wasn't bad enough the newf does not even have newf characteristics, which could have been inserted...really bad premise. If you do buy the book start reading around page 88 for enjoyment the first 88 pages are dry and unnecessary waste of time. Really disappointing."
4,A lot of fun,I thought this book was a lot of fun - plenty of humor and a solid plot. The characters kept me entertained and it was different than a lot of the paranormal books that I've read in the last few years. That's important because sometimes it feels like a lot of them are recycling the same old plot lines. You Slay Me is fresh and intriguing and a great read.
5,TRULY ENCHANTING SPELL KIT!,"I got this The Wicca Spell Kit as a gift from my sister and I was so pleased because I had just finished reading Sirona Knight's Faery Magick book. I started doing the spells the same day I received the kit, and I was very happy with the results. Everybody interested in doing magick will love this complete spell kit. I recommend it and have purchased 3 more Wiccan Spell Kits for Yule presents this year."
5,Apple Time!,"As a collector of apple items, I was happy to find this Norpro Red Apple Timer. It adds a touch of whimsy to my kitchen. I like to use it when cooking rice pilaf or garlic bread because I don't like the sound of the loud buzzer on my kitchen range. Norpro makes similar timers in other cute shapes: tomato, white egg, chicken, and chef."
2,Norpro Red Apple Timer,"I purchased this item in March of 2010, and I just threw it away because it stopped working completely. I realize that it was not a high ticket item, but for something that was used maybe twice a week, I did expect a little longer life for it."
2,Interface panel not needed...,This expensive panel although would do the job it is simply not needed.If you are remotely mounting the inverter like i did i just used a telephone line coupler(just a few dollars)to connect the inverter to your LCD panel via telephone cable. Happy inverting!!
2,"Save the dough, unless you want the Tracy documentary","Look, the one reviewer says it right: ""Woman of the Year"" and ""Adam's Rib"" as this screen duos best. Not a clue where one reviewer got ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner?"" After all, any respectable cinephile knows that this was an overrated piece of hogwash, brought to the screen by the ""great"" Stanley Kramer, the director of sappy 50s social commentary-and sadly at the helm of many of Tracy's last works. The only thing that film has going for it is the strong cast-totally wasted on this script, though. A better third installment would be ""Desk Set"" or ""Without Love"". If you like ""Pat and Mike"" enough, though, this price is nearly the same as buying the three separately-so you get the documentary for free. Go for it!"
2,Not realistic,"The photo makes this wound look more realistic than it is. The package claims to be Hollywood Quality, but I definitely do not see it that way."
2,Kindle version not very good,"I paid $18.99 for this Kindle edition ($20.51 with tax), and for that much, excuse me, I think I'm entitled to a well-formatted electronic edition. This was not. It had NO table of contents, so it was impossible to jump to the glossary when needed. There were numerous formatting errors (mysterious colons in the middle of sentences, spaces in the middle of words, other words run together, etc.), and most of the drawings and tables didn't make it into the book at all. Just big blank spots.I'm going to stop buying any Kindle books if they can't be produced more carefully. I'm getting tired of these sloppy quick-and-dirty ebook transfers that are riddled with errors. In a large, scholarly work like this, I expect to be able to access the glossary and the index while I read. Without that, the Kindle Experience is nowhere NEAR the experience of reading a ""real book""."
5,A Thorough Look at the Vikings,"I loved this book, because it lets you get in touch with the vikings psychologically. One can understand their ways after reading this book. Aside from this, it is an enjoyable read! Adventurous, intriguing, and inspiring!"
4,"Hard to close but when you get it, it works!!!",I got these as a Christmas gift 2007 and used them for my trip to Mexico in May 2008. It is hard to get them to seal but once you do they really work. I am a plus size person so my clothes take a lot of room. I was able to pack for 8 days and use one suit case! It was fabulous! My friends couldn't beleive I was able to take as much as I did with only one bag. Just be careful not to go over the 50 lbs baggage weight limit!! I highly recommend these. Fight the fight to get them closed because it's worth it!! I'm back to buy my Mother a set for our cruise this coming May 2010.
2,Dud,"The timer may work just fine, but when the water in the pan is boiling, I can't see the reading on this thing. If I can't see the information, it might as well be missing all together. I'll stick to a standard timer for now."
1,"Smells like chemical, insides peeled / cracked after first use","I rarely ever write reviews. But in this case I feel like I should chime in to help save others the hassle.Upon my first use, the inside surface has peeled off / cracked somehow. Not only does this concern me from a safety perspective, but it makes it very hard to read the hard/medium/soft words inside. The whole thing smells like chemical as soon as I dropped it into the pot with my egg. Highly defective and unsafe. One of my worst purchases ever. I will try to post a photo later.I just want to save others the hassle of dealing with this product. Unless you don't mind your kitchen smelling like chemical, or your eggs smelling / tasting like chemicals."
1,Disappointed,"Thought I'd give it a try. I think I'll stick with my old fashioned hour glass style egg timer. If you put it into a deeper pot with lots of eggs, good luck trying to see it clearly when the water's at a rolling boiling. It also turned a dark red and that made it harder for these older eyes to read. Nope, this thing is not for me......"
3,Works but smells,I too have experienced the buring plastic smell. I've only used mine twice but it filled the kitchen with a stench that took several hours to clear. I've no idea what ended up in my egg!I'm hopeful that this will be a temporary problem and it did seem better the second time. The timer seems to work well but it seemed more like 10 minutes as I felt I had to stand and watch it :o)
1,"Didn't work for me, KITCHEN JUNK","So many things wrong with this item. The ""Soft"" marker is so close to the edge you can't read it accurately. It got cloudy when used a second time. It made an putrid chemical smell when in hot water. If an egg got a slight crack in it I don't think you'd want to eat the egg based on the smell of the water.Even if it worked you would need to stand over it and watch it.Some people seem to like it so maybe I had a bad one. As always, Amazon was good about a refund."
5,Egg Timer,Don't leave it in the boiling water after eggs are done.This is our 3rd one due to not removing it soon enough.It turns black and stays that way if you leave it in too long.
4,Takes the quessing out of cooking boiled eggs.,"I really like this egg timer. My eggs are cooked perfectly. Unfortunately it isn't very durable, but I like it so much I bought another one."
2,Not the best for me,"This does not preform to my expectations, but then again maybe i am not using it the way it was intended to be used. I would not recommend purchasing this product. It remains the same color regardless of how I use it."
4,It works!,This egg timer is great. It works. The only thing is you have to keep a watch on it yourself because there is no noise to let know the time is up. I wish I'd gotten one a long time ago.
2,Poor design,Egg timer completely delaminates apart. Top and bottom layer have separated so the color change element doesn't work at all.
4,Works exactly right,"Yes, this works.When I am making hard boiled I wait until just before the whole timer turns dark, when there is still a very small oval of red in the center, maybe a couple centimeters wide, turn off the heat and let the eggs sit just a minute or so longer, then plunge them into a bath of ice water and viola! perfect hard boiled eggs, no dark ring around the yolks.To avoid overcooking the eggs, cook them only until the timer is dark and don't leave them on any longer.For breakfast eggs on an egg cup the Medium time is perfect if you want to dip a little toast in them.The fresher the egg, the better the taste.Enjoy!"
3,"Works, but smells","This product does indeed work, and I found that I had been overcooking hardboiled eggs by three minutes. However, it makes the water, your kitchen, and even the outside of the eggs reek of plastic.Now that I've learned, using the egg timer, exactly how long it takes to cook eggs, I'll probably cease using it because of the smell."
5,Who Needs Unplugged ?,This CD represents extraordinary value for money. Dire Straits' most brilliant songs performed and recorded even more brilliantly. Don't tell me music wasn't more exciting back then...
3,Alchemy - Dire Straits Live- old records,"I think the old and masterized records prevent we hea the pure sound. But it`s normal.for this kins of records. Trully, I liked of musics but yhe quality of sound it's not the best. Just it."
1,Poor Sound Quality,I purchased this cd after hearing the Sultans of Swing version on youtube. I was very disappointed in the sound quality on the cd.
2,disappointed,"Very disapointing many songs i liked weren't even on the CD, maybe 2 good songs total. Waste of my money!"
4,makita does it again,"I was impressed with the Makita air compressor. After years of using Makita saws, I was surprised to find a compressor, but I shouldn't have been. The name alone was enough to make me stop for a closer look. Never had any problem from any Makita product."
4,glad i did,this was more of a remebrence item for me i grew up on a hog farm so i just wanted something that helped bring back memories nice item glad i got it
5,Good product,"I don't use it much, but it is nice and heavy and easy to clean. I use it for pressing chicken breast rather than bacon."
1,Poor design,"I should have read previous reviews more carefully instead of just reading the specifications. This press is actually shorter than a piece of bacon. The embossed pig emblem and words ""bacon press"" makes it very unappealing. The other little nooks and crannies make it difficult to clean. It actually works better as a press for grilled sandwiches more so that a bacon press."
4,Light and flavorful,I like the light touch of citrus in this tea. I think it's very enjoyable any time during the day or evening.It's favorful
2,Not English tea,"When my tea bought in London ended I bought this tea in supermarket. What a disappointment! The tea is tasteless and very weak compared to the British equivalent. I ordered the same tea from Twinings.com, which came direct from England. It is in a black box. The tea I got from the official site steeps properly and has a much more distinct taste than this American version."
4,Sturdy but bowed,"This cady seems to keep from rusting and feels like it remains steady and strong in the shower. It holds large, heavy, bottles of shampoo and conditioner in its baskets. Each basket went into place as directed and is holding is place, not slipping down the pole of breaking off. The pole was difficult to install, but has stayed in place perfect since I put it up. The only down fall is the middle seems to bow out just a tiny bit from the tension. It doesnt seem to have harmed the product or made it less sturdy, but it is a small eye soar."
3,Just Ok,There were 3 or 4 good songs on this album so unless your buying a used one for $5 don't waste your money.
4,Genius! Superb!,"Don't listen to negative reviews of this masterpiece-- Joe's Apartment is genius, genius, genius. It's tough to articulate it better than that. If you're still squemish about bugs, stay away, but for everyone else, jump in w/ both feet and be pleasantly surprised."
4,Joe's Apartment is an inane but highly humorous comedy!,"MTV was very clever to think up a movie that contains quite a few musical numbers performed by cockroaches! I think the movie was funny, stupid, and a little bit romantic. This is the best combination for a movie. I thoroughly enjoyed viewing this movie."
1,FLAWED DESIGN - GO ELSEWHERE,"BROKE - Despite the lower price, what is the point when it breaks so easily. After 2 years of light use, mine went disfunctional. Take the plastic cover off of the pressure relief apparatus and you will see how fragile the magnetic shut off and cheap plastic push button switch are. I'm debating on learning how to fix, replace or just go out and buy something designed a bit simpler. My unit keeps cycling and won't hold pressure."
4,oil cap pops up?!,whenever I start the compressor the oil cap pops up and splashes the oil out. Probably a pressure is building in but why?
3,bad thermol protector,the compressor works great but the thermol protector is not very strong and wore out in just over a year. Do not plug the compressor into an extention cord. I had it plugged into a 12/2 cord and it still drew to much power for it and shorted it out. Plug it right into the wall and run longer hoses instead of an extention cord.
2,design flaw,"I bought 2 of these compressors - one for me and one for my son. Each of our compressors has failed in the identical fashion, his multiple times. I think the basic compressor, i.e. the electric motor and vane compressor, is quite solid, but the control circuit which turns the motor on and off is quite cheesy and prone to failure. It is also *very* expensive to replace.Since this has happened to us a total of 3 times now, this is not just a case of random failure, but is a systematic problem. A shame, too, because the rest of the tool seems quite robust. We are shopping for new compressors now. I can tell you one thing - they won't be Hitachi."
4,Learn or Re-Learn Chinese Jump Rope- fun for kids gatherings,"... ~ - ~~ My niece got this last year when she was ten, and brought it to a family party.The rope supplied with the set was the right size for the kids, and the illustrations were very clear.I had remembered playing Chinese jump rope as a child, but couldn't remember any of the games.The girls age 8-11, enjoyed playing, and even my mother and I jumped in!This is a nice set for a girl age 7-11 who has friends or cousins enough easily available to start a game.A nice guide, and entertaining at a children's gathering."
1,worst product ever,This was the worst product i have ever bought. The blade is dull and the machine was filthy!
1,Don't bother with this product,Save yourself a few dollars and chop up the ingredients yourself. Two speeds? Where? It turned my tomatoes (which I had cut into quarters as recommended) into mush without managing to chop a thing.
3,Powerful and depressing,"I just finished _Human Cargo_ and feel torn with my read. It is a depressing, albeit powerful read. Yes, she does make some erroneous statements that others noted including referring to El Cajon as being west of San Diego. It's actually East. She also noted that San Diego and Tijuana could be one city, which is woefully inaccurate. A map would show that she forgot about several cities between the two, even if this was a mere metaphysical type descriptor.What I'm most troubled with is that the increase in xenophobia and tightening of borderc compounded with the increase of refugees or asylum seekers really paints a sad picture. I'm glad I read it and her audience is definitely a general or lay audience.The stories about some of the refugees were absolutely haunting. Thankfully, next in my queue is a Baldacci book. I need a lighter read this next go around."
2,Accuracy suspect,"I read a few chapters of this book, and it struck me as well written and interesting. But then I got to the chapter on the Palestinians. Here the author talks about the Israeli Haganah lining up Palestinian families and shooting them dead. According to my Dad, who was part of the ""Stern Gang"", no such thing happened. She talks about other disasters that befell the Palestinians, without giving context. For instance, Kuwait expelled its Palestinian workers, but there was a reason. The Palestinians had welcomed the invasion of Kuwait by Iraq. Another disaster was when the Lebanese turned against the Palestinians. There was a reason for that too, the Palestinians had taken charge of the Southern Lebanon area and abused its inhabitants. The author should not be too credulous when talking with refugees."
3,....good deal....in case of need.,At the price I paid I did not expect any more. It will do should I need a raincoat. Insurance.
3,Beginner-level,"I ordered this book to find some useful hints and tips on astrological forecasting. However, there is nothing in this book that has not been written elsewhere. Yes, I was a little disappointed. There was really nothing new in it. However, if you are a beginner 'Mapping Your Future' gives a good overview on transits and progressions. The interpretations of the progressions and transits are kept (very) short. The enclosed CD-ROM calculates the transits and delivers a forecast report that you can print. The report was well-done but for advanced students it was way too general. Advanced students of astrology should not get this book. Stick to Bernadette Brady's Eagle and the Lark or Carol Rushman's The Art of Predictive Astrology. These two books are still the best."
4,little women next door,"This book is truly a good read. The only thing I didn't really like about it was that the girls in the book got a little too over enthusiastic over every little thing. The book is about a little girl who stutters and one day she meets neighbors. They make a school and area for their followers, Fruitland. The new neighbors are odd in the girl's poppa's point of view, but they are kind and help the girl over her stuttering problem."
4,Nice,Meaningful but joyful. I enjoyed this book. I wasn't sure I would like this book but I was wrong. I'm sure you will enjoy it as well
5,Bravo!,"This is a wonderful book. David Lee Garrison is a graceful, unfailingly accurate translator, capturing the wit and wisdom of one of Pedro Salinas's best collections. In a prologue, Salinas writes that ""poetry, like love, either conquers or ceases to exist."" This time it conquers!"
4,emotional,"This cd is mainly a live verson of some of their songs, although there are a few on here I don't think are on any other albums. Generaly speaking I do not like live versons of songs or cd's but I thought this was a very good cd. These songs weren't the same songs you hear on the albums but with screaming fans in the backround, no, these songs have a feel quite different from their album counter part. It is mainly a more emotional feel in my opinion, and I like it. There are longer crazier improvised guitar solos, more lyrics, and just more of the moment in the songs. If you are a casual pumpkins listener I don't think this is the album to get, but for any real pumpkins fan this is a must for your collection."
4,"A good mixer, does the job it was intended for","For the plusses, it does its job and it was inexpensive. The only minus is that the wire bar at the bottom is a little taller than my old one, so it does not get down to the bottom of the bowl quite as well. I'm still a bit undecided about the nylon gears. The small gears at the top of the beaters are nylon and I'm a little afraid they will strip or wear quickly. I guess only time will tell."
4,not a toy.... but a display figure,"details are great, finishes are well done. It is bigger than expected... but that is a good thing; especially for display pieces."
1,You Get What You Pay For,This toy is dangerous. The attachements do not sit securely in the base. They can and do pop out while you are slicing. I got a deep finger cut from this weapon.
4,Flameless LED Pillar Candle Garden Group,Nice Zen-like grouping. Too bad they didn't come with batteries.
5,Horrorock,"Unlike trendy lamer bands like Blink 182,Linkin Park and especially Limp biskit, Zombie's stuff is pure genius. His style and songs cater to the hardcore fans of Horror cinema,comics and even Anime. (In Supercharger Heaven you can hear him refer to the Go Nagai character Devilman.)this disc is a must buy for Zombieheads, even if you have all the previous recordings. one thing though, why didn't they include the song from the escape from from LA. soundtrack (The One)?Also recommended: Sexy swinging sounds and the Stripper CD."
5,Totally classic and genius music,"Mortician makes real music for real people, and they are unconcerned with what weak people may say about their music. Mortician laughs at all all the weak minded fools who are too inferior and stupid to understand the depth and brutality of this kind of music. Mortician is definitely one of the best brutal death metal bands of all time, and probably the most brutal band you can find on Amazon. Mortician got me into the world of the death metal underground, where the real quality bands are at. If you like Mortician I recommend: Retch, Cock and Ball Torture, Disgorge, Waco Jesus, Exulcerate, Prostitute Disfigurement, Putrid Pile, Anal Bleeding. Support the death metal underground."
1,Wow that is hilarious,"(...) First off, what the hell is up with the album cover? What kind of nutcase actually thinks, ""Hey, let's put some chick with a dismembered leg on the front of our album cover! Wouldn't that be AWESOME????!!!!"" Dude it's a chick without a leg! What's cool about that?Second, I actually found the ""music"" so bad it's funny! This sort of stuff would be really funny to suddenly blast at punk kids who try to take all the candy on Halloween. And the vocals? ""wooooooorrrrrrggggg woooooorrrrrgggggg raaaaahhhhhhrrrrrr yaaaahhhhhhgggg wooooooooorrrrrgggg"" is more or less what the vocals sound like.I would basically call this stuff metal muzak. (...)"
1,"Dumb, Dumb, Dumb","Mortician are one of the WORST bands to enter death metal. People compliment for their Gory, Brutal, Bloody Music. HOW CAN MUSIC BE BLOODY AND GORY!? UNLESS YOU RECORD SOMEONE BEING KILLED, IT'S NOT BLOODY OR GORY!!!!! Their music is dumb, they know about 3 chords, the lyrics are far from Poetry ""Meat Hook...Your Dead."" Very Redundant and stupid. I've heard people say that they just want to be the fastest band ever and the most ""gory"". SO WHAT!? No one cares if your extremely fast, it's the musical quality that counts. Nasum can play fast and still be musical. And I love how people say the drumming and voice is brutal when the lead singer isn't even pronunciating words (he's just sucking in words) and there's a drum machine. This album along with Dope should be in the Comedy section of every online and cd store."
1,Absolute crap,"Is this a joke? Awful death thrash with unintelligible cookie monster vocals, horrible production and a (gasp) drum machine. Not to mention the bonehead subject matter. Do yourself a favor, check out Carcass or Death."
3,YOU'LL PRAY FOR DEATH LONG BEFORE YOU DIE,This is a confused vampire movie. Dr. Elwyn Clayton is killed by his twin brother Dr. Lloyd Clayton (George Zucco with Harry S. Truman glasses) because he is into the black arts. His brother comes back to life (title is a hint) and is a vampire whose fangs we never see. He can also vanish like a ghost. Zolarr is his creepy man servant played by Dwight Frye aka Renfield.The intro of the man with his face in the fire was perhaps the best part of the film. Much of the acting was simply bad. Elwyn is slowly taking blood from Gayle Clayton (Mary Carlisle) described as the beloved niece of Lloyd Clayton. I would imagine she is Elwyn's niece too (normally works that way with twins) but the movie never mentions it. Her boyfriend was horribly played by Nedrick Young. And that's about it for 63 minutes.This is a movie made before twists and clever endings. Might have some camp value.
5,A timeless book,"This book is not only beautifully written and perfect for all ages, ""The Princess and the Goblin"" is also morally strong and uplifting. Children of either sex will be interested in it, with a loving and beautiful grandmother, a strong and intelligent young girl, and a young boy who is intent on protecting his loved ones and uncovering the evil goblin plot. I have read this countless times, and each time I discover something new. The sequel, ""The Princess and Curdie,"" is also worth reading. I love this book!"
3,Atlantis is Waiting!,"This is NOT your usual Disney score. It is fairly simple with no main theme but it makes up for that by always dishing out something new on each track. For example, The Submarine is triumphant and exciting as Milo's adventure is about to begin, while The Crystal Chamber is slightly tribal and mysterious for the discovery of the secret room. It does slightly fall flat if you are expecting a genuine action score. It is very soft in most places but it has SOME fast paced action. Overall, It's pretty good, minus that extremely boring song at the beginning. Ick!"
2,A very dry reading,"This book is very dry in its presentation of Ugandan history. Furthermore, I feel that this author skips over important details of Ugandan history such as the historical divide between north and south, which is a continual factor in the 21 year war with the LRA.If possible find another author for a historical review of Ugandan history."
3,For middle schoolers,"I donated this to my school library. Very few breeds are covered, and they didn't have the breed I owned, an English Shepherd."
2,Doesn't hold eggs!,"This product should have a few basic functions. It needs to be non-stick or attest not be sticky when it's greased, and be flat such that it holds the contents that are poured into it. It fails on the latter. I've spent 15 mins trying to get it to a point where it just barely works to hold eggs in when one is poured into it from the shell. Definitely not worth the time. I would not recommend this to anyone."
2,Out of date,I bought it due to the recommendations given on this very website and it was definitely informative but this book is in DIRE need of updating. Korea is changing VERY FAST and 1997 was before the current President (who is stepping down this month) was elected into office!
3,Not as good as the hype,I did it again. I fell for the pro reviews. It was an o.k. read but not great.
5,A book that makes you think,"This book is wonderful. It really makes you think about how you are living your life. Do not live it so that you will look back with regret. Live so that you can look back and be proud of what you did, who you've become - in spite of your mistakes."
5,Could this really happen?,"I was glued to this book from the first page to the last. Because the main character continues to replay those 25 years over and over, there is no wondering, ""What would have happened if he'd..............""? because we as the readers are allowed to see so many different outcomes. Mr. Grimwood's believable writing style makes me wonder if something like this could really happen or even if it is happening to someone right now. Could I be a part of someone's modified life?"
3,Unique concept,"This book started fast right out of the gate and I was hooked. The concept of this story was thought provoking and intriguing, however about half way through it really started to drag. The replay where Jeff and Pamela tried to find scientific answers as to what was happening to them and resulted in a complete change of history grew tiresome me. Overall it does make one think if put in the same situation how you would choose to live your life over again."
5,Superb Exploration of Second Chances,"Any book that begins with the main character dying young in the first paragraph is either going to be very bad or else go somewhere unusual. This book is unique and fascinating--The kind that nags and nags at you. It takes the old thought ""If only I could live my life over knowing what I know now"" and plays it out over and over. Having died middleaged with an unhappy marriage and a stymied career, our hero wakes up in college with his whole life before him. He promptly makes himself rich and famous but then he dies again and is reborn again. What makes the novel fascinating is that the author does not cheat. He does not stop. Our main character seems trapped in an endless time loop--or is he? Suddenly, new factors enter and...well, I won't spoil the plot. This is a must-read and would be a great novel for discussion."
2,Disappointing,"I wanted very much to like this book, being a reader who typically enjoys time-travel stories, but such was not the case. I found it to be choppy, largely unstructured despite the built-in chronology, and peopled with unconvincing characters. Jeff was okay, but Pamela was (to me, at least) thoroughly uninteresting. The dialogue throughout the book was authorese rather than the way real people talk, and the quite intriguing first half deteriorated into a morass of repetitive and boring mini-travelogues. Far from being ""in the tradition of Jack Finney,"" as the book jacket would have us believe, Replay was an amateurish mess. Don't waste your money and time."
5,Great read! And I never tire of re-reading it.,Very entertaining and thought-provoking novel! Brings forth feelings of both joy and melancholy. Makes you think about the values in your own life.
5,Probably my favorite book,"I wont bother going into a long description or anything here, that has without been done already in the 250+ other reviews. I just wanted to add a few comments because I absolutly love this book.This isnt SciFi, its is only slightly Science Fiction at all. There are no new gadgets or aliens or mutants or anything of that type. It is instead just a story about a man who finds himself repeating his life, and it didnt need to be anything more than that. While reading this book I constantly found myself thinking ""Yes I would do that, I believe that"".Do yourself a favor and give this a read, none of the people I have loaned my copy to have had anything but the highest of praise for it."
4,"Well written, but disturbing","ReplayIt goes beyond Groundhog Day, in a delicious horror-fantasy plot. ""Replay"" takes you back to that disturbing question: Has life any meaning at all?"
3,Couldn't wait for the end,"I know that I am in the minority, but I ended up being very disappointed with this book. It started out very strong, but by the end I couldn't wait for Jeff and or Paula to just die for good already! I did not find Jeff a very likeable character either. I won't recommend this one or read it again. I'm giving it 3 stars because the first half of the book was enjoyable."
3,Groundhog Day with longer time periods,Interesting -- I usually read books twice through back to back so I'll have a better grip of the story. This one only got one reading. Maybe another time it'll grab me harder. My wife loved it! Go figure.
2,Let down ending....,"I agree with most of the reviews - it was a great book. After many repetitions of the theme, I had to wonder where it was going. I am not going to spoil the ending, but will say that I was disappointed, apparently others were not. For me it was anti-climatic. It built up to a let down.There should have been some sort of explanation for the phenomena. Maybe the sequel will cover it, or the movie!?!?"
3,I liked this more than I thought I would...,"I really enjoyed the parts of this book that took the reader to Atlanta...This book moved really fast, I burned through it in 48 hours. I would recommend it highly."
4,A good read. Worth the time expended.,"As a fan of any type of time manipulation or ""what ifs"" , this story held my attention from cover to cover. I've reread this book twice! Unheard of in my hous"
5,THE JOURNEY IS THE DESTINATION,"couldn't put it down after my mother put it into my hand . without saying a word she just smiled and walked away, and i've had the pleasure of doing the same thing to about 25 people in the last few years, thanks Ken."
3,Could have been better!,"The Guyver series is a really good comic book and animated series. But for this movie they just really f@#ked it up. They made like a damn Power Rangers movie. If u really want to see the Guyver in action watch the sequel. And for the record on the movie cover I know it has Mark Hamill with half of his face with the Guyver's and people tell me he plays the Guyver. WRONG! Mark Hamill is the starring actor of this movie, Jack Armstrong plays the Guyver. But anyways, I give this movie 3 out of 5 stars."
2,"""Dreams"" should be softly caressing","After reading several reviews exalting the serenely beautiful music on this album, I didn't even hesitate to place an order...However, stated opinions neglected to say this album was comprisemed of mostly lilting Irish music and buyers should be made aware of that...I was anticipating an entirely soothing selection of heavenly music and was sadly disappointed."
3,Disappointment,"Secret Garden is a favorite group of mine. It has been awhile since they have had a new album ,so Dreamcatcher was a welcome addition to their three previous albums. This album is a great disappointment as it is simply a compilation of tracks from the earlier disks,with the addition of only one new song listed as a ""bonus track"",which is not even up to their standards.If you already own the other three I would not advise buying this,but if you are not familar with Secret Garden this is a very good introduction to them,as it does contain the best of their previous work."
5,bleach season 2,"I love this product, not only did I get the complete second season of bleach uncut, I got a nifty little poster and sticker. Behind each disc is a character quote and across from the disc is an image of one of the characters that is prevalent in that disc. The first season box was also like this. I can't wait until season 3 comes out in one of these boxesIf you are a Bleach fan this is a great buy. Don't pass it up!"
4,Bleach Season 2 boxset,"I remember when I bought Bleach Season 1 boxset without really knowing anything about Bleach. All I knew is that it was a long series (which i tend to look for and like) and I heard it was good. So I spent the money and got it and liked it. Finally Season 2 comes out and I got it as soon as I can. I really liked season 2 but...i didn't care for the two episodes that really didnt have to do with the rest of the story though I get it cause it gives ""more background"" on the people it's about but still. And also my only other problem is that some of the fighting scenes I think took a bit longer than it should have. All and all it was a good season...the ending really got me wanting more. Though when I first started watching it I wasn't too sure about this season but it did get better. I will just have to see what happens next when Season 3 gets released on DVD."
5,definately a winner book,If a new rt student this is perfect. It is condensed for the info that is really is needed.
5,bigfan,"Saw Max in concert during the ragtime resurgence in the 70's, these recordings bring it all back from the hands of the master."
3,Crinkle Cutter Works Great,"This is a great crinkle cutter for what I hoped to accomplish. While the groves aren't incredibly deep, the crinkle effect is detailed and visible, especially on softer vegetables, such as zucchini. I agree that it is a little harder to see and makes carrots look more jagged than crinkled. The handle is sturdy and the cutter is durable and easy to clean. I have noticed that I need to peel the zucchini first because the blade won't cut through without a lot of force if the skin is left on. The value for the price of this cutter is great!"
5,I love this album,"I had a cassette tape years ago of this album but it was out of here long ago. I searched on and off over the years for the CD but did not find it. It was serendipity that caused me to look this up on Amazon. I bought the MP3 download. It is still a great sound from the uptempo ""New and Different Way"", the bluesy ""Do You Want to Dance, the ballad ""Seeing You for the First Time"", or the jazz influenced ""Love is Here"". I guess my current fondness for Raul Malo's range of style has some roots in this CD."
1,awful,I absolutely hate it. I threw it away after I tried to fill it and use it. A spoon is less messy and easier to use.
3,Better for Maple Syrup!,"While I do keep honey in it, the opening at the base is a bit too small and it takes longer to let the honey drip out than it would take to drizzle maple syrup over pancakes. So, if you are patient enough it is perfect and you don't have a big honey mess to clean up everyday after you use a honey bear.~The Rebecca Review"
1,Cheesy handle for the price,"The handle and pump mechanism for this dispenser are cheesy plastic - they will not last at all. The previous reviewer also pointed out - correctly, that the honey drips out very slowly. Not worth the money. They should have used a metal handle and pump and charged a reasonable price for decent quality. Not worth your money."
3,good honey pot,Great after the honey warms up. This is my third one the plastic thumb release always breaks.
2,broken,"I was really looking foward to using the honey dispenser. However, when I opened the package, the dispenser was broken. Not because of the packing; it was well wrapped in bubble wrap, it looked in good condition but the dispenser lever was broken. Unable to use. Need to send it back. NOT Recommend."
5,Honey Dispenser,"I like this style of honey dispenser, rather than the ones with the dip stick. Only con is filling it, you have to plug the bottom while you fill. All in all great product."
1,Poor Quality - Don't Buy,This item is described as being glass and stainless steel. The description fails to mention that components are also brittle plastic. Don't waste your money on this poor quality product.
2,Disappointing when used,"I actually put this on my wish list, thinking that it was absolutely the most unique honey server I'd seen. When I received it as a gift, it was even cuter than pictured. However, when I filled it, and used it the first time, I was incredibly disappointed! The plunger that holds the honey in is lifted when you press the handle, but it doesn't lift far enough to let more than the tiniest trickle of honey come out. Took FOREVER to get enough honey on my piece of toast. It looks wonderful, but if you want to eat your toast before it gets cold, this is not going to work for you!"
2,Honey/syrup dispenser problems,"Neat idea, but baffling to see how to fill. Factory was no help. Finally figured it out - it's awkward but do-able.DO NOT TIP the dispenser after filling or in use.IF USING MAPLE SYRUP and you refrigerate it, any syrup left in the bottom opening after use will crystallize, restricting or blocking the opening on next use. Any crystals left around the stopper when you shut it off will make all the syrup drain out into the drip catcher."
4,Makes dispensing convenient!,"I use this as a condensed milk dispenser and love how clean/neat it makes everything. I actually have to stop myself from getting one for every syrup we use in my household... Golden, maple, honey, etc.I've had absolutely no trouble filling it, since I simply take a small piece of plastic wrap and make sure it's taut at the bottom. It's clean and easy, and takes me less than a minute to implement.All in all, I love how it's solved my issue with syrup sweeteners being too sticky/messy to use on an every day basis -- the only gripe I have is that I wish the lid was actual stainless steel, rather than plastic. :("
5,We love this little pot!,"We have had ours for about a year. I bought one as a gift, and she is buying one for someone else.It is much less messy than the honey bear. I like to buy honey by the gallon anyway, so it's perfect. When you are filling it, cover the opening at the bottom with your finger to keep it from leaking out. As you use up the honey it will flow slower, just keep it a third filled up and it will do just fine.Honey can cause the dispenser and its base to stick together. Just pay attention, otherwise the base may fall and break (as mine did). I just use a decorative coffee mug as a base now and it works just as well."
3,There are better Carmen McRae albums available.,"I first became aware of Carmen McRae in the 1950's; and over the years I have purchased a good number of her LP's and CD's. Like most artists who have put out a substantial number of recordings, some of hers are outstanding while others are less than stellar. This effort belongs in the latter category. The main difficulty I have with this production is her failure to connect emotionally with the musical theater classics she chose. Perhaps these songs were not the correct vehicles for her unique gifts. The bottom line: your music dollars can be put to better use elsewhere."
4,Attractive spoon,"I ordered this for a gift, perhaps to be used to serve nuts from a bowl. It was very nice and quite unique."
3,TOUGH HOSE,"YOU CAN SEE AND FEEL THAT THIS HOSE IS VERY DURABLE.ITS ALITTLE HEAVIER AND SHORTER FOR JOBS AROUND THE HOUSE,BUT I USE IT AS A SECOND HOSE TO BLOW SAWDUST AROUND.I ALSO USE IT OUTSIDE IN THE GARAGE TO FILL MY CAR TIRES.SO WHEN YOU DRAG THE HOSE AROUND ON CONCRETE IT WONT WEAR AWAY LIKE THE THINNER HOSES..GOOD PRICE TO HAVE AN EXTRA HOSE AROUND....."
1,Garbage,Spent 1hour changing fittings and Teflon tape to figure out both ends of hose leak right out of the box
2,over 2 1/2 years of use and I still HATE IT!,"I see all the good reviews on this hose, but my experience was not pleasant.I can only assume that mine was defective, with a built-in permanent twist.It was very aggravating because I cannot coil this hose up for storage or to hang it on the wall - regardless if it's under air pressure or not. All my previous air hoses did not have this problem. I can coil them up easily for transport or storage.I really like the bright orange color and the hose seems very tough. Rather than return or trash it, I cut it's length short and now I'm using it as a feeder hose from my compressor to an air hose cord reel.Again, maybe my hose was defective, so it might be a good idea for you to check and inspect yours upon delivery.Cheers, Jeff"
2,"too basic, too dated","Let me begin with the positive: this book does contain very basic information on basic cyclocross skills, such as dismounting and bunny hopping. However, this information is contained in about ten pages of the book. The rest is pretty useless, including info on who won the World Cyclocross Championships in the early 90s and info on outdated equipment (Spinergy Wheels, for example). Since the book is so outdated, the section on equipment is pretty useless. Equipment has changed drastically since this book was published. I recommend that you save your money and simply do an internet search to find pages demonstrating basic 'cross skills."
3,"Outdated, too general","Although revised into a second edition, the book is still very outdated. A lot of time is spent talking about equipment, which becomes outdated quickly, and you can tell the updates were edited in rather than rewriting the whole section. The space would be better spent talking about specifics of tactics and training. The pages devoted to embrocation really dates the book. Fortunately the section on training seem fairly current, given the recent advances in training science. Still, the updates put the book in the late 90s, so it's still a decade out of date. A good overview, but it leaves probably the biggest audience - road and mountain racers who've done a few 'cross races and become hooked - disappointed."
3,Its cool,"I love Sony. I think there inovators and leaders in the electronics industry. This product shows just that. Easy to use, attractive and a nice peice of equipment. Setting up was easy. The registration process was a little overboard. I dont think you should have to register a product just to use it. ""Big Brother"" But you gotta do what you gotta do. Nice features and decent software but the conversion time is way to long. Also whats up with them crappy [cheap] earbud head phones? When you spend[this much] you should at least get some rockin head phones to go along. In closing worth $400.00 no. Worth $200.00 yes. Bottom line."
2,Sony & MP3 & XP,"Great little walkman, however, its not a true MP3 player.It uses its own format similar to MP3, also you can forget downloading MP3's of the net. Idealy if you have the original CD then no problems, otherwise not so good.Also if you want it to run woth XP OS then you might have to send it back to sony for a firmware upgrade, dependant on the age.Happy MP3ing..........."
4,MPWhat?,"The Sony MemoryStick would and could become one of the best portable MP3 players on the market...if it weren't for the fact that it isn't an MP3 player!Technically, because Sony only allows its proprietary ATRAC music-compression system on its player, it isn't an MP3 player. Thus, any MP3's you might have already on your computer would need to be converted to the ATRAC compression system first. Unfortunately, this causes a lot of hassles, and if you already have a huge amount of MP3's (legally, of course) on your system, you might want to look at another of the player's out there.However, if you are looking to digitally manage all of your music on your computer, and you have a huge hard drive, then this is the best player on the market for you."
5,One of our favorite stories,"We like this book so much, we chose it as ""the"" book to give for Christmas this year. It is a tale of three trees, who each have a goal for life. Life doesn't go as planned, but in the end they each reach their goal in a way that only God could orchestrate."
2,Christian book,"I was unfamiliar with this traditional folktale, but drawn in by the enchanting cover. The Three Trees become religiously significant after being cut down. One becomes the cross upon which one's hands are nailed. I'll either return or donate this item."
5,tnvolsgirl,I love this book and so do my kids. I'm sure my grandkids will too. I was surprised at what excellent condition it was for a used book. Even the cover looked really good. Thanks much!
1,shabby at best,the book is very raggety and thuroughly written in which i didnt see explained anywhere in the listing information
2,"Kinda funny, no real suggestions","I picked this up at a real bookstore because the title looked interesting and I had a business trip and would be able to read this away from my boss.There's some humor to the classifications of different management styles, and some decent anecdotes, but the main take-away I got from this was ""work sucks, and you'd rather be doing something else.""I could've guessed this on my own."
2,HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT,Joe McIntyre has such an incredible voice ... that is the only reason this review got 2 stars. The songs themselves are a huge disappointment. The songs are very badly written and the lyrics often ramble without making a lot of sense. The only saving grace on this album would have to be Rain and Easier and they are still just ok.
2,Disappointed! Joe can do so much better!!,"I'm a huge Joe fan but this album [stinks].... Sorry Joe! I don't know what he was thinking when he made this CD. Stay the Same was so much better! I honestly think it's the influence of that guy he's working with now, Eman. I bought this Cd the day it came out and I have listened to it at the most 3 times since I bought it. I hate it! Joe should stick with pop! He has too much talent to be wasted in albums like this! Hope his next album is better but if he keeps doing this type of music is gonna [stink].... Vocally the album is great, he has a great voice but the songs [stink]!"
4,Joe has done it again!,"This is a fun and fresh cd. Joe's personality definitely shines through in this music! I am very disappointed at the less than welcome greeting that the first single 'Rain' received on the radio. I called to request it, but the local station didn't even have the cd! It is unfortunate because 'Rain' is a beautiful song and deserved to be played. It is obvious that Joe put his heart out for the world to see while writing for this album and I hope that the next single 'Easier' gets more airtime."
5,A Refreshing Change,"Meet Joe Mac is a refreshing change. Joey Mcintyre has an amazning voice and this cd allows him the opportunity to show us how much he has grown since New Kids as an artist and as a person. Joey is a wonderful entertainer and unlike some of the new artists of today he does an excellent job performing live, this guy can really sing. Meet Joe Mac has it all, beautiful slow songs and amazing upbeat songs. Joey really put his heart into this cd you can hear it in every song, he deserves some recognition for his wonderful talent. Go buy it today, you won't be disappointed.Fan for life, bobbiejo"
2,Poorly-made,"As others have noted the leaves are prone to falling out. The tabs are not sufficiently crimped - yes, I can do it myself but I shouldn't have to. Best to do this before you use it; the ring-leaves especially - or you'll be treated to a broccoli-waterfall when you pick it up. Clean it carefully (i.e. not roughly) or more leaves will be shed."
1,You get what you pay for....,Purchased this several months ago. I like the size and looks of it. But it is falling apart after 3-4 months. My prior one lasted at least 10-15 years. Thus if you want one to last pay the extra money. This one will last about 3-6months if you are lucky. The 'petals' ar just crimped in and start to fall off after 6-8 uses.
1,Poor design,"We had the smaller size of this steamer and it worked flawlessly for years. I passed it on to a relative because I needed a larger one. Since we were happy with the smaller one, we bought the same brand. Big mistake!!!! As others have mentioned, the petals fell off EVERY time we used it. This got old really quick and it soon was tossed out. I did find another brand for more money, but it works perfectly. Not once has a petal fallen off. I also like my new one because it has taller feet."
4,This cd is heavy!,"this is amazing,even better then the first one!If your into hip hop like me the best tracks are Blaqout with you don't really want some, da rockwilder by redman & method man also the party anthem fat man scoop with where ya at!this soundtrack is off the hook"
5,Guys please help me with song name...,"Hello, please help me. When black boy and white girl was on the dance floor (in the club) there was the song (first was MethodMan And Redman - Da Rockwilder ) and after that song there was second cool song. Please can anyone tell me artist and the song name of that song."
3,Good cd but missed a good song,"I liked the cd but It missed some songs like the one playing when they are in the club and Sarah gets mad because Derek is dancing with Nikki. ... . That's the only song I can think of that's not in the soundtrack. Over all it's a good cd with some slammin dance songs. It even has some slow songs that are really good like ""when it doesn't matter"" and ""I can tell."""
5,"3/8"" Air Hose",Good product. I purchased this item to work with a small air compressor. I have used it on a regular basis with no problem. Would purchase additional pieces if needed.
5,High Quality,This is worth the buy if you have an air compressor. It is high quality rubber and has a quality feel.
5,Great Hose,Replaced a vinyl or plastic hose with this rubber hose. Really glad I did! It is a real joy to work with. Lays flat and works very well. I strongly recommend it.
4,High quality hose for a great price,"I bought this hose as a secondary hose to use in the garage. Overall it works great, but personally I prefer my other hose. The reason is that the external material of the hose is very porous causing it to pickup a ton of dust and dirt. My other hose is a cheap hose from a local tool store (Northern Tool) and the external material is a bit less soft causing it to repel dirt rather than pick it up."
4,"A different approach to ""ride 'em Flicka""","I came across this book while looking to buy a Flicka sailboat...the type that Charles Dewell sailed from Ca to the South Pacific and Hawaii. I wanted a small, seaworthy, solo sailing vessel. Well, you can't get much smaller than a 20 footer!!! The book moved along a bit slowly for me, but I truely enjoyed the adventure. I don't think that I will be following in his footsteps across the Pacific any time soon...but I think I may just buy that Flicka because I have the confidence that it can get me through anything and get me anywhere I have the courage to go! Thanks, Charles, for an inspirational journey!!!"
3,Not bad,"It can be a good book for beginners...it is for sure. I did not expect anything as i knew already it would be presented like that.In general, you can find really necessary material there, so , good luck to the learners of French!!!;)))"
4,good beginner book and cd,"I have not had any formal Franch teaching and this book is giving me a real feel for the French language. I am very satisfied with it, especially the cd which helps in pronunciation."
5,Great transaction,Great book! This is the third copy I have purchased. I wore the other copies out re-reading them.
4,Thank the stars!,"This neat gadget allows you to use even MORE filters with your cokin filter system. Just think of it, now you can use a skylight, polarizer, 4 star filter, ND and more all at once! A great item to have in your photobag for those moments when you need more filters, but dont' have the room to put them in your filter holder."
5,Good Choice,"This converter works with many products and is easy to use, if you follow the instructions. I use it for a portable DVD player. Quality seems to be good."
3,review,"Helpful for getting inside the borderline personality disorder.This book is however, not for everyone and a bit pricy at that."
3,dbt manual,"this offers some good ideas and approaches but the writing is not clear and it is hard to understand some of the concepts, techniques, and some of the handouts. still, there is some useful stuff.if you were going to try to apply the whole program and run borderline dbt groups you would need this."
5,skills training manual for treating boderline personality disorde,I purchased a used book and it looks like new. It was in great shape. Again I'm very satisfied with my purchase thru amazon.com. Timely delivery. I'm very happy.
3,Simple little device.,I don't think I'm making my dough right - so blame me. Either way - it's a cute lil kitchen decor piece if you can't make tortillas!
4,New,product worked fine I just was not happy that it took over 10 days to recive the product the shiper did not ship right away thay wated almost 10 busness days be for shiping. But got paid with in 2 business days.
3,The cast iron one worked better.,"My wife and I are were not very impressed with this tortilla press. Compared to a plastic one that we originally had, this one is much better. Unfortunately, it would not press tortillas as thin as we wanted, and 6.5 inches was smaller than we thought it was going to be.We later switched to the 8 inch cast iron press that is also sold on amazon, which we have been much more satisfied with. The cast iron press will thin out our dough as thin was we want, even to the point of being too thin if we push it that hard. The size of the tortillas is much more convenient as well. If we want smaller tortillas, we just use less dough."
2,Not nearly large or easy enough,"I purchased this product because I am embarking on a gluten-free diet, and wanted to be able to make tortillas at home. This is an inexpensive press, but creates really small tortillas, to the point where the best use is probably small tostadas and quesadillas. Even as a press for taco shells, it is small. Also, I found that in order to get a uniform thickness (not skinny on one side and thick on the other) I had to rotate the dough several times after pressing in order to ensure the right thickness and uniformity, so the press didn't really make it much easier than hand-rolling the dough. If you're looking for something useful for burrito and enchilada type tortillas, I'd recommend going with a larger model."
4,tortilla press,I have used my new tortilla press a few times now. It makes you feel authentic to do it but probably can press a tortilla with just about anything heavy. The handle press is not very strong (feels like I will bend it when pressing hard) but it hasn't bent yet. I still like it and am happy with the purchase.
5,Nice jacket and a steal for the price,"I recently purchased both this jacket and the Brandon Thomas Twill Barnie jacket. While both are nice, I prefer this one. The main reason for this is that it fits WAY better than the other. I ordered a large in both, and the Twill Barnie jacket feels really big in the chest and waist, but it fits right in the sleeves. This jacket fits way more proportionally throughout. I ordered the navy color, and I have no complaints at all. Great deal."
2,Flannery O'Connor:A Good Man is Hard to Find,I needed a book of her short stories. I did not realize that this one only had one story and analysis of it. I then ordered a book of her short stories.
5,Does what it is supposed to,What can you really say about a prodcut like this and in this price range? It's either solid and exactly what you expect or a cheap piece of junk. This is solid and exactly what you expect. It's plastic but it's fine. It fit tight enough around my Rosewill media card reader and perfectly in my case. For the small change it costs I am very happy with it.
3,Works. Not great quality.,"This is what the description says, a 3.5"" to 5.25"" bay adapter. It does come with screws. Basic black plastic construction.Cons: Included screws are not correct pitch for normal drive screws. They worked fine on my 3.5"" multi card reader but on an actual drive they may strip or damage the threads.Overall I think $8.99 was a little steep but it was the cheapest I could find at the time."
4,girls talking girl talk,The magazine is for teen girls by teen girls. My daughter likes to read the letters section because she can relate to what girls are talking about. I think it helps her to realize that what ever it is she is feeling is normal.
1,"Deep southern sound, crisp lyrics,Raw beats (Dat New South)","This is a hot album, these guys will soon be heard across tha nation duddy ken and low down keep it hot. This album has a southern sound that only the south holds. The lyrics on the album are hot,and the beats are raw. My favorite tracks on the album are pecan season,shackles,ath reppin', crossfire, da club,and cranky up. The other songs are also growin on me. All my homeboys love the album when i let them hear it they burned it from me and they bump it in they chevys and cutlasses so u know its hot. Im looking forward to hearing something else from em'."
3,Michael Franks in an 80s Mood,"I'm a big fan of Michael Franks but don't enjoy this album to the same degree as I do his earlier work, due to the presence of drum machines, sound effects, etc that give it a distinctly 80s sound. I lean towards his more jazz-oriented albums like ""Art of Tea"" and ""Sleeping Gypsy"". But at the same time, most of the ""Skin Dive"" tracks are great tunes, highly listenable and danceable. ""When She Is Mine"" is a beautiful song, arranged in a classic jazz vein, that is easily among Franks' greatest compositions. You also might consider buying ""Passionfruit"" which is a somewhat similar album with great songwriting and still more on the jazz/pop side of things. But if you are a big Michael Franks fan, ""Skin Dive"" is worth buying."
3,Good for Concierge Employment but not starting a business,Good for Concierge Employment but not starting a business. It does not really help you if you are starting a Concierge business. I thought this book was a guide to help you get started in the Concierge Business so I was very disappointed when I found no use for this book when reading it.
5,To be a professional concierge... a rewarding career!,"Our customers trust us to provide a wide array of support. We manage daily errands and complete personal or work related projects. With our assistance, our client's productivity at work improves and they gain time to spend with family and friends. Being a personal assistant/concierge is a rewarding career. I work for Simply Imperial (Maine's only real personal assistant and concierge company) and I can tell you that being a personal assistant is a fantastic, rewarding career!"
1,Horrible.,"I decided to listen to this CD because I absolutely adore Tori Amos, and quite like P.J. Harvey and Bjork. They're all excellent artists, and I was hoping that this CD would retain a little of their original magic. That, or recreate the songs in a new and interesting way.Well, the 'singer' on this album definately recreated the songs. However, she's also butchered them to a point where they sound unrecognizable, and just plain terrible. The vocalist sounds like she's about four years old, and the songs themselves are bathed in horrible techno and synthesizers. Just listen to 'Human Behaviour' and you'll see exactly what I mean.The only semi-decent track on this album is her cover of 'Baker, Baker', but even that pales in comparison to the original.Words cannot express how terrible this CD is."
5,another good one by brown...,what i liked about this one (taped version) was that it was so different from her other books . . . but maybe that's why i like author; her books are always different . . . there was an excellent narration by stephen lang.
1,Not one of her best...,"I've read all Sandra Brown's books since the begining and this was not one of her best. It might have been a good mystery but, let's face it, most woman buy Brown for her sizzling, sexy romances. The main characters didn't really meet until almost mid-way in the book and where was the sizzle -- the passion? The heroine was not very interesting and there was virtually no chemistry between them. I would not put this book on the same plain as MIRROR IMAGE, SLOW HEAT IN HEAVEN, or even some of her early series romances. FAT TUESDAY was pretty slim pickens."
2,"Unoriginal, unimaginative disappointment","Generic characters, cliched writing, make this hard to get through. No excitement felt by this reader--no interest in stereotype hero and villain, and the heroine (if one can call her that) is unbelievably shallow and boring. New Orleans also comes across as flat and boring. This story could have taken place in Dallas, LA, or Minnewanka for all the sense of place present. Read if you don't mind plodding through page after page of slow-moving story as you hope for something exciting to happen."
3,"A concentration on more action, less relationship","Sandra Brown is a fabulous storyteller and Fat Tuesday is very well written.However, I felt as if the plot concentrated so much more on Burke Basile and Pinkie Duval. And the point of view was basically limited to these characters. Most of the information the reader learns about the heroine is through another character's eyes and thoughts. As a matter of fact, if I remember correctly, the point of view NEVER even enters into the mind of Remy. Big mistake--how can the reader sympathize and like this woman if we don't even know what goes on in her mind?Sandra Brown's fictional, larger novels are my favorite because they have a mix of danger and romance. Unfortunately, Fat Tuesday only serves up danger."
4,A definate page turner. Couldn't put it down.,I have read alot of Sandra's books..it was different then most but I enjoyed it.I guess it depends on the reader ..if you can relate somehow to the charactors..its a feel good book. One of my favs was Eloquent Silence.
2,Fat Tuesday,"Sandra Brown is always a must read, and while this book was a good read, it wasn't my favorite book of hers. The mystery/suspense was well written, but the connection between Remy and Burke just doesn't work. I never felt the chemistry and emotional intensity that is so important."
5,helping me understand how a car operates,"I changed jobs and became a parts delivery person. The knowledge I have received from the book as helped me in knowing what my customers are talking about and thus can relate messages to the sales staff. For my job and personally, I like knowing what the function of the parts are and where they are located. I am so glad to have the book. It was well written and made learning easy."
1,This book is useless,"I was planning to perform all the maintenance work on my 2 cars, an Audi S4 and a Honda CR-V. I have done oil changes and air filter changes in the past but I wanted to do more. I bought this book and the ""Auto Repairs for Dummies"" book in addition to the specific service manuals for the 2 cars. This book gives very very brief explanations with big text fonts and big pictures (not much meat) of how things work so don't hope to perform any actual work by following the book. If you just want to know how cars work and don't wish to perform any actual work then this book may be is for you. I highly recommend the dummy book and forget about this book if you do plan to perform work on your car. The dummy book has a lot more details and it actually shows you how to do the work. I often turned to the dummy book when the service manuals are not explaining things in detail."
4,Interesting,I read Rick McKinley's other book titled This Beautiful Mess which left me a little dissapointed. When I read this book I was quite pleased and didn't want to put it down. This is an excellent read I believe and could also be used to encourage or self help others especially for the average Joe. Loved it.
5,Typical George Benson,What can I say... just another well performed and exceptionally produced album by George Benson. The remake of Beyond the sea is outstanding in my opinion. The sound quality of this CD is very good!
1,A Book With No Substance.,"Sometimes I enjoy reading trash. I read the two reader reviews and decided to purchase this book as they were both positive reviews. After reading it - I realized I had read basically NOTHING. I can only guess the writer was badly in need of money to write this. If she did indeed care for Bogart, and there was an affair (which I'm not convinced of after reading this fluff), then why would she want to hurt his still living wife and children, knowing it would be something he would never have wanted, would have in fact been deeply hurt by? My copy is going into the garbage where it belongs. I like at least a little fact and substance when I'm reading trash."
2,Bogie and Me,"Haven't read it. I just was looking at the reviews of this book because my husband and I met the author in a bar in New Orleans one afternoon in June, 2006. We frequent Touche's on Royal Street,when we are there. Donna the bar ""hostess extraordinaire"" serves her usual local characters and there is always a couple of locals you can just sit back and listen to while queching your thirst on a hot and humid New Orleans afternoon. Ms. Thompson was sitting at the bar that Saturday afternoon, dressed the part too, hat and all. It was a show to watch and a story to hear. I was struck how sad it is that she is now alone with her memories and has only the past to keep her company. However, I think she does get a kick out of seeing peoples reaction when the find out who she is and she begins to banter about her life with a Hollywood Icon."
3,better late than never... not always!,Well it finally arrived... after Christmas. It was a little disappointing that it took so long. Had to buy another gift at the last minute to cover for the tardy one.
5,A canning necessity.,"Nice stainless funnel. It looks nicer than I expected and the only reason I ordered it instead of going to the store because it was part of a suggested threesome on the website. Not at all sorry, saved me from going to the store because I probably would have forgotten it otherwise."
5,Great funnel!,Just received this funnel and really like it! We're using it for more than canning. The top is a larger diameter than a typical canning funnel- larger is better! - and the diameter of the funnel that sets into the jar is the size of a regular mouth canning jar. Yes it's a bit tight in older canning jars that have extra thick glass but you could set it inside a plastic funnel if you're worried about spillage. I like the idea of using stainless steel for hot liquids.
5,stainless steel funnel,"This is a useful utensil to own when you need to pour sourdough mix, applesauce, soups etc. in a quart jar for storage. The stainless steel is heat resistant and should last a lifetime."
1,What a fiasco,"I subscribed to this magazine a year ago and never received anything. Customer Service directed my complaint to the Magazine Department, which in turn put me in a loop to the same Customer Service page. I guess this means that a refund is out of the question..."
3,You just can't like him,"The hero of this story, and I use that term lightly, is not a likeable character. He's whiney, selfish, arrogant and absorbed by his own sexual needs. This does little to distract from an interesting story about a powerful singer of water and the manner in which the other bards band together to repair their fractured community. It is fine continuation of the four quarters series and most readers should enjoy it. Just don't expect to like or identify with the main character much."
3,Creative... with a severly flawed charachter!,"This book was kind of a let down after the last three books of the series, but it made up for it in drawing up a whole new civilization where your imaginaiton could run wild. Although the plot was carefully thought out, I found the main character to be distinctly childish and continually stuck in a rut of ""Oh, woe is me! "" This drove me insane. Luckily, but the end of the book, he grew up, as all characters should, leaving me with a bubbling curiosity as to ""what happens next?"". Despite the boring parts and a character who whines through the whole ordeal (not to mention controlled completely by his sexual needs) I enjoyed the twists the author used to spice up the plot. Still, I hope the next one will make up for the deficiencies of ""the quartered sea""."
5,Christmas,I bought this for my brother for Christmas. We had been looking for it for a while. I was so excited to watch him open it.
3,Hawkwind - 'Master of The Universe' (Delta),"Give us a break. Isn't there NOW like four different Hawkwind compilation CD's by the same name, 'Master Of The Universe'? This fifteen track collection looks to be tunes pulled from the long out-of-print Hawkwind import releases 'Acid Daze', Volumes 1, 2 and 3. Are there REALLY that many completists out there? I'm assuming there is."
3,Buyer Beware,"Great quality scoop, however....this is not a 3 TBS. scoop it actually only holds 2 TBS. Other reviews I read stated that it was listed as a 2 TBS. scoop, but held 3 TBS, so I ordered it as I needed a 3 TBS scoop. As soon as I opened the package I checked the measurement and even though Amazon's description now reads 3 TBS. and Norpro's packaging reads 3 TBS, it definitely is not. So, if you are looking for a high quality, 2 TBS scoop, this is a great choice."
3,Sticky Operation,The scoop has a nice hefty feel and the finish is good but the operation of the lever is poor. It seems to stick making it difficult to release the dough.
4,Stay Tight Forever,These are my boys from home and their doing the damn thing. If you don't have it go and cop it 1.
5,Most prized of all black teas,"Certainly my favourite tea, this has not only a got a magnificent tart 'muscatel' taste' a thin-bodied tea, beautifully spiced and with a lovely floral aroma and golden hue.It is highly relaxing and soothing, giving you just the right buzz for the day.And also perfect for all occasions for relaxing at a coffee shop, reading, watching a movie certainly, but also for a highly charged work day.It is certainly no wonder this one is regarded as the highest quality and most prized of all black teas."
5,Looked everywhere for this!!,We have breakfast at Cracker Barrel about once a month and I always get hot tea as I am not a fan of their coffee and this is the type they serve. I had looked everywhere in town for the darjeeling and noone carried it! Was so happy when I found it on Amazon--this is the best tea!!
3,Chris Isaak Silvertone,Only Chris Isaak music that is mediocre. Love every other CD but this one. Excellent musician nonetheless. Suggest ANY of his other CDs.
5,All-Time Classic!,I guess one of the main reasons you're reading the reviews is to try and gauge whether or not to buy the album so I'll try make this as brief as possible. THIS IS ONE OF THE GREATEST ALBUMS EVER MADE. Los Lobos cover many different styles with total excellence. The opener Don't Worry Baby is still probably my favourite Los Lobos track but the rest of the songs are magnificent and brilliantly played. Take the opening to Evangeline and the sax solo on the fantastic I Got Loaded - just great music. Buy this you will never regret it.
5,Recommended by my dentist,My dentist recommended this---and he was right. Works great and the price was right---funny how things on line can be cheaper the local stores!!
2,In the Flesh,"The acting in this wasn't very good, the only thing really going for it is the box art. While the actors may be easy on the eyes and the story had some potential, this movie just didn't pull it together."
1,Bad but good,"Other reviewers summed up the plot, hustler rides with a trick to a atm, trick goes out to withdraw money, man comes along and stabs the man to death. Hustler drives tricks car away, and leaves car, and fingerprints for the police to trace. Now the hustler is a suspect. Now why didn't he report it??? Because he didn't want the police to know he was a hustler, and providing drugs to his chemically dependant strung out sister. He eventually falls in love with an undercover cop, and they go off into the sunset together, after a few interesting moments. The cop (corbin) has these eyes, that widen like he is in a hypnotic trance. Lots of scenes of men in a gay bar, and the ones hanging on the streets, look like they are all on queludes. This movie is awful, but at the same time, not too bad."
5,WOW!,"I gotta disagree with the idea that viewers might find this film only fair. *I* found it to be VASTLY superior to most other ""real"" movies produced for the GLBT audience.It was well written, cinematographically excellent and the performances of Dane Ritter and Ed Corbin were both human and honest, without resorting to sensationalist sex/nudity. And THAT, to me, is what great film-making is all about!The story kept me going through the whole movie."
4,I LIKED IT,"I LIKED IT ENOUGH TO BUY IT. NOT AN ANG LEE, BUT REALLY EARNEST AND HONEST. AND I LIKE THE ENDING BETTER!!!! MOVIE QUEENS MAY PAN IT BUT I SAY, GET IT AND MAKE UP YOUR OWN MIND."
5,Another Great Season from Nikita,"Non-stop action continues with twists and turns that I did not expect. Edgy and vibrant Nikita is a character that, I think, a lot of people can relate too. Peta Wilson and Roy Dupuis are remarkable as the leads but make no mistake, the supporting cast is exquisite as well. Highly recommend this to everyone."
5,One of the Best Series EVER,"I faitfully watch Nikita when I was in high school and when I went to college, I schedule my studies around Nikita. I made sure regardless what I was doing, I made it home to watch it. Peta and her supporting cast are awesome and I don't know why the series got cancel but I do know that I can't wait for this season to come and the rest of the seasons. I caught a case of the a$$ last year when WB change the release date on season 2, hope it doesn't happen with this one. But for those that like Alais, you'll love Nikita. I have a friend hook on it because she loves Alais and didn't think she would like it but changed her mind after the 1st season. So give it a try"
2,lousy packaging,"Not the seller's fault - the package was poorly designed. The discs are in plastic holders, glued to the cover with cheap glue. Open the package without thinking and the holders fall out."
4,80s electronic funk with a twist,"This album whilst never a huge chart buster offered a template for much of the sounds we take for granted today. Each track offers something different,dance funk, romantic feel good, and even social statement. Great up loud and memorable, it's tracks will come back to you at strange times triggered by who knows what and you will drag this cd out of a box and play it to death again. Great reminder when music was changing, with so many influences colliding at the one time and this cd is a musicial compilation of the times when it was created. You'll love it and cry like Aretha too."
4,Chilling -- good read,"I saw this story on 'I shouldn't be alive' and was riveted. How did anyone survive? Author is an amazing person, the book is really good."
3,Not good for beginners,"The book is complete and correct, no argument there. However, I had a lot of trouble learning from it. I had to re-read the same paragraph a number of times in order to derive comprehensive meaning from the author's scant explanations. The author usually walks through a sample problem, but then provides little or no guidance for solving an arbitrary problem of the same type. Likewise, although the book centers on induction, it was extremely difficult to follow with no prior induction education.The author often presents the answer to some given problem with words like ""obviously"" or ""clearly"" without making things at all clear or obvious to the student. I kept wishing that the author wouldn't be so tight-lipped and would spend some extra time clarifying the issues at hand."
5,Best solution for storing/using long extension cord!,"I searched for a solution to easily store and use (wind/unwind) my 100' 12g all weather extension cord. The other reviews are dead on, although this one is more expensive than the Home Depot options ($10-$15), it works perfectly. I was able to wind up my 100' cord with no effort in a seconds. It made using my new snowblower easy."
5,"So simple, yet so great!","The concept behind this cord winder is so simple, yet the results are so great. Easy to use and durable. I have a 100' 12/3 gauge winter cord on the winder that I use with my electric snowblower and it works like a charm. 100' out and 100' in seconds. Stays put when you pull and with a foot on the base the cord easily winds. Yes, it costs more than the orange cord wraps you see everywhere, but I wouldn't think twice!"
5,Fast and easy.,Works well and is really easy and fast compared to the traditional press. This a good product for the price.
5,spaetzle maker,A friend from Germany showed me how to make spaetzle with almost identical product.Easy to Clean and fun to use
5,love it!!!!!!!!!!,"don't use it all the time, but I think when winter comes and we eat a lot of soup, this will be great. can't wait first time I made spaetzles I use a too small of a pan. made a mess,but it was fun. will use again and again."
3,$6.99 is the cheapest price,I have been using a potato ricer but I recently watched an episode of Sara's Secrets where she adjusted her cookbook recipe for spaetzle with more water and used a spaetzle maker. It was totally different from using a ricer.Hand wash onlyMade in China
5,Spaetzle Making Machine!,"I have made Spaetzles about a dozen times using this and I couldn't imagine making them without it. It is quick and easy to use, and makes perfect sized Spaetzles. If you wash it shortly after using it, it is easy to clean. It appears to be dishwasher safe since I've put in through at least a dozen times with no ill consequences. Very happy with my purchase and highly recommend this product to others."
3,very generic,This group played at my high school. Nobody was impressed. They were trying to be like every other group in their genre.
4,perfect size for cookie dough balls,"great scoop that we mainly use when making cookies, it is the prefect size for cookie dough. The larger and smaller sizes (3 T and 1/2) make too big and too small balls for baking cookies"
2,Same as two other albums?,"I believe the recordings here are the same as the ones on ""Small Town Blues"" as well as ""Electric Flag [Live]."" I give this one points just because the cover is more late sixties than the others. Bad recordings of subpar performances. ""A Long Time Comin'"" is a great album of it's time. Check it out!"
2,"""He says"" too much.","I own two leopard tortoises, and I ordered the book because there isn't much literature out there. But the amount of information in this expensive book did not justify the price. There is far too much useless trivia, like the section on the climatic changes in Africa through the past few aeons, the parallel evolution of star tortoises, or living with tortoises and dogs. Both authors have written wonderful books, but this is not one of them. One particularly annoying thing: The amount of time R Paull spends talking about insignificant filler leaves his co-author next to no room in the book. Palika's knowledge and authority deserved more of a forum."
3,I just like Catch me I'm falling and Send me an Angel...,That was worth 5 bucks...I didn't have an iPod at the time!!
2,Not A Good Decision,"Using the term DTS to search for concert DVD's I foolishly bought this item thinking it was a combo CD/DVD(see Flaming Lips).Starting with the two first cuts I quickly realized that this was not one of my better purchases -""magic"" was a major disappointmment as were most of the up-tempo songs.If you listen to the ELO or Boz Scaggs DVD's you will here songs arranged as they were originally recorded. Her material is not that musically intricate so one wonders why little attempt was made to do the same. The sound quality is iffy at best - there is an annoying sax on some songs which does not belong. Technically the overall mix is poor and not worth the purchase price.I played a Remastered Bob Dylan CD(""OH Mercy"") after listening to ONJ and found the sound significantly better.There are remastered recordings of her songs available- one CD will be released on July 12th- and perhaps that's the way to go if you want original recordings properly remastered."
2,it sucked,the cast was weak. and so was the acting. the plot was unoringal. it was hard to make you want to love the characters.
1,Extremely disappointed,"Unless I somehow received a fluke shipment I can only express my extreme disappointment with these tea bags.After letting the tea bag steep for the suggested five minutes I was left with a cup of hot tea-colored waterwith almost no taste to speak of. The name ""Twinings"" may conjure up quality tea for most, but for me it is no reality."
5,Very Happy,This specific tea is getting very difficult to find in my smaller market area so I was thrilled to discover it on Amazon. The product arrived in great shape and very quickly. Thanks!
2,Clintons true colors?,"Did you believe the lie? Forty three percent of the voting public did. Love Bill Clinton or dislike the man this shows his true colors. James Carville and George Stephanopoulos honestly believed this Governor of Arkansas was going to change the world. He did, and it's a fascinating debate as to how good or bad it turned out!"
4,Great campaign!,"This DVD was amazing! I loved the insight into the Carville & Stephanopolous team. They truly reinvented how campaigns are operated. The documentary is well assembled, and quite complete."
4,Christmas cooking,Williams Sonoma's recipes have gotten better and this small book has enough great recipes to get one through the frenetic holidays with less stress and great dinners
4,12 O'Clock High Goes Burmese,"The Purple Plain is a winner, a handsomely mounted WW2 drama set in Burma where the Japanese are never seen: the enemy is the hostile landscape and the memories that cripple its hero. Gregory Peck's damaged pilot is still suffering from a bad case of 12 O'Clock High after the death of his wife in an air raid on their wedding night until he falls for Burmese girl Win Min Tan. (This being 1954, they may share an inter-racial romance, but they never actually kiss.) Naturally, as soon as he rediscovers a reason for living he's shot down behind enemy lines and has to make it back with not one but two crippled comrades. It's not much of a plot, true, but it's handled extremely well thanks to Robert Parrish's direction, which is surprisingly strong, direct and imaginative when called for, but still knows when to be unobtrusive as well. Great last shot too."
4,"gets hot, but works!","There are two ways to use this utensil... plunge into deep fat, or cook one side at a time. If you do one side at a time, you actually have to fry one side, take hold of the cool side of the tortilla, and flip it over and fry the other side because of the configuration of the handle, you can't just turn the thing over. You have to flip the tortilla itself. Still a timesaver if you're used to molding them in the pan with regular tongs. I do wear a leather work glove on the hand I'm holding it with, though. It gets quite warm."
3,Cooks ONE side,"Cooks one side of the taco shell. You will have to take the tortilla out and flip it so that you can cook the other half. The placement of the handle is in the wrong place. It's a great idea, this one just needs to be modified a little bit."
1,Total junk,I would not waste my money on this item. It is flimsy and just is not worth having. I do better using 2 forks
1,Waste of money,"The taco press was just a waste of money! It is awkward to hold while frying and I ended up having to use a lot more oil than when I just use tongs frying my tortilla shells because I can use a frying pan and not a huge deep pot. Will not use again, this is going to Goodwill."
1,broken,This was broken when I received it. One of the ends had broken off the handle. I had my husband weld it back together and it works fine now. Just acward to use because of the shape of the handles. Its a good idea jus not there yet.
5,Best Book I've read in a very long time!,"This book was recommended to me by my spiritual guide and I loved it. My husband died almost two years ago, and there are times when I wonder what it is I'm to do with my life. This book did not have the answer but validated the question. After finishing the book, I immediately gave my copy to a friend struggling through a second round of cancer and bought myself a another copy. This is great reading for anyone seeking a deeper spiritual meaning to their lives but especially for anyone who is working through a question in life."
1,Poor recptn or 2 much intrfernc,"(-)You have to be moving the head or changing the place or position all the time to get rid of the hiss and background high frequency noise; it does not matter how far or close you are frm the transmitter or what channel you select or turn on the Noise filter feature. People frm Radioshack explained to me, when I was returning it, that 900MHz home telephones could cause that kind of interference but my one is 2.4GHz. It's also VERY hard to find and control the volume.(+) they are very light and comfortable, and when the reception is good the music quality is wonderful."
2,Disappointed with Sony,"Sony is my favorite electronics manufacturer. We owned a similar pair of headphones (2 years ago) and they recently went bad. I assumed it was due to them being dropped. So I decided to buy what looked like the same quality earphones from Sony. They are VERY disappointing. They produce static at any range. The range is very short, and they create loud popping noises as you walk around. Come on Sony... listen to your customers and quit putting out trash. We have come to expect more from you."
2,Did not work for me....,"The headphones feel good and are not tiresome to wear, they sound great and have some nice design features such as the auto on/off switch.I purchased the headset to listen to streaming music from my computer as I wandered about the apartment. I soon found this to be impossible due to the interference, static or white noise that popped in and out with loss of the signal. In an adjacent room moving my head a couple inches from a clear spot took the signal out and replaced it with the noise.After reading several reviews of other sets I am beginning to believe it is the 900Mhz concept itself and the considerable amount of trash at that frequency in an urban setting... I may try a set at the new 2.4Ghz frequency because my 2.4Ghz telephone signal is solid and noiseless. Sorry, I really wanted this to work and maybe it will work for you at a better location.Ken"
3,Hiss,"Yes, hiss. That's what you get with this model. If you only plan on listening to same level music at a fairly low volume, then this is an O.K. unit. If you like a wide range of sound and volume levels then this is not the unit for you. I've used a Recoton w500 before and liked the variable tuning dials on both the headset and base. With the w500 set-up you have an infinite number of settings (912.5 - 914.5 Mhz) so that you can tune it for specific areas in the house. (They show up on Ebay now and then but don't drop them. I dropped mine 3 times and it quit working and they don't make them now.) With just three settings on the Sony model, your tuning capabilities are limited. I tried everything to get the best sound but there was always a little to a lot of background hiss except at very low volume. The high end was also crackly and artificial sounding. I know Sony can do better and there ARE units capable of excellent sound without the background noise. These aren't them."
2,"Good idea, poor implementation","The multichannel headphones are a good idea. But the transmitter/receiver are so underpowered, that even at 5 feet, simply changing the position of your head can cause the signal to disappear."
3,Very sturdy,The stainless steel design is durable and rugged. Nicely constructed. It worked fine on just the one chicken I've roasted. I don't think it is superior over other methods to roast chicken but I will use it from time to time. Roasting a chicken breast side down in a dish is also a very good way. The tray container though is great for catching the juices which can be used to make a very good sauce. It was fairly inexpensive which is a big reason I got it. It is definitely worth the price Amazon charged.
3,Purple Rain...NOT!,"This is the album that separates the Prince fans from the Purple Rain fans.An audatious move for Prince,to follow up a blockbuster like Purple Rain with an ambitious,yet wildly uneven piece of work.It has it moments like Raspberry Beret,Pop Life& Paisley Park,the rest is semi-memorable.The only reason Tamborine sticks to the brain it,s because its so annoying. This album is a prime example of an artist following their muse,and not be dictated by industry second guessing.Most simply run the formula into the ground,or just give up artistcally.It may not be Princes finest LP,but it's his boldest statement"
5,Young reader from Chicago,"This book is wonderful. I could never imagine a book so beautiful. I have been using this book with my family and I really appreciate it. The book tells the story of the events leading up to Christs birth, his birth, and the events after his birth. I am really glad that the author decided to include the events after his birth because otherwise so many special events would have been left out. This is the perfect book for children everywhere to learn about Jesus' birth."
2,ok of a product,"You have the taste of cinnamon,,but you have to use a lot,,you will go through the product fast,,not worth the money,,use regular cinnamon"
1,Stopped working after 5 months,When I first bought this product I was happy with it. I used it about 4 times then forgot about it. When I went to use it again 4 months later the cd player did not work at all. I called the company and they offered to fix it for $15 more or I could buy a new one (didn't even offer me a discount). I said no thanks. The technician I spoke to even said that there were some models out there with a defect in them and they supposedly got them all. I do not reccommend this cd player at all. I would've given this CD player NO STARS but that was not an option.
3,A well paced engaging read.,"Not a red-hot page turner, but interesting. The story is typical Fantasy fair; Good vs Evil. The Sleepstealers Minions and human traitors against the fractious and unsuspecting forces of Good. Like most such books the Hero (Rudy) has destiny thrust upon him and reluctantly accepts his role. With the help of, a dwarf, a fariy, his Niece, and an amiable Snow Lion, Rudy sets off on a mission of revenge that turns into nothing less than saving the world from the God of Evil. While not in the same league as Jordan or Fiest Mr. Niles writes a tight book that has me looking for the sequel."
3,"Engaging, but no new ground broken","This is a good read for those nights where you don't have anything special planned. The book is well written, and it keeps your attention quite well, although the story itself holds no new twists. The story of the Rudy and his companions is interesting and contains quite a number of trials and tribulations, but I found it a little hard to sympathise with him like I could with L.E. Modesitt Jr.'s Lerris for example. All in all, it's a pretty decent book though."
2,Not what I expected,"I loved the diary of Ann Frank, but this book pales in comparison. I found my mind wondering while reading it. I found it painful to even finish. In my opinion, the author should work on her writing style, keep the reader interested."
2,You'll be running for the guillotine after hearing this,"I know I can't be the only person sick of these [awful] tribute albums. Where would dwell records be without tribute albums? Deceased, The Chasm, Ritual Carnage and From The Depths raise the Flag Of Hate. As for the other 9 performers, well, I was left with only an Endless Pain inside my skull. Someone please let me know when a tribute album is released that is more good than bad. And the Worst Guitar Sound Award goes to Diabolic. I guess these guys opted to save a few bucks by recording in someone's basement using a tape recorder...."
2,book review,"This book was a little too violent for my taste. The romance between the vampire and heroine was o.k., but I really did not like all the graphic details of experiments being done. I will not purchase any more in this series."
5,Everyone Needs to Peek in Einstein's Refrigerator!!,"Everyone needs to peek in Einstein's Refrigerator. It is frivolous, fantastic, freaky and fun. The short accounts of bizarre but true tales are educational and entertaining. From stories so gross that you can't help gagging - to tales so silly that you will laugh aloud - people will want to know what you are reading. AND YOU will WANT to tell them! These weird details are too crazy to keep to yourself!There are so many fun facts that are just too peculiar to be true and absolutely amazing that they are! It is easy to become addicted! It is a fabulous collection of absolutely nothing yet it is all superfluously important! You never know what you will find in Einstein's Refrigerator!"
4,"If you know about oddities and curious facts already, this book'll surprise you!","I grabbed this book on a whim -- and who can resist the title anyway? I decided to relax on a Saturday afternoon with some light reading and the stories in this book were funny, interesting and made me want to read more. I loved books like Ripley's Believe it or Not, The Book of World Records and Mad Magazine and ""Einstein's Refrigerator"" falls somewhere in this illustrious genre. I thought I would get a rehash of tired old stories, but not so! I learned something new from the stories in this collection.Steve Silverman tells a story with a straight forward, easy-to-read style and some funny parenthetical remarks thrown in for good measure. Highly recommended for the curious kid in everyone!"
3,Good bathroom reading,"This book is a series of pleasant little surprises in an easy to read style. Unfortunately, the conversational style doesn't really translate to the written page, and some of the stories, such as how Heddy Lamar invented spread spectrum communications, are pretty well known. Because of this, I recommend reading it, but only ""while otherwise occupied."""
4,useless but fun,This book may be full of useless information but it was one of the best books i ever read. this was an easy book to read. not to wordy and not to easy. i enjoyed this book more each time i read a new chapter. you would be amazed on what type of information you will learn after reading this book.
5,This book is not for everyone...Thank God,"If your idea of a good season is to just ride, or be pack fill until the hills then don't waste your money. On the otherhand, if you can set goals, want results and need to raise your performance year over year then get this book. You have to read, understand and follow the content of this book closely. If you can, then you will be able to set up a year 'round training program which will provide the results you have been looking for. This book is technical. You will have to focus as with any effective performance program. No, you really don't need the expensive testing stuff. You can get the same test information with a cheap wind trainer or the recommended time trial tests. A bike, a good heart rate monitor, this book and a true desire to get faster (in this order)is all you need."
4,Short but Sweet,"A practical approach to managing training time for the cyclist who ""has been training and racing for some time"". A good implementation of periodization (including annual plan) emphasizing importance of recovery. Cyclists wishing to optimize workouts and improve performace will benefit from this book, however this highly structured optimization will cut back on the fun group rides and spinning sessions; Friel's Training Commandment 5 is ""Train with Groups Infrequently"". For more technical background see ""The Bicycle Racing Guide"" by Van der Plas and for the less experienced cyclist see ""Richard's Cycling for Fitness"" by Schubert."
5,A must-have for all serious cyclists.,"Buy it and use it. You'll get much faster. Also try paleo for a healthy active life. Thanks, Joe Friel."
3,good warmer /bad wax,"Just finished using GIGI cream wax. The warmer and the applicators are good. The wax is nothing but paint mixed with some glue. The wax is so bad and so sticky. Even after taking shower it doesn't go off the skin. Didn't use any of the other lotions that came with this. Probably they are another set of junk since we already have body lotions. I was about to put ""all purpose cleaner"" on my hands and read the instructions that it was only for Floor or Gigi warmer cleaning. The product would have worth with a better wax. And at the end, I noticed the wax container slightly got split at the bottom and leaked into the warmer - not a lot but a little.If you get a good warmer anywhere then this product is not worth even to put 50 bucks."
4,Good product,I like it but a little messy. Perfect for face but not bikini. Comes with creams also. Great product. Lana
3,eh...so so,"The heater and the strips is excellent, the wax isn't. I got the one for sensitive skin. I had every intention to put this to use and get my money worth out of it. However when I used it the wax was way too sticky and unmanageable. I still have issues doing eyebrows with it. I tried doing the bikini area once with it and I won't try it again with this wax. I did got to school for cosmetology so I do have a clue to what I am doing."
4,Easy to use but comes with bad strips,"It is very convenient to not have to warm this up in the microwave every few minutes. I do not like the strips that come with it, but it is easy to find more. Results are great once you get the hang of it."
4,Gigi mini pro waxing kit,I work for a salon and purchased this after kit after we had purchased one for the salon. It was cheaper here than with our salon discount at a salon supply distributor. I love this product and it's great for my at home waxing. Comes with directions.
1,not happy,I overall like the machine but the wax that came with the machine I am not happy with it is not like the one they use in the salons its thick and doesnt seem to grab the hairs and a lot remains on the skin after you pull it. I am contemplating returning the machine after several tries or maybe I will try different wax. The strips also that come with it are not the best because when you put it on the wax seeps through the strip and gets all over your hands. I have to say I am a bit frustrated with it.
1,NOT PLEASED WITH RESULTS,I like official WAX much better. This stuff was really runny and didn't do as good a job as regular wax. Wouldn't recommend. Sally Hanson wax worked much better for me. I have coarse hair.
2,not as ordered,Product was not as ordered. It was advertised as brazillian wax kit. It was a general kit for all types of waxing. I was disappointed and would not recommend for brazillian.
2,Useless,"This product comes with a wide variety of items but, not with the items you need. Instructions on how to use the machine would have been nice, they assume you know what you're doing. The creme wax is VERY sticky, so sticky that it glued the container shut. Also, they make refrences to products you need that they don't include such as powder. I never got to use this product because it was broken but, I didn't get a good impression."
3,Out of date material,All the steps have to be run on Axis 1.3 and eclipse 3.0 to make this book useful. Most of the steps won't work on Axis2 and eslipse 3.2. The readers need to have good knowledge on Axis2 to make the steps work.
1,Works great for one year!,"I bought this product two years ago. It worked great the first year and kept the fish alive. The second year it shorted out the outlet cutting the power off which I didn't catch until it was too late. I thought at first it was the outdoor lighting around the pond, but a week ago I took the lights out and put only the pond heater in figuring it would work. It turns out every time I plugged it in it would short out and cut off the electrical. I'm now in the market for a new pond heater. It was a shame to see those fish floating at the end of winter last year..."
1,Burned up after 1 year,I guess surrounding an item that heats up in plastic is not such a great idea. Should have known. Purchase an Allied brand. Mine has lasted for years.
3,pond heater,"I really liked it at first, worked great keeping my small pond from freezing over, but when I went to plug it in this winter, it wouldn't work and it had a leak. contacted company and they shipped me a new one after I sent this one back. product seems to work good first yr then die. but the company is awesome. no problems with them at all.I would like to add, i found out that if you keep the back end of this heater slightly out of water,maybe balance on a small rock or the pond plants,then you will have (no) problems. by keeping the area out of water where the cord joins the heater,it works great, my second one worked right off this yr when plugged in"
4,retro,"These are classic, they are $50 at American Apparel but much cheaper here or at Kmart. Kind of like a knowingly ironic thing, wearing a silver or gold digital watch. You too can be a hipster. Face is a bit small, good for a girl maybe. I like the A178W better though because the digits and face are a bit larger, better for a guy. They have both models in silver or gold, but gold can be harder to find."
4,UPS Sucks Late delivey became the gift that nevers deliver!,"I am very upset, the item is as described, I am upset that I bother to pay the extra in order to have the dam watch delivered to me a day prior my trip. The UPS did sent me an email confirming that they will deliver the watch that day. Then again I waited the whole day at home for a freaking watch that never came. The Dam UPS was a nasty service, I wish I could leave this feedback on their spot instead. Fedex seems more reliable. After I came back from my vacation I received the watch, the UPS delivered days after. I wonder what was the point of me paying extra for??????? There was not point since UPS did not deliver it on time!!!! So upset!!!I did not get to deliver the gift oversea. UPS sucks!"
3,"No me mató, pero me gustó","Fito es mi numero uno desde que recuerdo haberlo escuchado, su musica ha cambiado las vidas de quienes se esconden en el calido manto de su musica. Debo decir que desde mi punto de vista Rey Sol es un album diferente a los demas, no tiene toda la chispa de Abre, ni tampoco el lenguaje cinematografico de otros almbumes como c.beat o el amor despues de amor despues del amor etc... pero todavia salva algunos razgos medio Beatle:""Nadie sabe que hay en tu corazon..."" O a medio paso de tu amor, que le brindan ese beneficio comercial al que ya viene pre-favorecido.La verdad es para mi es el album mas hecho a la ligera en años, no tan elaborado musicalmente y con una crudeza medio rockera, no es el mejor pero si eres coleccionista es una obligacion. Para nuevos Fito-escuchas recomendaria el Amor despues del Amor, o Euforia, Para exploradores del rock latino esos 2 mas su obra clasica: Giros, Del 63, Cronica, Hey, Ciudad... etc."
2,DECEPCION .. TOTAL !!!,No se que paso en este disco pero es sin duda su peor produccion. Abre fue muy bueno pero este deberia ser borrado de su coleccion.
4,Love the functionality,"I was looking for a diaper bag that would not look like a diaper bag, and I also needed a laptop bag. This fits the bill. I love that you can detach the diaper bag part and leave it at daycare. It has a lot of pockets and looks like any other laptop carrier. The only thing I didn't like is that not all the straps are adjustable."
5,I dove this wreck....,I dove this wreck with the author in the mid 80's. I would like to find a copy of this book if anyone has it. List if can on this review site and somehow I get the book.
3,Great Criterion Reproduction.,"Criterion did their usual good job of restoring the original. Interesting study of pre-WWII Japanese nationalism and pointless gang violence with a the usual over-acting and improbable acrobatic fight scenes. The female lead is a sainted virginal figure in love with a fanatic nut case. The promotional material for this film suggests that the male lead is motivated by sexual frustration but that hardly explains his psychopathic anger. Ordinarily I find Japanese movies of the pre-war period fascinating but the overdone gang fights were a bit much. It ends on an indeterminate note, probably because the sequel was never filmed."
1,Not a helpful textbook,"The index is put in between the appendices of various tables and charts, if that tells you anything. To complete many problems you have to reference other textbooks and tables. It's a waste of space."
1,Not if you have a Mac 9.2,What they don't tell you is that if you have a Mac OS 8.62~9.2 &quot;support will be provided throught the VP-02 Web Site later&quot;... From what I understand te device drivers for our operating systems has not been developed and have no definite date of release. Invest in another MP3 if you don't have the latest Operating System.
2,Kalencom Seat Belt Snoozer,"We used this on our recent tri[ tp Florida, and truthfully, NOT worth the money...as little as it did cost.It spent pretty much the whole trip on the floor when I, not my daughter, was using it to sleep with."
3,can't use with bolster seat,This is a good idea with a regular bolster seat without a head rest--I didn't realize this when I purchased it--had to return it--my grandson is still in a full bolster seat
4,Worth the Money,"I bought one of these for each of my kids (ages 6 & 4) before traveling 9 hours in the car on vacation. They always fall asleep and their heads fall to the side. This attached real easily to the seat belt and it gave them something to hug while falling asleep. Once they were asleep, their heads didn't flop over like they used to when they used regular pillows."
3,Travel Pillow,"My kids love this pillow on long car trips. I was a bit disappointed. I still can't figure how to correctly attach it to the seatbelt. My kids are 5 and 3 and it seems to be better for the 5 yr old. My 3 yr old still slumps over, but doesn't go side to side, since she's holding the pillow. They love it and that's all that matters to me. If it were not for that reason, I would not make this purchase again."
2,Wouldn't recommend,"This product is much smaller than pictured. I didn't have any issue with the placement of the velcro, but it was too small and not stuffed thick enough to do anything. And of course,the biggest thing it cannot do, is prevent my daughter from tipping the other way while she's asleep!"
3,Nice bed,"I love the bed very sturdy, the customer service was fast to respond to my questionsSlow shipping, also I was told I needed a metal bed frame for the bed since i ordered a queen and the bed would fit around it, spend fifty bucks to find out that's completely wrong, the bed frame sits higher than the standard metal frame and all you need is the center bar that runs across. Not happy about the shipping and bad info givin"
3,Log Bed,"I asked the seller and the manufacturer if the king size bed came with center support. They both said yes. When we got it it didn't have any so we had to go to the lumberyard and have slats made. It cost us an extra $20. Without them, the mattress will sag in the middle."
3,"musica es musica, compadre","To celebrate his 20 years of carrer Celso Pina, the godfather of Monterrey's Ballenato, teams up with a bunch of mexican rockers and gruperos. Some of the results are very good and some are just good in crosspolinating generes. The ballenato-heavy-dub-hiphop of ""Cumbia Sobre El Rio"" and the hard funk of ""Cumbia Poder"" (featuring ""El Gran Silencio"") and ""Cumbia de la Paz"" are some of the most promising incarnations of true latinamerican music for the future."
5,Why Isn't This On No Strings?,"Well all I have to say is that this single is so good it is a shame it is not on the new CD 'No Strings Attacthed.' I first heard it on our local radio station and I knew Justin was singing, I never heard the song before and I had to find out where to get it. Of course Amazon has such a good selection I knew I could find it here and I am glad I did! Wow, this song rocks! It is slammin' from beginning to end and the other bonus tracks on the CD single make this CD completely worth buying. The remixes to 'Bye Bye Bye' are jamin', the first one is way better tha the second, but all in all this is a great CD worth the time and effort. I only wish I would have got it sooner! Five Out Of Five."
3,They're Never Gonna Stop...,"The second single released for the ""No Strings Attached"" album in Europe, the track was exclusive to that region, which is a shame because it really is a good boy band track, and sounds alot like their older singles like ""Tearin' Up My Heart"" and ""I Want You Back"". A little Max Martin gem of a pop song, sadly it lacks in the remix department, so the single is padded with the album version and an instrumental radio edit. As a bonus, two remixes of the prior single ""Bye Bye Bye"" are also present, but they're simply okay, nothing special productions. Of the two, the remix by Riprock 'n' Alex G. is the best, as the reletively short Teddy Riley mix begins to bore pretty early on, and at just a bit over five minutes, still sounds tedious and dire. A good song, but a poorly packaged single."
2,Too bad the writing wasn't better,"I wanted to like this book, I really did, but couldn't get past the 2nd chapter. The story line sounded so promising but the writing was so amateurish I just couldn't continue on.The writer hasn't learned to ""show, don't tell"" and uses very simplistic explanations of character motivations. Everything felt contrived. I get the impression this is a first writing attempt by a very passionate fan. Lots of enthusiasm for the subject but not enough skill to back it up."
4,Still holds up after all these years,"This is a fabulous album of garage rock. The Del Fuegos were the Zanes brothers, Don and Warren, along with Woody Glessmann on drums and Tom Lloyd on bass. Released in 1985 this was their first national album, and it still holds up next to the neo-punk of the new millennium. Almost every song of the ten is a keeper. These guys came to my attention via a Miller beer TV ad series that featured about-to-break-out acts in various local music scenes. Anyone else remember that? ""Don't Run Wild"" is the big hit, but the entire album is great."
2,"Bad, & Getting worse",I think Boyzone's A Different Beat is a real let down. It only had one good song Mystical Experiance while Said & Done was packed full of wonderful tunes. Major Boyzone fans only for this one !!!
1,Poorly written,"A jumble of ideas, poorly executed. Jumps around years at a time without giving even a hint to the reader what time he is supposed to be reading. A lot of hype built up in the first two books, only to be disappointed with the result in the third. Would not recommend, poorly written."
5,Easy to use and it WORKS!,"Excellent product, really easy to use. First, you have to locate the main gopher tunnel which is probably the hardest part of the process. Then, you clear out a space from the tunnel, set the trap, and butt it up against the tunnel opening. Make sure to cover the hole with some plywood or something opaque to block any light from entering the tunnel. I caught a gopher within hours and I just reset the trap. Highly recommended."
3,"Nice message, but is this what passes for a rhyming book these days?","One of my favorite childhood books was ""A Child's Garden of Verses."" I love poetry, even doggerel, that has great scan. I also love Ogden Nash, so I also enjoy rhyme with intentional, ridiculously ""off,"" scan.But this book is just plain really bad verse. I read it four times today, to four different groups of remedial-reading kindergarteners. They liked it very much, but I think it was mostly because of the illustrations -- particularly the two-page spread of the angry brain.Perhaps the publisher thought the heavy-handed message was worth overlooking the bad rhyme; it's certainly in line with the self-esteem movement. But I'd say the author's brain is not best at verse -- and part of the message was also to find what you're really good at and work ""at length"" to build that ""strength."" Maybe he wasn't encouraged to work at it ""at length"" to refine the text."
5,Best I've Found,Tried different brand from local candy store. It was awful! This has good strong horehound flavor without being bitter. Will order again when my supply dwindles.
5,"Love this old rockabilly, just wish he'd keep his trap shut re: politics!",Love this classic album. The album is full of the old rocker's classic iconoclastic music. Recommended for all fans of Hank Jr.
2,Herve Leger Perfume,I have been buying Herve Ledger for many years. It's my favoriate perfume. I understand it is being discontinued and I am very disappointed. I ordered several of the small perfumes and it is not the same color and it does not smell the same. I am very disappointed.
3,Ok,Book was cheap; the quality was what I wasnt expecting... Bent book overall some damage that wasn't on the description but price was pretty good
4,Fun seasonal book,"This is a cute book about a goose learning to fly and wondering why everyone else is so busy preparing for winter and he is just flying, not realizing that he is preparing for winter. We like it a lot! (5 year old, 2.5 year old and parents.)"
1,Truly disappointed,The same situation from a previous reviewer happened to me as well. I did not receive the correct Caboodles with shoes displayed on it. I receive a plain black one. Very disappointing...
2,Wrong design,I like it but I didn't get the design that i ordered. They send me the plain black color ;(
1,B/g framing nails,"Hello, complaint about the b'g framing nails ,they jam up the nailer and they won't line up in the guide ,the nails have tape to hold together ,your pic shows the thin wire which holds them together.looks like the tape builds up and keeps them from lining up in the track,I got some the bostitch nails with the thin wire from a friend and they work great ,so i think the b/g nails are junk even though I have used about half a box ,shoot a few ,stop unjam and shoot.eleminate the nails with the tape for the bostitck nailer. Thank Paul A. Salyers"
1,John Fogerty meets Miami Vice,"No amount of historical perspective and contextualization can convince me that this does not suck. Yes, synthesizers and electronic drums were enjoying undue popularity but the thing that makes John Fogerty John Fogerty is his lack of interest in the fashionable, hence his surrender to those trappings results in the most un-John Fogerty like CD he's ever put out.Now I'm not the kind of jerk that won't allow someone to try something new, but ""new"" doesn't automatically mean ""good""So does anyone else aside from me knows this sucks? Yes, John Fogerty himself does as he almost never, ever plays any songs from this wretched CD."
5,Underrated And Powerful In It's Angry Intensity!,"I think it is kind of sad when an artist releases a new album and people condemn it for not sounding like their previous CD's. We expect Evolution in everything but our songwriters it seems. It kind of reminds me of ageing accountant and lawyers who pretend they are ""hippies' again after they smoke some ""Whacky Terbaccy"".Mr. Fogerty had the guts to produce this very good album with synthesisers on it and not everybody could accept that he wanted to try something new and perhaps take his music to the next level. Such is the ficklessness of the General Music Buying Public at large. There is some great hard rocking guitar work on this album and I am happy to say that Mr. Fogerty has lost none of his very accurate Sociological Powers of Observation which can be heard in the track ""Headlines"" which is about the Power of the Media and asking just when does it reach ""Saturation Point""? This track alone makes this album worth buying."
5,eye of the zombie john fogerty,enjoyed the cd when i should have bought the album 20 years ago. i remain a big fan of johnfogerty as i was his band creedence clearwater.revival. a totally befuddled reverand al nunnelly i frankfort kysaw me sit and use headlinesand other tunes by john fogerty as i cut off and got rid of the broup chicago. john fogerty remains a favorite artist.
1,birding book,"This product appears as a book about birds. I was very disappointed to find it was places to bird watch. There are no color photos, nor any pictures of NJ birds. I returned it."
1,this is a normal TV!,"why did it cost so much. the sound is ok, the picture is no where near as good as flat screen or HDTV. This should be $100 less. this is a waste of cash"
3,Returning this TV for the 2nd time!,"Great picture and I liked the TV. However, the picture was crooked. There was a rise of over 1-inch from left to right. I took it back for a replacement, and the new one has the same problem, although to a lesser degree. I am taking this one back tonight. Everything else is great, but what a pain to return the thing twice. I have not decided whether or not to give Sony a 3rd chance."
3,JUST A TOY!!!!!,Other reviews complain that this is not a serious snowboard....HELLO!!!!!!!!! it's $24.99. Your NOT going to get a board worthy of anything other than some backyard fun for a price like that. Common sense
2,yawn,"I was quite excited when this movie came out because I personally wanted to see Liv Tyler attempt such a genre. Although her screams and wails were quite realistic and moving at times the movie itself failed to deliver any kind of thrilling horror. The storyline is not original but the fact that it was based on true events gave it some weight, unfortunately the movie had nothing. I couldn't help but see it as an extremely bad remake of 'Funny Games' the movie written and directed by Michael Haneke. The mind games took up all the movie time and built up the viewers expectations so much that when the end came it was kind of ""YAWN that's it?!?!""Also this movie probably had 4 lines altogether so not much to say about the script at all.I'm sad to say another disappointment in this genre of film."
1,pointless,"i love suspense and horror but this was dumb... every time i got excited cuz something was about to happen, nothing happened... i wanted to see it and saw a friend had it, she told me i could keep it then i saw why. anyone want my copy?"
4,Really a creepy movie,"I love horror films, and this is one of the best recent films I've seen. It is really creepy because I can see actually see something Like this happening in the rural area where I live."
3,Not bad...,"Welp! I have to agree with alot of viewers who pointed out the stupidity of the characters in the movie - it made me very frustrated at times - that being said, if one is willing to suspend belief while watching the film - and admittedly, you REALLY have to suspend belief, lol - it is a truly creepy, haunting movie - esp. because of the ""open for interpretation"" ending - I mean, let's face it - most horror movies are just not that good with the exception of the classics such as The Shining, Rosemary's Baby, The Exorcist, Stepford Wives (original)...-if a movie can stick in my mind long after I've viewed it, then to me, it achieved what it wanted - to scare the shi..t out of me. For example, I saw Blair Witch - and yes, I know, a lot of people scoffed at the film - but it truly creeped me out - so mission accomplished and who cares if the plot is retarded ;)"
1,no point,"theres was no plot, no point, just people walking into a house to say ""cause you were home"".....i mean cm'on....at least have some police there to discover what happened and clean up a mess...dont just leave people lying around with there door WIDE open"
4,Good Horror Film,This is a really good horror movie that was based on real events. The movie was scary the whole way through. I didn't give it 5 starts because I didn't like the ending.
1,Awful,"Do not buy this movie. I watched for one hour and fifteen minutes and then threw the DVD into the trash can. There is no protagonist, the behavior of the characters is ridculous, and the movie is too long and boring. You will want all the characters eliminated so that this terrible movie will come to an end."
4,In this genre - great movie and it makes you look for the sequel,"I'm a Tivo person and downloaded this because of the price. But i was amazed at how good the movie was. As one reviewer mentioned it is dark, but using more light would not allowed the ""scare"" tactics that worked so well in this movie. The bad guys/girls had so many opportunities to eliminate the 2 main characters but used the time to toy with them. I thought i could predict what would happen next, but was wrong many times. I've certainly seen some bad movies, but this one is worth seeing."
3,Scary and pretty good but something seems to be missing !,"For one thing, this movie was really scary probably mostly because of its morbid atmosphere. The plot is basically about a young couple that moves to a house in what seems to be the remote country side. Pretty soon strangers intrude on the couple, with each passing moment their actions and intensions become more and more threatening. The only thing that didn't seem to make too much sense was the ending, since it dosen't really end in a normal way. And one never discovers anything about the identity of those wicked stranges. If the end had been better done this movie could have scored higher, but the way it ends, more or less open ended, just dosen't satisfy my curiousity as to who those strangers are and why they decided to be so cruel to apparently unknown people around them."
4,Give this a try,"For what its worth, this is a pretty creepy movie. It's very suspenseful and feels like something can happen at any moment. There is a sense of realism where you can picture yourself in the same situation -In a quiet country cabin with no immediate neighbors, where you're easily startled by something out of the ordinary. In this movie that ""something"" persists and becomes a very real situation. One of the creepiest newer horror movies I've seen in a while."
1,THIS ONE IS WORSE THAN A BAD HANGOVER!!!,Nothing in this movie makes any sense. The entire film is full of holes. I am not going to list all of the mistakes because I see that it has already been done by another reviewer. I am just going to add that the ending on this movie was one of the worse endings that I have ever seen.
1,Lame,"This movie was very boring. I kept waiting for it to get good, but it never did. The movie says it was inspired by true events and starts off saying the events of a particular day are still not fully known. It turns out that the movie was only inspired by a would-be burglar knocked on the door of the writers home when he was a kid. Someone knocked on his door and asked if someone was there who didn't live there. That doesn't sound very inspiring to me! I guess that's why this movie was so lame. Don't waste your time."
3,chose victims wisely,"really? i don't know if this is realistic or disturbing. more disturbing, i guess. i found myself really being angry after watching this film. great premise, yes, but maddening as well. the resources at hand for the victims, in my mind, would turn the tables on a more aggressive couple. three on two, i'll take those odds with a shotgun everyday, especially when an ax is my biggest competition. and i'm getting really tired when the whole ""based on a true story"" comes across the screen. the Cohen brothers did it with Fargo and it was clever. Now, its just a copycat tactic."
2,creepy,"I was dissapointed, a friend recommended this movie, but almost no dialoge and bad acting even for a slasher film."
5,Love the movie,I've seen this movie once before and loved it. It was being sold at a very low price and I couldn't resist.
5,"No gore, just pure edge of your seat suspense!","Look at the cover on the box. That hood! There is something about people in hoods! When I look at this, it takes me back to a young age when we went as a family to see a film entitled ""The Town that Dredded Sundown"", the story about the Texas based Phantom killer in Texarkana. I'm not here to tell you about the film ""The Strangers"" in order to make it look like I'm some sort of undiscovered film critic. Simply put, this film is worth owning. However, here are a few pointers for watching: Turn up the AC in your house and put a chill in the room. Watch this film late at night. Watch it by yourself or with very few people. Watch it on a good size screen in surround sound with the volume up. There is a scene in this film that freaked me out enough to pause it, go get my gun, and then finish the film with my back against the wall. Enjoy!"
4,Thought it would be idiotic; it's not,"I watched ""The Strangers"" on TV, thinking it would be silly and mindless; I had other things to do. I watched and was held to the narrative, and kept thinking this is just another home-invasion, slasher film. I was wrong. Director Bertino put together an attractive cast, and found a sound crew of absolute perfection. This is psychological horror done quite well, without the blood and gore. It also helps that Liv Tyler and Scott Speedman handled their roles very well. It may have moved a little too slowly, and the 911 call at the beginning doesn't make sense, but it's a truly scary film. The final scene, with the Jesus freak kids, was clever. Not to be totally written off."
2,Disappointing,"FIO was a disappointing read. There is one picture per page with a very brief description on why the outfit is basically appropriate or inappropriate. As a previous review mentioned this book is about dressing the body shapes rather than focusing on additional issues plus-sized women have. My main pet peeve is that the photos on the negative side are very craftily staged. The models slouch, frown, don't hold themselves proudly and seem to do all they can to look bad. While on the positive side, they are beaming, standing in a great pose, holding their head up, (sucking in their gut when they didn't on the opposite side). Many of the ""inappropriate"" outfits would look much better had they been given the same positive spin. Not a book to purchase, just take five minutes (that's all it takes) to read it at the library."
1,not worth it,not worth the time or money unless you already know how to speak or write in spanish....a much better choice is the EURO METHOD INSTANT IMMERSION 33 LANGUAGES....where i work i need to know alittle bit of different languages and this product does better....
2,In the US Latin American spanish would work but Castilian???,"Disappointing, I want to learn Spanish to speak with the people that live here, I don't think a trip to Spain is in my future"
3,Not good if you want to become fluent in Spanish,"I ordered this book from a book club and when I received it, I admit I was a little disappointed. After browsing through the book, it seems like it is geared more towards people who DO NOT want to be fluent in Spanish and basically have to learn basic phrases if they are going to travel to a Spanish-speaking country. There was a short chapter on grammar, but it did not seem very in-depth at all to me. On the plus side, there was a CD that came with it and there is a pronunciation track on it which could be very helpful (but not completely sure, I didn't actually listen to the CD). Other than that is was just how to say very basic Spanish phrases. There was also a coupon for a free Berlitz Spanish lesson (unfortunately, there isn't one close to me anyway). All in all, if you just want basics, this is for you. If you want to be fluent, skip over this one and get Madrigals Magic Key to Spanish."
3,ok i guess,"it's an ok book,I don't know if you will be fluent in spanish but i'm still trying.and it's a little cluttered this book."
5,Graceland by Paul Simon,I bought this album when it first came out and just purchased the CD. It is no doubt the best work ever done by Paul Simon. It is timeless.
5,Beautifully done,Hours of enjoyment! Loved seeing the making of familiar songs and the personal thoughts of Paul Simon. Lots of footage I had never seen before.
2,Not as good as the original,This was a great album as well as video when it was originally released.when I played this remastured version after purchasing the first thing I noticed was this is not nearly as good as the songs on my vhs video. I should have researched first and found a better sounding version.
5,An absolutely incredible album...,"Its very hard to put in words how good this album is. Im young and dont really know the political significance it had nor do I remember the awards it won. BUT, Ive heard the album many times and know its good enough that I can not hold back from writting a review. The music Paul Simon has given to the public in Graceland is a gift of genius that is hard to define. If I analyzed every song Id be here all day, so in short: Their originality is moving and the talent behind each one is simply amazing."
3,Good but not classic,"I know I'll catch heat for this opinion but here goes. I always thought this album was very good, not great, but original in concept and execution. In my mind a great album is one of those can't live without, desert island albums. Albums that I play often over a period of many years and must have in my collection. I bought this album on vinyl when it came out and played it often for about six months maybe a year. I just bought a used copy of it recently and played it for the first time in many years. While I like the sound quailty and the unique arrangements, these songs just don't stand the test of time for me. I would give it four stars for originality, musicianship and technical sound quality but take away one star because half of the songs are just ok filler. Just my opinion. Paul Simon has made better albums than this."
5,a solid album,i have always respected the work of Paul Simon.his will to challenge himself is the mind of genius.combining the influence of South African Music is a bold and smart move all at once.the arrangements are richly done.a great pop record.the writing&production are solid on this set.
1,Non-Windows software incompatable with Win98,"On a Win98 machine the software doesn't show the answer side of the page. On an NT machine, ditto. Maybe some one person out there has a machine antiquated enough to accomodate Barrons (always out of touch with reality) but it ain't likely.This really helps nurses! Not!"
1,Must taste nasty,"We have a stray Black Lab that has adopted us, and the poor thing has arthritis something terrible. We bought the hip and joint ""pills"" that she loves. We thought that this would be a good supplement as well. Problem is, we can't get her to eat them! She spits them out almost immediately. We have tried mixing it in with other treats as well as with her regular food. No go. She eats around them like they are kryptonite. I smelled them, and if I was a hungry dog, I would have to stay hungry. Sorry ""Vets Best""....I can't say that this is a wonderful product if I can't get a stray lab to eat them! Maybe it is the white willow bark or the pineapple bromelain flavor. (If you have them in chicken liver, I will trade you!!)"
4,"So far, so good","Seems to help my elderly dog's arthritis. This is my second (30-day) purchase; I'll have a better sense if his improvement is due entirely to this product after another couple of weeks, I'd say."
4,"Slippery Characters, Interesting Autobiographies","In this book, Laura Browder examines many autobiographies and other autobiographical works from the ante-bellum era through the present. She focuses on individuals who have impersonated ethnic and class positions not their own--but not in the way we often assume either; she's not writing about African Americans who pass for white, for example, but about how individuals of various backgrounds pass for Indian, how whites have passed for black, how middle-class people have passed for poor. Her examination of these events is sweeping; her style is engaging and jargon-free. To me, the most interesting chapter compared the interpretations of black life by John Howard Griffin and Grace Hasell."
3,Expectations met.,This has decent sound for a clock radio and the display is large and bright. It has a simple appearance which I like. There are no birdsongs or gushing water sounds.
2,Disappointing,"I love Seventh Heaven, so it is with a heavy heart that I say this season was a dissapointment. It seems like all the good actors left so they start filling the season with fill ins. Peter is annoying and so is his mom Paris. Seventh Heaven is great through the sixth season, the seventh and eighth seasons I wish I had not bought. But the ninth season is better comparatively. I just wish Peter would go away."
2,Some glitches,"I bought this keyboard from Best Buy.It is not a very good keyboard.It has the following problems:When you are in the normal Octave (both octave lights on the left are on which is the default), when you go into G4 and above which are on the right, the keyboard produces a very muted sound. It is a drastic transition from F4 to G4 keys. It sounds OK when you set the keyboard to a lower octave.Also, in the normal octave mode, chords A minor and C sound the same. This is because when you hit the A minor chord the A note is hardly heard.Now I am looking at options. May be it is the particular piece that I got."
4,Could Be Up Your Alley; Too Mature for Me,"I only know Logic from this album and I must say he is not cutting things up too hard here. Most of the stuff here is at about the energy level of Air or like the mellower cuts on the last DJ Shadow record. This is not rowdy enough stuff for my taste. I was looking for a crazier turntablist pastiche, ala Peanut Butter Wolf or Australia's The Avalanches. If you want nutty cuts that are surprising and will move your feet and have strong beats, check out towards the end of the album, the cuts Hip-Hopera and Miles Away, which is all full of ""Sketches of Spain"" horns. Those two have me making spastic motions on the train if I have the headphones on but the rest of the album is for Medeski, Martin, and Wood fans only. Medeski actually guests on a track or two here even."
3,Kingston ValueRAM 1024 MB DDR2,"I bought two sticks of Kingston KVR667D2N5/1G for my wife's computer. I believe it was around $80 for the pair. I've had no issues with either, they popped right in and worked great. From my research I've found that upgrading from 667 to 800 would have been useless. This is a great price/performance bargain for a basic desktop PC."
5,BEST PRODUCT!,"easy to use,heats super fast very convienient! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!3 size rollers make the job faster and heated clips makes hair style stay longer!"
3,Decent,"It's okay overall. A little bit difficult, and not as big as I wanted, but for small rollers its ok."
2,LEAVES MARKS,"This product does leave marks in your hair where the clips are. I think I may just use a straightener to get rid of those, but still annoying. This product also takes about 10 min to heat up fully, rather than the promised 2. The curls don't last long either...only a few hours. I may take them back to get a more expensive set that will do a better job. The curls do look nice though. I have long straight hair."
1,Worthless!,"I rarely ever return items because it's such a hassle. But this, is being returned immediately. The idea is actually very good- it has a side heater to heat up the clips as well as the rollers, a feature I've never seen before. However, the clips do not hold- at least not in my long hair. No matter how many times I tried, the rollers would always fall out within a few seconds. Even when I stayed completely still (very difficult when putting in the remaining rollers) they would still fall out. They never stayed in long enough for me to see how well the curlers worked."
3,Rollers are good but clips SUCK,I have to say that these work well but because the clips aren't very strong it doesn't stay tight and does get hot if touching your face. I suggest getting different slips for these.
2,conair - dissappointed,"I bought the Conair instant heat rollers to replace my old Conair rollers which I was very happy with. Unfortunaetly I found that I did not like the new version as well as the old. It does not heat up as fast and whereas the old had a high and low setting this only has one. Also found that the heated clips leave dent marks in my hair which the wire clips did not. I use the Conair super clips which I bought separately instead, would use my old wire clips if only I could find them."
5,hair setter,I really like the Conair Ion Shine hair setter. I find the curls last longer and it leaves my hair shiny and in good condition. Not like the old hairsetters for sure! Your hair looks like it was done in a salon!
2,Don't Like This Product,"I don't know what I expected....maybe something a little better since it has the Conair name on it. The rollers get plenty hot, but the clips are a pain to use and don't hold. They also leave crimping in the hair. Wish I had purchased the jumbo rollers with the regular metal clips that hold better. Now I'm stuck with something I probably won't use much."
1,Hate the clips,"The rollers literally fell out my first time using them. The clips are horrible and have no grip whatsoever. My hair is slightly past my shoulders and normal thickness. The ""stay cool"" edges of the rollers burned my fingers. I haven't tried any other kind of clip other than what is sold with the set. I can't tell you how well they curl because I couldn't get the rollers to stay in my hair. I am not happy with these rollers."
2,Shine Instant Heat Hairsetter,"I like how quickly the rollers heat - a vast improvement over waiting at least half an hour. However, like the other reviewer said - I absolutely hate the clips. They are all one size, so they are too large for the smallest rollers. I also don't like them because they don't keep the roller still like the ""U"" shaped clips did, and they leave a dent impression in my hair. I don't recommend them primarily because of the clip system."
5,Great rollers!!!,"These rollers a wonderful. I find them very easy to use, and my curls stay in, the clips are great and easy to use."
4,A DIFFERENT KIND OF ELECTRIC ROLLER,THIS ELECTRIC ROLLER SET IS A LOT DIFFERENT FROM ANY ELECTRIC ROLLER I HAVE USED IN THE PAST. I LIKE THE CLIPS THAT HOLD THE ROLLERS IN THEY DONT GET HOT LIKE THE METAL CLIPS DO. WHEN I USED IT FOR THE FIRST TIME I LIKE MY RESULTS MY BOSS EVEN NOTICED MY HAIR..ASKED ME WHAT DID YOU DO TO YOUR HAIR..??? IF YOU DO BUY THIS ROLLER SET.. YOU SHOULD PRACTICE BEFORE USING IT...I WAS GLAD I DID.
4,OK- no clips,"Wish I had read the other reviews before ordering. I also had no clips. I think they should be required to change the advertisement of this product if the clips are not available. Curlers work well and I was in need of a new set, since after a while the cushioning comes off and it burns the hair."
2,Don't Curl My Hair...???,"I bought this the other day and they were $22.77 w/ Prime Shipping. And now it says almost $8 shipping, and $29.99. So that's weird that it's so much more expensive now. (it's still $22.77 @ Walmart.)Anyways, these didn't curl my hair. They made my hair SLIGHTLY wavy. (I have naturally straight, thick hair.) See that girl who posted 2 pictures, one w/ curly hair and one w/ straightish hair? The straight hair is what my hair looked like AFTER I left the curlers in for 15 minutes. This is weird, because my hair is normally really easy to curl, and it stays until I wet my hair. My favorite curling iron is Conair's infiniti curling wand. (I have the pink one because it supports breast cancer).The clips also didn't hold very well. Pieces of my hair kept falling out of the curlers. (Don't think, ""Oh, that's why it didn't curl her hair!"" because that's not true. Some of the pieces DIDN'T fall out, and even they didn't curl.)"
1,Awful,"I have had many sets of curlers, and theses are by far the worst. The plastic ""clips"" to hold your hair on the rollers cause a crease in my hair - that looks very awkward. I called the company (Conair) and complained & they said nothing. :( I took them to the Goodwill."
1,small cheap curlers,"These curlers were a complete disappoinment. I have an older version that I needed to replace and the quality of this new set is nothing like the old ones. The size of the rollers is a joke, unless you have very short hair. The clips are large plastic claws that are hard to open and the heating feature of the clips requires you to heat two at a time. I ended up returning these rollers."
2,Not as advertised,"If you like big dents and ridges in the top of your hair left by the roller clips, this product is for you."
4,Good product,"My only complaint is that you have to keep putting the clips on the posts to heat them, as there is only enouh room for three clips to heat, seems like there should be a place for all the clips to heat at once instead of using one, replacing it, using another, replacing it, etc."
3,I can't keep the darn things in!,They heat up nice and fast but the clips are kind of flimsy and don't hold the rollers in place very well. I have never used hot rollers before so maybe I just need some practice.
4,Heats well!,Love this product! It heats well and the quality is really great! The product arrived as the seller stated and was more than what I expeted! I would recommend this to anyone!
3,They are ok.....,"Sometimes they curl great, other times not so much. Agree with other posts that the clamps leave a dent, bought some wire ones and I'm much happier"
1,Not what I expected,"I had a Conair Instant Heat Travel Size Jumbo for about 10 years before it got destroyed while moving. I absolutely loved it and wanted the exact same thing but thought it would be nice to have the large and medium sized curlers as well, though I primarily use the jumbo. I was completely shocked when I opened this and saw the size of the curlers. Even the jumbo size were waaaay too small. I use them to give body to my straight long hair and none of the sizes were suitable for that. I immediately shipped it back and ordered the Travel Size like I had before. Very disappointed this wasn't what I thought it was."
3,"Pretty, but not the best.","They look nice, love the pink. Doesn't really make a nice, defined curl. I have some cheaper ones that do a better job. I don't think I like the felt material rollers as much as the rubber or hard plastic ones. Also, invest in some of the cheap, old fashioned style pens that will hold the rollers in more firmly. The clip style holders don't hold as well and puts too much slack on the curl, thus resulting in a loose sloppy curl."
2,Should never have been released,Recognizing that the recorded songs were original demo versions this does not get it. Sun Mountain is the same concept and is much better.
4,Dukesfest,"A mediocre game that you will beat within hours of its arrival. But well worth the purchase for the cut scenes that mimic a Dukes of Hazzard plot. For those of us who watched the original show as kids, this is the next best thing to reruns (stupid TNN stopped airing it!)."
3,Romeo et Juliette vs. Romeo en Julia,"This musical has become one of my absoulte favorites. The music may be in a different language, but it captures you...You can't help but fall in love. The French recording is the origional, and is very good, but some of the singers aren't of outstanding quality, and the french language doesn't seem to fit the music in parts. What I would recomend is Romeo en Julia, Van Haat Tot Liefde, the Dutch version of the show. The music is very beautiful, and all of the singers are fantastic. I would recomend both of these to anyone, but I feel a true musical lover would appreciate the dutch version, available at footlight.com"
5,quiet essays on the 1990's,"For those enjoying Peggy Noonan, her thoughful essays of how her life evolved in the 1990's will be a delight.The topics are not especially political (although politicians are mentioned). The first part is about the lack of vision by Republicans that led to Clinton's election. The later essays, however, are mainly about personal transition, including that of being a single parent and returning to spiritual values.Much of this mirrors the evolving lives of the baby boomers as they grow up: the real story that occured quietly and behind the scenes and not in the flashier stories on the 1990's.However, those who are allergic to discussions of religion will probably hate it, as will those who hate Peggy Noonan for her political history."
1,I change my order but still charged,"I bought a this replacement plan with a item I planed to get. ( a mpeg3 player) But before the item had been shipped , I changed my order to another player. But then I was still charged for the replacement plan on a item that I did not buy. I called the company and they refused to take care of it for me, they told me it was amazon's fault. I emailed amazon and I still have been billed for it. I have done bussiness with amazon but after this experience I may never buy a product from amazon again. They do not have a phone number. I will protest the payment on my credit card"
1,low budget,"Please dont waste your time, the first 5 minutes are the only good part in the movie, the rest is like the 1st black and white dracula.... boring"
1,Avoid this movie,"Atrocious. This is one of the few films I'd bother reviewing, if only to help someone else avoid it. Just don't bother."
4,Good Fleetwood Mac,"This album was an excellent album. I thought it was an awesome twist using synthesizer sounds, unlink previous albums ""Rumours"" and such. Tango in the Night was over-all a very good CD. None of the Songs disappointed me. ""Big Love"", ""Seven Wonders"", and ""Everywhere"" are my top favorites. However, ""Tango in the Night"", ""Little Lies"", and ""When I See You Again"" are still excellently written songs. One of my major disappointments in these songs were the lack of lead guitar. Compared to other albums, it didn't compare at all. For it being Lindsey Buckinham's final Fleetwood Mac album, I think he should've impressed me more."
5,Great effort!,"It may not be another RUMOURS but still very good. Songs like Seven Wonders, Everywhere, Mystified, Little Lies, and Isn't It Midnight are the best. Lindsey's songs are awful! I give most of my credit to Christine McVie. ALL of her songs are good! Stevie's are pretty good too BUT still not as good as Christine's!"
3,"Good sounding, well produced generic pop/rock","The ""classic"" Fleetwood Mac line-up released just five recordings during its decade plus of existence. The first four are excellent and although none sounded better than Tango this is my least favourite. Tango is very much a child of the eighties and, as such, several of the songs do sound dated (Little Lies, Family Man). I find that I can play nearly any FM song from any other album in the band's repertoire and it will not sound out of place in 2010. Play almost any song from Tango and it will scream out ""late eighties."" To me Tango In The Night is for the most part well played, well produced and great sounding generic pop/rock. I like the title song, Nicks' Seven Wonders and McVie's rocking Isn't It Midnight. Big Love is a sensational song. Sadly, other than the one song, Stevie's contributions are not up to her normal high standards. This is not a CD that I'll be revisiting soon"
2,Tango In The Night,This is A easy listen project from Fleetwood Mac.The best song is Seven Wonders preformed by Stevie Nicks.
5,Another great FM album,"It's really weird to hear Fleetwood Mac in such an 80s context, but it works, once again. This is truly an album a casual listener can enjoy just as much as the die-hard Mac fans."
2,Half Very Good Half Horrible,"I've never heard an album where there is such a dichotomy of quality of the songs. Easily Stevie Nicks worst moment - her songs are embarassing here. Lindsay Buckingham also hits a low here with Christine McVie as the only saving grace here with her songs. The 6 good songs here are really good Big Love, Seven Wonders, Everywhere (it starts witth a BANG!), Little Lies, Isn't It Midnight and You And I, Part II are all excellent and the other 6 songs - Caroline, Tango In The Night, Mystified, Family Man, Welcome To The Room...Sara and When I See You Again are absolutely horrible. Buy at your own risk and be ready to skip a lot of songs! Mirage is SO MUCH BETTER!"
2,Stacked doesn't even have chips on the table,"Poker Players beware...if you even played poker before, this game is like Mtv in an old folk's home. The game play is slow, the characters are not that lifelike. It just doesn't make sense to go into it with a 2/3 off suit, and they do! They win with it too! Buy WSOP it is way better!"
1,Can't even see the license plate through it anymore,This is the worst license plate cover I have ever bought. Had to remove the rear one before the police stopped me as you can't read the plate through it now. I pulled it before it was even a year old. Complete waste of money.
2,Not pleased,"Was missing the front rod, hard to get any service, impossible to get replacement parts...friend put it together and manufactured a rod for me! Go to a store...save time, which is money to me, and make sure all the parts are there!"
4,A great but short read,"The third Sluggy book is just as great as anything else Sluggy. It has all the charecters (Torg, Riff, Zoe) and even introduces new ones. All the stories in this book are funny and like most Sluggy books they're weird. Due to the odd way this title is presented I reccomend buying the other Sluggy books to know whats going on in the complicated Sluggy universe. Even if you don't buy the other books the adventures in this one will quickly have you laughing. The only problem with this excellent book is that it is a bit short (even with the new comic added) and could be read in only a few sittings. However it's great and can be read again and again. Highly reccomended for fans of sci-fi movies & comics and anybody who enjoys odd humor."
3,"It's OK, but...","While this book is entertaining, I found the level of graphic violence to be more than I would have liked. Also, I live in Tucson and Cole obviously does not. He gets details about the city wrong, which takes away from the authencity of the story for me. For example, he refers to Highway US10 several times. It's an interstate, so it's I-10. Perhaps that would not be noticed if you didn't live in Arizona, but the lack of research on matters like this bothered me."
4,Textbook on Management Decision Making,The book was required for a fast paced MBA course. The case studies are relevant and up to date. The book arrived timely and in good condition.
3,A good read but flawed,"Susan Isaacs is a great writer. I'm a native Long Islander and identify with her books and have enjoyed them all. This one is definitely the weak link in the chain. The first half of the book gets bogged down in too much generational stuff. I had trouble keeping everyone straight. (Now WHO was Charlie's great grandfather, the guy who jumped the train or the guy who married the rancher's daughter, etc?) By the time Charlie and Lauren were introduced, I didn't know who was who ""relatively"" speaking. The story line was great, but not enough time was devoted to character and plot development. There should also have been more of a sexual tension buildup before Charlie and Lauren hopped into the sack. My opinion? A quarter of the book should have been devoted to ancestors, three quarters to the main storyline and Lauren and Charlie. Going back two generations would have been sufficient."
1,A BIG DISAPPOINTMENT,"This book disappointed me so much, To think that I've read ALL of Ms. Isaacs's books and loved them all. This book was one big bore! It put me to sleep at night and I had to force myself to hurry up and get it finished. The ending was soooo predictable and the storyline sooooo boring... I just hope next time Susan Issacs goes back to her witty, funny style that is so enjoyable to read. I loved Lily White and Almost Paradise, etc. Reading about Wrath was the most boring torture to have to go through! Was it necessary to go so much into detail about such a stupid and unbelievable organization? Don't waste your money nor time on this one. I should have believed the reviews I had already read in Amazon."
1,Sony KV27 is bad bad bad,"I bought a Sony KV-27 18 months ago, I admit the quality of the picture is good and this is why I want to pay more to own it.But it stop working today after some strange flash when I powered it on. One of my friends has the similar problem with her Sony 27'' WEGA just after 2 month use, she has to pay >$200 to repair it.I must say the quality of sony products is bad!"
2,Pocket Full of Pubes,"When I read one of Irving's other books while eating dinner, I nearly lost my appetite. There is something sickly obsessive about the main characters of Irving's book who all seem to have disturbed sexuality while enjoying wrestling. But after the dismemberments in ""The World According to Garp"", this is pretty tame. At this point, it would take a lot for Irving to shock me with his graphic sexual imagery. Only with a personal photo could he top himself.I read somewhere that it takes Irving four or five years to write each book. It only takes Stephan King about a week and a half. Anyway Mr. Irving, here's hoping 2009 takes a long time to get here."
2,"Lots of pages, lots of potential, but a lousy result","Had this novel been written by someone other than John Irving, I would have put it back on the shelf after 200 pages, but I am a huge John Irving fan and kept waiting (and waiting) for him to deliver. The pages kept coming, the potential for a wonderful novel was there, but in the end: a big miss.My chief complaint: as John Irving has become more successful (and wealthier), the net worth of his characters has increased, and they manage to solve -- with relative ease -- the financial hurdles that ordinary folks would find impossible to conquer. Frankly, the emotional troubles of the well-to-do lack substance when these same problems would exert far greater woe upon those who work for a living. Mr. Irving seems to have lost touch with this concept, and lost touch with his faithful readers in the process."
1,YUCK AND DOUBLE YUCK.,"I always look forward to Irving's books, but this one is truly awful. (I won't summarize the plot; read the other reviews for that.) It's unbelievable (EVERY FEMALE WANTS TO ABUSE JACK, NO MATTER HOW OLD HE IS) and disgusting (EVERY FEMALE DOES ABUSE JACK; except for his teachers). While i was reading the book, i just got angrier and angrier. I almost threw it across the room. I finished it, but only because I HAD to know how it turned out. The twisty ending is interesting (Alice lied to him about everything) but that's about it. I'm tired of Irving's recycling of the same STUFF: prostitutes, rape/sexual abuse, wrestling. And now he's added child abuse. At least there were no bears in Amsterdam. This may be the last Irving book I spend money on."
1,So disappointing,"Good value with regard to the number of pages... but the story misses by a mile. None of the characters are in anyway sympathetic. The narrative jumps around various cities in Europe and North America providing boring descriptions of churches and their organs. Whereas in other Irving books the unlikely characters are somehow real, the tattooists or other people he describes are barely two-dimensional. The penis holding episodes, size of penis etc are just plain weird and appear without any relevance to the storyline. I could go on. By the end of the book I was just glad to have finished and I didn't believe in the characters or care what happened."
2,"This is NO ""Prayer for Owen Meany""","John Irving's characters are often quirky and sometimes you don't like them very much, but Jack Burns and all the women in his life evoke no sympathy, and little interest. Were I not a John Irving fan I would have stopped reading 50 pages in, but I held onto the faith that he would pull it out in the end. How could a man that crafted the genius of Owen Meany write a story with so little interest? Read ""Until I Find You"" and you will see that John Irving has missed the mark this time and has failed to make you fall in love with the main character!"
1,Read his others instead,"So, so bad. At his best -- A Widow for One Year, for example -- Irving is Balzacian/Dickensian/Sterne-like in his energy, robustness, tenderness, humor and sheer narrative pace and force. This misses out in just about every way. Irving is obviously a major, major novelist so my negative review of this piece is just an alert to anyone who has not read his earlier work that this is almost certain to be a disappointment; but perhaps part of being a great writer is risk-taking and pushing of boundaries so from that perspective this is just a push too far. Read Widow for One Year instead and marvel."
2,"Boring, boring, boring",I had read a lot of John Irving when I was younger and was excited to read a new book of his. But this very long book is way below his usual standard.The characters are unlikable and not believable and it just goes on and on. If you want to read John Irving try his earlier work.
4,Irving is still superb,"Its not as good as Cider House or Owen Meany or Garp. But its the next best after those three, imho. I've read all his books, and I'm glad to see him back on his game. Don't start with this one, if you haven't read him, but certainly don't discount it due to some poor reviews on here."
2,"Until I Find a Better Story , by John Irving","John Irving said in an interview that getting through these 800 hundred plus pages would pay off in the end for the book's readers. The only satisfaction I got at the end of it, though, was the thought of not reading it anymore. It's not worth the time you'll spend on it. I think John Irving just needed to put something out."
4,Irving is Irving,"John Irving is my favorite writer, and partly because I never have the slightest idea what his next book will be like. I always scream with delight when he finally releases another novel, because they are far and few between and always interesting. Definately there are some which I loved more than others, and this was not my favorite. A Prayer For owen Meany and Cider House Rules were definately favorites, but like another smart reviewer mentioned- you do not want the same story everytime! With Irving you can always expect colorful, well drawn characters, and you don't have to love the characters to find them worthy of being read. Irving, in my opinion is always worthy- and he's definately the greatest writer of his generation!"
1,Garp again?,"No doubt John Irving is a great writer. So why has he re-written, or re-packaged another ""World According to Garp""? The names of the characters have changed, the locations - mostly, but the plot is a rehash. Too bad because he is a great writer. Time I think he needs to move on to different plots, step out and take chances, he has the chops, why does he hesitate? Come on John, we've read this already, go someplace new, enough of the absent father, we get it!"
4,Acceptable for an Irving fan -- terrible for a newcomer...,"That's the synopsis of most of the past reviews. If you're a real Irving fan, you'll rate the book 4 or 5 stars, even though it may not be his best -- it's still got Irving's style.If you're new to Irving, start with his older books -- anything BEFORE ""Son of the Circus"" -- especially ""Garp"", ""Cider House Rules"", and ""Owen Meaney"" -- and get an appreciation for a great author.I hope his next book reaches those levels once again."
1,Yuck!,If there was a way to give a book zero stars I would. This hurts because I adore John Irving and have used his books in several of my classes. I agree with the previous reviewer in that I would feel extremely guilty passing this book on.
2,Until I find you.,"I liked how Economist magazine noted this best selling novel, ""John Irving has lots of fans. That, or there are thousands out there willing to pay for 1.4kg of penile obsession"""
1,heartbreakingly bad,"This was the worst book I have read in a very long time. I am usually a huge fan of Irving but this book took me months to get through (while I picked up good books)...I finally just started skimming to get through to the end. I agree with all the other honest reveiws of what an awful book this was. No connections, no point, no story, no plot, no character connections, no good all around. I am so heartbroken that Irving could write such an awful story...and 800+ pages of one too!Save your money and your time...read Kite Runner!"
4,Pike Street Micro Bead Pillow,"The pillows are a bit small for a king/queen size bed. Very comfortable and certainly a good price. Great pillow for those with neck or back problems, firm yet plyable for sleeping comfort."
2,Stuffed too full - so it's not soft enough,"Stuffed too full and cover is too small making the pillow too dense and hard. I bought it at 6am after a great night's sleep at a friend's house but once it arrived, I couldn't use it. I am debating returning it or simply removing some of the little white bubbles from inside with some creative surgery and sewing."
1,hard,this pillow is soooo hard.i get nothing but ab extreme headache off this pillow.it fills like a bean bag type make up.i hate this pillow and i quit using it.save your money!
1,This pillow is hard as a rock!,This pillow is beyond firm; it's like laying on a street curb or a bag of concrete. The filling in the pillow does NOT adjust to conform to your head and neck. One night on this pillow gave me a migraine (literally). Not a good product in my opinion.
2,not good for my neck!,"The first week I slept on it, it wasn't too bad but than after a while the beads seemed to shift more away from my neck not supporting it as much as I needed. I will be trying to return this, it's not worth the money!"
4,Good if you're looking for a firm pillow,"This pillow is not soft and it feels like a bag of sand, but it does adapt to the shape of the body so I sleep comfortably. The pillow has two drawbacks. First of all, the stitches are not well done so the beads are leaking. (This is not a big problem for me since I always keep the pillow in the cover that came with the pillow and the cover doesn't leak anything.) Secondly, the pillow smells very badly, and the smell persists for weeks, so I couldn't use it right away."
5,great firm pillow!,I love this firm pillow and the height is perfect! I have been using it for 3 weeks and it's so comfortable!
3,Too firm - but interesting.,"So, if you like a firm, side-sleeper pillow, then you have the right product here. However, I might be able to fall asleep on the pillow, but half way through the night, I wake up looking for a pillow to exchange. It's just a bit too firm for my taste. You would think the beads might shift around a bit more, but be not mistaken... this is not the case. It is an interesting pillow though, and I like it - just don't love it and certainly could live without it. It's not bad to prop my head up a bit when I'm reading in bed, but I wouldn't say it's sleep worthy...at least not for a full night's sleep or for days on end. It ironically kind of hurts my neck, and that seems counterproductive for a therapy pillow."
1,Too hard,This pillow is too hard and too high. It looks nice but doesn't provide comfortable sleep. I was disappointed.
1,exploded,have one where the beads are all ove I have no I dea what to do to fix it it is in a plastic bag I finally bought a my pillow in place of it
2,Micro Bead Therapy Pillow,"This pillow is not what I expected it to be. At first, I compared it to sleeping on a brick. I have gotten used to it, but I would not recommend it as the ""cure all"" to a good nights sleep. If you like a extra firm pillow that hardly gives at all...then this pillow is for you."
1,Not worth it,"I've enjoyed extra firm side gusset pillows for several years as a side sleeper. This pillow looked like a good switch that would probably hold up for several years and keep my head cool. After using it two weeks until the pillow started leaking beads, it was neither. Instead of the pillow conforming to my head and neck, my head would sit on top of the pillow without any sort of give. I found a way around this by fluffing the pillow while my head was resting on it. I used the spandex cover that was included since the first day but it made the pillow stiffer and less breathable. As far as the pillow being able to breathe, I would wake up with sweat under my head when our room is kept around 70 degrees. Overall, this pillow did not last and was not comfortable enough to want another."
2,Hard as a Rock,"This item was very hard, and not really the soft and squishy microbead pillow I was looking for. I am not satisfied."
4,1st decent night sleep in months !!,"Could this BE the ONE.. ?? It is looking like it. I am thrilled..I have been struggling to find a comfortable pillow.. having bought unknown numbers of them that I have tried and threw out.. It has been really bad over the past month with waking with pain in shoulder, neck etc. I feel like Goldilocks trying out pillowS.. with pillow to hard or pillow too soft... Or... PILLOW JUST RIGHT...well I finally resorted to searching the internet and stumbled upon this pillow. Well it arrived and I tried to put it into the accompaning pillow case.. NO way... tooo tight and made the pillow way too firm.Well pulled it out of the case and into a regular pillowcase... and VIOLA.. a perfectly manageable pillow..Night #1 to bed at 10.. woke up at 7:30AM... HURRAY.. no pain in shoulder or neck...Night #2 to bed at 10 woke at 7 AM... HURRAY .... no pain ....FINALLY..I think I have found ' THE ONE'"
3,hard,very hard like sleeping on a rock and tiny tried and tried to sleep on thinking it would get better with time
3,Nice Pillow-Did not meet my need,"I had hopes that this pillow would decrease neck pain at night. It did not. The beads are packed too tight so the pillow does not change shape easily so I can get the support I need for the neck area. Both edges of the pillow are about the same height so flipping it over does not lower the head. Difficult to get a cradle hole for the head. The first pillow I received had a hole and those micro beads escaped over a large area and was difficult to clean up. There was no problems with exchanges, got replacement right away but had to take it to UPS to send back and print a return ticket as well.Its a nice pillow (material quality) if you have no sleep issues but don't expect it to fix any sleep problems."
3,Big Enough but hard as a rock,"I like the style, when I tried to sleep on it my chin felt like it was on my chest. Maybe after I get it broken in it will be okay but for now I prop myself up with it to read in bed."
1,concrete pillow,"This pillow feels fine in your hands but when you lay your head on it-it is concrete! Total resistance, no fluff, no give, the pillow transforms to rock hard, truly a phenomenon! Yes it is cool temperature wise but it is unforgiving comfort wise! A great foot pillow!"
5,Pain in the neck no more,I was having terrible trouble with my neck and was going to physical therapy and decided I needed to switch pillows so I purchased this micro bead pillow and the combination of the two helped me to be pain free. This pillow conforms to your neck and head and provides great support. My mother was having neck pain so I told her to purchase this pillow and it has helped her neck as well.
3,Good product but does not last,"Loved this pillow, however it did not last long the beads leaked out and made a mess. Would not recommend."
2,It's a Brick,"So I purchased this pillow to help curb my increasing pinch nerve neck pain. Let me just say it's about as comfortable as lying on a brick. No give. And it's hot regardless if you put a pillow case on it or not. I used it a few times and was curious to see how it was holding up. Opened up the soft case it came in - and beads burst out.. Styrofoam beads everywhere - good times. I would recommend the Cervical pillow instead - it did wonders for me - no more pain, no more shoulder pain or numbness in my arms and hands or biting pain in the shoulder. check it out - a better option IMO."
1,lousy pillow,It is a very firm and hard pillow...no getting around it. would not recommend to anyone.
3,It's a good pillow - but not for everynight,"The pillow cover is useless. I discovered that the reason they even give you the cover is because the pillow itself is highly flammable. There is a warning on the label. But the pillow doesn't function as it should with the cover on it. It is way too firm with the cover on it and the beads aren't able to move around. I like the pillow without the cover, and in fact, without even a pillowcase. Even a pillowcase prevents the beads from moving like they should. So basically, it's a nice pillow without a cover on, which means it won't match the other pillows on your bed, and it will be highly flammable. You choose!"
2,This pillow smells toxic.,"This would be a great pillow if I could actually stand to have my face near it. It emits a smell like airplane glue. My husband says it smells like fiberglass epoxy. I have put it in the dryer on No Heat to try to remove the smell. I put my vacuum on it and let the air get pulled through it. I have left it to ""air out"" for the last two weeks. Still the smell is overpowering. I am sending it back."
3,Really firm!,"I expected this pillow to be somewhat pliable. It is so firm that my head does not even move the microbeads. If you are expecting the pillow to give and form to your head, then this pillow is not for you. If you want a very hard pillow, this will be up your alley."
4,Micro Bead Therapy Pillow with Cover,"Cover is warm, Pillow is stuffed tightly...Not as cool sleeping as the one I picked up on HSN...but it serves very well for travel"
1,Too hard,This is very stiff and hard...not the beaded soft pillow I thought it would be. This is extremely firm....so returned as soon as I touched it.
1,Not for me,"Pillow feels squishy and soft - until you put it on the bed and try to sleep on it. Too much fill, not enough give. Too big for under my neck, causing my head to be at an awkward angle. Gave it three days, went back to my old pillow.Might be good for someone with a bigger frame than me, or likes a very firm pillow."
1,Magic Chef - do they exist?,"Purchased in 2007, it stopped working in 2010. Went to web site and found repair shop, Magic Chef referred me to in my area. They had never fixed or even saw an ice maker like this. I paid $149.99 for it and was told repairs would be $108.00. They said the motor costs $65.00. When I went to the web site again, I found the part costs under $20.00. I called Magic Chef, customer service was too busy. I left messages 3 times and they never returned any of calls. Finally, I e-mailed them, really wanted to know why they recommend someone who never saw the machine before and why the difference in parts costs. All they said it was not under warranty. No other explanation. If it had broke under warranty..it makes me wonder if I would have heard from them at all."
4,remodeler,They fit the Dewalt 51321 nailer just fine. I also have used this system to install cement tile backer sheets around tub and shower framing. What a waste of time using a hammer!
4,Funny album!,"Very funny! Only one track not too fond of, but overall funny! Definitely college humor. This has adult content!"
1,Annoying footage in between...,"Who wants to see visitors to a ""day out with Thomas""and hear what they have to say about Thomas and company? Who wants tosee that lady's gum as she talks about how her older son wanted to name the younger one Thomas the Tank Engine (they compromised and cut off the ""Tank Engine"" part)? Self congratulatory and annoying fill between every episode. Buy a different video."
2,Not that much fun,"This toy looks good on the box, but it is not that much fun. It is to hard for a five year old to put together and it does not stay together. It wobbles when you try to stand it up and parts fall off continuously. The parts do move and easily but it just does not stay together that well. Do not purchase this as a toy your child would actually play with or they will be disappointed."
3,Uneven,"From 1986, ""Get Close"" is one of the Pretender's most uneven album. Highlighted by sensational cuts such as ""Don't Get Me Wrong,"" ""Hymn to Her,"" ""My Baby,"" ""Chill Factor"" and ""When I Change My Life"" rank with their best. Unfortunately ""Dance,"" ""How Much Did You Get For Your Soul"" ""Room Full Of Mirrors"" etc. are little more than uninspired filler."
3,Fairly Good,"This product makes a good appearance but is either too flimsy for the cost or too expensive for how flimsy it is. Not bad, just a bit pricey for what it is."
5,Stimulating And Easy Reading,"I bought this book because I needed to read it for a class. I didn't expect to like it as much as I did! The first couple of pages made you really think and wonder about how mindless one really is. The book did wonderfully in keeping the psychological jargon out, and the examples helped me understand the concepts. I would definately say that this book is a must-read for everyone."
2,My least favorite of among Mindfulness resources.,"Ellen J. Langer's Mindfulness (Your Coach in a Box) is probably my least favorite among Mindfulness resources I have read. I bought both the CD and the book, hoping to utilize it with people I teach mindfulness techniques to, but it has no real guidance on mindfulness, just a bunch of information about it. I was definitely hoping for a teaching aid and I got a longwinded description."
2,Don't buy if you have kids,"First of all I love Martin Limon's books. I think this is a great series and I buy them as soon as they come out. Having said that, Buddha's Money was a bit disappointing. The story was the usual but there was some horrible torture of a little girl. To the point of being repulsive. This just turned me off an otherwise pretty interesting book."
1,"For the love of God, pls read a lot!","The only thing I would like to say is...please if you want to make a book critique on the other side's (in this case Catholicism) please read alot of good books, specially from the official teachings of the catholic church, secular, historical books on christianity or much better the ""Early Church Fathers"" by Jurgens. You will be surprised that the early christians and writings of like Iraneus, Polycarp and others who were students from the apostles themselves taught true christianity and you will find that it didn't have any similarity at all to modern-day protestantism (which I think somewhat like modern day relativism- to each his own).And lastly, the book was poorly researched and bias."
2,Not helpful if you need a concise treatment of the subject,"As a Protestant in the process of converting to the Catholic church, I decided I needed more substantial information about what I was getting into. RCIA just doesn't tell you about the church doctrine. I was hoping this book would clearly spell out in simple terms what the differences are between the two. A quarter of the way into the book the author had lost me. The writing is hard to following and the reasonsing at times is impossible to follow.If you need a basic, straigh forward treat of this topic, this is not the book for you. I understand the author has a pro-protestant bent, but I would have appreciated a more even handed approach to a very puzzling topic."
5,"New fun, funky emergent reader series","I love the Todd Paar books! Neon-y colors and goofy, childlike art make these very simple books stand out from the crowd. Things that make you feel good include bubble baths, pets, hot chocolate with marshmallows, and bedtime stories. Things that make you feel bad include smelly feet, stinkbugs, worm stew, and monsters. The combination of things that are real and things that are silly will make you laugh and maybe take life a little less seriously. If you're a kid, there's an important self-esteem message in these books that the littlest kid can relate to."
4,My first Dead,"This was the first experience with the Dead and I'm glad it was because it led me to a whole new world of music. After watching this a second time after hearing much more of the Dead's music, I truly appreciate this great film. The Dead were never really known for their energy on stage, but rather for the music they played. This has some really decent music (""Built to Last"", ""Desolation Row"", a great ""Deal"", ""Drums"", ""Johnny B Goode"", and ""Not Fade Away""- just to name a few) but it also really great as far as the energy goes. Jerry was all smiles and was moving quite a bit. It's a great reminder of how great the Dead really were. This is an awesome DVD, although I can't seem to find it on Cd........."
4,Bachman Christmas Train Review,"Its a lot of fun. I put it around the base of my tree as just a circle and it is very entertaining, especially when company comes. As far as educational value, its an HO train set and well teach about caring for breakable toys and how trains work. It teaches about a hobby. The couplers which hold the cars together are flimsy but they never came apart. The power pack is cheesier than the ones that came out years ago so I never leave the house with it plugged in. The snap together track is very easy to put together. When I was a littleboy we had a train set. All the trains were made in the USA, and the power packs were by Model Rectifier Corp, and they were also made in the USA. Those were the days."
1,Chinese Junk!!!,"Feel free to buy this tool if you don't mind DESTROYING every piece of tubing that you attempt to notch with it. Misses the mark by about 1/4"""""
5,Molto Bene!!!,I could listen to this CD all day long and not get bored with it. I listen in my car and at work. Its so soothing to listen to and Bocelli's voice is amazing! This CD is a definite one to buy!
5,Vivo por ella is a duet with Martha Sanchez,"Great, just change the name on the vivo por ella track, it is with Martha Sanchez (Spanish singer)"
1,Sorry - he's off pitch,"It's hard for me to imagine that an Italian-speaker made these recordings, when there is so little involvement by the artist in the presentation of text. I'm glad his fans are so happy to have recordings from him. But this is not opera as it can be presented onstage. Nor is it particularly interesting dramatically. I had to wonder if he's aware of the dramatic circumstances of several of the arias. And that is the point: he is singing words that possess meaning, not just loud or soft for the fun of it. For the curious, these are some of the reasons Mr. Bocelli is not given high praise by musicians and those who critique (which means ""analyze"") operatic music."
3,ITALIAN MEATLOAF,"Signor Bocelli demonstrates his fine vocal ability on the album's few shining moments, notably Rapsodia, E Chiove, and the two bonus cuts, Miserere, and the duet with Sarah Brightman. Otherwise, save this suitably named collection for those melancholic moments gazing into the glowing embers of your fireplace, your love's eyes, or if you're very lucky, both."
1,Negative Review,Item I received did not look as pictured above. Company was hard to find on internet and refused to provide assembly directions. I will never order from this company again. The shipping to and from company was twice the price of item. NOT A GOOD DEAL!!
2,it ok but not good for $25,"It does not look rich and the digital little screen is too small to see date and time.I do not recommend this for those folks who want their hand look rich with superb sports watch.Picture look like robust watch but when it came on to my hand I feel it is light weight and delicate.Guys, it is not my recommendation.Thanks,"
5,Nice Watch.,I have never worn a Casio watch before and I am liking this one while playing tennis. I love the design and features in this watch and I am thinking of buying one for my nephew. You will not be disappointed by this watch.
3,Should have bought a G Shock,"This watch is OK. I still might buy a G Shock, as this seems a bit too flimsy and feels like it will break soon. It works OK, and I will still use it, but I really like a G Shock, like I had before."
4,"Nice watch with water resistant, recommend it","I bought this watch because I want to see time when swimming. I have brought it to the swimming pool for at least 3 times and it works fine. The appearance is also very cool. The only thing is that the crown is not very hard. I once put it in my pocket with a key chain. The key scratched the crown a little bit. Personally, I do not think it should be scratched by just a key, so I think the manufacture should consider to make a harder crown (cover).Overall, I think it is a very good watch with both analog and digital time display. Recommend it!"
4,Got what i ordered...,I ordered on behalf of my friend. He is a great sports watch enthusiast. Eventually got what he wanted and he's happy with the look and feel of the watch.
3,Smaller than I thought,This watch is extremely small. I didn't expect it to be so small. I also thought that the gold accents would look better.
2,This is a silly watch. Digital info is so small it can't be read without a magnifier. The tiny instructions are also uneadable.,"Once the package has been opened you can't return it except by reselling it through Amazon.I decided to keep it rather than accept the small return I might or might not get through Amazon.Besides, I like the built in light that makes it possible to read the analog time in the dark."
4,The Scottish Lowlands' Gaelic heritage.,"The Book of Deer is one of the most neglected Scottish historical resources...It is an important piece of evidence in the search for Lowland Gaelic... so too is it the earliest known Scottish Gaelic. It appears to have been written in response to the Norman plantations of the period, since although Gaelic had been written down in Ireland from an early stage most of the land contracts were oral, unlike the Anglo-Normans who wished to colonise the Scottish lowlands. Thus it is a good counterweight against much of the later historical revisionism in Scotland- most people in North East Scotland are unaware of the book or the fact Gaidhlig had been spoken in the Lowlands.The text of this book alone is worth five stars, but I'm afraid the pictures are not very interesting, which is why I've taken a star off. By the way I believe PBE is co-author, not sole author of this work. This work has gone some of the way towards making this book better known."
1,Very disapointed,"I owned a Farberware SS electric skillet for over twenty-five years. When the bottom of the pan would not hold the base any longer I decided to buy a new one. What a cheap piece of junk! The first thing I noticed was it didn't weigh anything compared to my old one. That, of course, leads to uneven cooking and hot spots above the elements. It didn't even sit level on my counter top. I had to modify (level) the base because Farberware wouldn't respond to my email complaints. So even though it's not even a year old it's headed for the recycling bin. No more Farberware for me."
4,A good look at actually being in a combat zone by guys who were there.,Several short stories by three members of a LRRP (long range reconnaisance patrol) during the Viet Nam War. A small book with a lot to say.
5,Wintertime,"This is a very good book, for children and older alike. A funny twist on christmas traditions. A must for all Tolkien-fans!"
5,Good for kids,I bought this for my younger sister (6 years old)She loved the book and wanted it all read on tolkiens writing side though his handwriting is terrible and the publisher typed the letters on the backside.She loves it so I enjoy it 5 star
3,Seemed a good idea,"I am a big fan of the Vet's Best Ear Relief Wash and Dry products (which I rate Five Stars), so it seemed that this would be a convenient way to use the wash. While is it convenient for a very minor touch up, it does not contain enough product or cotton surface per swab to clean the ears fully. I am not comfortable with using a swab for other than the outer ear and flap and prefer to use the liquid for a more thorough cleaning."
2,Not good for naturally oily hair,This shampoo does not do a great job cleaning my hair. If I wash my hair the night before it is always extremely greasy in the a.m. My hair has a tendency to be quite oily (I have long fine straight hair) but it is even worse with this product compared to other shampoos. It looks and feels soft at the ends but the roots are horrible. I am thinking of using this product once a week and find a better daily shampoo so that I will not have to wash my hair everyday as it is making my hair color fade from over washing. I do like the scent and texture of the product but it just does not seem to work well with my hair type. I am not certain if it is really helping retain the hair color since I have to wash it so often. I will use the remainder of the bottle and then will not repurchase in the future.
4,Good stuff,"Excellent quality, great price, fast shipping and reasonable shipping charge, what more can I say?"
1,unacceptable!,"When I got the staples in, they came in a used box (not the box that the staples should come in) and were just tossed in the box so almost all the staple bundles were broken some as small as a 1/2"". Do your self a favor an get your staples from another vendor..."
4,"Great voice, great music","If you're looking for a modern jazz singer with a lesbian edge, this CD is it!"
5,Changes and changes,The quick delivery of the DVD was excellent. Also the quality of the DVD is great and you enjoy whatching it. The sounds and theme song is very familiy like and there is so much to learn for a teenager about change
5,Christie Clark is AWESOME!!!!!,I loved this movie!!! SOOO GREAT!!! Better than the book!!!! Christie Clark is a WONDERFUL and Very talented actress!!!!!
5,Wyclef is Back!,"Ever since listening to songs like Jaspora and Sang Fezi from Wyclef's Carnival Album, I always wondered what happened to the Creole in his albums? In every consequent album he released, no songs in Creole. This marks a new beginning in his music career, he started his own label, his previous CD the Preacher's Son was a great hit and I see many great things in the future for Wyclef. If you are not Haitian, don't worry, I'm not either, but you can still enjoy his songs and the rhythm of Haiti in his songs and his voice. He gives props to Quebec and Montreal; he has Muzion perform on one of the tracks, so to any Montrealer, such as myself, its good to hear some of his songs. SAK PASE!"
1,stinks (2),I quite agreee: I had exactly the same result-- attempting to fold the thing up it simply twisted itself into junk.
3,Crown staples,The product works fine. The way it was shipped is the problem. The box of staples was placed inside a larger box with no packing material. The staples were broken into small sections. This makes it very hard to load and get the job done. I will go to Home Depot or Lowes next time.
5,A great book for boys!!,"This book is by far the most informative children's book on snakes I've ever found. It is very exhaustive, is written in simple language, and encourages children to learn about and understand snakes for the creatures, not monsters, that they are. Anyone, young or old, who is interested in having a pet snake should read this book. Anyone interested in hunting snakes should read this book. There is information about how well every snake does in captivity, how to care for them, and how to find them. Too bad this book is so hard to find now."
2,"Unreliable, difficult to troubleshoot and repair","Although the units are convenient when they're working, they're very inconvenient if something goes wrong. LaCie doesn't have good troubleshooting software. Instead, you get a flashing blue light--really helpful. Taking the drives out and putting them back in is difficult. I'm concerned that the reason two of the four drives failed in ours is because they got too hot. The units are only used for backup, so they don't receive intensive usage."
2,Poster,"Sorta got duped on this as I though it was the movie, oh well I should have read it closer, my fault."
4,It's the Rico Act!,Project lover is the coolest song on this album.Other than that there not too many other tracks that stand out. Still a great Album.
4,Nail Utopia,"Aurangzeb should pack some of these nails on his way to Mitchell Bros. for protection from, shall we say, the elements. Besides being totally wood-compliant (!), these nails would make for a great conversation starter at Mitchell Bros. for both Aurangzeb and Trenton."
4,Best about Brazil,"Brazil is a very complex country and full of different angles. It is as big as the US, but very misunderstood... and for some it is even totally unknown.For the great majority of the world, Brazil is still perceived as the country of Pele (the soccer player), the coffee drinks, a crazy Carnival, bananas everywhere, the pretty ladies, and little else.Well, this DVD will show you something more than just the ordinary by looking into the ordinary of this land. It will show you another side of the Carnival, another side of soccer, a few characters living with their daily chores, the beauty of nature and the abysmal differences of cultures from north to south.It is almost complete, for it could not fit in some other geographical areas of the country(like the sunny Northeast and the Europeanish South, for instance). As a matter of fact, it'd need a full collection of many DVDs in order to make someone really understand what this big country seems to be."
4,Space Ace - Very impressive version,The high definition remastering of this game is very impressive. I would recommend this to anyone who owns a blu ray player and likes Don Bluth's animation.
2,Far too imperfect for the money.,"It is amazing that in this day and age Digital Leisure has failed to perfect this game on Blu-ray. While reasonably fun, it still has enough glitches to break it. When playing ""ACE"" difficulty, for example, the cut scene with Dexter in the space ship with Kimberly on the monitor pleading, ""Get me out of here!"", is missing. Did they really think fans of the game wouldn't notice something like this?Using the PS3, with the latest firmware, there are glitches a-plenty, and it is too bad. The best part of this disc is the extra material with Don Bluth and company. I am sad to report the the most perfect version of this game on a console, although not as pretty as this blu-ray version, seems to be the version released by ReadySoft on the Atari Jaguar CD, which I still own. Same goes for Dragon's Lair. Of course, many of the PC versions are just as good or better."
1,R -rated?,"I rated this game 1 star just for the porpose filling the space,don't have it, but still might get it. I didnt know there was an R-rated version of this game. I thing its a type-o. Anybody else?"
1,Bad packing,"Received these 10,000 staples in a 6 inch by 15 inch by 20 inch box.All the staples were loose and when the UPS man handed the box to me it sounded like a box of broken glass. Half of the staples were broken. They were in a Amazon Box."
5,Fingernail Rescue,"I have used Biotin for several years, my Doctor advised me to take that because my fingernails were so bad,peeling and splitting like onions.Ever since I followed his advise,it took about 6 months ,my nails are beautiful,I leave them natural looking and get many compliments."
1,ALREADY EXPIRED!!!,"I JUST OPENED BOTTLE AND NOTICED AN EXPIRATION DATE OF 8/12! WELL, IT IS NOW 2/13 AND I AM HIGHLY UPSET I AM UNABLE TO GET REFUNDED ON THIS. NEVER AGAIN, SWANSON!"
5,Enjoying Expansion,"My family members are huge Bang! fans, so it only made sense to add the Dodge City Expansion to our game. We have children ranging from 6 to 16, and all love playing this game. The expansion is great because now there are enough cards to stretch the game to eight players. Great fun!"
5,Excellent,An excellent introduction to Zoroastrianism. Anyone interested in comparative religions will love this book.
5,I'm Getting There!!!!,"Tony Earley...after reading ""The Blue Star"" let me know that he is a gifted writer with a knack for taking the reader to a special place and time. That special place: the innocence of a child that some of us can relate to and unfortunately a lot of us cannot. And the time: far away to a simpler life of GOD-fearing people that worked hard and did anything to perserve that way of life. Tony Earley is on my list now. As of today I am only one book away from his entire collection(that I know of). I'm so excited!!!!"
5,Inner Directions,"I ordered this because I love Eckhart Tolle and it sounded really good. Turns out this is a reissue of Eckhart Tolle recordings originally released from 'Inner Directions' in California.Incredible stuff!!! One complaint, Sounds True cut out the applause Eckhart got at the end of his talk on the 1st disc, it really added an exciting flair and gave a window into the freshness and enthusiasm at the time.Classic stuff. Highly recommended."
2,Very poor sound quality,"Another wonderful CD from Eckhart Tolle, but the sound sound quality is very poor. The hissing noise (NOT the background/audience noise) if it weren't for his usual brilliance and delightful humor, it would be impossible to enjoy."
3,Another to own in a long list of short lengths,"3 1/2Delicately orchestrated entry in an endless supply of EP's, JD falls on the stronger side, just short of consisting of three must-have tunes, yet still providing an airtight breeziness."
4,Great Movie!,"I was expecting Hell Night to be another one of those cheesy 80's slasher flicks, but then i watched it, and found it was so much more than that. It'shighly original, entertaining,well acted, and beautifelly shot. It's pretty sad that it wasn't appreciated for what it was when it came out, due to the sudden rush of slasher flicks that premiered at the same time. In the end, i HAVE to thank Anchorbay for the great quality and extras on this dvd. It was about time!"
2,Nahh.. I'll Pass.,"Linda Blair, is the Queen of Horror. I jsut don't like this movie. I have seen movies like it SO MANY times before. If you Like Linda Blair, nad you wanna watch a movie with her in it, go with Summer Of Fear."
2,:yawn:,"It took me about 4 times to actually sit and watch this entire film. It seemed lame and cliched. I had just bought the movie and brought it to a friend's, getting high. We tried watching it but instead got bored and I felt embarrassed for the actors and director and because i actually attempted to watch it with my friend who is sitting there like ""Oh my god, turn it off."" So... The only good part was the decapitation of this one chick's head. It wasn't worth my money to buy, if you're young and like cheap thrills, rent this movie- it's for you."
4,Future Queens of Blues-Funk in development!,"Enough music maturity to recommend even though they were flowers still blooming! Favorite tunes: ""Gasoline"", ""Evil, mean and nasty"", ""Funky speacial"" (Radio favorite, ""So Funky you can smell it through the speakers""!) and ""Detroit Blues"". These Ladies get played often on The Crazy Coyote Blues Power Show 1490 KOTY AM (1490koty.com) Yakima Nation Radio in south central Washington state."
1,pretty boring,I love old horror movies especially old zombie movies but this one was very disappointing. The movie was ok but the gore and death scenes sucked. And everyone kept standing next to and walking by zombie like they weren't affraid then they got killed.
2,Not Squirrel Proof!,"I purchased this feeder at a local store to detract squirrels - the squirrels love it! In fact, they can jump onto it from the ground, hang on it and tip the seeds out. They empty it in about a day. If you have squirrels, don't waste your money. I gave it 2 stars for it's durability."
5,my review,"jamie and ste, two boys in a soccer team who seem to have grown up together or been friends since high school...well maybe they haven't but still, the 2 main characters...seem to be around 16 yos...jaime lives with his mom, ste lives with his physically abusive father and brother. we see thruout the film ste having bruises all over his back. jaime's mom knows this and looks like after every beatin poor ste recieves allows him to sleep at her place in jaimes bed. they talk....then sleep. the two friendships begin to bud from here on then, jaime likes ste and in one situation kisses him...both are dealing with being gay and the story goes from there. from the funny drunk lady to the sympathetic bf of jaimes mom...a great movie based in london. a wonderful coming out story and a beautiful ending. a must watch!"
3,What a great movie.....but such a sad DVD :(,"I love this movie and it's a great, fun story of coming of age in Thamesmead, London....but it is just so unfortunate that the movie hasn't yet been released on DVD in the US so that we have to resort to settling for this Chinese import. The fact that you canNOT turn off the Chinese subtitling on this DVD is really distressing since, otherwise, it would be a very good transfer to DVD. No menu options, captioning options, scene selection or other standard DVD menu options make this incredibly disappointing. If you are a die-hard Beautiful Thing fan, as I am, you'll be happy to have this DVD, but otherwise, the video is just as appealing, if not more so. We'll all just have to wait for the distributor to wake up and take note that US/Canadian audiences want this out on a well-produced DVD.......SOON.......PLEASE!!"
1,Great Story - DVD is POS,"This is a great movie and I have the VHS which I will be keeping because the DVD is a POS. (Its the main reason I've given it a rating of one.) The quality of the DVD is ... and the color (especially on red) is so over driven it bleeds and is almost unwatchable. I've seen better quality on VHS! Then there is the issue of Chinese subtitles **BURNED** into the picture. How bush league!!Unfortuately, I bought this some time ago and just decided to watch it again. Needless to say I went balistic when I saw the burned in subtitles. This little ""feature"" was NOT noted in any of the details. Amazon.com should offer to buy all thiese back."
1,I'm sending it back...,"Loved the film, too bad the dvd is such a joke. If i had realized I wouldn't have purchased it. It's so bad I suspect it's infact bootleg.I'm hoping Sony Classics releases this dvd in the standard to which i'm accustom to."
1,DO NOT BUY!!!,"I wish I could give this straightener ZERO STARS but I can't. I bought this straightener at the beginning of December and after exactly a month, it simply stopped working. I typically have had very good use out of Vidal Sassoon straightening irons but this one is SERIOUSLY below par. The little light turned on which meant there was electricity running to it but it just would not heat up...AT ALL. It was ice cold no matter what I did and I am returning this to Amazon because it was a complete waste of time and money."
1,piece of junk.,"I ordered this item in october as a birthday gift. It was opened and barely used and now it doesnt heat up at all. The small red indicator light turns on but the iron stays cool as ice. The few times we did try it, it worked well. Too bad we were unlucky enough to get a defective one, either that or it is just very poorly made.Since it was purchased as a gift it wasnt even opened before the return period ended.What a dissapointment. I cant even contact the seller or request an exchange."
5,Exactly what it says it is,This cd was used as a relaxation/sleep enhancer. I was looking for cd that had audio of thunderstorms along with some exotic sounding birds etc. This was exactly what these cd's are. For the couple of bucks you can find this for on Amazon it is worth the money. Only one of the two tracks are suitable for sleeping IMO. The one that isn't has multiple large bird vocals that will change the mood or wake you up.
5,Watch,Wife loves it. She does a lot of outdoors stuff so this is great and looks good too. Lighted application is great.
4,Approval from a toddler teacher and mom,"This book is about discipline, not punishment. Too often people associate discipline (teaching) with punishing children. But the best way we can teach is through example and positive reinforcement. It we want our children to create a more peaceful and non-violent world, we must not model violence by hitting/spanking our children. This book is a good resource on how to teach children what they need to learn without teaching them those things we don't want them to learn."
4,works well!,"The only drawback is that it doesn't fold away. I've had it for 1 month. It was easy to assemble, sturdy and the pilates machine fits well on the stand."
1,broken,"I was anticipating the use of wireless headphones with my ipod and looked forward to the new technology, howver, after several frustrating hours I determined that the naviPlay system was flawed in that there was something not connected internally as a rattle was heard from the interioir. The item was returned.I did enjoy the experience of purchasing from Amazon.com from beginning to end and will use their service again."
5,GREAT BOOK!,"I really liked this book. I recommend it to anyone, especially those who don't really like fiction (a few exceptions but...). GOOD BOOK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Difficult to review,"Being in an internet pen pal program, my student picked The Misfits for her book. She is in the forth grade and seemed to enjoy the book very much and was able to follow most of what the author was attempting to bring from the story. Of course, from an adult standpoint, it was a very easy read. The author did attempt to flesh out the characters and give you a reason to cheer or jeer them.In the authors favor, I was taken back to my school days when I knew everyone of the student characters and of course the teacher that did not enjoy freethinking students. Very relateable to any school kid, especially those on the outside. Against, though, I would have to agree with other reviews that some of the story lines seemed to come out of nowhere and some were not tied up before the end. For grade readers, a good moral thought provoking story, for anyone reading above 4th grade, the simpleness may cause boredom before the moral is seen."
5,best book ever,"A group of kids call themselves the ""Gang of Five""Bobby-kind of a heavy kidSkeezie-50's likeJoe-very femineAddie-a really smart girlThey band together to run for student council. They will be known first as the Freedom Party then the No-Name Party.Bobby, the narrator, learns alot in this story. Things like why his boss is so mean to him, how much courage does he really have , and who wrote the secret note. It is a very enjoyable book and anyone who reads it will love it."
3,EASY READ,"The Rebel Raider is an interesting read which details the life of Rear Admiral Raphael Semmes of the Confederate Navy, and his captaincy aboard the CSS Alabama. The book gives a description of the building of the ship, and it's commissioning. It details a number of raides in which the Alabam partook, and the many victories it achieved during its commission. All in all the Alabam destroyed 61 ships - 60 merchant and one Union ship during its tenure. The book goes on to explain how the Alabama's life came to an abrupt end, and takes the reader through the rest of Admiral Semmes life. ""Rebel Raider"" is a very interesting book, and is extremely easy to follow."
3,"Good information, poor editing","This book is a pleasant-to-read survey of influential American heathens. It provides great history and lots of intriguing facts about Americans who have rejected a belief in an intervening god.Unfortunately, the editing is terrible--names misspelled, facts given backwards, punctuation in the wrong places--I wonder if the writer even bothered to proofread this before handing it over to the obviously inept editor. It's hard to read a book when you're constantly having to go back over each paragraph to determine what was actually meant. Also, the writer has an annoying habit of ""telling you what you're going to tell them, telling them, and telling them what you told them"" a bit too often. It seems he's trying to use unnecessary words to fluff up the pages and make a longer book.The 3 stars I gave this book are based on content--perhaps it might have earned 5 stars with better writing and editing."
5,wonderful,"I recieved this as a gift from my husband, and I have to say that I am very impressed with it. Not only does the water not get cold, it heats up so hot, that sometimes you have to turn it down. The cheaper counterparts dont even compare. All of the massages pieces and pumice stone type things are great too. You will want to use this every night. I had my reservations about the high price, but honestly its great, enjoy, and try not to fall asleep."
1,Britney Spears,It is pretty sad when Ms Spears' fans start listening to this band. Do yourself a favor and buy Afraid of Sunlight again and pretend it is a new album: you'll have a much bigger thrill... trust me.
5,Marillion defines 'EXCELLENCE',"This is a 'must hear' album! I agree with the previous reviewers that say that Marillion has put out some albums prior to this jewel that were still good just not great ... I was elated to listen to this album and have since been able to also obtain the two disc version. Songs I think stand out 'Fantastic Place', 'you're gone' (yes upbeat (compared to the more darker songs on this album, kinda out of place but still an excellent tune), and from the double album the epic 'ocean cloud' is a treat. I just love this band and I suggest everybody to get out there and 'discover a lost art, play marbles'"
2,Not So Good - Maybe I was wrong,"I don't understand the good reviews for this album. I bought it after seeing the good reviews and after hearing Neverland. Sadly, after getting the album I found that Neverland is the only good song. The record is boring. I have listened to it at least 5 times over the last few months, and it doesn't sound any better. I wasn't impressed with this album at all.IMHOI have been listening to this CD again. Now it is growing on me. The CD isn't that bad. You have to listen to it several times to know the parts that are good and which are bad. Evidently I can not change my rating, but I would now give it 3 stars."
5,Bravo Amanda!,"Amanda Ashley has written another wonderful vampire romance! Antonio and Victoria are wonderful together and the story was very entertaining. I could not put the book down and was anxious to see how it ended. Bravo Amanda, for another wonderful and highly entertaining story."
2,2 great actors & 1 breathtakingly beautiful actress,"And story development process is interesting. Hackman and Freeman, they know how to act. Italian-born Monica Belluci looks hot. The problem is the story. Not very interesting or attracting."
3,Hackman and Freeman....what more could you ask for?,"I expected a little bit better from these two guys. Not too many fresh ideas in this film. But it is still worth the watch. It does have some slow spots to it...but it is worth it in the end. So...if you are looking for an average movie about ""Who Done It?"", give this movie a look."
2,Flop Of An Ending,All I have to say is that all the way up until the end this movie was great... then they destroyed it by trying to give us that 'big twist' ending. Boo.
5,Pounce cat Treats,"This is the only treat my Red Persian will eat. She is very large, and will eat everything in sight from the other cats in my home, But this treat is the only one for her. If I put out something else for the other cats, she will leave it alone, and wait for this one. I'll be in Big trouble if this is ever discontinued."
3,Worth owning for only the most diehard CdS fan....,"Nothing can be taken away from the acts in this show. As usual they are superb, though a bit dated when one compares them to a present day ""Mystere"" or ""O"".My one fear is that this show will go out of production and there will not be a new DVD to replace this one. This DVD has poor lighting and bad camera angles, so much so, that I am quite surprised that CdS still stamps their name on it in 2004! It simply is not up to their high standards. 5 stars for the acts, but 1 for the quality of the recording presented here.To anyone who is listening in Montreal, please film another show!"
5,Better for children than the live performance,"As is true in any similar performance, no matter where you sit you miss some detail of the action. And no matter how well behaved small children are, the live performance is long for small children. The video allows the kids to watch their favorite parts with no blocked vision and to see closeups that are unavailable to them in the live performance.For adults, the live performance is an experience only partially duplicated on the video - although the video is well-made and edited. It does, however, provide an opportunity to enjoy the Cirque until it comes around next year - without incuring the cost of a trip to Las Vegas.Other reviewers have given a good description of the show itself - high wire, contortionists, strong men, juggler, boleadoros, mime, live music, trapeze, bungee cords etc. It is a nonstop show of physical control - timing, strength ...If you can't see the Cirque live, treat yourself to this video."
2,"Very shallow, buggy code samples, has questions/exercises","I recommended this book to some programmers I was teaching .NET to. I liked that it contained questions and exercises, much like a text book, so they could do those on their own.However, the sample code that we downloaded from the publisher's web site would not even compile most of the time! And most of the code samples are in ASP.NET, which they were not yet familiar with, and the into to ASP.NET and the instructions to getting IIS set up was incorrect and confusing.As for subject matter, this book is a very superficial overview of ADO.NET, but I guess what do you expect in 24 hours.The most redeeming quality was that it included exercises and questions at the back of each chapter which allowed me to not have to spend hours writing those myself so for that purpose I found it useful."
5,Seems good.,"Just got it, so I don't know about its longevity, but it's not new to begin with and it's working really well. Very happy so far."
2,best in genre,"although i dont have the cd, i cannot let you buy it, its completely randomized powerchords under an old bald fat guy screaming his head offif you like screaming, you can probably look past the lack of musical talent, but i doubt it"
4,change can still be good,"Zao comes out with yet another album and yet, another change. Ever since ""Where Blood and Fire..."" almost every album has changed, but Zao still held true in most of their efforts. This album is VERY different from their past albums, especially if you look all the way back to ""The Splinter..."", but it is really well put together and sounds great! With the return of Russ Cogdell on guitars and Dan Weyandt back on the mic., you knew something good had to come from it. It's still strange to not see Jesse Smith on the kit; afterall he was the only one left from the ORIGINAL Zao. Never-the-less, it all worked out and this is an album for Zao fans to have. Of course, keep your musical minds open because it can be a rough listen if you're fully focusing on the older albums."
1,No Thanks--,"I don't know why this band broke up, but this album would have been reason enough. This very well may be a compilation of out-takes that was released after they broke up. Just say no."
2,Far from being his best...,"Benson's long career has seen him doing excellent things and not so good ones. This album is to be sent into the second category. Actually, only two tracks are really worth it, ""kisses in the moonlight"", which he sometimes performs live, and the rythmic ""shiver"". That's it. Fortunately enough, Benson seems to have overcome difficult moments and his latest two cds (That's right, and Standing together) are great."
2,Drys out quickly and becomes very sticky/gummy,"This stuff starts off okay, but quickly dries out and becomes very sticky and gummy. Adding water renews the lubrication."
5,Useful for Course,I used this for background information on the development of communities of practice within airlines. Good examples of how the airline runs.
5,The Southwest Airlines Myth,"Professor Hoffer-Gittel demystifies the successful Southwest Airlines business plan and in the process debunks the myth that Southwest's success is attributable to a non-union work force. In fact Southwest Airlines is one of the most highly unionized airlines in the U.S. Southwest is successful, in large part because they recognize the value of good relationships with their customers, their vendors and with their employees. Recommended reading for all managers, in particular airline managers who are seeking some inspiration and a plan to successfully emerge from the current economic crisis in the industry."
3,Description of this watch is incomplete,"I could have liked this watch, but there is one important feature that is not mentioned anywhere in the description. It has a cheesy camouflage band. Indeed the inner part of the band is leather but it is covered with camo material on the outside. This model is the ""Hunting Timer."" The watch also seems exceptionally heavy to me. I'll be returning it."
4,Solid Product; Does It's Job,"Fellowes Hot Laminating Pouches, Letter, 3 mil, 100 Pack (52454)is a very useful set of lamination sheets for preserving documents/items that are 9 x 11 dimensions (slightly larger than a letter sheet of paper). Easy to use, you simply insert the respective document/photo within the pouch and place it within the tray of the lamination machine. When utilizing the pouches, I used aScotch Thermal Laminator 2 Roller System (TL901)as the lamination source. The end result was a document tightly laminated without a hitch. What more is their to say? The laminating pouches easily do their job upon the initial insertion within the machine. Highly recommended."
2,wash your finger,"boring martial law, and flag was still there are the only 2 songs worth playing, paint the white house black has cameo's from ice cube, dr.dre, yo yo, mc breed, kam, and public enemy-and even that can't save this cd from flunking."
5,ONE OF THE BEST!,"I saw this movie in the theater when I was 4 years old in Las Vegas! One week later my mom got me my first mini bike, and I've been an avid off road motorcycle enthusiast since then. I finally found this movie in a video store in 1981 (10 years after first seeing it), if you like motorcycles, and the 70s, this movie is the best. Bruce Brown does a killer job putting this masterpiece together. Flattracker Mert Lawlwill, Malcolm smith, Steve Mcqueen, and a host of other stars, and future stars appear. I have viewed this movie at least once a year, since I found it in the store in 1981! Also very humorous!"
5,Terrific Movie,"My husband is an avid motorcyclist and loves this movie. I would highly recommend it to anyone who likes motorcross,motorcycles, etc.."
4,CD,Ordered for my husband for Christmas. He enjoyed and has watched several times. He has recommended the to several friends.
5,Why you should buy this DVD,"If you love beautiful photography, Steve Mc Queen or motorcycles, this is a great DVD. I have had,( and loved), a copy of this film on VHS for many years, but compared to this DVD, it is pathetic. The DVD is so sharp and clear that it is breathtaking. There are minute indications in the DVD that the film stock was starting to deteriorate, thank God it was rescued for posterity by DVD. It includes great features on Steve McQueen and the making of the film. Bruce Brown's beautiful photography alone makes this a work of art worth owning. Buying this DVD is the best way that you can vote for the preservation of great films! Do it!"
4,Too Damn Funny!,"Scott Adams obviously sold his soul to the Devil, because no one can hit the ball out of the park every time! It's impossible.Thanks for making the sacrifice, Scott."
4,Nice mini metal lathe,I just go one os these and I love it. Couple of things I found to be unexpected: (1) It's made in China I had expected to be made in USa since it's grizzly. (2) The threading gears are made of plastic along with some of the gears in the head housing. Other than that it run smooth and quiet.
3,There are better pocket diapers available,"These diapers are soft and cozy and easy to use, but in my experience with them they don't hold runny poos very well-- and I mean big explosions that require a full change of clothing--aughhhh! They are not sufficiently absorbent either. I found the BumGenius pocket diapers to be by far supierior. The one size of BumGenius is well...genuis! At $18 a diaper I sure appreciate the fact that I don't have to keep buying new sizes like I did with the Happy Heinys. I have not once had a big poopy explosion which amazes me and my daughter can get through the night without a wet bottom in the morning with the BuMGenius diapers. Not the case with the Happy Heinys."
4,Good Pocket Diaper,"A really good pocket diaper for many reasons. They are soft, easy to use and I have had no problems with leaks or diaper rashes. My only compliant is that they seem to run small in sizes. I bought the size small for my son which was suppose to fit babies 8-16 pds, however, the diaper was too tight when he was only 11 pds (he was also within the height and waist limits). The fuzzi bunz I believe are better because they have adjustable snaps as your baby grows. The bumgenius one-size diaper is also wonderful at growing with your baby to save money."
4,Good alternative to the powder,"I always make sure to have styptic on hand when I trim my Lab's nails ""just in case"". I found these to be easy to use, and more convenient/less messy than the typical styptic powder I've used in the past. A little pricey, otherwise would have been 5 stars."
4,Good Game,"This game is allot like Zelda, just better. Its hard, but fun. It has very good graphics. One of the best games I have played.( tip) Buy this Game!!!!! ( tip) Dont assemble gaffers buggy until you beat theis dungeon."
3,Its... ok,"I thought the game was ok, however, i don't find it half as interesting as zelda in zelda each board was a different environment with new wepon or tool usful to the game but in dark cloud ever board set up exactly the same way and way to long the georama thing was cool however but thats all you get in the dungeons nothing really interesting a new sword once in a while or some item required to move on but not usually something that makes it ""exciting"" so if you like to repeat the same things over and over again this game is good didn't really keep my attention though"
3,Great game but...,"Dark Cloud is a game about Toan who is given the power to stop evil. The story was great, sound was great but their are no voiceovers, and gameplay was great. The only thing that is a little frustrating/annoying is the level up system for the weapons. I think it takes kind of long to level the weapons up. Level 5 should have made the leveling up system better. Still Dark Cloud should not be missed."
2,Not that impressed,"I got this game because it reminded me of Zelda. It is similar, but is hard to navigate all around. Not my favorite game."
4,Creative,"This is one of the best games i have played for the PS2 yet. You play as a hero who goes around the world and rebuilds it. Alot of the reviews compare it to Zelda on the nintendo 64. They are both very complete different games. The fighting style and the 3rd person are similar, but, the weapon develpment and and character develpment are very different. I like how you can use 6 characters as you wish.The only downfall is when you are in the dungens that the background doesnt change. Overall, it is a game worth playing. Orignal in many different ways."
5,The best of the Best,"This game is amazing is so cool. It have lots of weapons, items, gems, magical stones, and others.It's de best of the best.You have to try play this game.I have this and I can tell to you that it's the best of the best.It's de best RPG game of all.You have to play this game.It's very cool!..."
3,"Interesting at first, but then it gets very repetitive",Initially this game seemed to have it all. It is a mix of Zelda style gaming with a Final Fantasy like weapon system and with the city planning of Sim City. ... There is only extremely minor variation in the graphics and gameplay from dungeon to dungeon - something which is unacceptable in modern games.So it boils down to this: If you like Zelda style fighting in a Diablo like game with a few SimCity elements then this game is for you - but if you like RPGs with more depth or with more varied gameplay I recommend that you stay clear of this one.
3,Well it's nice but just not enough,"The game starts out allright, but overtime it becomes just... the same. The Dungeons make 90% of the gamplay, 6 dungeaons 20 floors each, all with the same monsters, events and stuff. Its tediuos and addictive (in a bad way) to upgrade weapons, monsters are simply silly, and the bosses are the easiest ever (except La Saia), the game could be nice, but its just zelda with annoying monsters and inane plot in general."
2,"Some fun to be had, but gets old fast","One general word of advice. Whenever you see a game that says ""randomly generated dungeons"".........run. A few high profile failures have tried this, (Anarchy Online anyone?). The problem with random dungeons is just that........the whole game seems random. There is no sense of fighting thru the underlings, to get to the ""boss"". Yes there is a boss at the end of every dungeon, but there is no progression that's immersive.The graphics are also very ""cutesy"". This is a good game for children under 12 or so, would be a nice first ""RPG"" for someone, but for serious gamers it becomes very boring very quickly.By far the most ""fun"" to be had in this game is goofing around arranging the towns you have to put back together. Unfortunately, most of your time is spent in random dungeons, fighting random mobs, and it all begins to look the same VERY quickly.Rental only"
3,Zelda redone,"I think that this game is very compariable to Zelda for the N64. If you like Zelda, then you will probably like this game. However, this game gets very boring pretty quick. You will find yourself doing what seems like the same thing over, and over."
3,Not the right CD!,"I thought I was purchasing the CD that had versions one and two of ""Tonight is the Night"". It is not. This CD only has version one, which is not long enough."
5,great in depth comnmentary,this a great in depth commentary.broken down to the smallest detail. includes word translation & compares several versions & their differances.a must have for serious bible study.
3,"Pretty good, overall","The music on this CD is pretty cool, but I knock it down half a star because I could do without ""Renegade Survivor"". Just listening to the sample of it I know it doesn't belong with the other songs and takes away the mood that the others bring. I take away another star and a half because they didn't include the songs ""Take me Higher"", ""Leave You Far Behind"", and ""We Are"", which were all major songs played in the trailers and previews and would of blended very well with the other songs and the setting for the movie."
4,Great Soundtrack... Spectacular Movie,"I've seen this movie twice already, and will probably see it a few more times in theaters - the visuals are stunning, the plot is great, the characters good, the jokes sparse but excellent (thanks to writer Joss Whedon.) After about two scenes of the movie, you want to buy the soundtrack - and thankfully, the best songs are actually on it. There's *none* of the all-too-common loading up the soundtracks with songs not actually in the movie. Its an excellent blend of techno and alternative, a very modern sound. I especially like Cosmic Castaway, My Turn To Fly, Over My Head, and Like Lovers."
3,Just one question,"I remember the TV ads for Titan A.E. They played the song ""Higher"" from the band Creed. But I saw the movie in theaters and looked up the soundtrack and no song by Creed! Why? It's almost like false advertising, I was expecting to hear that Creed song in the movie and have it come with the CD soundtrack. I can't remember enough of the soundtrack to rate it, but I did find it fitting for the movie overall. So 3 stars."
3,good but....,"The songs are great, nothing to submit... Ok, there are different styles but that makes this soundtrack a mixture that fits quite well. There is only one great BUT! If you are looking for the real score , instrumental songs, like the great introduction music (cliché but nice) or the romantic piano music/violin score as Cale is wounded, you won't find it... personally I think this is another commercial album... never the less it still has some class...A shame the soundtrack doesn't contain score!"
4,Beautiful and Sturdy,"Im a bit larger on the bottom than the top so the thong was tight at the hips, I just pull it up higher and it doesnt even get noticed. The fabric is heavy weight and very sturdy. The hook and eye closure takes a bit of effort to put on but worth it. Looks great with thigh highs!"
4,Power Rock'n Roll!,"""Mary Jean"" was power-rocker and rock'n roll reviver Marshall Crenshaw's fourth album. It was originally released in 1987, same year as the La Bamba movie, in which Crenshaw played the part of Buddy Holly and gave a terrific version of ""Crying, Waiting, Hoping"". In fact, this was the song that made me notice Crenshaw.""Mary Jean"" is probably one of Crenshaw's most consistent albums, featuring 9 Crenshaw originals and a cover of Peter Case's ""Steel Strings"".Most tracks are upbeats catchy power-pop songs; and the opening track ""This is Easy"" sets the right mood from the beginning. A string of similar great tracks like ""Calling Out For Love"", ""Somebody Crying"", ""Mary Jean"" and ""Till that Moment"" follows. Only ""A Hundred Dollars"" and""Wild Abandon"" disappoint.The only ballad ""They Will Never Know"" closes a fine album. Besides being a prolific songwriter, Crenshaw is a fine singer and guitarist, and there is usually a lot to enjoy on his albums."
4,watch,Solid good looking Casio with multiple alarms and a data bank to keep critical phone numbers at another place besides your cell phone.
1,so so,Functional but too fragile.On the second day got two big scratches all of a sudden. I guess that's due to a cheap plastic glass. would recommend not to buy them.
4,casio watch,The watch keeps good time. The only fault I can find is that you can only move the hands forward when setting the time. So if the watch is a little fast and you want to move it back just a minute you have to go all the way around the 12 hours and stop the hands in exactly the right place.
3,Very good bargain watch,"This is a very good modest sized bargain mens watch. It is easy to adjust the time forward, but it is very tedious and time consuming to adjust the analog time backwards. After using a promo code it was about the price of two replacement watch batteries."
1,Blue-ish purple?????,this produdt is purple there is no blue-ish about it. the style is great the color discription is wrong. i ordered it thinking blue-ish ok it looks more blue then purple in the description. I looked at it when i got home.... purple not even deep purple. I'm returning it!!!!!!!!
2,plastic had already pulled apart,I must have received the lemon in the line. The plastic area where the band connects to the face is very soft. Within days the plastic had already pulled apart and the band ripped free. Not sure why such a key area of the watch and the most stressed part of it would be plastic. Not recommended.
3,Works well but tastes nasty... :/,"I've been trying to put on about 7 to 10 pounds because I do feel a bit to skinny (don't judge me... lol) So, looking around I really was looking for something inexpensive. This product does work! I've been taking it daily but not the recommended intake b/c i think 1500 calories extra a day is crazy! I've already put on 6 pounds and I'm happy. The reason I gave it 3 stars is because it tastes so nasty!! I wish it had no flavor. When I drink it, I literally have to hold my breath and just chug it down. I have tried mixing it into a shake with fruits and it has helped a bit but i could still taste that strong vanilla flavor. Also, the after taste is a bit sandy. Well, I guess we have to sacrifice in order to accomplish our goals!"
5,Great Interpretive Singer,"Johnny Rivers is one of the few musician of 60's who doesn't change music style with time. Through out his musical career, he always maintains bluesy singing style. Johnny refused to jump in the psychedelic rock band wagon of the late 60's. ""I never wanted to jump on that (progressive) stuff because I didn't need to and (for me) it wasn't honest,"" he says, ""I would have fallen on my ass just like the rest of them who tried it and didn't do it honestly.""Many of Johnny River hits are the re-make of another hits.. Johnny took the original songs like Smokey Robinson's ""Track of My Tears"" and Four Top's ""Baby I need Your Loving"", and sang them with his original style. The result is that Track of My Tears and ""Baby, I need Your loving"" are more uptempo and more bluesy. Secret Agent Man is the most played song on Radio this day and is my most favorite song. Poor Side of Town became Johnny's number hit."
3,"Julie Brown, the white one..","This album came off as I kind of expected it to. I always liked Julie Brown in her comedies, and on her own tv show for a bit, and this reflects her kind of humor. Alot of it is fairly funny, like the title track, ""Girl Fight Tonight"", and ""I Like 'em Big And Stupid"". All rather silly. But there's also a few tracks that make a legitimate try at pop music. They sound VERY 80's now, and do recall early Madonna, but the songs are decent and lightweight fun. My only big complaint is the absence of ""'Cause I'm A Blonde"", from the ""Earth Girls Are Easy"" movie. That's THE Julie Brown song as far as I'm concerned. Still, this is a good find."
2,Pile of you know what...not worth the money,"We expected something that is to be a workbench to be more sturdy than this. Very flimsy. My boys, age 2&4, played with the ""power tools"" for a bit after getting it, but that was about it. One of the power tools, I forget which, never even worked from day 1, even after replacing batteries twice.Don't waste your money."
2,Italian for Dummies,"As I wrote before, we received all the items we ordered and were pleased with the quality. However, the CD that accompanied ITALIAN FOR DUMMIES was broken into 3 pieces. For us - leaving for Italy in 3 weeks - we felt it would be very beneficial to have the audio function also. You were unable to find a new disc and you were very quick to respond and credit my account for the $5.00. 'Just an unfortunate accident, I guess. I will continue to order from Amazon."
1,disappointing,"After reading the great reviews of this book, I was eager to start learning Italian in anticipation of a trip to Italy. What a disappointment this book is. In the introduction of this book it says, ""You don't want to have to memorize long lists of vocabulary words or a bunch of boring grammar rules."" It then goes on to do just that: lists and rules to memorize from pages 9 to 40. It is indeed boring. If you have to buy this book for some reason, skip these pages, and go back after you've read Chapter 3: Bongiorno! Meeting and Greeting."
3,Italian for Dummies,"Very informative book into the Italian language.. Don't expect to be fluent in the language by the end, but you will have a general knowledge of the meaning of many phrases. Also this book is excellent for the person who wants to know some grammar rules and would like to have some knowledge of how the words are pronounced. Definately worth the time and money."
2,Italian not learned,We were going to Italy in several months and wanted to pick up on some helpful words before going. This product did not help at all. First of all it was boring to listen to and secondly I got nothing out of it. I would not recommend this product.
5,Role players fantasy,This was a great book. I read it several times the first week I got it. The world of role playing comes alive and interesting in this book. The characters were highly developed and the setting and events were wonderful.
4,Nice to have,"Was so excited to have dimmible LED lighting under my counter. The switch is nice. Nightlight in it. Really like it. On the lowest setting, my LED's still flicker a bit, and we have them set up correctly. Not sure why, but I like this switch."
3,Poor instructions,"The product is nice, but the installation instructions are so poorly written. I understand that everyone is not an Electrician, but this is not rocket science either."
1,High failure rate,"I have 4 of these switches in my house installed 4 years ago. They are great when they work but apparently are not built to last. In that period of time we have had 2 of the 4 switches fail in that they no longer dim, but simply go from dark to full light. For the price, I'm very disappointed in the product. Lutron customer service was not willing to simply send me a new switch based on my word that the switch had failed. They wanted me to have an electrician verify the problem. I ended up buying a new switch for the first one that failed and haven't replaced the second one yet. Buyer beware."
4,good music,It is a rare experience when a person can hear a voice as good as Gary Morris. I used to have an album by him that wore out listening to .It was only recently that I decided to replace that one and search for others. I'm really glad I did. Thank you.
4,Can't Stop Listening,"A must-have for any Amy fan... Except for the first two songs (similar to The Collection, which started with two new ones), all the charting songs are here. Every song on this CD received radio airplay (and the Billboard Chart positions are noted), making this a true greatest-hits CD. There are MANY songs from Amy's past CDs which are incredible, but since they weren't ""hits"", they aren't included here. I find the whole CD to be very listenable, even though the music is spanning almost 20 years! I think the obvious changes in music style/production are fun to take notice of.The new songs are good too -- ""Water"" especially shines. The only thing I would change is that I think the songs should have been in reverse chronological order, as in The Collection. It feels strange to listen to the new songs, then jump back to 1986 and work back to the present. But that's just a minor detail... overall, I great CD with a lot of variety, inspiration, and fun."
3,GOOD FOR ME single remix,"Where is the GOOD FOR ME single mix (i.e. you like to dance or the good for you mix)? As usual, nothing is EVER complete."
5,A Great Way To Catch Up,"While I am a big Goo Goo Dolls fan I havent spent a lot of time listening to Jed or the original release. These are CD's, that while I own them, are not my kind of sound. This CD, EOAC, pulls it all together and just gives the listener a taste of where the Goo Goo Dolls came from as well as where they are at now. They have since released Gutterflower, which may not have done as well on the charts at Dizzy Up The Girl, but EOAC is important to have to understand Gutterflower. This is an excellent compiliation of some of the bands best work that did not make it to the radio. You will LOVE this CD!!"
3,Very Bad Packing For Shipping,"The packing material was very inadequate for the weight and fragile nature of the clips/sleeves. Fully half the sleeves were broken into multiple pieces. Had I wanted them broken, I could have bought them at the store and come home and dropped the box on the garage floor. Working with sleeve pieces always increases jamming in the staple gun. Nevertheless, a good price and prompt delivery."
4,A good transition,"This was Yolanda Joe's attempt at the mystery genre under the name of Ardella Garland. I would say she did a good job at the transition. Looking back, Yolanda Joe's last book, THis Just In was a preview of what was to come. The City of Chicago is the setting. The city is in the midst of gang violence. After a drive by shooting, reporter Georgia Barnett is at the scene. She interviews a young child who can give a description of the shooter. A few days later, the child disappears. Georgia works with the police, media and family to get the child returned before it is too lateBeing a reporter is half of being at the right place at the right time, and having the right connections. For this story, Georgia has these opportunities. She also has the interest of the Det. Doug which helps her out a lot.Ms (Joe) Garland, did a good job in keeping the reader in suspense. The story had the same humor as her other works. The action was steady, exciting and at some parts funny. Very realistic."
3,flyboy71,good product for half the price.item arrived promptly and operated as described when installed.i would use it again if needed.
2,rally,"This is a trip down memory lane. I was one of the soldiers stationed at the base this book was based on. Story is not the same as actual events, but I just had to have this so my friends and family know ""what I did in the Army""."
5,"""NO"" can be a good thing!","This is one book I wish I had read a couple of years ago when I made a decision to go from healthcare management into sales. It makes common sense that not everyone is going to want your service or product, no matter how well you overcome their objections. I developed a totally different mindset after studying the ""secrets"" presented in Mr. Fuhrman's book."
2,Thus Always to Tyrants,The clip I heard on NPR induced me to buy the CD. Scott Miller takes himself too seriously. His performances are generally overwrought. He would be much more entertaining if he'd lighten up a little and try to at least sound like he's having fun.
3,Not as pictured,"Works well so far, but the cone shaped nut is made of plastic, not the shiny metal pictured in the ad. My experience has been that metal items far outlast plastic junk. For well over $20, there is absolutely no reason for plastic!"
4,Tight,"This album is sick. Plain and simple. If your looking for an album with good lyrics don't get this because all lil jon does is scream, but if you want an album that gets your blood pumping and gets you charged up, this is it. Best songs: all of them except ""diamonds"" and ""nothing on."""
1,Whut!?!?,"How this guy got a reputation as a ""genius"" producer is beyond me. All I hear is annoying and incredibly basic beats and keyboard loops that I could come up with in about 5 minutes. Let's not even go into the ""rapping."" Crunk is awful, I don't care if it's meant to be club music, this crap sounds worse to me when I'm drunk. Like EPMD said, ""I'm strictly hip hop."" You can keep your garbage crunk music. I'll stick to the real stuff."
5,This CD is....well CRUNK!,"I must say its very impressive when you can jam to every song on one CD and not feel let down. Lil Jon and the Eastside Boyz, are master's of this. If you listen to this CD and don't once nod your head...you might want to get it examined. This is the south at it's best, this is a def. club banger, and i would recommend this CD for bumping it in the car. Its one that you just have to move to the beats and the quick spit lyrics. This is a great CD for those customed to freesyle and downsouth style."
2,A Baaaaaaaaaaaad Album .,"There 's not much I can say about this bad album . Get Low is a great song but the rest of the CD is terrible . I like Lil' Jon , I think he's a cool guy . If you like this type of music I recommend Ying Yang Twins ."
5,Fisrt Solo Album,"Paul Simon debut album is thirty-four minutes and three seconds and was released on January 14, 1972. Paul Simon reached #4 on the U.S. Billboard 200 Album charts and since gone Platinum. This album was his first solo album and it came about two years later after the break up of Simon and Garfunkel. Some of the songs have that Simon and Garfunkel quality while others deal with his divorce. Three of the songs charted from the album. I am giving Paul Simon an AAA+++ on his first solo album.Side 1Mother and Child Reunion#4 U.S. Billboard Hot 100#4 U.S. Billboard Easy ListeningDuncan#58 U.S. Billboard Hot 100#30 U.S. Billboard Easy ListeningEverything Put Together Falls ApartRun That Body DownB Side to DuncanArmistice DaySide 2Me and Julio Down by the Schoolyard#22 U.S. Billboard Hot 100#6 U.S. Billboard Easy ListeningPeace Like a RiverPapa HoboHobo's BluesParanoia BluesB Side to Mother and Child ReunionCongratulationsB Side to Me and Julio Down by the Schoolyard"
4,<3,"this cd has recently really grew on me. i listen to it over and over.i have had it for awhile, but just never really listened to it, for whatever reason, and just popped it in about 2 weeks ago, and havent really taken it out.:)i like armistice day, and peace like a river. maybe my 2 favorites...i dont know. really, i enjoy every song. one really good thing about this cd is every song sounds fairly different...which i always enjoy.:)quickly becoming one of my favorites by paul."
5,the better half of simon and garfunkle,this is paul simons first album since leaveing simon and garfunkle i love this album its some of the best guitar work ive ever heard this guy is as good as dylan think dylan but more acomplished guitar arrangements smoother vocals and more texture this i prefer to dylan because simon is a creative musician and a very good one the quitar work on this album is unmatched for its kind a few songs took a few listens for me to get into for example amastice day witch is now one of my favorotes the its diverse as well from the blusey peace like a river to the happy and up beat mother and child reunion.this is the best album by any of the worlds best song writers and one that genrally goes unnoticed witch is a shame because this is paul simons best work check it out if you like music
3,Madonna songs,"There are 4 Madonna songs on this album - the rest is unimportant. If you are a Madonna fun the album is a must. ""The Look of Love"" is a beautiful song and then we have 2 hits: WTG and CAC. The mterial reflects the true-blue sound from the album released a year earlier"
1,Waste of money,"An ambitious title, but totally irrelevant to both saving and Zen. Mainly a negative treatise about the United States and capitalism. Sorry I wasted my money on it. I would have given it no stars but couldn't!"
3,On Tuesdays They Played Mah Jongg,"As a Mah Jongg player I got a kick out of this book............it is sad, laugh out loud funny and quirky..........."
1,Worst book I ever finished,"How on earth did this book ever get published? The writing was atrocious. The characters were boring--not one of them a reader could feel even a smidgen of empathy with. The plot was non existant. I can't think of a single thing positive to say about this book. It was obvious the author had taken his screen play with stage directions and copied it almost word-for-word and passed it off as a novel. The only even dimly bright spot was the ending when the author admitted it was the worst piece of s--- he had ever written. Usually when I encounter a bad book, I just cast it aside. For some inexplicable reason with this one, I finished it. For that I would like to kick myself. I gave this book one star only because there were no negatives available."
4,"Go, Johnny, Go","I have always like Johnny Rivers. Great singer - No. Great stage presence -NoI just like the guy. Wasn't expecting too much from this album, but was pleasantly surprised - very good!"
2,MISSED CHRISTMAS,"This was a Christmas present and Amazon failed to deliver on-time, making it a late Christmas present. Guess the movies are okay - they are classics so I am not reviewing the movies - only Amazon's (lack of) service on this one."
3,Too Loud!!,"My 5 year old thinks this toy is great. BUT, it is very loud, making an obnoxious whining noise as soon as you turn it on! Within 2 days, the cap on top, designed to hold the discs in place, had broken off, and so the discs all spill out while he's running around with it. It's very frustrating for him to constantly have to stop to reload. O.k., I guess, for outdoors play, but it's too loud for in the house."
3,"Not bad, but not great","There are two main problems in this book. First, this is one of those books where a single sentance really damages the credibility of the writer. The author talked about the people getting tired from all the slogans, from the economic situation and from the blood the revolution has spilled. All this is fine (you can agree or not agree, thats not the point here) until the writer says that six million people attended the funeral which was one of the largest in history. Here the only explanation the author could come up with was that in the end, what was done was done and people forgived Khoemini. I think the reader deserves a better explanation than this. The second problem is that you cant be sure if its a biography, or a book about the political events in 20th century Iran. Other than that it was quite interesting to read. There are many facts in the book and the author has done quite alot of research."
1,Do NOT buy if you are looking for a 2008 update!,"Extremely disappointed! Although the book itself is very good, Amazon incorrectly labels this as an April 2008 update. It is not! It is from 2003, and a lot has changed in five years. And I couldn't have found this out from the publisher's web site either, since they don't even list a date for their books... Ticked off and trying to decide whether or not to return it for a refund."
4,Good story,"After reading this book along with the other two, to complete the trilogy, I have become a big fan of Hunter Morgan's work. This novel was well thought out and very mysterious. Worth reading."
4,The songs were great!!,The songs were great!! Just cant stop listening and worshipping the LORD!JESUS is the best!
3,It takes forever and heats up!,"DO not recommend this charger, stick with the original SONY one, this aftermarket replacement does not work well. After placing my ""almost empty"" battery in the charger I waited the time it instructs and no good, the charge was not complete, replaced with another battery I had and same result; so I decided to leave it an extra half hour and started overheating even though it showed finished.I tried my old BC-V615 when I got home and presto! battery charged properly and no overheating. For a moment I thought my batteries were just bad. I was wrong its the charger. As they say:"" you get what you pay for.I purchased this charger becasue the picture shown made it look compact to fit in my already overstuff camera case, but is the same size as the SONY original.By the way, I tried different batteries on my Mavica too and only Duracell and Sony batteries seem to work and last properly.My grain of sand. Happy picture taking..!"
2,"Blah Blah Blah Blah....too much talk, not enough action","This book is putting me to sleep! I bought it a few days ago and have spent that ENTIRE time reading. I'm more of a visual learner, usually the TYI21D books are very hands-on. So far, this one is harshly hands-off! How can I be expected to remember all this information? I need examples, not just charts. It doesn't look like its going to get any better later in the text, I've scanned-through the book several times wondering when this terribly detailed nonsense will end and from what I've seen, it continues through the entire book. -yawn-"
1,Terrible book,"The different authors write different chapters defining some things differently.The material is outdated, you'll constantly have to update their junk to make it work.Way too verbose and bouncing back and forth within an individual chapter (just try those two early BMP/CMP chapters).It's just not worth $1.Use the sun tutorials for a much better and much much clearer start."
2,Wasn't in Black White,"To my dismay, the poster came in full color, was very disappointed and expected purchased the poster because it was in Black and White.."
3,Useful reference work,"Certain plants are more accessible and safer alternatives to synthetic drugs and can be very powerful curative agents. This book is not an instruction manual but serves as an interpretation of herbal medicine based on the practical experience of expert medical herbalists. The A - Z list includes herbs (described in terms of their functional effects on the body), symptoms and diseases, therapeutic classifications and other miscellaneous entries. Herbal infusions and decoctions for home use are described and other techniques are briefly defined. The book is a valuable reference work but not the best work on the subject currently on the market."
5,A Gem,"Jill Jones's distinct voice can be heard on Prince songs like ""1999"", ""Lady Cab Driver"", ""Hello"" and ""It's Gonna Be A Beautiful Night"". Fortunately, her self-titled Paisley Park album is a gem. It's a short album, but every song is great. My favorite is ""Violet Blue"". Too bad that this album (and other rare Paisley Park gems)isn't more readily available for purchase. Glad I was able to find it."
5,A trip to America,"Children enjoy this story about two young immigrants coming to America. A young girl tells how she and brother cross the ocean by ship alone, to meet their parents who already live in New York. She describes the long journey's ups and downs, and also the stop at Ellis Island for a medical check-up. Finally they are reunited with their parents, who now live in a ""palace!"" It's great for kids just learning about immigrants, or maybe about how your family came to America. The pictures are wistful and dreamy. Your 7-9 year old will like it!"
4,Many Great Songs,The Mercy Seat is a band fronted by Gordon Gano of the Violent Femmes. The Mercy Seat was a side project while the Femmes took a break in the late '80's. It is a collection of spiritual songs.
5,"Good information, lovely photographs, attractive layout","As someone who's just getting into gardening, I was pleasantly surprised to see that this book includes sections on topics like soil evaluation and composting in addition to the expected chapters on choosing, planting, and pruning roses. Another nice aspect is that the fertilization and pest control sections emphasize organic methods, but also list others if you need them. The layout is also attractive and makes the book a pleasure to read."
5,Tell me what to eat if I have Diabetes,This book was very helpfull to me. To have Beginning stages of Diabetes you are just lost for what to eat. This Book tell what and how to eat!
3,"It gets better when you re-read, re-read it.","I skimmed through the book when I first received it, and was not impressed. But on re-reading and re-re-reading, and paying more attention to what the author has to say, I did find it helpful. I am newly diagnosed with diabetes and have much to learn. This book includes a lot of practical suggestions. I'm still re-re-reading, dog-earing sections for later reference."
5,touching movie,MMA fans will love this movie but moms will also too. It has drama and passion at the same time. Not only for the young generation. This movie is for everyone.
5,Good Movie!,"Warrior is a great movie! Good action, minimum foul language. I was pleasantly surprised at how good this movie was."
1,Entire Movie in a Spoiler Cover,"Who chose the still for the thumbnail? Don't bother watching the movie to find out who wins. You know it!Great acting, great action, but any sense of drama is gone."
4,Warrior Film 2011 4.0 Stars,"I cannot believe how much I enjoyed this film; I thought the acting was top-notch (especially from Nick Nolte). I also found the training scenes were also very well done.I also have to say that I was not expecting this film to be as good as it was. I was interested in this film from start to finish and the emotional climax was very well done indeed. I strongly recommend this film to all those that would like to enjoy a film that is action packed, well acted and well made."
2,Cheesy,I can't really believe the reviews on here... am I the only one that actually watches mma? This movie is so unbelievable it kills it. Weight classes are all off and who can actually take 30 direct hits to the face and still fight? Yet to see a good and believable mma movie.
5,A Must See,"A wonderful film, not just for UFC/fight fans. This movie reaches out to a much larger audience than what you may expect. Definitely worth five stars."
