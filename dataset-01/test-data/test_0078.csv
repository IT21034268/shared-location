2,Not Serious At All,"This isn't a serious scientific book. It's not even close. Yes, it's billed as that with the science tackles the afterlife subtitle but you probably need to think about Penn and Teller's Showtime series. It's more along those lines. It's not supposed to be serious but it's not funny either. So I'm not sure where Mary Roach wanted to go with this book. It's awful. She uses Google as her sources but yet she attempts to tackle a serious subject and speaks to serious people. Not sure. Just didn't enjoy this book. I doubt I try another one of her books even though friends have said that Stiff is better. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone."
2,boring useless information,"Basically it was boring, useless information that never really seemed to come to a point."
3,Not as good as Stiff,"If you've read much about ""ghost hunting,"" or the paranormal, you'll learn very little from this book. While I found Mary Roach's book Stiff very interesting and funny, this book was basically a repeat of stuff I'd read elsewhere, and after a while, her sense of humor (mostly puns) gets very, very old."
5,Spook/Science tackles the Afterlife--all you want to know and more!,"If you are at all interested in the human body,it's functions and how wonderful a ""machine"" it really is.....this is a wonderful reading. What happens to the body when life stops and the blood is still? How can we learn more about how to protect it and prolong it's usefulness? All this and more in this book. I definitely recommend it to all people to read and learn."
5,Another Great Book from one of my favorite writers,This is a great read. I love Mary Roach's mix of information and humor. Fits right in with the rest of her great books. I can not wait for the next.
4,Very good depiction of the novel,"The DVD of A lesson Before Dying is well done and well acted, particularly Don Cheadle and Cissely Tyson. My students read the book and looked forward to seeing the movie, which they enjoyed. We had fun comparing and contrasting the similarities and differences between the book and the film. The film stays true to the novel."
3,ok,This movie was ok but i did not like all the foul language in it I will be throwing mine in the trash.
5,dont start your opening repertoire without reading this book,"this is an excellent book to be read before planning to build a serious opening repertoire , it will save you lot of time and efforts and normal pittfalls .....he is not suggesting any opening to use but teaches you what should you consider when planning your repertoire .....an advice dont start buying openings books before reading this book , its a great help....it answered all the questions and more that passes by any serious intermediate player in studying opening theory, in fact i didnt find any book that delivers even the same topics under one ambrella."
2,Put this album near the bottom of your Jethro Tull list,"I understand why Ian Anderson wanted to experiment with the new sounds of the 1980s. But, why did he have to include many of the annoying features of that musical period? Melody is sacrificed in favor of passionless keyboards and other gadgets.On the bright side: ""European Legacy"" is an excellent song. So, monster Jethro Tull fans might want the CD for that reason alone. ""Later, That Same Evening"" is almost as good. The rest of the songs have marginal entertainment value and are a bit hard on the ears. If you're new to Tull, don't buy this album first. Otherwise you might be scared away before you discover their good music."
3,Promising first novel,"Gridlinked is a slow starter but ends up a fast burn in the second half. I was close to putting the book down after 100 or so pages, as the story line was confusing & the writing somewhat uneven. Once the real action started, I was hooked, & stayed hooked until the final page. Good complex story, solid treatment of good/bad guys and bad/good guys. Fans of cyber thrillers will enjoy this book, & I look forward to watching Mr. Asher develop as a writer."
2,"Sloppy, cliche","Quite terrible for a scifi novel, even allowing for this being Mr Asher's first major work. It's chock-full of terrible, overused cliches, wooden characters with no personal development whatsoever, childish asides, stilted dialogue straight out of bad action B-movies and a generic scifi universe that never explains all the plot holes and discrepancies it contains.If you're a fan of intelligent, well-written scifi, stay away from this one."
4,"Fast paced carnage, lacks character depth","""It's not only humans who know how to hate."" A tantalizing hook for this Gridlinked novel... yet not much was hammered out regarding the difference between how a human hates or an AI hates. AI characters weren't fully explored as being human or even being sentient. However, the concepts in tech and originality were big pluses, always providing a highlight in between the battles, gore and destruction (three more big pluses!). The only character development seemed to be orbiting around Ian, while the rest of the cast were left merely to interact with him."
5,Revive Our Hearts,"Brokenness: The Heart God Revives is a wonderful study. We are using it in our small group Sunday School class, and as we prepared our hearts for revival, it was and is, a perfect study. If you are serious about Spiritual depth, and learning about pride that you may be unaware of, this is so good."
5,Learn everything you need to know about networking!,"Andrea Nierenberg brings a winning combination of lucid insight and a warm and generous heart to the subject of networking, a subject that most people find daunting, or worse. She understands the universal wish that we all have to connect with others, and she explains to the reader how to develop the skills necessary to build a supportive community of business relationships based on profoundly human values. She is a gifted teacher, conveying her message in a friendly, down-to-earth caring manner through analysis, anecdotes, short checklists, and plenty of wit. She understands all of the challenges, and systematically and brilliantly tells you everything you need to know to become a successful networker -- and to enjoy the experience!"
1,GARBAGE ...,"This is one of the worst albums I have heard in along time!!! I can't believe the unoriginality of the lyrics... its one line that repeats over and over and makes absolutely no sense at all. ""Kill the machine"" and stupid lyrics like that rampage this horrible album causing it to SUCK. They are just a coal chamber/korn wannabe, and they are not going to make it anywhere expect with people that don't know anything about music. If you like this album, than you have ALOT to learn about music, try buying stabbing westward or staind."
3,A PRETTY GOOD CD BUT NOT AS GOOD AS KORN,i've been listening to a lot of these little demo songs that they have here. they all sound the same but atleast they sound good. i think that i would get this cd cuz i like the guitar riffs in it. But MATT STEVENS i do not think that this album is better than ne KORN album. KORN IS NUMBER ONE.
2,For Completists,"This collection features two alternate versions of BRAZIL--both of which truly stink when compared to the original. One is edited to death by the film's infamously possessive producer, the other liberally enlarged (and dramatically weakened) by the director. Together, the two ""cuts"" make a terrific case against any one person having total control of their creative output.This collection also features a so-so documentary called THE BATTLE OF BRAZIL, about the public war waged between the director and the producer over the film's content--frankly, THE HAMSTER FACTOR (a brief documentary on the 12 MONKEYS DVD) was much a more insightful look at Gilliam's unique brand of stubborn genius than what's featured here.So even if you're a real big Gilliam fan, I'd just rent this one--it's useful to see all of this stuff, but it doesn't garner repeat viewings."
2,Brazil,"I have heard and read many good reviews of this movie, so when I sat down to finally watch it I expected a true masterpiece. The bigging of the movie truly grabed my attention, with its great theme and brilliant visuals. The movie remains good for another half hour with its funny look on a demented society, although the movie is far from a comedy. The next 1.5 hours are pretty much a let down. The political satires virtualy stop the the movies plot becomes so unclear that it becomes almost umbearable to watch. The only exeption to this would be the last 3 minutes of the movie which are masterfuly filmed, and is definatly worth watching. I consider myself a fan of off-beat movies that are very though-provoking, but Brazil fell below my expectations and made virtually no impact on me. there are a few parts of the movie worth watch but it doesnt make up for the other 75% that suck. In conclusion i find the movie overlong and at times unintentionaly silly."
2,Imaginative but that's not enough,"It's interesting how the Amazon reviewers fall into two very opposite camps, those who found this movie boring and those who give it five stars.I like ""arty"" films. Take a look at Aguirre The Wrath of God. It's wonderful.I have to tell you the simple truth, though. Brazil was much too long for me, and in some places I was just saying ""This is stupid"". I have to agree with the naysayers on this one.It's not enough to be imaginative and different. It's not enough to satirize our bureaucratic society. There are just too many faults here. The film is all over the place, and not that funny. It disappointed me.Let me steer you to a far superior comedy that is also highly respected by arty people. Try ""Closely Watched Trains"". Try ""Amelie"". Try ""Discreet Charm of the Bourgeouisie"". All three are far superior to Brazil. Check them out. Try ""The Lady Eve"". It kills this one."
2,Ehm...what the hell?!,"This is the sort of movie where if you go ""nah, didn't really like it"" people will just say that you didn't get it as if you're some sort of moron, who's incapable of comprehending a movie with a more complex plot than Star Wars. The movie does have a couple of upsides (that's why I gave it 2 instead of 1 star) namely Michael Palin and the stunning visuals. The rest is dismal at best. The movie is way too long and I felt no connection to the characters whatsoever. I also don't think that Gilliam is some sort of visionary for creating this movie...does the # ""1984"" ring a bell? Now that was a visionary book while this is a halfhearted attempt to copy it (along with some personal additions here and there).And don't be fooled by people telling you that it's a black comedy either. There are some midly amusing scenes in it, most of them involving Michael Palin in one way or another, but even those don't deserve much more than a casual smile."
2,not imaginative,"despite the fact that this film maybe thinks it's very imaginative, it strikes me as being much more about the ""look"". i really think it substitutes an aesthetic (which is cool, but only gets you so far) for genuine imagination, and runs out of inventiveness before it comes up with anything interesting in the way of characters, relationships, plot developments, changes in tone, novel cultural critique...what's good about the movie is simply some of the cool images (black typewriters and magnifying glasses etc.)"
2,so much promise...,"After watching the first 45 minutes of this movie I thought I was in for a truly wonderful treat, after all, I had heard all the hype so I figured I'd probably love it. But unfortunately, this movie totally falls apart. It becomes very boring and drags on for hours. I know Brazil fans out there will disregard my statements but really, this film could have accomplished more with at least 30 minutes less movie. There are both standout performances and standout scenes, but by the end of the movie I had lost all emotional connection with the characters and the story. Honestly this movie just turned into a big mess. You want an amazing story in the spirit of 1984, read ""Darkness at Noon."" What a disapointment. De Nero was great though..."
1,"If you're a pseudo-intellectual, buy it!","I enjoyed The Time Bandits and The Adventures of Baron Munchausen, but this one just doesn't cut the mustard. Folks, in order to be enjoyable, symbolism has to have meaning. This film doesn't. Don't waste your money."
2,Not Into It...,"I saw most of this movie years ago, and I just tried to watch it entire to see the first part I missed. Quit half-way through.This movie has fantastic art direction, and is filled with small bits of good comedy, but it basically has one or two jokes told over and over again: jibes at the petty status-seeking of bureacratic society; satire of technological utopianism, as shown by the constantly screwing up duct systems, robots, anachronistic typing machines, etc.The story is a simple and tiresome one about a poor guy who dreams of a girl, both from the opposite sides of the bureacratic tracks, etc...The ""romantic"" aspect is hackneyed, and of course, it's way too long.Better to read 1984, Zamayatin's We, Brave New World than to watch this film. They're more clever, more disturbing, and more funny."
1,"Nominated for ""Most Overrated Cult Film""","I am sorry, I have seen this movie three times, including recently in it's ""restored glory"" (mostly because I have been subjected to pressure from friends who keep claiming this is one of the greatest films ever made). I can see and appriciate a uniquiness in the visuals and story that this film has, but it completely fails to grip me. This movie seems to be too long, too redundant/monotonous, to bill this as a De Niro movie is a false advertising, and Pryce is more compelling selling luxury cars. Maybe because I am a huge Monty Python and Robert De Niro fan I have never been able to look at this movie properly. Sorry, but this movie just doesn't cut it for me."
2,"Funny, yet Depressing","*Not the Criterion Collection version*Whenever one takes a look into the future of our society, it's never one of peaches and cream, but always a dystopia, filled with dark shadows, oppressive government, and gargantuan buildings. Brazil is no exception. Sure, many of the visuals created by Monty Python alum Terry Gilliam are striking and quite creative. The story produces many laughs yet never quite hits its mark. Its not that its a bad movie, but one much too busy and dark for its own good. The plot twists and turns until its last depressing slump, complete with the main character humming that oh so famous song."
4,This film is not for everyone,"I saw this film when it was first released in the U.S. and it left me feeling stuned. The visuals were overwhelming, the plot was dark and depressing and the satire cut like a razor. Exactly my kind of movie! In order for one to truly enjoy this film one has to be able to identify with its main character of Sam Lowry and this is where, I think, the film succeeds with its many fans. Those who fail to appreciate this film are those who fail to understand Sam's posistion, his delima and his ultimate solution to dealing with the true horrors of the world in which he lives."
2,A negative trade-off,"This movie is loved by just about every art director I know. They loved it because it looks great. No argument there. No surprises either as Gilliam is art-based. But the price you pay for a visual feast is that the story is an indulgent, non-involving fantasy which just goes on forever. If you're into a fairy tale that uses more and more detail in an attempt to make itself real, and constantly rewards the eyes then it will all come together magically for you. Seems like a lot of reviewers feel like this. But for me, the trade-off between how the film looks versus pretty much everything else about it ends up in the negative. None of the performances stood out. It did not hold my interest. I could not watch this movie to the end after two attempts. Enough, already."
1,ARTHOUSE GARBAGE.,"Really this satirical take on Orwells 1984 is nothing more than a messy arthouse flick. I first saw this movie back in the 80s, my ex-brotherlinlwa was raving about it,to be honest I thought it wasa load of crap back.Acouple of weeks ago, I picked it up for ten bucks at movie warehouse, and thought I would give it another go, well I really struggled to stay awake when I watched it last sunday, and my verdict is the same as it was back in the 80s, ""a load of old toss"". Don't waste your money."
5,One of a kind movie,"More than a cult film. Different layers and levels of story, talent and directions make this a wonderful film, and the collection is unique"
5,"Great DVD, just not the release advertised...","The packaging for this version was mislabled: The American release version of this movie is 131 minutes, but this one is not -- it is the 142 minute Director's cut. If you want the American cut, you'll have to buy the video."
4,One Wild Ride,"When a plastic-surgery crazed friend of the main-character's mother bumps into him, the woman, confined to a wheelchair and wrapped in bandages, utters, ""My complication had a little complication,"" and all viewers in-tune with Terry Gilliam's screwball masterpiece fall out of their seats laughing. Gilliam's film is absolutely bizzare, managing to be both bleak and vibrant, hilarious and grim, clausterphobic and escapist. Don't miss it or its snappy musical score."
1,Very disappointed!,"I bought this book because so many people on the internet spoke so highly of it. Sorry, but I don't agree. It's terrible. All of the information concerning his methods could have been swept up and put in one single chapter. The rest of the book is one continuous rant about the modern world, it's methods, and it's way of thinking. In large I agree with his rants but I don't need a whole book, chapter after chapter, covering the same thing again and again. This is not the book to pick up if you are looking for new ideas and experiences that you can apply to your farm or garden."
1,"Great music, but not ""lost"". Stolen.","The music on these albums has been legitimately issued by Lennie Tristano's label, Jazz Records. One is entitled, ""Live at Birdland"" and the other is ""Wow"".""Jazz Factory"", a slippery outfit, obviously stole the music from these CDs and issued them as ""Lost Tapes"".""Stolen"" is more like it.Incidentally, the sound quality is inferior to the genuine release on Jazz Records."
1,Be prepared to spend a LOT more money,"This product allows the child to only access a very small percentage of what displays in the game as being available. For about 80% of it, when they click to do that part of the game, it gives them a message that their parents need to become members for them to have access to the additional games. Membership is $7.99 per month or $149 one time fee! I don't recommend this at all, because I think it is bait and switch. My daughter is extremely upset because we cannot buy the membership, so she can't play most of the game. She has really enjoyed the parts available to her, but the company should make it CLEAR on the packaging that a membership subscription for an additional fee is required in order to access most of the game."
3,poorly done - but kept her attention,our daughter (age 8) watched it. it kept her attention and she liked it. Not a classic - but it is just another pumped out Christmas story. Never would have bothered if it weren't on Amazon Prime. Very poorly animated.
2,lame toy-not fun at all,"after seeing numerous commercials my 2 1/2 year old asked for this toy which she got as a present - she loves playing with the care bear figures but don't waste your money on this toy -its not even that its not worth the money, it just isn't fun - the castle tops fall off, the care bears don't stay on the little pegs, the sound effects are totally lame, the swing falls off, there's really no room on it to play - my daughter was sooo excited when she unwrapped this gift but has had no interest in it since as she's discovered all its faultswe do have wish bear's little house which is a little better - it has a couple chairs to sit in, a little stove, a little fridge - still not great but better built, more fun and more worth the money"
2,dissapointment,i bought this for my daughter who loves care bears. the tops of the castle do not stay on and the swing and rainbow bridge do not work either. i believe this would be a waste of money. I was very unhappy with this purchase
5,What A Disappointment for Putting together,It was fun watching our daughters eyes lite up when she opened the package from Santa and she saw Care Bears from him. The down side is and or was the fact that the music does not comeout even after exchanging the item twice and tried twice with the batteries. Talk about a let down even with the rainbow and swing not staying. Letting a two and a half year old down........what a bum deal.
2,very disappointing,"I bought this for my daughter today and am very disappointed. I had exchanged a present she got double of for this as she wanted it. We were excited putting it together but that wore off very quick. The towers should snap in place, they don't. The bridge doesn't connect at all. You can't try it out because of the packaging in the store, TOO BAD, as I went to all the trouble of driving to the store, getting my daughter's hopes up, putting it together, and it was defective and wouldn't do a thing. No lights, no sounds, nothing!!! Now I have to make another trip to the store to try and return it-good thing I didn't rip the box. It is definitely not worth $40.00."
5,Care-A-Lot,"Cheery characters guide your little one through the magic and caring of care-a-lot, the care bear land. Have hours of fun with the kids, all for a cheap price!"
2,A lot of pink plastic and not a lot of fun,"My daughter desparately wanted this last Christmas and so it goes we ordered it as there was no local store who carried it. None of the castle ""tops"" lock into place so they keep falling off. The swing worked about 1 hour and has since found it's place laying on the floor next to the castle. The toy was played with approximately 4 times since last Christmas. My 3 year old (at the time) was not at all impressed. For the money, you would be better off getting ANYTHING from Melissa & Doug collection."
1,care a lot,There are a ton of pieces that keep falling off of this toy. I found it to be a hassle with my daughter constantly asking me to put something back together. Eventually the toy and all of its pieces got lost or thrown in the back of the closet.
1,New Scent - Awful!,"Beware! St. Ives has added a new scent to this product! Not only is it overpoweringly sweet, it also made my skin burn.I've used this product for twenty years, and it always treated my sensitive skin well. Now, it burns.St. Ives shouldn't be allowed to use the hypo-allergenic label on this product anymore."
4,Two great classical pieces with rap.,"I discovered Sweetbox on a compilation dance cd and picked up the album from the local library branch. I find that in addition to her hit ""Everything's gonna be alright"" that features great lyrics set to the Pachelbel Canon, the first track on the cd, ""Don't go away"", is just as good. Apparently the underlying classical music is taken from a Mahler symphony though I have not been able to verify this yet. The liner notes give credit to the symphony orchestras that perform and the choir but not to the name of the pieces from the repertoire from where they were taken. I enjoy classical music as much as pop and though I didn't like listening to the album the first time, it has grown on me. One drawback is that it is only 37:44 in length in just eleven tracks so you don't get much bang for the buck."
5,AWESOMELY AMAZING!!!,"Sweetbox is an awesome CD. I feel that it should be placed back in stores. It has a variety of style and some of the songs have an amazing meaning. ""Everything's Gonna Be Alright"" was a song that was played for me and kept me going when sometimes I felt like nothing more could go wrong. I'd buy this CD for my friends and family if I could find it. PUT IT BACK IN STORES!!!!"
5,Sprited and Spirtual,"Why have we not heard more from this artist? Some tracks on this album encouage reflection/meditation; while others can be used while you do your Sat.morning exercises or housecleaning. The spirits are definetly speaking through her, especially the female deities. I would recommend this to anyone who understands the powerful influence that music with positive energy can exert; and the difference it can make in your day at any given time."
5,Hanson....You still got it!,"This album is fantastic!!! it has songs you know and lonve from Middle of Nowhere This Time Around and Underneath, along with some new songs. When I saw the tracks, i was thinking that some songs like ""Where's the Love"" was going to be the same as Live From Albertane. Boy was I wrong. The songs you've heard on Live From Albertane are in a different arrangement, which makes it more interesting because you dont know what the next song will be like. Thank you Hanson for another amazing live album!"
5,AWESOME!,"As a huge fan of Hanson, I honestly didn't expect a cd this great! This cd features covers of songs by U2 and Radiohead! This is one of those cd's you turn on and find it difficult to turn off! It's AMAZING! Everyone needs to give it a chance and just listen to the excellant vocal performance!"
2,oh boys,A bit boring and they really need to spend more money on production. Their last album (Shout) had good songs but let down by por production.
3,A bit deceiving and not what we expected,"We thought it would be fun and a nice change to the game to have the questions on DVD. From the description on the box, you get the idea that all the questions come from the DVD, but they do not. The DVD is used to win a piece for each category and to win the game. The rest of the questions are still on cards like all the other games. Just disappointed that it wasn't what we expected.The questions are good, not as difficult as some versions. Which may be more fun for those people who are not die hard trivia people that don't enjoy the most obscure questions. The tokens are nice and unusual.So if you are a more general knowledge person or not a hard core trivia you may like this game. I would give it a higher rating, except it bills itself to be an interactive DVD game and that is just a small part of it and gets to be a bit tedious after a while."
3,Its a good game!,"When i bought this game i was excitied to play. Right away my family started playing the game and we had a great time, but after playing it for so long it got kind of boring! If you use the DVD it will repeate questions after playing it more than once. We have used the cards but it is more fun with the DVD! I would recomend it if you looking for something to keep people busy!"
5,A lot of fun to play with friends...,A see a lot of the reviews down this game for being boring or not as good as other trivial pursuit products. I am not the typical trivial pursuit player and found the game to be a lot of fun. If your in your 20's or 30's it will bring back a lot of hilarious memories and create a lot of converstaion when playing with friends.I don't play this game all the time but its perfect for a weekend night when you have friends over for dinner and want something to do after dinner with out going out and spending a bunch of money!
1,Skip the DVD edition....,"I thought this game would be fun and interesting for us pop culture trivia geeks but it was stupid! Firstly, you can't skip around on the DVD so you are stuck in one place the entire time. Secondly, the questions are less than should be expected. I would go for the good ole fashion board game before investing in this."
4,Only fun for the true pop culture fan...,"I bought this game for my family for Christmas. I am a pop culture freak and thought it would be fun. Well, it was fun for me, but no one else enjoyed it.It's supposed to be for ages 8 and up. I don't know very many 8 year olds that would enjoy this game. It is a long game and the questions are way too hard for children. My 12 year old only knew the answers to two or three questions. My husband didn't know very many of the answers and got frustrated, too, as did the other people playing.I'd say it's a good game for older teens and young adults...that's about it. It definitely wasn't worth the money spent."
2,"VERY disappointing ""romance""","Reader follows dressmaker Louise from lowly beginnings to the high-fashion world of Charles Worth, from love with a dashing soldier (who treats her dishonorably) to an abusive marriage of convenience and finally ""love"" with a friend (although this is reduced to the single paragraph on the last page, when she realizes her dear friend has always been waiting for her). Extremely disappointing to someone looking for romance, and that's how this novel was marketed. Gets two stars only for its interesting portrayal of the 19th century fashion industry. The story itself is only worth one"
4,not as good as the series but..,"The Sex and the City movie is heart-warming and an enjoyable watch, however, it is no where near as good as the series. The women have magically all turned into billionaires, the cheesy scenes have taken over the comic realness that the series provided and the movie is a little too predictable. That being said, I still love the four women, even if the movies a bit of a let down."
5,Sex & The City The Movie,If you were a fan of the series you have to see The Movie! It has a great ending!
3,Sex and the City movie,"Good story about the bond of friendship. It will make you laugh out loud, cry bigs tears and the range of all emotions. Definitely a movie for adults only."
4,Great Deal,"This DVD is in great condition, the only thing I didn't care for is that it doesn't have a case - just a plastic sleeve. Other than that, I am very pleased with this purchase."
3,Extravagant chick flick.,This movie is what you would expect if you have watched an episode of Sex and the City. Full of love and heartbreak between the 4 women.
2,Digital copy NO LONGER WORKS!!!!!,"Buyers beware that the digital copy of the movie is no longer good. I popped the disc into my computer, entered the code, and received a message that said the offer for the digital copy had expired!!! Seriously?!?! Then maybe they shouldn't advertise that it includes a digital copy!!! So, half of this product no longer exists. Kind of lame, if you ask me."
4,Excellent continuation,"I really liked this movie. Of course, I was a big fan of the TV series. Fashion is the fifth great friend here--and was nothing to sneeze at in the series. It was terrific to spend time with these women and although it's a fairly long movie, it held my attention. There were a couple of flaws in it for me. I just don't think Mr. Big/John would have handled the church wedding like he did. That seemed considerably out of character--way too crass and heavy handed. The other flaw had to do with Stanford, Carrie's beloved male best friend. He seemed to serve no other purpose in the movie other than the writer/director letting us know he was still alive--and we could barely tell that. He deserved a better showing. Overall though, terrific entertainment."
2,Huh?,"Not sure what I didn't like the most - the bathroom ""humor"" - what was that all about? Huh?? or the Jennifer Hudson addition - could have lost that entire character. So Carrie has these treasured friends but finds ""the answer"" about love with somebody she has known for a minute? And then gives her this tacky handbag as a measure of her self worth . . . oh please! I would rather watched more of Mario Cantone and Willie Garson - they were in the movie mere seconds. This could have been done SO much better and really I expected it to be from SJP."
5,"A Must add to your ""BFF"" collection",I waited to watch the ladies because I heard so many mixed reviews of the movie. So one day with nothing to do and a lot of time on my hands I watched..and I couldnt understand how one person was dissappointed by this movie. It answered every question that we always wanted to know once the series ended and I fell back in love with every character just like it was a Sunday night in front of the t.v. 4 years ago. If you are a die hard S&TC fan you will melt at the way the BOND remains the same between the ladies after all of thier life changes..true the addition of Carries assistant threw it off a little.. but a little extra never hurt anyone. I am glad I watched it was well worth the wait!
4,Love the girls,"Love, Love, Love the girls, and Mr Big, yum....It was very good, better than I thought it would be when (doing a follow up to such a great show). Have friends that really liked it too, and they didn't watch the TV show."
4,Interesting material for Lennon fans,"Twenty-one songs from ""The John Lennon Anthology"" are showcased here, with alternate tracks and rough demos from ""Plastic Ono Band"", ""Imagine"", ""Some Time In New York City"", ""Walls And Bridges"", ""Rock 'n Roll"", ""Double Fantasy"", and ""Milk And Honey"". One highlight is ""Real Love"", which the other three Beatles completed in 1995, as well as some home recordings. Some interesting material, some ho-hum, but definitely worth a look for Lennon fans."
3,Great while it lasted,Bought this in Feb. it died in Dec. Seems the switch broke. I will try to fix myself because it is out of warranty. It was great while it lasted. Might have to get one every year but that defeats the purpose of saving change.
4,Works fine and fast,"It's true that sometimes at the top of the column a coin or two fall into the bowl below, but that's very easy to remedy. As long as you have the cylinder full (flat even to the top), it's the right amount for the coin sleeves. I counted the first time to be sure. And it's sure faster than doing it by hand, as I used to."
4,Saved me hours!,"I had a hard time selecting a coin sorter because so many of them seem to have poor reviews. This one had mostly good reviews so I took a chance. I'm really glad I bought it! It's simple to use and not very noisy (has a ticking sound but it is supposed to). I rolled about $300 worth of coins throughout the day. The only problems I had came up when I had too many of the same coin (pennies) at one time. It got a little backed up and then pennies started coming out of the nickel and dime slots. Also, since this machine doesn't have a digital counter, I had to count up the first roll of each kind to figure out when I had the right amount. The coins line up with the rims of the tubes, but coins vary so it isn't always accurate. Beyond that, very happy with it."
3,It works well enough for my needs...,I've only used this product once since I got it. It works just fine. It takes more time to change out the coin wrappers than anything. I would say I'm satisfied with the purchase.
2,Didn't work,"The unit seems very cheaply made for 60.00. It sounds like it's going to break as soon as it starts sorting and doesn't seem to handle very many coins at once. The coins got stuck a lot, went into wrong places, and worst of all didn't put the correct amounts in the slots. I will be returning it and hope to find a better one. The nice part is that it is not battery operated which is what I am looking for."
2,Too oily,I'm not sure how this rec'd so many good reviews. This product is way too oily for anything but maybe Oak furniture. It seems to me that Oak (or equiv) would absorb the oil. For me...it was a huge waste of money.
5,Great idea for the mirrors. Highly durable.,"I had those relocators for four years now. And they are still rust free, paint is still as new although I do wheel in extreme weather conditions."
4,Good content and informative,I enjoyed reading and studying some of these projects. Each one of Norm's books have something new and interesting to learn about. My only question is when will there be a next issue? The TV projects are great and it would be nice to review the available plans and be able to order them on the net.
4,Spalding Inflating Needles,"Although the product ordered was delivered promptly, and in appropriate packaging, it was not what I needed. I was unaware that you needed a different size needle for Yoga Balls. My bad."
2,"Product fine, PRICE ABSURD","The writeup for this pack of air needles for balls doesn't mention how many needles ... If you incorrectly assume you're getting several like I did, you will be surprised. There are 2 needles in the pack.Same pack sells locally for 97 cents ... Suggest buying locally for these. If I sound a little irritated ... I am. Hate paying more than I had to."
5,Iowa Fan,"This cd is great if you haven't bought it yet you should. Alice in Chains is one of my favorite bands, and to have another gruop with the grundge sound is just way cool. It's got a good mix of styles and it doesn't sound like anything else out there right now."
4,Still wondering why this group was not bigger than they were,"What a great album! The band is post grunge, but definitely sounds as if they came out of Seattle along with Alice in Chains. The singer even sounds like Layne Staley, not to mention the grunge guitars. Very good album I highly recommend this album, if you are looking for a post Grunge band to listen too."
5,Hot Club Song!,"My Favorite song on this album is of course Let Me Clear My Throat, my friends and i recently visited Cancun, Mexico and this song was one of the most popular club songs that was played over there, i love this song, it just gives u this special kinda energy to just get to the dance floor immediately and do your thang, this song is off the rip..4 real"
1,discontinued,"This product (Energizing) has been discontinued by Nivea. They have replaced it with ""Revitalizing"" Face Scrub. I much prefer the Energizing. I ordered this but was sent the Revitalizing instead. I asked for a refund label and mailing address, which the supplier said they would provide, but have not heard back (three weeks now)."
5,"For Tommy Emmanuel, thanks Amazon","Far more than is healthy, my fingers head for Amazon Music>Tommy Emmanuel, and after a couple of days, I am listening to another TE CD . . . and smiling. Don't even remember how I learned about Mr. Emmanuel, but 5 or 6 of his CDs are now in my collection, and he has the same positive effect on everyone who hears them. Lovely technique, interpretation and selections!"
5,Wonderful DVD,George is a very funny guy. you will enjoy his DVD. Just listen to it and you will see why.
5,The closest thing I've found to a textile lover's Bible!,"After having perused several books on the individual topics of weaving, spinning and dyeing, it was a complete delight to discover this magnificent tome! Rachel Brown's well-illustrated presentation of these crafts is a godsend for the new ""fiberholic"" and an invaluable reference for the experienced weaver or spinner. The explanations are thorough and easily understood. A must-have"
3,Symphony of Praise,"Linda McKechnie's artistry is truly inspiring, so much so that I went to great lenghts, having found 'Worship in the Key of Life', to add more of her work to my collection. At last I found it via internet. What a disappointment when almost all the tracks on 'Symphony of Praise' Vol I & II were to be found also on the 'Worship' cd. Had this been made clear in the ads or on the 'Symphony' cd's I would not have bought these duplications.Linda's work and that of the orchestra remains entranching and stunning."
2,Antiquated,"While the illustrations by Alice and Martin Provensen are interesting, the actual nursery rhymes are so antiquated as to be meaningless to children. There are some classic rhymes, of course, e.g., ""Three blind mice,"" ""Hickory, Dickory,"" but many of the rhymes would hardly make sense to children outside of the United Kingdom. As other have also questioned, I'm not sure that continuing a tradition of singing of knife-wielding farm wives being cruel to rodents is one of our best traditions. For those who grew up with these nursery rhymes, this book will ensure that they continue to be enjoyable."
5,NonProfit Membership Toolkit,"This book gets my highest praise for putting a lot of valuable information into one easy to navigate source. My book is marked up with highlighter and sticky notes! Although I don't work for an ""environmental"" nonprofit, I found that the insight and experience easily translates into my field (long term care for the elderly). Very, very good. I highly recommend to all development/fundraising professionals and volunteers."
4,Cool is back,"What can I say? I picked this up, not knowing what to expect and was pleasantly surprised. The beat and killer poetry-reader like lyrics remind me of a much cooler time long ago, with a modern twist. I would like to find some more music featuring Billy Cote and Don Greene. I think they have a real knack for song writing. I look forward to more material."
3,One person's opinion,"This book was recommended by a friend. It was interesting, but not to my liking. I would say it is one person's opinion ( as is all history ).I would not recommend it to any of my friends, simply because I did not feel it was a compelling case."
5,Beautiful cd!,"This is the most beautiful cd I ever heard. Its perfect for the little ones and their parents. I have no children yet, but I will save this one especially for them."
5,more protection than I thought,"I was worried this would just be a backpack type case, but there is a hard layer under the fabric, so there is much more protection than a soft case would have. I still worry a bit about my son carrying it on the bus, but now it actually comes home so he can practice at home, so it's give and take!"
3,What a duet!,"Can anyone find fault with Joan Collins or Orson Wells? Too bad the same can't be said for this product. The video and audio quality are average, at best. Just about right for the quality of the dialog and acting."
2,"Would be okay, but broke...","When I first received the Ontel Products GOPMO2 Deluxe Gopher Pick Up and Reaching Tool Set, it worked fine, but over time it ""sprung"" the screws and the tips wore down. I am allergic to latex and I searched and found a US made product called EZ Reacher - Standard, with blue silicone tips. Found rave reviews at arcmate dot com. Please, check it out. I am ordering today..."
1,Flimsy folding joint,"If you want a strong tool this is NOT for you. The folding joint broke within 3 or 4 weeks under normal household use. The rubber cups easily pull off metal studs. There is no place to get repairs. While the Gopher is really cheap, I now need to buy another one because it only lasted a month! I found the original version of this product called the ArcMate EZ Reacher and it's guaranteed forever! The price is twice the Gopher but the durability and guarantee make it a better bargain. The Gopher product seems to be a cheap knock-off of the more durable ArcMate reachers."
2,Deluxe?,"I bought this as a gift for Christmas, and I'm almost embarassed to give it. I don't know how it can be called deluxe, when it's just thin pieces of aluminum that look like they will bend with use. Of course I can't try it out to see if it works, because it's a gift. And it's advertised as a 2-pack, buy one & get one free. Well, I only received one. I do hope it works..."
2,"Hard to keep handle locked. Breaks very easily. Seems like a good idea but insufficiently robust execution,","Hard to keep handle locked. Grasper mechanism Breaks very easily - suction cups break off. Seems like a good idea but insufficiently robust execution, Solid grabbers with magnets at end and with the operational tool made from a hinged hook attached to pull cord would be a better choice, e.g. Duromed aluminum reacher with magnetic tip"
1,NOT AS ADVFERTISED,"IT SAID I WAS BUYING DELUXE GOPHER , WHAT I GOT WAS A CHEAP NO NAME IMITATION WHICH WAS NO WAY AS STURDY AND STRONG AS THE REAL DELUXE GOPHER PICKUP TOOL.. I WENT TO AMAZON BECAUSE I TRUSTED YOUR SELLERS I LEARNED MY LESSON."
3,"Decent source of adavice, but not entirely on target","This book does a great job of offering a review of the process by which qualitative research is turned into a product. For example, it does a great job of stressing some of the key difficulties in this process, and how to overcome them. The book, however, then offers some advice that is beyond just writing qualitative research, but is applicable to any type of writing. This causes the book to ramble just a bit. So for all that advice, you are treat to some waste of space. Any way, this book is a so-so reference."
1,DANGEROUS!,"The rear wheels on this toy detach very easily, my daughter is 18 months and can pick up the toy by itself, causing the rear wheels to fall off. One time she tried to sit on it after the wheels fell off and almost fliped over, that God i was right next to her. As a parent I do not feel this is safe, and will make sure the next time we buy a product simillar to this that the wheels do not come off."
1,Sent different cover,"I purposely purchased from Grady because I wanted the 9985 cover. They sent the 7553 cover with vents over the shelves, which lets rain in on the starter and gas knobs and on the side burner. I could have gotten the 7553 for less money, but felt the 9985 was worth spending more. I tried to call them to see about getting the correct cover, and only the owner can handle Amazon sales and he won't be in until Monday. I am displeased with this transaction , and with Grady's."
4,I enjoyed using this product. It suited my ...,I enjoyed using this product. It suited my needs very well. I was using mousse and when I received this product I switched over. It does the job better. I like the fact that it's not heavy on my hair. I also like how easy it is to use. It has replaced my other styling products for good. I would recommend this product to friends and family.
4,This product did a good job keeping my ...,"This product did a good job keeping my extremely thick hair under control, especially after I had just washed it. Most of the other products I have used in the past controlled pretty well but left my hair looking wet all day or feeling very stiff. With the VO5, my hair stayed in place while looking like nothing was on it. I am very pleased with this product and will purchase it in the future."
5,Smooth cutting,"Easy to assemble, handles/grips stay on no prob when mowing. Adjusted cutting length out of box fine. Works, easy to use, happy with purchase."
1,Cant judge a book by its cover,"This book is cheesy, outdated, (1970's pictures) and absolutely misrepresents what it's all about. A great portion of the passages are dedicated to ""your brain damaged baby"", which is not menntioned anywhere on the front or back cover. Something is not quite right with this book and I cant quite place my finger on it."
4,"Sound Philosophy, Cumbersome Delivery","I really enjoyed reading Doman's books because they were my first exposure to infant education, including How to Teach Your Baby Math. However, I quickly got over the excitement when I realized exactly how much work it would entail for me as a parent trying to flash giant cards in three step equations. In my parental laziness, I hunted around online and found there are a few programs that offer Doman-Inspired teaching but with none of the bother in making homemade materials or fumbling with flashcards. My favorite is the BrillKids Little Reader and Little Math software that flashes words/dots Doman-style but also includes a variety of pictures, audio, and video. If you like Doman, you'll find this is a much more do-able, modern adaptation. Both of my kiddos were sight reading by 13 months and phonetically decoding by 19 months, you can see some footage here:[...] or download a Little Reader/Little Math trials from the BrillKids site with a 5% discount. [...]"
4,The Exorcist,"This movie is definitely not recommended for kids say, below 13 years of age? I thought my 11-year old will have fun watching it with me . . . I was wrong. I had to turn our player off after 15 minutes into the movie. But I really enjoyed watching it with adult guests."
5,"Exorcist is not ""The exorcist""","When I got my first SAG card I was in a film with Linda Blair. I wanted to watch ""The Exorcist"" for content and by a wonderful accident I got the the wrong movie.George C. Scott (God rest his soul) Is outstanding in this film.This film is directed, Acted, and Shot in a manor film directors should take a lesson from.The film is weird as the subject dictates but at no time did I find myself looking at my watch.The special effects are great and the photography is super.If you are on the fence BUY THIS FILM it is a masterpiece."
3,What's the Big Deal?,"Everyone touts this movie as being the ""Scariest Movie of All Time."" While I agree that there are some truly shocking and scary moments in the film, it simply isn't the scariest movie I've ever seen. To me, the film was more of an essay on faith, a drama that discussed powerful, controversial religious issues. Father Karris's journey from doubt to sacrifice in the film is breathtaking--but not frightening. Was I the only one that felt the dramatic impact of the film? The green puke was gross, the head-turning scene was revolutionary, and the crucifix, ""Let Jesus..."" scene was downright terrifying. But for me, the true beauty of the film is Father Karris and the victory of good over evil. You want to truly be terrified? Go watch ""Glitter."""
5,"Forget ""Citizen Kane"", The Exorcist is the best!","Gosh, this film is so good! I've honestly never seen a film so incredibly well-made before in my life! It stars Linda Blair, Ellen Burstyn, Jason Miller, Max Von Sydow and Lee J. Cobb. They all do an excellent job of portraying humans the way they'd probably act if a demonic possession did actually happen. Some say this film's boring, I say it's a roller coaster ride of a movie. It's a really wondrous, enchanting film that you can't help but become possessed by!"
4,The Horror That Is...,"The Exorcist - Possibly the only film ever made that terrifies you and moves you, all at once. A superb soundtrack, Mike Oldfield's Tubular Bells for a start, and a very powerful performance from the young Linda Blair as the demon-possessed Regan, and set of petrifying sequences...the head rotation, the crucifix masturbation and the final exorcism...gripping stuff."
5,True classic!,Theres not a lot of words to describe this horror classic except...Scary! Although it never actually scared me I hear so many reviews saying how bad it was.They have re-released THE EXORCIST now here in Britain(About time too) and it is one film that definately belongs on my video shelf.
3,Scariest Movie..,"Scariest movie yet Inaccurate and Offensive(antiCatholic-nasty scene) loosely based on a true story about a boy many years before. Lots of profanity and vomit, Yet yes it is very Creepy and Scary."
4,READ THIS REVIEW......A MUST FOR ALL!,"OH MY GOD! Watch this movie with a big blanket! I have abandoned my Christian beliefs after viewing this movie! I never saw the previous version of this horror-laden movie, and this is so frightening. Now I am so freaked! I often find myself staring in the mirror wondering when I will be possessed by an unscrupulous demon from below. I often stare long enough that I start to see my face slowly transform from my beautiful face to that of the demonic ghoul, John Ritter....although once I saw myself transform in to Gary Busey. Furthermore, I find myself acting out the viscous deeds that these men have carried out in films such as ""Problem Child 2"", starring Mr.John Ritter and ""Rookie of the Year"", starring Mr.Gary busey. Please use caution in viewing this DVD when it releases after Christmas (how convenient), but just see it once and judge for yourself."
2,Like a car wreak,"Fat too many people slow down for a car wreck. What is it that they want to see? Mangled bodies and blood? Here we have a young girl masturbating with a crucifix and shouting, ""F*** me! F*** me!"" to a priest. Now if that's your cup of tea, you'll love this movie. Great performances, excellent atmosphere, and technically proficient, but very sickening. After watching ""The Exorcist"" you may have a desire to take a shower to get clean again."
5,"Hey little girl, what are you doing with that cross?","Of all horror flicks made to date, this has to be one of the all time classics. The graphic horror scenes and profanity certainly don't make this a movie for the faint-of-heart, but it presents the full chilling effect of William Peter Blatty's novel. Linda Blair is precociously talented in her role of Reagan McNeill. There are so many scenes in this film that will be indelibly etched in the memories of anyone who watch it."
3,ok but not the scariest movie ever..lol,lol calm down folks after reading the reviews of this movie on here you would think that this movie was REALLY scary but when it comes down to it i didnt think it was scary at all.. really its just a physchological thriller.. the only parts of the movie that i felt were disturbing is when reagan first gets possesed other than that i thougth that the movie was entertaining but not scary.. i dont see what all the hype around it was though maybe it is because i watched it with so much expectations that i didnt think it was that scary but yeah it is still a entertaining movie to watch a little bit disturbing (not that much) but an ok horror flick
3,Over-blown classic.,"The Exorcist starring Ellen Burstyn and Linda Blair is considered the best horror film of all-time, I have to disagree. The Exorcist is scary but the language and bodily fluids are a bit much, it's like enough already! The acting is excellent but overall this movie doesn't live up to the hype, sorry."
5,Blu Ray is amazing and this IS the best horror movie ever made.,"This is one of my favorite movies, and the Blu Ray picture is gorgeous and it comes with both the 73 original release and the Director's cut. It is also loaded with great behind the scenes footage that teaches literally how the whole movie was made which is great for filmmajors like me. Not only that there are documentaries that are fascinating too. This is a must own Blu Ray."
4,Genuinely Creepy!,"I rented this DVD and watched it at home alone, and I was too freaked out to get up to go to the bathroom! Really. This has to be one of the most frightening films ever made, and the added scenes only made it scarier.For instance, I think the scariest scene was the ""spider walk"" scene, originally cut from the film, but added for this special edition version. I literally got goosebumps--I think that has to be one of the creepiest things I've ever seen.A must-see for anyone, whether you're a long-time fan, or a new viewer like me. My only complaint is that the movie tends to drag in several places. Other than that, it's an excellent film."
3,VHS Warning,"Great movie...great extras.My only beef with this thing was that all the extra crap was at the BEGINNING of the tape. Maybe I dunno how this kind of thing works, but it seems to me that should be at the end. It was REALLY aggravating to have to fastforward through all the interviews and stuff without knowing how much of it was on there. It's obviously not an issue with the DVD version, but I really think it would've been a better idea to put all the extras AFTER the movie.That is all."
5,4 1/2 Stars,"I like this movie a lot. It had some great scenes and a good story line. I reccomend watching this BEFORE reading the book (if you do plan on reading it) because then you can't tell what will come next, and it just comes out a whole lot scarier. And the book goes into more detail so you will still have more to look forward to.If you are athiest or don't believe in possesion this probably isn't the movie for you. But if you like any kind of monster flick you should like this. It was very unique, I hadn't seen a movie like this before.Remember though, just because a lot of other people say it is the scariest movie doesn't mean you will think it is. Even still, I would give it a shot. If you do end up liking it you will have found a great horror story, if you don't you will have something to make fun of later."
5,The best horror film of all time!,"William Friedkin winds a tale mischief with a tale of evil. When a normal 12-year-old girl begins a curious journey with a Quija board, strange things start to happen. From deaths related to the Macneil family, to strange phenomena occuring inside the little girls bedroom.... When released into theaters, this movie plagued peoples dreams FOREVER! USA Today nominated this movie the scariest ever made, and I have to agree with them!"
2,"slow and boring, therefore not scary...","This is one of those rare instances where I actually read the book before I saw the movie. Blatty's novel is plenty scary but it is especially great because its uncomplicated and not very long, so impatient hotheads such as myself can actually enjoy reading it. All of the scenes from the book are in the movie, but they're a lot weaker in comparison. My girlfriend told me it was really long, and I totally agree. just too many long streches. This is yet another horror movie that actually looks worse on dvd. The transfer is to crystal clear. These movies look so much better when there being shown in dark, murky, worn out TV transfers. I thought that part 3 was a lot scarier."
5,Not for the timid.,"This is hands down the most terrifing movie ever made. I rented The Exorcist from blockbuster with some friends and watched it at midnight. Needless to say, I didn't get any sleep at all. If this classic horror film doesn't scare you nothing will. I saw it once and that's going to be it for a while."
4,"Not very scary, but disturbing","I guess I don't understand why this movie was voted scariest film ever made, because it was not. The film contained odd scenes and things of freakish nature, but it was not terrifying. I will admit that it was disturbing at some places. A young girl possesed, well that in itself is disturbing, but if you are looking for a scare, don't look here. The movie was great though, a little less than I expected, but still it was good."
5,The scariest movie I have ever seen!,"The Excorcist was in a nutshell, the scariest movie I have ever seen, and probobly, the scariest movie ever made. It had none of the cut 'em up gore we see today, but more of a gothic horror. See this movie!!!!"
4,One of the great horror films ever.,"I remeber the first time I saw ""the Exorcist"". Boy did it scare me. This movie explores the darker side of what we are taught in church. It opened the door for many immitators. This is surely one of the most horrifying movies ever."
5,"As a little girl, I remember crying.","The first memory I have of this film is at my grandmother's as a little 7 year old girl and crying because I was so scared of the scary little girl I saw on The TV. Ever since then (when I finally had the stomach to watch it all the way through) I've been fascinated with this movie. Recently when I saw the updated film at the theatre, it moved me even more. As a 24 year old I didn't think it could scare me but after I bought the 25th anniversary edition and tried to watch it at home alone. I did actually have to turn it off and switch on all the lights. It's very hard to shock me but this movie does. I Love the adrenalin rush! The spider walk was chilling, but what freaked me was the opening of her mouth and the blood that gushed out. Gross, I loved it!"
1,Enormous Letdown,"I don't see what's so scary about this movie. Maybe it's because I'm an athiest that this doesn't scare me like I was assured it would. Everyone I know and countless reviews have said that this was the scariest movie ever, and I was really letdown when it was just a long, boring, and frankly silly Christian flick. I also read that it might offend you if it didn't scare you. This movie didn't bother me in any way, aside from making me sleepy. It was the same story with Rosemary's Baby, another big letdown for me. I almost don't want to see The Omen for fear of another dissappointment. Once again, I'm an athiest, so this might be scarier for a religous person. That's all I have to say about that."
5,This Is A film not to be missed so I have been told...,Never seen this Film yet. I want to see if it is as good as everyone makes out. Please Remember It could never happen to you.. Or COULD IT After all it did really happen to someone's Child for Real...
5,Classic Christmas Carols,"I wanted a CD that had what I regard to be the basic, classic Christmas carols. I searched Amazon and saw this CD and I liked the collection of carols. I ordered it and first played it for this Christmas season and was well pleased with this CD. It's a classic Christmas carol CD that has the Christian carols as well as other well known carols and they are sung beautifully by a full choir. The music is pleasing to the ear and it did help get me in the Christmas mood. Once again I want to state that Amazon did it's usual good job in getting the item to me in a timely manner. As always I used the free Super Saver shipping and had the item and the other items I ordered with it rather quickly. Good job."
5,great cd,"for some reason I kept misplacing this cd, so I had the case, but alas, no cd. I kept forgetting and would come across the case and...so I finally found the cd again. I remember this one was reviewed well on amg. it is great there are some amazing moments on this album. if you are into trance/house/dance, it is a must own. I am making my way into the other albums in the series, but this sets the bar pretty high, if you like melodic trance, you won't be disappointed."
2,You have to be a fan,"Sorry, but I guess I'm not so much. Bought this on recommendation of a friend. As I live near Nashville, you can imagine how popular Amy is. But I found her voice no better than average, a little on the thin side, and her renditions of these did not redeem it.Be forewarned: you've got to be a fan to really like this."
3,Fun but not as durable,This toy has been a blast but has not held up being durable like the other power rides our son has. He also hardly ever used the trailer because it was so hard to back it up with it on.
4,Crest of a Knave,"For a band that never seemed to hit its stride, this particular album stands out. There is a bit of a Cold War theme to many of the tracks and the others all have relavance. Other Tull recordings never seemed to get it together for an entire album, but Crest of a Knave hits the mark. Like just about every other Tull recording, this one received minimal air play but that cannot be an indictment of the quality. Ian Anderson seems to back off of his dictatorial leadership and let guitarist Martin Barre share the spotlight.If anyone has never given Jethro Tull a serious look (or listen), this album might be among the best opportunities to get a flaavor of what the band is capable of. Tull fans have already rang in with their endorsements of this effort. There is a good flow to the songs and they compliment each other in their placement on the disc."
4,Solid and very likable,"Great return to form by the Tull after the lacking Under Wraps. The atmosphere, the music are the reasons this one is worth buying. Budapest is a great composition along with others such as Steel Monkey. The whole package including the cover makes me smile. Thanks Tull!"
3,Nothing to do whatsoever with heavy metal,"Also: This album won a Grammy for ""Best Hard Rock/Metal Performance"", a larger category that subsumes both hard rock and heavy metal; it did not win for heavy metal."
4,Strange...,"After going electronic, Ian returns to his roots. Or does he? There are lots of drum machines on this album, out of neccesity. Plus, this hardly sounds like the Tull of old.Cut down to a trio of Ian, Martin, and Mr. Pegg, the band had to scale back a bit. So they came up with this album.There are very few really catchy songs on this album. That's not really what they're doing here. It's all atmosphere. I mean, it's not just atmospheric wisp; there are real melodies and good playing and themes. Other people have said it, and with good reason; it sounds similar to Dire Straits.Me, I love catchy songs. But these songs all set a mood, and the album is one of Tull's most interesting late period albums. Plus, Budapest is quite a great song. Steel Monkey is a bit lame, but the rest is pretty amazing, atmospheric, and just plain interesting."

1,Misrepresented for 2004 Toyota Highlander Limited,"Do not trust Amazon's ""Find Parts that fit your vehicle"" feature entirely. Although it claims that this filter would fit a 2004 Highlander, it actually is not true. The size is nowhere close to what would fit. Fortunately, I found it out before it was too late to return. Returned it immediately.It will be immensely helpful if they listed the OEM part number(s) under Product Specs for what this filter is supposed to replace."
5,Perfect fit for 2002 Camry,Drop-in fit for my 2002 Toyota Camry. Easily save fifty dollars by doing it yourself. Be sure the seal is on the correct side during install.
1,TOTAL CRAP,I got sucked in and bought two of these. Both got holes in them within 2 months and were useless. The holder and rolling devices are made of incredibly flimsy plastic. It's not even worth my time to express how cheap and worthless they are. Trust me and everyone else here who has already suffered!
1,Not what it's billed to be...,"If you want the Joe Schneiderman guide to buffing NYC, than this is it. If you want an in-depth primer for the department or city in general, this is not it. I thought this book would be more of a reference or handbook given the title, but it is not. Mr. Schneiderman gives a heart-felt, personal opinion of his favorite firehouses from a series of personal visits. Personally, I was expecting something different from a title like that and thought it was misleading."
1,Don't Bother,"I can't recommend this book to even the biggest New York or firefighting fans. It reads like elementary school book report except it's a lot longer and its possibly even more boring. Look past this title, there are several much better alternatives such as F.D.N.Y: The fire buff's handbook of the New York Fire Department, of which this seems to be a cheap and extremely inferior rip off of. In summary save your hard earned money your not gonna get anything out of this title."
1,What A Disaster,"While touring the fire houses in NYC with my five year old son, I took along the ""Buff's"" guide to New York City. Sadly, I would've had better luck leaving the guide at home. It was not a guide at all, just a description of a few fire houses. After this trip my son no longer has any interest in being a firefighter. The trip was totally embarrassing."
1,wrong shipment,"I ordered Americas Favorite Hymns Vol. 2.I received Americas Favorite Praise Choruses Vol. 2I returned the cassett, and haven't heard anything since. Ken"
5,very well done,"I really like this book it was very well written and had a lot of information about General Bufords early years that you never hear about. I always wondered what happened to Buford at Gettysburg after the 1st day now I know. Its a shame he never got the recognition he deservied till it was to late General Buford was one of the best that the north had.the book also gives some insight into how bad the army of the north was actually run in the civil war by wasting good commanders and soldiers. I highly reccomend this book to anyone intrested in the history of the civil war and its commanders their victorys and blunders ""and there was many blunders just putting politicians as commanders over real soldiers was the biggest in my opinion and this book shows me to be right"". Well done Mr.Longaccre I will be checking out more of your works."
5,Exceptional material on a man who left little information,"Longacre's book is a wonderful look at the life of Buford, his experiences, challenges and love. The pictures helped me to visualize the steely-eyed man who held the ground at Gettysburg. A truly wonderful edition to any Civil War collector's bookshelf."
3,Met Expectations,"I ordered this dvd for my daughter, who was assigned to watch one of several movies and analyze it for scientific accuracy. Red Planet is dated and technically inaccuarate, but that was the point of the assignment. So the product met the expectations under which it was purchased."
4,Much too underrated!,"I would agree with anyone who says this movie is not ""great"", but it definitely borders on ""very good"". The acting is NOT bad, it's just subtle, and I didn't get the impression that anyone here was just working for a paycheck. Although I have seen way too many movies that try to compensate for poor writing with great special effects (and fail miserably in the attempt), RED PLANET's script isn't that bad and the special effects DO make up for it, especially if you love robotics. I also love the whole feel of this movie; if you badly want to see humanity go to Mars, this movie will just get you revved up more! Val Kilmer and Terence Stamp are wonderful (as usual) and Carrie Anne Moss depicts just the right amount of angst considering that she's the captain (although just about anyone could have played that role). I was very glad to add this to my collection."
1,All flash and no substance,"Red Planet is a huge compilation of special effects and flat characters. Apparently, the world of sci-fi has been reduced to gadgetry, according to this director anyway. There are gadgets galore...from a dog-like robot to foil mapping devices to giant bouncy-ball space shuttles. The mother-ship is an overwhelming collage of lights and buttons that all seem to do nothing. The character development simply did not exist. There are several characters at the start of our story and frankly, no one even cares when they are picked off one by one. The on-board computer with its simulated voice has more depth than some of the main characters. The predictable plot dictates the survivors and the outcome of this virtually suspense-free movie. If you want to see some cool special effects and/or futuristic gadgets, then this is the movie for you. However, if your interested in an intelligent scienc-fiction movie with a point, then steer clear of this dog."
3,MAROONED AND MAUDLIN,"RED PLANET has some visually stunning effects, and that's about it. The plot is so contrived and incoherent, one wonders what the movie is all about. The bookend narration by Carrie Ann Moss sounds like something a high schooler would write in a creative writing class, and the performances are all average. Not one performance stands out, and that's a shame with such a great cast, although I've failed to see how Val Kilmer has even sustained a career. Benjamin Bratt is annoying; Terence Stamp is like Peter Cushing on Valium, and the usually impressive Simon Baker (TV's Guardian) is saddled with a thankless role as a ""traitor"" without any underlying premise.RED PLANET is ultimately a yawner. It seems like it takes forever to get to the movie's point, and the Martian bugs are neat, but what in the heck are they doing?Visual eye candy but a lightweight concoction otherwise."
4,I liked it!,"I won't add to the lengthy comments whichhave already been made. This is a moviethat is definitely worth seeing. I can seewhy it is compared to Pitch Black - though itis not as 'tight' a movie overall as Pitch Black.It is a fairly solid effort nonetheless.The acting is very good, the sets look great,and the story is passable. You could do a lotworse, and will probably find this a cool flickif really into sci-fi. nuff said"
1,I can only pull my brain out for so long!,"Mars needs writers! I just watched this technically pretty, but tragically stupid movie and I'm having trouble breathing. I can usually forgive an SF movie for a few bad spots of science, but this one has too many howlers to forgive. AGTP for the genetic code instead of AGTC, a gamma ray burst from the Sun, an unconvincing terraformed ecosystem that wouldn't be able to produce oxygen, but it did and so much more. The audience for this kind of movie isn't that stupid! Come on Hollywood, spend some flipping money on a writer with access to astronomy and biology books.If you liked the movie, then I suggest you read a book like Mars Crossing by Geoffrey A. Landis to see how this story can be done well!"
3,Decent Movie but not really anything new,"Sci-fi fans will enjoy as will Kilmer or Moss fans. This movie really is not much removed from Mission to Mars... Basically can we live on Mars? Ok while you astronauts are there, something may go wrong, oops it did, now save your lives, ok, I can't go on, you save yourselfs while I try to save your life by giving mine... oops something else is wrong, now we can't leave, oh wait, if we do this and this, we can live, YEAH. I enjoy sci-fi and I really like Kilmer's work, but this movie will not rank high by either standard. A truly predictable movie, no huge twists but I am glad I saw it. Not really a movie you go tell your friends about, but if you are a Kilmer or sci-fi fan, then by all means check it out."
3,No ofende,"Planeta vermelho tem grandes aspiraes. Esta talvez seja sua pior falha. O filme no é um monte de efeitos passados em grande velocidade a fim de segurar uma história idiota. Tem um argumento básico bem interessante que torna sua realizao medíocre bastante mais pecaminosa do que realmente é. Vale a pena ir ao cinema ver esta (para mim a primeira) abordagem do tema ""viabilizao técnica"" da formao de condies mínimas para a habitabilidade de um novo planeta. Uma cena hilariante vale o filme: a expedio morrendo devido ao fim do oxignio de seus trajes. No mais, a habitual ""licenciosidade poética"" de princípios científicos em um filme que - para quem gosta de cinema ou para quem gosta de sci-fi vale o ingresso. Claro que se voc quer ver tiros, naves guerreiras e espadas de sabre, no perca seu tempo. No alimente esperanas também de este ser um seminal ensaio estético-cultural da primeira década do milnio. O filme no tem o peso de um Alien ou Blade Runner mas é melhor que Matrix."
5,Simply Masterful,"If anyone needs to know how to write a comic-book novel, remain faithful to the spirit and mythology of the series and yet take make it solid enough for a text-based medium, this is it. I read this novel as a teenager (to the point where my only paperback copy now is coverless and taped together) and was enthralled by its depictions of Superman and his supporting cast. Jimmy Olsen, Lois Lane, Steve Lombard and *especially* Lex Luthor are painted with good humour and with a three-dimensionality they never truly achieved in the comics. Maggin takes the threads of Superman's history and the DC Universe, binding them together in a coherent narrative that gives us new insights into the psyche of the Man of Steel and his greatest foe. I cannot recommend this enough, and hope that someone brings it back into print one day."
1,Just doesn't work,"I purchased this item with high hopes of being able to open jars e.g. pickles, mayo even without my husband around. It does not help at all. It is hard to get it tightly around the lid and even if you manage to do so, it rarely enables me to open wide mouth jars.Save your money."
4,Great color - REALLY big Shaker set,Great color and I like the stainless steel tops - looks fab on my kitchen counter and matches my colors/appliances. In my opinion. they are too big to be very pratical to use except by the stove. They really are BIG. Pay attention to the dementions listed before you buy.
3,whoppers!!!,"These salt shakers are LARGE. You probably won't have to fill them up but twice a year!! They're nice to sit by the stove to use in cooking but not nice enough or sized to be put on the dinner table. Very functional however, and I use them daily."
3,Leaky Lids But Love the Product,"I love a set of extra large salt and pepper shakers for cooking. This set was exactly what I wanted. The tops screw off so you can fill them easily. The salt shaker is perfect for kosher or sea salt. The pepper shaker also does well with large-ground pepper. The only problem is that the salt shaker leaks. I honestly don't know how, but the salt leaks out of the threaded area of the lid. I'm too lazy to send it back but I don't think asking for a replacement would do any good anyway as I suspect that they are all this way. I believe it to be a design malfunction. Otherwise, I am very satisfied with the product and with the company's service. Everything I ordered arrived on time and in good order."
1,Great Look - Unuseable!,"These are big and beautiful but unfortunately the lids just spin and spin making them unuseable - if you want them purely for looks, then go for it. Otherwise, you could end up with much more salt and/or pepper on your food than you want! =)"
4,Nice leather yet a bit inconvenient to take out the phone,I used it for my treo 755p. Perfect match with it yet it's a little bit inconvenient to take it out when calls come in...
4,botan rare toy,botan is a rare toy. one of the nicest toys from if labs. This toy is fun because she looks just like botan from yu yu hakusho. She is not very educational but she is made to last many years. If you would like to purchase botan go to the yu yu hakusho series 2 link. Then click on these sellers. look under contents for botan. If botan is not there other yu yu hakusho rare toys are also there and they may get more in later
3,"The gel has """"light"""" hold, but didn't hold ...","The gel has """"light"""" hold, but didn't hold my hair very well at all. It also claims to """"tame frizzies"""". It didn't do this well for my naturally wavy hair either. However, the gel smells great and worked well at """"smoothing flyaways"""" when I applied it to my dry hair. I think it would work great on someone who has a straighter hairstyle who just wants to smooth out his or her hair and add a little shine. If you want your hair to stay in place, choose something with a stronger hold."
1,Meet Marcel Marceau,"The quality of the filming was so horrible that I could not use it in the classroom. Very grainy and quality of transfer to DVD so poorly done, that once projected, one could barely see the scenes. A total waste of time, energy and especially money! There has to be a better DVD of Marcel Marceau out there somewhere."
4,A must for anyone involved in astrology.,This book is an important addition to anyones library in regards to astrology. The author has researched her material very well and is a major contributor to the new knowledge astrologers need covering this area.
1,Overrated,"I purchased this book because it kept popping into my message box, so I thought it may be worth itGreat marketing Amazon because it is a load or crapola that wasn't worth the postage"
5,Perfect,"Eleanor Burns books are the easiest and best for quilters. Always has the most efficient way to make a block, any block."
2,Why No Explanation?,I had order my templates and quilt book 2 days and they have not shipped from the facility with No explanation of why the delay. I am not to happy about this. Will write another follow up later if I dont hear anything!
4,Brings back memories,"I loved the quilts included in this book and can hardly wait to make some of them. The vintage fabrics are my favorites, so soft looking and comfortable. Thanks Eleanor for another great book!"
1,Sucks!!,The light has a yellow bulb. VERY hard to see when you are playing the game. Casts more a a shadow than any light.NEVER use it. Waste of money!!
5,Loved it!,"This is one of my favorite soap making books! The recipes are great! Although I've never done any of the hand milled ones, since I'd had trouble doing that with other recipes. The recipes make great hard bars of soap! Highly recommended!"
1,Party Tyme Hot Hits,Was listed under Karaoke and it was not! My daughter was extremely disappointed as was I for that was what I thought I was buying....
5,Great jacket!,"Sweatshirt-jacket arrived on time and looks great! Like the color- lt. grey. Cozy and warm- what I wanted! Thanks, Linda"
3,Alright for the price and had the color I was looking for,"I Got this hoody mainly for the color I look everywhere for a gold hoodie both in stores and on line finally finding one here, it's ok a little thinner then most hoody I've had also I was glad I looked at the product reviews because they do run smaller in size then most you would buy. All and all I am Happy with it they had a wide aray of colors to choose from which again was my main reason to buy it and the price was good darn right cheap compared to a lot of other hoodies I've seen. So if some one ask me about it I would basicly say its more for mild spring and fall days and if you are thinking about buying one make sure you order at least one size larger then you need maybe even two sizes if you like a loose fit."
2,disappointed,"I got my nose pierced back in May, and found out that I have a sensitivity to medal, so when I found out that plastic works for me I ordered this, I'm sure that other customer's found this product comfortable, but for me I did not it was extremely hard to get in, from the picture I didn't realize that the top was metal I thought it was all plastic with a jewel on top. I tried it anyways thinking that okay the plastic will be inside and metal on the outside and bam...my nose had a reaction. So for those who have a metal sensitivity this is not the nose ring for you.I hope this review is helpful for those that love the look of a nose piercing, but cant do metal."
5,good buying,"i recomend this for kids under 5, my twins are 19 months and they haver great fun with all the song the movie brings, is very educative for them"
2,disappointed,"These ears are not as pointy as those in the picture. They would need some work to get them to stay on, especially on small ears, and make them look realistic. In order to keep the hat from covering them the hat tucked behind the ears pushes the ears out and they don't look real. Waste of a little bit of money."
2,Look Elsewhere...,"You may want to consider another brand of point and shoot 35mm film camera. We purchased this camera a little over a year ago, suddenly last week it would no longer load film. Being just beyond the 1 year warranty, we contacted Canon Service for information on repair. We were instructed to send the camera to them for evaluation. We received a phone call from them indicating the camera could not be repaired as they didn't have the parts. They couldn't even offer a replacement of the same camera. What they did offer was the 150U model for $88 with only a 6 month warranty. Based on the reviews here, it sounds like the 150 is not altogether great either. Up until the time the camera quit functioning it took good photos and was easy to use.I just think for $100 a camera should last more than 15 months and be serviceable. This just seems too much like planned obsolescence to me."
3,Passable,"I am a Chris Botti fan and despite this album continue to be. Recently saw him in person and thought he put on an excellent show. Dynamite female vocalist with the band. But this was one too many album of standards played in a pretty standard fashion. Good in it's own right, I suspect, but not much jazz to it. The dual disc actually has a couple of tunes that are not included in the regular CD, that are much more in the jazz idiom that I thought were quite good and I'd recommend. Just would have much rather had a whole album of those, rather than what was served up here.Chris, time to get back to where you came from."
2,Instrumental or not?,"I assumed that songs performed by Botti would be on the trumpet - which is what I was looking for. Great was my disappointment when songs like ""Smile"" and ""Are you lonesome tonight"" was sung and not played on the trumpet. If I knew that beforehand I would not have bought the CD. I don't particularly enjoy his vocal performances; it's like a Harrison Ford role - he seems to be dying of heartache...just too much."
3,Buyer be alert,I purchased this item for a gift. When it arrived I found a disclaimer that it might not be workable on all players. I was unaware of that when I bought it. I did give it but felt a little hesitant about doing so if there were some defect.
1,Terrible Protection,"I recently bought this case because it seemed like it would work well to protect my screen while at work and last a long time, but I was wrong.....not only did it cause more damage to my screen becuase dust and dirt got trapped under the case and pressed against the screen causing scratches and marks.... The case has actually broken already along the side. This case is terrible and I would not recommend it to anyone who is interested in keepin there phone look new. It is also rather inconvenient to charge becuase it is very difficult to open the cover on the charger to plug it in, I had to take the case off everynight to charge it.....DON'T BUY IT!!!"
3,Decent,"The pole was installed with its own pad. But since it's black, I was a little concerned that my wife or I might accidentally bump into it at night. So I bought this blue one for the color, not for the padding.I installed it over the pad that came on the pole.It looks great and was cheap. So for what I needed, it's a good deal.But you don't want to consider this if it's your primary padding. There is no real padding with it."
3,"OK movie, worth watching.","I really didn't expect to find that much of action and first class production in this movie, the story is not that original, but the cinematography is really good, I like how they touch the subject of how much power the narcos have in Mexico and how they are linked with politics and get away with everything."
2,NOT marzipan,"these are patties made from crushed peanuts and sugar, no almonds, no almond paste. Doesn't even remotely taste like marzipan. Not bad, mind you, but not marzipan."
1,Nasa Hammer,"I recently had the opportunity to try a Stiletto hammer purchased by a co-worker. While I am glad that struggling defense contractors have found a broader market for their waresit does not drive nails for poor carpenters nor do I think it drives them four times as well as a good quality framing hammer. Buy this item if you have some serious compensating to do. You can carry it in your 1 ton, 4 wheel, stretch cab, diesel pick up."
3,Zach's review,I thought the book was kinda boring.He took forever to do what he was supose to do. It would have had have been better with more action.
4,Gretas Magic World,"My favorite thing about Fog Magic is when the fog comes in, Greta saw a different world. When she discovered the fog had magic in it was when she was looking for the milk cow and thought she saw a house in the fork of the road. Then Greta found friends on the other side of the mountain called Blue Cove. Her new friends name was Retha and Mrs. Morrill. My favorite part of the book was when Retha and Greta were picking berries and it was time for Greta to go home and Mrs. Morrill gave Greta a piece of pie to take home with her. When she got home the pie was gone from the pale. All in all I really liked reading this book and imagining what it would be like to be in another world. My least favorite part of the book was about Captain Cornwall dieing of yellow fever. It made Greta and Retha really sad."
3,Appearance vs. Reality,"A lot of the stories are great stories that show the depiction of appearance vs. reality. One for example of this is the story ""Tomorrow and Tomorrow"" by Adoboe James. This story is a a short story that has you seeing how things may seem one way, but not be true at all"
3,Lots of variety and some big names,"I bought this for the Adobe James story, Tomorrow and Tomorrow. I have only found four of his stories in print and they all are excellent. The one in this anthology was no exception, although I was a little disappointed at its length (only three pages). I enjoyed the long story Royal Jelly by Roald Dahl quite a bit. His 'horror' stories for adults are always understated but brilliant. The Distributor by Richard Matheson is one of his most famous, but was so complex I had to read it twice to keep track of what was going on. Harlan Ellison, Isaac Asimov and Betty Ren Wright all turn in well written, enjoyable stories as well. My absolute favorite story was by an author I am unfamiliar with: Waldo Carlton Wright. Little Foxes Sleep Warm was an amazing read from start to finish. Highly recommended!"
3,Life Was Easier Then.,"Life in the South in segregaded times wasn't so bad. Life was easier for everyone. No dissension or crime against the other race. No problems of any kind in this town where I grew up. Only a few miles from here, in Oak Ridge, the school was integrated without provocation, as George Wallace was not our governor. It wasn't so easy to make changes in the smaller towns near Alabama, because of his influence, no doubt. I was told that they were driving around town with guns. Most people were afraid to get out at night.In this town now, it is that way again. No one is safe, but mostly I think it is all about drugs and not race. For thirty years or more, they have had their way with the white trash who wanted the drugs. They have the big cars, Jaguars, Cadillacs, and TownCars as the drug money will allow them to pay cash."
4,Wunderkind,"I admire, but do not really love the Bach-Partitas and -Sonatas.But Hilary Hahn is a Wunderkind.Whereas most of the violinists who have the unfortunate idea to choose as encore some of these pieces - which are partly, especially the fugues, real tours de force or musical SUDOKUs - give the impression to swallow a bitter medicine, she succeeds in playing them in a fluid, often expressive manner.Congratulations!"
2,Nothing special,"The illustrations are pretty, the concept is cute but... nothing stands out apart from the quietly amusing concept of building friends, which seems to appeal to adults more than 2yr olds."
5,Awesome,"I first used a Rebel in high school in my photojournalism class. The ease of use impressed me instead of intimidating me. Ever since then I knew I wanted a Rebel for my own. This Christmas I was more than pleased to find one under the tree for me. I love the new design, the grip makes it easy for a woman to hold onto, not too bulky. It focuses so quickly and takes pics very rapidly. The pics it took looked like a professional took them. It's a great camera, not just for beginners. Just put simply, it's awesome."
3,Mrs. Mike,"I was born in Calgary,Alberta, Canada and when I was young & sick, my mother gave me this book to read. It is my favorite book-as in if you were on a deserted island with only one book what would it be? Anyways I didnt know that they made this into a movie so just had to buy it. The book is better. It's nice to have for my collection but cant say will watch it very often. Leaves alot of the best parts out. The actors were not bad and you had to laugh at some of the details, but......all in all it wasnt a bad old movie (black & white)....."
3,Worked for a while,"The charger worked well for a while, but quit after a few months. Really what do you expect from a few bucks. Good for the price."
4,great gloves,"snug, nice grip, and no more blisters from the drums. however the only complaint I find is the stuff on the inside dyes your hands black for a while and you have to scrub a bit to get it all off. after about 6 or so uses it doesn't do it as much"
3,Pretty good but not great,"I purchased this because I am a Hepburn fan and also because I have just finished reading Sam Irvin's bio of Kay Thompson, which is a corker!!A bit formula and dated with some second rate music. Hepburn and Thompson shine, but Astair is far too old for his part. Nice Paris location shots. Try American in Paris instead."
2,Watchable,"It's always a pleasure to see Fred's legwork, but his relationship with Hepburn is completely implausible due to huge age difference and weak plot."
4,Audrey Dances,"This is not the typical Audrey Hepburn movie.I heard that Ms. Hepburn took ballet lessons but was too tall to get taken seriously. In ""Funny Face"" she dances with Fred Astaire and one can see the ballet moves.I'd much rather see Fred Astaire dance with Rita Hayworth, but gave it a four star for the dancing."
4,Dancing + Music + Hepburn = Great Film,"Funny Face was just fun to watch, if you like the style of movies in its time period. The only weird part of the movie is the age difference between Fred Astaire and Audrey Hepburn. Otherwise, it was a joy to watch."
1,This was HORRIBLE,"This was one of the WORST Roni Size CD's I have heard to date. Very disappointing. What happened to the Roni Size who made New Forms? That was the CD that first got me hooked and until this point I had been tolerating all of the CD's that followed, but this is the absolute worst music I have heard."
3,"No, It's not Newforms.","In case anyone's wondering why the reviews are so mixed on this album, I'll clear it all up. Half of us want this album to be ""Newforms Part 2"" (or Part 3, technically) very badly. The other half of us appreciate the album on its own without the troubling ""Newforms"" comparison. I'm personally kind of in the middle, as I heard ""In the Mode"" long before ""Newforms."" Yes, ""In the Mode"" is pretty good, yes it's worth buying/ripping/stealing/taping/remixing/whatever, but damn, man. It sure as hell ain't ""Newforms."" But again, what is?-MediakillP.S. Spell-check your reviews, you're making fools of yourselves."
3,No New Forms,This album is clearly no New Forms but there are definate merits to it. Criticism has been given to Who Told You but its over aggressive tendencies really appeal to me and the Dirty Beats track has a certain feel and creates an atmosphere that helps me to vent my aggression. I am not really a Drum n Bass fan but this isn't really dnb it is more breakbeat I reckon. Certainly worth a listen.
2,"Kind of fun, but flawed","I enjoy raising Sea Monkeys, so I was tempted by the description of the Swarm kit. Though it does indeed produce a LOT of pets quickly, they didn't seem to grow as fast as sea monkeys, and they all died off within a week despite my careful efforts. The instructions with the packet are way too vague, and the feeding ""spoon"" is just a cut-off tip of a drinking straw, with no indication of how much food they need. I think the Swarm kit may be good for adding a scoop to revitalize an existing sea monkey tank, but on its own it just seems unstable (and the weak instructions definitely make this a bad choice for children). And at more than double the cost of a basic, no-tank Sea Monkey kit, it just isn't worth it."
4,Extremely good intro,"This book is a very well explained and logically presented introduction to college level physics. Although Giancoli does not give the most rigorous examples in the text, the sheer number of end of chapter problems will satisfy anyone looking for practice. I understand physics in a much better way after reading this book: Ginacoli explains concepts in an excellent manner, leaving the reader in doubt as to the implication and application of what he has just read. Physics ceases to be just point objects rotating and flying through the air. This is a good book...anyone with some common sense can do well in physics with this book and attendance of lectures"
4,A book everyone should read!,"I've had this book for almost 10 years! It is still on my ""priority"" bookshelf, where other books have been demoted to the basement or given away.The book is organized into easy shopping sections; automobiles, food/groceries, pets, home energy, etc. It makes it easy to find information quickly.It offers many fast facts that are easy to read and informative. I still quote from the book (as a matter of fact I'm here because I pulled the book today from the shelf to get the statistic on percentage of pesticides used to make food LOOK good....the number is 40%).I took one star off the rating because it IS 10 years old now and it really needs an updating.If you're looking for ways to be a better green consumer and want to learn along the way...this fabulous book is for you!"
1,Moral of the story: cut hair short to get rid of curls,"I was hoping to find a book for my curly haired daughter that reaffirms that her curly hair is beautiful and desirable. I was shocked to find the main character in this book is teased by the local townspeople about her hair. In response, she tries quips and insults, straightening her hair, and finally resorts to cutting her hair so short she is looks like a boy.There is nothing about this book I can recommend, except to avoid it."
1,Buyer Beware- This is a Bootleg,"This is not supported by Christopher Lee in any way and his signature is being used without his permission The company releasing this is a well known bootlegger.Quality is likely to be quite poor on this, as well."
5,Everybody's physicist,"Dr. Feynman's love of science is most evident when he does presentations for non-professionals. His descriptions are complete and clear, helping us truly understand without the overwhelming mathematics that is his stock in trade. I am a physicist myself, and I still learn something every time I read one of his books. Try ""You Must Be Kidding"" for another fun trip."
5,This album is SIck....,"This is a pretty dang good album. Pond and his bandmates are popping out songs like an Amish woman pops out babies. This is his fifth full length I think, that is remarkable. His songs will make you happy to be able to hear."
3,Shane and Shane,"I must admit that it is cool to see Shane and Shane perform, but I noticed that the audio and the video was a little off(about a half a second or less) and therefore it looks a little weird. Also the video quality overall looks like video, but that would explain the cost of a cd and dvd being about 13 dollars. The audio cd is great if you do not have the songs already. but if you do (like me) then its pretty much just a repeat. Arise is the only new song that Shane and Shane fans will not have. Other than previous set-backs the audio/dvd is a great collection for those people who are just getting into Shane and Shane, checking them out, or is an avid fan. The price makes it very affordable as well... If you have all the cd's of the band and you have seen them in concert, then perhaps 13 dollars for one new song is asking to much."
4,Best of Bonanza,Great to see some from each of the series of Bonanza. My only disappointment was that the Bonanza theme song was not on the DVD. Takes away the pre-program hype!!
1,Title is a Mis-nomer,"The correct title should have been ""Uncopy-righted Episodes of Bonanza"". Obviously, Mill Creek didn't want to pay any royalties so even the theme song was substituted with a cheesy recording of the company owner's brother strumming a guitar (just my guess). My poor review is not a slight against the Bonanza series. These are actually excellent. I just feel duped because I can pull these epsidoes down off the Internet for free."
4,Love Bonanza!,"I really enjoyed the episodes that are on these dvds, however, it does not have the origional theme song. Also, sometimes the picture quality was not that great."
1,SCENE MISSING on the DVD!!,"I was amazed to see the running time is only 92 minutes, cut from the 93 minute normal version. The DVD does not have the food scene on the plane. Just as Steve Martin was going to eat the desert (cake I believe) the lady in front of him put her hair down right in the food. THE SCENE IS MISSING!Everyone needs to put pressure on Paramount to make a corrected DVD showing the entire movie!"
4,"Fairly funny, will appeal to sentimental types","Full marks to Steve Martin for keeping a straight face in the most absurd situations. The core plot is an excellent idea, but the ending is extremely sentimental and some will find it too cloying."
5,Hilarious after 3 viewings!,"A true comedy classic with two comedy ""greats"". [the late John Candy and Steve Martin]/"
5,AWESOME MOVIE,"This is a classic movie, I have always wanted to own it. It's so funny, never fails to make me laugh. It was brand new and just as described."
5,The best comedy ever,Not much to say here. Steve Martin and John Candy show why they are comedy legends. Pick this one up and you'll be sure to never watch the untalented likes of Adam Sandler or Will Ferrell ever again.
5,A holiday classic.,"One of my favorites. Yes it's sappy, maudlin at times, and Steve Martin isn't the greatest straight man in the world. But John Candy is brilliant, and their characters' feelings are universal."
2,Mostly a ploy by the DVD company to get $30 with nothing extra to offer.,"Where is the supposed 3 hours of material that is on the cutting room floor that John Hughes said ""deteriorated?"" Maybe someone could actually check and use the footage. I hate to trample on John Hughes grave, but it was widely noted in many interviews that Hughes knew there was a lot of footage from this movie, and why he didn't even try to go after it is a mystery to me. This movie had one of the biggest followings for any comedy in the late 80's, and while other Hughes movies from this era are still shown to give a few chuckles, this movie is still regarded as being hilarious, even some 25 years later! Could they not have interviewed Steve Martin, or maybe even included some old interviews from Candy or Martin from around the time this came out? Now the price is over $40 as of today (3/15/12), and it seems like the Blu Ray release of this movie was a total joke, especially with nothing new to offer."
5,"Great movie, strange pricing; buyer beware","This is a great movie but then you probably already know that and are considering a purchase if you're reading this review.As of this writing the Blu-ray version is available through Amazon in two different packages, this one supposedly from Amazon itself and another one from Amazon Associates. In reality, though, it appears that both versions are just copies purchased from ""your local Big Box store. The one with the Blue Color theme and the Yellow Tag logo"" and being resold on Amazon with a huge markup. If you want this movie then you'll pay a lot less if you go to that retailer's web site and order it directly from them instead of buying it through Amazon."
5,Great movie,"Very funny, but not for young viewers. I have watched this movie any times over the years. I got tired of renting it, so I purchased it."
3,Really Three-and-a-half stars on four star scale. Canadian hottie Lalia Robbins is worth watching for 1:45 min(s) by herself!,"Steve Martin's absolute best ever! AndCandy is the icing on the cake. Yes, theydo EVENTUALLY make it home. Bittersweet,absolutely hilarious comedy-drama aboutstuff Martin, business-exec.-type (com-plete with block hat!) who runs afoulsavvy-travel vet shower curtain-ringsalesman supremo, Candy. Their misad-ventures plus great family ending makethis a holiday favorite. No better holi-day travel time to parody than Thanks-giving Day! But fortunately I never raninto these two. Great parring! Couldhave been shorter though. Edning comestoo quick. Small complaint though."
3,planes trains automobiles,I had always watched the edited version on tv. We threw this one in the trash because it was so bad in language.
4,That's it?,"Just the film? No give-me's? No side dishes? Movie a la carte? No interviews, outtakes... nothing?Fortunately the movie itself is a decent comedy. PLANES, TRAINS AND AUTOMOBILES is a fine film in a long tradition of road films, where the final destination is seemingly impossible to reach (like CLOCKWISE, AROUND THE WORLD IN 80 DAYS, e.g.) Steve Martin and John Candy make a surprisingly good team, and John Hughes lets them cut loose, fortunately. Unfortunately, the ending lurches into the treacly, sentimentality that Hughes just can't seem to avoid. Scratch that last comment, the ending I suppose is okay for this comedy. Give this film a view."
1,Volume sucked,"I can't hear the sound unless you turn it the volume all the way up ,,,and all you hear is the hummmmmm"
5,Absolutely the Funniest Movie Ever Made,"This movie, is my all time favorite funny movie. I was in the video business in the mid 80's through 1994, when this movie came out. When it made it to video tape, I watched it over and over again. I mean hundreds of times. And the thing is STILL funny. I watch it on TV, and even with the edits it's still funny. You have to see it in the origional format, with the origional dialogue at least once. But no matter what you do, see it, buy it, and watch it over and over again. I Still can't help myself laughing when this is on. And I'm one of those boring nerd types that don't laugh at anything. This movie will be the best investment in laughter you will ever make."
2,Alternate Aloha Debacle,"I'm amazed to see this concert rated so highly. Sure the sound quality is great but what else do you get for your money? You get Elvis mumbling,stumbling, forgetting lyrics. Elvis either half asleep or in some drug induced haze. Darn good thing this was only the rehearsal. That gave Elvis time to get himself togethet for the actual broadcast.As for the songs themselves only Burning Love and Steamroller Blues are(argueably) sung better here than during the actual satellite show.My advice? Buy Elvis-Aloha from Hawaii instead. You get All the songs on this disc and more!! and the sound on the remastered Extra Tracks version is fantastic. All the pluses with none of the minuses. Enjoy!!"
2,Like many others french movies,"Lately There's a standard format in many french movies. A few of them are really interesting. This is not one of them. Very predictable, very clichè movie. Be careful with all the 5 stars review, not just for come from French must be a good movie. There's a lot of people that think in this way."
5,"YOU ""GO"" BOY!","This is a man of integrity -- a high caliber person and attorney! I can't imagine this man putting his heart and efforts behind someone who ""he"" believes is ""guilty"" -- it's not in his character to do so! I believe he did what he had to do and DID IT WELL! He's a hero and role model for all upcoming Black attorneys. ""If you're gonna do it -- DO IT RIGHT!"""
2,Not what I thought it was,"The video itself is good...I like the instructor...however, if you are looking for a routine, this aint it. She spends about 10-15 minutes stretching and warming up which is actually a good thing for me because I take about that long to get warm. However, as opposed to teaching a few short routines and repeating them, she spends over 30 minutes teaching one very long routine which you perform for about 10 minutes at the end. Again, decent routine and she is really entertaining, but if you are looking for a good workout...this isn't really it.Great examples of some samba moves though if you're just looking for some tips!"
3,"No music, only drumming...","I am disappointed in this workout video. I was hoping for Latin music with a salsa beat, but this one is drumming only.I like Quenia, she is a really good teacher, and her dance routine is good, but the drums are a little much."
1,Don't waste your money.,"Watched it once, moves too complicated, lot of shaking and complicated footwork. This will end up in the tag sale for 50 cents."
2,Don't waste your time!,"I just purchase this dvd,and what a wase of money! The drums in the background were so loud i could bearly here what she was instructing. The moves didn't seem so differcult, but it just took to long to finish the dance pratice part of the dvd. Once that was done, she only done 2 sets and just like that, it was all over with!"
2,wanted to love it,"I bought this based on the many great reviews. I love the instructor for her energy and spirit, loved the live music, loved the dancing but was majorly disappointed by two things: 1. There are basically only 2 combinations on the entire DVD and they are the same combinations just at different speeds (very slow, very fast). The combination is a good one and the fast version IS a good workout but there's no variety beyond that. 2. There is no cool down. If you do the fast version, you need a cool down involving stretching. This instructor is so great, I just wish the DVD offered a few more sections because I'm not all that motivated to do the same 2 combinations all the time."
3,"Some great insights, but hard to read","Vollert's book contains many great insights, but most readers will find this very tough going, indeed. The strength of this book is its rigorous taxonomy of real options and stochastic processes, extensive bibliography, and criticism of naive DCF models. However, the reader will need extensive mathematical background and already understand much of what is contained here.Motivated and mathematically able readers may want to consider Dixit and Pindyck's classic Investment Under Uncertainty, or a recent compendium like that of Smit and Trigerois. Those interested in a less intensive, but still rigorous, overview should consider Anderson's Business Economics and Finance [my book]. Those interested in just applying some real options analysis could choose from many books, including the Mun book. Note that many of these, however, are full of black-box thinking that can result in ridiculous results. Vollert's book, while difficult, at least avoids this error."
4,Weak on the standard model!,"I used this book for a 3rd year university course in subatomic physics. What I particularly liked was the two chapters on symmetries, which were thorough compared to what i have seen in comparable textbooks. I also found the chapters on nuclear physics quite good, as they gave a very compact presentation of the most important aspects of this subject. The weakest part of the book in my opinion is the chapter on the standard model.If you don't know math and quantum mechanics you shouldn't buy this book as it is somewhat mathematical in style and uses fewer words than many comparable textbooks. Readers who want a historical treatment of the subject matter should look elsewhere too, as this book tells little about the experiments that were instrumental in developing subatomic physics."
2,No rigor and slightly misleading,"I used this book for my first 400-level course in junior year. I found right off the bat that it is a bit difficult to adjust to, as it will probably be one of your first books with the CGS unit system. This might cause miscommunication with the author and reader- for example, q*(r)^-2 is the electric field, but it will seem to be missing the constants of nature in front. While this is a well-known example of CGS use, some other formulas have an enigmatic nature because of these features. Also, many topics are covered but quickly given up as enigmatic features because little rigorous derivation takes place. For the most part, it does introduce many new concepts of nuclear and particle physics but with few and ambiguous explanations of the mathematics behind it all."
2,Misleading Ad,The ad conveniently hides the fact that this is a solutions manual for the author's text and does not link to the text book. What a rip off.
1,1 filter and 1 housing - NOT a 2 pack,"I own a chrome filter housing and have been using these filters for a while. So when I saw ""filter 2 pack"" at a good price I ordered it without reading any reviews. I mean i ALREADY know how the filters are and I expected to receive TWO filters, not one and a housing! HORRIBLE item description. Fortunately Amazon was good about returning it and no shipping costs. So if you want a filter and the housing order up! But if you're expecting to get 2 filters then look somewhere else."
1,"Warning, Wrong Item!","The description for this item is clearly for a filter replacement 2-pack. However, this is NOT what you will receive. What I found upon opening the shipping box was a small single box that said ""Slim Line Shower Filter"" on the top with a barcode label on the side that read ""Sprite Slim Line Filter Cartridge 2-Pack New."" So basically the box is labeled correctly, but they shipped an actual shower filter unit instead.It looks like others have received two filters excepting the housing?? So it seems like by ordering this item you are rolling the dice. You'll either receive a shower filter unit, the filters for a Sprite shower filter, or maybe a combination of the two. I don't know. Amazon's great customer service got me a refund with ease."
4,Sure Beats Tae Bo,"I had my doubts about being able to learn to dance from a DVD. I just didn't think it would be motivating. The stack of exercise DVD gathering dust by my entertainment center can attest to my affinity for tape-inspired motivation...or should I say lack thereof. But, I've been going strong with this DVD for a full 5 weeks now. I actually enjoy it. I don't know if it's because of the music or the patterns or what but it's working for me and keeping me active daily. Exercise under the `guise of dancing. Who knew all this time I just needed a great Salsa DVD."
5,Turns Turned My Attitude Around,I was hesitant at first about this whole Salsa dancing thing but things started looking up once I got to this DVD. I figured out that I had a mental block or something-years of thinking I was hopelessly rhythm-less-but I'm over it. Had me some fun learning the turns and things taught on this DVD. Bring on number three?.
4,Fun for young and old,"I found this a fun way with my children to review familiar bible stories often taught in sunday school. My children (ages 2 & 9) enjoyed it through singing with and ""dancing"" around to the music. The songs are biblically sound. As with most children's music it has a fun rhythm to the songs."
4,it serves it purpose,"this booklet is actually 9 laminated index cards held together by a keychain ring. it also has a small bottle opener. i have not used it much yet, but it seems simple enough.it's arranged in ABC order and provides the following info for each drink:type of glass used, ingredients, method of pouring (shaken, blend, over ice, etc.), and garnish used.it definitely serves as a quick reference, but not much more than that. i recommend it if this is all you need it for."
1,leaves out important parts,"Why did the Author omit the Ragilim? These were by far the most numerous of the beings who did the main work of Creation, their name means ""Foot (Soldiers)"", and who also helped out in many battles where the Americans would otherwise have been outnumbered by the French.There was also the Angel Fulano, who flew around and around the Ark, to make sure that it settled, rather than cracked up, when it landed on Pike's Peak. Why did he not talk about this?There are clear indications that this book was written by the UN.Beware."
3,....,Not enough information is covered in this book...I just bought our first mini and wanted more details. This book just scratched the surface. It really lacked information on caring for minis. It did contain a lot of information on their history and had a basic introduction to showing them.
2,what can I say?,"I was expecting a lot from this CD: I'd heard a lot of RSJ's music and really liked it so when I went ahead and bought this I just couldn't wait for it to land in my mailbox. Unfortunetely I can't say I was pleased. The lyrics are great, don't get me wrong but the melodies were just...strange. On the 2nd track we get some funky techno music, and on the last track a very calm tune, on the 7th track a more ''popish'' one. I guess there just isn't any harmony in it all. Too bad because there are some really good messages in there but they're clouded by attempted post modern music.the 2 stars are for the very pleasant songs ''wait for me'' and ''my hope''"
2,Not the greatest . . .,"This CD was OK . . . I mean I can't give it 5 stars because I didn't like most of the songs. My only favorites were . . .- Reborn- Wait for Me- StandThose were the only good ones . . . if you like songs that are not boring and have wonderful tunes. The rest of the songs weren't that great. I LOVE Rebecca St. James' music, but I didn't find most of these tracks enjoyable. But you could have a different ""music outlook"" than I, and may instead actually enjoy this CD. Though in my opinion, I think there are better RSJ CDs. I would suggest ""Wait For Me"" (the best of) CD - it's absolutely her very best (I'm sure you would agree if you bought it)! So if you just want to collect every RSJ CD there is - just ignore my complaining and get this one. But if you would like to get just one of her CDs . . . this shouldn't be the one! Check out WAIT FOR ME!!"
4,"Great CD but not as good as ""Pray""","This is a wonderful CD, but I don't think it is her very best. If you are a fan of hers, pick this CD up soon! You'll really like it. If you want a good introduction to her music, I recommend ""God"" or ""Pray"" as both are excellent projects. I really like her use of classical instrumentation mixed with rock in this project. In some songs however, she uses a techno, electronic sort of sound which does not become her as well as her guitars. Tracks 4 and 9 are my favorites."
3,So-so,"The title was pretty accurate-she has transformed, musically, almost beyond recognition. Her previous CD, 'Pray' was in most ways much better than this newest release. This CD samples different styles of music, and bears no resemblance to her past work. I thought that 'Transform' was OK, overall; the best songs are 'My hope' and 'Don't worry'"
3,CHAIRS,FEELS LIKE WE ARE SLIDING OFF THE CHAIRS NOT ENOUGH ANGLE PERHAPS YOU SHOULD WRITE THE REVIEW IF YOU NEED MORE WORDS
2,6 Months Later,"I've had these chairs for a little over 6 months. I'm writing the review because I am now out here looking for new chairs. When I first received the chairs I was pretty pleased with them. They were definitely smaller than the chairs I had before, but the style was what I wanted and the price was good. The main problem that all four chairs are having is with the legs as they attach to the base of the seat. The whole construction of the chair down there is less than ideal and now after 6 months they are really quite unusable. The chairs have not broken, but when you sit down on them they wobble about and it feels like you will shortly be on the floor. I'm sorry, but I would not recommend these chairs for someone to purchase as I feel the quality is too low."
2,Not good quality,"I purchased these chairs to replace the chairs I had for eight years but are now all broken except for one. Since purchasing these chairs, two of them have broken already and we've only had them a few months. I would not recommend this product unless you don't plan on sitting on them."
5,Memorable and sentimental story,"I loved the way this movie unfolded, and I was saddened by the destruction of the Enterprise the first time I saw the movie. I'm hoping that cue from that scene can one day be available for online sale on MP3"
2,A soporific film,"I enjoy most of the Star Trek television shows, and some of the movies. This movie was showing while I was on a flight from Japan to the US many years ago, and it was the first I'd seen it.I normally can't sleep sitting up, but this movie did the trick for me. Halfway through the film (probably during one of the dramatic scenes between Kirk and his estranged son) I drifted off, and arrived back home well rested thanks to Captain Kirk and company.I recommend it to non-fanatics who are having trouble getting to sleep."
1,Star Trek III: The Search for Spock,This VHS tape was in its original packaging however the sound is bad and the tape is very noisy. It must not have been stored properly.
3,Average ST Film.,"Alone, I believe that this film could not stand as a good one. Hanging in between 2 and 4, this one is much stronger. Put the three together, this trilogy can hang with others, including Star Wars. Non-Trek fans probably wouldn't be interested, esp if they haven't seen TWOK. Trek fans might mark it as a member of the odd number curse, which is a little un-fair, since this film delivers the bridge story between 2 and 4. I think that it also has the best Star Trek film moment ever: Kirk steals the Enterprise...Great. Those expecting another Wrath of Khan will be disapointed. Those expecting another Motion Picture will be delighted. An average film."
4,Not the best but GOOD!!,I really liked Christopher Lloyd in this film. It was not the best of the eight movies but anything Star Trek is great!!
4,Fantastic sequel to a great Adventure,"Exciting sequel to 1982's Wrath of Khan, full of action and adventue but not sparing a wonderful plot and story, (Star trek III:Search for Spock)Finds Admiral Kirk morning over the loss of his beloved friend and commrad, only to find later that he may not be dead. Directed by Lenard Nimoy"
4,Another success,"If you're hoping for extra footage, well forget it. What you do get is another excellent transfer, sound, and commentaries, although Leonard Nimoy should've brought a buddy to talk with. He's pretty boring to listen to.There are plently of extras to keep you from missing the extra footage the previous DVDs included.Well worth it."
4,Live Long and Prosper Spock!!,"Star Trek III - The Search for Spock Is not one of my favorite Star Trek feature films, but it is worth the buy in my opinion for the Special Features alone. It must be said that most Star Trek fans already own this DVD. Someone who is not a Star Trek fan or has never seen Star Trek II - The Wrath of Kahn would be lost, then again; these films are so deeply engrained into our culture that if you did get lost by this film you must have been living under a rock for many years! lol!"
4,Great!,I bought this to use in the house (I know that may seem crazy). It has foam handles and it's easy to use for little hands. Overall great product.
1,Not worth it,"I thought this book would be interesting and informative. It wasn't. I practice attachment parenting and was turned off by the pushiness of the author. Her reliance on operant conditioning is carried too far as well (and I have 2 masters degrees in psychology.) She also suggests that if you don't have a rigid schedule, you'll never potty train your child. My 10 month old went on the toilet today, and I don't have a rigid schedule, so the anecdotal evidence is against her already."
2,Contradictory,"The first few sections of this book has some good conspiracy information about diaper companies and why we wait so long to train, but then has a fairly negative tone for parents who do wait to train. Talks a lot about just going forward and not worrying about ""mental readiness"" but actual training sections have a different opinion. This books seemed to be very negative towards parents who aren't training by 5 months and then LESS than helpful information for everyone else.Try Toilet Training in Less Than a Day instead."
4,"Great book, full of insight!","Books like this one crush what is considered to be conventional wisdom in America. Most people in non-""Western"" countries potty train their children long before the age of two. It's healthier psychologically and much more hygienic and this book explains why."
4,Good coin folder,"This is a good coin folder. I started collecting earlier this year (2011). This holds my Sacagawea Dollar Folder pretty well. Sometimes a bit tight, though, but I suppose it's because it has to hold the coins better."
1,Forget it!,"My wife and I have driven to Florida many times over the years and were quite interested when we heard about this book. What a disappointment, it's a waste of money. The print quality is terrible and looks as if it was printed on a dot matrix printer. It is full of advertising some of which is passed off as editorial material. Although it has discount coupons, one of the main one expired on 3/31/99. We also found that many of the ""discount"" coupons were just requests for standard tourism information which is available to anybody from state welcome centers. Finally, the savings on several of the ""real"" motel discount coupons were not as good as those available through **free** motel coupon books we picked up at rest areas."
4,Socially and racially conscious music,"This album contains a few of my all-time favorite Bob Marley and the Wailers singles- Concrete Jungle, Kinky Reggae and Rainbow Country, which I've only found on one other album of theirs and which is missing.Their music is deceptive: some of the happiest sounding songs are raging social and racial commentary, like ""Small Axe"" (not on this album). You're drawn by the beats and stay for the message."
4,Good but I Like the Remake Better!,This old Sabrina movie is good and I think its a really sweet movie and I really like Audrey Hepburn but I'm so sick of people putting the remake down especially people who've never seen it. Well I have seen it and it's just as good as the old one! This old one is good though and I recommend it to fans of Audrey and old movies! But to be perfectly honest I like the remake more. I can just see all the click on unhelpful for that but guess what? I don't care! It's not like I'm going to cry boo hoo hoo over unhelpful votes!
1,Can't rate the mov,"As Amazon video does not work on any of the products I have bought.each plays the first 2% of the program, and then freezes. On the movie, it's about 1m12s into the show - on the tv series I have bought, it's about 32s or 38s into the show.Therefore, the product is faulty.Rob."
4,Well done.,I have enjoyed both this original as well as the remake and really I like them both just as well.
2,Stainless & PLASTIC Strainer,The main complaint is the product is more plastic than stainless. Looks nice in my new sink but light weight plastic concerns me over the long haul. For the price product should be more substantial.
5,Great combinations with Delta Touch2o Faucet,- Easy installation - no tools required. Some putty used for seal.- Nice and sturdy Delta Flange looks nice with Delta Faucet.- Nice fit with Stainless steel sink.
4,Great product but shop around for better pricing,"This is a great product, both my children loved it. It's definitely not compact, but it only takes up space for as long as you use it (and really, it's only a few months per child). However, I cannot get over the blatant price-gouging on Amazon marketplace--this product should not be over $70 (and even that is overpriced), but as of today is being sold for $137.50 through Amazon. GO ELSEWHERE!"
4,Great product but WAY overpriced,"I like this product, as does my son (though he hasn't quite figured out how to jump yet). But, it is totally not worth $170. I fail to see why it is so expensive, and no toy for an infant should cost that much. It only really plays one song. For $170 it should offer many more features. I bought mine at a consignment store and paid next to nothing. I say it's worth $75 at most brand new, which is about the price of the Rainforest Jumparoo It is a great toy, though it is big and rather cumbersome to lug around. However, to us it was a much better option than a door jamb jumper."
4,A fun toy,We bought the jumperoo for our 4 month old at Christmas and he really likes it! He bounces like crazy in it but tires of it pretty fast. This system is fun for short bursts but he really gets more use out of the exersaucer.
2,PRICE ??!?,May I ask please why is this item 65 dollars as recommended on fisher price website and it is 169 sold here? Please explain
4,OK TOY and GREAT IDEA BUT OLDER JUMPERS ARE MUCH MORE FUN!!!,"We bought this jumper and Olivia really liked it but only for short periods of time. For something free-standing there is not enough toys to keep her entertained. She doesn't even bounce in it that much anymore at 7 months. We then purchased an older model that attaches to the door frame and she went nuts in that. I don't know why but she stays in that MUCH longer and seems to have alot more fun. So if you can find a nice one, I'd get the ""johnny jump-up"" model before spending on this. We found a new one for $10.00 at a second hand store."
4,Good Toy but not compact,This is a good toy for babies to have some fun bouncing around. The only pet peeve I have is that it is advertised as being able to fold up however when it is folded up it is not that much smaller than when its open. Its a lot bigger than I expected it to be. If space is an issue a gym saucer may be a better option.
5,Poems non-poets might actually want to read,"If you're tired of art about art, philosophy about philosophy, poetry about poetry, etc., tired of stuff that nobody other than fellow practictioners can get any sustenance from, this book is for you. Perhaps this is the wholesome influence of the poet not having a job in a university. These poems are very smart but recognizable, have humanity, fatigue, electricity, wisdom, and lots of humor. Poets must like these poems too since one of them was in the Best American Poetry of 2005 anthology. The cover by Kevin Riordan looks great on display too."
1,Not the correct product,"The product that I purchased was advertised as Pyramid Alloy Cable Tip, bottle of 500. This is a very specific advertisement, for those who are familiar with high-quality cable tips.What I was shipped, however, was not what was advertised, nor what I ordered.I did not receive the Pyramid brand of cable tips. I received SunLite branded cable tips.Neither did I receive correctly manufactured cable tips, having the flair at the cable-entry end of the cable tip body. I received a bottle of cable tips which have the appearance of having been manufactured ""backwards""; with the hydraulically-formed flair on the wrong end of the cable tip body.It is obvious to me that, under the advertised disguise of quality, Pyramid cable tips, the distributor is foisting-off cheap-quality, defective cable tips to unsuspecting buyers.Do not purchase this advertised item."
5,I've been using o.b. Tampons for seven years ...,"I've been using o.b. Tampons for seven years and wouldn't change a thing. o.b. Tampons are very discreet during that embarrassing week, because they have no applicator. The entire tampon can fit in your pocket and be discarded down the toilet when you're through with it. The price is comparable to other brands and the quality is just as high. o.b. tampons are great for those who hate doing the walk to the bathroom with the purse thing. For those of you who feel funny using a tampon without an applicator, try the new o.b. Tampons with applicator to get the same superior quality from o.b. I'd suggest these tampons to anyone -- they're the only brand I use."
4,Pass it On!,"Every track on this album is so powerful. Harold's lyrics and sound are REAL - and his true passion for his music is what I like best about this collection. ""Pass it On"" has a bluesy Brian Adams flavor to it, with such soul that you really FEEL the lyrics. The melody of ""Sangita"" just invites you to groove along. Truly a must have CD for music enthusiasts looking for a heartfelt performance by a genuine performer."
2,Waste of money.,"I bought this DVD, thinking that I probably made a mistake, and I was right. It has 9 classic episodes, plus the pilot episode as an added bonus. There is one problem: The bonus episode does not play in any DVD player I have, not even on my computer. I knew it looked like a cheap DVD, bought I wanted to see if I was right, because I know that looks can be deceiving. Not this time. It could be that I got a bad DVD, but it would probably be the best idea not for you to not buy this DVD."
4,crossbow QUIVER and ARROWS,ok so for everybody complaining about how the crossbow didnt come with the order its because its just the quiver they showed the picture with a crossbow so that you know how the quiver looks when you attach it to the wildcat crossbow and it doesnt even say anything about a crossbow coming with it
1,Item pictured is not what shipped,"I would have given this item zero stars except that is not possible. The item pictured is not what my 10-year-old grandson received when he opened the box. The item pictured is a crossbow with quiver and bolts. What is delivered is the bolts and a quiver. I am extremely disappointed that Amazon would allow this deceptive practice. A sharper reader would have discovered this, but most 10-year-olds don't expect to be deceived."
3,"Intersting, but bland","A story of a typical 19th C. woman in rural France. While the story seems true to the actual experiance of woman, it is the truthfulness of the story which makes it balnd. However, a good read for some insight on these women."
4,Simply awesome,"Wow Abel, another good one. Just bought it and all my friends love it. I have only heard this mans spin once, but he is definitely at the top of my list. If you have never been to an Alegria event, this will definitely make you want to go see what fuss is all about. Simply awesome...."
5,An absolute must for any country music fan,"Great songs by one of the best singers to hit country music.Candy Kisses,of course is unforgettable. The bulk of his playtime nowadays is from Candy Kisses, but don't forget the others. Room Full of Roses is equal to Jim Reeves, better in my opinion. Precoius Memories, Beyond the Sunset, Hello Darlin', Softly and Tenderly all have been done by others. Maybe more recently or better known, but none have done any of the songs equal to George.His voice has a timbre and tone equal to Eddy Arnold, and more than once I have had to wait for a couple of lines to make sure who was singing. I think he deserves to be held in equal standing with the Tennessee Plowboy, and this Album is all the evidence I need to base my stand upon.The PRICE is more than reasonable and the music is beyond compare. The only reason I didn't buy one right away is because I needed something for my Christmas list."
2,Boring and blase',"I have read all of his works. This one lacked passion and energy.What is the deal. All of his other books were good and ""And This Too Shall Pass"" was exceptional. It's as if he wrote this one in a couple hours of thought.The story formula is generic and uninspired. I wish I didn't buy it. Where is the passion or heck even the story telling?!Anybody can write this story. Harris seems to have put no heart into this writing. As a fan I am disappointed. And from reading all of the ""positive"" reviews, I wonder if they are true fans of E. Lynn Harris.I am and I expect more."
2,"5 stars for the music, but 2 for this version","This music rules, but buy the original US versions for both albums on the Chrysalis label. They sound the best."
2,Half-a**ed effort,"Excellent guitarist aside, this is a boring and uninspired album. The first few songs are dischordant (without attempting to be) and grate on the nerves. The album picks up about the time we hit song five, but we hit another low note at Lonely Nights.The best parts of this album are the bridges in Crazy. Too bad the rest of the song blows. Never Ending Nightmare is pretty good with a very cool guitar sound. Pick up Perfect Timing and Save Yourself, which are vastly superior albums, instead."
5,One of my fav Jazz albums!,The chemistry on this recording is great! It's such a shame we lost Kenny Kirkland he was destined to be one of the greats! Dizzy of course is Dizzy! It's really as if he's speaking through his trumpet.
4,Perfect for praticing cub scout skills!,"We got it for our 9 year old and he has improved on his bb gun 100%! It's great, inside or out the kids love it!"
2,A vanity book?,"See, even the greats must revise!Hey, I suppose it's interesting to read a guy's first drafts. Perhaps one can learn things about his psyche. But I certainly didn't learn much about writing, and in the last section of the book where all my supposed writing questions were answered, I found Michener pompous at best.I look at it this way: even the greats write awful first drafts!"
5,You shoulda heard 'em in the beginning,"Kon Tiki is indeed brilliant, but to put this record on the same tier as ""Sgt Pepper"" would probably even embarrass the Mather lads. Personally, I like their first (""Crafty Flower Arranger""), and second cd (Cotton Is King"") a little better, if just for the slightly rougher edge and slightly less self-conscious lyrics. Songs like ""Ivanhoe"" and ""Payday"" make me want to rebuild Liberty Lunch and The Electric Lounge by hand, brick-by-brick, just to put Cotton Mather inside and watch them perform, back when it was the original line-up (okay, maybe not with Wendy on drums, but then again, why the hell not?) Let's just say that if you're a ""pop tart,"" you really ought to have at least one CM record in your collection. Kon Tiki will certainly do."
4,A Lost Beatles Record?,"The Beatles/Lennon influence here is hard to ignore, but that would only be a bad thing if the songs weren't so GOOD. I often listen to this CD imagining it's a record the Beatles started recording between Revolver and Sgt Pepper, but never finished. A tuneful, lo-fi recording with some great, catchy tunes (My Before and After and She's Only Cool really stand out) make this Austin band's 2nd album a must-have for your collection!"
2,Help!,"This band is to the Beatles what Elvis impersonators are to Elvis. For a variety of reasons, Cotton Mather doesn't cut it. 1.) Can't sing. 2.) College-boy precocity. 3.) They just don't get it. There ARE some great Merseybeat revisionists out there. Myracle Brah comes to mind. The ""Shake Some Action"" era Flamin' Groovies, for another. If you want straight up Beatles parody/tribute, buy the two Ruttles discs."
3,Daddy is a winner!,"An unexpectedly well done film, with a good story, and fine acting. Very believable and emotionally engrossing. The blu-ray transfer is superb!"
2,This movie kind of sucks,I'm not going to write a huge massive story here however this movie just doesn't ever really start or come together. As a huge Perry fan I was grossly disappointed by the exaggeration that is 'Daddy's Little Girls'.The characters all all over-the-top and the movie is scattered and doesn't quite conclude at the end.I'd would wait until the sale at least before buying this one.
5,Lost Season 3,"Fantastic series, the only problem that I had with the 3rd season of Lost was that it was so compelling to watch, I now have withdrawals and can't wait to get Season 4."
5,Great Entertainment!,We really enjoyed getting the series and being able to watch it without commercials. We will wait until it is out on DVD to see season IV.
5,Outstanding as usual,"I order Lost season 3 and received it within 3 days. The product was as advertised, ""brand new""! Inside the box were all the cd's plus a booklet that briefly describes each episode. It is a must have for all Lost fans! I missed a few episodes during season 3 and now having watched the entire box set I understand certain aspects of the show that I didn't know. I had previously ordered season 2 from Amazon and it too was as advertised ""brand new"". I'm looking forward to when season 4 becomes available and will order that set as well. Amazon does as advertised in my association with them, thanks Amazon!!"
3,Disappointing ending,"The season in its entirety was a solid 3-stars in my book, but the season finale was a real disappointment.*Spoiler Alert* I really disliked the ""flash forwards"" of Jack's life falling apart and feel that it's a terrible ending to anticipate for the entire remainder of the series. Why would they do that in season 3 and not way later in the series? Hopefully, in season 4, we discover that it was just a nightmare he was having, or there will be some other ""out"" that results in a better life for Jack after all he's done for his fellow castaways. Knowing this early that he'll return home to a terrible life (presumably extreme symptoms of PTSD) is really disheartening."
5,Great Series; Hateable Season,"I'm loving LOST, but I'm really hating the 3rd season. While I understand that we need to get to know The Others and what motivates them i have to wonder did they have to be made so damn annoying? They beat, imprison, hunt down and generally have no sense of hospitality and then they want favors. Irksome is the word that comes to mind.But I love this series and I know that once I get past this hateful season all will be well again...right?"
3,Too much sex and a bad ending.,"I really enjoyed season 1 and 2, so I pre-ordered season 3. It was pretty disappointing though. It seems like they threw in all of these sex scenes for no apparent reason. I know that romance is appealing to the audience, but seriously-you can overdo it. Also, it's like at the ending of the season they show you how the show is going to end after getting off the island. Jack is a drunk and Kate is with a different guy, but we don't even know if it's Sawyer. It makes you not even want to watch the next season."
4,Great product but missing cover,The set is new but is missing the hard cover that goes with the case. I have the other seasons and they have it.
2,Lousy Season,"The product is ill packaged but otherwise ok.We waited and waited for this season and we are still waiting. We are stationed in Korea and were spared what must have been an excruciating week to week season. The season is pathetic. It moves at a snails pace up until the last two disks where apparently the writers and directors realized they had squandered away nearly the whole season and something had to be done quickly. One of the few good episodes features a dejected Hurly rising to the challenge and saving the day.Far too much time is spent on ""Jack"" and ""Freckles"" who are the least interesting characters on the show. One entire episode is devoted to people not previously main characters and who are dead in the end. A virtually wasted show.For Lost fans like my family you have to have this set but be warned. You'll be disappointed."
3,You make the call,"This book is either a beautiful love story and insightful look at Jim Morrison, or a work of deceiving, manipulative genious. I have read almost every book on Jim Morrison and The Doors and this woman was never mentioned once. Great detail has been given to all of Jim's serious girlfriends in the other books, with no trace of a Linda Ashcroft. However,amazingly, the book is so convincing that I am absolutely torn about what to think. If the book is a fake, I would stand in respectful awe of this author's brilliance. Either way, the book is enjoyable and I recommend it."
4,"Good read and has ring of truth, but her evidence was conveniently ""stolen""","Read this a few years ago and i thought it rang true to me, and i have been a student of All Things Morrison for over 20 years. But her shoebox of letters and photos etc was conveniently stolen or burned in a house fire... if it is fiction, this person is a truly gifted inventor and fabricator with a deep understanding of JDM. If it is fact, well then it's really cool to see this glimpse of JDM through the ""Ashen lady's"" window... I would love to know whether it is fact or fiction, but either way, i thought it was a compelling story, and i felt like it was giving a true insight into the life and times of the gifted rock artist."
2,Interesting Romantic Novel,"Linda Ashcroft writes acceptable prose and spins an interesting novel concerning her relationship with Jim Morrison. Obviously, there is no possible logistical way that the events could have transpired as written, given The Doors' very hectic travel schedules in those years. And too, there is scant or no collaborative evidence, not to mention that other Doors' biographers, very close to the events, have omitted her named entirely. Given that, and understanding that this work is fiction, I can recommend the book be enjoyed for its insights to muriad possibilities of partial truths."
2,I don't buy it,"Sorry, I just don't buy it. She just sounds WAY too intellectual and sophisticated for a 15 year old. No one ever heard of her. She has nothing to back this up. Her box full of Jim's letters and keepsakes were conveniently the only things stolen when she was supposedly burglarized. Other people who are knowledgeable about the Doors say her dates don't match up with when he was on tour. I believe this is wishful thinking, a waste of time and way too long."
1,Wild Child???????,"I can't believe that someone who had such fleeting liasons with Mr Morrison could churn out 500 pages. The 1 photo of the author in the book, is the day before she went to a Doors concert??? Where are the photos of them together??? As fiction it is a sweet tale....but there are better books out there by people who really knew the man, and have the facts and evidence to back up their claims. If you want a book abut Jim and his women, get Angels Dance and Angels Die instead. Now that is a book."
5,THE GIFT WAS THE BEST PRICE,EVEN ENOUGH I NEVER TRY THE PRODUCT. IT WAS THE BEST PRICE. AMAZON IS THE BEST PLACE FOR GIFT GIVING.
4,An excellent overview,"This book provides a wonderfully complete overview of a wide variety of silversmithing techniques. It doesn't provide detailed how-to instructions; if you are new to metalsmithing you will probably need additional instruction, but it is still a very useful resource. I learned a lot from it."
4,Mixed Blessing,"Pros: This text covers alot of techniques, has a good intro into metallurgy, and it has a great appendix.Cons: There are no photos, all of the illustrations are drawn so it makes it hard to really understand how to perform some of the techniques. Also, since the text covers so many different things it usually only devotes one or two pages for each technique.Overall, it is a good book to introduce you to techniques, but for the most part it does not go into enough detail to reproduce them. If it had photos rather than drawings it would be close to perfect."
5,important for your studio,"this book has a ton of valuable information. it is something that you have to own if you do any metal work at all. great reference for the studio. i would recommend it to anyone who has any interest in jewelery and metalworking, beginner to advanced."
1,Not working,"I ordered this product based on reviews, so far nothing has changed. Actually I have noticed an increase in my appetite. I have went on to research others that offer subliminal weight loss messages. If anyone has something they know works please forward to me at lavorges@yahoo.com"
2,PR in NW Iowa,"This is not what I expected. I bought a CD of Kelly Howells a few years back thru Avon. She talks in that one - so that is what I expected with this. I only hear music, and some... singing (?? Aahhhh, humming) but no verbal speaking to help lull you into relaxing. I found myself often thinking of other things I needed to do, and then would fall asleep. My interpretation of the instructions was to listen to track 1 while awake, and I just couldn't accomplish that. It did help me fall asleep though, but I haven't seen much change in my eating habits."
1,Too Long,"The pants do keep you warm, but the material is thin and they are too long. Even when pulled up, they fall back down and hang off the bottom of the feet, making it difficult to walk and keep the pants on the body."
1,Champion is no Champ,These pants are waaaaaaaaaaay too long and the bottom elastic is made to be loose; too loose for me. I like for my elastic to be more fitted at the ankles and these are not. They are made more like a straight legged pant that bunches at the bottom.
2,too long,"The pants are too long. The pants bottoms are practically open in spite of the elastic closure which are way too loose,so the pants being too long get caught under the shoes"
3,Don't seem as good as others I own,"I wear fleece pants a lot around the house in the winter. These did not seem as heavy as Russell Athletic, and also have started to ""pill"" very quickly. I do like the pockets in them, and they do have the drawstring for a good fit, however. I would compare these to Russell, and if they are close in price, probably goo with the Russell."
3,What happened to good old fashioned sweats?,I share several other reviewers' complaint about the elastic cuffs. Champion may as well have not put elastic there. The openings are so large that the elastic is useless.Still looking for a decent pair of sweats.
3,"Comfortable, warm, but prone to piling","I got a few pairs of these pants for working out in my unheated garage. They work great for that purpose. As some have mentioned, they are on the longer side, but that is actually good for me. I'm 6'2"" and the XXL length is perfect, although the waist is quite large. That's not a problem, as it can be cinched down.However, the first time I washed these, they developed quite a lot of piling (the little balls of fabric). I'm not sure what I expected from cheapish sweatpants, I guess."
2,Elastic in ankle was useless,"Thought I was helping my dad with this order but the pants were such a disappointment! The elastic around the ankle was useless, and therefore created a wide leg pant that hung over the shoe. Not what the picture shows, and not what we wanted. Material is thin, and not what I would expect from a Champion product!"
2,Elastic Leg Cuffs Too Weak,"The description of the pants includes elastic cuffs. I expected the pants to be too long for me, but with elastic cuffs it doesn't matter. However these cuffs were much too weak to hold the cuffs up and I would have to cut them off to make them fit properly. Good quality product, just the cuff elastic was the problem. Easy to return with Amazon."
4,Champions,The stitch in this pants was pulling out very disappointed.....I couldn't bother to send it back cause I'm over seas it would have cost me more so had to take it to the tailor......
5,Another Side of Satie,"Norman Lebrecht observes that Virgil Thomson considered Satie the most original mind in modern music, and laments that he applied his gifts so inconsistently. This collection may engender the opposite conclusion, that Satie could have been a great humorist, had he not devoted so much time to musical composition. Included here are the instructions to performers that Satie forbade sharing with the audience, although, unfortunately, the individual piece to which each one applies is not specified. Several essays, notably ""The Musician's Day,"" straddle the line between satire and surrealism. Overall, the collection adds a dimension to Satie beyond his music. Somewhat disturbing are the samples of ""advertisements"" that reveal an obsession with adolescent interests - castles, sorcerers, and aircraft."
4,Still a good show,I used to watch every week when it was on once a week. I forgot how much inner-office stuff that went on I guess I am older and prefer more police work type stuff but it still a good watch.
5,Very pleased,I bought this as a gift.. not only was a pleased at the price but it shipped so fast. My husband loved it!!!
2,Outdated and statistically inaccurate,"When this book was at first published, it was revolutionary. Following the female version, it showed men's oppinions about sexuality in a way that had never been discussed before. For people living in the nineties, just a small portion of the book remains interesting. Besides its obsolence, The Hite Report on Male Sexuality is statistically inaccurate, for it was proved that the choice of those 7000 men had a flawed criteria. The author based the research upon forms published in magazines she received. The result is that there's an abnormal concentration of men with sexual problems, causing a distortion in the result. Its historical importance, nevertheless, still remains, and that should be one's only reason to buy it."
4,Timeless data,"Whether the study was accurate enough or not, a lot of data in this book is still valuable. A great amount of men spoke out to a woman who knows how to interpret and how to write. Certainly during the time she wrote it, people were more loyal to any kind of study than nowadays, so you can't just say this book is only a nice thing to have on your shelves (referring to the review of the anonymous man from Argentina here below). It is not fair to state things are inaccurate and proven without mentioning the full (traceable) resources. In the book you can also see she has had many interviews with a lot of men. I still think Shere Hite has managed to collect valuable, timeless data."
1,too salty and ham taste,first time tryer but it was tooooo salty and also had a very heavy ham taste. I love ham but this was to much.
5,Great watch,I tend to break watches due to playing various sports. This watch holds up excellent and has great battery life.
4,It's a must,"Don't let a single critic persuade you not to buy this collection. I just bought the CD and as a Yes fan for 25 years, it is awesome. Hidden is the big medley which includes Time and a Word, Long Distance Runaround, Survival, The Fish, Perpetual Change and Soon. All tracks are great. Great Yes stories from fans and famous musicians in the booklet. If Yes moves your soul in the respect that you can't breath during certain songs, such as ""Soon"" or ""America"" do yourself a favor and buy this collection.D. Swany"
5,Nice tool,"This masher has lovely and efficient grip. It is functional, and looks and feel sturdy. Seems like a good quality product. Quite rarity these days."
2,Not even close to stated dimensions,"I ordered this masher specifically because it was the largest one I could find based on the product description. I make large batches of mashed potatoes over the holidays and mash them in a deep pot, so the fact that this masher would be two inches longer than any that I could find in the store was the deciding issue. Imagine my surprise when I opened the package to find that it is actually shorter than the cheap one with the loose handle that it was bought to replace!for anyone interested in actually getting a large masher, please be advised that this masher is not, as stated under Product Details:Product Dimensions: 12.9 x 4.6 x 3.5 inchesIn fact it is about 10.9 x 3.75 x 3.6 inchesSort of makes me wonder what they actually measured, if anything.I am so disappointed and angry that I feel like giving this the lowest possible rating, but in fact it is a well designed implement, and is larger than most."
3,disapointing,"My son got this as a gift. He was very excited about it and so were we - until we realized that there is no ""off"" button. It turns itself off after a short time. The batteries run out very quickly. It also doesn't always play the cd. The mechanics must not be very good. The cord for the microphone is fairly short so when our son moved too much the cd player would tip over and the cd would stop playing. It seems like it should be very durable on the outside but the electronics inside are so poorly made that our son hardly uses it and we haven't needed it to be durable. It has sat in the closet for most of the year. I did notice a 1-888 number to call to order an adaptor so it can be plugged into an outlet. We'll try that out if it isn't too $$$. DOn't want to spend to much on a toy that may or may not be worth it. If you buy it I would recommend the adaptor if you don't want to be changing batteries constantly. It would be best for a child at least 4 years old."
4,Must Have If You Own An AR-15,"Good book with very good information. I still haven't found the ""ONE"" M-16/AR-15 book but this goes on the shelf. I'd like to have seen parts guides & photos in color. I would encourage the author to contact and talk to some of the Bravo 1/9 Marines who were on Operation Buffalo with regard to his downplaying the problems with early M-16s in Vietnam."
1,"Antigone, a strange portrayal of a sister","This version of the Greek tragedy, Antigone, is inappropriate for sophomore high school students. The actress acts out suggestive movements toward Polyneices, yes, the dead guy, and her sister, Ismene while a narrator reads the story. Since I opened the movie, this poor teacher cannot get her money back. I am disgusted. There is no room for suggestive, lewd behavior in this story line."
5,Gripping Look at WW2 Submarine Warfare,"I picked up this book after seeing a recommendation over at the SubSim gaming forums. Being a fan of the Silent Hunter 4 submarine simulation game, I wanted to learn more about how submarine warfare really was in World War 2. Needless to say, hearing the stories from someone who was really there is incredible.Edward Beach does a great job of describing life on a submarine. Everything from the utter boredom of fruitless patrols to the sheer terror of being depth charged by multiple enemy destroyers is here. I particularly like how the book is divided up. Every other chapter talks about a particular ship's triumphs or tragedies, while the chapters in between discuss the USS Trigger, a ship on which Mr. Beach spent a great deal of time.If you like World War 2 history, and you want to learn more about US submarine warfare during that time, this book is for you. It's a book that I found very hard to put down."
2,"Good Period Piece, Not Much Battle Action","If you are looking for a book with a ""feel"" for being a member of Wellington's army in Spain and later Belgium for the Battle of Waterloo, this is your book. If you are looking for sabre slashing, pistol shooting action from horseback this is NOT your book. Coronet Matthew Hervey does see immediate action in the book, cutting a battery of French horse artillery to pieces in a dashing attack. Shortly after that Boney capitulates and the 6th Light Dragoons are shipped back to Blighty and then on to Ireland to help serve warrants and evict tenants. Hervey finds his future mate and then the unit is rushed to Belgium. Anchoring Wellington's right flank their job is to stay in place and prevent the French from turning the British right flank. Not a bad book but I like lots of action and this simply does not have it."
4,The best game!,"This is a really fun game, but it does have a few problems. 1 no multiplayer and 2 only ok graphics. Other than that it is pretty good."
4,Fantabulous Film,"Like most others, I heard of Open House through Anthony Rapp. I didn't bother to rent it, I just bought it because I've never seen Anthony involved in anything that wasn't worth my while. Within 24 hours of getting the film in the mail, I'd already watched it three times. Of course, not all the singing voices are 'fantabulous' but I do have to say I'm in love with Rapp's and Sally Kellerman's vocals. The film has a great humor to it, and a fun tone. The songs are extremely catchy -- you can find me singing Fantabulous all over the place. The film may take some getting used to for those who aren't used to viewing low budget movies, but definitely give it a chance. Open House has become one of my favorites, and I'd definitely recommend it to anyone who is in the mood for a fun film."
1,C Grade Movie,C grade filming and definitely not Grease... More odd and strange than comical... Watched it once and that will be it.
4,"Great book, but . . . .","Excellent book that covers what it says it covers--the 1903 SERVICE rifle. It would have been helpful to have information about the Springfield 1903 NRA/NBA Sporter as well as the Springfield 1922, M1 and M2 training rifles. Brophys book is the bible of the 1903 rifle but this book should also be on your shelf!"
3,Bikini Zone After Shave,"This product is ok... not the best I have used but not the worst. It is alittle runny and does not seem to last very long, but it does keep the irratation down."
3,The doll comes with this!!!,"I don't see why people would purchase this! I disagree with the reviewer below me because the food IS a little slimy but it's not THAT bad! But the doll comes with these accessories! I suppose it would be a good purchase if you had lost the feeding bowl and spoon and used all the feeding sachets. The bib is useful, though! I would say, SAVE YOUR MONEY! But it is VERY durable and I suppose it is educational because it teaches you feeding and I suppose it would be quite fun! Ah, I see why you would get this! If you got 2 dolls! So, get this is you ran out of sachets and lost the bowl and spoon or want MORE accessories or have 2 dolls but if you want DIFFERENT accessories this toy would be a MAJOR dissapointment!You have just read a review written by a 9 year old girl who loves her BABY born that she called Hermione!Something I would like to say:My brother is called Reuben and he is ADORABLE! He is sweet and cute and fun to play with!!! JUST LIKE BABY BORN!"
5,Best fantasy series ever,"Ignore the cover art, which has nothing to do with the book. The further adventures of Teleri, Ceilyn and some of his cousins. This marvelous trilogy is to contemporary, lumbering epics as song is to speach. The only possible comparison is to Rosemary Edgehill's abandoned series about elfland, and Edgerton actually finishes her projects."
2,Disappointing,"This book, based on the five issue miniseries starts off promising, with great Templesmith (30 days of Night) art and an intelligent story about a therapist and a disturbed patient who travel to the town of Silent Hill.However, at chapter three, the story and Templesmith are both abruptly discarded. New artist Salman takes over. He has an interesting artistic style, but the difference in the artistic style is jarring. It is also hard to follow the story from the artwork. Moreover the direction the new story takes, about a biker chick who practices witchcraft, doesn't make sense with what came before it.Why didn't this book stay with the same artist and the same story?"
5,Courage to create builds confidence,"I found Courage to Create very helpful in becoming more confident at trusting the creative process. I am a graduate student in fine arts and sometimes artists sit and wait or have a lot of anxiety about the creative process. One of May's definitions of courage is having the courage to deal with anxiety. May also states that you can not force creativity but you can force the work. If you work hard enough the work combined with your unconscious will produced creativity, your own original thought. I have found this to work and have become more confident in trusting the process. I am not a humanist, and you need to read this book critically and not allow humanist thinking to get a root if you are a person of faith."
4,a eye-opening must-read!!,"I bought this book recently and read it from cover to cover in 2 sittings.I highly recommend it. If I knew anyone who wanted to be a theatre performer, I would definitely BUY him/her this book.As a theatre fan, the book was an eye-opener and left me somewhat sad. It was especially interesting reading the contributions of Jason Alexander and Antonio Banderas.Most of the shows mentioned were musicals. Very little mention of straight plays. Thus the 4 stars instead of 5. But that's just a minor quibble."
4,Nice Case,"This case is pretty high quality compared to other laptop cases I've came across before. Fit and finish is pretty nice and it has a decent amount of room for papers, pens, batteries, etc. It fits my 17 inch Sony Vaio AR 230G perfectly. I would have gave it a five if the combination locks didn't give me trouble when I first set the combination. Other than that minor problem which was my own stupidity in action this is a great, strong, durable laptop case."
2,Not as tough it seems,"I bought this case three months ago and it has not proven to be that tough. Within a week, the top lid sides did not meet properly so that you had to spend a few minutes fiddling with it. Then, three weeks ago, one of the locking clasps fell off between leaving my plane and leaving the airport. So far the manufacturer has not stepped up with a new one or an offer to repair it FOC. I should add that it has been on THREE plane trips and has never been placed in the checked baggage section."
4,I don't think it's all that bad.......,"Despite being a little less funny then the other Marx movies,I still don't think it's as bad as most people say it is. 'Lydia, the tattoed Lady' is my favourite song sung by Groucho, the badge sequence is funny, as is the scene when Chico and Harpo are searching the Srong Man's room for the money. What about the funny part with Groucho on the ceiling? And I won't reveal too much, but I loved the ending. However, the undisputed funniest part of them all is when Groucho, Chico and Harpo are in the midget's room, this part had me rolling on the floor with laughter. Come on ..... give this movie a chance."
4,ok book,"I didn't think this book was so good. It was only ok. Mallory has to baby-sit for twins. The twins wear the same things, share a room, ( they even have the same stuff) In the end The twin realize that they need their own space. If you are a Mallory fan.... you should read this book."
5,A great Collection of there 70's stuff,"but the titles below are a different act all together.this Compilation has many of the same songs from there Volume 1 Greatest Hits&OTHER CUTS.FOR THE BEGINNING EWF Fan this is a Cool Start ""Got to get you into my life""""After the Love has gone"" among others.EWF were truly the feel Good Group the 70's keeping that SLy&The Family Stone Vibe going."
4,THE MOUTH HAS SOME GOOD THINGS TO SAY,THIS IS A VERY ENTERTANING BOOK BY FORMER SINGER AND WRESTLING MANAGER JIMMY HART. HE HAS SOME GOOD STORIES ABOUT BOTH OF HIS CAREERS. I ALWAYS FOUND HIM TO BE VERY FUNNY AND ONE OF MY FAVORITES IN THE WACKY WORLD OF PRO WRESTLING. HIS TALES OF BEING ON THE ROAD AND HOW HE SUSTAINED VARIOUS INJURIES IS ESPECIALLY INTERESTING. ALL IN ALL I RECOMMEND THIS BOOK FOR ALL FANS OF PRO WRESTLING. EASY TO READ AND ENJOYABLE.
3,"Great performance, poor video quality.","I enjoyed the performances on this video. Ella performs with the mastery of a veteran. However, be aware that the video quality is not the best, being shot using 70's video technology. Also, the title implies that she performs with Count Basie, but it actually is the Count Basie Orchestra sans Basie."
1,Minolta Dimage 7Hi waste of money,"I purchased my Minolta two years ago. After about 1 year the flash housing came apart, and now the camera's EVF and LCD displays went completely black (no images displayed). The same has happened to Mad Max's camera - read his review. The charge to repair is in excess of $ 350.00. I would dump the camera but don't want to contaminate the land fill."
2,Reliability leaves something to be desired,"I purchased my Minolta Dimage 7Hi new 2 years ago. Performance was fine up until two weeks ago when the camera's EVF and LCD displays went completely black (no images displayed). Contacted Sony (where you now have to go for Minolta service) as instructed and found that the base flat rate for repair was $211 plus $22 shipping. They got me once, but they won't get me twice!MadMax"
2,Poor workmanship and terrible customer service,"I would warn anyone of buying any minolta digital camera if they are at all concerned about manufacturing quality and customer service. I bought a Dimage 7hi nine months ago and had several rubber pieces fall off within the 1st two months. One of these was the surface for the manual zoom function on the lens. When this came off and allowed dust into the underlying plastic mechanism (yes plastic!), the plastic piece broke rendering the zoom lens useless.When I sent this to Minolta, they told me they would not honor the warranty because the camera had been ""used a lot."" In fact, they wouldn't even acknowledge poor workmanship for the rubber piece and charged me repair cost for the whole thing minus 30%. Please let your readers know what they are getting into if they buy a minolta product...as for me, I will never buy one again!"
1,Great camera - lousy assembly / quality control,"This is a wonderful camera that produces extremely high-quality photographs [ images] and is easy to use. The problem is that the quality control is inadequate. The USB connection on the camera was installed improperly and was wobbly and loose from the get-go. It functioned, so I worked with it, but it eventually failed completely after just over 30 days of use.Without that connection, the camera is useless. For this reason and even though the camera is a terrific unit, I would have to advise the purchase of something that provides a bit more reliability in everyday use. This is a $$$ item that functioned for just over one month. Not good."
5,maple syrup,I ordered this product to boil down sap into maple syrup. We tap a few maples and at a 40 to1 ratio weuaually use a pan that firs the stove and boil down abour 40 pints of sap at one ttime to produce one pintof delicious maple syrup. Lots of fun and just what we needed for the job.
2,ZZZZZZ!,"I love Charlotte Gainsborough, but this movie was not only way too slow and drawn out as French movies often are, but also surprisingly very commonplace! The plot could've easily been taken from any run of the mill American B-movie or made-for-TV movie, there was nothing even particularly ""French"" about it other than the fact that it's set in Paris and the characters speak French, other than the usual fits of French hyper/melodrama here and there.Normally I enjoy European cinema, but this one made me long for a nice Tarantino movie..."
4,My wife is a very good actress,"For me, this movie was very funny.I am a really big fan on Charlotte's work. So i probably am biased. But then it is only my opinion, and everyone has their opinions in which we must accept.i thought the plot was good. The way Yvan became jelous of his wife and all the episodes that made him even more jelous and do his silly little things made me laugh a lot.I think people should just sit back and laugh. Don't try to get too much out of the movie. it's not going to change your life, just laugh and enjoy."
2,If You Liked Pretty Woman...,"Then you'd probably love this movie.Not much in terms of plot construction, vague character development and shoddy resolution. All in all it has the makings of a great Hollywood remake.Oh, but dig the train- they must have spent a fortune on first class tickets! (actually, I'm sure it was all studio shot except for the exterior scenes)"
2,Expensive cabinetry - big kitchens,"The biggest difficulty I had with this book is that nothing is standard. I guess that's the whole point. However the majority of the kitchens in this book require custom cabinetry. If you can do that yourself, you're in luck and this book is for you. However if you do not have a $30k budget for cabinetry to store your food and dishes then this book will do little to help you design your kitchen. The kitchens shown are mostly huge with a few exceptions and even the exceptions are using tens of thousands of dollars of custom cabinetry. If all you need are ideas of what is possible, browse through this book in a library or bookstore. If you need real life examples of what can be done with a small to medium size kitchen on the same size budget, forget this book. It won't help."
5,Adorable & durable,"I bought this for my 3 yr old daughter, and of course she loves it. She will be wearing it to ballet class next week. Ballerinas can have wings, why not? Pretty good quality, seems like it will last at least until she grows out of it. The head band actually stays in her hair too & is soft & comfy. Would totally recommend to any toddler girl!"
4,nice towels,I did not get to see these towels personally. I bought them for someone in Texas and I live in Germany. I did ask how she liked them and she said they were nice.
1,WOW never thought amazon will sell a bad product...,First off this is my first review of hundreds of orders I made with amazon in my years. This towel does not absorb at all. After first wash it was coming apart ... Now i have to wonder what amazon is doing about quality control. =(
2,poor quality of towels,"After only the first washing, the binding/seam on one side of 2 towelsis already coming apart -- thread is coming out and seam is shredded.also, inside decorative hem is shredded in a couple of spots on one of the towels. Purchased Pike St 100% Egyptian cotton towel setPour Quality !!!"
3,FRAYED EDGES,"I WASHED THREE DOUBLE SETS OF TOWELS AFTER RECEIVING. THEY FLUFFED-UP NICELY; BUT, I FOUND THAT TWO OF THE TOWELS HAD UNRAVELLED AT THE EDGES. ALTHOUGH THEY ARE VERY ABSORBANT, THEY ARE NOT VERY STURDY. THAT TO ME WAS THE BIGGEST DISAPPOINTMENT. THE PRICE IS RIGHT; BUT, NOT THE PRODUCT!"
4,These towels were great... UNTIL,"These used to be my favorite towels. I bought several sets, in several colors. And it all came to an end when I went to visit my aunt and she had ""Hotel Collection"" towels. OMG! Go now and find some. These Pike Street towels are still great.... but for the guest bathroom! Plus, you can find these Hotel Collection towels for $6-7 each at your local Marshall's."
2,I Should Have Heeded Other Reviewers Warning,"I should have heeded my fellow reviewers warning. These towels are not absorbent. I received the towels Saturday and placed them in my bathroom Sunday morning. I noticed throughout the day that the towels remained damp. My household only includes two adults. Therefore, I can only imagine how a family of four would react to towels remaining wet/moist throughout the day after each hand washing cycle.Avoid these towels at all cost. I can only imagine the bacteria buildup that comes along with drying and re-drying your hands on these non-absorbent/damp everyday bath towels."
1,disappointed!,"As with the other reviewers, I've had the same experience. I was in need of towels & the Black Friday sale was just too good to pass up. Upon first inspection, I thought they'd be fluffier. Threw them in the laundry to wash before using. Well, they fluffed up nicely, but every bath towel, hand towel & wash rag had one edge that was badly frayed!Really disappointed in the quality...expected better from Amazon!"
1,Disappointed,I bouth these from the gold box special and ordered light blue. After I recieved shipment I ran these towels throught the wash (cold water + fabric softener) and they came out PURPLE! They are kind of soft but they are PURPLE! Probably the most disappointed I've ever been with anything from Amazon and I've been a prime member for at least three years.
3,a bit thick,"These towels absorb a lot of water and are soft, but I don't like how thick they are. You can't, like, wrap it around something and tuck it in itself to make it stay, it's so thick that it'd just come apart. I like the smaller ones more because I don't really have that problem with them, but it's still annoying that they would take up so much space in my drawer."
1,"Good material, but horribly made.","Every single towel began to frey at the edges or completely fall apart after the first washing, making this set worthless even for rags."
1,Guest Towels,These towels are not egyptian cotton. I threw them into the washing machine and they came out torn with strings loose. I was disappointed in the quality. I will be using them as guest towels.
2,You get what you pay for - they are not high end,"It is an outright lie to say that these towels retail for over $100. Only online can you lie so blatantly.The towels are fine and look much better once you have given them a wash, but they are no better than any towel set you can get at target in my opinion. It is not like you are getting ripped off at the $30 range, but you are certainly getting no deal."
3,Pike Street Towels,Pike Street Egyptian cotton towels are soft to the hand. For the price they are a very good bargain. I gave them to my daughter as a gift and she loves them.
3,Good but with flaws,"I bought a couple sets of these for my wife for Christmas and when we took them out they were in good shape. A few hours after them sitting on the table I looked very closely at the threading and one section was unraveling. I was disappointed but we kept it and it hasn't kept unraveling but I fear one day it will.This thing beads water and doesn't necessarily soak it in. It feels a lot different than some of the other towels we own. I am used to throwing a towel around me after getting out of the shower and having the water instantly get soaked in. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, the water doesn't dump all over the ground but it is a bit different. I would recommend this for a cheap set of towels and you won't be dissapointed if they get messed up after a little while since they are inexpensive."
5,Towels,"I was very pleased and surprised at the cost and quality of these towels. they are really great, and plan on getting more in the near future."
1,"Low grade towels, full loose threads","Bad quality / low grade towels, thin, full of flimsy material and loose threads / weaves. VERY different from advertised item in picture, even the color (Taupe) is so dark and dull. Very low end towels, I have just returned my order back."
2,Walmart or Target has better towels!!! Pay more for quality and not for this junk!!!,I needed these fast for guest and I expected thick towels that could last a while. I was greatly mistaken to have SUB-PAR towels which where and are a few steps down from target or walmart brand. If you need towels pay a little more or buy from a local store. Also the towel whilts and you will be wearing the color of the towels as well. TERRIBLE QUALITY!!!
1,Don't waste your money,"Shame on Amazon, these towels are not thick, not soft, very linty, coming apart on the first wash. I'm a guy, I don't return stuff bit these are crap."
2,Unravel,"The towels feel nice, but the washcloth and the hand towels are unraveling after only 4 months."
1,Really bad towel,It's like wiping off with polyester instead of cotton. The water stays on the surface and feels really cold. The Bianca towels are much better.
3,"Towel set is okay, but....","I had to let the whole bunch (4 of each size) soak in the washer for an hour, in hot water, for at least 2 washings before they became'thirsty' enough for drying well. I have no idea why this caliber of cotton wouldn't be good from the get-go...unless somebody pulled a fast one at the Mill. I've bought much cheaper towels that dried much better right off the bat so this is a real puzzle to me. I don't use dryer sheets at all for towels of any kind, so that's not a factor. They are all VERY plush, soft and a nice size. All of them are good for drying now, but be prepared to work for it by letting them soak for a while in the washer if you get these. Oh, and don't be expecting to like the bath cloths in this set very much. Even though they are a nice size too, I find the hem-finished outside edges very bulky and the border should be more toward the edge. All things considered, I doubt I will buy more of these."
5,Surprisingly good for the price!,"I purchased this set because of size, color choice, price, and free shipping offered. Reviews suggested it was adequate. I find it more than adequate. The towels came shrink-packed and I thought, ""Not thick, but they'll do."" Package directions say to wash and dry the towels before using (and to wash them together with nothing else). I did, and they fluffed up amazingly. Perhaps I got good results because my washer is cold water only and I use an enzyme detergent, but I find these to be thirsty towels that hold up well in use and after washings. I've not had the excessive lint or other problems some have mentioned. I've come to expect less than promised, but these towels exceed my expectations. They are a cheap way to freshen up a tired bathroom."
1,Avoid Purchasing these towels at any cost!,"These are without a doubt the poorest made towels of the lowest quality I've ever seen! I purchased 2 sets of these towels since they seemed to be a good price. They looked nice when they arrived - thick and cushy and they come in a variety of popular colors. I washed them 1 time before using and they shed so much that my dryter filter was clogged about 2 inches thick! Several of the towels now had threadbare spots and the edges of several others were so shredded that they were separating into strings and totally coming away from the body of the towels. I am returning these and will never purchase a Pike Street product again. Walmart towels are so much better than these it's hard to believe. I am sure that if Amazon was aware of the quality of these towels they would not allow them to be sold on their site, giving Amazon a bad reputation."
3,Thick and absorbent,"These towels were very thick, soft and plush. The color was exactly as the picture on my computer screen. However, when they get wet they become very heavy. A third of one side of one towel was frayed, but it was repaired and kept. Be prepared to need lots of drying time after washing."
3,"Good, bag broken, one towel dirty","It's a cheap set, but the presentation in pretty poor. I got a broken plastic bag with one of the sets, and, consequently one of the towels was dirty. But I couldn't be bothered to return the whole package just for that. Good value, now I have to see how they work after several washings."
2,Loose Fibers,Just two points.. the fibers come out and not as absorbent. You need to wash these a few times before they do not shed all over you and become somewhat more of a towel. Else it is good for the beach or just sitting on
3,A lot of sizing in these towels,"I've washed these towels 3 times, so far, and they still do not easily dry one. Hopefully, as I continue to wash them, they will improve their service. They are lush, beautiful, towels."
1,Poor quality,"I received these as a Christmas gift, and I was excited about it since I wanted nice quality towels. But after washing them once the sides unraveled on 3 of the towels. Pretty disappointed in this product. They are a nice weight, but I think they should have lasted for more than one wash."
2,"Decent enough for occasional guests, but not every day quality","Biggest gripe - the dye is not color-fast, so if you use any kind of medicated cleanser in the shower with benzoyl peroxide or the like, the towels will immediately develop discolored patches. Obviously, you can't use bleach either, though it's not clear why you'd want to. (If you use them long enough, the discolorations even out, giving a totally different solid color - but sometimes it's cool too.) The towels are reasonably soft, not especially absorbent, but they work well enough. Can't speak to durability, but given they're not color-fast, they are not first-line towels for me. Given the competitive price and comforting feel (if not amazing drying efficacy), they are a plausible choice for the guest bath, however."
3,Pike Street towels,The towels are heavy but too soft and not very absorbent at all. There was shrinkage after washing. The colors are nice and did not fade after washing.
3,Count on at least one defective towel.,"I ordered 2 sets of these (that's 12 items) and one bath towel unraveled at the edge after no uses and one washing. Also, my dryer screen was chock full of fuzz after the initial wash and dry using a HE washer and low heat on the dryer. This seems excessive to me and does not bode well for durability. The towels themselves are quite comfortable and attractive, but the quality is not up to what the description and 'suggested retail' price would imply."
2,Pike Street Towels a disappointment,"I purchased the Pike Street towels expecting a very high quality towel. When I received them in the mail, one towel was very poor quality. The edge which is a hemmed style edge was frayed and not sewn in several places. The hand towels several areas that were frayed and in poor condition. I was very disappointed."
1,Frayed after 1 wash,"I know these towels are inexpensive, but they became frayed after the first wash & dry. I used the cold washer setting and the lowest dryer heat setting. I would never buy this brand again. The only reason I bought them was due to high reviews which had never served me wrong before on Amazon..."
1,They look nice until you wash them!,"I purchased these towels on a whim, and when they arrived they looked and felt like they were very nice quality. When I washed them, the sides of the towels came apart and frayed to the point that I would not want to use them for anything but wiping up a spill. This purchase was very disappointing."
3,Pike Street Towels,"We bought these towel sets to replace some older Vera Wang towel sets. The bottom line is that they were thinner and less absorbant than the Vera Wangs which have had a number of years of use. Unfortunately we could not return the Pike Street sets because we had washed them. We, instead, gave them to our youngest son whose a needy theatre student in graduate school."
2,Extremely soft but useless for absorbtion,"I had purchased the same towels two years ago and we absolutely loved them. The set two years ago was 5 stars. When they were on special we purchased more. They are some of the softest towels we have ever owned but they are useless when it comes to drying your body or hands. After 20 washes in hot water they are marginally better, but beware, something is being used on the fibers to make the towels soft and it is preventing the cotton from holding the moisture.I would suggest that these make great show pieces in a guest bathroom that never get used, but I wouldn't want my guests to feel like they couldn't get dry after bathing."
2,Frayed when washed,"The towels arrived packaged nicely but when I washed them, all but one of the towels came out of the washing machine frayed! The texture is nice and fluffy but the edges are now frayed."
2,definitely not the best,"I actually like the texture of the towels, but they are so poorly made, that after the first wash the side seams were falling apart and I had to cut them in random spots to get all of the hangy bits off. I wouldn't buy them again. Spend a little extra and get quality."
2,Third purchase of this towel set - NOT the charm,"This is the third set of towels of this brand I have purchased from Amazon.com. I was quite pleased with the first two towel sets (which I purchased over the last couple of years), but this set is not of the same quality. Possibly, I just received a ""bad set"", but many of the edge seams came undone after just a couple of washes! The older towels are still holding up very well, but not this set. I can't explain the difference. I only hope this is not a trend for this brand. Personally, I can no longer recommend these towels."
2,Feel nice but fall apart at the stiching after first wash,"The towels are very soft to the touch however we had to return one of the shipments after the first wash as the stiching was coming off. Great price, soft towels but do not hold up well after washing."
1,Dissapointed,I purchased these towels after much searching and decided to take a gamble since there were mixed reviews. Big mistake. I received them today and washed them as per the directions prior to first use and now they are in tatters. The stitching along them hem was very poorly done and came apart requiring me to trim loose threads. Also the color completely faded even with being washed in cold water with color guard detergent. They look like I have had them for years and I haven't even used them yet. Waste of money and now my husband can tell me I told you so. =(
3,towels,"the towels had a flaw and thread was comming out, over all nice feeling towels and very absorbant, wasnt worth sending back but I feel they are 2nds"
5,Big and Thirsty,"These towels are huge! Even the washcloths and hand towels. They are soft and very absorbetent. The color is as pictured. I would recommend them because they are quality.*Edit* After several months of use, the color has begun to bleach and the towels are turning pink. I was wash them per manufacturer's instructions. Maybe they're not as great as I thought!"
1,NON-Absorbant Towels,"Like other reviewers wrote, these towels do NOT absorb water. They ARE big, fluffy, heavy, soft towels that seem like they will be very comfortable. But the water stays on the surface of the towel and feels very cold when you are trying to dry yourself off. We washed them about four times, but this did not help.Are these really 100% Egyptian cotton, because they seem like they're polyester."
1,Bad Quality and Dries as if it is a chamois,"I have never seen a towel disintegrate as quickly as this set did. I put the towels in the washing machine (front loader) on normal cycle and dried them on gentle before using them. After using the wash cloth and bath towel one time each began unraveling on one side. The towels appeared very thin upon arrival until I laundered them which ""plumped"" them up and that was a pleasant surprise but when drying myself off they weren't absorbent, it felt like the water was being pushed off me. Reviews said they were good, which is why I purchased them, but I can't recommend them. That's only my opinion."
1,"Soft, not absorbent.",Bought three sets of towels because of the great deal... you get what you pay for. Cloth came apart at the seams after one washing. Nice and soft but no absorbency. Felt like I was just pushing water from one place to another. Returned two of the unused sets for a refund.
2,Sheds like a ldog at the equator!,"We washed the towels when we first received them. Have never seen an item ""shed"" so much. They have been used and washed for the third time and they are still ""shedding"" though it appears to be less and less with each washing. We like the size and the feel of the towels but we are disappointed in the towels and would not buy this brand again."
1,Bad manufacturing !!,All of the towells that came on the package started unravelling on the edges. The company should try to check for quality standards before shipping them out to customers! Buy at your own risk!
5,Such a deal!,I had already bought 2 sets of these towels in ivory? cream? They are large and very absorbent! They do get softer the more they're washed as I had seen a reviewer mention before. I liked them so much I bought another double set. I am on fixed income (very low) so I can't afford to spend a lot. For the money these towels are the best deal around!
3,A very average towel,"Did not live to expectations, it's not that soft, does not absorb well, and is getting worse with time. Looks much better on the picture than in real life."
2,Low Heat!?,Products starts to come apart in normal Heat in Dryer. I can get a towel from Target that will last many high heat cycles and costs the same. Terrible Craftmanship! It does feel very plush though.
3,Ordered two of same color and not even close,"I ordered two thinking I wouldn't have to worry about matching with previously ordered product or existing towels. The two sets arrived and color aren't even close to the same color. One is a fairly mundane blue, the other lavender/purplish. I'll just keep them in different bathrooms for now but I'm REAL disappointed and will probably not order this brand again."
1,Poor Quality Towel - Non-Absorbent,"Why Amazon continues to sell these towels, I'll never know.I was attracted by the average 3.5 star rating, combined with a very attractive price & Free Super Saver shipping. Unfortunately, when I received these towels, the quality does not match the average rating (in my not so humble opinion).Right out of the package (and after the first washing), there are lots of loose threads - the towel looks ""sloppy.""As many other reviewers have written, these towels do not do what a towel is supposed to do. The DO NOT absorb water as you're trying to dry off after a bath or shower. As you wipe yourself dry, the towels feel cold & wet, rather than leaving you warm & dry. I'm sorry, but in terms of performance, these towels are very poor when compared with years-old, ratty cotton towels with holes in them. At east the ratty towels leave you warm & dry after a shower.Very disappointing - not at all recommended."
1,Quality Very Poor,"Not even worth the sale price of $30! Strings are coming out of all the hems. I didn't even use them, returned for full refund. Target and JCPenney's have better towels. Don't waist your money on this one."
4,One of the most underrated Rick's solo album,"I'm surprised: too often people here give 5 stars, which means ""masterpiece"", to really weak albums, and here they gave this very solid album just 2 stars!?If you are crazy about classic symphonic progressive rock, you probably will be a bit disappointed. Yes, it doesn't sound very similar to Rick's early solos, but hey, the 70th have gone!The disk sounds ""modern"" and thick with some heavy guitars. However, there are plenty of Risk's signature keyboard's passages to please his old fans. Production and sound quality is also very good. Damian Wilson is resposible for the great vocal parts on the album.Anyway, this is classic/progressive rock album of the year, and the forse is still with Rick, so don't hesitate to buy it! In my opinion, this album is Rick's most solid one sinse 1984!It's pity this work wasn't promoted very well and was unavailable in US as for import only!"
1,Text is often Inacurate or Outright Incorrect,"This text has a tendancy to give misleading information or entirely incorrect information. Even in the most basic concepts, the authors misuse terms or create terms used nowhere else in the IT industry. The authors relay their lack of understanding for basic computer concepts in this supposedly 2001 updated edition.As an example for those who are literate in IT, the authors make statements such as ""virtual memory is used only on larger computer systems"". Got a 6 year old computer running MS Windows? You've got virtual memory.If you wish to learn about IT, please find another book written by authors who understand the field, not business professors."
3,"Good concept, OK execution.","Played this game with friends last week... I like the concept a lot, but there are some flaws to the game.Generally speaking, the words are way too easy -- I think, in the 2 rounds we played with the game, there were only a handful of words that weren't gotten on the first try, and maybe one or two that weren't guessed in the second.Also, you have to listen to everything the hosts say -- if someone is talking over them, you've pretty much ruined that round (because you can't tell who is supposed to guess and who is supposed to give clues). Had they installed a volume control, I think this game's rating would have gone up a star.Lastly -- the background music track gets old very quickly. After a while, you don't notice it anymore, but at first, it sounds like a bad 1980s music video."
5,One of the most interesting adventure stories I've ever read,"Within the first hundred pages, the hero has gone to Spain to avenge his mother's murder, learned how to be a doctor, helped drug a girl about to be walled in a convent cellar, held prisoner on a slave ship, thrown overboard, and is shipwrecked in Aztec Mexico. It gets better from there. And yet the hero is such a nice man: a novelty these days in adventure stories."
2,"don't be ""con"" vinced into watching this",To be honest with you I thought the movie was really bad. the acting was ok but the only good part about the movie was that ricky (Rodney Eastman) was in the movie. (for about 5 mins) but i would not suggest renting this movie and waisting 4 dollars.
3,By no means Trungpa's best,"If you want to read a Trungpa book, I would suggest Cutting Through Spiritual Materialism or The Myth of Freedom. This book has a few good tidbits on the skandhas, but that's about it.The question-and-answer sections at the end of each chapter did nothing for me, Trungpa's style is not up to his usual standard of clarity and straightforwardness, and I got the strong sense that I was being given an extremely dumbed-down, Cliff's-notes version of Abhidharma/Abhidhamma.Worth borrowing, definitely, but not particularly worth buying."
5,Happy Finches,This is a tried and true product...aids in bird digestion. I have raised finches for years (some zebras have lived to be 12!) and I find that adding a bit of charcoal and hi-cal grit to the usual mix you can find in pet stores keeps my birds a lot healthier longer. Amazon seems to be the easiest place to find this product. Few animal stores stock it.
2,Ok,"I agree with: ""It doesn't seem to be something she wants to play with on her own.""But I flip the Kitty hoot around and they cats will chase it."
5,Racing Seat,This is one comfortable seat compared to the manufacturer's one. It was easy to install with the proper brackets. It provides great support.
1,WTF! ORDERED two!!! SEATs,"Both are driver side!Ones had some broken plastic on it! (UGLY)Seat seems to becoming apart and Im not even using them, im returning them!THESE ARE LOOK GOOD ONLY SEATSI NEED SEATS!CRAP!Would not suggest ordering, the seats are comfortable (for small medium people) but What THE HELL!Light colored grey, and not exactly as pictures (the recline is a handle.)"
1,"Not what I expected -- Flimsy, won't last long","I wanted a proxabrush holder that was strong and would last a long time, like my last one did. It was still working great after years of use -- I just wanted a newer one. The Butler Gum Proxabrush Handle is really flimsy and has a poor design. It doesn't even close tightly to hold the proxabrush in place, so I have to hold the closure while I'm using it. It's so flimsy, I think it will be bent out of shape before long. I did wonder why they sent six, since all you need is one good handle -- now I know. It is hard to find a good handle but it's worth looking around more. I don't recommend this one."
2,mediocre,"The family dynamics classifications are somewhat reasonable in that they will get people to think about the environment they are providing for their children. However, this book neglects to talk about how to handle the willfully defiant child, as if all children are born inherently good, selfless, rational, and with a sense of ethics. It also fails to recognize the various mental development stages that children go through such as concrete thinking. It incorrectly represents and then belittles James Dobson's stance that spanking can be effectively used on rare occasions as a method of discipline for 2-5 yr olds exhibiting willfully defiant behavior. There are many other books on child development and building childrens' self-esteem that I think are more credible."
2,Kids are Worth it; Giving your child the gift of inner discipline,The book had too many markings all over. it is distracting to concentrate on the topic I wanted to understand and my attention is constantly being pulled away because of the markings.
1,Unreliable,"Throughout the book the author does not treat the subject with honesty. A few readers may benefit, if they read carefully.Example 1. The author tells the reader:""Kids are worth it! I'm sure you believe this, too, because I know you're not in parenting for the money.""Presumptious! Has she checked ..., etc.Example 2. In chapter nine the author answers the question, what do you do when your child calls you from jail along these lines: You let him/her know that you support him/her, but you leave everything up to him/her, including paying for the lawyer, exercise your backbone, etc. Correct answer: You ask first, what happened! She makes it appear any child that is arrested is arrested for good reason."
3,Some wise advise but too schematic and disordered,"I write this review under the assumption that any parent who reads this book is because it is interested in the well being of his/her children, and indeed you will goo through a lot of common sense advise. However I deeply dislike the idea that families fall under no more that 3 categories designated as Jellyfish, Brickwall, and Backbone. Once you start to read the examples and compare them with your own experience as a kid, and now as a parent, must probably you will see that you have some attitudes that can be classified as backbone and others as Jellyfish and others as brickwall, so this makes those categories sort of useless to decide what type of family are you building. Therefore if you set aside that scheme as just follow the basic advice as who to nurture happiness and trust into the relationship with your kids you will find this book much more useful."
5,An excellent reference for what is the true modern vernacular,"Weasel Words: The Dictionary Of American Doublespeak is an impressive and encompassing collection of thoughts and descriptively accurate views of modern American word and phrase usage. As an excellent reference for what is the true modern vernacular, sayings and understanding of what modern society has twisted the American version of the English language to elaborate or avoid political incorrectness. Very strongly recommended, especially for all non-specialist general readers with an interest in modern politics, culture and linguistics."
2,Not worth the trouble of reading,"What I was expecting was a list of double speak terms and their definitions.What I got was a list of words with a bunch of biased opinions and allegations toward certain groups of people who may be in some way associated with those words.This book is not only politically offensive it's also outdated and in many places plain wrong.The definitions provided show a lack of research and a great deal of assumption.The book is a mish-mash of thrown together words, many of which are not even double speak. Many of the words are netisms and acronyms. Its lack of organization makes finding a particular word difficult.I was expecting words used in car commercials and medication adverts to be defined (words like ""customer cash"" and ""APR"" that are real doublespeak words), but they were not.This self-purported ""dictionary"" is nothing doing."
4,SLEEPER OF THE YEAR,"I am simply shocked by some of the reviews I've read here - obviously from ill-willed youths totally into so much of the crap music that overwhelms the pop/rock scene these days. This album is totally entertaining, pleasing, and shows talent and ability that I (and many of us) knew was apparent when they so eagerly boosted her off the show too early. These songs, along with her singing ability totally blows away some very popular artists - such as Britney and Jessica. Ayla may not be Katherine, but she shines with talent in my eyes, and even my 20-yr old daughter. I highly recommend this CD."
1,Just not good...,"Sorry...I am sure she is an OK basketball player. But this release is just stuff you've heard before by other 'pop artists' lately. It's nothing original, she has a pleasant enough voice...but its no more special than a million other wanna-be singers in the world. She had her 15 minutes...time to move on.Steve O."
3,just the right book for toilet reading. :),"The things that he has talked about are mostly common sense. Of course, if you don't observe, you won't know. And some of the samples are really just made up stories. And some of stories are not his observations; he must have spent quite some time watching those animal programs on TV.Each page has one sample, and very short. This is the right book for toilet reading. It is just an entertaining book when you are bored. You can't really learn how to run a business just by reading this simple book.This book also has some grammar mistakes."
4,One of the best fusion albums of the last 20 yrs.,"This is one of the best fusion albums to come out in the past twenty years. My only critism is that the synth's and electric guitar become a little to thick at times. Those of you who are die hard Chick Corea fans will love it. For people who have never listened to him before, this is a great place to start. Great compostions, and great players. As always Chick's incredible musicianship comes shining through all of the electronics. As for me though I still prefer hearing Chick Corea playing in an acoustic setting."
4,I put it to good use when we ...,"I put it to good use when we went on vacation. This Sunblock Lotion is creamy, goes on smooth, and doesn't feel really heavy. And, with SPF 45, I didn't have to worry about burning. However, the bottle states it won't clog pores -- but just like with any other sunblock, I experienced a small breakout on my chin while using it. Overall, a good product and I would use it again."
3,Children's Book,"I read it as a child and enjoyed it very much. Just reread for old times sake. As an adult, it did not appeal as much, but I will certainly recommend it to children I know."
5,great novella,"Shorter then i thought but a lot of fun and very ""Aesop-ess"" enjoyed the characterization and the short paragraphs were good for me as i read it while on the treadmill"
2,Painful and Scratchy,"When the nose screw came I absolutely loved how it looked! However when I tried to put it in, the end of the plastic screw was very scratchy and painful (enough to make my nose start bleeding from the tiny scrapes it gave me). I couldn't even get it in vey far without getting scraped. When I looked closer I saw that there was some scratchy plastic poking up out of the end. I even tried filing it down but it didn't help. It is such a shame because I really liked the looks of the cone but I can never actually wear it. This was my first time getting a bioplast nose screw but I think in the future I will stick to metal screws."
3,Easy to understand but not an in-depth review of specifics,"A very easy-to-read book with simple explanations and definitions. The underlying theme, however, is ""if you have concerns, have your child evaluated by a professional speech - language specialist"". There are resources in the back to help you find the specialist you may need. There are a few suggestions on things you can do to help your child if there is a speech or language problem."
3,Comic Wars,"First off Im a huge comic fan. I buy comics whenever I can to read and hope it would be one day be the next ""Amazing fantasy #15"". Now this movie shows the dark side of comic fandom. 2 rival comic shops fighting it out to be ones who recieve the mother of all comic collections.Now this movie was a little funny at times, but most of the characters are so vial that you dont really care about them. The plot was too predictable from begining to end, to the point that you knew what was going to happen many minutes ahead of time. Dont get me wrong, the storyline was good but everything else was ok at best. I would recomend this movie only if it wont cost you much."
1,Needs a Transfusion,"I'm a fan of Christine Feehan's Dark series and have read them all so I was eager to devour Dark Guardian. Unfortunately, Lucian and Jaxon's story is a major disappointment, especially when compared to its great predecessor, Dark Legend. In Legend, Lucian is a complex, even menacing character. In Guardian, he definitely pales but I must give him major brownie points for putting up with Jaxon's whining. The chemistry between Jaxon and Lucian is tepid, the plot is thin and the redundant dialogue quickly grows tiresome. Even the villain is weak. His maniacal behavior isn't adequately explained. This was a great opportunity to have an evil, frightening character which never materialized, and the final confrontation was a major letdown.Feehan usually hits the mark. Dark Guardian definitely needs a transfusion."
5,Dark series n.8,"Dark Guardian presents Lucien who for the last several hundred years has pretended to be a vampire in order to safeguard his brother, Gabriel. Lucien at Francesca's (Gabriel's lafemate) word, searches out Jaxon Montgomery, a cop who is haunted by an abusive step father. He had killed her family and foster family, and anyone else who he percieved as being a threat to his relationship with Jaxon (this being anyone she grows close to.) Jaxon is afraid for Lucien despite his tremendous abilities, fearing he will be overconfident that no human could be a threat to him. Lucien is determined to help Jaxon move beyond her past once he finds her.If you are new to Christine Feehan, I recommend you start with Dark Prince because these novels have an overarching storyline that holds them all together, and characters from earlier novels tend to pop up."
2,Sick of the silly women in these stories,"I adore this entire series and I have just finished Dark Guardian and I'm on to the next one. I have to say that I get a little annoyed by Jaxxon and all the women like her who are all ""Sex me Sex me"" but then two seconds later are like ""I want my freedom ya' BIG Jerk"" It frustrates me to no end.I loved Dark Legend and Aiden's story as well. I recommend these to everyone just maybe not so much Dark Guardian."
2,Not Great,"I'm not much of a mystery, but was taking a class on the mystery novel at school and this was one of the books assigned. Maybe it's me, but it's always seemed to me that the detective should be responsible for the resolution of the case. Not here. Everything turns out nicely without the detective actually having solved the case. Furthermore, Spring's prose didn't do much for me. Her paratactic sentences felt forced, rather than displaying natural speech rhythms.Not a satisfying read at all."
1,"Over-written, totally lacking in suspense","This book was SUCH a disappointment to me. I couldn't wait to finish it, and when I did I had to groan out loud. There is NO mystery here - just a stupid, boring story where the author spends endless, mind-numbing pages describing completely non-sensical ""tidbits"" about the heroine. Why must I read for 2 paragraphs about a bike ride she took as a child, or why she hates squirrels, or how her uncle kissed her? I skipped entire pages of this book because they were nothing but bizarre descriptions of things that were COMPLETELY irrelevant to the story. And, the story was so bad, it didn't make up for it. A waste of time."
3,An In-betweener...,"Yes, there is no doubt this artist or group was trying to capitalize on the monk-chant, ambient dance fad of the early 90's. Comparing Gala to Enigma is like comparing a Nissan Pathfinder to it's twin the Infinity QX4 SUV. In one package you get the standard amenities while in the other there are numerous refinements. However, for someone who is not that picky will enjoy either groups for the music in general itself and will not pull apart or lose sleep over which is better. Truth be known that when Enigma came out with their first cd they too were criticized for using sacred Gregorian chants without permission as well as using other samples or similar sounds from groups like Soul II Soul for the club-dance beats. Gala by no means cannot be held up to the high calibre of style and originality that Enigma encompasses. It still does not make the cd unbearable to listen to..."
5,I really liked this product a lot. They ...,I really liked this product a lot. They work great for keeping the nose from becoming sore and they're really strong as well. The Cold Care Ultra product is even better than the lotion type. It worked just as well to prevent my nose from getting sore. And you don't have to worry if you used them on the fly to wipe your glasses clean. Definitely switching to these. I give them a high 5 stars.
4,Tasty and great source of protein,"While stiring it into milk is not my recommendation, blending it into a smoothy gives it a good vanilla taste and increases the protein without increasing the carbs very much. Economical on Amazon too."
1,Horrible!,"This stuff is awful! I read most of the reviews beforehand and when I opened the canister (I have the vanilla flavor), it smells wonderful. I'd almost equate the smell to vanilla bean ice cream. But I've mixed it with water and milk and it always tastes SOUR. It's disgusting and impossible to choke down and now I can't return it as it has already been opened. Don't buy!"
5,I'm addicted to Grey's,"The picture is so clear and I love that I can watch whatever I want and where ever I amd I can entertain myself, I just love my Kindle Fire !!!!!!"
5,Great,Came in on time. It was what I wanted. Great price on the show. Please offer more at this price. I will buy.
2,I wouldn't be watching if not for season 1 & 2,"New viewers during this season must be thinking ""what's all the fuss""? Season 3 is definitely not as good as season 1 and 2 were. We saw some glimpses of melodrama toward the end of season 2 but season 3 gets worse. Lack of acting ability starts to appear especially on behalf of Izzy (while mourning Denny) and George (while mouring his loss). And if I see Meredith sigh and frown one more time I will scream! I'm sticking with it because I heard it gets better. Let's hope so. Meredith's 'drowning' is ridiculous. The kind of thing you'd see on All My Children NOT Grey's Anatomy."
4,captions & extra stuff,"I can't help it--I like this show, and I liked this season!! I have my usual complaints about the show captions not being what the actors say, but ALL of the extra stuff I watched (and I think I watched it all) was captioned. This is most appreciated!"
3,The begin of the end,"GA has lost what they had gained in previous seasons. The realistic dysfunctional relationships/lives takes an extreemly unrealistic turn which leaves this viewer not counting down the days until it returns from summer break like last year. If they continue on this path, they maybe have 2 seasons left. What the heck is up w/ the ferry boat????"
2,Another ensemble failure with occasional good episodes,"Grey's Anatomy had some stand out episodes in this season, with ""From a Whisper to a Scream"" and ""Some Kind of Miracle"". Unfortunately, while the writers were crafting these superb episodes, they apparently decided to wait to the last minute to write practically the rest of the season.Story arcs seem to drag on forever, like someone realized they needed nine episodes and decided to pad out three. Also, it always seems that with a large cast, you're always wanting the focus to be on certain characters and all that happens is that the focus is on the other ones. Sometimes Christina's mind games with Burke could get to be a little too much and all the time I'm wondering ""What about everyone else?""And don't even get me started on the ""finding a new chief"" plot. Just more filler."
5,Grey's Anatomy Will Have You Addicted!,All I can say is: I am so addicted to this show! I love all the extra neat stuff that is on the last DVD of each season. Thank you for a wonderful item!
4,It's in my CD player and it ain't coming out!!!!,"I've been waiting a long time for this record and the wait was well worth it. It rocks to the point of pure euphoria. Every song is another world of sonic wonder. My personal favorites, ""Zoom"" ""Ultra-Cool"" ""Rockstar"" ""La De Da"" Anyone who holds the true spirit of rock-n-roll will love this one. It's the pick me up record of the year. If I'm ever in a bad mood it brings me back where I need to be. Can't wait to see Flipp live. I've heard stories and I just can't wait. THANKS FLIPP I NEEDED THAT."
4,"Bad First Impression, Pretty Good Book","I must say, when I noticed that one of the five star reviews for this book was written by the PR firm that represents the author, I was a little put off. However, since the books in this category are slim pickings (selling IT products and services, and selling to management) I thought I'd give it a try. The book is good, but not great. I actually got more out of Bag the Elephant by Kaplan, but there may have been an unerlying bias from my knowledge of the misleading reviews here at the site.It is a good book and, if you haven't read anything in this vein, it will definitely give you some goo dinsights."
3,Tornado loses again,"I love this movie. Yup, it's lame and you find yourself wishing the tornado would win. It is just plain silly - supposed to take place in Oklahoma but you would find such great cornfields in Iowa maybe instead. The cow is just plain fun and we find ourselves looking forward to ""Cow."" The lines are weak and the characters pretty dorky but all in all, the movie, while it has absolutely no redeeming value, is fun to watch for its silliness. No person can run through a cornfield such as our heroes do and not get sliced to pieces by the sharp edges of the corn leaves. Every farm kid knows that. And the final scene in the barn with all those sharp edges hanging from the rafters... sigh. I can't imagine any farmer taking the time to hang stuff when there are all those blank walls... However, enough said, pop some corn and start the movie, suspend your disbelief and just enjoy the fun. Twenty years from now, ""Twister"" will be camp."
4,A very entertaining thrill-ride!!,"This ranks as one of the best disaster films out there. My other favorite is The Poseidon Adventure. And like Poseidon, Twister is not just about mother nature wreaking havoc. It's about the relationship between its two stars, Bill Paxton and Helen Hunt. There is some fun, witty banter between the two in the midst of all the chaos and some neat special effects. Also recommended is Rollercoaster, a 70's psychological thriller featuring a teenage Helen Hunt before she went on to earn her Oscar for As Good as it Gets. Great film and performances all around!"
4,"Ah, Twister....","LOL, this movie is on now, and the older I get, the cornier the movie gets. This movie is way Hollywood and it makes me laugh The effects are cheesy and the story is predictable. I didn't know a tornado provided the perfect backdrop for renewing an old flame </sarcasm>all in all, this movie is lame, but it helps pass the time."
1,The one star is for the tornado,"It would've gotten two stars if it had killed Helen Hunt and Bill Paxon when it had the chance. Look, the gist of this movie is that some intern in an effects studio was screwing around and created a very tornado-like image. Next thing you know, we have a movie. I sat through this train wreck of a film until I just couldn't stand it anymore. The acting is like an off night at a middle school production of ""Oklahoma"". I'll recommend you buy this DVD, because there's no satisfaction like throwing the box into a deep river from a moving car when you watch more than ten minutes of this digitized crap-o-rama."
1,"Unless it's remastered, don't be suprised if BR verson on older titles is only kinda better...","People, if it ain't remastered, it's only going to be a moderate improvement, compared to standard def, unless it animation or shot in high def already. You wanna' see spectacular, get Blade Runner special edition in Blue Ray...OMG...now that's something to see and WORTH!!!!! my dollars. I've yet to see anything made more than ten years ago come even close to that title. Twister is one of my all time favs that can be watched at least twice a year. I may get this in BR; but, that's an exception. As far as I'm concerned, the movie industry is only porting most of their products in to BR, without much concern about quality, to get more money in their pocket, knowing full well that the end result could be much...much better if they took the time to remaster each and EVERY title to maximize the end result. For what they are charging we fans, this should be standard practice."
1,An insult to the intelligence,"Another lousy summer flick, with lots of special effects and no script. Deeply offensive, and even plagiaristic. The movie steals elements from a National Geographic special about tornadoes. There is one scene in which the good guys vilify the bad guy (we know he is the villain because he drives a black shiny van -- so much for character development) because he sold out for money. He has left the true faith of tornado chasing and works for a big company for lots of money. Think about that. A film produced by Steven Spielberg, with a screenplay by Michael Crichton, that includes the most blatant example of Pepsi product-placement yet seen, explicitly condemns people who do things for money. Is this Self-Flagellating Guilt, or Sheer Hypocrisy? Three guesses, and the first two don't count."
3,A Disaster movie,"An Ok Movie to kill a couple of Hours. Not a Masterpiece, but for a disaster movie...."
4,Spectacular in effects; droopy in story,"What I loved about this hit is the effects. I myself attend college in Alabama and was caught in a tornado a few weeks ago. I have the scars on my head to show it, but after seeing this I knew what to expect to happen but I didn't think the thing would drop its ugly end just a few hundred feet from campus and slam me into a brick wall. However, this film is one of my favorites and my family loves it. I love the music and the soundtrack. But the story could use some work. I have yet to see a disaster film with a firm and solid story to equal the power of the special effects. ""TITANIC"" is the best one so far but even the script in that could use some polishing..."
2,Terrible Blu-Ray,"Lets see, where do I start? Color banding, poor contrast, heavy film grain, soft focus and a lackluster True HD soundtrack. Warner Brothers should have never put this out like this. I remember the original SD DVD as looking pretty darn good. Not the usual quality we expect from Warner Bros. I'm thinking they are in a hurry to rush this stuff out so keep an eye on reviews before buying. What irritates me is that this Blu-Ray release received decent reviews from trusted sources on the internet. I don't see how they could have possibly missed these serious flaws. After reading some of these reviews here, I see the consumers obviously have not missed them."
5,Twister,"If you like natural phenomenon, specifically tornadoes, this is the movie for you. Only ""Storm Stories"" on the Weather Channel comes closer to chasing storms. Good story."
2,I thought the director was Milton Bradley,"Right hand red, left foot green, Twister, yeah, Twister, from MB. TWISTER was about as silly and corny as my joke. Great effects, but by time they had the tractor-trailer caught up in the tornado, they may as well have thrown in Yankee Stadium. The dopey romance (Duh, will they get back together? Duh, I dunno.) interrupts the tension that may have been able to build. See TWISTER on cable, where it's worth the price."
5,Twister rocks :P,I own this Limited Edition Collector's Set and 'tis one of my Favorite Movies ever :P
2,You above me? It's not that great.,"I own Twister, and have owned it since its release. I do admit, it is rather creative with the special effects and all, but the story stunk! ""We can increase warning time to 15 minutes"" as Jo said, yeah right, 15 min. to spend at the TV and watch the whole warning gives the Tornado time to reach you. Did you notice the growling sounds they used for the twisters? With the first tornado they actually used a Camel's snort. Also with the water spouts, notice when they are watching the cow blow by them, that in the background they are really on a highway and another car passes them. And the ending? Who can survive an F5 tornado while being strapped down on some pipes? Nobody for goodness sake. They would have been torn to bits. Anyway, you'll notice the flaws once you buy the movie. But please, it's a total loss of money."
1,A COMPLETE JOKE,"ONE OF THE WORST MOVIES OF ALL TIME.Tornados and humans chasing after each other... it quickly becomes clear that the tornados are actually more intelligent than the humans.At least PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE was so stupid you could laugh at it. This movie is simply pathetic - save for the ""flying cow"" scene, there isn't even anything to laugh at.Total rubbish. I find it amazing that Michael Crichton had anything to do with this bomb; supposedely he co-wrote it with his then-fourth-wife - he probably let her write this stinker, and just put his name on it."
5,Satisfactory!,This item arrived rather quickly and earlier than expected. This is a Christmas gift to a friend. Item comes HIGHLY recommended. :)
3,Picture quality lacking,"For a blu-ray disc, the video quality wasn't as impressive as I expected it to be. I hope this isn't a standard the studios start doing, re-releasing a movie quickly just to make some money on it and not put some effort into the quality. The movie was as good as it ever was though, a fun movie to watch as always."
3,I hate Tornadoes...But I like this movie,"I first saw this movie with my brother when he rented it when it first came out and we liked it. I like the five tornado scenes.Even when things like cows, houses, cars, and trees are flying around makes the movie more exciting. The characters in the movie are okay for their roles only I don't get why the tornado catchers problems and marriages have to do with the movie. I found the beggining sad when the little girl lost her dad because of the twister. The reason for chasing the twister is so the tornado chasers can improve the tornado warning system.The movie went by smoothly and I still enjoy it. I would recommend renting it before buying."
2,"GREAT SPECIAL EFFECTS BONANZA, HOWEVER IT'S ACTING STUNK",I would only recommend TWISTER for it's action and effects not it's acting. BILL PAXTON and HELEN HUNT'S characters are pretty lame and uninteresting as is the rest of the cast I've seen better acting by grade-schoolers. The only real reason to see this movie is it's great effects which are awsome to say the least wait till the cast encounters a F-5 tornado. How big and fast it is I won't give away but that's the only reason to see this movie at all.
2,Twister had great sound and effects-period.,Twister gets a star for the best sound in a movie I have ever heard. Twister gets a star for some good special effects. Twister gets absolutely no stars for its actors/actresses (especially Helen Hunt) and its plot. That's all I have to say.
4,No Plot?,"Ok, I admit it. This movie is all about special effects, but for those of you who said it has no plot, you must have been watching a different movie. I understood the plot the first time I watched the film. It actually has several plots. There is the obvious love triangle, and then there is the race to be the first to test a new tornado observation technology, (Dorothy). There are also several sub plots which I will not go into. The bottom line is, this movie is fun to watch! It kept me, and everyone else I know on the edge of their seat! Being from Oklahoma where the film is set, it was even more interesting."
4,Good DVD Release of the Hit Movie,"I have had my copy for a couple of months and have watched it only 3 or 4 times. You would think with the digital encoding and improved sound, you would get a better effect. I gave this DVD 4 out of 5 stars only because I liked it the first go around."
3,I used to Like it.,"I used to like this movie when it came out in 1996. I thought the special effects were good and the storyline was good. As just in Independence Day, I found myself saying ""Why Did I ever like this movie?"" When I watched it again I found that most of the twisters looked fake and the story was really bad. Although it was still fine watching it sometimes, I get annoyed by the characters and how they acted to his fiancee. This was a movie of the times and does not age well as time passes."
3,Not a replacement for Lenny the lovey,"Was desperately looking for a replacement to my 1-year old's current lovey - named Lenny, naturally. This one (now named Kenny) is really quite nice and has lots of ""legs"" to chew, but whilst the little one does chew them, Kenny isn't competitive with Lenny.The toy is well made. Washes really well. My only comment is that the head is completely stuffed with padding so if you are anti-dryer or try to avoid wasting power then this lovey will not be for you (or you will need 2 so you can leave one to dry for days to ensure the head isn't wet)."
3,not too bad,"a little dissapointing, even though deneuve simmers beautifullyand everett holds his own.....not as god as previous version with malkovitch"
3,Interesting performance from Tracy saves this.,"An interesting performance from the always reliable Spencer Tracy makes up for some rather boring interludes in this over-padded version. Some reviewers accused Tracy of hamming it up but I think he projects the evilness of Hyde quite well. The film lingers too long on the out-of-date,hypocritical morality of the Victorian age and takes too long in getting on with the story. The 1932 version with Frederic March is probably the best one."
4,Be aware this older edition of the text,"With all the other superb reviews posted I'll get straight to the point. This volume, by BN Publishing, even though printed in 2008, is not the most current edition of Kirk's work. TCM was first published in 1953 and the 7th revised edition (still in print) was published by Regnery in 1985. BN should make plain that their text is a reprint of an older edition."
5,Conservatism explained in a historical perspective,"This is a must read for conservatives. The book contains a lot of references that can help us go deeper in the understanding of the idea of conservatism. Many great conservative authors are mentioned in this book, what helps us improve our conservative library. The book is very well written and gives us a historical perspective not taught in schools. The book educates us to better prepare ourselves in order to demonstrate the great characteristics of conservatism."
5,The Conservative Mind: From Burke to Eliot,This was by far the most informational book I have ever read on conservatism. I learned more about the history both the good and bad about conservatism. Also this book is very practicle and worthwhile. No hype just fact and purpose. Anybody who is a conservative should read this book so as to know the rich history we have and the future direction we are taking.To those who are not conservative or dont know if they are conservative please read this book. It is a book that should not be taken lightly. The very history and future direction of conservatism lies within its covers. A must have in every library. It is in mine.
1,Broken!,"Downloaded this to my Tivo (Premiere XL) last night and just went to watch it this morning. Audio and video are 20-30 seconds out of sync. Totally unwatchable. I can't comment on the actual content of the video because of this, and this does not necessarily reflect the other video formats."
4,From Latin to Kumbaya...,"This excellent mini-series about an Austrailian convent during the 1960's shows the momentous changes in the Roman Catholic Church in the years immediately following Vatican II. As other reviewers noted, the film tries to balanced but ends up being biased towards the 'liberal' side. However, at least it tries to understand 'conservative' reactions to the changes following Vatican II. Further, the 'liberal' side isn't served by its main champion, the insufferable Sister Catherine.Sadly, the changes we see the sisters excitedly adopting in the late 1960's were the end of convents like Sancto Spiritu."
4,Sister Madly,"For all you Russell Crowe faniacs (and must confess I'm guilty too), please be advised that he makes his relatively brief appearance as big bro Dominic during the second tape but don't let that keep you from watching this wonderful mini series in it's entirety. The unfolding stories portrayed within this extraordinary community of women will captivate."
5,A very useful survey,"Languages covered in depth are Alabama, Chickasaw, Choctaw, Creek, Caddo, Cherokee, Natchez, and Quapaw. The book also contains articles on the proto-Muskogean and the Muskogean language family in general, and there are brief entries on other linguistic topics like the Mobilian Trade Jargon and the ""Taensa language"" hoax."
3,Great looking-made like crap!,It is very nice looking-appears to be well constructed UNTILL you look underneath and the slats are particle board! My husband sat on it-He's not overly heavy-it cracked. We had it re-enforced with real wood and its better
3,Faux noir !,"Certainly one of Crawford's better efforts, it deserves a higher popularity than many of her others. I'm glad to see it now on DVD, but what marketing genius packaged it as ""film noir"" I wonder. Oh, I know that category will attract buyers who might otherwise ignore it, but it shows little knowledge or appreciation of the movie itself. Too bad, because this one deserves an audience based on it's own merits."
3,Not the best of Joan Crawford's work but worth watching!,The quality of this DVD is mediocre but very watchable and somewhat enjoyable. It is always difficult to unwrap FOX dvd titles; the spine is always left damaged. I have seen this movie several times. It's just OK. Watch for yourself and judge.
2,Not in my direction,"First, I am (was) a dedicated Spiritualized fan. Lazer Guided Melodies is one of my all-time favorites. Pure Phase ranks up there very high, as well. Ladies and Gentlemen definitely has its moments of brilliance as does Royal Albert Hall, but this very long awaited and anticipated release is a disappointment. I really want to like it but Spaceman is apparently heading in a direction that I'm not willing to follow. ""Out of Sight"" is the only song that resembles the Spiritualized that I love. ""Stop Your Crying"" becomes downright annoying. Perhaps my expectations were too high or maybe it's unfair to expect Spaceman to continue recording more of the same majestic beauty of the earlier years... Thank God for Sigur Ros."
4,To Buy or Not To Buy?,"Well I still haven't bought this album because I just started listening to Spiritualized after a long time. A long time ago I had decided I disliked them, but my mind is more open now, so I decided to listen to them, and I liked what I heard. Let It Come Down is a good CD, but the question is if It'll end up in the top or bottom of my CD collection. The CDs on here are a mixture of loud and soft, sad and joyful, and all with an element of gospel. I'd like a little more space rock in here, but I still love the album. The lyrics are really good, and I love ""Stop Your Crying."""
2,a disappointed fan,"I guess my problem is I keep waiting for another effort on par with LAZER GUIDED MELODIES, which is one of my all-time favorites. Unfortunately for me, each release of J.Spaceman's gets farther and farther away from my desire. For all the pomp and hype, like the album's warning ""Prepare to be blown away,"" you'd think LET IT COME DOWN would be a bit more trancendant. I find it boring, and almost tedious at times. Many of the tracks have an almost childish rhythm to them which quickly grows painful.I think it's sad that the best track on the disc is the SPACEMEN 3 cover of ""Lord Can You Hear Me?""I could probably like this disc more if I forced myself to, but I shouldn't have to. It should just be better."
1,"Rowentas are ""tee-tee"" irons","I have had one Rowenta iron, and that was enough. I call them ""tee-tee"" irons because the one I had peed (leaked) on my clothes every time that my husband and I used it.So, if you want an iron that leaks, or pees on your clothes, buy a Rowenta. If not, try a Euro Pro, especially one that has a steam station. Ours has lasted longer than any iron that we have had--YEARS."
1,Pseudo-scholarship of a very poor sort,"Mr. Puterbaugh seems more intent on maligning the true scholar in this area, Yale historian John Boswell, than on the proper pusuit of historical sources. He skims lightly over many quotes, approaches some true analysis, but always veers away at the last moment. While not quite as discursive as Clement of Alexandria, Puterbaugh is no ""sober historian"", the sobriquet he chooses for himself in the chapter on the deluded Clement. The publisher has seen fit to provide very generous interlineal space as well as a monstrous bottom margin, so don't be misled by the page count. This is a slim and worthless volume."
2,My God what a waste of money.,"Now, don't get me wrong, Decipher have never been a patch on Wizards of the Coast, but I've been very pleased with most of their Lord of the Rings Roleplaying Game books. It's mostly very high quality and very well presented. So what happened with the Hero's Journal? It's about 30 pages, very thin paperback... basically, it's nothing more than a notepad, and worthy about $2.99. Maybe if they provided three in the pack for more players I'd be happy (but still not with the quality)."
2,Not durable enough,"I have very thick hair, and used this brush at least once a day. After some months it started coming apart along one side, and now it isn't usable. [...]Worked well, but didn't last nearly as long as I expected it to."
5,The only brush I use,"I've been hooked on Denman brushes since I was a teenager (approaching 50 now...). The 7-row brush is the perfect all-around brush for medium to long hair. I've tried others, but always come back to Denman."
2,Disappointed!!!,"I have been buying Denman D-4 brushes since the '80's, and was VERY disappointed when I received this one. I can't tell it from a knock-off brand. The brush is light weight, and the bristles are stiff and hard. Not such a good deal when you don't get what you expect. Since they can no longer be found in stores, I guess I'll have to try another brand. I let the seller know, but got NO response."
3,Denman Brush,"I'm natural with type 4b/4c hair. I got the brush, modified it as I have seen on youtube. I gave it 3stars because am not yet sure how i feel about it. It does what it is intended to do which is detangle my hair, but I remain skeptical as to whether it is damaging my hair in the process. I have not noticed anything but it sounds harsh as it is going thru my hair. time will tell"
3,"Denman Cushion Brush Nylon Bristles, 9-Row","This brush wasn't what I expected. I expected it to make brushing my natural hair easier, but it did not. I was better off sticking with my trusty wide tooth comb. I took 4 rows out of the brush thinking that would help it move through my hair a bit easier but that didn't really help much.The only time it was easy, was in the shower after I conditioned and completely detangled my hair already. When doing that the rubber loosened and slipped off the handle.I now rarely use it, and when I do I brush my son's loosely curled mixed hair, but he prefers me to use a wide tooth comb because the brush, in his words: ""is too pokey."""
3,Not sure what to do with it,"Got it for my kids mainly 'cause it was on clearance. They could not really figure out how to use it even with my help. Music is poor, and instructions are not clear. Just buy normal TV or Game Console dance-pad, and you'd do much better!"
1,Moose Mountain - don't climb it!,"This is the second product by this company that I've tried. I don't think I'll by another. It is slightly better than the Dance Maker II I just brought home, because at least this one has music (if you can call it that). Both toys aren't fun in the least. They aren't reliable, don't ever give you the ""grade"" at the end of a dance (actually you aren't dancing, but stepping from lighted star to star like playing Simon), the batteries are ridiculously difficult to insert- I can't explain how awful this product is. Shame on the company for making it and Toys R Us for selling it. Don't leave your child in tears on Christmas morning. I knew I was returning it so I had three little girls come over and try it. They hated it too! ""BORING!"" they said."
2,Yet another misconceived sequel,"This sad sequel forgets the honest and genuine drama that was at the heart of the original film and replaces it with dopey, obvious jokes and contrived sentimentality. Mitch and Phil (Billy Crystal and Daniel Stern--Bruno Kirby is nowhere to be seen this time) team up with Mitch's brother (Jon Lovitz) and Curly's twin (Jack Palance) to locate a fortune in missing gold. Expect jokes about snakebites on the butt and half-witted locals as well as manufactured action sequences and sappy male bonding. Crystal desperately grimaces his way through his middle-aged-cute shtick. Forget this one and watch the original again instead."
3,Like Most Sequels,"Like most sequels, this movie was not as funny as the first one. It does have some funny moments and I would recommend it. But, of course, watch #1 first."
4,movie review,funny movie.we have seen it twice and have laughed all of the way through it even the second time....liked it...
5,Very Funny,"This was a great movie! I watched the first one because of my wife and I bought it just for the background story. If you only saw the first one, you're missing the best part. This movie was definitely better than the first one. I loved the fact that it was exactly as pictured down to the ""keep case"". I had it in a ""snap case"" and replaced it with this one."
4,It's ok...,"This bookbag was smaller than I thought. I do like the way it looks. I bought two- one for an 8th grader and the other for a 9th grader who has football practice. Since school has not started yet I don;t know how durable it is, but it is attractive. I do like the expansion folds on the inside and the side pop out pockets for water bottles. I hope there will be enough room for all of the books and practice clothes.Overall, very nice looking and a good value."
2,High Sierra Jackknife pack,"Light weight, extremely durable, This is the best feature. This bag carries alot. I carry 23 pounds everyday to and from work. Only down side - could use a smidge more padding on the shoulder pads, and a waist belt would not hurt either. This is the best pack I ever bought. Great Value! I have now retired my other 4 packs now. CORRECTION THIS IS 5 STARS not 2"
5,good bag,"This is a very good bag. Bought 1 for my daughter 1st, she carries 4 to 5 books in it everyday. I have yet to see a torn or worn seam.Bought 1 for my son who loves to drag his on the ground,after 3 months no sign of tearing. wish I ordered 4 at that price. now the price has increased."
1,Shockingly inept filmmaking,"I'm flat-out dumbstruck... I must be from a different planet. When I look back upon my life, the two hours I want back first are the 120 interminable minutes I spent watching 'The Imposters.' It is neither funny, clever, enjoyable or insightful. Its vaunted 'tribute' aspect - the take that it is a riff on the golden age of Hollywood - is highfalutin nonsense.Tucci did well and showed promise with 'Big Night.' How he got from there to 'The Imposters' (in one film!) is beyond comprehension. Maybe 'Big Night' was just the equivalent of a career .235 hitter suddenly hitting .320. Maybe 'The Imposters' was an anomaly and he can get his mojo back for the next one. Either way, there's a sense of career momentum stalled and opportunity squandered.I urge you not to waste your hard-earned dollars on this one."
4,Hats off to Mr. Tucci and friends,"Another impressive display from Stanley Tucci, who's recent acting and directorial (and in this case, screenwriting as well) efforts has earned him critical acclaim and a new legion of loyal fans. While not nearly as strong or satisfying as Big Night, the film is nevertheless far more entertaining than most of the ""comedies"" that have come out of Hollywood in recent years. A salute to the Golden Age of Hollywood's slapstick comedians (Laurel and Hardy, Chaplin, Keaton, et al.), The Imposters is a lighthearted treat for those who love the movies but constantly find themselves thinking, ""They just don't make'em like they used to."""
5,Dangerously funny!!!!,"Hat's off to Stanley Tucci for directing, writing, and starring in the most refreshingly original comedy I've seen since The Blues Brothers. This is a relentless character-driven comedy set in a timeless style reminiscent of the golden age of Hollywood. From the opening scene until the end of the credits this movie will hypnotize you with incredibly well timed physical comedy and perfectly delivered dialogue that lift the classicly esoteric situations to a new level of genius. This movie is not only well written but brilliantly realized by an incredible supporting cast including Billy Connely, Isabella Rosellini, Steve Buscemi and Campbell Scott."
5,A Must,"If you like dave grusin and chick corea and like me prefer more rock orientated jazz you must listen to this. With Vinnie Coluaita drumming for Grusin, and Weckl for Chick you drummers wont be dissapointed either. Includes the best version of Chicks 'Light years' I have heard with Daves kit sounding amazing (electronic tuned toms).'Rumble' is laughably good too!.All the Grusin classics like 'AM attitude' and some with Tom scott are all performed in a rocky/funky way with Ritnour adding to that feel with his trademark sound. Overall another brilliantly entertaining grp performance."
2,"Poor research, poor editing","We travelled all over the island for 13 days and found that Frommer's information is wrong way too often. Luquillo Beach is very comfortable for swimming, but, like most (or may be all) public beaches in PR closed on Mondays and Tuesdays. Parador Guajataca is a terrible place, except for the view. Some beaches described as ""one of the best"" are hardly accessible by 4WD. Many restaurants mentioned in the book are overpriced and many hotels overrated. The book does not mention that El Yunque forest is awfully crowded at the height of the season. I was surprised to find out that the book has been written by someone who lives in PR. The book seems to escape any editing, some sentences are repeated twice on the same pages. Unfortunately, I can't recommend anything better."
2,Side Effects,"Purchased Thyroid Support first part of January. It did help with mood, hair fallout, etc. However I developed acne followed by a severe case of acne rosacea, possibly due to side effects from ashwaganda and other herbs in the formula. I would love to keep taking it but am afraid to as it seems to have cost me a trip to a dermatologist at $175 plus a long future course of antibiotics. Any suggestions would be appreciated."
1,Illogical and moronic,"Reading this book will actually make you dumber. The author is using the old Ann Coulter formula: Shocking title, artwork that screams, and then bash the left with circumstantial evidence, red herrings, and logical leaps. If you don't believe me, try something simple. Grab a dictionary or get on to wikipedia. Look up ""liberalism,"" then look up ""fascism."" The 2 terms are mutually exclusive. The title of this book is contradictory. If you enjoy this book, I am willing to bet you voted for W...twice, and you have trouble spelling any word that contains more than one syllable. This author is banking on the fact that his audience is uninformed and gullible. Seeing that this book is averaging 4 stars, I would say ""spot on!"""
4,Enlightening but Somewhat Confusing,"This book is a real eye-opener regarding our past presidents and is a good critique of Barak Obama. For someone like me who does not have a comprehensive knowledge of history, it was confusing with all the terminology and ""isms."" It was somewhat difficult to keep them all straight...facism, nazism, pragmatism, socialism, progressivism and the similarities and differences between them...definitely not a fast, easy read. I still consider it worthwhile especially for someone who has not kept up with politics."
2,Facism,"This book was a very difficult read. Too much background and history about facism and comparisons to Nazism. I became confused trying to keep up with the writer and his views about facism, Nazism,Socialism and Communism. I don't recommend this book because it doesn't place enough emphasis on modern day examples of facism in our society today. People such as Barack Obama,socialist-communist-black liberation theologian, Rev. Jeremiah Wright, black liberation theologian,racist,propagandist, Rev. Lewis Farakahn, black Muslim, racist, Jew hater,etc. There are many modern day examples like these extremist people that should be reported about in this book."
1,Simply terrible!,"This right wing propaganda piece starts with an oxymoron (i.e., Liberal Fascism) and gets much worse from there. Goldberg has no credibility."
1,Twisting history to agree with his thesis,"The author is cherry picking and twisting history, but if you don't know the history you wouldn't realize that. Hitler and the Nazis were allied from the beginning with the right and with nationalists, who were represented by several different political parties at the time. They fought against the left, especially the SPD, which was the leading political party on the left. The author ignores that, because it doesn't agree with his thesis. Goebbels would be proud."
1,So biased that it is impossible to get to wanted facts,"I was genuinely interested in reading this, but he was so caught up with his fervor, talking points, and preconceived notions of reality that I couldn't get to the wonderfully researched history.His thesis relies on his own (rather uninteresting, though mildly creative) manipulation of semantics. At best his arguments are eye-rolling. More disgracefully, he completely discounts general historic attitudes that were pervasive across party lines.All in all, rather than being an informative piece, he just comes across as a condescending jerk who only loves the sound of his voice. The kind of guy that clears the room at a party."
1,Intellectual dishonesty,"One of the most intellectually dishonest books, and authors, on the shelves. Goldberg tosses around political science jargon with reckless abandon, obviously not really knowing what he's talking about. It's sad that people read inaccurate history based on conservative conspiracy theory and treat them as fact."
1,Anyone who takes this drivel seriously does not understand fascism or American liberalism!,"My title should explain it all. Goldberg is nothing more than a childish right-wing ideologue, who understand neither fascism, nor American liberalism, nor constructive political discourse. Anyone, who takes this book or its author seriously, understands neither fascism, nor American liberalism. The book is pure garbage."
3,"""Liberal Fascism"" and the Karl Rove approach",It does not surprise me that neocons are accusing Liberals of being fascists. It simply implies that neocons have recognized that they themselves are promoting fascism in government.One of Karl Rove's mantras is to accuse your opponent of your own worst failings.
1,Ridiculous Book,"Despite this book currently rating in the 36000th area of the book rankings, it manages to get the full internet sockpuppet treatment of the corporate funded right by garnering hundreds of positive reviews and reccomeneds. No doubt, from people that didn't buy the book it seems.Well, having heard Jonah explain the book in an interview all I can say is good luck to the dope that believes any word in this epic insult to modern human history. Speaking as a european, in no country - Italy, Germany - included would the assertion of this book be taken half seriously. In fact many would be insulted by its premise that facism is a left wing phenomenon.Which beggars the question - if Jonah Goldberg thinks everything evil is left wing and everything good is right wing then as a person, what kind of mental state must this man have?Shoddy. Poor. Unadulterated historical revisionism of the most heinous and in my opinion evil intention."
5,A new look at the twentieth century,The cute cartoon on the cover doesn't indicate the serious nature of this book. This is a great retelling of twentieth century world and American history. It includes detailed knowledge on many topics that historical/political observers only have an outline of.
1,No Doze Sleep Aid,"Let me begin by thanking the author for helping me with my insomnia. Between the Disneyfied historical revisionism he ""cherry picks"" with typical chubby boy smugness and the mind bending contortions he uses to develop relationships and correlations between actual fascism and the liberalism of his wildest nightmares I have never slept better. Two, three, four pages tops and I was snoozing.Thanks for providing the world with such eloquent scholarship. Banality thy name is Goldberg. I will close with an ironic thought. Fascism thrives in a society where intellectual pursuits are discouraged and where the masses are told what to think, do and say. This book will pander to the willfully ignorant masses who know nothing of history except that America is the greatest country ever!!!I am truly saddened that this is what passes for serious political analysis in America."
3,"""ism's and complexities"" too many words for simple thoughts","I'm only through the Woodrow Wilson chapter, about page 120...however, to this point I believe Goldberg is very, very smart but overstates what are simple thoughts with way too many ism's, quotes, and honestly, words. I believe it was Ferris Buehler who had something to say about ism's during his day off, if I recall correctly, he was quite right ""one should not believe in an ism, they should believe in themselves"" Goldberg, to this point, is really stating that people on the right (if we even know what directions are what after reading some of this book) believe in citizens helping themselves and accomplishing their goals without the government stating what their goals are. The left, believes in everyone providing for each other and a gurantee of some type of success, a collective society. So, you can't help people that don't want to help themsevles is what I believe. All other facts are just side notes, and historical proofs."
2,professor,"I was looking for a book to recommend to new adjuncts coming into our department. Unfortunately this book will not do. I felt that it lack content and specifics for execution. Maybe there isn't enough real information to write a book on this topic. Much of the ""information"" seemed to be fluff. I also got the feeling that some of the positive reviews for this book were written by the authors or by their friends. The language was too similar to that of the language used in the book. (Forgive the suspicious mind of a linguist)."
3,Geared for serious Paranoia gamers,"I know; ""serious paranoia"" is a bit of an oxymoron. What I mean by this, is that most of the contained missions are not quick, easy-to-run missions for the occasional Paranoia game session. Granted, there are several ""mini"" missions, but the majority are pretty heavy hitters; missions that will take both significant prep time (simply to digest all the information) and game time. If the members of your group are real Paranoia fans, then this is probably a good fit for you. If, however, you are looking for quick, easy-to-run missions for the occasional foray into Paranoia, you'd probably be better off with ""WMD"" or ""Crash Priority"".That said, all the ""classics"" are here; you certainly get a lot of content for your 40 bucks."
5,"Love it-- couple of cons, though","I do love this iron. It has made clothing that I had thought hopeless look like new again. The steam is ample & the narrow point at the front makes getting into tight places easy.As for cons:I wish that there was an effective way to wind the cord for storage. My old iron actually had an interior cord storage feature.It would also be nice if there were an on/off button.Still, I'm more than willing to put up with these little annoyances to have an iron that always gets the job done! A superior iron, especially for the price."
3,Works well!,"I purchased this iron about 4 years ago and last month it stopped heating. I sent it to the service center in NY and they said the repair would cost $110 (what a joke for a $80 iron). If your product is no longer under warranty, don't waste your time trying to repair it - Just buy a new iron.I like the iron, so I purchased a new one. If the same happens with the new purchase, I will switch to another brand. Good luck!"
2,Leaks,"I have owned this iron for 14 months. It began leaking recently and is now too leaky to iron with. I have used bottled spring water and been careful to take care of the iron according to the manual. This is not a quality iron that will last you. I would not recommend this to anyone.It gets two stars instead of one because when it did work properly, it was an excellent iron. It is just aggravating that this iron lasted 12 or 14 months and my last iron was a Target $29 special and lasted me ten years."
1,Leaks water all over!,"I bought this iron about six months ago. Recently, I noticed that my iron is sitting in a puddle of water in my cupboard every time I go to use it. I decided to do some searching online and I found that this must be a common problem with the Rowenta Focus. Today, I got my gumption up and called Rowenta's customer service number. I explained to the representative that I wasn't that crazy about mailing my iron to another state for repair because I need my iron. He rudely said, ""Well, what do you expect us to do?"" I was shocked! I hung up and am left sad and soggy. :o("
1,water and fire mixer,"I have a Rowenta DZ5080 iron that cost too much for a junk iron. For 6 months now it has leaked and spit water all over my clothes.(just google the name and read the reviews.) I am sorry to say I am far from alone with this problem.So far,I have not had the many fire problems as reported. The Mfg. has no cust.service so it seems. I plan to take my loss and throw this year old iron away before its too late. B. Taylor 11/15/10"
1,Rowenta Iron,I purchased this iron 2-6-2011. I have used it 3 or 4 times and this past week it would not turn on. I did all the things that the Rowenta website suggested and no luck it was not working. This Iron was a big disappointment. I purchased it due to the name and durability that I had heard about. Now all I can do is send it to a repair center. Rowenta website gives a list of places to contact. and of course none of them are in or around Iowa. I would not recommend this product to anyone.
1,Rejecting Rowenta,"I had heard of Rowenta irons some years ago and always felt that they were ""top of the line"" in irons. Thus, when I needed a new iron, I ordered the one from you. Much to my dismay, the iron did a very poor job of properly ironing linen clothing, of which I have a large amount, being a resident of New Orleans! Also, much to my chagrin, it SPAT water, even at high levels of heat.Thank you for your prompt service in handling this return...Diana Parham"
4,Rowenta DZ5080,"This is my second Rowenta iron and I am very pleased, so far. It makes all ironing tasks much faster and easier. I only hope at the price it lasts longer than my last one (3 years) . I used a $20.00 Black and Decker that is about 15 years old while waiiting for this to arrive, so I expect a longer life span for the price I paid for this Rowenta. One thing about this company is they used a special type screw to put their product together, so when I attempted to take my old one apart to try to find out if there was perhaps a loose wire, I found it could not be done without their unique screw driver head."
1,not impressed,"this iron is not all they say it is. the cord consistanly gets in the way when you set the iron upright, your fingers hit the temp dial because it is in the wrong place(not enough space from handle to dial), constantly refilling water. when low on water iron dies not iron as quickly it forces you to refill again... one full tank will allow you to iron two shirts. when done ironing if there is water left in tank it is difficult to empty. product not worth the $79.00 i paid. would not reccomend this product."
5,nice iron,I really like this iron as it is easy to use. The iron has good weight to it and my wife loves the constant steam and the shot of steam feature. It is easy to fill with water too.
4,ROWENTA - Best Irons I have ever owned.,"This is my third Rowenta Iron. The previous (2) were handed down to friends and they are both still working. The DZ5080 FOCUS is an outstanding Iron. A little on the pricey side, but well worth ever penny. The steaming function is phenomenal and best of all; the spout where you fill the iron with water is flawless. Unlike most other irons where you need pinpoint accuracy to fill the iron with water, this iron is a cinch! If you're looking for a new iron, look no further."
2,BAD BRAND - STAY AWAY,"I have the same problem with the Rowenta auto-shutoff as several other reviewers on amazon and elsewhere. Bought a Rowenta iron in Aug'07. The autoshutoff started kicking in even when the iron was in use. Suddenly during use, iron shuts off and red light begins to blink. Only way to restart - switch on and off OR bang it down hard sideways on the ironing board (""gentle sideways shaking"" recommended by the manual doesn't cut it). Then 15-20 seconds later - same problem.Returned and got a replacement in Sept'07. Autoshutoff broke again again in May'08.Out of 90 days return/replace policy - so seller won't return OR replace. Only option to send to Rowenta service center prepaid and wait for 2-3 weeks for it to come back.Better toss and buy a different brand. WITH extended warranty this time. Oh well... No more Rowenta EVER."
1,Terrible Iron,"I took a chance, spending a lot more than I normally would on an iron. I figured ""Made in Germany"" so it must be quality. Within a couple weeks, the ironing plate began to burn and although I have tried to clean it, it continues to happen. I don't know if the iron gets too hot, or the stainless steel plate is at fault, but i'm ironing standard cotton garments. Once the plate is burned, it can no longer go over clothes smoothly and leaves brown marks on clothing from the scorched plate. Additionally, the adjustment wheel is so loose, that you continuously hit it with your fingers while holding the iron - an annoyance, but not a deal breaker.Stick with a non-stick plate, and forget about Rowenta. Apparently Germany has lowered their standards..."
3,"from her reputation, i expected better","millay's collection of poems was not, in my opinion, a very good one. there were a dozen or so good poems (most of them from her collection _A Few Figs From Thistles_), but most were just not very good."
3,Not as good as The Inn at Lake Devine,"While I really enjoyed Elinor Lipman's Inn at Lake Devine - I felt that Isabel's Bed did not quite live up to my expectations. It got rave reviews so I was looking forward to reading it but it was slow going and once I got into it the book ended.Isabel's Bed is the story of Harriet Mahoney, a middle aged, recently jilted, unpublished writer who finds a job and a home with Isabel Krug - the ""other woman"" in a scandoulous murder. Isabel hires Harriet to ghost write her story.The novel is about their friendship and how it helps Harriet (and Isabel) put her life back on track.The book meandered for a while and finally got rolling about 100 pages or so before it ended. I guess if I am still interested in knowing what happens with these character's (which I definitely am) then I really did enjoy the book - I just wish that it had a bit more depth or about 50 more pages..."
4,A book with heart,"This is a book I find to be wonderfully layered with truth. On the surface it's a funny and light-hearted. But as you read deeper into the novel you find that it is more then just laughs and giggles. Isabel's Bed has a lot of heart and tells a good story. Harriet Mahoney comes to terms with her writing ability, her relationship with her X-boyfriend; she finds new friends and a new home. Through her struggles you see that it isn't necessary to write a published book or have a high paying job or a degree in a University to make you happy. You just have to find your own voice and live it out loud and that's what Harriet Mahoney did. It's really an enjoyable read and who can't help but love this book?"
3,a quick read that doesn't fill you up,"I enjoyed this book thoroughly for the first 100 pages. And I read the whole thing in less than a week of minutes grabbed here and there (that's fast for me). And while it was an easy and enjoyable read, I found it disappointing in the end. It never really takes off-- she sets up all these fascinating situations that are never fully explored or taken to their limits. As far as funny-- it was, but nowhere near say ""A Confederacy of Dunces"" or ""Thank You for Smoking."" A great airplane or beach book, but don't expect it to take you somewhere greater."
1,Ho Hum......,I am an assistant librarian and decided to read this book because we could not keep this one on the shelf and our patrons raved about it. It was a disappointment to me. Predictable and uninteresting.
4,Loose Heel,"I was really anxious to get these shoes. I wear a 7 w or 71/2 m. They did not have these sizes in the price I wanted so I ordered a 71/2 w. I thought with the strap they would not slip. I was wrong. There is no adjustment for the strap, and my right foot slips up and down at the heel. The left foot is okay, but roomy. I would not recommend going up a1/2 size, since this is essentally what I did. I am going to keep them and wear probably with socks. Really a good shoe, I just did not need a wide. The shoe is constructed well , and looks like it will really last!They have lots of cushioning in the shoe."
5,"Humorous, Intelligent and Fascinating","Kreeft, an academic with a reputation for orthodoxy and narrow Catholic conservatism, does a wonderful job in presenting a topic of great timely interest in a relatively (no pun intended) light-hearted way. I must say that I was thoroughly impressed by this work and would recommend it to anyone who finds his or herself on either side of the figurative fence created by today's culture and it's precarious - and sometimes adversarial - engagement of religious absolutism.Religious absolutism has gained, as Kreeft notes through the `interviews,' a rather polemical stigma in recent history. Closely tied to fundamental trends in the minds of many, absolutism is neither fundamental (in a pejorative sense) nor simplistic (in the idiotic sense). Kreeft does a fine job articulating that and helps to bring a refulgent tone to a formidable position.A page-turning synopsis of a timely philosophical topic."
1,Kubrick Would Have Done It Better,"The director of the piece of cinematic [garbage] clearly is of bad stock. Trying to capture the passion and magic of the art of yo'ing in one 46 minute volume is fruitless to the point of fruitacity, dare I say fruiticiousness. I've shot better odes to the Yo with my super 8, but I must never show them to anyone. The one saving grace is being available on VHS as opposed to DVD. VHS is clearly the format of choice of future film makers and bratty snobs like myself. DVD is simply inferior to even the simplest VCR that has been meticulously calibrated over course of several Summers alone staring at my knife collection. I must leave now, as I am the verge of crying."
2,Viturally No Instruction,It's about 45 min of these three people doing some cool yo-yo tricks to pretty bad music. They don't really expalin any tricks so basically it gets boring after about 2 minutes. Don't buy this tape if you are a beginner or intermediate and want to learn tricks. I think that maybe advanced yo-yo'ers might pick-up some ideas but in spite of not because of this tape.
4,Much better than Season 2,"I have watched Desperate Housewives from the beginning. I have to say that I was hooked from the first episode of the first season. However, in Season 2, I felt as though the series got too dark and almost too campy to be watched. However, this season, Season 3, returned to the camp without the creepy. Although there were a few misses, like the pedophile on the street - for the most part, Season 3 was a wonderful season filled with lots of twists and turns but still never veering into the completely inane. I enjoyed this set of DVDs and would recommend them to anyone looking to while away a few hours while watching a beautifully produced show."
2,Seasons of Desperate Housewives,Exactly as expected. Needed to get caught up on some of the story lines.
5,I loved the thickness and softness of these ...,I loved the thickness and softness of these tissues. I've put these on my list to continue to buy. They're wonderful!
3,Helpful,I found this book to be more of a help than the student solutions manual. It covers the material in the beginnings of the chapters (6-12 covered in this review) well and will help you check your work to make sure you are getting it right. It is sparse on the applied sections but does have hints and references to help you through the material.
4,Great series,"I love the Sopranos. I bought the first season just to see what it was like and got totally hooked. You really become emotionally involved with the characters, and find yourself rooting them on and looking down on the cops! It has such a great story line, even my mother who doesn't like mafia flicks got hooked. Everyone I know who has seen them, loves them. I can't wait for the fourth season! I miss my Tony!"
3,Hide and Seek misses the mark....,"I rated Ms. Adair's first book, Kiss and Tell four stars, her second effort here rates only three. I will give her top marks for hot sex scenes, she writes them steamy and wild. However it would have been nice if their motivations had been more believeable. It was a real stretch of imagination to have Kyle and Delanie doing all that they did and frankly, Delanie was quite annoying most of the time. This wasn't a bad effort but a bit of a disappointment after Ms. Adairs first book. Most of the humor that marked the first effort was missing here as well."
5,You Get What You Ask For,"When I first found out that Ms. Adair was coming out with a new book, I assumed that it was going to be on Huntington and Taylor, but I was pleasantly surprised when it actually turned out to be Kyle and Delanie. What I didn't really like though was the ending when it was apparent that both sides were hiding things from each other, but only Delanie had to go and practically ""beg"" Kyle to take her back. I didn't like this scenario. Both characters are strong and there should have been more of a mutual surrender. Overall, though, a great book with lots of steamy romance and ""spy king"" adventure. Still waiting for Huntington and Taylor!"
3,Interesting.,"I read the first one in this series called Kiss and Tell, could not sympathize with Marnie, and Jake for some reason I had trouble sympathizing with him as well. Kyle and Delainie, I could enjoy and let the story take me to the jungle. She was acting in the best interest for her sister and family, Kyle had always loved her and when they met again sparks flew. Also enjoyed the plot and how it took Kyle and Delainie to new heights of love and trust. Enjoyed the sex scenes as well. I'm so glad that in a way she dumped her family to be with Kyle and let him take care of her for a change. An all around exciting read. Is the next one good as well."
2,"Gets the job done, but not really a pro case","This case would be excellent for a student, but if you are looking for a case to hold a professional flute, look elsewhere"
1,No Baseball!!!!,"If you are looking for a good baseball movie. Don't see this movie.This movie is nothing but a bunch of sappy love scenes, one after another. So if you like a lot of romance and a very little bit of comedy then go to this movie but if you want baseball count this movie out."
1,Dog-Doo,"I can't begin to tell you how much I dislike Freddie Prinze Jr., he just doesn't deserve to be such a big star. This is a dismal waste of everyone's time and money. I took my friends' kids to see this and one of them summed it up on the way out: ""That movie made me want to take a dump."" I even bought her a malt as a reward for that astute comment!"
5,Summer Catch,I saw a preview screaning of the movie and I loved it! It's a great teen movie. The thing that I liked so much about it was that it has something for everybody. The baseball side of it appeals to guys and the love story between Freddy Prinze Jr. and Jessica Biel appeals to girls. It's just a great overall movie. Go see it!
3,"The entire movie is about sex, but it had a cute side story",So if you want to watch a bunch of stupid but likable guys have sex and talk about it through out this entire movie this is the movie for you:} The cute romance between the main actors is alright. It was just an ok movie.
3,"OK so it wasn't the cream of the crop, but still...","The movie was pretty tacky. We had more fun making up new names for the movie after my mom called it ""Baseball Dreams"" on accident then watching the movie itself, but hey, It's Freddie Prinze Jr. The sexual referances were very stupid, and the love theme was too classic (guy who mows the lawn and the rich girl), but it's worth watching just to see Freddie Prinze Jr. running through the sprinklers of a golf course in a thong."
2,not a home run,"This movie is the poor man's Bull Durham. It stars Freddie Prinze Jr as Ryan Dunne, who wants to become a professional baseball player. Then he meets Jessica Biel, a rich girl whose father is against her seeing Dunne. Matthew Lillard, Marc Blucas, Brittany Murphy and Brian Dennehy round out the cast.Prinze NEEDS to take his career in a different direction. All his roles are the same guy-funny,cute, always gets the girl. It's maddening to me because he was in a movie called Money Kings playing a villian. He wasn't bad either. He needs to take more risks and playing a variety of roles."
5,A Masterpiece of Pop,"The first CD has Paul & Barry singing together some typical songs from the British Invasion of the 60's. Very nostalgic sound ... but then comes the best ever. It's hard to believe that Barry could sing such superb arrangements written by Paul so long ago. A truly advanced pop sound way ahead of its time. The second CD contains the best pop song ever written and sung ... Eloise. This is better than any other pop song I have ever heard from the time, even more than Procal Harum's ""Whiter Shade of Pale"" or Queen's ""Bohemian Rhapsody"". A truly great experience!"
1,Ordering Fleur D'eau online ---Big mistake!,This was a total waste of money! Smells NOTHING like the fleur d'eau I know and love. In fact it smells like absolutely nothIng! I was so excited to find this online as it is no longer available in stores... But boy have learned my lesson! Jamais plus! Am only giving it a 1 star rating coz you have to select something to submit a review. It really deserves naught!!!!This was the first time I was ever disappointed with an amazon purchase! Dont do it!
3,"More Michelle, please!",Only two Michelle tracks? Her voice was the heart of the movie. Pretty darn ridiculous. I'm getting it purely to have her voice around whenever I want it because it truly is remarkable.
2,This is a real disappointment,"When I bought this CD, I thought I was buying the soundtrack I heard during the movie...which had a lot of songs that Michelle Pfeiffer sang! When I received it, I was disappointed that there were only 2 songs that Michelle sang. I feel cheated, because I never knew Michelle had that great a voice! If I wanted the bands that are on this CD, I would have ordered the big bands! I would like to get my money back on this CD! Thank God I also ordered the DVD!"
2,NOT WHAT I EXPECTED,"There are only two vocals by michelle pfeiffer! Where are the others? If it is advertised as the original motion picture sound track ,then include the complete recording.Otherwise state that it is not complete. I found that out after receiving the CD and reading the inside cover.Of course,the music on it is great,but had i known about this, i would ,definitely,not have ordered it."
3,Just a Taste,"This is really just an introduction to the Pimsleur system. It includes Lesson One from their regular audio course, and a series of travel-related dialogues for listening and repeating, with a printed booklet for following the ""story"".It could be helpful for practice in listening to spoken Italian, but it doesn't really offer a lot. I would recommend just going straight to the full Pimsleur course instead."
1,Propoganda,"The appendixes are the main useful parts of this book. According to this book any and all ailments that we have, (which we all in sometime have) according to this author we all are greatly deficient in any and every nutrient possible. To some extent he is true, but I think he is overdoing it here to get us on his side. The useful information here I think can be gleaned from some other book without being banged over the head by the authors agenda. If you live in central Florida, you can watch Cass Ingram on channel 14 on the show ""Know the Cause"" which comes on twice Mon-Fri at 12 and 12:30pm. But I do not at all recommend buying into the shows falseities. You can get more vitamins not by a supplement, but by juicing fruits and veggies daily and getting some sun and exercise."
1,Melted Tubing,I used this product exactly as directed and it melted my tubing. What a nightmare. I immediately ordered replacement tubing to be shipped via overnight mail. Not happy.
4,Quick and convenient,"For parents of newborns, time is a valuable commodity. This allows for quick and easy cleaning, and is something that can be traveled with without taking up the space of your home based sanitizer."
2,VERY SMALL,"I had been using the Dr. Brown microwave sterilizer but it accientally was broken so I was in the market for something new. The only downside to the Dr. Brown sterilizer is that it is bulky and finding a place for it. So I thought I would try bags and bought these Modela microwave sterilizer bags. They worked fine but the issue was with the size of the bag. They are tiny!! Could only get two bottles inside, so having to do a couple days worth of bottles took all day to do becuase I was doing them 2 at a time. The doc brown can hold 7 bottles plus all their nipples and takes the same amount of time. I'll definitely go back to bulky to save valuable time as a parent to an infant."
4,Great!,These definitely do their job! I use them more than the 20 times indicated and I don't think that's a problem. Just be careful of the steam when you open it and be sure to use tongs to take out the items - don't reach in!
3,"Convenient, need to be able to use more than 20 times though.","These are nice and easy to use, I just wish you could use them more than the recommended 20 times."
3,Very convenient but probably not necessary,"I bought these when I thought I needed to sterilize pump parts all the time, which terms out to be an overkill. All the lactation specialists I've spoken to say you really don't have to sterilize them after the first time but I still try to at least once a week or so. These bags make it super easy. Just be careful not to burn yourself with the steam or water that may come out of the vent on the side of the bag."
5,oater,the greatest western star of all time john wayne jumps off the screen and becomes real for an hour and forty five minutes. You'll love every minute of it.
2,Even Rock & The Duke Can't Save This,"Even the combined star-power of Rock Hudson and John Wayne can't save this tired rehash of far better similar westerns. The Yankee-in-Mexico plot has served as the basis for several classic westerns -- VERA CRUZ, THE PROFESSIONALS, THE WILD BUNCH -- but this comes up woefully short. The politics and conflicts are muddled to the point that it is hard to know just which side you're supposed to be rooting for. The above cited classics made it crystal-clear which side was in the right, even if it seemed the Yankee heros weren't sure themselves. Steer wide of this, even if you're part of the Duke cult."
5,Loved it!,I give this books 5 stars not because I love Johanna Lindsey and hate to see her books get less than they deserve or because I like to be in the minority (which I generally am) but because I thought this book was great. I agree it was extreme but sometimes the traditional romance can get boring and you need something to spice it up.
1,What a disappointment!,"I am usually a fan of Ms. Lindsey. Angel is one of my favorite romances. But this was... nearly indescribably disappointing. The heroine is raped repeatedly, and unrepentantly, by the supposed hero, yet she falls in love with him for no apparent reason. The villain is a two-dimensional stereotype, the side stories are predictable and bland, the main storyline is underdeveloped and does not build suspense. My time would have been better spent re-reading one of her other novels."
1,seriously?,its not so much the raping and hating of each other that goes on throughout the book right up to the end but what bothered me more is that even if we were expected to think thats a pirate in the 1600s where was there once a description by either one of them going crazy in each others arms that would slightly make this bearable when the got together it was the same spark as brushing ones teeth sad this one even if youre looking for an escape sth different you dont get that even read karen robards island flame exact same story but so sensually written!!!!!!!!!!
3,Not a typical lindsey,"To be quite honest, the book had potential. The only thing that would have made this book a 4 or 5 star would have been if the hero didnt keep on raping the heroine. I didnt quite understand its purpose. I mean, people find rape repulsive, not sexy. This is definitly not a typical Lindsey book. Even though this book was much of a failure, I still continue to read her other books. We also have to keep in mind that this was one of her earlier books."
2,Disgusted,I like most of Johanna Lindseys books and in fact own all of them but I do not find rape exciting and can not figure how the heroine could fall in love with her tormentor. Oh Well! To each his own.
2,"Almost, but not quite, an F","A Pirate's Love is the worst book I've read by author Lindsey. The book is little more than a series of kidnappings and/or rescues, rapes and recriminations, repeated several times throughout the book. There are a couple of good scenes very near the end, which is why it rated higher than one star.I'd recommend several Lindsey books over and above this one, including Man of My Dreams, Once a Princess, and, my favorite Lindsey, Prisoner of My Desire.TTFN, Laurie Likes Books"
3,Very weak plotline - but it's not *THAT* bad.,"PL's rape scenes didn't bother me as much as disjointedstoryline, and there did seem to be a lack of ""connection""between the main characters. This *is* one of Lindsey's earlier ones, so don't judge her entire work by this book. She's done much better and she's worth reading - her later stories aren't as ""violent"" or masochistic. The last few scenes are definitely overkill, I will agree on that point. It's a book that I'd pick up if I were bored, but luckily I'm not frequently bored :-) END"
1,Skip it!!!,"I'm a Johanna Lindsey fan, but after reading this novel, I found that I want my money and time back. The plot is stale, and the very idea that the main character was raped for the first half of the book THEN falls in love with her rapist is deplorable. I wish i had read the reviews before the book and saved myself both money and time."
1,A book about falling in love with the man who rapes you,"I'm a pretty big Lindsey fan, but this was the worst Lindsey book I've ever read! The fact that the ""pirate,"" Tristan, forced himself on Bettina day after day was NOT at all romantic. I found it upsetting. If Tristan wanted Bettina's love, he just had to love her without forcing her. This book is not worth reading. Thankfully this is one of Lindsey's first books. I'm guessing that she didn't have the romance ""formula"" down yet. Her other books are much better and don't involve the main character constantly raping the women he supposedly loves."
5,"review on the book ""actin' out""",My product was shipped in a timely manner and it was in as good of condition as the seller stated.
4,"Great fun at first, but doesn't have much depth","My 2 year old is a huge Pooh fan, and of course took to the good graphics and sound in this game right away. Some of the activities were rather non-sensical, but many were quite entertaining. Some of the counting and language excercises were very creative. The problem is that after we completed all of the activities and visited the bithday party (which took about 4 sessions), there was nothing else in the game to hold his interest."
4,Pooh fan,I bought this game for my just turned 2 year old because she is a big Pooh fan. Some of the activities are a little hard for her but there are enough levels to keep her occupied. It seems like a great value because she will be able to use it for a few years and the price is so low.
4,Great soul pop from Glasgow!,"After recording 'Remote', definitely one of the finest albums of the 80's, using loads of top notch American session musicians, this Scottish duo (brothers Pat & Greg Kane) returned to basics on this, their third studio effort. The album is mellow and laid-back, and includes great songs, such as 'My Salt Heart', 'Vera Drives', and 'Late In The Day', 'She Makes A Sound', as well as other more jazzy tunes. If you liked their first three albums, this is a must."
3,"good, but needs more informtion about pigeons!!!","could use more information about the different types of pigeons and there pictures. We have just started with ten pigeons and we are starting to training them. We are new at this and looking for any type of information about pigeons we can find, this book help us some but still need more information about pigeons"
4,Fundamentals for the Homilist,"About homilies as about life in general, it is tempting to feel the need in the 21st century to describe things in terms of success or failure.The thoughtful homilist must take courage that the most of those at Gettysburg considered the President's address too brief to be adequate for such an occasion.It is only with the benefit of 21 centuries of hindsight that many would judge that the words of Jesus himself were successful. Paradoxically Jesus' words appear to have been less inspiring to those who actually heard them than they have been to countless millions since! When does success begin?Homilies Alive clearly and interestingly sets forth basic scaffolding from which the weekly homily may be constructed. No priests or deacons could fail to improve their homiletic skills by following the advice in this more-than-commonsense book."
3,It had so much potential,"Karen Robards is one of my favorite historical romance writers. Desire In The Sun, Island Flame, Seafire and Dark Torment are a few of my favorite books. This book started off great but got boring near the middle. Normally her books are well written, but the writing was bad in this one. The dialogue was silly, IMO."
5,T.V. at it's best,I loved this show.Sad to see it go.At least I have the box set to watch whenever I want to relive it.
5,what about Brian?,"Good show! I was very sad to learn that they won't be making any more of the series. It seems these days they get a good show on television and then for some reason it gets cancled. I'd like to know who decides what stays and what goes, doesn't my opinion as a veiwer count for anything? Anyway, I do enjoy the show and can only hope they revive it sometime in the near future."
3,Horn good - mounting bracket useless,The horn itself is good but the mounting bracket is flimsy and does not work.
2,Disappointing,"I loved the House of Spirits, and count it among my top favorites, but Eva Luna was disappointing. The book begins fairly well, then teeters off into a dreamy poorly written romance novel where Allende lives vicariously through the heroine. Allende's character development and plot was unoriginal and unrealistic, and towards the end her writing style left a lot to be desired."
5,Handy remedy for jars,These have great friction to grip jar lids so that it takes a lot less strength to grip the lid while you turn. My Mom has rheumatism in her hands and likes these a lot.
4,Inventory 101,It was great when I was starting out; it was a guide to material handling and helped me go to that next level; Good book for a person just getting into Inventory.
2,Mystery lover,"Online reviewer Amorae pretty much says it all, but I would add that the gratuitous sex scenes interrupt what plot Berry has going. The descriptions are predictable and banal and their inclusion seems counterproductive for the author if he wishes to reach a wide audience of male and famale mystery novel readers. The topic of The Amber Room is certainly intriguing, but it deserves a better mystery woven around its disappearance."
3,OK read,The Amber Room was an OK read. I enjoyed the Third Secret better. I am really looking forward to reading the Templar Legacy. Mr. Berry improves his stories with each new book.
1,Disappointing Novel,"Berry's book is lengthy and tedious, with far too much historical enlightenment and not nearly enough character plot. The few central members of his cast become stale about a third of the way into the book, leaving the reader to question whether the rest of The Amber Room deserves the time and effort necessary to finish reading the novel. With two other books by the same title available for mass consumption, one might also question if redundancy is beginning to take hold."
3,"Just ok, not his best","Although my husband enjoyed this book, I found it just ""ok"" and a little tedious to get through. I've read all the books in the series now, and this one still had interesting info, enough for me to Google the Amber Room. Wish I'd had more background on the Amber Room when I visited it in 1997 ! It would have been even more amazing to have known the facts Steve includes."
5,Between history and fiction...,"Being a fan of Lindsey Davis' series of historic mysteries of Marcus Didius Falco, and also having recently read ""Vespasian"" by Barbara Levick, I found this novel to be an acurate and entertaining portrayal of the long time relationship of Vespasian and Caenis. It is neither the rollicking, irreverant narrative of Falco, or the dry statement of historical footnotes in a textbook; ""Course of Honor"" combines the best of both in a tale that gives a wonderful perspective on the life of one of Rome's better emperors through the eyes of the woman who truly stood by his side."
5,Great Book,"After chewing through all of MuCullough's Roman books, and waiting for a new one, I chanced across this one and decided to give Lindsey Davis a try. I was not dissapointed. A different perspective and a story I was not familiar with, I devoured it. Just a tiny bit romantic for my taste, but certinaly worth the read. If you have ever felt anything like Caenis and Vespasian felt for each other, this story will hit close to home. I now find myself compelled to investigate the Marcus Didius Falco books!"
2,"Far Below ""I, Claudius""","I like Lindsey Davis's Falco series, but I must agree whole-heartedly with ""A Reader's"" comments. This book drags, particularly in the middle section (when Vespasian is absent). In addition, like the Falco series and Steven Saylor, the protagonists have too much of politically-correct agenda (feminism, democracy, and, in Saylor's case, anti-slavery) to be really belivable First Century Romans. Robert Graves does it better."
1,Full of Errors!,"I received the Columbia Review book as part of an MCAT course I'm taking. The book is out of print, but just in case anyone is thinking about special-ordering it, DON'T!The book provides a decent overview of MCAT science, but the subject area practice tests that follow each section are full of errors. Some of the questions don't have a single ""best"" answer, while others don't seem to have any correct answers at all. I'm not talking about typographical errors; I'm talking about poorly written questions that do not reflect the level of difficulty of the real MCAT.Preparing for the MCAT is hard enough. You don't need review materials that make it even harder. Use the Kaplan Comprehensive Review, and if you want more practice on a particular subject, try the MCAT Biology/Chemistry/Physics series from Nova Press."
1,Practice Test Confusion!,"The information about the subjects may be adequate, but it does not explain it very thoroughly and the MCAT is about having a full understanding and being able to link concepts together. In addition, the tests have many mistakes! After having done a few passages, I started carefully picking through them after I had finished and found a few answers which directly contradicted the passages - these practice tests served only to confuse me. It feels as though no one proofed this book. Since then I've bought a book from Kaplan and Princeton and although they are a bit more expensive they have been used by many pre-meds with reliable results - and they don't have mistakes."
1,"Dry, dry beyond dry","I was one of the reporters for the Columbia Missourian who first profiled the arrest of one of the murderers discussed in this book, and I covered a lot of what prosecutor Joe Moseley did around that time, so I was very interested in this book.But I was incredibly disappointed when it arrived. This is the most dry, overly clinical, forgettable retelling of these stories -- geez, of any murder story -- that I can imagine. There is no suspense, no insight, no artifice, no writer's voice. Zero. All you get are four straightforward, third-person chronological narratives. I can't underline enough how dry this work is."
1,Filled with inconsistencies,"I bought this book because I am a forensic pathologist and wished to learn what another professional chose to write and how he wrote it. I could not have been more disappointed! While an average reader such as the one who wrote the review I read might not notice the inconsistencies, they ruined the book for me. I would have been quite willing to accept one or two, but when the number became much, much higher, I found myself wishing that Dr. Dix had chosen not to write a book at all. I have no knowledge of him, even though we are a relatively small group, perhaps 4-500, and over time we do get to know one another. He may be one of the best forensic pathologists in the country, but that did not come across in the book, in my opinion. I have chosen to use the word ""inconsistencies"" as it is kinder than ""mistakes"" but, actually, and sadly, both are present. I would never recommend this book to anyone who wanted to learn details of our profession."
2,It didn't completely suck.,"Well, Joan Severance is pretty hot, but Billy Zane couldn't act his way out of wet paper bag, and the script is ...slightly less than A List. But it does produce wood, which is probably part of the point, nyet? The other woman is also hot and somehow believable in her own shallowly defined role. It could been improved 2000 percent by the application of a writer and a Johnny Depp. give it fifty milligrams of Viagara."
3,Lake Consequence,"Lake Consequence is a classic Zalman King production-beautiful bodies, offbeat scenery, jazzy score, and little if any ""plot"" to speak of. If you enjoy this kind of film-and I do-then Lake Consequence is for you."
5,Top Notch Every Step of the Way!,Not only did I get my CD in such a few days but the music was like I had just bought it at the music store. THe condition was excellent and it gets played daily for I adore David Benoit and his music to relax by or set a mood.
3,This book is not accessible for the casual reader,"I bought this book in an attempt to expand my understanding of marine ecology from the perspective of a recreational scuba diver and a scientific reader.The book seems to have a lot of good content, but I had to put it down because I didn't have the strong foundation in marine biology for it to make much sense.Probably suitable for advanced readers!"
3,Disappointing,"I guess you really have to be a Red Steagall fan to fully appreciate this CD. I got it to glean cowboy songs for our performances, but didn't find anything I thought would work for us."
1,Good sound is a must.........this does not have it.,I listened to about two or three songs before I had to shut this cd off. This sounds like it was recorded live or Mr. Sledge did remakes of his own music. Either that or the quality of this disc is really bad. I was diappointed. I will leave it at that. There are plenty of other greatest hits albums that are out at stores and online here. Purchase one of the other ones they have. Do not listen to the other reviews they have listed here. I am just trying to help you out. Take my advise.Peter Rabbit
5,What today's music needs...,"...is a few more like this! Alison Sudol's songs are powerfully easy to listen to. I rate her with the likes of Rachael Yamagata, Abra Moore and Lauren Christy."
2,Don't bother,"This CD sounds like an album full of wanna be chart topping singles. There is 1 awesome song and 2 or 3 OK songs. The rest pretty much sucks. Almost all of the songs sound the same for the first 5 or 6 times i listened to the CD. The lyrics are a bit pretentious and it sounds like she wicshes she was famous not a good musician just my opinion. Go buy an Ivy, Sarah Blasko, Natalie Merchant, or Laura Veirs CD. You will be much happier with your purchase."
2,mediocre,"This is not an album that I would play frequently. I don't think the vocals are all that strong, and was surprised by all of the praise for her voice in the other reviews. The songwriting is OK, nothing special, and the keyboarding is just back up. I agree with the reviewers who felt that it got boring as it went along. I did enjoy parts of the first few tracks, which are simple but pleasant enough. This album seems best suited for a very young crowd."
1,A Fine ??? Frenzy,"Big let down all the way around. She changed her album cover, and it looks like death now. Almost Lover is the only decent song. She needs to throw the rest of it out to sea! Beautiful girl, horrible music!"
4,Great Major-Label Debut,"A Fine Frenzy's first studio album, ONE CELL IN THE SEA, marks a promising start for the band and in particular, singer/songwriting Alison Sudol. Unfortunately, the production on the album lends itself to generic top-40 pop music. Even so, there are many times where the songwriting overcomes the bland production to create memorable, (and remarkable) pop songs. For example, ""Almost Lover"" drops most of the music in favor of Sudol with a lone piano accompaniment, and the results are outstanding. On ONE CELL IN THE SEA, we find Sudol still working on finding her creative voice. The lyrics and music are all personal, but it is sometimes lost in the noise.In terms of A Fine Frenzy, I prefer the second album,Bomb In A Birdcage. Either album is a good place to start listening to the band. Fans of Ingrid Michaelson, Sara Bareilles, or Feist will love a lot of these songs. Recommended tracks to sample/download: ""Almost Lover,"" ""You Picked Me,"" and ""Come On, Come Out."""
5,Great CD,Fantastic CD with great music from A Fine Frenzy. Slow and upbeat music with a great singer. Would make a great gift for anyone.
3,Nice voice but too monotonous,"This artist can definately sing and is a very strong candidate for the production of an album, but the music that all of her songs are set to sounds the same for much of the album. There are a couple of songs that set themselves apart, but I can't say that for even half of the songs. I truly did want to love this album, but it just isn't meant to be even after listening to it several times through. Good voice, decent lyrics, but the synthetic feel and monotony of the music brings it down."
5,Amazing Debut Album,"I just heard this album last night and am already in love with it. I've been listening to it non-stop and it has only become more brilliant. The music is gorgeous and has utterly transfixed me. I can't recommend it enough!If you love/like Tori Amos, Fiona Apple, Sarah McLachlan, Imogen Heap/Frou Frou then you will love A Fine Frenzy."
5,Lovely and haunting,"This is a CD that I play whenever I'm in a wistful mood. Sudol's voice is alternately fragile and powerful--so much richer than the vocalizations of many more well-known artists.The most poignant track is ""Almost Lover.""Don't we all have one of those?A Fine Frenzy captures the emotional turmoil of ""what might have been"" married to the acceptance of ""what never will be."""
4,one cell in the sea,"Awsome production along with excellent musicianship. Her vocals are top notch but as usual the lyrics are about a woman scorned. I would never treat her bad althogh, i don't know her. Looking forward to the next release."
4,Good Movie,Its funny & you just don't know how exactly it will end but all & all its an older movie.A cat named Jake has to land on earth when his space ship breaks down.The space ship is found and taken away by the government who start to worry about strange beings finding their way to the white house & causing the downfall of the USA.Meanwhile Jake finds a brillant but not well known scientist to help Jake make repairs to his ship.What happens next?You really wanna know?If so buy the movie!
5,Good movie for all ages,"I remember watching this movie when I was younger and enjoying it. When I came across it here, I figured I should get the dvd version. I now play it at work for our clients to watch. Seems fitting for a vet clinic."
5,ONLY ONE KITCHEN PAN NEEDED!!,I purchased this pan about a year ago and I have to say it has literally replaced all of my other kitchen pans. I now steam every vegetable at once - adding them to adjust for their cooking time. I have given 8 of these for wedding gifts and the people seem to love it as much as I do. Wonderful Investment.
1,Not for glass top ranges,I bought this expecting a high quality product but the bottom is not flat and it does not work well on my glass top range. I would not buy this again. Only way I can use it is to go outside and cook on my gas grill's side burner. Bummer.
2,Not for use in wind,"After reading reviews I must honestly say I was disapointed of the Seattle sombrero. Yes, holds rain and keep You dry for a very long time, good fit and very light, but not usable in wind at all, as brim will blow up and down as it is not stiff enough. In western Norway that is usually the case."
5,The new standard...............but.,"I need a good rain hat. I often work outdoors, and I have to have good raingear.I have a Gore-tex hat that's a baseball cap style. Water runs down my neck.My co-workers all have the OR hat.I can see where high winds will be a problem because of the brim size, but this was better than the ""Gorton's of Gloucester"" style.Quality is top notch, just one word of warning.I'm a big guy so I ordered the XL..............it's big, really big.If I had to do it over, I'd get the L.Fortunately, I knew it had a Velcro adjuster sewn into the elastic band in the sweatband. So, I took about 1"" out of the band. Perfect. If the band stretches, I'm SOL.Not enough of a problem to return it, just be advised.The sizing chart looks to be correct, if in doubt, go to the smaller size.I will next time."
5,Sombreo Rain Hat,"I Love the Hat, because it is fasionable, and has the tie, so it can stay on your head. Those are the 2 great reasons, but I needed a hat for windy and more importantly rainy or wet snow weather. I have cronic Bronchitis, so I need to dress appropriately. Also love the color and it goes well with all my coats...I needed a hat for my trip to Florida on Nov 6th, and I was still not feeling that good, I was thrilled that the hat arrived in plenty of time, and I was able to fold it up in my tote bag, and it unfolded very nicely when I had to put it on.. Very Satisfied."
2,Title,I haven't tried it yet. Title & 15 more words required. Title & 15 more words required. Title & 15 more words required.
2,Not what I expected.,This looks like a solid resin chair from the pictures. They are hollow resin pieces with reinforcing cross pieces. Not as stable and very ugly from the back.
2,Would not purchase again,Ordered chair online for convenience but it is rickety and uncomfortable. The back of the chair is at an awkward angle that hurts my spine. The seat is hard so I had to purchase cushions. Not worth the money.
1,RAMSHACKLE,"i'm a huge pj harvey fan, but this dvd was really disappointing. i don't think it compares w/ reeling, which seemed much more revealing and interesting.the dvd is contrived much like her last album. for some reason she's trying too hard to be edgy and it's not working. she comes off being pretentious and self-absorbed.the ""backstage footage"" is laughable, most of the time she's talking about how one thing or another has ramshackle-ness, while looking at herself in a mirror w/ a handheld recorder.i saw her twice on this tour and was certainly not blown away--so the concert footage, it'w/ all of it's oh-so-cool editing (and josh k. flailing around like a fish out of water), didn't impress me.if you can see reeling, i'd recommend it over this.and rob ellis is still awesome."
3,Another one of those concert DVD's...,"...where the director can't keep his mitts off the ""change camera angle"" button or can't help mixing superfluous offstage shenanigans with what we really bought the disc for in the first place...to watch a concert.And this is one of those where they switch from one particular concert to another in each song. You know, you don't get a continuous show from start to finish. That's whack, if ya ask me.See The Black Crowes ""FREAK AND ROLL INTO THE FOG"" if you wanna see how a concert should be filmed. Sure, they mix various nights in with one song, but it's practically seamless and doesn't interrupt your concentration.The music in ON TOUR:PLEASE LEAVE QUIETLY is really good, but there oughtta be a law...station a few cameras at strategic points in the concert hall and just lazily go from one to another and let us enjoy the show as if we were there."
3,Hang the editor!,"I have to agree with reviewer S. Kurtz. The music on this DVD is a solid 5 stars easy, smokin band, great performance, great sound.The problem is all the freaking cuts. At one point I noticed the picture changed with EVERY sylabel of a sentence. I could not concentrate and just enjoy the performance. Note overly clever film editors, people who purchase music DVD of music they generally already own do not need the phoney added excitment of being blasted of images of the artist.We buy this stuff becasue of the MUSIC, so STOP STOP STOP it, it is totally not needed. PJ Harvey fans will buy this anyway, get over yourselves. If you want to see how a concert DVD should be done check out ""X: Live in Los Angeles"". Yes there are cuts during songs but certainly not in the 100's per song."
5,"Beautiful puzzle, fun, and sturdy",Delivery was shipped quickly. Very enjoyable to put together during our trip to the beach. The kids wanted to do it over and over again.
4,"Its cheap, it worked for us.","I bought this for one of my kids' frames which was new. Its no work of art but it fit tightly, it works. It cost me the same as my lunch did. I can't complain. I saw the other reviewer with the used frame has an issue. Maybe this item doesn't fit as well on frames that have had a headset installed already? Not sure.."
1,Save your money and get a real headset,"Ordered this for an older Giant TCR I am building,needless to say my attempt to save a couple bucks is gonna result in me ordering another headset,this thing is poorly machined and too small to fit my Giant frame or any of the other three road frames I had laying around. I was ready to order a Ritchey headset when I saw this one and now I wish had spent the extra seven dollars."
4,C.S. Lewis writing on his grief at losing wife to cancer,"This book reveals C. S. Lewis's handling the great grief endured following his beloved wife's death to cancer. It is insightful, well written, thought provoking, but in no real way addresses handling the grief one suffers from the sudden death of a beloved child, which is what I was looking for. A good read, but not what I was really expecting."
3,"Disc 1 was Disc 2, Disc 2 was Disc 1","I was excited to receive my own, long awaited copy of A Grief Observed. I had previously borrowed a friends copy (also purchased from Amazon) only to find that Disc 2 was blank. When my copy arrived I went straight to Disc 2 only to find it was acutally the beginning of the book. And when I put in Disc 1 I finally heard the last chapters. Other than the confusion I think the book is fantastic!! In fact, it's the best literrary work I've found in dealing with death, the grieving process loved ones go through before death, and what reactions to expect of others after the fact. I now loan my copy to everyone who is going through a death in their family - I just have to explain that Disc 1 is Disc 2, and Disc 2 is actually Disc 1."
1,No Support,"This booklet by C. S. Lewis is too cerebral; too spiritual; too philosophical for me. It did not provide the support I needed. The booklet ""The Tander Scar"" (also available from Amazon) by Richard Mabry is much more down to earth with practical guidance on what the grieving person will experience and how to cope with it. It was much more meaningful to me in my time of need."
3,A Grief Observed,"We all must face Death of a loved one or also for ourselves. Its one point of view, but everyone handles it differently. It was ok."
3,"Not, ""When Bad Things Happen to Good People""",Lost a child. C. S. asks me to work very hard. I can't do it. Kushner gets to the heart of grief.
4,Great book for kindergartners,"I bought this book for a Pre-K through K lesson plan. I used the book to encourage students with choral reading. This book reminds me a little of the Old McDonald song where the singer makes the animal noises. This book is easy for students to follow along with because the words a few and repetitive. The kids really enjoy being able to ""read"" along with you."
5,Wireless Fence,"I have four Goldens' this system by Petsafe is the best you can get (smile). I use three base units, which gives me a large area for the dogs. I have been using Petsafe for seven years (vary happy)."
4,Second lost collar,We hava a 120# mastiff/shepherd mix who has a very strong prey drive. The collar stops him in his tracks. Little training needed before he got the idea of where his bounderies are. The only problem is with the collar. He came in this morning without his collar - again. We searched all over the full boundry but were unable to find it. Leads me to beleive that perhaps battery died without warning and he was somehow able to rub his collar off. He would have had to un-fasten it as his head is too big for it to slip over. In process of ordering 3rd collar and can not help but agree that petsafe has us over a barrel. Wish it were not so expensive as this will probably mean top ramin soup for the rest of the month. Definately going to put receiver on a buckle type collar this time. Other than collar failure and price we love this product.
3,over a barrel,"The Petsafe wireless fence system is ideal for my family. However, Petsafe knows that they have us over a barrel. The system is a simple transmitter/receiver setup but is has been made unnecessarily expensive. The system is not cheap, however, the fact that any additional collars are at a minimum of $120 and the batteries, that you will need to change every 6 weeks or so, are expensive - and exclusive, of course.This is a wonderful alternative to having to fence in your yard to contain your pet, but you need to realize that it is an ongoing, not insignificant expense. I will be glad when Petsafe has some competition out there and are forced to bring their product more reasonably priced."
2,Warning for long hair dogs,"Caution about the prongs/probes on the wireless replacement collar!! I am pleased with the wireless system, but lost the original collar. I bought a replacement collar and there is no warning on the package that it is not for long haired dogs or that you must purchase a seperate accessory kit for long haired dogs. The manual says to call customer service for a long prong/probe to use with long haired pets. Customer service wanted to charge me for the kit. First, the replacement collar is expensive enough that it should come with both short and long prongs. Second, the packaging should state an additional prong purchase is necessary for long haired dogs or PetSafe should send you the long prongs free of charge. The short prongs on the replacement collar are not effective with long hair. Beware!The customer service rep was rude and basically told me to purchase the accessory kit or shave my dog's neck!!"
1,The bands are cheap and large dogs will chew them up,"I have three golden retrievers and after about 35 days they chewed the cheap red collars off of each other then chewed the receivers up. Unfortunately, the free warranty lasts only 30 days. I called PetSafe and as a one-time courtesy they are replacing the receivers and collars for $45 each. I was told they make a black collar that may be a bit stronger. We'll see. In any case, I rate the out-of-the-box product low and potentially a several-hundred dollar loss."
3,Eh..,"The receiver itself works good, but the collar was cheap and frayed within a week. I've already had to buy a replacement."
4,"Quick, valuable read.","The book reads quickly and easily; but still manages to remain quite informative.The book covers a number of periods in which rampant financial speculation was present. The end lessons: ""It's not different this time"" and ""History is bound to repeat itself"""
2,A little too short a history!,"This book was a little too short. The pages are small with large print, so you basically get 40 pages of information. While this book is probably good for someone who is just starting to learn about bubbles/depressions, it is not worth your time if you want detail and a lot of information. If you have read ""The great crash: 1929"", you can skip this. You won't get a lot more information than you could simply get searching wikipedia."
4,"Funny, informative, concise",A good quick book which will leave the reader with a healthy sense of skepticism about financial speculation.
1,NOT WORTH MORE THan A DOLLAR,"SORRY BUT THIS MOVIE SUCKs! I RENTED IT FROM THE REDBOX FOR 1 DOLLAR AND IF I WOULD HAVE PAID MORE, I WOULD HAVE BEEN UPSET! I USALLY LOVE GHETTO MOVIES BUT THIS ONE WAS JUST DUMB. THE STORY LINE WAS WEAK AND THE ACTORS WERE EVEN WEAKER! SAVE YOUR MONEY ON THIS MOVIE, WATCH IT ONLY IF YOU ARE BORED OR CAN SEE IT FOR FREE!"
5,Insightful look into loss of farmland.,"Producter/director Matthew Schulte and crew offer an informed and indepth look into the loss of farmland (""open spaces"") due to the seemingly inevitable incursion of civilization. The presentation...a mix of interviews and voice-over storytelling...is well-balanced and thoroughly fascinating. Though the examples sighted are located in the state of Michigan, the problems and solutions pertain to all parts of the country. Look for other topical videos in the blooming Preservision series."
1,Blistering Sun,There is only one song on the entire CD that I like. It is not well produced and I don't care for the artist's voice. Musicianship is avegage at best.It does not measure up to other contemporary artists working today.
3,SAVED BY 3 SONGS,"Temporary Thing is a brilliant tour de force full of Reed's customary bitterness and caustic wit, with an impressive arrangement and gripping melody. Vicious Circle explores a theme often visited by Lou - the individual on a path of self-destruction surrounded by ""so-called friends,"" and is quite memorable. So is the title track which I find very amusing - the lyrics are saved by the catchy tune and the enthusiastic playing. Yes, it's quite a rocker.Unfortunately the rest of the album remains very forgettable. It's not that the songs are bad, they just lack passion and good tunes. It would nevertheless be a pity if the 3 above-mentioned songs remained unexplored just because they're buried on a mediocre album."
5,antique book,"This book is a real treasure. The only other copy I have seen was at the Huntington Library in San Marino, CA."
2,A Little Misleading,"I have to say I feel misled. When I received the DVD, the all important clue words - that are hidden online - are, ""Intermediate Level For Boomers."" Please keep in mind that the best Pilates instructor I've ever had was over 50 and I've had a rebounder since before it was even called an ""urban rebounder."" To me, this is a good workout for someone 55+ starting out a fitness regime. But for those of us who are looking for a more comprehensive workout (one that coordinates arm-toning with footwork) it falls short. And, the preview to the actual workout is way too long...even fast-forward doesn't get through it fast enough. The production is like a cheesy home movie, not living up to the cost. But Blanche did cause me to break a sweat!"
3,average,"I own a 1973 Kawasaki G5-A and according to the description this would be the manual for me. However, I am not impressed with what I recieved. I understand that all the models listed are very similar, there are several parts of the bike that are not even mentioned (such as ignition,speedometer) the wiring diagram for my bike is not even listed in this manual. Which by the way is mostly why i bought it. Amazon was wonderful as usuall. no problems with them, i just wish clymer would have spent more time putting this book together. Lacks alot of needed diagrams for models it says it is suppost to have. (mostly bikes older than 1976)"
5,Lilting and soulful,"Mary Oliver is a poet of the human spirit. Her use of metaphor is so rich I felt as though I was experiencing the beauty and intensity of nature with the author. I never thought I wanted to write poetry until I read Oliver. Now I sit and watch the cat ""...where she leaps lightly and for no apparent reason across the lawn, then sits , perfectly still, in the grass. I watch her a little while, thinking: what more could I do with wild words?"" Indeed, what more could anyone do? Mary Oliver writes meditations on nature and her words reach the human core."
5,Poetry from a Superb Crafter of Words,"My favorite book of poetry, winner of the 1992 Nat'l book for Poetry and the Pulitzer Prize. Mary creates beautiful imagery with phrases like:""This morning the green fists of the peonies are getting ready to break my heart - as the sun rises, as the sun strokes them with his old, buttery fingers..."" Terrific inspiration for journaling!!!"
5,Poet of the Natural World,"My copy is dog-eared, and I've bought copies for friends in Ireland, Germany and Ecuador, as well as at home. Oliver's poems of the natural world help us see our oneness with All That Is. I hear her poems read in my Buddhist sangha, my Catholic parrish and also at AA meetings. I'd give her six stars for this book if I could!"
3,Decent Legal Overview of A-12 Debacle,"This book is a good managerial/legal overview but lacks technical depth and any analysis of the human cost incurred by the A-12 cancellation debacle. It exhaustively details program management missteps and lays out the legal argument which favors the contractor assertion that the program (excuse me, contract) was terminated for convenience. However, the reader is left with the misleading impression that most engineering problems (and there were many) were resolved by the time of cancellation. However, in January 1991, there were many challenges ahead that drawing release tracking charts did not reflect. In the final analysis, Dick Cheney did the right thing the wrong way and thousands of workers were fired virtually overnight by companies that had mortgaged their futures trying to get a piece of the stealth pie; Mr. Stevenson got it mostly right."
1,More BS from Jim Walls,"Gee, we have to have ""Faith Based"" organizations to change lives and neighborhoods across America. What a load of BS. From the day this country was formed there were people taking care of people whether faith was involved or not. Walls just loves to get preachy on the platform of righteousness. People who care about others are religious or not. They just have a basic need to get outside of EGO and place the welfare of others equal to their own. To place Religion doctrine (which is NOT necessarily ""Christian"") before the feeding of the hungry is as anti-Christian as it gets."
3,Nice stories about small boats,"This books owners tell about their experiences with 8 small boats. If you think you must buy a big boat, read this and you'll see it's not so. Just depends on your application and how squished you're willing to be on a longer passage. The different writing styles and perspectives of the various owners is a pleasure."
1,"Nice looking bottle, tastes like (*&@#$","this stuff is supposed to help you lose weight. If vomiting is what they hope you'll do to lose the weight, then the taste of this stuff might just do the trick. If you buy this, I would recommend mixing it with about 25 parts of orange juice to 1 part celsius and hold nose while drinking."
4,MORE!!!,"Ok, 1st off, there are 6 tracks. 2nd, why the heck are there ONLY 6 tracks?? 3rd, Only buy this if you're a HUGE fan like myself. and fourth and most importantly... get this @ Sony's site and it will only cost ya 6.99 instead of whatever price these used cd cons are selling them for!!"
2,Play station 3,"I saw the review and tried to connect my PS3 with port 5 but it did not work.All other DVD and HDTV works great but if you'd like to connect to your PS3, then this is not the right product."
1,This item doesn't work for 1080 HDMI,"Cheap should be the warning. Works for HDMI for DVD, not Blu-ray. Maybe not even 720p or i. Total suck. Also has super bright leds that blast your eyes if you have it anywhere in sight. Plus the ""smart"" feature is about as stupid as most drivers on the road today. Remember, let the buyer beware>>>>>Go Amazon!!!"
2,Doesn't completely work,"This switch would not work with my Samsung DVDVR357. It worked fine with the Dish Network DVR, but not the DVD Recorder. I tried all sorts of settings to try to get it to work, but it simply wouldn't work."
5,Great HDMI Switch,This unit is very compact and easy to use!!!! I will recommend this product to others.
5,Just what I need,I was looking for a fuel dot filler wit 'T'coupler which is just what I needed for my airplane
2,Better books out there.,"I've been reading many books like this one. I have a child with attention problems and one who is defiant. This book was hard to read and didn't really give me any good stategies that I haven't already learned in other books. Honestly, I had to skim though most of it because it was so boring. So, maybe I missed some good parts.My favorite book so far is How To Talk So Kids Will Listen and Listen So Kids Will Talk. I highly recommend this book! This book gave me strategies to use for all four of my children and has made a big difference in how my children obey me, talk to me and talk to each other. We are all much happier. It is so wonderful that I am making my husband read it. Also, it is fun to read!"
2,Didn't mention mental problems child may have!,"This book is okay if you don't have a child with severe problems. My child is ADHD and ODD but there is no mention of coping with mental illness in this book.I bought it thinking help would be inside the pages, but was dissapointed instead; When it was read."
3,"A little too large for me, maybe a good home charger, not really for travel.","This charger is OK. It works fine, not as quickly as advertised, but that doesn't bother me so much. The problem is I bought it to use with my digital camera, which takes 4 AA batteries. I wanted a fast but small charger so that I could travel with it, but this one does not fit in a camera case, it has to go into the suitcase. Also, it does not have a built-in plug, it has a fairly long cable, which is one more thing to carry. So, if you are looking for a home charger, this may be fine, but it is no travel charger."
4,Inspiration For Our Young People,"Beautifully done. Should inspire inner-city children across America to rise above their surroundings. If only more of us would encourage and support this type of story, rather than some of the mindless garbage we let our children watch, things might change for the better.The line about almost letting a ""little black girl"" beat you, spoken by the Chinese father, was reminiscent of reading Dr. Ben Carson's autobiography ""Gifted Hands."" It seems no one can believe it when African-American young people rise above the rest scholastically. One drawback though, not one boy of African-American background anywhere past the initial Crenshaw Middle School Eliminations. Or even another black girl for that matter. Only a faint glimpse of them seated in the background. I guess that was to make Akeelah standout even more so."
5,One of the year's best,"There are too few movies where you can take the whole family, kids and all, and have a good time. This is one of the best. Don't miss it."
5,Bee is A+ Entertainment,"I love any film that promotes education, but this film is truly terrific. The actors are all great, the script is intelligently written even with some cliches thrown in, and it does what most films like it are supposed to do; it inspires. My favorite element in this film is how Fishburne's character attempts to teach Akeelah the difference between fitting in with one's peers and creating self-imposed limits on one's potential.The other reviews on here say enough along with Amazon's synopsis and review of the film, so I can't add much more here. It is a film worth owning or at least renting."
4,a feel Good Movie,"this is the Kind of Movie that truly makes you feel Good. now on the real, I ain't the best Speller in the world, so watching this film i was in awe throughout this film with the Way Akeelah was knocking those words out the Box. this film also shows that no matter where you live, your background,etc... that Intellignce, Will&Drive are everywhere. you just have to give everybody a chance to reach there potential. i dug how this film at the end brought the two kids together as Winners. we need more films that uplift."
5,"God Bless LTJ, God Bless them every one","This album is one of the greatest by the greatest band on earth. You can tell (if your a first listener) that this is when LTJ was first budding due to a garagebandlike sound. Some of the songs rock so much, that they have used them in their later CDs. The punky/ska/butt-kicking music and lyrics are awesome, and it does me proud to call them a band. This title by LTJ is the way to go if want something worth listening to."
5,Pezcore: yet another awesome cd from Less Than Jake,"Pezcore is without a doubt, equal in quality and energy to Losing Streak and Hello Rockview. They open the cd with Liquor Store which always puts me in a good mood. Throughout the cd they talk about the freedom that they have and the freedom that they desire. Just like every other cd there is a song about a break-up, and ""Jen Doesn't Like Me Anymore"" would be it. But LTJ brings an upbeat way of dealing with it and moving on. And, last but not least, what would a cd be without a secret song? About a minute after ""One Last Cigarette"" ends, they have a cover of Laverne and Shirley's theme song. This cd is definitly worth the 13 or 14 dollars it costs, with 19 songs (not including the cover song. Each song brings something new out in the band, and gives you something new to like. Pezcore is on my cd player right now, and rarely leaves, except for the Deftones and Limp Bizkit. I know you'll enjoy the cd as much as I do. GO BUY IT!!"
1,This price is absurd,"Why would anyone want to purchase a book that is 10 years old and just over 100 pages for $95. No way this book is worth that much, especially considering that the author is not even the originator of the 46 defense."
4,Kids and adults will like this movie,"Delightful, engaging, suspenseful, hilarious, and touching. Loved ""Holes!"" For kids, adults, and especially for teens. Not for children under 8 or so."
4,DVD,Got this dvd because my class read the book. It didn't come as quick as the others I had ordered but it was Christmas at the time and came from further. It was in excellent condition. My students liked comparing it to the book.
4,"My Word (and one for the asses- oops! i mean, AUSSIES..)","This is a good family film, lots of laughs, clean humor; I also enjoyed the works of Louis Sachar as a child... thanks to Disney for sticking to the original story!As for the other reviews, in response to the AUSS-holes spewing all that crap about FALLUJAH and terrorism (I am a proud American)- may we suggest you get a life?!They asked for a review on ""Holes"" the movie, not the one in your head!Sorry you're so open-minded that your brain leaked out.IT'S JUST A MOVIE. Maybe you should join Michael Moore in the monastery and think about what's wrong with YOU. In fact, I'd be happier if you and he stayed there, because you are REQUIRED to SHUT UP."
5,nothin's better,"If you knew me,all you would hear is holes,holes,holes! Seen the movie 4 times,read book 3 times,and listen to the soundtrack non-stop. I ask everyone 'have you seen (or read)holes?' If they haven't,I highly recommend it. Both book and movie.no one should miss it!"
4,Aha HA it is possible!!!!!,It is now known to make a book movie tranaction that stuck to the books! Although I don't think that that kid should've played Stanley. Stanley was rather large in the book. But nothing is perfect. Aw well this was a prime example of book to movie transaction.
1,Why did we rent this?,"I rented this movie with my husband and daughter. Now my daughter LOVES movies and will sit forever watching a movie if it's good and entertaining. This didn't hold her attention for more than 10 minutes. After it was over we were left with a feeling of ""what the heck?"" It's really odd and way too hard for a kid to follow. It switches around between present day and old West constantly and never ties it all together until close to the end of the movie so you're left with a feeling of confusion. The scenes all looked the same, not much variation and it just seems so odd to me that this was marketed towards kids. There is some language that I would prefer not to have my child hear and the casting wasn't that great. Sorry Disney, but I'd have to give this one a thumbs down for a poorly done confusing mess."
3,This movie is a cool Disney show and stuff,"This movie is cool because there's a kid who gets in trouble, and he goes to a camp that's in the desert. There, he has to dig a hole every day as punishment. He finds something, but I can't tell you and stuff. The kid gets away and stuff, and they find stuff. Go see it."
1,"Amazing, Wonderful, etc! - Unless your accent is Southern.","Show this film to all classrooms in American and broaden everyone's horizons!! If you have a mainstream accent you are modern, progressive and kind. If you are a Texan or other Southerner you are degenerate, evil, backward and violent. This film couldn't be manufactured about any other group or class of people in America without outrage and the intervention of the Department of Justice, the Modern Language Association, the APA and a thousand so-called civil rights groups and media outlets. But effective the film is; few of the reviewers on these pages are able to discern this criticism; their consciences are completely blind. Could there be a double standard in this country? LOL This film is nothing more than a crudely made hate crime. However, both Dule Hill and Shia LaBeouf demonstrate their respective talents, which have to led to success and recognition. For the acting pros in this film, shame on you."
3,Not as good as the book,"This movie was really cute and had good characters however it was not as good as the book. There were a few missing parts that were in the book and not in the movie. I would recommend the movie if you are looking for a cute kids movie, especially for young boys but read the book first!"
5,French Pastry,"I love the smooth femine voice of Arielle, the decidedly French vibe, and the simple happy delights of this cd."
4,night time reading...,"highly recommended to fans of ""the Thing"" gave a lot of creedence to the movie and as character names were the same as movie (Copper , MacReady) it was rather enjoyable and easy to picture in one's ""minds eye"" what was happening , although there were very subtle differences which made it a little different , but not to the point of annoyance."
5,"Anointed, Anointed & Holy",I've had the opportunity to see and hear the Williams Sisters in Concert and truly this was a amazing experience. Jesus will pick you up if he has to reach way down.
4,one more opinion,"I find myself agreeing in many ways with every reviewer. This is an uneven release; I think it's not up to Archiv standards in the matter of balance for one thing. I have a large system and I had to back off the bass some and emphasize the treble some and still found the lack of sibilants interfered with the choral sound. The words are committed to memory by now but I still want to hear those words clearly. I rarely have to move tone controls from the flat position and this is odd to find in Archive. Otherwise this is a huge pice of work!. I especially enjoyed the""Agnus Dei"" opening; the chorus sounds like they truly are calling a lamb to come to them and I found the idea endearing.Paul Mac Creesh has a flair for these epic productions; I think of his reconstruction of the ""Coronation of the Doge"" in Venice with music from Gabrielli. Gigantic proportions well done. I play these things about once a year, they tend to overwhelm."
4,Must have in Afghanistan,"Purchased at Bagram Afghanistan PX in 2007 and this watch is a must-have for anyone treking into the mountains (of which I did, alot). Over the years the watch has taken a beating - the bezel is scratched up but, I still get a lot of comments about the watch. The altimeter (incl the memory function) worked very well. Battery replacement is easy (and has to occur about once a year). The watch is a typical ABC watch, that looks good and does the job."
4,great for the price,"time and altimeter features are great. I do not use the stop watch part etc. Basics are great, can tell how much vertical climbing I've don and in how much time. Barometer is a nice feature gives you a idea as to weather changes, and compass is ok gps would be better., but for $130.00 I feel I got my monies worth"
3,It's okay....,I mainly bought this watch for the altimitor and it doesn't work very well. It has different reading when I am in the same location different times. I still haven't used all the features year (still learning how) but so far it is just an okay watch.
4,Caught Up,"Nobody's Business by Rebecca Simmons is an excellent first novel. I felt like Rebecca did a good job of portraying exactly how someone can get caught up in a whirlwind of life's events and not be able to see the forest through the trees. It's so easy for someone to not be able to figure out how to get themselves out of a situation, even when the solution to the problem may be a simple one.On another note, I found it a little refreshing to be able to read an entire novel without having to filter through all the profanity that is so prominent in novels now. I couldn't put it down. I bought it on a Saturday afternoon and was done by Sunday morning. I can't wait for the next one! Keep writing, Rebecca."
5,Most get Ska-Punk cd,"This is an awesome ska/punk cd that is solid all the way through, while not as good as Operation Ivy's Energy this album is up there. Great horns, nice vocals, just great fast paced ska punk."
5,Review,"Hailing from Chicago, Illinois, they are perhaps the greatest ska-punk band that has ever been or ever will ever be. The vocal combo of Brenden Kelly's rasp and Dan Andriano's smooth back-ups, coupled with the blaring horns over mean guitar riffs has never been done by any other band the way Slapstick does it. Simply awsome!"
1,Extremely bad role models for girls,Am I the only one who thinks this looks like a packet of birth control pills? Not really something I'd want my nine-year-old toting around.
2,did I really buy this book?,"Reading this book is difficult, I don't know if I'll be able to get through it.12 point type gets a 12 point paragraph indent, 14 point type gets a 14 point paragraph indent, this book has paragraph indents of .5 inch, which suggests the type should be 36 pointsIt's as if the book is trying to hypnotize a person into being a good typesetter, my eyes zigzagged back and forth, and this voice started saying, ""you will be a good typesetter, you will be a good typesetter."" Something about the excessive white space at the beginning of the paragraphs was putting me to sleep. So any good information about typesetting will be hard to extract."
4,enjoyable book,"This book was assigned for my Global Studies II class. This book is a great way to catch a person's attenion on the issues of apartheid in South Africa. It shows how black South AFricans had no freedom and all of the horrers they had been through. Mark Mathabane gave great details. This book has really touched me. When I read what happened, I felt like I was there and a part of them. A lot of people say that it was very distasteful because of the sexual parts. I think that it just showed one of the ways the blacks were treated. I didn't give this book 5 stars because in one part it kind of dragged on. But otherwise it was very interesting and really made me feel and understand what happened in South Africa when apartheid was legal."
3,adjustable weights,I was disappointed in this product which I bought for its adjustability. the bean bag weights are very difficult to put back into the pouch. I also think that they will break apart after several times of removing and replacing the bean sections.The fit works well and they are comfortable to use.
4,great product,"These weights are perfect, especially for women. They are not too bulky like others. They are also great for individuals who have arthritis in their hands and fingers and cannot grip hand weights."
2,confusing description!!!,"I was expecting two 10# adjustable ankle weights. Instead I got two adjustable 5# weights. Description was not clear. Not worth sending back due to the weight and cost of shipping. If you are very weak, these might be adequate. But even older adults doing strength training soon are able to lift more than 5 pounds per leg. Difficult to put on. Would very much benefit from a velcro stap to hold weights on ankle, until strap is put on and tightened. I like the 7 1/2 pound adjustable weights by Millenium better."
3,Not comfortable at all,"The velcro on them is good and they stay securely on your wrists or ankles BUT they are very uncomfortable to wear, and even when fastened as tight as possible, they still slip off of my wrists.I read the other reviews before buying this product and saw that many people said they were too large but I figured it wouldn't apply to me since i have fairly large hands, for a woman. sadly, i too, am affected.Bottom line is that I would not have bought these if i had the chance to try them on first."
1,Do not buy!,These work great as paperweights but that's about it. I used them once and tried adjusting the weights. The little packet does not go in easily at all. Plus the black cover on it ripped almost immediately. I was not using a lot of force but it just came completely undone. Then the inner packet broke and that grainy stuff went everywhere. I tried using them still but they were very uncomfortable. Going to try another brand.
2,bulky and slips off,"The weights are not very good for using around the wrists. I have medium/large female hands and it falls off easily unless you strap it in this awkward way (I have to tuck a lot of material under itself so that the velcro can be adjusted tightly enough). Also, the insertable weights themselves are bulky and cut into my wrists. Other than this, though it seems pretty functional and as described is adjustable for heaviness."
2,A Decent Story Buried in a Flood of Stereotypes,"Somewhere underneath all those silly character stereotypes is a decent story screaming to get out. Unfortunately, I found myself chuckling at the absurdity of things more often than I was creeped-out by the horror of the story. None of the characters is very likable or even remotely sympathetic. With the exception of the ghost, you get the impression every other major character brings most of their misery upon themselves. It's hard to root for the heroine when you spend most of the read shaking your head and/or laughing at her. Again, there's a decent story buried amidst the political and social stereotypes. If you're willing to overlook a good deal of silliness, it's a decent enough story to kill a few hours."
4,Pleasantly surprised...,"I purchased this for the Korn videos but found a few gems within this DVD... primarily Rammstein and Limp Bizkit. However, be prepared for the shock of Rammstein! Excellent music, however. If you're a true Korn, heavy metal fan, it's worth the price. Could have done without the Ice Cube but only b/c I'm not a rap fan."
4,Great Late 90's Hard Rock,"The Family Values '98 DVD is basically the same video released on VHS last year. You get 3 live performances from KoRn, Limp Bizkit, Orgy, Rammstein & Ice Cube, AND in the DVD edition, a photo gallery from the tour. The visual quality was obviously enhanced for DVD, which is good, but remastering the sound for 5.1 surround would have been too much to ask (though standard Dolby Surround is present). Not the best hard rock/metal DVD available, but is a worthy concert video for fans of late 90's trend metal."
3,"OK, but not fantastic.","This video was okay because it had good filming of the crowd and the bands, but what really made me madwas that they only put 2 Rammstein songs on there, mis-spelling ""Buch Dich"" as ""Buck dich"", and spelling C.S.'s name ""Christoph Scheider"" and Till's name ""Till Lindermann""!!! Those 4 Ice Cube songs weren't any good either."
1,Phone case,The Silicone case fits loosley aroud the phone & the input cutouts don't aline well with the input jacks. I would never order one again.
2,Just not what I expected.,just my own fault for not reading about the product more clearly. Just was not what I was looking for.
5,Great books to help my son learn to read.,"This book set is great for my 15 month old to carry around. We read a book, put it back and he loves to carry it around, with the other set of Curious George board books we got him. He feels like a big boy when he brings his box of books to us."
4,This book is wonderful!,"I adore the Curious George books, this is a wonderful book. I think it teaches kids to be responsable for their actions. The books show that with every action there is a consequences."
5,wonderful collection,"I loved Curious George when I was a kid, I mean I loved this monkey. And revisiting him or 20 years later, I found that I still love George. And it is great to find all the books in this one, nice, hardcover collection. I read it to my nephew and neice, and they loved it, as I'm sure your kids will too (and more than a few of you adults)."
4,"Good little books - very simple, good for babies","Only a few words per page, so this can be read in a matter of 2 minutes. Nice quality, durable hard books."
4,A trip down memory lane,I really enjoyed reading these stories that I grew up with. I read it on my ipad and the pictures are stunning. I would either buy the paperback or read on an ipad. The pictures don't show up that great on the kindle and the colors of the pictures are great. I
4,"Gruesome, but still a great work","If a picture is worth a thousand words, then this is the book you should ""read"" about the Civil War. Certainly the goals of the book were well accomplished. I could have done without the numerous times the author explains in detail about the bloating of the bodies and how the bacteria cause it....it was brought up so many times I thought he must be a bit morbid. Nevertheless, it's not a book to entertain but to depict what was, and it does this very well."
4,Very dense reading,"This is a fantastic book that will tell you all you could ever want to know concerning the organization and operation of Napoleon's armies but be ready to drown in a sea of information. Whoa to those who don't already have a basic knowledge of the history of Napoleonic France, the major players in the Grande Armée, and the more important battles it fought - you will be initially lost."
4,Does the Job,"This accessory is desgined to be used with the telescoping pressure washer pole. It comes with the standard 1/4"" quick-disconnect couplers - a male on one end and a female on the other end. NOTE: it does NOT come with a nozzle! You need to buy that separately. The accessory itself is nothing more than a 1/4"" piece of pipe with male NPT threaded ends. I found that the quick-disconnect coupler tended to rotate freely on the end of the wand and that I really wanted a 90 degree elbow on the end that goes in the gutter. So, I've removed the quick-disconnect couplers and used regular galavanized pipe fitting to (1) connect it to the telescoping wand and (2) add the 90 degree elbow for easier gutter cleaning."
4,Ha Excel!,Not my favorite book to read but if you wanted to know about Excel! this is the book!!!! Kinda a bible for Excel. I love the Zip samples that you can download online.http://www.mrexcel.com/learn-excel.html
4,Using Mr Excel,There are a lot of great tips in this book. I purchased the book in order to provide my employees additional training in the use of Excel. Several people including myself have used the book. I have heard and received many compliments about how easy it was to follow.I would highly recommend this book.
2,Not Hot Surrender for me,This book was disappointing!! The author left me hanging with questions like:1. Why didn't she say thank you to Connel after he saved her life and was there for her due to her accident?1. What made her act the way she does?2. Why is she such a b**ch and very hard?3. Why does she behave as if she better than everyone?4. Why didn't she want to call the police when Larry tried to kill her but she told Connel she call the police if he didn't leave her house when she encouraged him to kiss and touch her body.I think Zoe has some issues that wasn't mentioned in the books.
2,Not what I expected,"I had been previously satisfied with using the Petmate Litter Locker and its refills for a few years but had to purchase the refill cartridges on-line because my local pet store no longer carried them. These particular cartridges were defective: (1) The plastic liner tube was significantly shorter than the pet store liners -- a little more than 1 fill-up of the locker rather than 2 fill-ups, and (2) the end of the cartridge was not signaled by a black line along the liner. Both of these characteristics will make cleaning the litter box even less glamorous and fun when the unsecured tube of cat droppings falls unexpectedly into the locker, necessitating manual contact of tube contents during cleanup."
3,Great short stories,"I was really looking for a book on real accounts of ghosts in New England. I used to have a book like that, but loaned it to an ex-friend.I really did however enjoy reading this particular book, even though it was not exactly what I was looking for.I would recommend this book to anyone that like to read ghost stories."
5,Wish I'd found these earlier!,"LOVE these diapers! Honestly, I think every little body is built a little differently, and one diaper will not fit every baby perfectly. But these are worth checking out. I tried them looking for a good, cheap diaper and these were recommended by a friend. After reading various reviews I was a little worried, but gave them a go. And I am so glad I did! They have never leaked other than a few overnights, but they sure did put up a fight those nights and even the ""night time"" diapers have had a hard time standing up to my 14 month-old daughter. They are thin, inexpensive and I actually like the smell better than the ""pee smell"" we'd get with others. Only cons- a little crinkly sounding and somewhat transparent (which can be a good or bad thing depending on where you are and what you have). Give them a try, you might be as pleasantly surprised as I was!"
1,Luvs Ultra causes diaper rash,I picked a package of these up a week ago..after one day my 6 month old developed a red rash. I thought it was the wipes but after a few days realized it is the Luvs. They do not hold wetness away from the skin as well as Pampers or Huggies. They may be a dollar or two cheaper but not worth the rash..
4,"Excellent for ""The Artist"".","This piece of work by ""The Artist"" has been ignored too long. Though this piece had been released years previous, it is mesmerizing. The lyrics compelling, and the music addicting, the listener is drawn to it. The story that unfolds in this song is significant, if not important. It is by far one song that should definately be on a greatest hits disc."
2,"Not 4 me, but maybe 4 u","I really enjoyed the acoustic remix of ""7"" and trak # six called ""To Whom it May Concern."" Whoever appreciates the dance side of ""O(+> will dig this or anyone who is obsessed with the overcommercialized ""7."" Not downtrodding it, but it wasn't aquatic enough 4 my anti-radio taste, u know?"
3,i like the mixes better,7 the song never really got my full attention except the lyrics were something else.to whomever it may concern was a direct take to Michael Jackson.the orginal music just didn't cut it for me but the mixes add life to it.Prince is a trip.
5,Amazing Show,"This show is simply amazing! It has an awesome story, the suspence is incredible so is the drama. I recommend this show to those who enjoy drama, action, and suspence!"
4,Who else wants to get sleaved,I was slow coming to the table for this show.. just started season 1 while season 3 is about to come on TV... The show has a way of leaving you upset at the end of every episode .... you may just run through the whole season in just a few days .. so that your not sitting wondering what happens next..
5,An intelligent series,"I can't say enough good things about Prison Break. Finally a series that delivers, with enough intrigue and interest to keep even the most jaded viewer captivated. No review would be complete without giving Wentworth Miller a mention, in a word, delicious!"
5,ACTION PACKED DRAMA,"TERRIFIC DVD SET FOR PRISON BREAK. YOU WILL WATCH IT AGAIN AND AGAIN. CAN'T WAIT FOR THE NEXT SET. AS ALWAYS, THANKS AMAZON FOR SPEEDY DELIVERY. BY THE WAY, MY NEPHEW APPEARS ON THE EPISODE TITLED ""BLUFF""."
4,Fun and crystal clear,What a treat - to view this fun show and see every intricate detail of the protagonist's tatoo in HD ... ! An addictive series.
5,One of the best shows EVER on TV!!!,"LOVE it !!! You must see ! You will love it ! Must watch this fantastic, amazing TV show !!!"
5,This One Caught Us By Surprise!,"The ""crema"" was pretty thick as it brewed, and the coffee appeared to have a nice dark color. We got a nice strong aroma of coffee and preceded to add some milk (1%) and sugar.Our first impressions...good flavor...a nice cup of coffee. We did enjoy the cup of coffeeWe don't know of any other pod maker that has this flavor and it's really good! We love the way it smells - the way it tastes - and the fact it is just plain different. Most pod people are ignoring the flavored sector to this extent - and it's nice to have a cup of really flavored coffee! Review from singleservecoffee.com"
4,"Good story, just don't read preface...","i found the book to be very exciting and fast-paced, but i unfortunately read the preface ""the importance of being Bauchman"" which tells the ending of the book...so i you do decide to read this book, read the preface (which is quite interesting) AFTERWARDS"
4,"Intense, unpredictable, and a fantastic ending!","I am avid reader of Stephen King and this book is definitely one of his best. It can be kind of confusing at first because the book is set in the future. However, King does an excellent job of using his running theme, the media, to illustrate the fascination of popular tv and its connection to human survival."
1,Horrible!,"this is a very disturbing book. it's pointless, with a horrible ending. it might have turned out good if it weren't for the ending. DO NOT READ THIS BOOK! it's terrible, awful."
5,Fast moving and scarily believable,"Set after 2020, I think what makes this story scary is the public's obsession with reality television...and the more gruesome and self destroying the better. In the book the participant is manipulated by the media, making him appear how they want him to appear...even that is scarily realistic!King had amazing foresight to see how mercenary society could become. Okay...so we're not quite so sadistic to watch a game show that hunts people down and kills them but it's not THAT far fetched to imagine a world that would.Great to read a book with a likable character who we can root for and an ending that fits the story."
4,great read..short and intense,"this was so different from the movie, thank god. it is a story about a society out of control and the tv game shows head the pack. one man gets fed up and takes matters into his own hands. if you think this is the movie, you are misguided. do not assume anything. the end is different(i did not like the ending and thats why i only gave it 4 starts. also i liked the long walk better and i gave that 5 stars) as are many other twists. a good read. took me one week. short, sweet and to the point."
2,Couldn't Finish It...,"This is one of the few books I started but didn't finish. It was incredibly depressing and after a while I simply lost interest. I was hoping for a book that would describe more about the strict society in which this story takes place, but I felt that details were lacking. Overall, I don't recommend this book, although it was my first Stephen King read and it's possible that his books are just not my cup of tea."
4,So-So for Jagger; Very good for most authors,"This is not one of my favorites. While Jagger adequately explores the familiar territory of women struggling to survive and thrive in the rapidly changing culture of the Industrial revolution, I do not find the same romantic connection as I do in the Barforth novels. The two heroines, Cara and Emma are intriguing, but the men in the book are flat and lifeless. I found it hard to fall in love with any of them. The change and growth in the main villain was too little too late and one other died offstage it seems just to make room for the supposed hero. I frankly was more interested in exploring a deepening relationship between Tristan and Emma than between Emma and Daniel."
4,Controversial advice!,"Not wanting to damage sales, but I just thought if you are thinking of buying this import, you should know that it's an import of the British release, and as part of the American release, you get the exact same item as this, completely for free, when you buy Magic and Medicine by the Coral. So basically you can get this very exact item for free if you buy the American version of Magic and Medicine. No point buying this whatsoever."
2,Unstable,"I purchased this cot for my dad's 50th birthday. The first time he set it up the whole frame was bent and it had a big dent in one of the legs, could have been caused from shipping because the box was torn up when it arrived? but anyways the whole cot in general was unstable and we were very unsatisfied"
5,Best Nights Sleep Ever!!!,"I have never slept very well camping. I'm 6' 8"" and 240 lbs and always seemed to be on a flat Aero Bed by morning. This cot is the way to go. It is very sturdy and was comfortable sleeping on my back and side. The storage underneath is very handy. You will not want to backpack with this thing...a little too heavy for that. Also, you might not be able to fit as many of these in a tent as it sits up high and so you have to move the cot more towards the center of your tent (if your tent has slanted walls). Very happy and plan to buy another one for my wife the next time my kids force me to go camping again."
1,Are'nt they popular in France?,"I only came to this site to check how many sad arses there are in the world who actually like this band, thank god that most people are sensible enough to realize the bunch of toss this band is. Though I have heard they are popular in France, enough said."
1,I am only writting this to warn others,"This album is only good if you buy albums to sell at a later date when you are a tad short of beer money, as the guy in Andy's record's in Aberystwyth told me, far to late."
5,Just what the doctor ordered,"The orthopaedic surgeon told me to get ankle weights and do 20 or thirty reps for each leg, twice, each day for osteoarthritis in my knees. So I got these. After about a week, I was able to use them at maximum weight. They are just what the doctor ordered."
1,These things are horrible!,"These weights are horrible if you ever actually remove the weight packets to adjust the weights. I bought both the 5 and 10 pound versions and both do the same. It does not matter how gentle you are. the little weight bags split open right off the bat, and when they do they leak grey, gritty, nasty sand everywhere. These are useless! I'm going to end up returning these both the same day they were opened. If there was a zero star option these would get that."
3,So So Product,"You have to be sure and wear socks or something under the weights, because the Velcro straps scratch you quite a bit. Otherwise there ok."
5,gruesome harvest,An excellent overview of the postwar (1945-1948)sell-out of eastern Europe by the allies to J. Stalin.Relates agreements made at meeting like Postdamto the actual destruction of masses of people.Great service and product.
4,A Great Record,This is a great record and is for the music fan who likes fast-paced ska-influenced punk. Features vocals from the late Nick Traina. Recommended.
3,For non science people,"This book is vary basic, definitely for people who have no background in biology. I'm not sure what level she was writing for, because especially in the beginning it was like she was writing for little kids. Also, her description of meiosis was really confusing."
4,Biology,This book is well written and organized. It is useful for the course which I am currently taking at our local community college
2,Yikes!,"They are wonderful looking,but have huge wide heels. I felt like i was wearing flip flops.....Worst part i had to pay to send them back! In this economy thats a definite OUCH!!!"
4,Good substitute,"I think it is a good dvd. I will probably only use it when it is just too hot to get out or raining. I think I would rather do the interval walking outside. Also, the book wants you to work up to 3 sets of 8 with the ab and resistance workout, which the dvd does not do. It is a good dvd and does all of the exercises in the book. I feel that you can't go wrong by purchasing it. It is good to have for everyday or to use as an alternate to your regular plan."
2,not so great,"Good idea, but not so great video. Way too much jumping and lunging- very bad on the knees. Also has some exercises that are hard on the back. Video is also quite boreing and has an uninteresting, low tech backdrop. Was expecting much better..."
5,Great stuff. VDGG returns with a vengeance.,"This album is the one that finally turned me on to VDGG. It's a spooky and emotional roller-coaster ride through Peter Hammill's brain. Now I want to go back and try Pawn Hearts again, which didn't grab me the first time. People who enjoy this may want to try Fripp's ""Exposure"" album, on which Hammill sings a couple of knockout numbers."
3,Not bad!,"This movie was a good story, and definately well acted, but one thing makes it nearly impossible to watch - The little boy! His constant whining & disobedience prooves that there is a point when children need more than a ""time-out"". Luckily, Clooney's performance as the world's coolest dad is quite good, and Pfeiffer is great as a single mom trying to make a living, even though she spends more time on her career then she does disiplining her child."
1,"DOESNT WORK, CRACKED AND LOOKS USED","I received my ""new"" dvd in the mail today. I opened it to find it scratched and cracked! It doesn't even play on my Dvd player. Very unhappy with this product. Most likely not doing business with them again."
3,Not so sharp,"Avid quilters will save money on blade replacement, but I didn't feel it was quite as good as replacing with a new blade."
2,Didn't last long,"These were fun for about 3 tries. After that, various pieces started falling off. The tail and the runners on bottom are poorly attached. Also, the string got worn out and would not recoil easily. I threw them rather than putting them in the toy box."
2,not near as good as i thought it would be,this movie was a big dissapointment. the beginning is good but after that it looses all of its interest.the only reason i even rented it was for katie holmes
1,Helen Mirren will want to forget this role!,"Being a Helen Mirren fan from Prime Suspect, etc. etc. I cannot beleive she actually read the script before accepting the lead? The plot was so ridiculous and riddled with bugs (she's held captive for days in her house tied to her bed ... how does she go to the bathroom? ) I actually thought that maybe a twist was that one of the students might have been her daughter / son but even that plausible diversion was not to be. The ending was absolutely incredibly bad. Compare this graduation ending to the last scene in ""She's All That"" that left one with a wonderful taste of completion and you realize that you have a worthless 90 minutes to get through."
3,A guilty pleasure and pure fun........a good rental!,"Ok, so this isn't the greatest movie ever made, but who doesn't want to get back at an old teacher and blackmai them and tie him or her to a bed? Ok, well maybe just in my imagination...Helen Mirren fabulously plays Mrs. Eve Tingle, a witch of a high school history teacher who loves to belittle her students and she is secretly jealous of them. Her preformance is worth the rental of this alone! She's great!Katie Holmes playes Leigh Ann a hard-working than your average high school student who gets caught with her teacher's final examine in her bag given to her from her loser crush, Luke (who's is her best friends, Jo Lynn's boyfriend).Leigh Ann, Luke, and Jo Lynn go to Mrs. Tingle's house to reason with her but things just get out of the hand and things get interesting! The best part of this movie is when Mrs. Tingle is tied to the bed! I love it!A must see for any movie buff who likes Helen Mirren and/or teen flicks..."
1,Katie Holmes Is a Horrible Actress!,"Everyone, for some reason, loves Katie Homles. Why? Is it because she has a cute little rack? stress on the little. wonder bras do really do wonders. I mean, her talent is as vacant as she is. she is plastic. all the characters she has ever portrayed for very boring and very unconvincing. i don't know who she slept with the get her break, but I would really regret it if i was him.That aside. The movie is loosey based on a novel by Lois Duncan: Killing Mr. Griffin. I have never read the novel, but I know the general idea. Kevin Williams, Please stop ruining books. Yes, I still know what you did last summer, was a good movie. as was the faculty, and scream. but i think you are sent. stop writing."
2,Failed Horror Comedy!,"This movie is just a chain of misfires all the way through. It doesn't work as a horror or suspense movie, but Helen Mirren's over the top performance makes it almost work as a black comedy. Katie Holmes has talent, and has made some good movies (The Ice Storm, Go) but needs to make better career decisions. Helen Mirren is too good an actress for this role, but she ultimately saves the movie. Other than Mirren's performance and a good 'Exorcist' impression by Marisa Coughlan the movie features not much else. From a scale of 1-10 I give this movie a 4!"
2,It has Katie Holmes,"I was really looking forward to this movie. I've loved all the scripts Kevin Williamson has wrote, from Scream to the faculty, and not forgeting Dawson's Creek which I also enjoy a watch of. This fillm was also Williamson's directorial debut, and included the very talented Katie Holmes.So, to be honest I was probably looking for a lot from this movie, did it deliver? Well to be honest its probably unfair to say if it did, or didn't. To me it just could have been a Dawson's Creek episode(ok, maybe if it had been toned down a bit). Holmes was excellent and stole the show, but te film was slow, and never really peaked.Never mind Kevin, I'm sure you're next one will be better. However, its worth a watch."
3,Nothing new in here.,Disappointing book. I think I expected to read something new that I do not find in all the ladies magazines that I get at the grocery store. I didn't find it here.
1,No redeeming quality whatsoever,This film is bizarre. The plot....err wait there is no plot from my point of view. I'm not sure if the director just wanted to throw people off by creating twists that you'd never guess in a million years. But that is the problem. The twists just does not make any sense. There are sexy scenes sure but you can always get another movie with a good story and very nice scenes to boot. Rent this video to see what I mean but don't waste your money on this one.
1,This Movie was AWFUL,"I can't remember being so disappointed in a gay/lesbian movie. The DVD package was really good, and that's what attracted me to the film even though I knew nothing about it. But when I watched it, I found that I was laughing out loud - not at the film itself (which tries to be a quirky dramedy), but because it was so earthshatteringly awful. The acting was bad, the script was worse, and the direction was terrible, as was the music. The only reason I kept watching it was to see just how much worse it could get, and in that respect it didn't disappoint me. What a gross, gross movie."
5,Watch it again and again,"I really loved Nicholas Roeg's film THE MAN WHO FELL TO EARTH starring Daviod Bowie because you had to watch it several times to ""get it"". It's the same deal with NO ORDINARY LOVE. Yeah, there are a lot of subplots, but that makes it all the more interesting to watch the 2nd, 3rd and 4th time around. And the unique thing about this very sexy soap is: you can watch it once normally, and then again with Spanish subtitles (practice your Spanish!) and again with French subtitles (ditto French), and then again with a very interesting commentary by the filmmakers. Then you can isolate all kinds of wonderful moments from the film with the many menus. Somebody put a lot of thought into this DVD --much more than other gay titles I've seen on DVD. It sure won't be something you watch once and then put on the shelf to collect dust."
4,Romantic romp with twists galore,"""No Ordinary Love"" is a delightful experience.It toys with our imaginations and fantasies as the story progresses almost willing it to a conclusion but often just put in for subtle teases..Its funny in parts and perhaps a bit unbelievable in others.The cast is eclectic with the main characters very cute.Overall not a bad watch and you find yourself staying to the end to make sure their is a happy ending...A good movie for the DVD collection.One to enjoy over and over with friends..."
4,"good, loving, qualities","Lust for Life is an extremely well performed video. leaving the viewers actually want to hit the mountain and pull some ...360's or bak flips. with great musik and sum of the greatest riders to ever hit the slopes, L.F.L. is perfect. i didnt like though the lack of shos for the boarders. if ur gonna show like B.J. Leines give him summore clip-time. other than the shortness L.F.L. was by far one of the greatest film of the 90's"
1,Clarinet Case,"A bit small. Was concerned the clarinet is being smashed into the case. In the end it works, but felt it was too expensive for what I got."
4,important to have,"first heard about it actually on YOUTUBE.Different parents posted their videos of their baby infants swimming, or turning themselves over floating.It was so touching and amazing to see. So many of the parents said they learned from Douglas Domans book. Having a pool and canals all over the area where I live, it is sooo important for kids to learn swimming as early as possible.Book is nice with tips on fun bonding exercises to do with baby starting after birth."
2,not so good,"this book is only good if you started teaching your baby to swim when he was a newborn and it doesn't give many different choices. had some helpful tips, but overall I think I'll buy another one. my recommendation...skip it"
1,Skip this impractical book and get something else,"The program is tedious and impractical. Tells you that you are better off with a Japanese tub to practice in, and requires lot of practice from you and baby on daily basis. There are other fun and simple programs out there that would teach your baby to swim, float, turn and breathe out of water and this is definitely not the one with a simple solution."
1,"No ampere rating provided, so no purchase possible.","We are all familiar with these glass cartridge fuses.We all need at least 2 pieces of information: the physical size, and the ampere rating.The ampere rating is missing here, so no purchase is possible. Duh.You can give the series: these are series AGW. Figuring out the series is often impossible for us, but we can all measure the size. So just say these are 1/4"" x 7/8"".After size and ampere rating, everything else is gravy -- slow blow, fast acting. Most fuses under 1Amp are fast acting anyway.BOTTOM LINE: give the amps or forget about the sale.--jerry-VA"
3,Interesting,"A fascinating read on evidence that Jesus appeared in England, as well as many other assertions, and although I'm not convinced, I admit that the evidence is so specific and detailed that it would be hard to dispute. The first half of the book was most interesting however, in the second half, I felt the author became very arrogant and the book took on a personal agenda. Would like to research his claims more thoroughly myself but until then, who can resist being well entertained on a thought provoking subject?"
3,Disappointed Wilber Fan,"My first exposure to Ken Wilber was his Brief History of Everything, a book of incredible depth and scope, so I was disappointed when reading History of Everything to come across to glaring errors the first time I sat down with it. The first was his claim that only living things reproduce themselves. This is simply wrong; crystals, for instance, reproduce under the right conditions, and a proper mineral solution may be ""seeded"" with the crystal that one intends to grow. The second incorrect claim he made was that natural selection is not a strong enough force to explain the evolution of life on earth, in particular that is insufficient to explain the jump from Earth's early ""primordial soup"" to the earliest forms of life. For those who insist that Wilber is correct in this claim, I reccomend the works of Richard Dawson, a brilliant evolutionary biologist."
1,Don't waste your time,A half-baked premise using made up words in an annoying Q&A format. The worst book I have read in five years.
1,"A cynical, biased, and disappointing book.","There is a fine line between true wit and cynicism. In this book, the normally witty Chesterton comes across as a cynical old man who longs for the good old days of medieval England when we had popes and kings and queens and guilds and common lands. He is quite snobbish in his rant against contemporary snobs, and he is anti-Protestant and anti-modern to the point of being tiresome.Chesterton actually viewed the English Reformation as nothing more than a power grab by the wealthy. He conveniently downplays the corruption and tyranny of the Roman Catholic Church throughout these centuries. He seems to think that the history of England is a downward slide since the days of the Middle Ages. Indeed, Chesterton was a Catholic medievalist who is still worshiped by Catholic medievalists today.Despite some nice sections, particularly on the Puritans, this book is tiresome and delusional."
4,An Excellent Collection of Personal Testimonials,"As a woman who has returned to the Catholic Church after having left and experimented with other forms of worship, including New Age beliefs, I found myself identifying strongly with the 17 women who have related their stories here. For a woman struggling with secular issues that have been misapplied to matters of faith, this is a particularly helpful read; it puts you in touch with matters of faith, rather than matters of political correctness, delivering an over-riding message that we only transcend the world by looking at things through sacramental, ""godly"" eyes, not worldly ones. I thought the first essay was rather weak, and the writer a bit full of herself, but after that each essay was more and more compelling. Highly Recommend."
4,wonderful cd,"I realy like this music. I would say it is fresh, evocitave, and exotic. I enjoy it alot! I look forward to more of Lynette Westendorf music."
3,Not the reissue we hoped for,"Don't get me wrong -- this is a terrific album. Produced by Carl Wilson during his creative peak, it's essential for anyone who treasures the Beach Boys' ""Holland"" period when Blondie Chaplin and Ricky Fataar were in the band.But the issue is sound quality. This isn't a digital transfer from Steve Desper's shimmering master tape, but a heavily compressed needle-drop from vinyl -- and the vinyl didn't sound that good to begin with. The Beach Boys organization, which holds the rights to this album and a never-issued follow-up, apparently thwarted earlier proposals for a legitimate release."
4,Love it. Wish it had a carry-on strap,"This mat is really good for exercises. I have a bad back and need to do floor exercises for it. Recently I took it to a yoga class and realized that it would be awesome for this mat to have a sling/ strap to carry it with, but it's a great mat all the same!"
2,dimples all over the mat,"I have purchased a Valeo mat and notice that my mat had a whole ton of dimples on the surface of the mat. It is disappointing to have bought new mat with dimples. My cousin has two Valeo mats for a long time, his has no dimples on it, it looks and feels better than the one I received even though it is the same brand."
4,"not as good as the first, but it is an EP so I forgive em",the only reason it doesnt match up to 17 reasons is because its to short.its still good quality punk rock and ska
5,Dead Doll is one crazy movie full of outhouse rat type crazy folks!,"Looking for crazy, disturbing, reality type horror? Dead Doll has all of that with a pinch of insane! It's a polarizing movie. You either love it or hate it. It may be the only movie I've ever seen where all the main characters are completely worthless human beings."
2,Not what I thought,"After reading this I was disappointed. This was not really a western. Just one of Ed Gorman`s mysteries wrapped up to pass it`s self off as a western. Time to saddle up and find real westerns by Charles West, Ralph Cotton or Elmore Leonard. These gentleman know what westerns are all about."
5,Steve Hillage - 'Live Herald' (Caroline),"Even better than his 'BBC Radio One Live' disc (see my review) although both releases SHOULD be had by all Hillage / Gong fans. Was recorded at two separate gigs from March, 1977 and August, 1978. The overall sound quality of 'Live Herald' is superb and Hillage's playing is both spontaneous and brilliant. Total of seven tracks with a duration of 64:14. Tunes I enjoyed the most are the opener ""Salmon Song"", the well-written ""The Dervish-Castle In The Clouds-Hurdy Gurdy Man"", ""Electrick Gypsies"" and the fifteen-minute epic (love these lengthy tracks) ""Lunar Music Suite"", which features a great guitar solo that just may make it necessary for die hards to keep a wetnap handy. Recommended."
4,Fun Film,"Sick Nurses doesn't look to be accomplishing anything more than producing an eye-catching, bloody, fun bit of horror. The ghost is fairly standard asian fare (except in black face as opposed to the classic white), but the gore and blood get pushed up a notch and the eye candy factor is impressive enough to separate Sick Nurses from the average asian scare. It reminded me of Infection and Autopsy (non-asian) in setting: a fairly abandoned hospital, bereft of any presence other than the half-dozen or so main characters. It's hard to take too seriously or suspend much disbelief, yet the kills are fairly innovative and suitably gruesome in parts, and I was entertained from start to finish. I'll give it 3 1/2 stars."
4,Cool,"I was expecting something far worse from the title, but am a fan of Asian horror and thought I'd try it out. I was pleasantly surprised. I thought it was one of the coolest and most justified villains I've seen in years. Each nurse had customized consequences and the ending was amazing. It greatly equaled the story."
4,On point and good guidance,"Reporting has become the fourth ""R"" in education right after reading, `riting, and `rithmatic. ""Refining Common Sense"" helps very busy educators consider how data needs to be organized, stored, and retrieved in order to help ease the burden of that ""4th R."" More importantly, the book outlines the steps needed for providing the data so that informed curricular and instructional decisions can be made. You may know the questions to ask and the steps to take but having them already clearly delineated for you saves a bunch of time."
2,I only tolerate tutorial books that are clear,"When you're a beginner, and obviously one usually is when reading this type of material, you can't afford to waste time and energy reading 3 or 4 books to compensate for their flaws. You want one solid one that can quickly get you up to speed without tripping you up. I found the writing style to be awkward and perhaps it is the more formal British writing style. The material seems to be comprehensive but unfortunately the explanations are too brief. I found that I understood some stuff only because I have read other OOP and algorithm texts, and for a newbie without that background this book would be rather confusing. I might give it 3 stars but someone gave it 5 so I want to even it out immediately."
3,Northern Climates Preferred,"Stephen Scanniello is a good ole New Yorker, and his reviews of these climbing roses are based on northern climates. I am located in CA. While some of the information was equally as relevant, the general focus is for Northern gardeners."
5,Family fun w/ 4 DVDS,"My wife and I grew up on the Muppetts in the 70s. Turns out our kids dig them too. I wish I could have found a used copy, but worth the $30 for 4 dvds and shipping. We watch it all the time, enjoy."
4,This is truly a CD worth adding to your personal collection!,"I loved every track on this CD, which is a rarity!"
2,Not what I thought it would be,"Written in the early 1960s I thought this was going to be one of this predictive/warning type books from an old fashioned right winger/John Bircher type. From what I can tell that really wasn't the world view of this guy. What he does predict most is off, some he gets right. Some of the really wacky stuff is that China nor India would never be a world economic power and Israel would join a union with other Arab nations. Some of what he gets right is the creation of something like the EU and that governments would push the mixing and intermarrying of different races. The biggest thing that he missed was that the big plan is that soveriegn nations would be a thing of the past and all these countries that at least on the surface were at each others throats are now interlocked and interdependent on each other at the high levels. Its the new world order."
3,Could have been done in 30 pages,"While there are serious, helpful suggestions in this book, the author often times seems to be just making things up. He goes on and on about all the excuses people have for not writing, like the supposed 'negative self-talk.'For example, p121: ""So far as I can see, successful writers who remain physically and emotionally healthy rarely relapse."" This is an unfalsifiable claim; the author includes no data to back up this reasoning, only anecdotal evidence. Much of this book is written in this fashion.What most annoyed me about Professors as Writers was the pretense of research. The author repeatedly 'cites' data which would never be publishable in a scientific journal - in other words, it's unreliable and unfalsifiable. Several vague references to 'ongoing research' are used to strengthen arguments, but this is really just code for ""data does not yet support my claims, but I hope it will someday."""
4,Excellent book,"I am halfway complete with my first textbook project.I purchased this book and ""How to Write a Lot"" at the same time. The latter I should have returned, but this one is very good.. Good ideas.. puts writing into perspective. Easy reading. The analysis and suggestions regarding writers block were very helpful."
4,A GOOD COMPILATION BUT...,"This is a good compilation but I think she should have included the 'super' song ""PONLE REMEDIO"", that song is great! and she didn't included in any format( CD or CD+DVD).She should also have included ""Gracias a dios"" ""Amándote"" or ""Por amor"" or the 3 songs.The previously unrealised song ""Acción y reacción"" and ""Cuando tú me tocas"" are pretty good songs( especially ""ACCIÓN Y REACCIÓN"").I especially like ""Rosalinda"", ""Entre el mar y 1 estrella"" ""Regresa a mi"" and ""Piel morena""Never the less I recommend it. I'TS A GOOD CD, Buy it."
5,The Rainbow Fish,The book is great for teaching toddlers to share and be kind to others. The illustrations are beautiful and it is well written. I dont think it was meant as a political statement for 2 year olds.
1,Marxism for Kids,This book is nothing more than the Communist Manifesto dumbed down into language that children can understand.
1,Bad Lessons for children,"This book sets horrible examples and lessons for children. The Rainbow fish is ostracized by the other bratty fishes, until it finally gives up parts of its scaly self to these mean fishes just to be able to get along. I didn't like it at all.Reading the positive reviews and their ""carping"" (pun intended) about those who have left the serious reviews that point out these glaring problem, I think this book must have been made some kind of showcase item for people who think that the collective is superior to individuals.I really think this book is bad for children's self esteem. It doesn't give a positive message such as we should respect people's differences. It says to a kid that you should merge with all the others. There is no good reason for the Rainbow fish to rip off parts of his body to give to those other fishes who are mean to him. I mean they were the maladjusted ones, not the Rainbow Fish. Leave the Rainbow Fish alone!"
3,Get a Grip,"My husband hates this book, and I was undecided. But after hearing the points in some of the positive reviews, I now agree that adults are over-thinking this very simple message. If the Rainbow Fish were a person - he would be selfless Mother Theresa instead of haughty Paris Hilton ... and I would rather my girls be influenced by the teachings of the former. Would have given it a four, but I don't think the illustrations are that great."
2,What is it really teaching?,"This book starts out talking about a beautiful fish with shiny scales, who refuses to give his scales away, when asked to by a random smaller fish. Because of his refusal he becomes lonely as no one wants to be around him, until gives away his scales and has many friends due to his sharing and generosity.As a parent I understand the need to teach our children to share, and to be giving. However, The Rainbow Fish goes a bit beyond that, telling a story where you are not able to have friends unless you give them gifts. It reminds me of a very lonely child at school who gives people things so others will like him. On the up-side it does speak of the happiness that can be found in giving things to others (Why I gave it two stars) and the illustrations are very captivating - especially for toddlers and infants.Overall I would Not recommend this book to other parents, even with all the pretty pictures."
2,Pretty pictures but terrible message,"Am I the only one in the world who hates the Rainbow Fish's message, i.e., that one has to buy friends by giving them the things one cherishes most? Sure, the watercolor-like pictures with the shiny, glittery scales are pretty, but I don't want my kids absorbing the moral that friends will like you if you give them stuff, as opposed to them liking you for who you are. I'm all for encouraging young children to share and to think of others' feelings -- but this socialist fish is for the birds!"
5,wonderful,"what a great story of learning to share and making friends, my children love the foil detail on each page and ask to hear it nearly every day. terrific book, should be a part of every collection"
1,Terrible book,"This book is simply terrible. It claims to be about sharing, but the real message is that you can buy friends if you give them gifts. It also teaches children that fish can remove their scales and attach them to other fish. While adults know this is rediculous, children think they have just learned something new. I would be thoroughly embarrassed if I were the author of the book to have my name on it. Seriously."
1,The anti-value book,"This book preaches conformity and enforces that different is bad. I will NOT allow my children to read this trash. Each and every person and animal on this planet is different, and for someone to actually waste the paper to publish a book like this absolutely disgusts me. Differences should be accepted or even celebrated. This book teaches the very opposite.What a waste."
1,Selfish Fish Demand Payment for Friendship,"Won't you take off those protective scales that grow on you so that I might look good wearing them. NO? Then not only will I not talk to you any more, but I will go and tell everyone else that they should not have anything to do with you either. If you want to be my friend, you'll have to give up whatever you like about yourself, give in to my demands, and follow me.Of course sharing is good and right, but sharing is not in response to demands that say ""Give me what I want or I'll make your life miserable."" The positive feeling that comes from giving should be about doing what is right, not about buying friends or paying off enemies."
2,"Sick values, great pictures","This book puts forth a sick message that friendship must be bought at the price of their unique advantages and talents, that conformity and uniformity are prime values. The ending -- in which the Rainbow Fish, having given away all but one of his scales, ends up the happiest fish in the sea for having as many ""friends"" (who are only friends because he paid them) as the other fish -- is horrible, suggesting to children that happiness comes through buying ""friends,"" conformity and monotony. The inevitable subsequent plight of the former Rainbow Fish when his ""friends"" realize he no longer has anything to give them is left untold and unrealized. The message this book sends to children is a life-destroying evil one.That having been said, the pictures are really good, and maybe the message of the book will be ignored for the pictures, which is what gives it 2 stars rather than 1."
1,It's a bore.,"The story in this book plods along. Even for little kids, it's very ""preachy."" My children enjoyed the shiny fish scales much more than the story. This book was a disappointment. It just goes to show, don't judge a book by its cover."
5,You Can't Go Wrong,Old School Hip Hop at its VERY best. The tracks are timeless and beats and lyrics still can't be topped!
5,A totally kick-butt hip hop album,"Definitely more mellow than Public Enemy, I ranked this rap album as the bomb. With pro-Black nationalism their anger is more suppressed than Chuck D, and this classic deserves a closer look than what most reviewers tend to reward Brand Nubian. Plus, I wondered where did they sample all that funky stuff eh?"
2,Something's missing...,"I'm a big RB fan but I was dissappointed with this release. I just don't hear the quality in the songwriting this time. Everything sounds forced and plastic to me.I read concerns from fans over the female drummer but the drums sound solid to me. Not an issue at all. Just no catchy songs.The thing that I think made RB great was that they took what AC/DC was before they became a caricature of themselves and made it better. Albums brimming with swagger and raw energy from top to bottom.I hate to put anything negative down about such a great band but, since I tend to check the customer reviews before I buy, my advice is: buy any one of (or all three of) the previous releases: Pain, Get Used To It, Rhino Bucket. If you're reading this I'll be shocked if you don't love them. Skip this album. Hopefully there will be a next one and it will be better. And....definitely see them live if you get a chance. Like most great bands, the recording is just a shadow of what they are."
5,The best Bucket album ever!!,"It was about time these dudes recorded these tunes I've been checking them out live since '01 in SoCal and Texas and with all due respect to the old timers(I love the old stuff too) these are the best songs they have ever done!I saw them at Rocklahoma this summer with thier old drummer Simon Wright(AC/DC,UFO,Dio)back on drums and they stole the show!(Queensryche and Jackal were awesome 2).There coming back on tour with Simon on drums again next month and you know I'm there."
4,good ol' ska punk.,"i bought the album before i went to work one day.and when i got to work i put it in.just to piss my boss off becuase he hates ska. but as i was working and listening i liked what i heard but wasnt really paying attention. but when i got home and really listened i liked it alot. its a good quality record good music. if you like slapstick, less than jake or mustard plug you'll like these guys"
1,Could be so much better than it is!,"Although the book, with its illustrations, sidebars and accompanying cd, seemed so promising, in the end this is a disappointing compilation. The book and cd waste a lot of space with some of the most commonplace forms of poetry - Mother Goose rhymes and limericks - to which many parents will have already introduced their children. The book veers from nursery rhymes to multiple poems involving death to Shakespearean sonnets. The choices of poems within each form introduced could have been improved upon - many are downright uninteresting. Finally, I reached for the CD, hoping the purchase could be saved by the careful, luscious reading of selected excellent examples on it. Alas, alack. Two ""professional"" actors read - neither, unfortunately, possessing either the gravitas or the tonal depth to make the poems ring. And again, the cd is littered with limericks and nursery rhymes."
5,Beautiful Pictures,"These are some really beautiful pictures of wild animals I have seen. It has been a fantastic tool to have, also. My daughter was doing a report for school on giraffes, and this fit perfectly. I have been very pleased with this book and intend to buy more stained glass coloring books in the future."
3,"Want work in an old pentium II pc, but...","Can't seem to get it to work in an old pentium II pc, but it does seem to work in a celeron pc. I'm somewhat happy with this item."
4,ATI Rage XL 8MB PCI Video Card,"Works as specified however, received item with the box squeezed flat and driver cd broken."
5,GOT THIS BOOK AT BORDERS BOOKSIGNING ... ITS COOL ...,"My Dad took me and my brothers to Borders for a Teacher's event. The lady who wrote Toonies was there. Wile Dad talked to her, we began shoving each other to get a good look at the funny old man and the kid on the cover of Toonies.Dad ended up buying one. Since I'm the oldest, I got to read it first. I really loved the fun adventures the real kids had with the Toonies and all the places in Silicon Valley they went to. The Children's Discovry Musem is one of my favrite places, so it was fun when the bad Toonie flew around there and got bonked on the head by a homeless old lady.It was a fun book to read. My brothers think so to.Brendan from Los Gatos, California"
5,a great read with hidden messages,"This is an easy read with messages throughout. I liked how the author connected each character with different storylines. While reading the book, we are able to see the characters grow and accept their strenghs and weaknesses. Mrs. Bryant-Woolridge is a talented author. Read it and you won't be disappointed."
5,Fabulous 1980's Spyro Gyra,"If you liked Point of View and Rites of Summer, you will love this CD. To me the late 80's were the high point for Spyro Gyra. They had a refined, tight, jazzy sound. They are still great, but the additions of vocal numbers and mainstream ""smooth jazz"" influences have taken their toll. Listen to Fast Forward a few times and it will get keep getting better and better."
1,Worthless product,"After 40+ years of owning several excellent white Swing Away wall canopeners, we needed to replace the last one. This brand new Swing Away wall can opener, purchased from Amazon, is WORTHLESS!! It will not open even one can without skipping and rolling off the can. The company should be ashamed of selling such a worthless product! It deserves a rating of MINUS 5 stars."
2,Impressive at first then depressive later on.,"My mother used one of these wall mounted can openers when I was a child. When our manual opener broke about a year ago, I found that Amazon carried openers that looked like what I remembered. I ordered one and was impressed with its operation until after 10 cans or so when it began to ride up and out of the 'groove' leaving the lid only partially cut. There are no adjustments and trying to keep the cutter in the groove was not successful. Looking at the experiences of others with this product on Amazon, I found they had the same problem. In hunting for other manufacturers, I did not find any. Seems the openers are now made in China and the quality seems to have suffered. It amazes me that it appears there is only one manufacturer for this product. It is disappointing because it really is much easier to open cans on a wall mount (that works)."
1,"This could be a great CanOpener, but it isn't","I bought this Can Opener for my wife who has difficulty opening cans with a standard thumb twist can opener, and I got tired of replacing batteries in our cordless. The wall mount concept is perfect since it keeps one less appliance from the countertop. The long handle was easy to operate; however the cutting wheel is insufficient, or the clamping jaw doesn't close enough to properly open a can. With a single rotation the can is cut in some areas, but not enough to open it. After multiple rotations (4-5x around the can) the opener typically opens the can enough to get the top off.I do not reccomemd this product, simply because it does not open cans sufficiently."
3,Doesn't last.,"Worked great when it was new, but after a few years of moderate home use this can opener is pretty much shot. I guess they don't make them like they used to."
5,easy to use can opener,My family has had this type of can opener since I was a child. When I couldn't find one around where I live I went to Amazon. I knew if they were still being made that I would find on here. It opens any size can. Easy to mount on the wall. I love it.
5,Wall mounted Swing-A-Way Can Opener,"After decades of use we needed to replace our swing-a-way can opener. We did not have the extra counter space needed for an electric can opener. I searched chain stores like Bed-Bath-and Beyond, Linens and Things etc for this simple but effective mechanical can-opener before finding it at Amazon.com. I bought an extra one to give away. An excellent product."
5,Best read in years,"What a mouth-watering piece of writing! It has been years since I read such a wonderful book. I can't recall the last time I was aware of the shrinking number of pages remaining as I read the story, regreting that I was nearing the end.MacLeod has created a rich and detailed world inhabited by a Scottish clan come to Nova Scotia (Cape Breton in particular). He dances back and forth through time without ever seeming gimmicky. Moments of insight slip in with the gentleness of a falling autumn leaf."
1,cliched and dreary,"I'm not going to harp on about the failings of this novel(which I hasten to add I only finished as I was asked to review it elsewhere)but please bear in mind before you accept as gospel the glowing praise this has earnt elsewhere (including from Booker Prize winning novelists who should know better) that the opening lines actually liken an autumn morning to 'a Keats poem'. I am staggered that anyone can publish a book which displays such a lazy and banal opening and wish that both the publisher and I could have stopped right there. I resented every minute I had to spend reading this turgid, self regarding, badly written prose."
2,xr200r book,I found this book to be somewhat helpful. I had to do a total rebuild on my bike this book helps with some of the harder disasembly but stops short of the total process. you may find youself on your own with some of the seemingly harder things like crank removal. The annoying take to a authorized dealer is seen far too much i think in this book. They sugest it and and don't really help by showing you pictures or describing alignment of much needed things like counter balancer placement. But so far this is the only book i have come across for this bike if you can find a honda shop manual you would be better off.
2,Confusing mix of years and models,"While I use Clymers a lot, this is one of the most hard to follow repair books of theirs I have ever read. It is so confusing because of the mix of years and models cramed into this version with enough variation between the different bikes and years that it's tough to follow. I purchased this manual to help me figure out some repairs on my 1991 XR 250L and it's not really useful because of how the manual does not differentiate some of the differences between dual sport L and dirt R versions or clearly state areas where they are the same, e.g. gearing is one of those areas."
5,wow this was good,Wow this is worth every penny i spent.It starts off with a bang and keeps going.VERY good writer.I really enjoyed this and my only disappointment is: it finished.
2,Stay Away Joe,"I purchased this movie because it was the last movie of Elvis's that I did not have and I wanted a collection of all of his movies. I did not like this movie but I still wanted it to complete my collection. I am an Elvis fan and always have been, and I also have a lot his documentaries, so I am happy to have this last movie. Would I recommend this movie? To a real Elvis fan, yes, but to someone wanting to see a good movie, no."
3,"It's a Weird Scene, Man!","Apart from the unfortunate Native American stereotypes, ""Stay Away, Joe"" (1968) features one of Elvis' most engaging performances in this party-hardy farce. Nice Sedona photography and remarkably few songs. A strange film to be sure, but the King certainly made worse."
4,Lovely Story,"I enjoyed reading this book, but found that it left me with questions. One of which, was stated on the blurb, that ""Arnrings' past begins to unravel, revealing a shattering secret that reaches back nearly a century"". IT DIDN'T HAPPEN. I kept waiting for something spectacular to come out, but there was nothing there. If they meant the fact that he was illegitimate that appears in the beginning of the book. It also states that he went west....but he ended up in Texas??? I adore Ms Plain's books and will forever keep on reading them, but these mistakes should be caught before publication.Actually the book is stated as a generational book, but it takes us 310 pages with Adam's story, and leaves us with only 46 pages of the next two generations. I was confused with the story of Mr. Snow (Leo). It states that he picked up the litter of puppies abandoned beside the road, and it was in fact Adam's mother Eileen."
2,Head trauma,"People are full of surprises. We know someone for a time and think we understand what they're all about, and then there's the WTF moment of I never really knew you at all. So let's have a compassion-fest, okay? Repeat ad infinitum.The Plain Style is plainly to hit you over the head with her message. You'll see the stars alright-- with every blow landed! I fear I have a concussion.It's a shame that the people who added drama to the book, Blanche the ""brother-killing"" ho-ho-ho, and Leo the creepy, angry blackmailing so-and-so, were given so little space to work their black magic. Coulda been good times, I tell ya."
3,Hard to get into at first,"I tried reading this once, and couldn't get into it all. I forced myself to try again and it was difficult but once I did finally get into it, I ended up enjoying this book. I liked the time period and historical setting. If I had one word to describe the novel I would use the word mellow. It's a nice, smooth read with no huge attention grabbers. I've read a couple of thrillers lately and this one kind of balanced things out. Might be a good book to take to the beach or read on a lazy weekend, but not good if you're looking for anything with a lot of excitement."
1,Don't count on getting the color(s) you want.,"I ordered 3 sets of these:Chinese embroidered snap / zipper pouch set of 3 - assorted colors (#97)(3 per set, total of 9, in 5 different colors), although I only needed one pouch, just to make sure I got at least one of the gold, which was the color I needed. Among the 9 sent, I got not a single gold! Very disappointing. If the manufacturer is out of a particular color, better to notify the buyer and let them wait, if they choose; OR, better yet, offer the option of 3 of the same color, even if at a slightly higher price."
5,Super Value on High Quality Gear!,Great value and fine quality yoga gear. Good whether you're a beginner or seasoned professional. You always need the basics. Go for it!
2,Very thin mat,I guess if you buy a product that is 'all in one' you pay the price by lacking quality within the package.
2,"Good Kit, bad mat","I bought this kit to do yoga at home, since I've been with an instructor for a while. I wanted something with blocks and strap for modifications, plus a mat to keep at home. This kit looked like everything I wanted in one go.The blocks are nice, great size and texture, the strap is basic but nice, heavy duty. The only problem is the mat itself.The mat is smelly, which will probably wear off with use, and it's a bit narrow. But the worst part is that it's not sticky. It's SLIPPERY. Imagine my surprise when I moved into downward-dog pose and almost fell flat on my face because I couldn't get my hands or feet to stop slipping!! I ended up throwing the mat to the side and finishing my practice without it.Now I have to run to the store and buy a $15 Gaiam mat. I would never recommend this brand of mat. Stick to Gaiam."
4,Great gift,Great gift idea for someone who is thinking about getting into yoga or just started yoga.
2,Strong chemical smell!,"Strong chemical smell from the mat causes my nose to run. I hope that wears off, or I can wash it away, otherwise it the mat will be useless. The bag is quite thin and will likely wear out quickly, the blocks and belt appear to be very durable and may be worth the money for the whole kit.Time will tell"
5,Patti Austin's best outing for GRP,"Already a fine soul practitioner for years before, Patti Austin's jazz stylings began to get more prominent towards the end of the 80s, so perhaps it wasn't too surprising that she moved to one of the 90s most well-known major labels for jazz, but in this case it hardly means a dramatic stylistic change. This album, one of the most vocally robust that Patti has made, features a fine mix of jazzy ballads and highly stylized pop pleasures that do a great job of keeping in touch with her 80s roots without leaving her too stuck in the past. ""In My Life"" and ""Wait For Me"" give her a chance to flex her rich vocals against some spare, haunting backgrounds, ""Good In Love"" and ""In My Dream"" add some nice pop stylings, and ""Too Soon To Know"" is a catchy, uptempo number that seems to build on the formula of her 1981 dance hit ""Do You Love Me."""
1,Love is gonna getcha,"Good deal, actually only one song on entire CD worth listening to. Saved one song, discarded all others"
5,Many Important Ideas,"This book has so many useful ideas it is hard to know where to begin. I decided to pick up a copy last week when I saw the author on Television.I am glad I got it. I don't play in tournaments yet, but I am glad I got this book before setting foot in one. That way I know I will be ready!"
4,Pretty good!,"Review by a 13-year-oldThis is a pretty good book, although I haven't finished it yet. It gives a lot of information and gives a lot of advice. I learned a lot of rules from this book, pyschology, and more!One thing that I would like, however, is a lot more of stuff on endgames, and less on openings. I think that learning about the endgame is a lot more important than memorizing openings.But aside from some things, I really like this book. It's nice to be able to plop down on the couch and review things from it without having to set up a chess board."
3,Not good,"My daughter loves Pixel Chix and we have bought a few of the single Pixel Chix and had no problems, at this time we have purchased 3 Pixel Chix Roomies and the first 2 didnt work after a few days, I didnt bother to try and return, we had thrown away all boxes and wrapping, so we purchased a third, so far so good. I wouldnt reccommend buying though. Nothing against the seller, shipment was great, price was great, but product is not one that works for very long.Side note: The extra roomies are expensive"
4,Pixel Chix Christmas,"This toy has been a big hit with my daughter. She loves it and can spend an hour or more pretending and creating stories with it. This was the only thing she asked for, and it has lived up to her expectation."
3,Pixel Chix fun but poor performance,"My daughter loves this. However, as soon as we got it, we had to replace the batteries. Again, we replaced the batteries, but it doesn't work. Now we have to send it back. For the price of about $[...] with shipping, it is very disappointing, especially since we bought another roomie in the interim."
1,Digital Transformation - makes poor loo paper,Very disappointed. I agree with one of the previous reviews. It's full of things I could pick up from magazines and full of cliches. Expected a lot more. Read it in a couple of hours (on and off). Waste of money.
1,Shallow and misses the mark,This book is shallow and short. I read it in less than 2 hours. The type is double-spaced and the book is full of blank pages. This is how it gets to 125 pages.It does not even scratch the surface of e-business and discusses concepts at the level of someone who has never read an ounce about business. I found it unchallenging and uninformative.
5,"Stylist, and very functional.","I have no idea why this scale was rated so poorly. I love it! I changed from the weight watchers scale to this, and I couldn't be happier!"
1,Unbelievable piece of junk,The first one we got broke within seconds of turning it on - the display just showed some abstract segments of the LCD. The second one seemed to work but could not be changed from reading in kilos - yes we removed the battery as per the instructions. These scales claim German engineering but they are in fact made in China and are really cheaply made - don't waste your money.
1,Machine stopped working properly,"I got the machine for my fat, muscle and water analysis as well as my weight. After 1 month of use it only shows the weight. The scale no longer works properly. It no longer shows anything else but the weight. It was a waste of money."
1,Bring Back Baby Chaos,"Baby Chaos was the first band I ever saw live in about 93-94, thus I always followed the band even after the band broke up. I bought the EP, which was waaay better than this full length, which, frankly, pretty much sucks. I like some softer music, but this is ridiculous. Way too soft for me. Radiohead is metal compared to this."
3,"Stereodreamscene, a love album","This new album is much lighter than the days of Baby Chaos. It does contain great vocals and imaginitative music, but something is missing. I listened for a while, and found what the problem is. Deckard is trying to find their nitch, and stereodreamscene is lighter than they expected. There are powerful songs, but I will only rave about the #1 track: ""What Reason"", the rest is confusion mixed with emotion, covered with too many pretty notes. Be ready for something different when buyin this CD."
2,Emotional Britpop with an alt-rock touch,"The latest UK entry into the break in America sweepstakes is Deckard, a Scottish quartet that does little to distinguish itself on its full-length debut. This should make this well-meaning band's foray into America a rocky one, unless their self-proclaimed killer live shows or a freak radio hit swoops in to save the day."
1,A complete disappointment,"This is the first book I read by Jose Saramago. I read it in English. Absent a disastrous translation, it has been a total disappointment so far. I have read 236 pages (out of 306 pages the book has) and it has failed to capture my interest. I have kept reading just in case something interesting happens. But nothing so far. The book lacks the virtuosity and the imagination you would expect from a Nobel Prize winner. The book is about the plot 95% of the time. The psychology of the main characters is practically absent. There are no personal conflicts worth mentioning. This is a very shallow book. After I finish reading this book, I will give Saramago another try. But after reading ""Seeing"" I will less forgiving with a second book."
4,Best CD of the GRP Collection,"This Christmas Collection was recommended by a friend and colleague when I asked about recommended jazz Christmas music. This cd, the first in the collection, is certainly the best volume. I ordered it not only in CD but also in vinyl which I intend to gift to friends of our for their holiday party. Overall, I would highly recommend this cd. I am certain it will be a staple this December as we get in the Christmas spirit."
5,I didn't want to give it as a present.,Just like the 'big boys' have. Good solid Blackjack game and my nephew will appreciate the Hint button which tells player what is best to do.
3,An average release from a MC that is capable of so much more,"Del is one of the illest MCs to come along in years, however this is not anywhere near of what he is capable of producing. Of course Del comes with the lyrics, but as with so many other releases, the producton is what holds this album back. Deltron 3030 was such a great album because it perfectly blended Del's lyrics with equally great beats provided by the Automator. I would love to see another collaboration betweent these 2. I will continue to support Del and buy his music, and you should too, but this is not Del's best at all. I am yet to hear Del's latest release, hopefully it's up to his potential."
4,shows its age but still a great release,if I could describe this album in one word it would be great. Great production and pretty good Mc skills the beats are starting to show their age but this is a good intro to one of heirogliphics most talented producers. The only gripe I have with this CD is that Del takes up 75% of the album covering the same subject matter of taking out wack MCs now I dont mind this when its done creatively but here it gets a little boring other than that this album diserves nothing less than four mics.
3,Rutherford B. Hayes presentation done!,"My son had to be Rutherford B Hayes for a President's Day presentation. Rather than running across town to the costume shop, I used my Amazon App to purchase this beard. It was a very cheap purchase and thus the quality was cheap but it got the job done. The beard sheds, needed some trimming and was slightly torn."
3,Uncomfortable,"My son used this for a Stonewall Jackson costume and while it did work for that purpose, he indicated it was very uncomfortable and not made real well. I can't complain too much, though, for the price, it worked."
5,I really like this DVD!,"I just picked this DVD up. I skimmed through it once, watching the hit songs. But it was when I really watched it all the way throught that I discovered how really good it is. Some of the songs I was not familiar with are among the best on the DVD, particularly John Prine's ""Sam Stone"" and also ""Let Him Roll"". I was glad to see ""The Fourth Man"" on the DVD as I remember the song from an LP that I have.Having June Carter Cash and the Carter Family on the DVD is a plus. The affection and chemistry between Johnny and June is obvious. One other thing that makes this DVD special for me is that I saw him in concert at about this time (1987) when the record companies weren't too interested in him, but he was still immensely popular with the public. The DVD brings back nice memories.I steered clear of the ""Live at Montreux"" because of reports of poor sound quality. This DVD does not suffer from any lack of audio or visual quality."
3,Good...not great.,I had high hopes for this cd but it was kind of a let down. Is fun to hear but after a while it turns repetitive. Great adition to a dance colection.
3,First disk much better than second,"The mixing was really great on these CDs, but the first disk was definitely much better than the second."
3,Oldies but Goodies,"For diehard fans of Queer as Folk this is a must have, it isn't the season 5 soundtrack but it recaptures the tone set by the season 1 and 2 soundtracks. Having said that if you are in 2 minds about purchasing this set there is nothing new here and like me many will already have all the tracks on other CDs."
5,BOP UNTIL YOU DROP!!!!,"This collection of songs that have played at one time or another on my favorite TV show, ""Queer As Folk"", are presented here and all the songs are mixed with great taste. For anyone wanting all the QAF memorabilia, this is one piece to add to your collection."
4,Very Fine Title,"This very fine title, though not his best, is a good sample of Nelson's skill and diversity, both on saxophone and flute. Best songs are the title song ""Playing For Keeps"", the feeling song ""From one to Another"" and ""Ten Worlds"", this last one with a stunning alto sax solo at 3min 37sec, the best moment of this great title."
5,My gerbils like it!,"My Gerbils have been very happy with this item, and it's great to find something specifically formulated for gerbils (unlike all the Hamster & Gerbil items out there). I find they pick out the best stuff first, so I make sure not to give them any more of the seeds etc until they've eaten everything. I mix this food with Forti Diet Rat & MouseForti Diet ProHealth Food - Mouse or Rat - 3 lb.and this seems to be a good balance for them."
5,Beautiful item!!,"Beautiful bracelet!! Fair pricing and excellent service....I am truly enjoying wearing this lovely bracelet and have received numerous compliments on it, thank you!"
5,"Very Pretty, Perfect for Dress Up or Down",These earrings are very comfortable to wear. They are light weight and I love leverbacks; they are secure and no pinching. When they reflect light the colors are brilliant and eye-catching. I definitely recommend these earrings. The price was perfect and shipping was fast.
2,...,"I love ska music really, but I cannot force myself to like this CD. A couple bright spots, but not enough."
4,This toothpaste does a really nice job. I ...,This toothpaste does a really nice job. I think the mint taste is great. This would be a brand I'd continue to use. Great product!
3,"When I first tried this product, I thought ...","When I first tried this product, I thought that it tasted great. It tasted like a fresh breath of mint gum. But the taste soon wore off, and it started to taste like the polish that a dentist uses. I dislike the pasty taste. I guess that I'm more of a gel-type of person. It was a good performing toothpaste, effective in cleaning my teeth. If you're looking for a good toothpaste, I would recommend it, if you prefer a toothpaste to a gel."
4,When I got this toothpaste I didn't think ...,"When I got this toothpaste I didn't think I'd like it. I've never liked the taste of baking soda toothpaste, but this is not bad. This Colgate has a nice clean, refreshing taste. On top of that, it's whitening, and I like to know that my toothpaste can do so much."
4,A shout-out for traditional country,"This album is classic traditional country music performed by artists that are not ""past their commercial prime"", but performed by artists that country radio abandoned in their quest for the ""stud or babe of the week"" format that pervades country radio these days. I would much rather hear some of these artists than the one-hit-wonders that you hear on the radio. These people still have the chops and it's a pleasure to hear them perform classic Jones songs."
4,Excellent,This is an excellent recording. I would recommend this to ALL who want to develop appreciation for baroque classic music as well as those who already enjoy this genre. Cannabich lived from 1731 to 1798. This says it all.If you like Haydn and CPE Bach symphonies then you will certainly enjoy these. Just let them play and go about the things you need to do and enjoy.The composer's name was new to me but this is the style I enjoy when reading or typing.
2,Not a well made or accurate movie,"If you are an orthodox Catholic or any Catholic for that matter, this is not the right movie for you. First of all, there are many better classical movies about saints out there, such as ""The Reluctant Saint,"" ""Quo Vadis,"" ""Marcelino,"" and several others. This movie is not a good movie in general. The word that comes to mind is flaky. It is very inaccurate, it shows a Saint Francis who was willing to defy the Pope if his rule was not approved (which is completely false for a humble saint such as St. Francis). It shows Christian Crusaders butchering Muslims and Muslims that treat St. Francis with great kindness. It shows St. Francis as a priest, which he wasn't (because of his humility St. Francis refused ordination to the priesthood, remaining a deacon all his life). And this is just some of the blatant errors the movie makes. A poorly made movie not worth owning."
1,People watch this junk?!?!,"Sorry, but this show is just plain trash. It has nothing of value. I can't believe people watch junk like this. This is a great example of why they show nothing but junk on TV today. It's bad enough people watch this, but to fork over their hard-earned cash for it, don't get me started. In this economy, I wish I can afford to throw away money like fans of this show do. Please do yourself a favor, buy a quality show on DVD instead of this trash. Some quality shows include: I Love Lucy, Happy Days, I Dream of Jeannie, The Brady Bunch, The Twilight Zone, etc. Buy those, not trash like The Girls Next Door."
5,the girls next door season 1,"received it fast & was used & even with a few scratches on the last DVD, it played perfectly!!!!!!!!! very satisfied :)"
5,Awesome stuff,This is a hilarious show and it just takes me away from the stresses of life. Makes me feel like I'm living that fun-filled life.
2,"Nice enough music, CONSUMERS SHOULD BE WARNED ABOUT DRM","I like the album enough - KOL have an infectious groove that should put a smile on your face. However, it took me 2 hours to figure out how to get the stuff on my mp3 player - and it's still in secure .wma format (until that gets hacked). IPOD users WILL NOT BE ABLE TO PLAY THIS ALBUM UNTIL SECURE .WMA IS HACKED (which it will be). Amazon has an obligation to inform consumers that CDs like this cannot be burned to .mp3 and that your portable device will be unable to play it unless it supports secure .wma. I have a Creative Zen touch so I'm okay, but others won't be as lucky, as you can see from the reviews of angry customers. SEND A MESSAGE WITH YOUR WALLET - DON'T BUY CDs WITH DRM PROTECTION - I WON'T AGAIN."
4,Solid,"Way better than the debut. I'd almost say it's better as a whole than ""Because of the times"" and ""Only by the night"", although some of the best songs by KOL are on those two later albums. This one rocks!! Solid!"
4,UNFAIR CRITICISM,"Some people on here are berating this disc because of the copy protection. EXCUSE ME, but that has NOTHING to do with the musical content! They are unfairly lowering the star rating for an excellent disc!If you love rock n roll, this is a great set. Don't let those who would put you off from buying this disc confuse you by rating it one star due to copy protection! This is great rock n roll! The best this year - and posers like The Strokes only wish they could be this good! Judge the disc on its musical merits! This is MUSIC - not copy protection! Downloaders and copiers are already ruining the music industry - judge THE BAND by the music, nothing else! The rest is judging the suits of the music industry - not THE BAND and not THE MUSIC! A great disc!"
1,Beware this Filth !!!!,"This is without doubt one of the most unspeakably filthy albums of all time. Their song ""Milk"" is one of the most heinous acts of criminality ever released on to the human race. Satan himself could not have written a filthier tune. Stay clear of this album, and this band, like the plague. When people hear this music coming from your stereo they will desert you.you have been warned."
1,What are people thinking,"I checked out a few songs just to see if they rocked like everyone says and I thought that they pretty much S***. I cant even lump them in with southern rock. With the likes of Molly Hatchet, Lynard, Skynard and even Black Oak Arkansas, who can even compare them to these groups. I wonder how old some of these people are reveiwing these cd's? Because if they think that this is good rock music, then they are not very intellegent.Save your money if you think that this the ultimate rock music, its not. But if you are looking for boring music, then go ahead and buy this pretty lousy CD."
1,Best Album of the Year...worst DRM,"I feel pretty strongly that this album is the best album this year. Seriously. Songwriting, musicianship, production are all far outside what anyone else is doing today in modern music. The sound of this album is completely unequaled when compared to most other current recordings.That being said, the DRM appears to be far worse then everyone here is claiming. There is evidence that Sony is employing rootkit techniques to install hidden files on your PC that cannot be removed. Not being able to easily copy files to an iPod is one thing, installing hidden unremoveable files on your PC is another.Do a google search for ""Sony"" and ""Rootkit"", or check out this site:[...]"
1,Should have read these reviews,"I bought the Kings of Leon album last night. When I got home I was anxious to get it onto my IPOD, however the music files are windows DRM and cannot be copied to the IPOD. What a ripoff!!!! It's so frustrating. I am sure KOL was not aware of these limitations so I don't blame them, just the greedy music label."
4,Copy Protection = No Sale,"I was going to buy this album from Amazon, but the copy protection warning stopped me cold. Got it on itunes instead, and burned a backup.the album's ok. I would guess I'll listen to it for a couple of weeks and then never again. Not exactly a classic."
3,brave new world,"Though it's certainly an acquired taste, (and refreshingly different from any 'body-as-wonderland' trappings - thank you previous reviewer, for that hilarious jab), a band that seems to defy so many stereotypes should have delivered their audience what the audience seems to want: a disc free of this copy protection BS.In this time when record companies are trying to maximize profits, they should be trying to give the consumer more for their money - not less. How about fold-out posters and worthwhile DVDs included? How about discounts on concert tickets? How about a disc that we can freely copy (so that when your defective product scratches, we still have the music we purchased?)Instead, the companies are desperately trying to ""protect"" their interests while ignoring ours. They're a lot like the government!Sad to see such an innovative band not exerting better ""control"" over their product and its satisfaction in the hands and the ears of the consumer."
1,worst cd i ever bought,"they won't let you put zero star. this album is garbage, not one even decent song. the vocal are horrible like a 6 year old boy. save your money, and your ears"
1,Just Awful....,"I saw U2 last night and was made to endure almost 45 minutes of the Kings of Leon. I liked the guitars, but the singer's voice is simply AWFUL!!!!!!! Fortunately, U2 saved the day with a terrific show, but, if you can help it, don't touch the Kings of Leon with a 10 foot pole."
4,Here there be monsters,"Like the Core Book, the creatures detailed are based mainly on the novel as opposed to the film. It provides much-needed expansion on the potential adversaries to throw at your players, and is primarily a GM's tool. There is also some very nice original artowrk, and hopefully Decipher will continue this trend.There is also some very helpful information on how to use magical and special items in your game, with some great examples to help you get the feel of the types of special items that are appropriate to the setting. I wasn't too impressed with the way in which the book suggests that introducing alternative monsters (such as good dragons) can ""destroy"" the integrity of the setting, and it is a little small for the price, but other than that it's a vital buy if you're serious about running a Lord of the Rings campaign."
1,Fine Silver Sampler,"Like her other title, ""Fine Silver Made Fun"", for the price it was very disappointing. Author seems knowledgeable, but she needs to produce a full book (not booklet) and have it professionally edited and published. This ""book"" looks like it was produced quickly for a workshop and not edited."
2,Probably informative.....,"""The Buddhism Primer"" was loaned to me by a friend at work. My expectation, based on the fact he paid $18 for it, was that I would be treated to an informative and professional introduction to Buddhism. Unfortunately, I couldn't make it past the first 10 pages because (IMO) this book read like a working draft of a theology thesis. I found the awkward writing style, the frequent grammar and punctuation errors, and the confusing formatting frustrated any appreciation for the information it contained.If you are not as easily distracted as I am by an unpolished presentation (and I suspect I am in the minority), then it appears by the other reviews that this book is well worth your consideration. If you are, however, I found both ""How to Practice"" by the Dalai Lama and ""Buddhism for Beginners"" by Thubten Chodron to be great introductions."
4,"About time, really.","Well, finally the turtles is coming out, and not just the first 5 (even if it was a whole season).Anyway, I'm glad about it, but you would expect that something as successful as this show, would have some special features. Turtles raked in billions of dollars. It would be nice to see some Eastman and Laird interviews, or a documentary on how real Turtles started selling like mad, and kids were flushing them down the toilet, thinking that they'd like to live in the sewers.There was such a huge impact on a generation with this show, it would just be nice to see some evidence of it again, that's all.(Only 4 stars because there are no features. Otherwise, the episodes are worth 5)"
2,Volume 2 or Season 2?,"We get Volume Two, or better known as `Season Two' for the fans. While we get this set with 13 episodes, though I don't get as to why there are 13 episodes crammed on one DVD disc instead of maybe trying to go with like a 2-Disc set so they weren't trying to cram all them on one disc like this. By doing this there wouldn't be any room left on any of the disc for any special features if they were to decide to put any in this set. While I like having a chance to get these episodes on DVD so I can have them to watch but how the releases at this point were not being done right at least to me they weren't being properly done. Although in this set we get the episodes such as `Shredder Returns', the `Eye of Sarnov' 4 parter, alone with the episode `Splinter No More'. I feel that this release could've been better if they would've taken the time to help make it a more memorable release for the serious fans of the turtles. Overall I give it a 2.5 stars out of 5."
5,Ninja turtles at their best,"Bought this for my ex girlfriend's 3 year old son. He loved the turtles and I was pumped about that since I grow up on those green macines! The quality is perfect, can't go wrong."
1,CHEAP! Don't waste your money!,"I bought this about a month ago and it's already ripped on the side! The material and neoprene is very thin, so don't waste you're money on this one!"
3,It definitely makes you sweat!,"For the price, it's not bad. Could be better quality, but, it does give you extra support while excercising and it DEFINITELY makes you sweat! It says one size fits all, but, I have to admit it was a bit too long. My waist is a size 28 and I had to cut it. I wear it under my clothes and it isn't bulky."
4,Very nice product -it worked for me!!,"Along With 1 hour exercise and this belt, I lost 2 inches in 2 weeks from 35 to almost 33 size and in 1 week I should be ready to wear 33 size Jeans. It is comfortable, it works, I clealy see the burned fat symptoms on my waste/stomach area.I am giving4 star because it is not wide enough to cover your belly, so you have to wear it on the upper part half the time and wear on the lower part half of the time. Hence ordering second belt."
3,Sharon's review,"I can feel the sweat under it when wearing, just not sure its really accomplishing anything else."
1,waist trimmer,"It said it fit most. I did not fit into the category of ""most"". I was unable to use the item since it did not fit me."
1,HORRIBLE BELT!!!,Belt only lasted the second time using it!!!! HORRIBLE MATERIALS!!! Rubber easily tears apart. Velcro can be very itchy. Product gets loose after a couple of minutes putting it on. DID I SAY MATERIALS ARE HORRIBLE? Breaks easy. Horrible product. HORRIBLE MATERIALS.
4,Nice Product and quick delivery,"Smaller than I thought, but i like it...... works well !I wore this product to the gym twice already and it seems to be working well."
1,Author Unworthy to Describe Breed,This was the most useless book I have ever read. The breed is barely discussed. Just some general points for new dog owners in general. The author obviously has no knowledge of the breed. If this wasn't a gift I would have returned it.
3,Placeholder,"My original review was based on the fact that the formatting was broken on the Kindle. It's been fixed since then (whoobah!). I'll update this review once I've made it through the book, but so far so good."
3,"This is a four week program, so I'm ...","This is a four week program, so I'm only half way through it, but so far it seems to be working! It doesn't have a very pleasant taste, and you need to leave it in your mouth for quite a while.... but it leaves your breath fresh and seems to be showing results. So far so good!"
4,Only One Reason to Buy This Single...,"you buy this CD single for one reason only: Sexy MF [remix]. one of the funkiest things you'll ever hear, esp. if you have the system to play it loudly w/o getting arrested. the remixes of ""MNIP"" are pretty blah in my opinion."
5,KIDS TEAM UNIFORM SET,I ordered the football set. It arrived within a week. My son will love it.He loves playing football now he can look like a cowboy player!
2,Lando dosen't get what HE wanted,"The Lando Calrissian Adventures are the worst SW books ever written. Everyone knows that. L.Neil Smith is a bad writer. So,he calls the bad guy the Soceror of Tund,who commands the Imperial Navy. What? ""If your in a bad mood,read THE LANDO Adventures!"""
2,Lando not as good as Han,I read the Prologue and first chapter of Lando Calrissian and the Mindharp of Sharu and that was enough. I prefer The Han Solo Adventures.
4,One of the best,"Having read many of the Star Wars novels I would rate this as one of my very favorites--Or I should say 3 of my favorites as this is a three book set.The story was a fresh one not a rehash of former themes (like many of the tedious Rogue Squadron books).And the author added some nice touches; for instance: throughout this series Lando has a sidekick named Vuffi Raa, Vuffi is a Robot that Lando won in a card game; Lando can't stand him at first; but his relationship with Vuffi is one that teaches us what kind of a person Lando is.This is also a nice, money-saving format for purchasing these series books."
3,A good way to kill time,"While this is by far not one of the best books in the Star Wars series, it most definatly worth reading if your a die hard fan. These three books shed light on Calrissian and give the reader an idea of what is out side the control of the Empire. If you read The Lando Calrissian Adventures make sure that you read The Han Solo Adventures, your sure to like them even more."
3,Show me the Lando,"Back in the day when there was no massive glut of Star Wars books, you had Splinter of the Mind's Eye, the Han Solo triliogy, and this very little known saga of Lando adventures. While Han was popular enough to keep in print, Lando struggled. I found two of these stories in old bookstores but never the third. That's probably the only good thing about this book. I FINALLY got to read the elusive Lando story. Sadly, these books lack something and I still don't know what it is. Like the one reviewer said above, Grade B Han Solo ripoff adventures. Still though, a must for Star Wars fans, and the stories aren't that bad... not really...not quite... well,....maybe."
5,Perfect,"This filter fits my 2009 Scion tC perfectly, and the quality is excellent; it looks exactly like the original part. By the way, as others have said, it's a snap to replace this yourself, and way cheaper than having it done by a mechanic."
2,Typical....Nothing surprising,This is the typical story of a woman running away because her heart was broken by a jerk and she is less than perfect now. She runs a way to a cattle ranch as a cook and the owner who of course is handome falls in love with her and she resists because there's no way he can love her. Sound familiar? Don't waste your time on this one.
3,"""Beauty Queen"" is a serious book about heroin.","""Beauty Queen"" tells you about the truths and horror of a killer drug, heroin. Reading this book showed me how one girl dealt with her addiction and the life as a stripper. It was sad to know how much she relied on heroin, her ""magic potion,"" and not even think she has a problem until her addiction catches up with her. Reading this book will show you how a lot of people don't understand the dangers of heroin, and the serious damage it can do to a person like this."
3,another sad story of drug abuse,"It has been 26 years since the publication of Go Ask Alice and it seems like the storyline of: teenager + drug abuse = death is still worthy of publication. This time the drug of choice is heroin. Many people will not want their children to read books like this, they'll say it will foster the mindset of promotion of drug abuse, but I don't think that is true. I have never taken drugs, and reading about a person taking drugs has never prompted me to indulge. (I have also seen 1000's of acts of violence on Tv and in the movies, and I have yet to committ felonious assault.) If you deciede to read this book, please read Go Ask Alice too. If this book does not scare you, then I'm not sure what would."
2,could have,This book could have been so much better. It seems like the author was too high off her Heroin addiction (read the back of the book) to make this a really good story. Everything was predictable and drab. I feel sorry for Sam but I did not feel for the character or the story as it progressed along.
4,"Trashy, yet fabulous...","I remember reading an exerpt from ""Star: A Novel"" on MSNBC right before it came out and thought, ""...this sounds like a good book - not too deep and meaningful, but not too dumb, either..."". I was right about that. I wasn't expecting too much from ""Star: A Novel""...When I read it, I thought it was a good book. Obviously, it read very much like Pam's life...but it was setup like a novel, as opposed to an autobiography. With the book setup the way it was, it allowed Pam and her co-writer to make it fun to read. There were some parts in the book that were on the trashy side, but it never went too far and left some stuff for the imagination. This was good because it allowed a broad range of readers to read it without it being too smutty.I really enjoyed reading Star and I must say that it surpassed my expectations. It was a fun and light read and Pam did a good job with her first novel. I can't wait for ""Star Struck: A Novel"" to come out in August."
1,Surprisingly bad,"How could such an exciting life make for such a boring book. If you're going to hire a ghost writer, wouldn't you find a good one? I couldn't wait to read this book. Then I couldn't wait to finish it so I could move on to something better. I expected trashy fun, but this was really a disappointment. Mundane, uneven, stupid.... truly a waste of time."
1,The book is as much a bimbo as she is!,"The Hollywood dialogue and the quick changing of people without any recognizable descriptions, made it impossible to get into. Hard to imagine a professional 'ghost writer' having anything to do with this, as it sounded too illiterate. I tried hard, several times to get passed the first chapters, and glimpsed through hoping the grammar would improve, along with the storyline, but it became worse.............. I think she pretends not to know much, so that the little girl act supposedly makes men feel protective of her. No adult can be so simple, without being simple. Everyone says it is really her autobiography, but who knows? I do not believe anyone can have such a lack of morals, as this main character............I shall never buy anything Ms Anderson has written again. Boring, hard to understand, all over the place, no decent storyline, uninteresting characters who are impossible to care about, etc etc.,Donni-Jay (author)"
1,Worst book I have ever read,"I thought this would be alot more interesting that it was. I was upset I had spent the time that I had on the book, and don't bother looking for a good ending it kind of drifted off into la-la land somewhere, and that's where it ended. I would not recommend this book to anyone."
5,Behold the power of Cheese (I love cheese),"This is a cheesy, steamy, FUN novel. It was just what I needed this weekend.Star is obviously autobiographical in parts. (As she gets comfortable with her newfound fame, for example, she contacts an animal rights group to see how her fame can help them.) It's written light, and funny. Reading this book made me admire Ms. Anderson more, because she is obviously not a bit of prettu fluff, but a clever, multi-faceted woman.I highly recommend STAR. I gave a copy as a gift, and would do so again."
1,juvenile & shallow,"i was excited to read this book. I would only advise fans of Pam to NOT read this ""Judy Blumeseque"" psuedobiography. I expected a bit more. Try Jenna Jameson's book instead."
2,"Uninspiring, Unentertaining...like a porno with more plot","I thought this would be a fun and interesting book to read and would be entertaining, but it was just a drag. There were a couple of interesting moments and some spicy sex, but between those few moments, I just felt that the book dragged on. There seemed to be big holes in the story that left me unsatisfied, and the ending really sucked. I only liked guessing who the celebrities were that she changed the names of - Like Tommie Toms is actually Marky Mark, and Salty Keller is actually Kelly Slater! That is why I gave it 2 stars. But this book is really cheesy and I liked Pam more BEFORE I read the book. This makes her seem like a bigger TRAMP than I thought she was. Don't waste your money. Plus there were so many grammatical and punctuation errors, It gave me the impression that it was never proofread!!"
4,Pleasantly Surprised,"I just arrived home from a book signing for Pamela Anderson's book, STAR, and I have to say I was pleasantly surprised not only by the book itself, but by the lady who wrote it. I didn't dive very far into the book, but from what I have read, it's not going to be long until I finish it. It's one of those ""just can't put it down"" novels.I found the author (who signed my copy of STAR)to be more beautiful in person, and seemed sweet. I'm glad that not only did I get this book, but that I was able to get it signed by the lovely Pam Anderson."
1,Sweet Valley High Meets Softcore Porn,"Was this book written for adults or 13 year olds? If it wasn't for Pamela...I mean Star, having sex with 9 out of 10 people that she ran into, the reading level is 8th grade at most. Horrible."
5,a correction,"One of the previous commentors on this song gave Robert Fripp the credit for the fine guitar work on Ali Click, but it was actually Jamie West-Oram of The Fixx. Robert Fripp does play on the Nerve Net album but not on the song Ali Click."
4,My husband and I really liked this toothpaste. ...,"My husband and I really liked this toothpaste. It tastes much better than other whitening toothpastes that we've tried. It also left our mouths feeling fresh and clean much longer than our old toothpaste did. I don't know if it did much to whiten our teeth, and if it did, the difference was only subtle. Overall, I think we like it enough to switch from the toothpaste we've been using for the past five years."
4,Nice one Omar,"An enjoyable listen. If you like some 80's pop/soul/funk with a bit of jazz thrown in you may like this first album from a very successfull (especially in the 80's) session drummer. He displays his other talents here too such as singing and guitar but keeps it all within himself and doesnt go too overboard with it like he does a bit in his second album 'the groovesmith'. My faves are track 5, the title track, 11(amazing 16bar drum break!-simple but effective) and the last track for a technically very, typically omar, good drum outro."
2,disappointing and shallow,"The two best essays in this book had been previously published (perhaps in Oprah's magazine?). Most of the rest were shallow, not long-term friendships, and one even sounded like her hook-up of the month. Don't bother."
5,A Must Read,"I loved this book and frequently recommend it to people.Men or women can benefit because it will help you cope if you are currently dealing with a friendship loss. Even if you aren't, it's a good read & may prevent you from ever hurting someone unintentionally.I highly recommend this book - 5 stars aren't enough. If you like it, you'll also like ""What Did I Do Wrong?: When Women Don't Tell Each Other the Friendship is Over"" by Liz Pryor.God Bless"
1,not so good,"the only thing i liked about this book was the introduction.i am a white, professional, upper middle class female, 40 years old. there wasn't any story that i could relate to. most of the women went to ivy league schools, or at least seemed very upper class and snobby. i can't imagine many people really relating if i couldn't. also a story about a woman who had sex with her best friends boyfriend and struggles with the idea that that friendship ended...hmmmm, what a surprise! i can't think of anything more ridiculous and boring to read about. get real. that's what i say about the whole book!"
5,Great,Purchased an old one at a yard sale. Liked it so much I wanted one with all the parts. Use it for picking up sweet gum balls.
4,agile,"I have several pecan trees. I've had one of these perhaps fifteen years. After five years, one of the wires broke from fatigue. The only nut picker I saw for sale locally was the H&K.; I found it cumbersome. I fixed my Griffith picker with a piece of springy wire.Eventually, I came to favor the H&K; because husks are less likely to cause trouble. Otherwise, the Griffith seems quicker and less demanding."
2,Not the Original Recordings,"These are not the original hits by the original artists, but rather remakes by the original artists or a member of the original group. Anyone who actually lived through those years would know this. Some of these rerecordings aren't too bad, some not so good, but they are clearly NOT the original hits."
3,Disappointed for the most part.,"Some of the songs in this CD are wonderful, but there are enough mediocre songs on it that I chose not to play it at my husband's 74th birthday party."
3,Doesn't fit,The firefighter ducky spout guard doesn't fit because of the Diverter on the spout. It's still cute and my son likes to play with it. We are hoping that when we move out it'll fit on the bath faucet at the new place.
2,"Prevents baby head bumps, but a pain in the neck for mom!","This product kept my daughter from injuring herself on the facet (many times, actually, otherwise I'd give it one star), but that is all. The bubble bath dispensing feature doesn't work unless you are filling the tub all the way up because the bubble bath comes out way too slow. I never fill the tub all the way up with my 18 month old. I would think by the time your kid is old enough to be safe in a full tub of water, you probably don't need a spout cover anymore!The most annoying thing about this cover is the fact that I almost have to pull the spout out of the wall to get the thing off! There is no way to get to the shower diverter on top of the spout without taking the cover off, so this is truly frustrating. I'm thinking of trying theSkip Hop Moby Bath Spout Cover - Sky Blueas it seems like it would do much better with the diverter issue."
3,So very ordinary.,"It's okay, not all that great. Some good tunes, but the rest is boring and ""so very ordinary"". I like their songs on their split cds better(Diesel Boy, Lonely Kings, Everyday Victory). I'd recommend all the split cds over this album. Divit is your average punk/pop band, but they're better then all the Yellowcard, Rufio, and NFG bands. Pretty good, but nothing revoulational is what I can say about this band. For fans of No Use for a Name, Lagwagon, and other pop/punk bands."
4,Overall a cute costume,"Overall as described. Fits well, had to pin the fuzzy leg warmers up to avoid them from slipping down. Very cute costume, I would recommend it."
5,Pretty Good!,"The season was good (I'd seen all the episodes before, so I knew what I was buying)...The it arrived on time, the packaging undamaged. I looked over it before I opened the DVD's plastic wrap and seal, and I was happy with the condition it arrived in. Sometimes, when they're new, they still arrive intact but damaged. Not so with this. If you liked this season, I definitely recommend buying from here."
1,"Loved the DVD! However, problem with DVD Amazon sent","The DVD was great and enjoying to watch. However, one DVD wouldn' work and kept stopping and couldn't watch it at all. Tried to clean it but it still won't run right to watch. Too expensive to ship it back to Amazon and didn't want to wait long to get another one. First time ever with trouble with DVD's ordered from Amazon."
2,"Remington Steele, seasons 1, 4 & 5","The format for selecting an episode is horrible. You can't play all episodes, you must select one episode and only one. When the episode is over then you must go back to menu and fight to find another one. There is no description for each episode either. Foxhome video did a lousy job of formatting these dvds."
3,Love the completeness but disappointed in sound quality.,"It's great to have all the CCR studio albums, and some of the more obscure stuff all in one package.However, I already owned all the CCR studio albums, except Mardi Gras, on CD and was disappointed to find that these ""remastered"" CDs didn't sound any better than the individual CDs that I bought many years ago (and since gave to a friend). (And, I was listening on a system that is beyond anything you'll find at these consumer electronic superstores. I can hear it whan remastering is done correctly.)"
4,SIMPLEMENTE LOS MEJORES,"Excelente recopilación de una de las mejores agrupaciones del rock-folk norteamericano, tengo una gran adquisición con este producto, lo recomiendo 100%"
5,Choices in life.,This is a great story of how choices you make in life affect you and others. Dylan preferred to stay out with his friends drinking instead of coming home. His new wife couldn't take it anymore and left to go back home. She was pregnant and there was a car accident in the winter weather that caused her to lose the baby. This story shows how Dylan managed to clean up and start a new life and then he accidentally gets thrown back into Lorraine's path and even though she tries not to she can't help but find herself thinking of him.
5,A true inspiration,"A story about failure, second chances and God's grace. A story about faith and how God can turn mistakes into lessons."
5,This non-techno-geek loves it!,"Okay, this is for all you out there who don't know a RAM from a rap song, and who think CPU stands for Central Pennsylvania University. This is a nice laptop - a bit bigger than some and heavy to tote around, but that isn't what I use it for. In fact, it replaced my hulking, cord-ridden, space-gobbling desktop. I use my computer mostly for the convenience and fun of the internet, along with plenty of e-mailing. It has a nice, easy-to-use finger pad, and well-defined keys; I have found that the keyboard is over-sensitive, however. I've heard there is ""someplace"" you can go to correct this, but it doesn't bother me enough to go there. Wherever it is. The screen is crystal-clear with excellent color. I play CDs on it while I'm surfing the internet, and the sound quality is good. A bit heavy to carry around everywhere (which I don't anyway), but when I go on vacation it's fine to put in the car and simply plug in wherever I'm staying. I love my ""desk-top laptop""."
2,Shouldn't have changed the name...,"As the name change implies, this album represents a new beginning for the band formerly known as Nic Armstrong & the Thieves. Their sound is no longer as '60s-centric, and the vocal and writing duties are shared by all band members. Unfortunately, the results just aren't very good. The album opens promisingly with the blistering ""You Can't Love What You Don't Understand,"" but it quickly goes downhill from there; very few of these tunes display even a fraction of the charm and catchiness of the songs on ""The Greatest White Liar."""
5,Wonderful story,"My kids are huge Thomas fans and my 4-year-old son became a big fan of Hiro from the Thomas website. So as a surprise one day, I purchased this movie. The kids enjoyed it very much and it was full of good messages and themes. A nice, wholesome movie for small children!"
5,Thomas never fails to excite my 3 year old,This is the newest Thomas & Friends movie and it's a BIG hit...We've watched it over and over and over again.
4,Good book for introductory level.,"Excellent book for introductory level, however this is my first book in Physics solid state. The firsts chapters are very concise , perhaps I'm gonna have to get another for complementing in advanced level."
