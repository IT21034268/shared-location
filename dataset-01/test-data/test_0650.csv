2,definitely not reliable,"I used this light for months, thrilled with it. I didn't have any battery problem, because I used the adaptor. The design was fine, the light was bright... BUT, just as another viewer said, the connection switch needs major improvement, as suddenly it would no longer turn on. I replaced the bulb, but that turned out to not be the problem. I would have rather had a regular on-off switch that might last, than the automatic switch with extension/retraction that so quickly malfunctions."
2,Poor Design,There is no off or on switch for this light. You have to manually unplug it from the power source to turn off. Not what I wanted in a reading light I use when I am in my bed in the evening.
5,Great light!,"I've had the volume 2 for 3 years, I read every night before going to sleep. I LOVE it. It recently broke due to the wiring issues others have posted, and I seemed to have had to replace the bulb about once a year. Not unreasonable in my opinion for the steady use I put it thtough. I'm definatly going to buy a replacement."
4,The best book light.,"I have no electrical outlet near my bed so I've been through half a dozen book lights, as they are the only way I can read in bed. This one is the best. The others came apart, stopped working, or tore through batteries so fast that they were impractical. I use rechargeable batteries in this one and I've been using it for a couple of years without needing to replace it. The only drawback is that it's a little too heavy to carry in a purse, but for home or travel use this one is the best."
4,I own two.,"I own two that include the ac adapter. They are great bright lights. I used the first one so much that it sometimes slides closed too easily. Replacement bulbs are not hard to find. Don't bother paying for high priced Zelco bulbs. I bought my generic replacements at Walmart in the area they sell flashlights.I use rechargeable batteries. They probably last 8-10 hours on a fresh charge, maybe longer. I've had to use one as a substitute dome light when in a vehicle for an extended period. I put it on the visor.The lights are very bright. In some circumstances they might be too bright, but that would be a weird complaint for a light, huh?"
1,Broke right away,"It would have been nice to use this, but it broke before my husband even got a chance to try it out. The light just didn't come on after few openings more than occasional flashes, then that ended too. It has a contact problem. Hubby said he'll try to fix it, but now a year later, it is still in a box waiting to be fixed...couldn't return, we tossed the original packaging, now it's too late anyway. We'll buy a new one at some point."
2,"Old, old, old -- not for modern devices",The ovens covered in the book have been out of date for a long time. Definitely not about modern turbo cookers.
3,hugh grant collection???,Very little of the collection was actually Hugh Grant. The title of the collection was misleading to me. I guess I should have paid more attention to the descriptions of each movie.
5,Professional Trainer,As a professional police dog trainer this book is the only dog training book that I have read that addresses the heart of in my field training. Late in life I decided to learn about the science behind training and now a student of behavior science. This book should be a must read for every trainer. Information here goes directly to applied behavior modification something every trainer should have at very least a working understanding of.
5,How Dogs Learn,"I have trained many dogs using only one method. This book showed me all dogs are different. If you carefully watch your dog you will discover what kind of rewards will work for him using operant conditioning. I finally understood the methods some trainers use such as the clicker which previously to reading this book drove me nuts! Also, the history of dog training with short biography on the persons who developed dog training from the beginning. Scientific evidence for types of training and different methods of operant conditioning. What makes a good dog trainer read this book and find out. Excellent book. Book from Amazon.com"
2,Not suitable for doors less than near maximum width,"The product says that it will fit doors ranging ""from 1 3/4 in to 2 1/4 in"". That is incorrect; more like 2 or 2 1/8 as the lower value. It will fit doors well enough that are near maximum width. On doors less than the near maximum width, it will rattle, hang awkwardly, not be usable as a coat hook and prevent the door from closing. Check to see if your door is within in 1/8 of an inch to the 2 1/4 inch width of the product and you should (hopefully) be fine."
1,Worse than Ramen Noodles at 10 times the price!,"This product is not worth 20 cents! Extremely salty, dry, simply junk in a box! Noodles are dry like eating cheap ramen which is so healthy, not!"
3,A great magazine article,"This book seems to me just an expansion of his issue-length Wired magazine cover story, which is available for free on-line. The article was terrific, but I'd save my money and get it for free."
1,DVD IS DEFECTIVE!!!!,"I was thrilled to see that this was FINALLY on DVD. I purchased it and halfway through the movie, the DVD stopped working and skipped. I figured it was the DVD so I bought another one - same thing is happening. Apparently whoever ""remastered"" this was drunk or fell asleep on the job. DON'T BUY THIS until the glitch is fixed!!!!!"
2,The Dust Pan Is Great!,"I threw out the broom the first day,it really sucked, but the dust pan is handy for my regular broom. I kinda wanted a connecting set, however."
4,Cheaper than the Nikon battery works just as well,I have two of these for my D80. They're cheaper than the Nikon battery and they seem to work just as well.
3,RECEIVED HARD AS A BRICK!!!,"WHAT!!! SAYS COCONUT OIL, OIL NOT SOLID. WELL THEY SHOULD TELL YOU UP FRONT THAT IT FREEZES AT 75 DEGREES. AND TO LIQUEFY IT NEED TO SOAK BOTTLE IN HOT WATER FOR A BIT, THEN TURNS TO OIL FORM. STORED IN MY CABINET IT TURNS SOLID AGAIN. WOULD BE NICE THEY STATE THIS FACT UP FRONT."
4,"It's coconut oil, pure and simple","This is produced and packed in India, where the oil is liquid at 'room' temperature because the room tends to be really hot. When it is shipped to our more temperature clime, it solidifies and makes a joke of its container.I set it in a dishpan of hot water until it reliquifies and then pour it into a mayonnaise jar or small plastic container from whence I scoop it as needed. My flatmate pours it into a Ziploc bag and lays it flat on a tray in the fridge to solidify, then breaks off what's needed.Trader Joe's has organic coconut oil already in 16 oz wide mouth jars for $5.99.I give Parachute 4 stars instead of 5 because they really could pack it in wide mouth containers for export."
3,"Excellent, but frustrating","Excellent quality, little or no imparted flavor, and in general exactly what's wanted. Price is right. Frustrating to use. I will continue to purchase, and continue to complain.The product is produced in India, where ambient temperatures maintain the oil in constant liquid state. In more northerly climes, such as my own in (U.S.) WA state, the oil is always congealed to semisolid condition, making the silly little container cap useless. ""Thawing"" of a quart container is clumsy, yet managing a handful of smaller containers is an unnecessary circus of busywork. For export to cooler destinations, the product should be packaged in a wide-mouth container permissive of product extraction via spoon or spatula."
1,not worth buying,if you want to watch a couple of kids haming it up go ahead and get this. this is basically the same as the 2 safari 3ds with hunter ellis. same words-same scenes. put out by wild eyes productions. i think they made one movie and then copied it in two other ones so you would think they had made 3 different safari 3ds. i got this because i like the snimal 3ds but very disappointed by this. the kids get on my nerves as they talk so long. i gave this a star but it isn't even worth that. its just my opinion.
5,Mrs. Hobbs is a hit!,"If you enjoyed The Ghost of Fossil Glen, you won't be disappointed by this one! It's the cat's pajamas!"
3,Average,They're okay if you wanna try them out but after that I wouldn't wanna buy again. They're kinda of hard as well so the 5 pound bag lasted for quite some time.
2,Save your money....,"The only great thing about this movie, is to my opinion, the very beautiful African countryside....Very striking and cruel at the same time.....The story itself, was not worth the price of the dvd....."
4,desert drama,"If you like ""desert movies"" this is one of the good ones. (Are there any bad ones?) To qualify as one of the ""good ones"" the movies must have the requisite trek across the sands under the sun at its most intense focus; cracking dry lips, blistering skin, the dune tumble down, and, finally the rescue. The dramatics/melodramatics between the characters is incidental because, at the very core, the real drama is the 'man versus his environment' motif. ""Sands of the Kalahari"" delivers this crucial scene! I downed half a pitcher of lemonade during the ...trek! The movie cast actors that can deliver the goods convincingly, but I am baffled by who in the world hired Stuart Whitman? His contribution is as a black hole that sucks up all the energy in every scene he's in. Other than the one cast miscue this movie satisfies; it's worth the price of admission and the time investment to sit with a box of popcorn. I rate this movie as four boxes of popcorn!!"
2,"Poor design, didn't work.","Upon opening the box I noticed a part that was already broken. It was part of the handle and didn't effect the performance, but on top of that the pop up pressure gasket didn't work. It would work if you stood there and watched it and tapped it, but what's the point. I had reservations when I bought, but the price was so good, I should have stuck with my gut. Fortunately Amazon Warehouse Deals was excellent about the return and customer service."
4,Good movie to complete the story (hopefully),"Saw this movie on opening night, I was very excited but also ready to be a little disappointed, luckily I wasn't. This movie really gave a better insight about why a demon has been following the family around for the past twenty years. I also understood the characteristics of Toby a little better than most (obviously) because I have an idea of how demons behave. Prey on the children and manipulating them while at the same time wreaking havoc, which really made the movie flow better, since it had a hold of Katie from the get go, but more violently than voluntarily with her sister. Overall, four stars since I did go WTF a few times during the movie and jump a couple of times (more because I'm sensitive to sudden loud noises than anything, but I'll give the movie the benefit of the doubt :] )"
2,A bad old blast from the past,"What do you get when innovative people chase a buck? Well, this movie is the answer to Here is the last of the series, and we can all thank the sprits for that because it was by far the worst. This one attempts to set up the events that unfolded din the earlier movies, and follows the same formula to get there as well. So, what you have is the same movie (basically), but with the bonus of seeing some 80s fashion. Not my idea of a great movie. So, you can imagine that I was very underwhelmed."
1,sucks ass!,"last 15 minutes will mess me up for life? yeah right. dumbest one in all the installments if you ask me. the amityville hauntings was way scarier than this crap! i didnt buy into the whole ""toby"" crap. two thumbs down in my horror movie book."
1,I want my three dollars back,"This movie was a complete waste of time. I think it may have been sexist, too actually. It did not seem to represent the 80's very well. There was no John Cusack, and there were certainly no songs by music legends Earth, Wind and Fire. This movie is a jive turkey"
3,Paranormal Activity 3,"Though I have mixed feeling about this film, I can't say I wasn't warned by watching the first two films. The film settles into the same tone as the first two releases and creates the same sort of atmosphere. You can expect the same results from this movie as the others, speaking of an increase in activity near the end of the film. I have to admit there were some good ""make you jump"" segments which I did just that.I did watch this film in the theater, which I feel takes some of the scary feeling away with other people sitting a few rows away. I recommend watching it, at home, alone, in the dark for a better atmosphere and then, it could be possible that you will be looking in all the dark areas of the house before going to bed. That's to say you can.Another watch once scary film."
1,Does NOT work.,I am extremely disappointed..... The Blue Ray I ordered doesn't work. It constantly freezes at certain parts of the movie which is very frustrating. Boo!!!!!
1,A huge disappointment,I wish there was negative reviews for this work. The first problem was the previews. The previews were awesome and actually told most of the story. When I got to the film however nothing from the previews was in the movie. The 1st and 2nd movies rocked and are worth the price however the quality ends there. Don't waste your money on this one and I never saw the fourth one.Ultimately if you can't make your movies match your previews then something is seriously wrong with your work.
4,Slow load time but decent movie,I do like the convenience of being able to simply push a button or two then watch a movie but the download times from amazon are terrible.
3,Not so scary.,"This is a step-back in time and is filmed Blair-Witch Project like. The audience waits for the monster under the bed or in the closet as it may be to jum p out any minute, but it is more like Ghost Hunters on the Syfy channel. The suspense does build until the twist at the end which makes the movie worth watching. It is a Friday night with popcorn kind of film."
3,All right but this will get old soon...,Ive seen parnanormal 1 not 2 cuz i heard 2 sucked 3 was probabale the best of them how ever i feel like this franchiese is getting boring mabye for suspense and paranormal stuff fans this is awesome but for the average horror fan it may leave u disapointed. I was not really disapointed beacause honestly I've never had that much love for Paranormal Activity the script is alright and the plot is acuataly better than the first one but sooner or later Paranormal fans will even get bored.
3,"See 1, watch 2 for posterity, skip 3","1 was most definitely my favorite in the series -- 2 explains some stuff that was missed in one allowing it to further explain the storyline. 3 ... well... 3 explains 1 detail delivers 1 or 2 moments where it will scare the crap out of you, but honestly doesnt deliver anywhere near what 1 did or the filler information 2 did..."
1,Horrible,This movie was a huge disappointment! I have watched the first two and looked forward to seeing the third and I was highly disappointed! The movie was finished before you could get into watching it!
4,Paranormal Activity 3 (Blu-ray/DVD Combo in Blu-ray Packaging),"these paranormal movies are really good, in my opinion, while most people hate themwhich i dont know why, to me i enjoy watching them, this 3rd one i did not enjoy asmuch as the other 2 but they are still very entertaining, this version comes withthe blu-ray + dvd + digital copy, the picture quality on it, was ok, because mostof the film takes place at night, if you love horror , you will love this"
4,AWESOME!,"The photography on the cover of this record is genius, and totally makes this album worth picking up."
2,just ok,"Thought a review other than an editor/publisher or novel pumper was in order.This novel gets lost in the sub text and humanistic day to day trivialities of the mundane lives that surround.I want to get lost in intrigue and defiled upon the senses NOT living out a fantasy based on someone you might meet on the street whom could have been dropped into this book. Dialogue about sandwiches, bagles and a possessive girlfriend is rhetoric I can get at the coffee shop. If there is a clandestine Federal agency involved infuse it into the story. I don't want to read about singed cats and frikin tuna fish."
1,Aren't there laws against false advertising?,"Anybody that wants to learn how to make lethal weapons out of VERY limited materials would be better off reading a book about ""zip guns"" or watching an A&E; special about California prisons. For instance, the section on ""blades"" shows pictures of confiscated ""shanks"", talks about REALLY boring and/or commonly known things (shanks can be designed to stab or to slice!), and says how ""razor blades, metal dining insturments, or even bedsprings can be made into lethal weapons""!! Yeah... but HOW?This book is solely recommended for people who have never seen a movie (or read a book, or seen a documentary) with prisons, prisoners, or ex-cons in it. It is NOT for people who want to be like Micheal from ""Prison Break"", (who can make acids, bombs, poisons or noxious gas from cleaning products), not even for people who are going to jail and would like to know the absolute rudimentary basics about ""Prison Killing Techniques"".-ak"
1,"Very, very cheap quality","Sure this thing is only around $20, but this thing was built horribly. I had to snap the buttons back into the metal face plate as they were coming out from the factory. After a few times of switching button #1, it failed and wouldn't turn off. Another button stayed partially illuminated even when off. This is junk, stay away."
2,Scottish Ghost Stories,being scottish I did not find this book very interesting. I actually found it boring and unreadable so bad didn't finish
5,A review for this edition,"The other review on this page mistakenly refers to this edition as the novel by T. H. White. Its not. This edition is a short adapation for young children of how King Arthur became king. Maccrone's Arthur is a young boy, and he is ""tricked"" by Merlin into freeing the sword from the stone. Boddy's illustrations are great."
3,Dragon Wing Review,"The Good: This item really does the job blocking the wind when you want it to. In fact it blocks so much wind that my rich running bike with a 10"" windshield left me breathing fumes under 50 mph. That is easily remedied by opening the Dragon Wings and allowing some air to pass thru. They do make the ride more comfortable.The Bad: The shields I bought fit my 02 Electraglide with the 3 screws. The shields vibrated so bad,under 50 mph, that they both broke at two of the screw holes in the plastic. I even tried putting 3M tape behind them to steady them to the fairing. That didn't work.I did not overtighten the screws either. I used thread lock and barely tightened them to the fairing.Amazon let me return them and receive a full refund from the seller.Amazon is the best!"
4,Good for fussy birds,"I buy this stuff all the time for my mealy amazon parrot. I know this size is made for cockatiels, but my parrot prefers the smaller size and makes less of a mess when he eats it. Also, all the pieces look and taste exactly the same, so he doesn't pick out the orange ones like he would do with the fruit blend variety. There are fancier, more expensive bird foods out there, but after 25 years of owning parrots, I can attest that this is the best bang for your buck. I only deducted a star because the food smelled a little stale when I opened it. Next time, I'll buy from a vendor that moves through their inventory a little quicker."
1,What an imagination.,"Having read many books on this subject, I am sure Florinda Donner has never been among the Yanomamo and this work of fiction is merely wishful thinking. For an accurate portrait of a Yanomamo woman's life I recommend ""Yanoaama: the story of a woman abducted by Brazilian Indians"" by Helena Valaro."
5,Great workout!,I ordered this for my sister because she had one and it was temporarily misplaced. It is one of her favorite workouts.
3,terrible production,"Oh god that's one miserable way to produce your record. The sound is too fuzzy, too murky. And the vocals are just too cheezy, and forced. The lyrics are annoying, too. Some of the parts of the album are really cool though, like when they just go to a jazz sound out of nowhere on 'Observer...'. Basically the arrangements to the songs are generally really, really innovative and interesting, especially on Cryptosporidium, Hybrid, 99' of Smoke (this one is just crazy, but it is great) and Exploiting Dysfunction. They really have a whacked out atmosphere, which is an achievement by the band. Again, they are let down majorly by poor production and a very poor effort on vocals, imo. Also, there's a few filler songs which have weaknesses like Gracias and the song about police brutality (cant remember name)Get this if you're really bored or if you're a stoner."
3,Had a real hard time with this one,"I don't mind music challenging me, but this one just never paid off. There's some great songs here such as ""Penelope"" and ""Day Dareaming of You"" and even ""The Event's Leading...""This album is a collection of oddities that piece together. I don't know what they're supposed to form once whole. There was also a lack of ""tightness"" within the songs. I just had a hard time with it. I have everything else Of Montreal has done so far, and I love each albums (even the Early 4-Track Collection).If you're debating between this and another Of Montreal album, I'd recommend you skip this one unless you're very adventurous."
4,pinzon 8 piece stainless steel- pretty good,This is good value for the money. The only criticism I can say so far is that the canister is of medium to light weight so it can fall over easier than I would like but overall I can't complain. I would purchase this set again.
5,Excellent Album,"Roger does a great performance and this is a good album by all means. ALways liked Roger and his interpretation of songs. A good song writer in his own right. I'd like to see a ""true"" collection of Roger Whitaker songs, say at least a 100 songs in one package. This would make a great collectors edition."
2,Very short life,"Buy them by the dozen because, on AC power, these bulbs have a very short effective lifespan.The heat generated causes the glass to start darkening from the first use. In a matter of weeks you'll notice that you can't see the type very well anymore. This is because the bulb glass turns dark grey, so very little light can pass through it."
5,Helpful for those late night reads...,"I like the Itty Bitty Book Light and the bulbs because I can then read long into the night without disturbing my husband after we have turned in for the night. The replacement bulbs are a tad on the expensive side, but so well worth it to be able to continue using the book light. I do wish the bulbs lasted a bit longer and it would be nice if they did not get dim because of turning a darkish blue color after they are on for a while. Having a bright light is better for your eyes, and one can direct the book light so it shines directly on the book so that the light does not bother anyone else's sleep."
5,Great mystery for people who love dogs & love to laugh,"I've owned dogs all my life and can relate to Whiskey Mattimoe's frustrations with her inherited Afghan hound Abra. Some dogs are good, and some are--well--almost untrainable. Guess which category Abra belongs in? Therein lies a lot of the humor in this exciting mystery. Intriguing characters add to the fun. Wright can really write snappy dialogue. You can hear these characters talking!"
2,Quality is not very focused on this anymore... maybe b/c dot matrix is becoming obsolete,"When you first install the product, it starts off printing very sharp and clear, no complaints. But in no time, like in 3-4 months or so, if not less, the guide that's inserted into the print head cracks before the ribbon even runs out, or is that supposed to be your indicator that the ribbon has in fact ran out... I don't know. And of course, once it cracks, it's pretty much useless as the ribbon will get all folded up, wrinkled, and creased, there's no fixing it. So I've pretty much had to toss it and replace it again and again."
4,More great Chenilles,"The Chenilles' latest will not disappoint their fans. The songs have enough in common with their earlier efforts to remind you what you love about them, but they're different enough to justify there being a new disc.On first hearing, I liked this album a little less than some of their others, but after a while I find I like it more. As always, the harmonies are delightful. They combine a jazzy 50s sound and texture with modern subject matter.The lyrics are not great poetry, but they're thoughful. If ""About Happiness"" doesn't make you cry a little you've lived a life very different from mine. At bottom, I think, that's what I like about the Chenilles--their songs are not about the trite excesses of the youth culture, instead they remind you of feelings worth feeling. They manage to be both tuneful and thoughtful."
4,One of my Favorites,"This item is hard to find in bricks & mortar stores, so happy to find it on-line. Had seen them in person so this was a nice find."
1,macrobiotic diet,"Less meat, more beans. Dietary suggestions are contrary to scientifically known benefits. Such as people from N. America should not eat fruit, avocados or olive oil. Puhlease."
5,Great Mother's Helper!,"This seat works WONDERFULLY!!! I hate the idea of my baby chewing on the bars of shopping carts, and he is way to young to have the concept of ""no"". This covers the bar, so I know that at least what he is chewing on is clean. It also has the strap and padded seat to keep him securely up right and comfortable. It is a little bulky to carry around with you, but if you are going from car to cart (or right into a restaurant for use in a high chair) it works wonderfully. It is worth buying and keeping in your car at all times!"
2,Not as happy as I thought I'd be,"I bought this seat because my 5 month old loves to look around, and is growing tired of her infant seat. I thought it would be perfect since there are so many shopping carts with broken straps. I loved the fact that it kept the handle covered for her, but the seat kept moving when she was sitting on it, causing her to slide all over the place. I am going to return it to the store. Very disappointed"
2,Disappointed,"This is o.k. if you're using it as a restraint only. If you want it to protect your child from the germs on the cart, forget it. I thought the bar cover would keep my baby from touching and chewing on the bars, wrong. It hardly covers anything. I went back and bought the cart cover that covers everything, I wish I would have spent the extra money before wasting it on this seat."
1,Air travel a no-go,"If you plan to use this with a wiley infant as a lap-child instead of purchasing an airline seat, have a back-up plan. In the event you get flight attendants (like I got) who enforce the rules, they will not let you use this to secure your child either on your lap or in an available seat. Bottom line, you may end up on a long flight with no restraint at all for your child."
3,Watch out for outrageous shipping and handling charges!!,"The shoes are exactly what I wanted, and at a great price, but it is inappropriate for Amazon and Jos. A Banks to list them at a 27% discount when most of that discount disappears with what has to be the highest shipping and handling rates for shoes sold by Amazon. The shipping was $13.95 plus a $4 ""handling"" charge for shoes (most of the other Amazon shoe sellers have free shipping)! Also note Jos. A Banks charges an ""estimated"" sales tax where most of the other Amazon shoe vendors do not. My $119.99 shoes ended up with almost $30 in add-ons for a total of $149.32 (for an actual 9.5% discount). I still got a decent deal, but it was a complete letdown to get dinged so bad by Jos. A Banks fine print!!"
3,Looks Good - Feels bad,Wear these shoes everyday since I got them. After a week the leather is still very stiff around my ankle causing blisters. If they break in I will come back and change my review to a 4 star. They are also a little pricey. They are a nice looking shoe but I also have a pair of Bostonian Akron's and as far as I can tell they are just as nice as the Melton for half the price. Save your money buy Bostonian.
4,All I expected,"True to size fit. Made in India. Better value than similar shoe in same price range from Cole Hann. Easy to ""break in"" just wearing around the house in an afternoon ."
3,Stiff,"The transaction was very smooth. Quick shipping. Shoes were as described. Very stylish. Very stiff out of the box. I thought they would be a little more comfortable initially for the price. I have worn them several times, and they are still very stiff. This has caused the tip of the sole to wear prematurely as the sole does not flex well. I would try a different brand next time."
1,...........................................,"this is the most ""WORST GAME EVER"" its just so dumb has no point. yea maybe puzzle lovers will like it but i dont recomend it 4 action wanter, fps lover, puzzle hater, rpg needer, people!________________________________________________________________Soon nerds will rule the worldAnd so will my cats"
4,"Light, down-tempo electronica","Great mellow electronica. If anyone else has been searching in vain for info on the music layered behind the recent (March 2002) Orange (UK) advertisement, this is the album. The track is number 2, ""Bakerloo."""
4,Gibson Polish,"The product arrived safe, and a week earlier than stated (which is great).It's the second time have used this product and I feel confident that in 20 years time my prized Gibson will not turn white as with normal guitar polishes."
4,The series winds down,"Excellent story lines. But this season spells the beginning of the end for That 70s Show, which ended after season 8."
1,Completely Wrong/Incorrect Cover Art,The Cover Art For Season 7 is 100% Wrong becuase in the 1st episode this season Donna goes blonde and yet she is still a redhead on the cover.Fox should change this.
5,You can't beat the features for the price!!!,"PROS:Plays DVD+-R/Ws, CD-R/W media, MP3 files on CD or DVD, All region DVDs, VCD, SVCD, JPEGS with slideshow, audio CDs, PAL format on NTSC televisions. 15 pin VGA output, Component output, Optical Audio, Coaxial Audio, Composite output, 2 seperate MIC inputs for karaoke function - I plugged my electric guitar straight in. Wow.CONS:DON'T LOSE the small paper that comes with it to set ""Region free"". Short filenames on screen Explorer menu for MP3s and JPEG CDs. Default Video & Audio options are not for a home theater system, you need to tweak it if you want to use DTS and progressive scan. Unit can run hot - needs adequate ventilation.You won't find better at this price."
1,Disappointed,"I bought this DVD player from yamakawa.com. I tested it once I got it. This player did not work well. The play freez frequently. The remote could not open/close the player. The worst is that when I contacted the seller, I was told that the player has no problems and I have to pay the 15% restocking fee(they even did not see it yet, meaning they will charge you 15% if you return it even the player does not work)! So, my advice, don't waste time and money. If you want a nice code free DVD player, buy the Deawoo from COSTCO."
4,Great product,"I bought this as insurance for my Powerbook. With it, I would always have enough ports for my USB products. It is petite, always works and lights up...great product.I have bought three for various machines and consider it a must buy for PowerBook or MacBook owners."
2,"If you generally don't eat gummy bears, don't get it!","I bought this purely on curiosity on why it's so highly rated. So when I tried it, there isn't anything special about these gummy bears.. don't waste your time or $ if you generally don't care about gummy bears."
5,best gummy bears out there,"Recently purchased these using the kindle with special offers grocery coupon. We have been eating them ever since. They are the best tasting gummy bears out there. My son loves them, my wife loves them, and I love them. Highly recommend if you are going to buy candy."
5,Yummy!!,THey tasted like my favorite candy Gummy Bears. They tasted amazing!! And they provided all 12 bags... I cant say that i shared most of them but i did share :) The only downfall is that they went by to fast. :) I recommend if you love gummy bears or know someone who does. I wish i had some more now ;)
4,The best gummi bears out there!,"From my experience as a gummi bear lover and amateur connoisseur, I have found that Haribo consistently makes the best gummi bears. However, if you purchase a big bag and fail to eat them quickly, they will get hard. That's why this 12-pack of 5-oz bags is perfect for those who want to satiate their gummi bear cravings without overindulging. Subscribe and Save also allows you to replenish your gummi bear stock periodically at a lower price than most grocery stores or discount stores (e.g. Walmart or Target)."
2,nothing to write home about!,"I thought that I'd really enjoy these but they're so overrated!! I usually like gummi bears but these just aren't that good, I could have bought Walmart's brand and been just as happy! I will now be ordering these or buying these again EVER!! I spent too much and they didn't taste that good, too bad I didn't know how awful they were before I bought... Yuck a real waste of money!!:("
3,I think we got a stale batch.,"These were not the gummi bears we wanted. They tasted okay, but they were almost hard and way chewier than we like and were expecting."
1,Melted bears,The shipment came quick enough but the Gummi Bears were all melted together in one big glob. Wasted a lot of money and the Gummi's were for a party I was throwing. SO I had to run out to an outlet mall to get them.
2,Made me sick!!!,After eating these gummi bears my husband and I experienced intense stomach discomfort similar to a stomach virus. I wil never order these again.
3,Not Vegetarian,"I don't think any gummi bears are really better than others. I just wanted to note that this product is listed under ""Vegetarian"" foods, but they are not vegetarian because they contain gelatin.Just a note. Now, back to your regularly-scheduled Amazon shopping."
5,I am in love!,"This has been by far, the best yoga mat I have found. I have burned through a few cheaper mats that are usually falling apart after a few weeks of Ashtanga Yoga. Now I am a few weeks into this mat and see no signs of wear. It looks as good as the day I received it plus it is the perfect thickness. Thick enough to cushion your poses but thin enough to hold them strong. Only bit of advice...it is a little slick & does have a heavy rubber smell the first couple of uses but a mat wash will fix that right up."
4,Great Mat,This is a great yoga mat. I needed a thicker mat and this one did the trick. It is a little slippery at first but that goes away quickly. The colors are also very pretty
4,late read,"Perfect, read late sleep late is my motto with this light. Enough light to read by. I read late and finish a good book."
3,Get the right adapter,I accidentally ordered this adapter because it was listed on the Zelco LED booklight page - but it only works with the bulb version. There is a different AC adapter for the LED booklight - so make sure you are getting the right one.
2,The plug doesn't stay plugged in the adapter!,"The plug cannot be correctly plugged all the way into the adapter, which means that every time you move it becomes unplugged... then you have to get out of bed to plug it back in.Other than that, I love not having to buy batteries all the time for a booklight."
3,A likeable and quirky PI!,"This is the second book in the Kinsey Millhone, aka Alphabet Mystery, series.Kinsey Millhone, Private Investigator, is hired by a woman to find her sister, who appears to have gone missing, in order to settle a relative's estate.When I started this book, I forgot it was written back in 1985 when parachute pants and Mohawks were in style and people didn't email and use the internet or cell phones! How archaic to have to use the typewriter instead of the computer ;) I have forgotten how different everything was back then!Kinsey is a very likeable protagonist: she's a bit of a loner, quirky, self-reliant, and tough.Grafton's books are a fast read for me, and I enjoy them.I also like Mary Peiffer's narration of these books. She did the first one as well.MY RATING: 3.5 stars!"
2,B is for bit boring,"Sue Grafton's alphabet books start off very slowly and I wasn't that impressed with the first few. I stuck with it, though, and read all the way to ""V"", her latest in the series, and have really enjoed them as they have gone along."
5,I love the details of a P.I.'s life,"I love Kinsey Milhone and one of the things I love about this book is not only is there a very interesting puzzle to solve, but we get a glimpse of all the details it takes for the detective to solve them. I like seeing the mundane little efforts she makes because so often we're just told answers without knowing how they were obtained. This book is very satisfying."
4,Fun to read,"I started this series because I read the Stephanie Plum numbered series and find them fun. Sue Grafton's Kinsey Milhone series is just as fun to read. There aren't as many strange characters to hinder or aid Kinsey as in the Stephanie books. But the story line is just as entertaining, and intelligent.Makes for good diversion reading."
4,B for Burglar,Sue Grafton is a new author to me. I liked A for Alibi and I liked B for Burglar as well. The story keeps moving and there is enough happening to make you want to know what the next page brings. Kinsey Millhone is just enough tough and enough human to be believable. I like the way the author writes.
4,Very nice color even for dark hair,I love the color that tend to be more ashy than any other hair blond color but it doesn't stay longer than two to three wash..My hair is dark brown I used it for the roots but after a month it turned orangy had to stop dying my hair .
3,"Pretty good, not the best.","I have been a Jackson Browne fan for about 30 years, I consider him theJohn Updike of songwriting. My favorite JB album of the last 20 years was World in Motion, which I think is vastly underrated.I recently purchased the 'Ride Home' cd, intrigued by the title of thecd. JB has had so many songs about death that I thought the title was a a reference to death, either borrowed or created by the songwriter.I was a bit disappointed to listen to the title track and discover thatthere was nothing philisophical about the song. I didn't care for the cd upon first listen, however the 2nd time around I found it more interesting. I liked Sergio Leone and Don't You Want to be There,both are very different from what I expect from JB. The latter could be recorded by a gospel artist, the lyrics are general enough to be open to differing interpretations. Overall, it's a keeper, probably ranking towards the middle of his output."
5,So Lovely And Singular A Story,"""What seems like accident becomes tinged with purpose, the comfortably familiar disturbed by the impulse to escape. Only Anne Tyler with her original view could make Leary irresistible, and produce SO LOVELY AND SINGULAR A STORY."" (Reviews for Readers)[from the piece of paper on the back case]"
3,Disappointing performance,"For some reason, this performance is cold. Keenlyside is a fine artist, but no matter how much he strips down, he is not convincing, and lacks charisma. Leporello is also a fake plebeian. The Donna Anna is weak. Joyce Di Donato is an excellent singer, but she is miscast here. Ramon Vargas is the best of the men, as good as anybody ever, and so is Miah Perrson, who does have plenty of charm and plenty of voice.The production itself is boring.I don't recall any other Don Giovanni that has left me with no desire to look at it again."
4,A Good Introduction,"This is a well-written introduction to the history of the development of the Orthodox liturgy. It is easy to read and uncluttered by jargon. The author provides snapshots of the liturgy at various stages of its development, with particular emphasis on how the practicalities of worship at the great church in Constantinople influenced this development.I would recommend this book to anyone new to this fascinating subject."
3,Seems like a collection of PBS footage,"It did save me a trip to King's Canyon in December, so I'm glad I picked it up. I expected more though, it seemed like a collection of public television footage over the years. There wasn't enough footage of the park, especially during different seasons. Wish I'd rented it from the library instead of buying it."
5,Just what the doctor ordered,Most impressed with this album and to be honest better than expected.It gains legs with each listen.
4,Mommy's Helper,"I constantly read to my 4 an 1 1/2 year old daughters, but sometimes Mommy is a little tired from being Mommy all day. These stories are enjoyable, well told and familiar. My kids love it when I put them on during nap time or bedtime, and by the time the CD is finished, they are usually both snoozing. Most of the time I will lie there and listen, too. A couple of times my husband has had to shake me awake long after the stories have ended, so they work for tired mommies, too! I've sent this CD to many of my friends. It makes a great birthday gift or a gift for an older sibling when a baby is born (I send Baby's First Guitar or Baby's First Sleepytime for the baby). This whole series is affordable and well done! I can't believe the price for the high quality of the product!"
4,Great for Pumping Iron,"I have continually bought Mechanix gloves over the years for both working on my vehicles and pumping iron at the gym. On the gym side I have owned various full fingered gloves and half-fingered gloves specifically made for gym use over the years and Mechanix gloves have always been my favorite. If you are looking for thick padded gloves you need to man up and forget that thick crap and slide your meat hooks into these babies as they will keep you lifting heavy and focused on the iron, not your paws. They also hold up relatively well after several washing machine cycles ( yeah ya gotta wash them every now and again fellas, hang dry them!)and keep the huge calluses off your hands which your special lady friend will be thankful for when you're feeling her up."
3,So-so gloves,"These gloves are okay for the price I guess, I wish they had leather on the tips of the pointer and thumb parts of the gloves. Holes in those areas happen fast during heavy use."
1,Virtually no protection,I bought these because I was tired of getting brused fingers when playing airsoft. These offer less protection for that than the cheap cotton gloves I was already using. The new version of this glove has plastic ribs over the fingers to protect against hand shots but they cost a lot more.
2,Good idea but if falls apart,"We registered for this mat hoping that it would be great to use as cushioning in the play room and a fun learning tool as our baby grew. And it does cushion, when it's not falling apart. The edging and the centers to the letters and numbers, and the letters and numbers themselves, are always popping up as our baby crawls on them, catching her hand or foot the wrong way. It just doesn't stay together - we've tried everything. It's really more annoying than it's worth. Now we use it outside under our daughter's kiddie pool for a little cushioning - I don't care if it blows away at this point. What a waste of money. They sell larger squares w/o letters and numbers - I'll maybe try those instead."
4,Very Useful Playmat,"Our seven month old is too young to use this as a toy. It is, nonetheless, a GREAT playmat to cushion his tush from hardwood floors. He ""reads"" his books sitting on it, he crawls on it, rolls around on it, drools on it and plays with his age appropriate toys on it. As far as the small pieces getting dislodged, they can be temporarily taped in place from the back side so that they do not pop out until the child is old enough to use them and learn with them."
3,Safety Hazard - Zipper on bag broke 1st time it was used,"We received this at our baby shower and were thrilled. However, the first time we used it the zipper broke off the storage bag. Without the bag there is no good way to move it and store it. The zipper breaking off is a safety hazard. There was no contact number for the manufacturer, no address, only a website that was no longer valid. I searched the internet and found the phone number for the manufacturer and they were unwilling to help me. They did not even give me a tracking number where they were tracking the complaint. They just said that since I had it more than 90 days it was not under any warranty. They said the zippers did not usually break off.Please if you own one of these and the zipper has broken off your bag contact the Consumer Protection Agency..."
3,Muted Pastels,"There are a lot of melancholy boys with access to computer technology writing depressive near ambient symphonies to their own isolation. Marc Bianchi, recording as Her Space Holiday, is one of the good ones. On his second release, Manic Expressive, he stops navel-gazing long enough to mix it up in the real world. Of course, he does it quietly - his electronic palette is full of muted pastels, whispers - he's coming to your dinner party, not the New Year's Eve celebration in Times Square. But he's absorbed and processed a number of wide-ranging influences in his bedsit: Philip Glass, Can, Vivaldi, Belle and Sebastian, Kraftwerk, Bach. To my taste, more interesting as ambient than Aphex Twin or any number of faceless trance remixers."
4,An overall good book that needs some update and expansion.,"Two knowledgable authors gave in-depth treatments on the subject of DCM. The math is fairly easy to follow in most places. The biggest strength is a nice combination of theoretical and practical issues. The readers however should be benefitted from a new edition, which should include, among other things, extended exposures on ordered responses and grouped/aggregated data analyses with DCM. An introduction to the existing software and relevant issues should also be a plus."
1,"Hard to use, do not but from Hermanstreet","I am used to the Broderbund 3D 3.0. It is simple to use but even they have become more dificult to use in the latter versions. It is hard to do one section of a house at a time, and make adjustment to rooms. It's is a program for someone who knows what they want for a floor plan in the beginning. I would like to work backwards. start with the one room, with furniture, add the next room. then if I like the plan, then work on the roof and foundation. unfortunately the Broderbund 3.0 version does not work on Vista, or the campatibility mode."
1,Major disapointment!!!,"I purchased this software thinking that it would provide me with a bit more that just a drawing program. This software is nothing more than a drawing toy!! I am in the process of building a very modest cabin and I was hoping that this software would assist me, in some way, with the architectural/engineering aspects (i.e. load bearing walls, floor joist spans, etc.) and found out that it doesn't do more than draw pictures. The entire interface leaves a lot to be desired and is not intuitive! I've abandoned this software and pulled out my drafting ruler and sketch pad to finish my cabin.Sorry Punch..."
5,Purge,"This CD is not an exemption to the rule, great music and vocals. I don't know why it was titled ""Purge"" but I would like to say that a ""purge"" is needed to get rid of those untalented but famous! pop singers."
4,A excellent adjunct to heraldic study,"Since a motto is not usually an integral part of a Grant of Arms, it can be adopted or changed at will . . . nor need one ever possess arms to adopt a motto. Originally published in 1860, these were collected not only from peerages and county histories, but from bookplates, carriages, plaques in churches, and other sources. One of my favorites is ""Latet anguis in herba"" -- ""The snake lurks in the grass,"" adopted by the Anguish family."
3,A love story without a whole lot of love.,"While unmistakably Green is a skilled if idiosyncratic novelist, and the focus of its attention is on a quite charming story of love between two servants in an English/Irish household, that central story is muffled into unexcitement. Green does contrast the virtue and integrity of the servants' love relationship with that of the aristocrats' adulterous hypocrisy. And there is a sense of verrisimilitude about both the worlds of ""upstairs"" and ""downstairs"". But, finally, the central story tells us more than it shows about the loving relationship, without display, without actions sufficient to be compelling. Maybe that's a comment in itself on English society of this World War II period. But it makes for a dry read."
5,Don't be put off by those who have missed the point,"I'm sad that the reader from Maine felt so insulted by Mr Green's work. I can only guess that he or she thought they had bought a contemporary pot-boiler to read on the airplane and were shocked to find they were reading a 20th century classic, because the criticism of the dialogue was entirely unjustified. The dialogue in Loving is wonderful - precisely because it is so clearly of another age. It is through the language of this novel that we understand and become enmeshed by its central themes."
3,An up close and personal look . . .,"I liked this novel, originally published in a black journal from 1925 through 1926. The details of Davy Carr's middle class existence were sometimes too tedious for my liking, but for anyone who is interested in the daily lives of African Americans during the Roaring Twenties, this book is a must read.I've read a lot of Edith Wharton and WHEN WASHINGTON WAS IN VOGUE fits nicely with Wharton's insider look at polite society and its pitfalls. There was a lot of discussion in this book about ""passing"" and ""light skinned"" girls, but the story didn't shed much light on the real issues of race. Instead the reader learned about dazzling dinner parties, week-ends in the country and late night card games.There is a love story buried in the book, too. Although there's no real conflict or struggles in the novel, it's worth a few afternoons of your time.Enjoy."
1,Poor suction cups,The suction cups on the back didn't work and the sides would stick up. We ended up not using the product.
3,Just okay,"I probably wouldn't buy this again because it doesn't really stick at all to the cast iron sink. I had to take some museum putty and put it on the suction cups to get it stick to the sink. Before I bought this I went to Big Lots and found a sink mat for the bottom of a sink and cut it to size to fit over the hump and attached it with museum putty and it seemed to fit better, protect better (because it was little bit thicker rubber), and was cheaper ($3.00 compared to $10 I paid for this). I probably wouldn't buy this again and would just go back to the bottom mat and cutting it to fit on the hump."
5,"Gilbert Strang's ""Calculus",I most strongly recommend this treatment of the most fundamental knowledge needed to comprehend advanced mathematics and the physical sciences.
2,Alpha Derma,"The reason for my low rating on this product is that it costs so much more than other facial lotions that claim to improve the look of aging on the face, but did nothing more than any of the rest of them.....which is basically to just moisturize."
1,AACCCK. ABSOLUTELY Putrid.,"One of the worst CDs I have ever heard. Is this for real? Sounds like someone doing karoke and trying to sound like a ""hick"" by changing their voice and accent. This should be rated no more than 1/2 star, but I can't do that."
2,disappointing,"I love the Amelia Peabody novels by Elizabeth Peters, but I'm finding it hard to believe this book was written by the same person. The dialogue is lame, the characters are cliches, the humor falls flat, there is a lot of filler, the characters are constantly explaining things to each other (for the reader's benefit) that all of them should know already, and the plot goes nowhere fast. To be fair, the Amelia Peabody novels aren't terribly plot-focused either, but they are funny. This one just doesn't work.On the positive side, I continue to be astonished by the virtuosity of the audiobook reader, Barbara Rosenblatt. I'd listen to just about anything if she was reading it."
2,a mixed bag,"While interesting enough to keep me reading, overall the book wasn't what I might have expected. Loaned to me, I had not read any of her previous work. The characters were too artificial, until I decided that perhaps the whole thing was a parody of the gothic novels it revolved around. But in the end, I decided it was just poorly written - especially with major questions unanswered such as the noise in the clearing, and its function as the major deus ex machina of the book"
2,Not a prime gothic....,"For entertaining, enjoyable reads, there are MANY published gothics that are better than ""Houses of Stone"". At times, I thought of the book as a documentary analysis of early gothics. Once during the book, Peggy told Karen ""okay, I've had enough of that spiel"". (I was thinking like Peggy.) One of the points Barbara Michaels made in the book was that early female writers were not respected for their talents, and I didn't know that Hawthorne was so vicious with his pen in that area. I saw several parallels in reading the book. Karen thought she was still struggling for respect in the literary arena. The manuscript itself had many similarities to the current storyline of the book. I'm glad I read ""Houses of Stone"" as it was my first Barbara Michaels book. But truthfully, if a person is reading for entertainment and relaxation, ""Houses of Stone"" would not be on my list of recommendations."
4,Nice and Comfortable,"I guess one has to be a certain type of person to appreciateMichaels (or Peters). You have to be a COZY person--a person who comeshome exhausted on Fridays, and doesn't want to read deep allegorical nonsense. One doesn't pick up a novel like ""Houses of Stone,"" expecting to be aroused to dizzing intellectual highs. You pick it up to relax, to make friends with some interesting, delicious, scholarly people. You pick it up because it's like coming home. Readers who enjoyed this novel should also read ""Shattered Silk"" by the same author."
1,"Hit or Miss with Barbara, this one is a miss...","The story was stilted, with the main plot premise built around the ""who done it"" at the end. The story was weak, the characters not like-able, and very transparent. You want to read good historical gothic fiction, there is some very good books out there... ""The Thirteenth Tale"", ""Nine Coaches Waiting"", ""Rebecca"" ""Kirkland Revels"""
2,Doesn't match description,"Well, I bought this set because the description gives the language options as English, German, Hindi, and Punjabi and I really wanted the Hindi soundtrack to practice my language learning with.Unfortunately, it does not have a Hindi soundtrack. Like most DVDS, the languages are English, French, or Spanish. That's it.However, I did buy it from one of the third party sellers, so there's a slim chance it was a different product, though the cover looks the same and it's the same grouping of movies."
4,Go ahead and buy it,"The sound is great in DTS 5.1 surround. Yes, the video is poor for BluRay. That is the problem with modern technology, it blows away 1983 technology. If you were watching this on your 1983 TV it would be GREAT. I am sure for a $1,000,000 you could fix the video, but then the price point would be much higher. And for an old catalog item like this, not likely to go triple platinum on BluRay, I am sure the producers weren't going for that. I bought it without regard to the 1 star reviews and am quite pleased with my purchase."
2,Wouldn't buy again.,These smell like plastic. They don't have very much flavor and are also very hard in texture. I wouldn't buy them again.
2,Just OK for me,I tried these as a test and found them to be OK. But I still prefer the classic Gummi Bears.
3,not what I expected,Sorry I thought I ordered a CD and recieved an audio cassette. My mistake but it was disapointing.I recieved the product on time.
5,This is AWESOME!!,This is the best CD you can ever get. It's got latest songs like Mr. Lonely and older songs like She's A Lady by Tom Jones. You have to get this!
5,Excellent book...,"...it didn't lose my interest = it wasn't boring. Sure, it's short, but the author manages to fill it with facts. Too bad this one's out of print. I had a really hard time finding a biography on this fascinating woman, so when I picked this up I thought it wouldn't be great (hey, I got tired searching for an hour). I was wrong. If you need to do schoolwork on the Byzantine era, particularly the reign of Justinian I, then pick this one up."
2,KATELAND,"I think the title of this documentry, TRAPPED IN AN ELEVATOR could be abit misleading. ""ELEVATORS"" would be more of an appropriate title for it. This is more of a study on elevators. How they looked when first invented. The purpose they serve all over the world. The workings of them. What makes them go UP and DOWN. The mechanical side of it all. How they were able to build skyscrapers, showing that elevators made it all possible. You were shown a video of a person trapped in an elevator. But the quality of the video was so poor, you were unable to make anything from it. Iv given this DVD just 2 stars. Because i grew very tired of watching Elevators."
2,A Disappointment from a Grand Master,"This book is really four novelettes retrofitted around ""The Ultimate Earth,"" a novelette which (inexplicably) won all sorts of awards. Like a lot of ""novels"" that are jury-rigged around extended short stories, this one has all the weaknesses and few of the strengths that other such novels have. (The best novel of this kind is Fred Pohl's Years of the City, a clear masterpiece.) I found the only good section of this book to be the first. It sets up a remarkable premise and sets about unfolding it rather well. But by the time the book ends, you really don't know who is who and the far future earth seems more like modern-day Africa. Not a single imaginative trope in sight.This would be an excellent first book, however. Unfortunately, it isn't. The five star ratings this book has received clearly are given to the man and not the work. This isn't a good place to start with one's reading of Jack Williamson."
2,BEWARE! Not as Advertised!,"These clubs are actually square. Don't let the picture fool you. I ordered this set, thinking it would be a good, NORMAL bag of clubs, but I was deeply mistaken.If you are expecting clubs that don't look ridiculous, get yourself a Callaway or something."
1,"These are not phonics - there are only beginning letters, not the...","ou words, nor any of the others - ie silent 'b' in climb for example, none of the inside phonics that give children the most problems. Any idiot can learn the abc's that start words! These are very very basic and hardly complete!"
3,Family Guy Freakin Party Pak,First off I must say I love the Family Guy series. There are two things I do not like about this item though. The first thing is I think they could have picked some better items to put in with the dvd's. The second is the dvd's come in full screen format when there are hardly any full screen tv's left out there.
3,Pictured item did not match actual product.,"I ordered Zupreem small parrot diet intended for lovebirds, cockatoos, etc. but received the 3lb. bag of the medium intended for greys which are much larger pellets. I ended up having to pulse grind them in the food processor so my little guy didn't have to wait 2 weeks for the replacement. Further examination shows the actual picture of the ""medium"" parrot diet but the invoice and cart showed small."
1,No up to scratch,"Sorry to disgree with the other reviewers, but I found the performance of these headphones well below par. I bought them for my wife before we flew to Germany, and I have tried them out on a number of flights since. I have found myself switching the noise cancelling on and off a number of times to check if it is actually doing anything.I also found that wearing the headphones for any longer than 1 hour makes my ears hurt because of the pressure on them.In comparison, I also have the a set of Targus headphones, and these are brilliant. When I switch on the noise cancelling, I have to turn the audio on the in-flight entertainment down to it's lowest level, otherwise it is too loud now that all the background sound is removed.Regards,Brett"
3,Not bad...,"These headphones do a fairly good job of blocking out noise, mostly in the low frequencies. Unfortunately, as several customers have mentioned, the noise blocking features tend to add hiss and reduce the music volume. Other than that, the sound quality is reasonably good, if a little top-heavy.I frequently become frustrated with the noise-cancelling box attached to the cord. The cords tend to become even more knotted and twisted than usual because of this configuration, and the box is often awkward to carry around. It usually needs to be held in the hand.I have fairly average-sized ears (perhaps a tad large), and these headphones do not cover their entire surfaces. This can make them uncomfortable if worn for a long time, especially when wearing eyeglasses."
1,Piece of garbage,"These headphones don't do what they are supposed to, cancel external noise. On top if it adds it own hiss. In other words, you are better off using a regular pair of headphones (or one of the noise blocking earbuds) than these ""noise-cancelling"" ones. I bought mine about three years back, had thrown them into my basement because they did not work, but just rediscovered them after moving to a new place. I'm astonished this model is still selling. Don't buy it; I'm about to try the Sony MDR-NC6."
2,Leaks attracts bees,"I really love the look of this hummingbird feeder, and the hummingbirds were definitely drawn in too. The only problem is that it leaked. The design problem that caused the leaks is the 2 piece base. The copper metal cover sits on top of the plastic basin and the glass bottle screws into the plastic base, compressing the metal top down against the plastic base. The seam between the 2 parts seemed to leak the most when it was hot out, and once it did, bees were all over it. I know bees can be a problem with many hummingbird feeders, but the problem was much worse since the leaking would cause sugar to coat the surface of the base. I wish I could find a way to keep the bees away because I love the looks of this feeder, but there's no simple way to keep it from leaking."
3,"Beautiful, but..","This feeder is really pretty and looks beautiful hanging off my deck. Unfortunately, the hummingbirds don't necessarily feel the same way. I've always used the basic inexpensive glass feeders and usually have to refill them every 2-3 days throughout the summer. With this feeder though, I get one or two hummingbirds a day checking it out for a couple of sips before they fly off. I've washed it, I've changed the nectar regularly, and I've tried different nectar strengths over the last couple of months, but nothing seems to help. I wish I knew why. Meanwhile, I will keep this for it's looks, but will put up one of the tried & true $8.00 feeders so I can enjoy the bird watching."
2,nice while it lasted,"This feeder was great the first year, but the screw in connection cracked and leaked after one season"
2,Beautiful but flawed,"This was my first feeder. I bought it based on looks and the overall good ratings. I had two birds visiting it in no time. Unfortunately I don't have a garden to attract more so they didn't go through the nectar very fast, and I had to toss 2/3. This feeder has a narrow opening making it challenging to clean. First time I went to clean it, I discovered a crack in the neck, that wasn't there the first time I filled it up. I wont be putting this back up for fear that the bottom half is going to break off completely."
4,hope it's worth ot,"Just received this beautiful feeder tow days ago. Was filling it with home-made hummingbird food when the glass slipped out of the metal rim piece and smashed into a million pieces in the sink. :(I have no idea how it works, or looks hanging, but I'll buy another one, it's really pretty."
3,Nice feeder,"I really like the look of this feeder. The only problem I find with it is that it attracts too many bumble bees. Hummingbirds have to fight the bees in order to take a drink. Besides that, I am very pleased with it."
1,ugly and impossible to clean,"The product arrived looking like it had been manufactured by a three year old. The vine wrap was clumped near the base and uneven, barely holding the glass globe. Figuring the hummingbirds wouldn't care how it looked, I took it apart and cleaned it, only to find the opening is so small I couldn't get a bottle brush in it. I rinsed it and set it out to air dry, but it took three days, since no air could get in. A bird feeder which can't be cleaned will only breed mold and eventually poisen the very birds I wanted to feed. I'm returning it, or if that's not allowed, I'll throw it away."
5,Opus Avant Garden Looking Glass,Absolutely beautiful. I love it! Sturdy and large enough to hold a large quantity of hummingbird food.
5,Wonderful hummingbird feeder,"We have two of thise on our back porch and they attract hummingbirds very well, besides being addractive. All of the parts that are exposed to sunlight are either metal or glass, so we expect this to last for years. They are also simple to clean and refill."
1,DISAPPOINTTED PACKAGE,I DID'NT EVEN GET TO USE IT BECAUSE OF THE PACKAGE FROM THE COMPANY IT CAME FROM THE OIL WAS SPILL ALL IN THE BAG
5,Healthier Feeling Hair,I have biracial tight curly hair. I had not done a deep conditioning in a while. My hair was very dry and unhealthy looking and feeling. My hair felt very nourished after the first use.
4,It stretches!!!!,I purchased this a few months ago and based off the other reviews I ordered the small hoping it would fit my larger coffee table...it didn't. It did fit the smaller coffee table but now that my son has pulled himself up using this it has stretched out...A LOT. I am now constantly pulling it back up so it covers edges of table. I also have to watch for my son's fingers getting stuck between bumper and table. Definitely by smaller than you think since it will stretch. I must say that I love the fact there is no tape to ruin furniture and my son has quickly learned to pull himself up by grabbing this bumper.
3,Not suitable for thin table,"It's really a good idea for baby's safety.The board of my table is not thick enough,so this edge bumper can't coat it totally.If you want buy this bumper,please be sure your table board is thick."
1,Useless,"About 2 minutes after we put this bumper on the coffee table, my 9-month-old son pulled up on it, easily pulled the bumper away from the edge, lost his balance (because he was holding the stretchy bumper instead of the table), and smacked his chin hard on the sharp edge of the table. Needless to say we are returning this useless product."
1,Dud,"Avoid this chip.I lost a bunch of photos using this chip in a Canon 510 Powershot.Not only would the photos not transfer to my G4 Mac with iPhoto 5,using a Lexar media USB card reader the computer locked up when I initiated transfer.The chip was formatted in the camera as soon as it was inserted.After formatting again and taking a few test exposures, the chip once more locked up the computer.The photos appear on the camera screen, but the chip crashes the Mac every time.The chip also frequently fails to initiate iPhoto when inserted in the reader, which all my other chips do initiate properly.I use the same reader and software for four other SD and Compact Flash chips (non Kodak) from three other Canons, with no problem.The 16MB chip that came with the 510 camera works fine.The Kodak chip is not only unusable, it crashes iPhoto 5 on the Mac."
5,Due North,"I was also captivated, and now haunted by this book. Although I lack the character this woamn had, I identified with her in so many ways. The scene of her husband getting mauled by the bear is forever engraved in my head. I can't believe it is out of print; this book should be required reading for everyone."
5,A book I shall remember for ever,"I read a lot of novels. Sometimes I forget the name of the author, more often I forget the name of the book. The first words of Due North I shall remember for ever - and I only read it once. After borrowing this extraordinary book from the library I went out to buy copies for myself and for my friends. I was devastated to find it was already out of print. No author deserves such a short life for his work, and especially not for a work as strong as this. The first line? If you want to know, you'll just have to find the book and read it. Badger the publisher into a reprint."
2,Not Tom's fault here... Read on...,"Tom Valentine has had points inhis tough life where he has hadto struggle. He left the ChicagoSun Times Sports in 1973 to gowork as number two man at the'National Tattler', then numbertwo tabloid, competition to theSpotlight. His jog (?); WeeklyMiracle Editor. This book aboutTibetan religious / miracle manis about on par with his 1974Psychic Surgery or masonic-like'Man's Monument to Man, TheGreat Pyramid', book of 1975.There is some good stuff andinteresting stuff in here butit was strickly for the money.Tom became a born again Christianlater and all his books, healthand otherwise did him better inimage also his great Christian-Patriotic-Revisionist radio show(s)."
1,did not receive,"I do not know where this was delivered but I did not receive it . I do not know wnere to go to findout why. If you cannot take care of this I will not order any more from this site. Sincerely, Linda G Chanek"
5,cats and dogs,"The DVD was shipped and delivered very quickly! Glad I bought the movie. It's not as great as the first one, but it still keeps my kids entertained."
5,Funny movie,"This movie is just as funny to adults as to kids, I love the montage at the end set to ""Why Can't We Be Friends"". Too cute."
3,Good fun,"While not a sheer classic, it is a very fun movie. Lots of one-liners, sight gags and references to spy movies from yesteryear. Most of these jokes will go over the heads of kids and teens, but are good for a chuckle if you know the references. The animated animals are better than in the first movie because technology has advanced since the first one came out but they still have that Disney animatronic look. Not a movie to pay full price for but get it used or at a discount and it's worth having for the kids."
4,Love the shoe - but beware of sizing,"I bought these shoes in my usual size and had to exchange them for a half size smaller... They are great shoes, but they run big!"
2,Self Serving Dribble,"I found this book to be boring, Pat Nee is a self serving person. It does not depict the real South Boston or the things that took place. Everything he wrote about from his experiences in the service to his dealings with Whitey Bulger were always an almost succeeded. It sounds like he was always riding some ones coat tails, even the documentary Bullets over Boston he came off as just a punk. I don't reccomend this book. If you want to learn about the true story I recommend Black Mass or The Brothers Bulger."
3,Exactly what I ordered,Press board was a little light. Other then that the are fine. Clips are well mounted and it has good capacity.
1,Ouch! That was painful,"You know ""that guy"" that talks just to hear himself speak? This book is the written version of ""that guy.""Complete fluff cover to cover!"
5,"Peace, at last",This is a wonderful cd! I use it to meditate or to help me relax from a stressful day or when I do reiki treatments/massages on friends. Absolutely wonderful!
3,Very relaxing,This cd is very helpful in aiding meditation. It was physically moving the first time I listened to it.
3,If you like this genre...,"This book might not be what you're expecting. As the other reviewers point out, it's more about his experiences than anything. The author avoids almost any editorializing, which I wish he would have inserted more often. I personally like this genre, which I would call the ""behind-the-scenes"" look at different, often esoteric, religious expressions. To write a book like this involves a long time, many interviews, and the willingness to participate in a variety of often strange religious ceremonies and events (and, in his case, apparently alot of money to pay for Deepak Chopra's and other's seminars). If you're at all Catholic, I would recommend Michael Cumeo's ""Smoke of Satan"" and ""American Excorcism"" as excellent examples within this type of religious writing.Overall, Gooch's book was a page-turner but, again, should be read more for pleasure and subtle insight than for systematic treatments of ""spirituality in America."""
5,great product,"I love this cookbook! it is so cute and very handy. I love the silverware theme. Overall great product, I would buy it for a gift for a friend."
2,Better towards the end,"Pure determination was the only reason I finished this book. I just cannot stand to not finish a book. It is not that this book is poorly written, it just isn't my tast I guess.The story is about an Austrailian boy named Peter who enjoys riding dirt bikes. When Peter meets his brother's gay friend David, Peter starts wondering if he is gay. Unlike most books in this genre, it is not a coming out or coming of age story. This fact is the most refreshing aspect of the book.Despite my mediocre rating, this book is still ok. I'm just not Austrailian or a dirt biker. You will probably find this book more interesting than me if you like dirt bikes or cars."
4,Good Preparation,"This book gives nice, brief explanations of all the required topics on the Physics AP while going more in-depth in the example problems. The only downfall, and this may be true with other prep books too, is that the practice problems aren't similar enough to the real AP problems to give you good practice. The practice test is rather discouraging, but most prep books are harder than the real AP. In short, learn from this book, but don't practice too much from it."
4,Great overall but only focuses on the harder aspects,"The Princeton Review did a great job with this book; it covers everything you need to know and more. It does have one drawback, however. This book focuses on preparing you for the hard questions on the test without spending enough time on the simpler, more conceptual questions (which the AP test does cover). If this book were to be used in conjunction with Barron's AP Physics, you'd have all your bases covered. I used those two books to help me score my ""5"" in AP Physics B."
5,Christmas Carols for Solo Violin,This book has a beautifully designed glossy cover. The music in it is well written and edited. I found it particularly useful for adult students and younger violinists as well. The book is durable and printed on heavy weight paper. The selections are appropriate for the Holiday season with very interesting harmonies never before seen in my experience. I can recommend this book to anyone interested in adding it to a library of musical keepsakes.
1,The worstest book ever,My mommy read this as a bedtime story. I was so afraid. It kept me up. I couldn't sleep. Ratzlaff is a bad bad author. I could have written this.
2,"Funny, but poor quality","I bought this a while back, everyone laughed, I thought it was the greatest thing since sliced bread. And then the paint slowly went away. Now I have a blue mug..."
5,Amazing photos,"I am a big fan of Montana and it's wildlife and I am also an amateur photographer. I have quite a few books of this genre but this one really tops them all. The photographs are not only remarkable in their photographic quality, but they all have a unique aspect that sets them apart from other wildlife shots."
5,Leatherman-Wave,"My husband LOVES this leatherman. As long as I have ever known him, it has been on his belt. I'm always amazed at how many times it has come in handy. Now people ask him if they can use it when he's around. Love it!!"
5,Solid Leatherman,Over the last decade i've kept a Leatherman by my side to help me accomplish each task that comes my way. This New Wave tool handles many different tasks. I like the new blade lock style. I appreciate the comfort of the handles while using the pliers. It is a solid tool I expect will last many years.
4,Too simple,"I've generally found AMACOM books to be very good. This is a good book, just very simple, as I suspect are all of the books in the WorkSmart series (I've read 3). You can read this completely in one evening.If you've never heard of TQM, this book will have some value to you. If you've read anything on TQM, you have probably covered most of what's in this book. A good ""second"" book, that you can read in place of this or following, is ""Principles and Practices of Organizational Performance Excellence"", by Thomas Cartin, an excellent book."
1,Total Fiction,"Bill Flanagan is a high-level VH1 executive in real life, owing to an old friend pulling him into the business late in life. I was in the record business and I read half this book trying to make it make sense and ring true, because I thought it was based in fact, but I finally reached the point when it was just so far out of reality that I looked Mr. Flanagan up on the net and found out that he was never a high-level or any level label exec and has no particular love of music. He justifies making the fictionalized label reps the main characters in a world in which clearly the artists are the main characters by saying that he didn't think most people have an affinity for music people - which I suspects reflects his own opinion. Let me just say he's the last guy I'd want working A&R and determining which artists to sign. I prefer people who love music as much as the artists they are working with, and though there are exceptions, that is closer to the truth than this sterile novel."
4,Through A&R Eyes,"Having been on the Sales & Marketing side of this crazy buisness I can attest to many things in this book being true. My guess is that it is about BMG, and possibly Clive Davis."
3,"I like it, baby doesn't","This grape toy is so cute, and well-made. The only thing I have to complain about the way it's made is that they sewed a leaf on the front under the face, and the leaves all around head tend to curl up...the leaf in front, curls up right over the face, blocking it. If they had spaced the leaves just a little bit to the left, it would have either a space or just a little leaf that wouldn't cover the face should it curl up. Ah well, not a huge deal or anything.Unfortunately, as much I as I think it is awesome, baby has very rarely played with it and did not chew on it while teething (although I didn't try the freezing thing I just now read from other review). Have had it for baby from 5 months to 1 year old...I suppose it will be useful as a pretend toy when baby is older. It's a shame he has not enjoyed as the collection of fruits and veggies is adorable. I guess I'm glad I didn't break down and buy the whole lot."
2,Piano instrumentals,"These are quiet piano instrumentals with light accompaniment, good for background music. The disk includes ten songs from popular musicals, sounds like a single piano player, who is not identified, did them all."
4,like it,There are many cute designs in this book. Very resourceful. I would recommend it to others who cross stitch. Thanks
3,Works alright,"Unfortunately the product I recieved was not the one pictured, however it was an ipod car charger. I have a 4G ipod and it works to charge it, except it doesnt play music through the speakers like it says in the description. Pretty good for under $3 though and the red light is a nice touch."
4,Sturdy and more useful than I thought,"I got these because I use my headphones at the gym, at work, walking, etc. They come in packs of three and if you look around on amazon there are other color choices. I would have opted for the red white and black but these are fine too. I have some headphone with a thicker cord and they work OKAY, but they're best for standard plastic-y cords. They weight as much as a nickle."
4,What I Expected,These are nice and sturdy and do a good job of keeping the cords from tangling. They hold the cords pretty tight.
2,Pretentious and silly,"This is a book for sensitive college girls who see faces in the moon. For the rest of us, though, this book is ridiculous. The use of mythology is interesting, but degenerates into laugh out loud scenes of bare-breasted women chanting and summoning snakes. Furthermore, Washington is a poor choice for a setting, since it is NOT an old city, even by North American standards."
2,Just didn't work for me,"I really expected to like this one: campus setting, mysterious archeological finds, shy freshman coming out of her shell with seductive new friends, dark rituals--what's not to love? Unfortunately, the writing was the problem. The dialogue is too often stilted, the prose is clunky with lines like,'""Damn,"" Magda swore aloud.' There is just too much telling and describing, and that ruins the pacing as well as the immersiveness, (may have just made that word up), of the story.I just couldn't get involved enough with Sweeney and her friends, which is a shame because with Moon Goddesses and Benandati and moonlit passion, it seemed they did have quite a story to tell."
5,Johnny Russell's greatest recording,"We all miss seeing Johnny on the Opry these days. Johnny died last July and its not been the same on there. Johnny had some big hits, but I think this, his last recording, was his best. It is an acoustic type recording which really shows off his voice, but also its such great music. All of these songs were written by him, and truly he is one of country music's greatest songwriters. The guests are great too...especially Dolly Parton and Buck Owens. WOW! How did that happen in 2000? I rate this one at the VERY top!"
5,"Ignore the Microsoft label, this thing is great!","As an avid Mac fan and someone who's forced to use Windows at work, I saw the positive reviews for this mouse and figured I would put aside my anti-Microsoft bias and buy this bluetooth mouse for my laptop. Works beautifully, couldn't be happier with it."
4,"Oversimplifies things, yet a valuable book in itself","Steve Salerno takes the unfortunate viewpoint that self-help is pretty much impossible. For example, he mocks Tommy Lasorda saying ""ya gotta want it!"" on the speaker's circuit. However, mind set and attitude ARE where self improvement come from. I consider myself to be proof that self help works. I used to be not just painfully shy but socially phobic, and I worked through my issues step by step, with the help of self help books. However, I think everyone hardcore into self improvement owes it to themselves to read Sham, because it helps you put things into perspective. It's too easy to become seduced by ""gurus"" like Tony Robbins and take the good with the bad, like for example Robbins' pseudoscientific pablum about the energy frequencies of foods."
4,Good Expose,"I found Steve Salerno gave an in-depth overview of how folks can get black holed in the self improvement movement while not experiencing any improvement themselves but maybe some were a bit off topic. I was amazed about how AA is not accountable of their procedures and how alcoholism became classified as an illness because the medical profession would makes billions of $ in insurance claims, etc. However, I thought some of the political examples in the latter part of the book were not so relevant and in defence of SHAM, some of the things they actual do are good and useable!"
2,Good Episodes But...,"video transfer quality was poor. Lots of video noise artifacts, making enjoyment of episodes a struggle. Very disappointed. What kind of ""master"" did MGM use, a copy of a copy?! 2/5"
3,A Mixed Bag,"I bought this (""Sex and Science Fiction"") and ""Aliens Among Us."" I also bought ""Outer Limits, Season 1."" I don't know why I chose the ""grouped"" episodes instead of other seasons' (2,3..), since after having viewed them all, the ""Outer Limits, Season 1"" was definitely better and more enjoyable. I think it's a waste of money to buy the grouped episodes rather than ordering them by seasons."
4,Tremendo Disco !!!,"Este es el mismo disco que Firework, pero con un arte diferente.Lalo Rodriguez canta en ""1.Mi Ritmo Llego"" , ""2.Desilusion"" y ""4.Guaguanco a Mexico""Machito canta en ""3. Despierta Boricua"" y ""7. Soy Salsero""Instrumental ""6. Macho"".No me acuerdo quien de los dos canta en ""5. No Seras Para Mi"""
4,Highly Recommended to learn Speaking,"The great advantage to this system are that it's well-organized into 8 30-minute lessons, and it's all audio so you really can learn in your car. By continual repetition, the phrases get ingrained into your very system, and the words will always be there for you.One funny thing about these Pimsleur systems - they assume you are a man and the first thing you want to learn is how to hit on a woman (Miss, where would you like to have a drink? My place or yours?)Don't buy this if you want a comprehensive review of a lot of Greek vocabulary, grammar, or spelling, but definitely buy it if you want to feel like you can speak the language naturally."
1,Not so happy,"I bought it to to do some work on my car.This Grinder isnt worth the fight, it lacks power in so many ways. Used it like twice and the motor Burn out."
4,good for the money,"Bought this for use with a panasonic ag-dvx100 and I haven't been disappointed--the audio quality I've captured is much better than that with the factory mic. I wish I had seen the two-barrel version of this earlier...oh well. It takes an XLR cable (well that should be obvious from the description) so a buyer should be clear that they have 3pin XLR jack on whatever equipment it is they are recording into. This is a decent mic for $150, it won't blow you away but neither will the cost. Comes in a little pleather pouch, with a foam windscreen, shock isolating mount which screws into the hot shoe adapter and is better in design than the one standard with my camera, as well as some replacement rubber rings for the mount. The mic takes two AA batteries if I can recall. It has an off /on switch, and it has a cardioid/super-cardioid switch. Pretty basic....I'd like to mount this on a boom eventually..."
3,terrible soundtrack,"This collection of the greatest science fiction show ever IMHO, is almost ruined by the lousy sound quality. It's incredible that the engineers allotted so much bandwidth to the video and only (seeminlgly) 1 or so KHz to the audio. Still, what can you do - you need this collection if you're a mature sci fi fan."
4,Good for the Eyes / Bad for the Ears,"This is great stuff, especially if you came of age during its first run. Terrific sci-fi-noir camera work (Conrad Hall) and often silly but lovable plotlines. The image quality is good, often VERY good. Alas, some of the episodes seem to suffer from very heavy handed audio compression or noise reduction. I'd rather hear some hiss than the muffled distortion of some of this audio. My laserdiscs sound better.I'm ready for season 2."
2,blah.,It isn't as good as The Twilight Zone. very outdated. very corny. The hour long format is boring. I do not recommend this product to anyone.
3,Outer Limits Collection - Praise and Problem,"I dearly love this old series of my childhood. The film transfers are fantastic - the image sharpness is better than what we got on our old TV's. This collection falls down in one important area - the sound! The voice levels are ok but the background music is often barely heard or very faint. I get the feelingthat whoever was in charge of the sound mix was perhaps doing this unpurpose out of personal tatse. The sound mix is over filtered, occaisionally muddy but the real crime is the near loss of the wonderful background music that was very much a trademark of this old series. I would have been happy to have a little hiss to put some life back into the sound and keep the background music.Nephew of Bernard Herrmann"
3,They ruined my favorite comedy,"These comments are about the audiobook. Though it picked up in the 2nd act, the acting was terrible. The actors could have been anyone off the street saying Simon's hilariously funny lines. There was no characterization AT ALL. The exception was Victor (who despite his name sounded British). He had a personality that fit his lines and part. I kept hearing Mildred Natwick and Robert Redford and even Jane Fonda (and I thought that she ruined the movie) saying the now-familiar lines of the mother and Paul and Corrie. (I thought it was interesting to see how Simon moved lines and conversations from his play around for the movie - which is all I've ever seen.) Natwick and Redford BTW played the roles both on Bway and in the flick. It sounded like a recital or reading rather than a staged performance, not that that matters. I was very disappointed and recommend the movie over this, as far as the play goes there is not much difference, and the acting - well, there's acting."
4,'AM Gold - 1965' (Warner Special Products) Various Artists,"Total of 22 tracks from 1965, several that I have truly fond memories of hearing them blasting out of the family station wagon when I was a kid. Cuts like Petula Clark's ""Downtown"", Tom Jone's heart throb of a gem ""What's New Pussycat?"", Righteous Brother's ""You've Lost That Loving Feeling"" (have always like The Firm's version of this tune as well), Peter And Gordon's ""I Go To Pieces"" and the(sort of)obscure We Five sole hit ""You Were Always On My Mind"", a lot of oldie fans I've talked with simply don't remember these guys. Recommended."
1,Sitting Duck,"Yall F**KD up! They're not the only ones. Amaturish effort from a fledgling underground Rap quartet. I hate to rag on the newbies but this release is better made into a frisbee. I bought this disk expecting another band by the same name. After I listened to ten minutes of this album I felt like snapping it twain like I do all those annoying ""free"" AOL disks that seem to come with everthing. Geno Rome, J-Sun, Lady Don, John Eclipse and the crew should have spent a whole lot more time thinking this one through. The mixing sounds like it was done on one of those old casio keyboards with the built-in scratch pad. I believe they were called rapmasters or somthing else corney. Rapmasters these guys arent. Buy this disk only if you have run out of coasters. Plan B join Icy Blu, Jesse Jaymes, Snow, and Vanilla Ice as most likely to fail. Save your money and buy a roll of Charmin."
1,not good for a beginner,"i was a beginner when i bought this book for a quarter at a charity book sale.. i was glad it only cost a quarter, because that's all its worth for a beginner in assembly programming.. its just not explained in a good manner like the other books out there.."
5,nuzhatjunaid@hotmail.com,An excellent book on it's subject. I believe the book should be bought only if u have a basic understanding of assembly and microprocessors.
2,"Lack of significant evidence from the ""experts""","I bought this book from the so-called ""experts"" expecting to learn a lot of scientific evidence and support for evolution and natural selection, having a scientific education myself. Instead the text was quite vague, generalized, and full of unproven rhetoric which the authors claimed was fully scientific. Ironically, despite the authors' claim of knowledge of the scientific method, their work provided me with very little genuine scientific evidence of evolution."
1,unhappy,This is another Barney DVD that has no menu. Once you put it on you must fast forward through the initial advertisements and then you can play the Barney portion. Without a menu it is basically a glorified VHS tape that the best you can do is fast forward to get to a certain spot. There is also no spanish sound track. If you want a VHS-like product that should last longer than a tape you might be interested in this. As far as the story goes I would opt for The Night Before Christmas. That story is more little kid friendly and more entertaining. The Christmas Star didn't hold the interest of my 3.5 or 1.5 y/o children. With The Night Before Christmas they request to see it all the time. The Night Before Christmas DVD also functions like a DVD.
3,"Stick to ""Night Before Christmas"" instead!","I got this movie from a friend and was glad I didn't buy it myself. It is kind of boring and not nearly as good as ""Barney's Night Before Christmas"". If you are looking for a video that talks about other holidays besides Christmas, keep looking. In this video, Barney and friends sing a Hanakuh song and a Kwanza song and show a festive table for each holiday, but they do not explain anything about those holidays. The songs last 2-3 minutes and then its back to the Christmas celebration. Some of the Christmas/winter songs in the video are well done, but the search for the star in the attic takes too long and has too much dialouge. Although, my 2 1/2 year-old twins do like the nutcracker drummer scene and the ballerina scene."
4,My first Amazon review! I must be really bored...,"I just began using my new mouse a few minutes ago, and I love it already. I love that it matches my iBook and it's very smooth. The cord is a good length and the scrolly thing is very smooth. I feel like it is a bit small for my hand, and I have pretty small hands, but I'm sure I'll get used to it the more I use it. The size is really the only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. It's a nice notebook sized mouse, but it's just a BIT too tiny."
4,Great Chair but beware!,"This chair is a great alternative to the big and bulky chairs it is light and easily fits in a trunk. The thing you have to be careful with is rolling over transition curbs, the little wheels will stop and throw the occupant out of the chair. You need to be aware of this everytime you roll over nub type bumps. Its better to pull the chair backwards over these. If you take care to remember this can happen this is a great chair."
4,Very useful,"I bought this chair to allow me to take my mother for longer excursions than she is able to walk; I keep it folded up and pull it alongside as we walk, until she gets tired. It is indeed light and easy to fold and unfold. With a little practice, the back can be folded inward, which reduces the bulk of the folded chair. When folded, the footrests swing freely, which can be a problem, so I secure them with a short bungee cord, which I keep in the pocket on the back of the chair. I can step on metal tabs by the rear axles to tilt the chair up, so it can get over small bumps, but this would not allow me to get the chair over a curb."
4,The Wonderfull Chair,"The Chair is easy to fold in for storage and fold out for use. It folds quite small for storage in the car trunk and or the back seat. It is very light as advertised. The chair is worth every penny we paid. The only draw back is that I would have prefered a seat with a smaller width. I'm 5'1"" tall and 150 lbs. The only other item is the small wheels which makes it a little more difficult to navigate over curbs or cracks in the pavement."
5,"Riley (aka - ""His Flying Loafness"")","This is a finely crafted disc. Shiny on one side, elegantly illustrated on the other. Nice little hole in the center, and a perfect diameter. What more can I say. Meeeeow.Oh, yeah, it SOUNDS great too! Fine material, well performed, and cleanly recorded and mastered. Andy and Mark's guitars inspire. Mike's keys fascinate. Mark's vocal sports grit, passion, and polish. Meghan and Mike's vocals elevate their respective tracks. The fine complement of drummers and bassists continues to amaze, and Mr. Mystery Harmonica Man is pretty damn alright as well.This disc is a really fine listen. or in my case, five listens and counting.Buy this record!Meeeeeeow!"
1,full of misconceptions,author writes as if the dice has eyes and a brain .pg. 190 corner shooting\ ;shooters who constantly toss the dice for the corners or aparticular corner have the rarest of rare hot streaks.;;pg. 179 ;i always avoid shooters tossing the dice at an angle into the corners''.pg. 21 ''don't try to out smart the dice. pg.121 dice have no memory' every toss or roll of the diceis completely independent of any previous toss of the dice''. i agree with pg 121 does the author?
5,Awesome book,Actually I may be a little biased on this book. My grandmother wrote it. It is a very nice poem book though. I remember her telling me about how some of the poems alluded to my father and his youth.
2,Returned Item,This product had to be returned because it did not fit nor did it solve the problem for which it was ordered. The company was honest and credited our account. I would deal with them again.
1,"A tiny, very light object","Four step directions. I could not even get the thing to extend far enough to do anything but perch on the bridge of my nose. I am not usually a complete idiot, but nothing in the directions made it possible for me to comfortably place this thing over my eyes, nor was I able EVER to get the distance changer to change at all. Whatever it was will remain a mystery, as I broke down and paid the postage to send this thing back. Honestly, it is so small, it seems more appropriate for a chld, maybe. But I couldn't find one to test it on."
3,good,"This book reads like something that was quickly banged off the type-writer while the author was waiting for his agent to get him a job...which is actually one of its strong points, as well as its weakness. It's a slight book, but that also is why it is so highly readable, as though a smart and funny buddy were telling you some anecdotes over some beers. It gives inside insight into the machinations of the L.A./Show Biz world. It is funny. And you can feel in the subtext that the writer is DESPERATE that he have a success soon, or, God forbid, he's going to have to go work for an advertising agency. This tension ads to the book, too."
4,Sew todays fashions,I was looking for patterns for doll cloths so I could make grand children doll cloths this worked out great
5,Very informative and not antagonistic with facts.,This book opens another avenue to explore African Egypt. Poe establishes genuine facts and points to logical non-antagonistic conclusions making it easy to see Egypt and Africa in the same breath.
3,Oh Lighten Up,"I was expecting to be annoyed by Richard Poe's book, thought it would be a cheap attempt to capitalize on the ""Black Athena"" controversy (hey, controversy sells books). And in a way I was right but it's a good book. ..."
1,More of the same...,"It is most unfortunate that a work such as Mr. Poe's should be misidentified as a serious effort at scholarship, when in fact it is little more than a thinly disguised polemic. Mr Poe's intention is to advance a political agenda rather than provide true historical insight. What is worse, is that those readers who find little of use in BLACK SPARK, WHITE FIRE should be labeled racist for expressing an opinion on a book of questionable worth as history. Let us look at the book, and not defame those who have labored to read Mr. Poe's offering."
2,Where are the RED ones?!!!?? Red gets 5 stars,"The older red and yellow Tuffy pads were FANTASTIC - 5 stars forever. These blue ones look like a blob of toxic slime, and are flimsier. Please bring back the old Tuffy!"
2,Unreliable,"The Pres sound great on this thing. That said, it's unusable as an audio interface. Sound drops out, lots of glitches and flakiness. I bought it used, so thought I may have bought it broken, but come to find out this is just a result of Mackie's disappointing technical support. I am using OS X and have these issues, but there are many others on Windows as well ([...])... Mackie has yet responded to my inquiries. Now I'm stuck with it because unlike the person I got it from, I wouldn't want to sell this to some unassuming person. So I'm just using it as a 10 channel mixer with 4 onyx pres so my wounded pride can at least feel like I'm getting something out of it... I will personally avoid Mackie products from this point out, and I'd warn you to avoid picking up one of these."
3,Still some bugs.,"The sound quality is good, considering the price and the number of channels, but the control room volume pot went out after only a couple of years. For something this expensive, I would expect better build quality."
5,Milton means quality,"When it comes to air tools , You can't beat a American made Milton coupling. The weight of the coupling and size of the locking device tells you its quality, Every product using an air connection can benefit from using a Milton connector --"
2,dont like it,"the package looks like it was produced a long time ago, and the noodle has a weird smell. after boiling it, the water went sour. it is nothing like the chinese noodle i used to have and i would never purchase this noodle again."
4,Rose band chinese egg noodles,I use to use Mission Manchu chinese egg noodles but have been unable to find them for a long period of time and while searching for something comparable I found the Rose brand on Amazon and they are very good. They are very close to the Manchu noodles that my family enjoyed for years.
1,NOT ONE HIT WONDERS,ALOT OF THESE GROUPS HAD ANOTHER HIT OR TWO. ITS INACCURATE AND ITS A COVER ALBUM AS WELL.
3,Man I miss TWR,"Man I miss Thin White Rope. This Mummydogs CD has it's good parts but it gets nowhere near Kysers earlier work. Timeless classics like Red Sun, Moonhead, Down In the Desert, Triangle Song, Americana/The Ghost, Disney Girl, The Ruby Sea, Tina And Glen and.. and.. and.. the list goes on is still how I want to remember Guy Kyser. I still remember Roskilde Festival 1992. Denmark had just played a soccer match in the European Championship (which we won)and Thin White Rope were on in the Blue tent right after the match ended (this was their final 1992 farewell tour of Europe)the crowd was cheering and a very humble Guy Kyser said ""I know you're cheering for Denmark"". No Guy we were cheering for you and your band Thin White Rope and we still miss you."
4,"short, but beautifull","No voice on this album, just his great piano playing, and some additional whisteling. The album is hauntingly beautifull, but terribly short - it only lasts about 20 minutes. It's a kind of Brad Mehldau meets minimalism album; it might sound very simplistic, it still is beautifull enough to blow you away. If it would be a bit longer, it would be a five star album for sure."
1,desilusionado,la verdad pense encontrarme con mejor imagen de la que vi tanto en la primera como en la segunda parte... parece que lo hubieran bajado de internet y tiene muy mala calidad para el precio que tiene.
3,Half Great and Half Not,"About half of these songs were great. It has good pop and R&B songs. The other half was bad remixes. The artists include Backstreet Boys, Sparkle and R Kelley, All Saints, Steps, Cleopatra, and Aqua."
3,An okay game...but not for the hardcore gamer,"The game does have great graphics and has a fun hack-and-slash style, but the game is beyond easy. I've only played the demo so far, but from what I played, it wasn't much. The light campaign's first level took me five minutes to beat on the hardest difficulty. Then I played the dark campaign. This was slightly harder and took me 15 minutes, still not much. The only reason it took so long was because I kept backtracking to get all the gold. The game doesn't offer much of a challenge, and it gets boring after the first time through."
4,Fits well on my mattress,"I didn't have a problem with fit either. In fact, the elastic that goes all the way around the sheet makes for a snug fit and gives me piece of mind that the sheet won't snap off. The sheet itself is soft, much more so than the regular cotton sheets. My only complaint is that it seems like it may stain easily. I've washed mine only once and there looks like there is a small stain. I could be wrong since I have a dark blue sheet...it just may be where some color bled out a little. Overall, this sheet is a great buy at a low price."
2,You can do without it,"The book is by an ex collegue of Jose Silva and mind you its likea compendum of what this collegue could gather from Silva. If you are a newcomer to ESP aqnd Mind Control then you may like this, if not then there are better books available online worth their money.The text starts with stories on how ESP works but th exercises will not help you much. I have read many ESP books and this one ... Definately not worth its price...."
3,"Repetitive, course-promoting, sub-par writing","I found this book somewhat badly written and also quite repetitive. Particularly repetitive was the constant referral back to the Silva courses. It was made perfectly clear, often, that the courses were far better than the information received in the book. It reminded me of the way Joseph Murphy (author of, among others, Telepsychics) constantly footnotes, with all said footnotes referring to other books only MURPHY has written. It can be annoying, and the same can be said when reading this book.While there's good information here, I should have just ordered something Silva himself had written."
3,Misled on This One,"Actually I liked the title track very much. My smooth jazz station in Santa Barbara played it while I was on the road. I usually listen to my station while I unwind on the commute home. I called the DJ who also like the title track and said the CD was pretty good. The first review here gave me doubts - but I bought it anyway. I am not a fan of VERY mellow lounge jazz. I prefer faster rhythm jazz that is more in step with flying down the highway at 65mph. When I listen to slower jazz, it has to have a seductive molodic thread throughout the number. There is no tune that matches the title track here. However, I found that all the ODD tracks were fairly good. All the EVEN tracks were intolerably slow sleepy efforts that would be an excellent cure for insomnia. I programmed my work PC for the odd tracks and found it enjoyable. However, 50% on a CD cannot rate more than 3 stars with me. Warning! Listening to the even tracks at work may cause you to doze-off on the job."
2,Really,"This is a story of a young man who is struggling with life. The main theme is of an atheist being converted to christianity. From the beginning to the end, this movie was made to show that a person is empty without having an imagary friend to believe in. It is pure evangelical propaganda. If your a person of fath you may like this movie. If your an atheist like myself this movie is hard to invest any time in."
2,quantites are misleading,even though the product is excellentit says 300 capsules when in fact they sell and ship only 100 capsulesbe careful not to fall in this trap......
4,Solid album,"A nice start to a good line of music. Listening to this album blows me away. It's so amazing the themes in Suffering's music (not just the Thieves), so diverse. The music, also, it blows me away to hear the beautiful orchestrations and Jeff singing quite nicely out of key. Very adventerous and bold."
5,Paintball gun ROCKS....,Great fun.....this gun rocks the field....my son love it he has used it several times without any problems.Recommend this purchase to anyone...
4,"kipper is a preschool favorite, simple and funny","kipper does lots of things that apply to the everyday life of toddlers and preschool aged kids. my son is 3.5 and he loves this dvd. the dvd contain several small episodes and the character are polite and helpful and will help your child learn proper manners. characters in kipper videos have an english or brittish accent, yet are easy to understand."
5,My son loves this show,"My son loves Kipper the Dog so much that when we got a puppy, he was named Tiger (because he looks like Kipper's sidekick, Tiger). I like the show because they (the dogs) engage in imaginative play and activities which inspire my son."
4,Where can i download the drumming cd?,So far the book is great. I just wish i had the drumming cd/mp3 that comes with the book. Anyone know where i can get it?
3,Not bad.,"Sandra Ingerman embraces Harner's shamanic idea of a lower, middle and upper world (not a surprise for she is one of Harner's students). I have no problem with that. However this book could be entitled ""Shamanism: over-simplification made easy"". It may be used to explain shamanism to 5th graders. If this is what you want, the book is good. For beginners I strongly recommend Cowan's ""Shamanism: As a Spiritual Practice for Daily Life"". It's a vastly more complete, yet simple."
3,A little light,"I think the book is a little too light, too introductory for this subject. The best chapter for myself is almost at the ned where she gives a varies groups of subjects to focus the voyages of the young shaman. The hardcover edition is very nice, very high quality, the paper. It also comes with a CD, which is nice for begginers. I was expecting a little more."
1,Kitchenaide Slow Cooker,Don't waste your time. The first bowl cracked but was replaced by Kitchenaide - a clear indication they knew it was defective. The second cracked after fewer than six uses. Save yourself the money and grief and buy another product.
3,WMP???Why would you not support this medium???,"i was very perturbed to find out this did not support WMP as a medium. i didnt research this product properly before i purchased it and thats my bad, i was not happy with how it sounded, it was not very crisp and lost a lot of sound through distortion. i now have the Dual XDM7510 In-Dash CD/MP3/WMA Receiver and it put this one in the dust, the same 220 watt but this one sounds sooo much better! way crisper, cleaner sound, doesnt sound like i installed an old record player. the flip face is cute though..."
4,GREAT HEAD UNIT FOR THE PRICE,"The only reason I give theis unit a 4 star rating is because DUAL's customer service is, at best, terrible. It took me almost 2 hours of explanation, poking, prodding, and some begging to get the unit replaced when it did fail. The first unit lasted about 8 months (still in warranty) before it failed. When I finally did get a replacement, it has lasted three years and some change. It still works, but the face will not come down any more. For the original $160 or so that I spent for it, it was well worth the money. I love the display. It isn't as high tech as some, but very user friendly."
1,P-touch power awdapter,The service getting it here was great. It broke about a week after I got it. The product sucks!!!!!!
1,Thought I would save money,"I bought this to save money on batteries, only it doesnt work all the time, so I ended up having use batteries anyway now."
1,no healthy trace minerals,"It contains several toxic heavy metals: Mercury, Cadmium, Arsenic, Aluminum and Lead. Mercury acts as a neurotoxin, interfering with the brain and nervous system. Aluminum has been associated with Alzheimers. Cadmium and Arsenic with cancer. Recent scientific studies on lead show that adverse health effects are occurring at lower levels of exposure to lead than previously thought. At low levels of exposure to lead, the main health effect observed the nervous system; specifically, exposure to lead may have subtle effects on the intellectual development of infants and children."
3,Not using for trimming hair,This works for what we needed it for but am not using it to trim hair. Using it to trim embroidery threads.
2,Lasted less than 1 year,"The battery worked great in the beginning, but after less than 1 year, it will only hold 40% charge which lasts less than 1 hour."
3,Disappointing,"The story goes the studio tape recorder used to record this album, was also the one to nearly destroy it. Hence the title, ""recovered"". I find it really really hard to find redeeming songs on this comp. Nothing on it really fits in with ""Peace"", ""Hope"", ""Worth"", or ""elektrodelica"". the tracks are sort of moody and dark, maybe 2 are catchy, but mostly are just rough sketches of tossed-away song ideas. But it's still a nice trip back with the 'old' gang, and their now 'old' sound. (i.e. guitarless)."
3,Slightly disappointed loyal fan,"I am a diehard Anything Box fan who has had to search long and hard to buy all of their albums from obscure record labels. The cd states that they wanted to have a ""more Kraftwerkian sound, simple, basic."" This is exactly what you get. While all of their other cd's have disappeared, i'd wouldn't want to see this CD stand alone to represent an incredible Synthpop band. The die-hard A-Box fans, like myself, will undoubtedly buy the cd and I'm sure they will find enough songs to justify the cheap price. Casual listeners may not be as impressed."
2,Too Repetitive,I kept falling asleep reading this book. He keeps repeating the same thing paragraph after paragraph. I found His Needs Her Needs to be a much better book.
4,The cooking detective triumphs again,"Another entertaining episode featuring French Chef and reluctant detective Auguste Didier. Threats are being made against the life of music hall star William Lamb, and Auguste is persuaded to take a job as cook at the theatre's eating-house, in order to keep an ey on Lamb. Unfortunately, he can't prevent Lamb's murder, which seems to be linked to the dissapearance of a treasure from Windsor Castle. Enter Inspector Rose of Scotland Yard to try and sort it out. Amusing characters and convincing period detail makes this book an enjoyable read, as the professional detective and the reluctant amateur join forces once again."
4,A classic revisited,The Jeffersons debuted in 1975 reflecting vast change for African-Americans in this country. TV fans would now see images of black people who started poor but worked their way to success. We were also exposed to one of TV's first interracial couples. All of this was created with comedic dazzle courtesy of Norman Lear.
5,This is what you've been missing,"I saw Todd Snider live at an old movie theatre in Nashville. He blew me away. I was disappointed in his last couple of albums. They seemed to have lost the satiric edge of ""Daily Planet"". That edge is back here, with more raw emotions and descriptive story-telling. Tom Petty and John Prine with maybe just a touch of Buffet.If you like Daily Planet and have been wondering what happened to that guy, he's back on Happy to be here."
4,Todd Snider - Back To His Roots,"Snider was dropped from his major label contract after his previous disc ""Viva Satellite"" in 1998. He signed with John Prine's Oh Boy label for this one and it really was the perfect place for Snider. Snider had opened for Prine many times in the past and there are certainly a lot of similarities to their songwriting. This album leans a lot closer to the country direction than his previous two discs, it is also largely acoustic in nature, with a few rockers (still with acoustic guitar out front) thrown in as well. Snider seems to be getting back to his roots with this release after the more commercial rock direction of his previous effort. For the most part it works and this is another nice album from Mr. Snider."
2,Where's the 16:9 anamorphic version MGM?,I watched OL religiously on Showtime. Towards the end of the series the episodes were broadcast in 16:9 HDTV. I have not yet bought this DVD but I'm troubled that the format is 4:3 rather than 16:9. I'm hoping that future OL DVD's will offer a 16:9 version.
3,"Great videos, but...what SO FEW?","ABC made some really campy, great fun videos and most of them are here, but WHY only include FIVE paltry videos when you can fit so much MORE on one DVD? It's clearly a ploy to get ABC fans to shell out more money for the SAME FIVE VIDEOS you can also get on the more comprehensive ABSOLUTELY ABC DVD - One plus here is the videos are presented in their ENTIRETY without the annoying ""title cards"" marring edits - for $5 clams it ain't bad."
1,Ribbon & Wrap Organizer,"The organizer was ok, it just appeared cheap looking and unfortunately is too large for a closet door."
1,Big piece of junk!!!,"I was looking forward to organizing my laundry room and wrapping paper for the upcoming holidays. I opened the box and half of the unit was covered in brown oil and the dowels were also covered in brown stuff and warped. I can't believe anybody could even send this off to someone and think they could use it!!! I comtemplated painting it, buying new dowels and my husband was completely adimate I send it back to you or throw it away. What went wrong????"
2,\/ Objective Review \/,"So I'm reviewing this CD as an objective listener. I listen to mostly west coast rap. I DJ too. So I've heard a lot. This CD is no more than bubblegum. DJ Clue? Fabolous? So there ya go. This guys the Fabolous of the west coast...in fact ill bet if you read transcripts of their lyrics without hearing the songs you wouldnt be able to tell them apart.I dislike it when people who are popular in NY get their whole region on their backs. Like TI. TI isnt the king of the south hes the NY king of the south. And shade sheist is just another MC out of 100 brought to you by Artist and Repertoire. He claims a lot to be the new west coast but like i said, hes the NY new west coast. To be honest tho, this guy could be great...his flows are pretty good and the beats is aiight. But if he had some good cali beats and the freedom to write whatever he wants it would be a lot better."
2,It wasn't that good,"I think that the idea about Alphas and Omegas is to fake to belive.The Alphas are supposed to be the kid's parents and the Omegas the enemies.Yeah ,right.That seems sooooo fake.If the book were about finding the inventor of the Omegas only it would be really good.But The Alphas and Omegas fighting to destroy each other is not the best idea for a fiction book."
2,Scratched wood floors,"I have had nothing but trouble with my iRobot Roomba. When I ran it on my wood floors, it made scratches all over the wood floor's finish. In addition, I have sent back my roomba now twice now, because the brushes stopped working. It is a neat toy, but would not recommend it to actually vacuum the floors. Definitely keep it off wood floors; it was a very expensive lesson at my expense... iRobot would not pay for the repairs."
2,Not duarble - will fail,"A clever machine when it works. Mine began failing after a year and totally failed after two years. Spend less time trying to figure out what's wrong with it, buy a regular vacuum cleaner and just vacuum the floor a couple of times a week. Given the technology that goes into this product, iRobot should stand behind it with a 5-year warranty."
4,Time Will Tell,"I enjoyed Time Will Tell and recommend it to others. Its an enjoyable book which relates incidents in the past to current events. Thomasine, Rachel and Hope could be you or your friends. In spite of their differences and conflicts they remain steadfast friends. Many of the events in their lives mirror events which many women have faced. This book is a keeper and I look forward to a sequel. Trevy McDonald has captured the essence and spirit of womanhood in each of her characters. Its not hard for any reader to relate to one or more of the characters and to share in their dreams and heartbreaks. Each woman brings something to the table of friendship which makes their friendship last despite distance or differances. Each is made stronger by hardship and mistakes. Together they weather the storms of life.Thumbs up Trevy! I look forward to more of your works."
2,stereotypes and problems,"Another one for the ""bad femdom"" category. Here we find stereotype after stereotype, or worse perhaps, a series of women who do ""BDSM"" for less than beautiful reasons. Perhaps I'm an idealist, perhaps I only like things that resemble what my own fantasies are, but I can't say that any of these stories made a positive impression on me."
2,Loss of sustain,"No signal interruptions (which is a good thing), but there is A LOT of an annoying loss of sustain. I play mainly classic hard rock songs and I really felt a lack of a more consistent sound. I'll try to compensate it with a compressor pedal before the pedalboard, but I dont know if it will be effective. If it don't works, I'll try to sell the product (warning about the sustain issue, surely).Don't ask me why, but when I was looking for reviews in order to decide what wireless system to buy, i found very good ones for this product. But just when I got and tested it, I returned to google adding the word SUSTAIN to the search and finally found a lot of bad reviews, all them reporting this terrible issue.So, here's another bad review :/"
2,why!?!?!,why would someone make a huge bag of unnecessary candy.I love candy and all but sometimes too much is too much!
3,Quartet cork bulletin board,"The bulletin board serves its purpose. The only issue which is mentioned in other reviews is that the board has a tendency to not come in 100% condition. Mine was not completely broken (for if it were I would have returned it), but rather mine did come with a crack in the back. Either, the bulletin board is not made too well or else amazon has a problem in shipping the item since it has a tendency to crack. I have about a 2 to 3 inch crack in the back that does not go all the way through and thus I kept is and make sure to be very careful when handling."
1,Identical to Ki in Aikido : A Sampler of Ki Exercises,The book itself is good. I just think it was to similar to Ki in Aikido : A Sampler of Ki Exercises by the same people... The book was Identical word for word in some parts... I felt ripped off...
1,Somebody's Heart Is burning: A Woman Wanderer in Africa,I found this book poorly written and a boring read.
3,Not as good as the original German ones,"While the price is good and service is good as usual with Amazon, the best quality real Haribo gummies are all German. I hope Amazon brings the real ones here even if they charge more for it."
2,STILL in need of a remaster,"The official reissue FINALLY sees the song 'Centurian War Games' added to the Invasion disc: a track that was cut from the bootleg version which has both ""Invasion"" and ""Metal"" on one CD. My BIGGEST complaint with this ""re-issue:"" The vinyl noise is there in horrid full force... And this is supposed to be remastered? I sincerely hope this isn't the final product... The songs are decent, essential for Manilla Road fans, but to be honest, the downloads out there from the older days have better quality, due to the fact there isn't nearly as much vinyl noise... Someone needs to remaster these PROPERLY, as Cult Metal Classics didn't do their homework..."
4,Big Bling,This ring is pretty nice. Its very flashy and very big. if you wanna make heads turn then I think this is the ring for you. People will be complimenting on it all night.
4,Wilderness Love,A GOOD movie for all the family. Kids try to reunite their parents. Highly recommend this film for all ages.
2,Not my idea of a family movie.,"I hadn't seen this movie, but I bought it on the strength of repeated reviews calling it a good family movie. I've learned my lesson. Call me old-fashioned, but when a couple that has been divorced for two years ends up in bed together, that isn't my idea of family values, even if when their children discover them they all get a good laugh out of it. The mother's advice to her barely 16-yr. old daughter about sex left a lot to be desired, too. Basically she gives her daughter a green light as long as she thinks she is in love first. It could have been a nice family show, and if the things I've mentioned don't bother you, then you may enjoy it. Performances are good and the story line is interesting, though a bit confusing at first. But if you are a ""prude"" like me, steer clear."
5,"Great, clean show","Our family loves this show - nothing inappropriate or vulgar. Entertaining and light, yet hopeful about the triumph of true love and marriage."
2,It SHRINKS,I washed my sheet in cold water and dried it on low heat and it shrunk. It was extremely difficult to get the sheet onto the crib.
3,Rough sheets that shrink,"I bought these sheets to match our daughter's bedding. The color is very pretty and does not fade. However, the sheets shrink which make for a hard fit, and they are not soft even with lots of Downey and several washings. I would not recommend these sheets."
1,Only If You Are a Die-Hard Fan,"I loved the 1960's movie, and have seen it countless times. It was interesting to get some behind-the-scenes stories and find out how they were made and what became of the movie props, but that was the majority of this. There were a couple of low video quality scenes which probably served more as a reunion for the actors than in telling a continuation of the Time Machine story. Otherwise it was mostly people involved in the original film telling of their experiences in making it. If you are a die-hard fan then you might enjoy this, and if it was free I'd say go ahead and watch it, but I'm sorry I spent the price of a Coke and the 45 minutes on it."
5,Wonderful doc...and mini sequel to The Time Machine,This is a wonderful tribute to George Pal's The Time Machine. Rod Taylor is great as the host and returns as George The Time Traveller. Reuniting him with Alan Young. It's also the last acting performance of Whit Bissell. Written by David Duncan. I loved it!!
1,"Rip-off alert, not what it claims to be...","This book's claim for the CD is dishonest! The book is simply a compilation of sample ads with the claim that they are on the CD ready for your use, but THIS IS NOT TRUE. The cd has only a few lines of text for each ad, NOT the graphics or professionally designed material printed in the book and to be expected from the books self-promotion. Since the book advertises itself as a ready-to-use resource this is dishonest! As for instructional content it is limited to the first 3 pages which you can already see in the ""look inside"" feature. Buyers would be better served by any college marketing text or by browsing the phone book. Save your money !"
5,Very comfortable bed. Happy with it.,"I like this mattress. It's very comfortable. We slept like babies in our camping tent. We woke up around 9am even though there was noise of kids playing around the campground at 7am. It loses a bit of air every day you sleep on it, but not enough air to make you feel uncomfortable. I put air every night before bed time. I used it for camping twice, 3 night each camping. The pump could be a little tricky so make sure to read the directions and practice at home if you're using it for camping. We open it at the campground the first time. After setting up our tents, kitchen, etc. my husband was to tired to read the instruction so, he couldn't get enough air in the bed. The second time he read the instructions carefully and got it to work fine. Worth every penny."
4,Prestige Downy Twin Airbed,This mattress is only used when my grandsons come to visit. My only disappointment is the amount of batteries needed for it. Wish the pump was electric.
2,Be aware of the pump issues,"I read one customer review saying the pump didn't work. I didn't take it seriously and still ordered it. Eventually I received a defective pump as well.Also, be aware of the pump needs 6-C batteries. Depending on which brand of the battery you will buy, this may cost you a fortune compared to the value of the air bed itself. If you have a pump already, then you should pass this item.I don't quite like the smell either. I can feel a strong plastic smell especially the first night I was trying to use it."
5,This one last the most from dozens I tried,I have a back problem so I need to sleep on air rather than regular mattress so that I can adjust the firmness.It is amazing how most mattresses don't last very long (a few weeks at the most). It is because newer mattress design (oval-like pattern) tears very quickly. This mattress design has long strips and that always seem to last long.It lasted for over 1 year of daily use until yesterday when my daughter keep jumping on it and eventually she broke it (now it very slowly leaks).I am ordering it again and my daughter is grounded =)
2,Isn't the greatest,"Sucks for holding air. My girl weighs 140 and I weigh 220 I guess thats too much on a 60 degree night, we woke up in the morning to a half inflated bed, lame."
4,Well priced camping or emergency inflatable mattress,Bought two of these to go camping and they did everything they should have. Inflation time is about 15 minutes and we slept great. Deflation was simple and quick.Recommend!
4,air mattress for kids,"These air mattresses are very nice. The material is strong and after having used them multiple times since I have bought them, it hasn't deflated once!! The mattress seems to stop filling with air when it is inflated with the proper amount. I bought 2 of these. One for each of my children. They slept well and never ""hit the ground"". I would highly recommend this mattress. As for longevity, we will see........."
3,Better than sleeping on the floor!,"I ordered two of these air mattresses to fit into a tent I purchased to go camping with my 8 year old son. They just fit into the tent and were a little cumbersome, but the blower provided blew them up in minutes and they were better than sleeping on the floor! I somehow managed to kick the plug in the middle of the night and it deflated rather quickly I unfortunately found out and I didn't want to wake up the camp at 4 AM so make sure it's in tight before you try to go to sleep!"
2,Quality of mattress was fine but....,Within 4 hours the air had escaped and no attempts to revive it would help.I ended up throwing it away.
3,good value,"Works just fine for a basic airbed. Nice that is comes with a pump, but 6 batteries makes it a bit bulky. Still a good value for the price"
1,Piece of crap,"I opened the package and the directions for the pump are so complicated! Then I had to buy C batteries.Finally I bought the batteries and got my hired Masters degree to understand the directions. Didn't work!Thought maybe the batteries were bad, bought six more. Still no power. Piece of crap. I bought this because my grandson often sleeps over and thought it would be a great option. My poor grandson had no place to sleep."
3,Worked Well for awhile,"bought the product based on the notion that other reviewers said it stood the test of teenagers. We used it for an 18 year old athlete who spends so much time on the court he has to sleep there. It worked perfectly, until it got a hole, maybe a month or two after buying it. Not pleases. If yours doesn't hole up and you know how to work the pump and hole trickery you should be fine."
2,Doesn't hold air,"I own an Intex raised downy queen sized bed and am quite happy with it - it holds air pretty well throughout the night. The Intex Prestige Downy, however, is nowhere near as good. 70% of the air leaks out in the first three hours, and you have to repump. Do not buy this bed."
5,Easy to use,Great economical solution for a travel bed. Easy to use and seems very durable. No issues with the product at all.
4,Just what I needed...,"Nice firm mattress, seems to be built good, no problems so far....gave it 4 stars because the pump it came with needed 6 C batteries and it would've been nice in the description if they made that clear so your not surprised when you get it."
1,Worked for a few days then failed miserably,"This air mattress was great. Until the layering inside became twisted. Now there is a large ""hump"" in the center of the mattress. It is nearly impossible to sleep on. After a quick email to Intex explaining that the mattress received no abuse but appeared to just twist on its own I received an email back saying ""sorry"" and ""nothing can be done."" Way to sell a shoddy air mattress. I would suggest buying a different brand. One without separate inner tubes."
1,Ruined,"We only used one time and thereafter it won't stay full. It is a total nightmare. In addition, if it has a hole, we can't find it and no patch to fix it if we could find it. So sorry we bought this from Amazon."
3,Not comfy,"Right from the start of laying on this air bed I can feel pain in my lower back where I hurt it last year, I need it for the weekend so I guess it's just something I will have to deal with. If you have a bad back perhaps think about maybe buying a top for it."
5,THE REAL THING,"THIS ITEM WAS GENUIN A I AM HAPPY,I BOUGHT THIS ITEM FROM SOME WERE ELSE AND IT WAS WATERED DOWN,I CAN TELL BECAUSE THE SMELL DID NOT LAST LONG AT ALL.I ORDERED FROM THIS SELLER AND NOT ONLY WAS IT THE REAL THING,IT WAS AT A GOOD PRICE.I WILL ORDER FROM THIS SELLER AGAIN AND TELL MY FRIENDS ABOUT THE SELLER."
2,Don't use with a Canon S3,"This lens does not work well with a Canon S3 IS. Only a very small area in the center of field is in focus, bluring heavily toward the edges. There is also severe color fringing. I understand that this lens is great on many cameras, but the S3 is not one of them."
5,Keychain Life Hammer,Excellent product but do NOT test on girl friend's glass table (even after placing 5+ napkins to protect the top).
5,Perfect little tool.,After purchasing this tool I had the chance to use it in an emergency situation while working. It performed flawlessly jn both breaking the car window and cutting seatbelt. Every emergency worker should have one !
1,ResQMe Keychain,"Very hard to use item. So difficult that I returned it. Looked great in demonstration but not comsumer-friendly. May be ok for strong people but, in an emergency, no one needs something that's not dependable and easy."
5,good stuff,Nice yellow escaping tool. Good quality. Haven't got the chance to try the window breaking yet. But tried on the carton and saw the dent.Amazon Shipping was fast. Good price too.
5,EVERYONE SHOULD HAVE ONE,Best tool for under 10 bucks. Works like it is supposed to and you will be prepared if you encounter an emergency situation.
1,Test Them!,"Imagine giving this device to your 16 year old. Imagine he encounters circumstances to put it to use. Now imagine it fails to work. How would you feel about your gift?I ordered 6 of these as Christmas stocking-stuffers. Fortunately, my 16 year old tested the glass breaking function of his on a piece of scrap hard plastic.No matter how hard we tried we couldn't get the pin to 'pop'. The barrel simply moved in and out with no effect.I handed him another. The pin popped as it should but then remained stuck in the extended position. In actual use that would have meant one try to break the glass and then the device would have been useless.I tested the remaining 4 and they did, in fact, function as advertised and demonstrated. I don't think a device like this ought to have what basically amounts to a 33% failure rate on the 6 I purchased.If you buy them, TEST them. Then consider installing the full-sized hammer as a back-up."
4,Safety Device,"Recieved the Keychain Version of the Original LifeHammer (Royal Blue), Pack of 2 in a timely manner and tested one to see if it works, it works as decribed in the information given on the website."
4,Never used the escape tool.,"Dont know how well the thing functions, but i like it for just in case type situation. hardly noticeable on my keychain."
2,Shame on Oxford Garden!,"Shame on Oxford Garden for cheapening their product! I ordered 2 of these chaise cushions. One was 3.5"" thick but the other was 2"" thick! The 2"" thick model also collects water where the back and base meet. My cushion is still wet in this area from a rainstorm 36 hours ago. The other cushion was dry within half a day.In addition to the thinner size, the stitches are off in certain areas."
1,Not the fantasy author!,"I thought I was buying a fantasy book, and so was sorely disappointed. Also, wife beating seems acceptable. This has nothing to do with Pern or dragons, and I am convinced written by a different author with the same name. Deceptive."
2,broken on the first day,"My Roomba failed on the first day! I am hugely disappointed.I bought a Roomba with great enthusiasm. It arrived on December 22. On December 23, I gave it a try. My kids were greatly impressed by the little robot. It cleaned carpet area without too much a problem, only stuck under a chair once. Then I took it to the basement. Roomba had great difficulties at the boundary of two uneven surfaces. It spent extra time and often stuck there. It also had problem with bathroom rugs, always sucking up the rug and dragging it behind. Then in the middle of a run, one of the wheels stopped working and the red light began to flash. That was the end of my Roomba.Roomba is a great concept, but not quite there yet. I look forward to the next generation of Roomba."
1,Died just out of warranty,"I really liked Roomba - at first. However - just three months out of warranty - the little devil gave up the ghost. At first I thought the battery had died, so I ordered a new one. That didn't work and after a call to Roomba I learned that something was wrong internally with the robot and they would be glad to ship me a replacement for $90 - without a battery. In other words, I could get a new one for retail. I told her that since the first one had lasted such a short time I wasn't too anxious to invest in another one. On the plus side - they are allowing me to return the new battery and parts for a refund.I'm sad to see him go - he's really cute - but I'm back to my old tried and true vaccuum that's been humming away for years."
4,sweet,"It's sweet - I run it every week - no fuss, no muss (and no mess). It take a long time to do it's thing but it's better than me doing it!"
1,I wasted my money and way too much time on this thing,"I bought the Roomba Vac. I have all hardwood floors in my house, let me just say this, NOISY. It takes too long to charge in between cleanings, my house is 2000 square feet so we are talking lots of floor to cover. It cannot handle one bedroom without taking minimum two and one half hours to clean. I thought that this would save me time, it didn't. To be honest, I took it back to Target. I can clean my floor faster with a broom and dustpan and not waste time or electricity. My family thanked me because you can now hear again after the noise is gone. Sorry, don't waste your money or time. I hope this helps you to make the right decision."
2,I wish it had lasted,"While the Roomba lasted (just over a year) it was good. It wasn't great, but it was definitely good. It was a little moody and really disliked one specific corner of my kitchen. I miss it and look forward to them updating and improving the machine."
5,roomba rocks,"Fantastic invention--works well. You need to keep it clean so it works well. Warning to women: although it works great all by itself, your guy may feel compelled to WATCH it the first 10 times for the sheer entertainment value."
2,Broke down after 1 week,"We loved it while it worked, but it broke down after 1 week of use. It's cleaning power was better than I expected, and it did a nice job of covering an entire room. It started to malfunction after 1 week and despite several calls to customer service we couldn't get it to work properly.We have been waiting several weeks for a replacement unit, hopefully coming soon..."
2,Great when it works but too many problems,"I used my roomba for about 6 months successfully, it cleaned well and had relatively few issues. After 6 months it would work for 5 minutes and stop with the message 'clean the brushes', I did a complete cleaning and spent $54 on all new brushes and have not been able to get it to work again. Would I spend $350 for 6 months - NO. If it kept working I would have give it a '5' because when it is working it is really an asset but now I am just out $350."
3,Fun but pointless,"I like the Irobot, but it's kind of pointless. Sure it cleans the place, but most likely it will leave a spot unclean. I scattered some hamster litter on my floor to test the irobot. It missed a little bit of the garbage (even after leaving it on for a half hour)"
3,"It works, but doesn't last","We bought our Roomba about three months ago. We were thrilled. Our apartment is so much cleaner now; the hardwood floors shine. It picked up shocking amounts of cat hair, human hair and dust every day. The problem is, it no longer works and their customer service is nonexistent. I'm going to order another one, because when it works, it makes such a difference, but if this one only lasts three months, I guess it will be back to manual vacuuming."
4,Roams my house like a blind little puppy,"The Roomba spends most of its time under the end table next to my sofa. Once in a while, before I leave for work, I get it out and press the large 'Clean' button on top. When I come back, my floors are vacuumed. The Roomba gets its bin emptied of all the cat hair and dust, and back under the table it goes until next time.I have a small condo (1200 sq.ft.) and the Roomba can get it all on one charge. It's about 75% carpet and 25% tile, the Roomba handles both. My cat behaved aggressively towards it at first, but now she ignores it.Not reccommended if you have a large house, the battery life just isn't good enough. It also can't go over rugs, so make sure you put the rugs away first. Bottom line - I hate to vacuum and now I don't have to anymore.I also like to follow the Roomba around with a leather whip and give it a few lashes while it is working. It makes me feel like a big man."
1,save your money,"This Roomba is not worth the money. I've had one for only a few weeks; at first it cleaned well but missed large areas of my living room. Now all of the sudden it constantly shuts off for no reason. Also, seven hours charging time is too long for any device, and I think that having to clean the roller and other parts after every few uses kind of kills the convenience of having a vacuum robot."
5,She Gets 'Em Done!,I have officially named my Roomba Charlaina. She cleans my little area for me and does an impeccable job (besides the edge right about my desk which is so obvious for me to clean anyways). Long live Charlaina! I love you!
5,Wonderful!,"We thought the Roomba was probably one of those gadgets that doesn't really work very well. How wrong we were! This thing goes to work and cleans up everything. It goes under the furniture too! We have 3 cats and a dog, and we run the Roomba almost every day! Our carpet is cleaner than it's ever been! Everyone should have one of these! What a waste of time vacuuming by hand is!"
2,Damaged Product,"I was very pleased when I received the vacuum so quickly. Unfortunatley, there was a rattle when we attempted to open the sealed package. Upon further examination we saw that a few small parts on the front of the vacuum were broken off. When I emailed them to let them know that I would like a replacement, they told me I would only receive a refund.As this was a gift, I was very disappointed in their response."
4,Y,"get 3 of these, 3 RCA couplers, another set of RCA dubbing cables, a AC/DC converter and let the kids play video games in the car on long trips."
2,Too Small,"I have this sheet in pink and it is so tight that I tore the sheet trying to put it on. I use a thin matress pad over a Sealy crib mattress and all my other sheets seem to fit fine. The cotton is nice, but what good is it if it is ripped because it doesn't fit?"
3,Breaks fairly easy- easy for kids to learn,"I am now going to be buying a 3rd one of these gates- the first broke within a couple months when my children pulled it too far open. the second had some damage but lasted longer (over a year). the only reason we use this gate rather than something else is becausse for a 60"" doorway, it is the best price around that does not seem like it would be annoying to open and shut.my 5 year old and 3 year old figured out this gate long ago- but I need it to keep the 18mos old out of my work area.it i easy to use, though, and it has served its purpose.my kids have tried to cllimb it, but it moves a little too much for them to climb it well.it would be better if it had a larger range of motion when it is open- this is how my kids have broken it."
3,"Really good for us, but be aware of some negatives","We have wide opening about 4.5 feet wide and bought the Graco Expansion Swing Gate as the only decent option for a wide opening.Pro:-Really easy install (I did it with only a tape measure and pencil)-Effective* (see negatives for more detail)-Covers a wide opening* (see negatives for more detail)Con:-Make sure that you close the gate properly... the bottom latch is easy to miss-The ""locking latch"" is very small, not an issue for us, but I can see others having trouble-The wider applications open up gaps in the gate that can be used to climb over it-No options to consider to let our cats passBottom line: Not a substitute for supervision. We think you should carefully weigh pros and cons of any gate before making a purchase, and consider more than one style in your home (like we did) to custom taylor your solutions to each situation."
3,Does it job but a bit flimsy at each end.,"I like this because of the height and its ability to expand farther than other gates of its size. However, the hooks on either end are quite flimsy and bend easily if you don't get them into the eye hooks. I still use it but those are my only complaints. I may remove the hooks and replace them with sturdier clips in the future."
5,The best baby gate ever,"I already had one of these gates at the top of our stairs from when our children were small. It's the only one that I could find that was simple enough for my older children to work and expandable to a very wide doorway. I needed a second gate to lock our toy poodle into an area of the house, and too many of the gates were too difficult for the children to manipulate. Some other gates had holes on the edges that the dog was small enough to squeeze through. I couldn't find this anywhere in local stores, so had to buy it online. Love this gate."
1,Not what is in the picture,"I purchased this gate online because the only ones like this I could find locally had the beige plastic top, and I wanted one that was white. This arrived in a box showing the white top, however the bar across the top was beige. NOT HAPPY."
2,Not ready for prime time,"A lot of this material is markedly inferior to his later recordings. Some of it sounds tentative. Many of the songs are in a key that doesn't work for the vocals. Strictly for completists.If you're looking for a first Magic Sam album get ""West Side Soul."""
5,No Doubt meets the beat...,"This release is a remix of No Doubt's song ""Bathwater"" off of their multi platinum 2000 album ""Return of Saturn"". This remix was actually crafted by no doubt guitarist Tom Dumont's side project ""Invincible Overlord"". It is sharp, vibrant, and is great for clubs and dancing. not offered on any no doubt album, this single is a good buy. the video for the song uses outtakes from the original bathwater video. the other remixes for :""it's my life"" are also very well done. 5 stars. i highly reccomend this!"
3,Perry Mason Season 1,"We have only watched the first 3 episodes on disk one. Episode 1 and 3 were fine, 2 was full of lines and snow. If any more are like episode 2 on disk one, we will return it for another copy"
5,Perry Mason Magic,"This DVD is a wonderful collection of early Perry Mason. If you are a fan of Perry Mason then I would recommend you purchase this DVD. It is so nice to watch the TV with no commericals, swearing or nude sceens."
4,Almost as good as it gets,"The transfers were evey bit as fantastic as one could hope for in the realm of DVD. However, I'm getting tired of the new ""double dipping"" that TV DVD has fallen into. Season 1, Volume 1. GIMME A BREAK!!! First Voyage To The Bottom Of The Sea, then The Time Tunnel and now Perry Mason. Quit getting so damn greedy."
5,Excellent!!,"This is a great series, and the DVDs are EXCELLENT. (I have both Vol. 1 and Vol. 2 of the first season.) Please, please hurry and release the rest of the seasons ASAP!!"
4,Good old days,"I watched Perry Mason regularly when it was first aired. It was always a very special program for me. That was a long time ago, but it is still just as entertaining. I'm certainly happy to see it and a number of the older TV programs being offered this way. Our youngsters shouldn't have to miss out on this wholesome type of programing."
5,Call And Response Rips,"This group is vocal, versitile, and very fun. Funky breakbeats, catchy basslines, funtime guitar, and spacey keyboards dominate the sound. Vocal harmonies reminiscent of the wonderful groups of the sixties, like the zombies or the free design."
3,About Sisterlocks,I guess I was looking for more information about sisterlocks.This book just puts on paper what a consultation with a consultant would show you and tell you. I wouldn't recommend this book as a learning tool. The pictures are in black and white so it doesn't allow you to see the beauty of the locs. My suggesstion is if you're thinking of sisterlocks call a consultant and you'll get all the information you'll need. This book just confirms that. Save your money...
5,Good cooking,"Reminds me of home cooking, as in the home i grew up in in England, time to start experimenting in the kitchen"
1,Wrong book received,I received a different book than I had ordered. a1 responded to my first e-mail that he would try to get the right book back from the person it had been sent to. I was remiss in checking my e-mails for a couple of weeks and when I e-mailed again there was no response .I decided to let it go because a $7.84 book wasn't worth putting more time into. I just won't order from a1_auction_services again.
1,Too much information and bulky!,"I received this book as a gift and have been debating whether to give it away or not. Only thing keeping me from doing so is the thought that the gift-giver may someday want to see it! The book is HUGE and doesn't fit on any normal book shelf. It is incredibly bulky, heavy, and the wood cover makes it cumbersome. It requires way too much information and does not provide enough creativity to add in things that might be unique to your child. Many of the pages have long lists of entries - so if a few apply to your child the page looks essentially blank and you look like a bad parent. Would NOT recommend this book - everytime I open it I feel delinquent for not knowing the answers to all of the questions it is asking! Plus - it goes up until your child is practically in high school - some apparently like this aspect of the book - I find it to be way too much!"
1,Cheap piece of crap,"I should have never ordered this item. Should have read the negative reviews first. Save yourself the $2.40. Got this thing and the first day it breaks. My speaker fell off my desktop and the plug broke right off like it was nothing. Not worth the metal its made with. Don't order it. I decided to take the loss of my $2.40 since I'd rather not deal with customer service, even if I could get a refund."
1,Wrong Adaptor Sent,"I was sent a 1/8 to 1/16 (?) adaptor.I had to make an emergency trip to Radio Shack to get the correct adaptor, but Amazon did refund my money."
3,Reader Enduro,"Aa a narrative, this story is better 'read' via the DVD. It needs the visuals and sound track. The style ennervates: a lotta 'So we got a little drunk that night with these great Turkomen and their families who'd invited us to their niece's wedding, and got up the next morning with headaches and then we had five more punctures and ran out of petrol again.' Couldn't finish it."
5,Soft and wonferful blanket for baby!,"Since our nursery theme is Silver Lining, it only seemed right to purchase the cloud receiving blanket. I couldn't be happier... not only was it soft and just the right size to swaddle baby straight from the hospital, but with each wash (we use Dreft) it gets softer and softer, without getting worn! My only regret is that summer is soon approaching and it might be too hot to use a fleece blankie. Definitely a great purchase and a sweet gift."
4,Good for the Price,"It's a simple Audio cable to connect your audio out to your TV / AMP etc via the L & R connections. Its cheap , functional and it arrived on time. Its a good buy for the money and recommend it for people looking for cheap options for such cables. I had to connect my PC to my TV to get the Audio for my netflix movies :) and this cable does the Job."
4,Cheap and Functional,"I bought this cable a while ago to connect my computer to my stereo receiver. The cable shields fairly well and is of decent quality for the price. It is not gold-tipped, which means that the connectors may oxidize after several years, but I do not see this as a big problem. A balanced cable from Monster or Acoustic Research would give better performance, but the Recoton series is fine for most applications. I plan to buy two more to connect my 6-channel sound card to a 5.1 receiver I am getting for Christmas."
3,Difficult to Follow,"I really enjoy this series, but I found this installment very difficult to follow. Perhaps it's because, for a cold case, there were an awful lot of characters, and it was hard to keep them all straight. Even by the end of the book, I wasn't sure who some of the major players were.I also really wish the author would allow Jane to dump Hack or, better yet, kill him off. Running around for 10 years with a married man behind his wife's back, sneaking off to Paris, making phone calls on a phone card, etc. all make an otherwise strong character look stupid and weak. Hack is an annoyance who adds nothing to the stories, so I'm sure I'd enjoy this series much more, and be able to rate it much higher, if he was no longer around."
3,Very Disappointing,"This video was good as far as Biblical accuracy but it is ""cheesy"" at best. The actresses could have, at least, attempted to look more historically accurate. It was very distracting to see Naomi wearing nail polish! I'd like to see it re-made to be more authentic. Pull back the bangs, get some wigs and wash off the makeup ladies! I wouldn't mind so much if it cost less to purchase but it costs just as much as the professional videos."
3,There was no 'temple' in the time of Ruth!,"This story moves very slowly. The climax of it involves Boaz 'redeeming' a land parcel which involves marrying Ruth (& taking care of her & Naomi), and it takes place in front of a ""temple"" building. The Biblical scene was actually played out at the ""city gate""; there was no temple until Solomon built it 4 generations later. The only place of worship was the tent of the tabernacle.. which was probably still at the town of Shilo... not at Bethlehem or Jerusalem."
1,Let down,"What a travesty ! The book of Ruth is a beautiful story. The movie is a poor attempt from a low budget Christian studio... Come on, what kind of message are we sending ? That new Biblically based movies are a joke ? Only two of the actors could act at all, the wind was louder then the dialog in parts, and music came blasting over the top of everything. God have mercy."
2,The cardboard box survillence system,"This is a program which, when you install it on you computer, records every site you have gone to and saves a pic of it. this is basically your computers ""history"" file with a password. if you want to control what your children, employees, spouse, etc. watches a far better option would be to download ""Net Nanny"" or some other program and also password lock your history file (Preferences menu for Internet explorer).in fact, this programs main purpose is to scare others into not gonig to sites like that whithout permission. a good alternative: a cardboard box with wires running to the computer.it is much cheaper!!!! as you can probably already tell when i bought this from the store, i returned it within 2 days. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PRODUCTHappy searching"
3,"Pre-Coen, Coen-Style","This funky, goofy western is a little piece of 70s film noir that is a must for fans of Jimmy Buffett. One might ask, what was Jimmy doing in this movie??? Well, not much besides playing one of his early signature songs. The plot revolves around an attempt to preserve the west for westerners and everyone else be damned. It is clearly not the best work of any or all the actors/actresses involved, but Rancho Deluxe is still worth a view...not a buy."
4,Don't fence me in,"Thomas McGuane scripted this anti-western western comedy about two modern-day cattle rustlers in Montana who do what they do out of sheer boredom. Jack McGhee (Jeff Bridges) is from a wealthy background, while his partner Cecil Colson (Sam Waterston) is a Native American. They rustle a steer from rancher John Brown (Clifton James) which sets off a chain of basically unconnected incidents, most of them meant to be funny. The movie tracks the two rustlers but never really gets involved with them: the picture often feels as distant from them as they are from the world around them. As with much of McGuane's fiction, the script is drenched in irony and a sad sort of humor that rarely evokes more than a head-shaking chuckle. Slim Pickens, though, is excellent as an old dottery detective called in to investigate the case."
2,poor picture quality,The picture quality is lacking. It is dim and lacks vibrancy when compared to my VHS copy. Would like to see this fully restored in blue ray.
4,Great New Age/Science Fiction,"This book has stayed with me ever since I read it at the local library. It is well worth the effort to get hold of a copy.The blending of New Age and Science Fiction is well done, and I found that the New Age ideas stayed with me.As a basis for meditation it is unsurpassed."
1,Not worth the read,"I had read the ""Gates of sleep, Phoenix and ashes, Serpant's shadow, Wi_ard of London and The Black Swan"" all written by Ms. Lackey prior to reading this book. This book is long on self-rationality( dull, dull, dull) of the character's and short on actual action and plot. I do not recommend the waste of time on this to anyone. The ending was disappointing for a supposed simile on a fairy tale. I am sorry. The other books I mentioned were entertaining and recommendable."
2,"Been there, read that Melodrama",I used to be a die hard Lackey fan. FIREROSE taught me that Lackey must be overworked. I just cannot believe how a talented writer as Ms.Lackey can turn out such melodramtic drivel as THE FIREROSE. Predictable characters such as the noble and virtuous but poor as a church mouse Miss Rose...how trite! Was anyone really surprised by the turn of events? Beauty meets Beast. Love conquers all. The hero saves the day...and the city! It was a typical formula for a Victorian melodrama in every way. At least Lackey got that part right
5,Another Excellent Beginning of a Series that Never Developed,While a fantastically new and unique re-telling of the classic Beauty and the Beast tale; this could have evolved into a wonderful series as well. Perhaps one day Ms.Lackey will find an opportunity to pursue further themes with this.It's a wonderful book and one I enjoy re-readingfrom time to time.GSL
3,Same as older edition,"If you have the older edition, do not buy this update. It is the exact same, except for the cover."
4,Tool for tires,"I got two of these little jews, they are constructed nicely and I am happy with my purchase."
2,Unneeded,"I love Jasc to no end, its a little company making software with huge uses. However, this software really has no practicle use. This software pretty much catagorizes all of your media, your pictures, movies, avis, mpgs, waves, mp3s and so on. Other FREE software does the same thing! The only thing that separates this from the free software is the fact that it has a web slideshow function. It will automaticly export all of your files into a directory and create all of the HTML for you. Allowing for easy transition to the Internet. There are slideshow functions as well and it plays all of your waves, avis, mpgs and so on."
4,Easy Listening,"Having won the U.S. National Scottish Fiddle Championship on more than one occasion, this classically trained fiddler blends original compositions with traditional tunes. It's easy on the ears but pulls on your heart strings."
1,Lean Manufacturing,"I am currently looking for material on Lean manufacturing principles that that I can use for training our shop floor employees. I recently purchased ""Lean Visual Factory Management Principles....."". On viewing the footage it was basically a factory tour. It was very general and I found it to be very amateurish and gave very poor examples of a lean environment. Definitely not worth the money............."
3,Title,Did not dye my item black. More of a grayish blue. Doesn't look horrible however if you are looking to make your clothing actually black you may want to buy more than two. I will give it a try once more and see what happens.
5,A synthpop treasure!!!,"This CD is definately a timeless classic. It really does not sound like any other Synth CD I have. B!machine really focusses on delivering trance-like, atmospheric, melancholy driven synthpop with this Album. The tracks on this CD progress nicely and are well produced. Though some of the tracks are quite long, never are they boring and I find myself wishing they were longer. A highly recomended CD for anyone who appreciates electronic music with superb vocals."
3,A happy memoir,"Chuck Leavell's early career with the Allman Bros Band is the main attraction here. You will learn all about his feelings about Duane and Berry Oakley, the two lost brothers. Though he's now known mainly as the keyboardist for the Rolling Stones, Leavell had an interesting career before receiving that call. He is a highly respectful musician, so you won't read a single negative comment here about anyone. And forget any gossip about the Stones. There is none. He dwells at length on his band, Sea Level, a 70s fusion outfit that recorded some cool albums for Capricorn, but never took off. It's worth checking out that unusual music because it is quite good, in my opinion. Leavell became a Georgia tree farmer somewhere along the way, and that stuff is all deeply boring. You can skip those pages. For a unique look into a somewhat forgotten era of the beginnings of southern rock, this is an informative read."
4,Second Chance,"I passed on this book and its sequel, Ragamuffin, the first time I saw them. But recently I picked up the third book of the series, Sly Mongoose and really liked it. So I went back to read the first two books. The story isn't real original, I've read SF stories before about lost colonies. There is a lot of interesting back story in this, like the old-fathers who originally settled the planet and the war they fought to protect their new world from aliens. And the Caribbean culture of the people added a nice twist (although their dialog took some getting used to). I recommend this and both it's sequels. Read them in order though."
3,Fans can never be objective...,"From the OBJECTIVE reviewer...strong from beginning to end and ""Simple Life"" and ""The North"" rank with ""The One"" as solid songs. If he had moved away from the electronic sounds and stuck with a true band sound this probably could have ranked even better."
2,"It's good, BUT...","I found that in this edition, the songs going a little more faster, and the voice of Elton is not the same, the ballads don't is the same more faster. I don't agree with this. I prefer to listen my old cassette.I don't know if this is due to the two bonus tracks at the end, the disc have to be compressed in time.The same for the remastered album ""Sleeping With the Past"", with bonus tracks too.What a pity!"
2,Correction: 3 good songs,"Actually ""The Last Song"" is a tear-jerker of a song, it belongs with ""the One"" and ""Simple Life"" as the only good songs. The 3 are very good songs, but the rest of the CD really comes up short. Really Elton John hasn't released anything better since. For the hardcore fans only."
3,Remaster Does Have Better Sound,"There are plenty of other very good reviews regarding the actual contents of this cd. My review is simply about the ""re-mastering"" of the music. Be aware that some of Island Records releases of Elton John's studio albums are nothing more than a straight re-issue. Examples are ""Live In Australia"" and ""Greatest Hits 1976 to 1986"". This re-issue of ""The One"", is actually Re-Mastered with improved sound quality and Two Bonus Tracks! The cd has slightly more overall output and better bottom-end. I have an original MCA copy that was released in 1992, and did a direct comparison.I prefer Elton John's ""Classic Years"", the 1970's music the most, but since I am a big fan, I've been tring to purchase everything he's put out. The 90's pop sound is just not my cup of tea, that's the only reason for the 3 star rating. Just my personal opinion."
3,Not my favorite Haribo product,"I love Haribo products such as the Gummi Bears, Frogs, Mini-Frogs, Twin Cherries, etc. But...I'll have to say that I'm not impressed with the Techno Bears. I like the shapes and colors but their texture is very tough and chewy. And...I don't think the flavor is anything special. Some people may really like this but I don't care for them much. Let me put it this way; if I'm craving some candy and there's nothin' else around...I'll eat 'em. :)"
2,shiny gummy bears are weirddd,"I tried these and some of the bears are okay tasting. But some of them are grosss! And they are really hard to chew!Also, gross.Also, they look like they've been dipped in unicorn blood.Also, they are not worth the pain in your jaw when you try and chew them"
3,Odlly Expensive,"I got this at over half off with free shipping and it still costs more per oz than your average gummi bear. They're very tough and chewy, which I like but is an acquired taste. All said you;d be best off just buying 20bs of another brand for the same price."
5,"""The Greatest Game You Never Played""",This game is the absolute BOMB. It's a 3D first person cockpit online 58 player real time strategy space combat game (phew!). It is more fun than ANY game I have ever played. It is truly ground breaking and Microsoft had quite a true hit on their hands. The game is now completely free and controlled by the player community who still develop for it. 6 factions total now with more on the way! I may have tons of other PC games and all the consoles but I still play this game the most because nothing else even comes close. Check out http://www.allegiancehq.org/ to see the latest on what is happening with this game!
2,When a cute toy becomes a pain in the neck. This really was too good to be true.,"What a great concept- multitasking while doing housework. I can do other jobs while my Roomba Discovery gets a jump on the vacuuming. Unfortunately, only five months into this, I am paying to ship the unit back for replacement. (Most companies I've dealt with under warranty arrange prepaid shipping for you when it's their problem) However, speaking to the customer service rep left me feeling that Roomba's are great and there is clearly something wrong with me! Note that this was my third call in- second to a human. The first human neglected to tell me not to operate the unit without the small plastic bearing cap that was to be replaced, causing further damage, now at my expense. Anyway, buyer beware- this unit is not as robust as one would like. I hope the army is getting a better deal from this company than the general public."
3,"iRobot Roomba 4210 Discovery Floorvac Robotic Vacuum, White",In my opinion this is strictly for the neat factor. It actually picks up debris but it's so random in it patterns it appears to not be efficiently cleaning at all. It seems to miss random spots. Defiantly for the home that has nothing in it. Most obstacles and most of all my throw carpets give it troubles. Yup! just for the neat factor only.
2,Very Dissapointing,"I've had to RMA mine back to iRobot probably five or six times since the SE version came out. The last time, they said that it was out of warranty, and I'd have to pay $100 for two months worth of warranty.I recognize they were first to market with this, but it's been four years or so, now, and I think there are probably better products out there. It may be time to spring for a $2k unit from another manufacturer, becuase this Roomba SE is garbage."
3,Worked great until it stopped charging,"My roomba discovery was awesome when we first got it. It ran perfectly 5 days a week for a year or so. It's great to come home to a clean house every day.Then the problems started. We noticed that the charge wasn't lasting as long as it should. So we replaced the 60 dollar battery. Then it was ok for a month and then it just stopped charging. After some through googling, I discovered that the discovery had a bad mofset (its an electrical component) on the main board.Being an engineer, I ordered the new parts, soldered on the new chips and then we were good go for a few more months. It finally kicked the bucket not long after that. I'd stay away from the discoveries."
5,Suprisingly effective but a bit buggy,"We've had our Roomba for about 4-5 months and we've been surprised at how well is cleans. It also pretty tough. One day I caught the edge on a cabinet as I was picking it up and the plastic was pulled up. I was able to snap it back together again and it works just fine still. Every once in a while it acts a bit strange. We haven't downloaded the latest firmware, so that might help. Overall we've been very pleased and have recommended Roomba to many of our friends."
1,Do not buy a Roomba,"My Wife purchased a Roomba about two year ago. About a year after it was purchase the Roomba stoped working, it would not take the programing. My wife call Roomba and the replaced the unit. After about 6 months the Roomba stoped working again this time Roomba would not replace the unit. I think they only work untill the warrenty runs out. When we contacted the company they said that they could not help us. We will never buy another Roomba and would not recomend one"
1,Stopped working,"I really liked the Roomba when I first bought it. However, I found cleaning it out to be very time consuming.After about a year, it would simply spin in a circle. The manual suggested that the sensors were dirty. Cleaned the sensors, but the Roomba continued to clean only one section of the rug (still spinning in circles)."
5,Roombas are the bomb!,"This is our 3rd Roomba...they just keep getting better!!! We love the home base that it returns to on it's own when needing recharged. It is such a smart robot. It cleans very well, and the work is done while you relax. It is easy to clean after each use...amazing what it can pick up."
4,great vacuum,very fun vacuum cleaner :) does a decent job and saves time on vacuuming-- if you can stop watching it run.
4,Roomba rocks!,"How do you get a 16 year old boy to clean his room? Buy a Roomba. Our son was inspired to do a thorough clean-up of his room after using the Roomba Discovery. Our cat plays ""cat and mouse"" with it. It frees us up to do things we enjoy doing, while it does its thing. You can put on some music and do the rumba while the Roomba cleans. We esp like how it goes under beds, the sofa, and other hard to vacuum areas. Only one complaint--the brush gets tangled up with my long hair and other stuff it vaccums up; it is difficult to clean that brush. Also, I wish they would invent one that vacuums stairs!"
3,"Perfect when working, useless when not.","I got one used from Ebay and I regret it. It worked for half a day and the Circle Dance problem came in and it never worked again. I guess I'm the only one unlucky.The time it worked, it was absolutely perfect. It picked up LOTS of dirt and it didn't get stuck much. Too bad it broke so easily."
5,I love my Roomba,"I was very skeptical of this item, but it works great. I have very thick plush carpet and it does an amazing job. It does an even better job on the ceramic tile. Amazon.com had the best price. I am thinking about buying a second unit for upstairs."
4,A product that works the way it's supposed to,"We bought this product with low expectations (typical of an early adopter), but so far the Roomba has performed flawlessly. It's great at picking up small particulate matter (plus the random dust rhino), the only time it got stuck was when it got tangled up in my wife's bra (which I can relate to). It will occasionally get stuck under something, but when it does it just shuts down and waits for help. The product is as much of a no-brainer as I've seen. Push the button, it lets out a little fanfare, and gets to work. Our floors are always clean now (qualifier--we have a large loft with hardwood floors, so this is an ideal environment for this product)--not quite so good on carpets, it can pick up surface stuff, but does not do a deep clean. And it obviously does not do stairs, although it is smart enough not to fling itself down a flight (which puts it slightly ahead of my 3 year old). Overall I am very pleased with the Roomba."
4,Good sometimes,"We have 2 dogs and 2 cats, hardwood and carpet floors, and lots of open furniture. The hair and dust-bunnies accumulate faster then we can clean them and et's face it, I am lazy and don't want to vacuum every week. The roomba is not a replacement for a vac, but it will keep the worst of the dirt at bay. This is more of a sweeper than a vacuum. It won't pick up everything.Don't let your first experience throw you, however. When I first ran it, I had to empty it several times because it picked up that much dirt and hair and yes, the dust bin does fill quickly. After that initial experience, I run it every other day and it goes a complete cycle without filling up.It does get caught on rugs. Sometimes it gets stuck on the fringe. Sometimes the rug will actually lift over top. Other than that, it works well.It also works better on hard floors and less well on carpets and rugs."
5,Great for pet hairs!,"We have tile throughout our 5000 sq ft house and 2 labs, This little wonder gets all the hairs and the grit the dogs bring in... Works great! Saves time!"
2,"Loved my Roomba, for the two days it worked","Loved my Roomba, for the two days it worked.I called iRobot to figure out the problem and was told that I would have to return product at my expense and wait between 2-4 days before they would ship a new one back (they ship UPS ground) so it could be as long a two weeks before I received my new one.After discussing this with the Team Leader (who by the way says they have no customer service issues) this was the best that they could do for me. I expained that I only had the Roomba for 2 days and I argued that they should foot the bill (no go). I asked for an extended warranty since obviously the Roomba isn't very robust, again that was a big fat no.I did return the item to iRobot to try again because the couple of days that I had it, I loved my Roomba. The jury is out on overall performance since I am currently Roombaless."
4,Roomba 4210,"An excellent little unit. It's limitations are clearly spelled out and within those parameters it does a fine job. Works especially well on ceramic tile, medium pile and Berber carpet. Does a wonderful job in bedrooms; chasing down the dust bunnies hiding under the beds! The key is to keep the unit perfectly clean. I use compressed air to blow out the unit after every use and have had none of the problems reported online."
1,Beware of used Roomba's!,"We purchased a used Roomba Discovery on Amazon recently. It was advertised as being in like new condition. We charged the battery according to the instructions we found on iRobot's website. After being fully charged we tried to use it. It ran for a total of five minutes before the battery died. After a lot of trial and error and reading about the vacuum online we discovered that the battery should have been removed before being shipped. If you leave the battery inside the robot for a significant amount of time without vacuuming it will ruin the battery. Actually, in this case it ruined the entire vacuum. iRobot recommended we get our money back because nothing could be done to repair this robot."
2,Returned iRobot,"The day I received it a new iRobot the 5000 series was released. I had already run into problems with the iRobot getting caught up on my throw rugs with tassels and some of my many cords. It also would get hung up on lamp bases that were slightly wedge shaped. I saw the new series fixed this, and indeed Amazon was good on taking it in return since it didn't do what I needed it to do. I bought the newer model and it's working fine - I only lost it twice in a month so far."
2,A bucket of bolts,"Initially I was quite pleased, so much so that I purchased another Roomba for upstairs/downstairs use. Sadly after a year or so, One would no longer charge it's battery, the other would only charge and not vacuum. (So I can still use one by charging the battery first in the other.) Upon troubleshooting I found that there are so many ""leaks"" in the design that dirt would slowly accumulate and consume the entire internal circuitry and mechanisms, a recipe for failure with no easy authorized way to access or maintain. Here's hoping that newer revisions last a little bit longer than the Discovery."
5,love this book,This is really a great book if you are portrait or body photographer. I am currently completing my mfa in photography and this is supporting my thesis work.
5,Read this book even if you are not into science fiction!,"I am not generally a fan of science fiction but this book made a convert of me! It is an enthralling story with a strong and intelligent female lead, and is fastpaced and well written. In short, a great read!"
3,Not as great as it's advertised...,"This DVD is for ABSOLUTE beginners. It is VERY slow paced, and not much of a workout at all. I would buy this again only if I had never worked out 1 day in my life. The instruction is slow, and there is not much to the worlout besides talking. She says to do this DVD 3 times a week for ""the body that you've always dreamed of"" and that is JUST NOT TRUE."
1,Not my best purchase,"Some good stretching exercises but I don't feel like I will use it more than a few times. I did not feel like I had an invigorating workout or felt very relaxed. However, it seems to be a good beginner yoga tape to get your body use to the exercises and not strain yourself."
1,Painfully s-l-o-w and BORING,"Got rid of this dvd after watching it once. It is so painfully slow and extremely boring. Louse looks like created this dvd for herself. In this work out, she is placed on high stage and she is just enjoying and admiring herself during this workout. She talks very slow with this soft seductive voice that is so irritating and annoying. Besides self indulged instructor, the workout is so dull, boring, not challenging and extremely boring. Get Anna Caban, she has different type of workouts for all kind of audients and she works with audience, instead of Mrs Solomon who just screams ""look at me, look at me wonderful"" in every move."
1,Not good if you have allergies,"I will never buy a bagless vacuum again! I bought this one in a hurry when my Hoover stopped working. The Bissell CleanView II was on sale and, since I'd never tried a bagless vacuum before, I decided to try it out. I have been miserable ever since. I have a dog and a cat, and this vacuum doesn't have enough suction to get my carpets clean. The handheld roller worked for a few months only. Dog hair seems to get stuck above the canister, necessitating a very dirty job of emptying the canister. The canister comes out easily enough, but is much messier than a bag. I've considered buying masks to wear while emptying the canister, but think I will go back to a Hoover windtunnel. I don't know if there are any good bagless vacuums, but this experiment was enough to turn me off."
3,"Good vacuum, maintenance needed","Had this vaccuum for three years now...Initially it was great, did everything we needed it to do, vacuumed in a lot more then my old vacuum.Since then, I've had to replace a belt and the brush. Isn't too much of a big deal, came out to roughly 30 dollars. I guess when you look at the price of the vacuum when I bought it, 30 dollars may be a lot, but for 3+ years of service is has done really well.Would I buy another one? Probably not. Since then I've used many european ones (borrowed from friends) which run in the hundreds of dollars, but have lasted 10+ years w/o fail. This will get the job done if you dont have pets and have a relatively small and clean house, but may not be good enough if you vacuum heavily."
5,Top notch,This is a very excellent microphone for camera mounting. There is no hiss or hum. Certainly way better than what comes with most video cameras.
3,Adesso Keyboard,"Forced to use this style of keyboard for 'stand-up' use in a rather sterile environment. Mouse ball seems to hang-up after only a few months use, but can ususally be cleaned. Over-all a good keyboard when kept clean."
5,The Numbers Game,This book was well researched and fun to read. I have always been fascinated by stats. In fact that is why I am a math teacher today. I highly recommend it for any baseball fan!
4,Atkins is having fun,"Fans of John Atkins will love this project. While not being all that different from his 764-HERO releases, it does have some songs that deviate from that mold. Great melodies are everywhere and Atkins lets it loose, vocally. All the tracks are solid."
2,What a snooze,"I love time travel books, but it's so hard to find ones (aside from Jack Finney and Connie Willis) that are well written. This book reads like it was written as internet postings on a fiction site somewhere and just pasted together as a book at the end. It's disjointed, the characters are very one dimensional and flat, and it reads like a teenager's version of a time-travel romance. It was annoying enough that I was only able to make myself read half the novel before I put it down. There are much better time travel books out there."
4,Delightful,"Such a joyous, creative movie - a nice middle finger to the companies who packaged The Monkees in a wrapping paper they didn't really want. And Jack Nicholson! Yeah!"
3,I could see why it failed.....,"I understand that this project was to poke fun at the Monkees manufactured image. But to some it is a movie that drags badly in some spots. I would not recommend this to young viewers that are getting started on the Monkees. Seeing Howard Coasell and Terri Garr was a real treat! Even seeing Micky blow up that Coke machine was really cool! If the creators wanted to kill the Monkees project in a big way, they almost did it in one film. The best thing about the Movie was the DANDRUFF sequence... The bad thing is that Davy managed to escape and got to dance with Toni Basel, who would go on to do the chearleader video ""MICKY..."" other then that it was a miserable attempt of a film......"
3,Lost their head,"Too many drugs spoiled the pot. The movie was weird and had no direction. With that said, it is a real 60's type movie,if you want to see weird, than view this film."
1,Cheap Bootleg,"I bought this album in Stockholm Sweden, thinking that this was a official Malmsteen release. It's not. Though the tracks on this album are quite similar to the listing on the official release ""The Genesis"", ""Birth of the sun"" is released without Malmsteen's or his managements knowing. The sound on this album is fair, but it's not the real deal. Instead of ""wasting"" your money on this bootleg buy ""The Genesis"". I have both albums and my advice is: Buy ""The Genesis""."
1,Seems obvious,"The method is to produce a three page digital document with a catchy title, incurring no printing or production expense worth mentioning, then hope a very large number of people to pay six bucks to download it."
2,BB Reference Guide Review,"Overall the reference guide was not as informative as I expected. I also expected that the Guide would have contained more information, relating to the program itself. I may be incorrect, but sensed the Guide was written by a non-progam person.The contents, more specifically, word listings are readily available through a number of search engines, which in my opinion are more complete.The idea of presenting key individuals significant to the program is interesting, but also available in more detail through alternate sources.The product was delivered before the scheduled date, well packaged, and in excellent condition. This part of the transaction I would rate as 5 Star"
1,Terrible Purchase,"I assumed all tape adapters were comparable. This one worked fine for 1 week. Then it sporadically ejected itself from the tap deck. A few days later it broke completely and is now jammed in my tape deck. The tape deck on my car stereo is now broken as is the Macally Podtape. I would buy another a different brand of adapter, but I no longer have a tape deck that works in my car. My worst purchase on Amazon to date."
1,don't purchase,"Rollers were noisy, almost louder than the music. Eventually the rollers must have jammed because the tape player would reverse in the middle of a song."
3,Interesting - but not enough for the price,"I liked this book. I've read many books on WW2. Few have given some of the insights that I have found here. For example, the importance of allied airpower is well known, but in no other book has its power against the enemy been as well documented. I also particulary liked the insights given into the German high command's actions in the battles covered. But there are problems with the book, too. The allied difficulties in the Normandy hedgerows are not specifically delt with. Also, the maps are poor. Finally, this is an expensive book. Is it worth the money? I would wait for the paperback."
5,One of the Best Concerts on DVD,Just buy the DVD. Don't even hesitate - it's well worth the money. This is by far one of the best DVD concerts out there that you can buy. I love this concert and I watch it at least once a month. It does not get any better than this. I also bought the CD and listen to it everyday at work. Awesome!!!
4,A more refined Metallica?,This particular DVD seems carefully engineered and edited. The picture and sound quality are quite good and the included documentary is interesting. An added bonus includes the multi-audio as well as the performance of No Leaf Clover and Human. S&M is a good addition to any music DVD collection - even if one is not a Metallica fan. The synergism between symphony and rock is both noteworthy and enjoyable.
5,Incredibly excelent,This video is so amazing! I love the story line. Miaka is an awesome character. she is everything you should have in a main Character! I also think Tamahome is awesome! If you love suspence then be sure you get this one! The ending is a total clif hanger (thats the only bad thing about it) but it really gets you hooked.
2,So bad it hurts...,"Now lets see...how do I describe this show...well first of all I can start off by saying its definetly Shogo. Yup 100% Shogo. For the unlearned souls out there that means that this show is sorta like Sailor Moon. While Shogo doesn't mean that it has to be Sailor Moon exactly (its really a style of art, but then again most stories written in that art style are Moon-ish)...The thing that struck me right off about this show is that first of all there seems to be well...no plot at all. I couldn't bear to sit through the first tape and I might as well give it away to a two year old to watch. While the dubbing was ok the series itself was just plain bad. I would not reccomend this to anyone. If you want a good fantasy show go check out Slayers, El Hazard (magna only I don't like the anime), Ranma, or way to many other good fantasy shows."
5,Fushigi Yugi is one of the finest anime's on the market,"I have sampled many anime titles since I got into the market. This is one of the very few that I have seen that has rated getting the whole series. GET THE SUBTITLED VERSION, it's worth a few extra dollars and is well worth the price. I totally agree with the other reviewers on the voice characters being extremely fitting for their parts. THIS ANIME IS WITHOUT PEER, and only gets better as it goes along. BUY IT, you won't regret it."
5,Great tool for friendship lesson,"My 5 year old daughter is in pre-k. For months the teachers and parents have dealt with a common problem. Children in the class saying ""I don't want to be your friend anymore"". I know my daughter said it and had it said to her. While book shopping, my daughter picked up this book. I never heard of it, never bothered to look through it. What luck when we got home and I read it at bedtime. We took it to school the next day and the teachers read it to the class. It won't solve the small problem 100%, but it opens the children's minds that that simple phrase could one day have them feel very lonely in this big world."
1,Be cautious of these bulbs,"I recently built a home and installed these bulbs(not purchased from this seller) in almost every fixture. Of the bulbs that have burned out in the year since, half of them burned out within the first 2-3 months. Of those, half overheated when they burned out, causing the base to separate from the glass. It is possible that it was just a faulty batch of bulbs but my experience with them has led me to conclude that they pose a safety hazard to the user. I've had to shut power off in my home to pry the bases from their fixtures, I've had bulbs fall out when I remove the glass enclosures, and I've been sprinkled with tiny shards of glass that are probably still embedded in my carpet."
1,low quality hid kit and seller doesn't stand behind their warranty.,"Bought my xentec kit back in march of 08, it was fine for about a month then one of the ballast broke and sent back to the seller and they sent it back and was alright for about 3 month now its happening again and the seller told me to call manufactor. DON'T BUY. If you still want the kit there is a seller on ebay ebox909 sell the same kit for 88 dollars and free shipping but the best part is a 2 year warranty that they stand behind."
3,This book is okay...but not great,"This book is also over priced. If you are looking for information on how to do ethnic skintones without using RIT dye, this is not the book. Some of the information is okay, but really, you can get the info in this book online for free."
5,"Como un calendario de amor y de esperanza,","este libro tiene una frase QUE TE RECONCILIA CON LA VIDA Y TE DA ANIMOS para cada día del año !A mi, me hace levantarme feliz y estar muy de buenas con mi familia y en mi trabajo...LLENA TU MENTE DE BELLEZA TODO EL DIA, CADA DIA DEL AÑO... ¡PRECIOSO !"
5,A FORCEFUL BOOK,THAT GOES INTO YOUR MID WITH ONE HAPPY IDEA EACH MORNING...Let it work and you will observe a huge change in your own mooD.
4,Wonderful!,"I love this product! It stays in place and can easily be used for any shoe. It doesn't take up too much room in my shoe so it doesn't feel make my shoes feel too small. The only downside I noticed was that it loses it cushion after a few weeks, but even w/out much cushion it's so much better than nothing at all. I wear heels for work and I used to not be able to hardly walk but with this product I can walk all day w/out pain. I highly recommend this!"
4,Good for ballet but don't last very long,"I dance ballet in an adult class, and I noticed that going up on demi pointe really hurt the metatarsal area of my foot. It was affecting my ability to balance, especially on one foot. So I chose these pads for two reasons. First, I can't imagine dancing on a layer of gel, and second I needed something that was attached to my foot so it would not move around at all while dancing. This pad is perfect for these reasons. It is extremely secure in my ballet shoe, and I can still feel the floor through the pad. The only major drawback is that after wearing them for fewer than 8 classes (12 hours of dancing), they no longer provide the cushioning that I enjoyed when they were new. For the price, I kind of hate to replace them so often, but on the flip side I can't see going back to the pain I was in before i started using them. I would recommend them for dancing, but I do wish they came in pairs and were more affordable."
2,Minimal relief,"This just did not help my neuroma. I ended up needing a shot to quell the pain. The padding is too thin to make a noticeable difference. I'd recommend getting heat-molded, full-length insoles instead."
5,Food for the Soul & Your Pocketbook,"Suzanne Mulvehill really provides an in-depth, soul-searching, inventory for those who wish to strike out on their own. When you've finished with the exercises, you'll know who you want to be and be prepared to get there. Not only good for up-and-coming entrepreneurs, but a means to finding peace in the business world for any reader.MEMadison, Wisconsin, USA"
5,Gorgeous pendant,"This pendant is breathtaking in it's design, color and flash. A truly unique piece and a staple item in my jewelry wardrobe. Once again, I just can't say enough good things about these products."
5,"Easy, fun and true","It's so easy to believe what you're told to believe.This is a fine introduction to evolution, one that will be educational for novices and experts alike. TV is a plague on our country, but every once in a while a series like this one justifies having one in your house.Buy the book. Read it to your kids. Encourage them to think for themselves!"
1,Appalling,"I'm sure glad I got this book as a gift, because I don't like thinking that I'd have wasted money on it. UGGHHH!For 18 bucks, you get 12 pages of horrible art, and a mediocre-at-best cover illustration. This is a depiction Boba Fett ariving in Tatooine orbit with Solo, getting attacked by IG-88, and getting Solo to Jabba. Unfortunately, 95% of the story, dialogue, etc has been cut out. They counted, I guess, on it being ""The Pop-Up Comic Book"" to make this good. It wasn't. A horrible waste of money and resources.If I were the rest of you, I wouldn't touch this stinker with a ten-foot cattle prod!"
1,Holocaust Denier and Proven Fake,"David Irving has been proven to fabricate facts out of thin air and to misrepresent any true information in his research. He is a self-declared fascist and a Holocaust Denier, reader beware you will be only getting a well worded half truth in his books, along with an underling message from a truly sick man."
1,Fiction not History,"David Irving has been proven to fabricate facts out of thin air and to misrepresent any true information in his research. He is a self-declared fascist and a Holocaust Denier, reader beware you will be only getting a well worded half truth in his books, along with an underling message from a truly sick man. Instead try reading about Irving himself in Lying About Hitler: History, Holocaust, and the David Irving Trial -- Richard J. Evans"
5,Turning your life around,"Speaking from personal experience, I was aghast at the reviewfrom Lilgurl. She is in fact a little girl who could not understand the obstacles and malicious men her mother faced.She turned her life around to become a dedicated mother to her 2 children.This book is a life experience and those that are to young should not be permitted to read it, until they can fully comprehend, and not condemn their mother, but praise her for turning her life around."
4,DIY meets the Beatles debut,"Take one spin through this album and you'll know Todd Lerner worships the Beatles. Every song is truly unique. And each one is crafted with hallmarks of classic pop structure. Listen close and some of these hooks will stay in your head for days. (And that's a good thing.) Standouts for me are ""Baby"" and ""Song for Free""."
5,A craps collection,"A lot of good ideas in this inexpensive book, I especially liked the material on charting."
4,Cool extras... just had to find them,"When I first reviewed this DVD, I accused Universal of shorting the consumer several ""extra features"". I finally found them, I just had to recognize the little arrow at the bottom of the screen was separate from other menu parts.Sorry, Universal. I did not mean to be a complete fool."
4,Memorable and entertaining,"The first one was great memorable entertainment. The secondwas also entertaining but had some problems. I have wanted to see thedeleted scenes in the second one for a long time. The features are a good idea but as usual with Spielberg, the audio commentary is missing. I wish he would take the time to add one to his films. These films were meant for the DVD format."
5,Cool leather case,Very stylish leather case. Suits the camera perfectly. The only cons is that the extra battery case is separate from the camera case.
2,Good if you need help understanding Writer's Workshop,This book would be great for a primary teacher who never ran Writer's Workshop. If you've had experience or training there's no need to buy this book.
1,Zero Stars and Zero Value,"Save your money, this book can be summed up in 16 words: ""I hate AA and NA because they won't let me continue to drink and use drugs.""A total waste of time to read"
5,"Enlightening, Empowering, Inspirational","The Truth About Addiction And Recovery is an eye opening departure from the antiquated and outdated theories about addiction and recovery. It is absolutely enlightening, empowering and inspirational. This book is a must read for anyone dealing with addiction or supporting someone else on their journey of recovery. It gives the reader an alternative to the old fashioned way of approaching recovery as a test of faith and enables the reader to de-victimize themself and master their own destiny in a nature that promotes a sense of well being, both emotionally and physically."
2,To Bad,This was a waste of money. If you are looking for true Gullah. Avoid this book.Not sea island Creole.
1,Great recipies but just not accesiable with the markets we have nearby,Babbo provides a lot of upscale and time consuming recipes that do come out very well if you have the time. This is not for those learning how to cook and is really geared towards experienced cooks. The desserts are actually probably the most useful parts of the book. We have had a great deal of trouble finding ingredients in this book so if you don't have a lot of specialty grocery stores around this is probably not one to buy. Just a little too upscale for me and not enough recipes I can use.
4,really good with one excepton,"I love Mario Batali and like this book a lot because it's full of good ideas, has good pictures, and it's well organized. The only problem is there are quite a few mistakes. Either the editor changed important details or the recipes were not well tested and/or recorded. One example is the recipe for ROASTED BEET FARROTTO. It says to ""set up an ice bath nearby"" but doesn't tell you what to do with it. It also says to cook the farro for 20 minutes when it really only needs 10-12 minutes (al dente). If I were to cook it 20 minutes, it would be mush. Conversely, it says to roast 2 large beets for 40 minutes when larger beets can take up to an hour. I found similar mistakes in other recipes but if you're paying attention (and know how to cook) you can correct them and have some very delicious dishes."
2,Not what i expected from Batali,"I was really looking forward to this book, as i was very excited with Batali after reading ""Heat"". However I was rather disappointed when I start reading The Babbo Cookbook. I found it too flashy for my taste and i haven't actually cooked a single recipe from this book. Of course it's a restaurant cookbook, so a touch of ""luxury"" and haute - like attitude is a must, but I thought Batali was something further than this. I expected a more home-oriented style in this book, smelling Italy and Sicily and not so much NY.I do not know if the goal of this book was to capture the Italian spirit of cooking..If yes then i could not find it anywhere! So when it comes to Italian food & cooking I keep voting for Locatelli...."
4,"Very sturdy, minor inconveniences.","I am new to videography. I just bought a Canon Vixia HG10 (High Def camcorder) and wanted a tripod solid enough to hold up the camera without any issues. For that concern, this tripod is excellent. It does its job fantastically and is very easy to extend, lock, and unlock with the tab mechanism built into the legs.I do have one complaint. I set it up in my dorm to record me playing Rock Band (for split screen videos with the drum chart) and due to limited space my positioning is very restrained. It would make it much easier to be able to angle the tripod camcorder mounting plate down, but it locks flat at 90 degrees, level with the ground. This is my only complaint, it tilts up and to the sides very smoothly and as long as you tighten with pressure, the threads hold and do not unthread themselves.Overall I would recommend it, but if you know you want to angle any downward-looking shots, do a little bit more research before deciding."
5,"solid construction, great value","It's not a ball-joint but for the price it's quite good. Very stable, but perhaps not heavy enough if you are really looking for something professional. Build quality is quite satisfactory."
1,Tripod was defective,Item was shipped with broken handle AND an invoice that claimed a tripod bag was in the box! RMA procedure by Amazon is very good.
2,Does not fit the driver suggested as an add-on purchase by Amazon,"In all honesty, I don't know how this item works as I also don't know why Amazon is suggesting that this be bought with Skil driver 2354-02, it doesn't fit. It is made for a bigger driver. I just returned the 90921 quick change 21 piece drilling and driving set for that very reason. I would LOVE to have a drilling set that fits my driver but this one does not. I double checked with a professional before returning it, it is not made to go with the 2354-02 so it was useless to me and would be to anyone who has that product."
1,Research in a vacuum,"I may have been slightly over-critical giving this book a 1 star when it is actually quite readable. However, I could never get past the haunting realization that this author could never have possibly been to Iraq, met Saddam Hussein or any other government functionary, nor did it seem that she had ever really spent any appreciable time in the Middle East over the last 20 years. In short, I came away wondering how Ms. Mackey ever came to be considered a ""Middle Eastern Expert"". Does conducting research in a room in Atlanta and retelling the accounts of others count? In this case, I guess so."
5,Angel listener,"I purchased this book years ago and have used it on occasion until recently. This book gave me guidance to help make a major life decision, which not only gave me comfort it gave me strength to move forward with that change. I used it as a daily guide.I purchased this recently for a friend after she kept calling me asking what number messages meant. ;) She now has her own 'go-to' Angel guide. :)Enjoy! I, also, strongly recommend reading Healing with the Angels first. Very good read that helped me to understand things on a deeper level!"
4,Kuryakyn ISO Pegs,"These Pegs look great and are of an excellent quality. However, i tried to fit them on my Shadow Aero VT750C ABS 2012 and they are not compatible."
2,only for 5 years old and younger,"this is so basic as to almost not be valuable. It's pretty much a waste of money. I recommend getting a more advanced video, even for very beginners."
5,Exactly what we were looking for,"We've just started hiking and this book was exactly what we were looking for. It has a large variety of routes, all the relevant information, clear descriptions, good maps, and a very easy to read format. My only wish would be a summary of all 192 trips so we could quickly scan for specific criteria like difficulty and time."
5,ANother great read,"Another book from my African CIV class tht was ""looking"" to be boring and ended up being enthralled by it... it is not common that you get a textbook you loose yourself in."
4,Understanding By Design,This book was bought for a class I was taking and I feel that it is a good book because it gives very detailed information about the backward design method. It provides good examples and details of doing unit lesson plans. I think that it is a great resource for teachers and I highly recommend using the workbook and professional development workbook along with the book as well.
3,"Nice for tomatoes, not for crusty bread.","This didn't live up to my expectations, I ended up getting another bread knife, a long one from Chicago cutlery. This one just wasn't able to get a good grip on crusty bread and it could use to be at least an inch longer (TWSS). Still a decent knife for some things, but I haven't been using it at all since I got the other."
5,Kikkoman Instant AKA Red Miso Soup (9 Pockets) - 3.15 Oz - in 3 Bags,This tasted really great. It was my first time of ever tasting it and I am very glad I did. I can not imagine not enjoying the hearty flavors and the great smell.
3,pretty good but could be better,the taste is good but there are better options out there (trader joe's miso is alot better). not spicy as you would be led to believe. also dont like the fact that they put MSG in this mixture.
4,Excellent account of Das Reich Division,"This book is very detailed and gives an informative account of the organization, life, and disbandment of the most elite of the Waffen SS Divisions. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in the Eastern Front, where Das Reich did the majority of its duty, or some one interested in the Waffen SS Divisions."
5,Anthony LaPaglia makes this movie!!,"Anthony LaPaglia really shows off his acting abilities. He portrayed the character from every angle of emotion. I was on the edge of my seat in suspense as to what would take place next. This is definitely a movie where you have to keep your attention on the movie to enjoy every minute of it. I had wanted more even after the movie was over. I really wish they would consider a DVD release as this is one of his great films. This is on my top 10 list of movies. I recommend that you see this movie to see what one mans determination can do. I became a Anthony LaPaglia fan back when I saw his ""Innocent Blood (1992)"" a cute horror/comedy. I really enjoy his newer TV series ""Without a Trace""."
1,the picture on the item is not what you get,Since there is really no description besides being a thermostatic fan control I assumed the picture was correct and that I was ordering a fan clutch. Got the box today and low and behold the item I got was an electric fan thermostat that mounts in the radiator. I have found that Amazon has quite a few discrepancies in the name of the item and what the part really is. Another discrepancy I found was a power steering pump for a 1992 Ford F-150 with a 4.9 liter engine. The description was for a replacement pump but the photo was for a inline P/S pump filter. After reading the reviews apparently I'm not the only one who got fooled because several other persons went by the description and ordered the part only to receive a fluid filter. Amazon needs to take a good hard look at its online parts catalog and look for another source of catalog data.
4,Sangean DT200VX AM/FM/TV Radio,"Over the years I've bought several of these from CC Radio. I like the lighted dial & battery indicator. The ear 'buds' are terrible! They don't 'stay' in the ears & they are very fragile. My buds broke off after a few uses. The older ear sets were much better!The forward & back ""button"" was one piece, I prefer the distinct buttons, especially @ night.All in all, this is still my favorite pocket radio. This model has been discontinued @ CC Radio & replaced w/ more expensive model. I was very pleased Amazon still offers this excellent radio!"
3,Good radio fair FM,"This is a decent radio, but I'm afraid I live too far from a good FM source of many FM stations. It does receive more than my Sony however."
4,Worn out many,"I have purchased many of these unit over the years. I typically carry one with me every day and literally wear them out. I purchased two this last time so I would have another backup unit. I like this particular radio because it has the basic TV station audio in addition to the standard AM/FM and because it pulls in station signals very, very well. I tried the smaller Sangean DT-180V in the past and was disappointed by the reception."
2,Disappointed In Reception,"I looked at this item for a long time. Read the reveiws, which were all over the place. Some people thought it was great, others said it didn't pick up many stations. I live in a rural area and I must say I had my doubts when I finally ordered it. My intention was to use it hiking on the trail, and beable to catch the local news and weather on the TV channels. Well the one TV station it picks up isn't local, and it will pick up a total of 4 radio stations (which I could pick up on my $9 radio). Now the sound is good on those 5 stations, but I expected more for the price."
3,Strange tuner,"Itnhas a lovely sound but wont tune into stations that require a half number, eg 87.5, I can get 87 or 88, so be advised of this when considering buying it. I love the fact that i can store stations."
1,Worst AM/FM radio ever,I like Sangean. I have owned some of their Shortwave radios that were great. Bases on that I bought this and its pure junk it has a horrible time staying on any station.
3,Description of the item must be updated!,"I was very excited to order this radio after reading the positive reviews and even I expedited the shipping method, however, I was greatly dissapointed to find out that the TV audio does not work after the digital switch, and nowhere in the item page does it say that the TV audio is useless for this portable digital AM/FM/TV radio... I'll keep looking for a model that has this feature, as for this one the sound is great but I don't think it is worth the price."
3,DT220v is worth the Extra $,"There is something about the five push button preset station buttons on the DT220v... AND... The fact that you need to PLUG IN THE HEAD PHONES for an antenne on this model, that really ""tuned me out"" of this radio.I purchased it to replace my DT220v, because it was a little smaller. But once I checked it out, I sent it back on a rocket!"
3,Good Radio - a bit fragile,"Good Radio. Good reception. I liked the feature to turn the radio off in case you accidently leave it on. I dropped it once accidently and it stopped working. I had a walkman that I dropped multiple times while running until it was all beat up and it kept on working. The sound from the speaker is not so good so I didn't find myself using that feature much - it just added to the size of the radio mostly. I liked the radio mostly, but I think I will try another. I hope the next one is more durable."
4,A very good purchase,I am very pleased with my Sangean radio/tv. I have had approximately two months and use it at work. I can listen to NPR's Fresh Air every day and I don't miss any of the morning news on NPR. This is an excellent product.
1,When I received the radio it didn't work.,"On 8-25-12 I received a DT 200X FM Radio from Amazon, and out of the package the top tuning button would not work and the Favorites Button would not program stations into memory. On 8-27-12, I sent the radio to Sangean Customer Service, First Class Postage $3.48. As of 9-26-12, I have not received a replacement radio. They refuse to send the replacement radio until I send a check for $6.00 postage. Why should I have to pay $6.00 postage, when the radio did not work from day one. Sangean's Customer Service stinks, and this is what you will be dealing with if you purchase from them."
1,I do not recommend,"From the first minute I tried the unit I found that sound was not coming out equally in both headphones. Thinking the headphones may have been bad, I plugged in a new pair and found the same thing. When I moved the jack sound would come in and out and it appeared the connector was loose inside. This came with a manufacturers defect and now I have to pay $6 and shipping to have it looked at under the manufacturers warranty! I purchased this for football season and by the time it get's looked at and returned we will probably be 1/2 (or more) through the season - what a waste of $39. I also found the reception to be fair at best. The AM band is very directional so I could see myself constantly moving it around at games. I recommend another choice."
1,Sangean200 VX AM/FM/TV Radio,Reception not so good. Not easy to find the stations. There is no longer analogue TV reception in USA so that facility is useless. Would not have bought it if I had tried it first
4,Sangean DT200V AM/FM/TV Portable Pocket-Size Radio,"This has to be the best little radio in its class. Great reception, listen via stereo earbuds or the built-in mono speaker. AM, FM & your local TV stations 2-13. I had a previous model with the Radio Shack logo on it (same radio, made by Sangean) so I was well aware how the Sangean would perform: Outstanding for its intended use. There are only two things I would like to have on this radio -- An override for the 1 hour auto off & a momentary backlight for the LCD display. I know, I know. This would be more drain on the batteries but I think it would be more of a plus than a negative, especially if the rest of the radio stayed the same."
1,junk FOR SALE,"I HAD THIS RADIO FOR SIX MONTHS WHEN THE BUTTON FOR PRESETS BROKE. IT WOULD NOT WORK. SO I CALLED SANGEAN, VERY DISAPPOINTED. I HAD TO SEND IT BACK WITH $17 FOR REPAIRS. THE CASE NEEDED SOLDERING. STICK WITH SONY. THIS RADIO IS NOT WORTH TEN DOLLARS. 90 DAY WARRANTY JUST ENOUGH FOR THEM TO RIP U OFF!!!!!THIS IS THE SECOND SANGEAN I HAD TROUBLE WITH AND WILL BE THE LAST!!!!!"
1,porqueria,"amazon deberia ser mas selectivo con los productos que comercializa, pues este producto en realidad es basura, no mas en la prueba se barrio la rosca de un tornillo allen que sujeta el anillo de profundidad."
3,Answering a question from 2003,"I think they must have taken the title from the Wallace Stevens poem--same title-- it's a poem about poetry, so that makes sense."
5,Get this one,"This CD was somewhat of a surprise for me. I first heard a cut on Jazz radio from Berlin, then found the title and went to Amazon.com. Tierney is in my opinion the best jazz vocalist I've ever heard. Another surprise is the trio she has backing her up -- they are individually all capable of a CD on their own! Although many compositions were previously recorded by other artists, Tierney and her trio add refreshing perspectives and experience that improves them all. Jazz doesn't get any better than this. This CD is a pearl!"
1,Bad and disappointing service,I ordered the product on February 2. The seller said it may take 6 to 21 days to receive it by mail. It is the 3rd of March and I have yet to receive it. I will no longer do business with this seller.
3,Dont know if it works.. Taste was unbearable,I read rave reviews and ordered this product.I tried it a couple of days but the taste was just unbearable.. I might have continued to try it if my daughter hadnt gotten sick and requirement better monitoring of intake. I can't say if it works or not.. but it is worth a try.
2,Save your money and buy fenugreek pills,"This stuff made my gf smell like pancakes, which may not be a bad thing but it was a little disturbing. We found no benefit to this stuff over regular fenugreek pills, which are much cheaper and dont taste disgusting."
1,gross,"The taste is so aweful, I tried to find different was to swallow but there is no masking the taste!!!! Get the pills.."
5,definitely worth it,"Just got this cd and have listened to it over and over. If you like the Hang Ups, you will not be disappointed. It is more of a departure from the early stuff than So We Go-- more Beatles-like and not as minimal. They have lost the old trio sound, but have changed themselves in an interesting way."
1,Run!!!!!!!!!!,Various artists my hind leg! The only variation in these 4 coasters is the misery you feel when you remember you actually paid your hard-earned money for this waste of plastic. Save your money and your disappointment for something a little more worthy of your emotions and your wallet. You have been warned.
2,"Spare Bulb, anyone?","We used this nifty little light for about 10 hours.The batteries held up well, but the light bulb burned out mid-performance.We were prepared with new batteries, not new bulb.Also, it is cheap plastic and needs to be handled very carefully.We'll continue to use it with a stash of batteries AND bulbs.Also, bought the Might Brite Duet Stand Light.These have LED bulbs and position much better on the whole stand of music.Still made in China and cheap plastic, but will suffice for now.{{* *}}"
2,"Nice design, Poor Construction","I loved the style of the light, but it was made of weak plastic parts in which breaks REAL easy. The clamp broke immediately and then the switch came apart. Had to hot-wire it to get it to work..It still doesn't work right. Wish they would make it out of good, solid metal parts. It would be the perfect tool for any musician if it were made of good material."
3,To Slow For My Taste,This is a slow moving story set in the UP. There really is very little suspense or excitement. The story develops along predictable lines. Also the very premise of the story makes very little sense. If it is so poor one may ask why three stars. Essentially the book does give a good feeling for the part of the world. Also Steve Martinez the main character is interesting.
4,"Great, except for cheerios","Bought this for my kitchen floor, for quick clean ups.Pros: picks up most stuff, I am always amazed at how much is inside it when I empty it out, very light. Does a better job than my hand vac! Small--sits unobstrusively in my mudroom.Cons: does not pick up cheerios, not great for under cabinets, debris on the grout lines (which are a bit recessed) is often missed.Bottom line: I still love it as it easier and better than my hand vac for those quick clean ups. I can do my whole kitchen floor in a minute."
1,cheap does what cheap is,"I thought that a bissell would be a god product,based on my memory as a child. Well i was soooo wrong. It was cheapand it worked cheap. It lost it's bumpers within 2 weeks of little use and really didn't work well from the start Oreckis a far better and more expensive product,you get what you pay for"
3,A nice Christmas story,"""All through the Night"" is a nice Christmas story with a happy ending. It is easy to read and entertaining. If you like Alvirah and Willy, go for it. If you prefer murder and breathtaking suspense, read one of Mary Higgins Clark's earlier novels."
5,A Christmas Story as Good as Silent Night,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Alvirah and Willy make a great team, and since I am Catholic, I enjoy anything when somebody is trying to help the Catholic church. I was so angry when the theft was committed! No one should steal anything sacred from a church!This book is best read at Christmas time. I know that next Christmas, I am very likely to read them again!"
5,"A great holiday mystery, uplifting but not saccharine","This book kept me wondering how the mystery would unravel and had an uplifting holiday spirit, but it wasn't syrupy sweet. Another good read from the ""queen of suspense."""
4,Another book by Mary Higgins Clark that you can't put down!,"Mary Higgins Clark has done it again. ""All Through the Night"" was a wonderful book. I am a young reader who likes suspenseful books and this one satisfied my taste. It kept me on the edge of my seat during school while I read intensively in the last chapters, hoping that Stellina was reunited with her mother. Some faithful readers of Mary Higgins Clark did not care for this book, but I think it was a great suspense novel and one of the best I have read!"
3,It was a letdown,"This is the second book I've read by the author and compared to the first, All Through the Town, I was disappointed. I would say it fits into the ""cozy"" genre, and reminded me of the TV series, Murder, She Wrote. The crime solving middle aged lady was just as annoying as the one in the TV series, especially with the pin/microphone thing. I still gave it three stars because I know this type of book has an audience and it's just not to my personal taste."
4,October Baby,"It is very well done, and interesting. We also enjoyed the prologue with the woman who plays the real mother of the girl. I think the actors all played their parts well."
4,Perfect for a New Perspective,This movie was a little difficult to follow initially but after about 10 min it all came together. Excellent perspective from the survivor of an abortion attempt and the need to forgive. The extra clips are interesting as well.
5,wonderful choice,All in all it was a great choice in movies....very heartfelt and emotional...if you like that kind of stuff. Awewsome
1,Absurd,"This is a bald attempt to get viewers to rethink their pro-choice beliefs, or to reaffirm their anti-abortion beliefs, by setting up an absurd fiction: an adopted girl has seizures and suicidal thoughts and feels ""unwanted"", because she unconsciously knows she was the result of a failed abortion. Sure enough, she's told by her adoptive parents and her shrink that she was the result of a failed abortion (the odds of which are vanishingly small); parents and shrink discovered she'd been feeling suicidal and ""unwanted"" because they'd all read her diary, and the trio decided it was time to tell her that her bio mother tried to abort her fetus. You can imagine where it goes from there. ""Ask Alice""-level of plausibility. The movie is so hard to watch precisely because the filmmakers want so badly for you to reject reproductive choice."
3,Christian Movie About Abortion,I wish the movie review on my Roku/Amazon would have clarified that this is a Christian movie dealing with abortion. It was not appropriate for my particular group at that time.
4,October Baby,I absolutely loved this movie! I too am adopted and searching for answers. Very amazing movie. BUT don't forget the kleenex!
1,Boring and extremly conservative,The message of the film is very one-sided. The movie supports a very conservative perception of the world. The film has many lengths.
1,Collegiate Dictionary,"It is not easy to use , I was disappointed in ability to access words,. It would have been much eaiser to use if you could go to page and see all words as in written version/ I would not purchase or recommend this verison."
3,It's okay,We thought the print size was quite a bit smaller than the earlier version we had. We were not able to determine that before we purchased it.
1,Buy the real book instead,"The Kindle edition of this dictionary is useless. There is no good way to navigate to a word you want to look up. ""Go To"" only lists cryptic numbered bookmarks (over 1.5 million of them!) and you can't go directly to an alphabetic section. Using Search to find a specific words can take many tens of minutes. Skip the Kindle Edition and buy the real book instead."
3,The package doesn't include the CD-ROM!,The good news was the arrive of the package even if it came after approx 3 months! The book was in a good state (thank you!) but I cannot find out the acompagned CD-ROM! I am a little disappointed.
3,So-So Dictionary,"Dictionary has excellent binding at a reasonable price.However, its passion for dividing words into seperate catagoriesis tiresome and causes confusion."
3,I wish it had tabs,"What can I say? It's a dictionary. It defines words. It performs as advertised. My only gripe is that it doesn't have alphabetized tabs for quick referencing. So, trying to start your search in the proper place is a shot in the dark, which is a bit annoying."
5,Amazing,"This monstrosity of a dictionary weighs 3 lbs but for a good reason. It's the most comprehensive book I've ever seen, I haven't to date come across a word that hasn't been in it and the definitions are very articulate. The book even includes several pages explaining all the abbreviations and how to interpret the pronunciations. By far the best dictionary I've ever come across and worth it to someone looking for their first and last dictionary in this life time."
4,Indispensable,"A valuable addition to anyone's bookshelf, but an indispensable tool for an author's library.One complaint, and it's one I have with almost all reference books - the font is too small. But that's my problem and nothing against the book. I can't imagine how cumbersome a LARGE PRINT version woulld be. ::smiles::"
3,"Wonderful, but be aware: It's without tabs....","I grew up with this dictionary- it was the only one my father (who has a Master's in English) reached for. I was excited to see it in Wal-Mart and promptly purchased one, as my family didn't have a dictionary. My husband came home and said, ""Why didn't you buy it from Amazon-it would've been a lot cheaper!"" I returned the first one to Wal-Mart and bought this from Amazon. It's the same thing, except it doesn't have tabs at the side like the one at Wal-Mart does. I REALLY find them useful so that I don't have to open it and go leafing through it just to get to the letter section that I would like to search through. Keep this in mind when you order. I think I would return this if it wasn't a hassle and pay the extra $ to have the tabs...."
5,This book does NOT contain a CD-ROM.,"After two unsuccessful attempts to get a CD-ROM with this book, I found the correct dictionary to order. It isMerriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary, 11th Edition thumb-notched with Win/Mac CD-ROM and Online Subscription. If you search for Merriam-Webster's Dictionary, this book does not display. Amazon was very cooperative in returning both versions of this book they sent me (without any charges to return them).Since there is another version of this book that indicates ""Book Only,"" I made an incorrect assumption that this version had the CD-ROM. I am not really sure what the difference is between the ""Book Only"" version and this version."
4,Best Print Dictionary I've Ever Used!,"I also have the Oxford dictionary, but from what I've seen of that, it's more a dictionary of BRITISH English than American English. For AMERICAN English, I don't believe the Merriam-Webster's Collegiate can be beaten among the print dictionaries.I like knowing the origins of words, and this dictionary's etymologies, albeit brief, are very concise and informative. For my money, this is the only print dictionary you'll ever need. Highly recommended!"
4,THE ILLUSTRATIONS IN M-W 11th ed.,"It is in fact a great dictionary. I don't like one thing, though.Was it really necessary to include a drawing of practically every other animal and plant on almost each page??? I figure this space could have been used in a much better way. There are lots of words which would be more comprehensible had they a drawing next to definition. MOst of the animals and plants you won't even see in your life and even if you do I am sure you will not recognize them just because you had seen a drawing of a given species in a dictionary.I hope next edition will have some truely useful illustrations."
5,Any (English) word you'll ever need,"This is a great dictionary with A LOT of content. It has 1600+ pages and covers everything about the English language you'll ever need. I finally made the (totally overdue) jump to a pure English dictionary (English is not my first language) and I'm glad (I think) I did.This is the Eleventh Edition which was released 2003, so it is definitely up to date and apparently contains tons of new entries since the last edition.I still find it sometimes hard to understand words I look up, since in the explanation it uses other words I don't understand. So sometimes you end up in a chain of looking words up. But that in itself can be worth while. Sometimes I found myself looking up words I already know, just to fortify (haha) my knowledge.The book is definitely too big to carry around. So you have to keep it at home or whereever you intent to use it.I still keep my English-German dictionary around, but I hope I can retire it soon."
4,-It'll Do In A Pinch-,"I was looking for another dictionary for my kids when I came across this one. The price was really low, so I took a shot and ordered it. It's not as thorough as I would have liked, but it gets the job done. I went with the hardback, and overall the quality is on par with others in this price range. My kids are happy, so I'm happy."
1,Not compatible with the iPhone.,"This is an excellent tool that I use for class and it works fine in the iPad. Unfortunately, it is not compatible with the iPhone and that was the main purpose I bought it. So unless something is done I would not change my rating. Besides that I would recommended its purchase."
4,Indexing,The dictionary is a good one as usual. The index tabs are not exactly where they should be. Maybe they can not fix it because of limited space. Maybe Amazon can ask them.
5,How to heal with color,"Great book.. When I received the book I was surprised that it was so little. But, do not let that fool you. For such a little book it is jammed packed with great information. I LOVE the book. I have so many book marks in it. Can throw it in my purse and go off and do a healing.Thank you Ted for another great book."
5,One of the Best.,Ted Andrews is a true facilitator of healing. With this easy to follow guide you can implement these tecniques into your daily practice or use the skills for your own personal use. Great book for beginners.
4,Durable,It takes about 15 mintues to fill it up which is a little tiring but it is absolutely durable and perfect for outdoor. Would recommend it for the price.
4,Great mattress,I got this mattress mainly for camping purpose but use it when we have people stay over our place. It is easy to inflate even my 6 year old daughter can get it done in about 10 mins. The hand pump is not bad. I would give this product 5 starts if it included a foot pump instead.
4,Fair value for money,"For the price mattress is very good, we took it to 2 weeks camping trip and it did it job well. No deflations (it is NATURAL that the mattress loose a bit of tightness in the evening, but it has nothing to do with air escaping from it, but from a simple physical fact of cold air having lower density), quite comfy, two heavy people slept on it and still I was able to move without waking the other. In general good product."
4,Good air matress,"The bed is comfortable and the lining on top helps to prevent bed sheets or blankets from sliding off. I've used it several times myself and so far the bed doesn't leak air. It's just a basic air matress which was what I was looking at getting.The only thing about this is the hand pump provided does take me about 10-15 minutes to pump up the air matress but other than that, it's a good air matress."
2,Reeks of chemicals,"I barely had time to pull the mattress out of the box before the smell of cheap solvents, glues and materials hit me. The air pump in particular was offgassing some terrible fumes, to the point my eyes and nose were burning. I didn't have a chance to rate other areas of the mattress because I boxed it up and sent it back. I'd suggest paying a bit more for something that isn't going to fill your home with the stench of cheap manufacturing."
4,good value for the money,"We bought this bed because we were moving out and we sold our bed 20 days before we moved. It means we slept on the bed for 20 consecutive days, and the bed never lose air. The only drawback is the pump that is too small and requires bending down, and pumping from the knees to the toes."
1,Not recommended,I guess you get what you pay for. We received our inflatable mattress last week and took it camping this weekend. It did not hold air through the night and the pump broke upon using it the 2nd time. It's pretty much worthless.
4,Good Collection of Solved Problems,"If you want a good basic collection of problems and your math book does not have solutions, this is a good place for you to start.I wish more US textbooks published the worked solutions to all of their problems. While academic types tend to disagree with this approach saying that it diminishes the student's ability to reason, I must take exception to this.Using good worked examples allows a math ""consumer"" (such as an undergraduate engineer) a way to build his/her confidence.Those of us working in industry do not need proofs or generic problems picked for the benefit of the teacher (with ""easy"" numbers or solutions that fit easily into a template). Proofs are for applied mathematicians and those working in the more theoretical areas of engineering (or doing PHD work). We need good tools and mathematics (when intelligently applied) can help us.This book tends to demystify some of the more arcane subjects for the reader."
1,"Obnoxious, non-cuddly, battery operated, demon toy","This is the toy that people who don't have kids buy. They think ""Oh isn't that funny"" but in reality the joy goes out of this toy half way through the only song it knows.It can barely sing its only song without slowing down and slurring. It stubbles clumsily like a drunk barely able to stay up-right. It is not cuddly but rather a hard case surrounded by the thinest of fake polyester-like fur. There is no educational value to this toy.The only thing this toy is good for; we bring it out to show people what a lousy toy looks like so they know never to buy anything like it!I suggest that you just sing and act silly to entertain your baby rather than buy this junk!"
1,No Change,"I took this for a month and saw no change what so ever. It was a waste of time and money, at least for me."
1,More Fairy Tales!,"One more incoherent dose of revisionist myths weaved together by another ANGLO & ROMANOPHOBE! Mr. Duffy lumps a wide variety of peoples into the Celtic camp. One unsubstantiated claim after another and a paltry bibliography gives one pause to the authors true agenda? Here are some blatant false claims. An Irishman was not the first crew member to step on Americas shore with Columbus.Horse stirrups & the iron plough came from Korea & the Avars brought them to Europe. The so-called Celtic bagpipes & Harp came from Bronze Age Persia & India. The Romans introduced them to the British Isles. The Scottish tv show Tartan tv stated as much. Unless the reader believes all progress in history came out of the fictitious Celtic camp they should skip this nonsense! If you wish to learn more about this very questionable topic? The books by Malcolm Chapman, John Collis, Stephen Oppenheimer, Simon James, & Bryan Sykes are very worthwhile in shedding light on the truth."
1,incohesive,This is one of the worst books I have ever bought. What a mistake! I am interested in the Celtic people. This is not the way to learn about them. The book presents various bits of information about the Celts but in an incohesive manner. I didn't finish reading it and don't intend to.
5,Now I Know,"This book was a great read, escpecially for history buffs, and those who are fascinated by Celtic History. Kevin Duffy does excellent work bringing the reader from ancient Celts to modern day Celtic desendants and how they influence our lives today. Duffy also excells at painting a picture in the reader's mind of what Celtic life and times were like."
2,Tenuous at best. Not very well organized.,"The math behind this one is suspect if you ask me, but I'm no mathematical expert. Zeke proclaims to support his text by some very unusual numbers, but they might be right. There's something intriguing about what is suggested for pre-sets, so I had to spend the money on this book to find out what he was talking about. Definitely, not worth $20. $10, OK.Outside of the dice pre-setting discussion, the book is like a bunch of unorganized notes about the game. The table of contents will obviate that point when you first look at how the book is (not) organized.It would seem to me that you could get all you get from this book by talking with a craps player in a bar over a few drinks ... Rather, at least you'd get the same mathematical substantiation for pre-sets."
5,Democracy is Not for Sale,"In difficult times like these, when dissent is so marginalized, let alone presented as anti-American by the tight hold that dominant media have on the flow of important information to the public, I'm so grateful that educators like Leistyna are willing to take such a critical stance against the people in power in this country who are selling our human, civil, and democratic rights to corporate interests and those influential groups that couldn't care the least about what people in this country are really afraid of: poverty, racism, sexism, heterosexism, the domination of public media by private interests, the poor treatment of the elderly and the disabled, and the loss of public space, via deficit spending, within which we at least have the possibility to participate and struggle against those that think that our voices are meaningless. This is a fantastic book that should be widely circulated and debated."
3,An okay novel in verse,"Split Image was an interesting story. It was a short novel in verse about a teenager named Laura Li and her family. Laura Li volunteered at the school library. Everyone at the school thought she was perfect. However, that was far from the truth. She had many issues and was a pretty messed up girl. Her mother criticized and abused her. She started partying all hours of the night, drinking, smoking, and doing drugs.I was confused as to what illness Jimmy Li, her brother, had. He was very ill and needed Laura to do everything for him. I felt bad for Laura. She had to endure everything that was going on at home. When she worked at the library, she listened to everyone's problems. When she needed help, nobody listened to her. This short novel was great. It was definitely sad. Other than Laura's brother's illness, the plot was easy to follow. I wish Split Image would have been a little longer so that the reader could have gotten to know the characters more in depth."
4,Kenneth Lard,"I had broken the power adapter and I had been lookingfor anouther one. I found this one, it serves my perpose just fine and I would recomend to others.i"
1,Completely Worthless When Used As Recommended,"Both Amazon and Sony present this power supply as suitable for the ICF-M410V Sony Radio. (Check Sony's web page)Only when you receive the wretched thing and go through the slashing, cutting and hacking that modern packaging requires, do you find that this item is completely useless with the radio, emitting a loud hum that drowns out any reception.Now I have to package it up, write and explanatory letter to Amazon, and try to get my money back. Then I'll have to find a power supply that is suitable for the radio. I have a feeling that I am not going to be successful, as one of the other reviewers has found.So now I'm stuck with a radio that will only function with batteries, after it was presented as being compatable with a charger - why else would it have a female input for a DC jack?To say that I am annoyed is putting it mildly. What a bloody scam!"
5,the adapter did fit my portable cd player,"The reason I decided to buy it is because I do need it for sale my portable cd player together with the adapter in ebay, now I did not recieve buyer it is still mine"
5,yay noise yay!,"my daughter ask for this as a gift for her 8month old son. in winter. in minnesota. actually she asked for it for his birthday the end of april. but you can open windows then, right? she said he loves it!"
5,Great Entertainment,"Our baby (bought when 7 months) is very entertained when we play the hand bells, she even tries to make them ring. The wave drum is very durable, ours has been stepped on, stood on, dropped on tile (many many times) and is still in perfect condition! She even likes the glockenspiel, she'll roll it quite a bit! Everything is very high quality."
5,Entertaining and pleasing to adult ears,"I bought this primarily for the xlyphone. The hammer is appropriate for my 1 year old to use, and she delights in being able to make it make noise. Best of all for me, the noise is actually not unpleasant. This has been one of her favorite toys since she got it for her birthday.The other items are fun, but honestly, she is both too old and too young for them. Too young as she does not grasp the concept of playing them together with others, too old as ""rattles"" and such do not appeal to her. However, I hope she will grow into it as she gets older. She will also grow more into the xylophone as she gets older too and has more hand coordination."
1,Awful disappointment,"My 6 yr-old son bought this with his own money and has already offered to give it away to any friend who shows a remote interest in it. The pieces fit together poorly, if they fit together at all. The car doesn't launch all the way around the track. The only fun thing is the slime, and you can buy or make slime separately. BTW, the slime WILL stain carpeting.No fun!"
1,"It would have to improve a LOT to even call it ""junk""","Good concept, horrible execution. The kids love playing with the slime and abandoned the toy itself in 2 minutes. It didn't work once!"
1,Craptacular!!!,"This thing a piece of garbage! I knew going in that it was going to be bad (read the Amazon reviews) but this was at the top of my 3 year old son's wish list. I tried to talk him out of it, but to no avail. As stated before: set up is difficult and makes you want to crush the whole thing into a fine dust, the slime sticks to everything, finding a car that is light enough to be launched is a feat, if you look at the thing wrong it will fall apart, and it's too expensive. We pulled out the slime after the first time that he play with it (and got it all over his clothes) and replaced it with some different slime. It doesn't ""flow"" nearly as well but after a while he did not seem to notice. He DOES seem to like the horrible contraption, but hopefully that will fade quickly and we can toss this mass of crap.Buy this ONLY if your child will not accept any substitutes."
1,Junkano!!!,Pure junk!! This toy should never have made it to the shelf. Who ever tested this product and gave the OK on this piece of junk needs to have their head examined. Pieces to do not fit together and most hot wheels cars do not work with it. Thankfully we didn't open the slime. It goes back to the store tonight!!!
1,NOT FUN AT ALL,THIS TOY ISN'T FUN FOR THE CHILD OR THE PARENT. I WOULD RATE IT A 1/2 STAR IF THAT WAS AVAILABLE! IT TOOK 1 HOUR TO PUT TOGETHER BUT WHAT YOU DID PUT TOGETHER FELL APART EVEN BEFORE MY SON TOUCHED IT. THE HEAD THING ON TOP WOULDN'T EVEN COME TOGETHER AND STAY PUT. WE NEVER EVEN TOOK OUT THE SLIME. WE DID THE BEST WE COULD CHRISTMAS EVE AND LEFT IT. MY SON SAYS THE ELVES NEEDED TO MAKE IT WORK RIGHT. WHAT A DISSAPOINTING SANTA CLAUS GIFT. I'M TAKING IT BACK NEXT WEEK.
3,Junky toy but my son loves it!,I was so angry when I unpacked this toy on Christmas Eve. It is a piece of junk and they advertised it like crazy so it was the only thing my son asked Santa to bring. After I called Hot Wheels to complain and they agreed to refund my money I let my son play with the slime. He loved it! He does not care that it falls apart or that the cars do not work. He just loves the slime oozing and pretending that the cars are burning up. It kept him busy for 3 hours yesterday. I would only buy it for $15 or less.
1,Manufacturer doesn't care that this is junk,The slime is gone after a few play times and you have to buy more. A waste of money. My son helped a neighbor do yard work for two weeks so he could earn money for this piece of junk. It is fun to watch the volcano erupt but the slime cleanup is awful. You have to buy more slime from the company if you happen to run out due to all the clean up required. I payed $8 for a 1 cup jar of slime that they had to send me. The manufacturer said they would take my comments down but they really were not going to do anything about it. It is not worth the money at all.
1,Terrible Quality,The quality of this toy is so bad that my 4-year-old son recognized that the toy wasn't made well. It takes an incredible amout of time to assemble and falls apart easily. I took it back to the store because my son was so frustrated I couldn't take the temper tantrums. Hot Wheels needs to review the quality of this toy before it damages the reputation of their entire line of toys.
2,Not worth the money,"The slime is a mess and if you use it, you have to take the thing apart every time and wash it, then put it back together, which was no easy feat. We ""lost"" the slime after the first time playing with it, to my 2 boys' dismay. Also, it is very tempermental about which cars will work on it (none included!!). Some get slingshot off the track and others can't even make it up the ramp. We have found 3 cars that work and my kids have fun with it(...). it is very overpriced."
1,Don't waste your time or money,My son received this for his 5th birthday. We got it put together and found that the head on top didn't stay together well. Then the launcher would not launch any of the cars we tried with enough force to get it to round the track...and we tried MANY that were both Matchbox and Hot Wheels brand. We decided to bypass the launcher and try it by just pushing the cars. The buttons the cars drive over to activate it are placed so high that the cars get caught and can't go past. The track is so poorly made that many places don't quite line up right and the cars get stuck. I've never returned a toy that has been opened and played with...but this one is going back! Imagine how upset my 5 year old was that his very cool new birthday gift was such a dud.
1,HOUSE-DESTROYING JUNK,"I can't begin to tell you how much I hate this toy. Like every other young boy in America, my 4-yr-old son received Slimecano for Christmas. It is so flimsy and dull, plus it doesn't work. The directions say that the entire track needs to be cleaned after each use with slime. This cleaning needs to be done by hand and requires disassembling large portions of the track. How ridiculous is that? To top it off, the slime stains everything and does NOT come off/out - a small amount got on the wall, left a bright pink splotch and required two coats of Kilz paint before we could touch up the wall color. My advice? Buy something made by Matchbox - last year's ""Ice Mountain"" was awesome and well worth the $40 - it still gets played with a few times every week."
1,another poor design,"the parts don't fit together properly. the cars don't do what they are supposed to do. Like many hot wheels kits from the last 15 years, over engineered and poor performance."
1,Stains Everything,"The slime has stained our Kitchen table, clothes, and hardwood floors. It's headed for the garbage heap as I write"
1,Cheap Plastic toy,My son got this for Christmas and the first thing we noticed is that most of his hot wheel cars were either to heavy or to wide.Over all very disappointed in this toy and it will be returned after Christmas.
1,A Former Follower,"Having seen Gary Null on the PBS show, I thought I would take a look at this book. I had previously been a long time radio listener of Gary Null, but as his behavior and health claims became more bizarre, I could no longer listen to him. That said, I thought his PBS presentation was interesting and I thought perhaps this book would be as well. Unfortunatly, although there are some good points in this book for people who don't know anything about healthy eating habits, this book is mostly opinion, rather than fact. Rather then waste money on this book, I would advise others to look at books written by authors such as Drs. Ornish and Weil. These authors, I believe, are men of integrity whose main goal is the spreading of the message rather than the aggrandizement of the messenger. Good Health."
4,fun toy,"My daughter got this for her first birthday. Putting it together wasn't a heap of fun, but it wasn't extremely difficult. My daughter immediately picked up the ball and put it down the center chute. When the music started she squealed and then jumped up and down. She played with it for hours that day. She loved chasing the balls and found that duplo blocks don't go down the chute like the balls do. My 4 year old neice makes a game out of chasing the balls when my daughter sends them down. They just have so much fun. She has so many toys for the small space that she has, that I rotate what she has out every few weeks. Everytime I get this back out she is delighted with it all over again. It seems to be durable enough as my daughter is now 21 months old and it is still standing."
5,My twins love this toy,My sons were given this toy last year for Christmas... a year later they are still playing with it.. The love watching the balls go down and the lights and music... The only thing is watch for the balls they tend to get lost.. buy extra ones if you can..
5,Use with Caution,I bought this toy for my 10 month old daughter. She loves it. I advise parents to be cautious and remain directly with your child. This toy tips easily and the wide base is deceiving. Standing up safely isn't as easy as the title would lead you to believe.
2,"Not ""Pull-Up"" stable and not that much of a blast","My husband brought this game for our 8-month old, who is very active. He pulls himself up to standing position, but we have to hold on to the toy since it's obvious it would tip over if we didn't. Our little one likes the game, but looses interest in it pretty fast since he can't both drop the balls in to the holes AND watch them roll down on the spirals at the same time (unless he falls after dropping them in the holes ;-) )I guess that after a short while it gets too boring for him (""Okay, I got the point. Now what?"") and then he moves on to other more interesting games.It's nice, but should have been better planned and be more fun that it is. Not an award winner in our household, but not really bad either. Nice to have, but not a must."
4,NOT SAFE - Buyers beware!,"I purchased this toy for my 11 month old daughter, who had been pulling up on things for over 2 months. The first time she pulled up on the toy it tipped! I stood over her while she played with it, then it happened faster than I could move - it tipped, smacked her in the forehead and then she slammed her head against the ground. I called Fisher Price and they sent UPS to pick up the toy and will be refunding my money. They toy was put together properly, and my daughter was adept enough at pulling up to not have problems with anything else.I don't think this toy was put through the proper tests - otherwise it NEVER would have been marketed as 10+ months. I'm extremely dissapointed in Fisher Price.Its a great idea for a toy, and the music is great - but unless you plan on standing on the base of the toy to hold it down, don't waste your money."
3,Not my toy of choice,"We received this toy as a gift for our 1 year old daughter. She is a very active and creative child that seems to always have this toy upside down with a million other objects in it. Plus the first day she got the toy she figured out how to make the toy play with out a ball being dropped down the hole and would just do that instead. We have already taken it apart once and reassembled it due to her putting her weight on the top part and making it look more like the tower of pisa. Keep in mind She is a petite 1 year old. The toy was fun for a few days, but she still seems to have more fun with the box it came in."
5,we like this at our house,My mom got this for my son for christmas. he was only 4 months but i took it because i have a 21 month daughter and they both love it. now that hes 8 months and started walking he pulls it all around the living room. its very easy for them to use the buttons in a good spot so even if they dont mean to turn it on they do. my daughter loves the balls and steals them from him all the time. the only problem i wish i had 2 because the fight over it it funny one on one side and the other on the other side over who gets to use. its a really cute toy
5,Good toy for baboes learning to stand.,"The toy we have is different from the picture here, perhaps the newer version. The base is broader, and the toy is very stabile. My 8 1/2 month old girl loves to pull herself up on it and put the balls through. The music is a great encouragement to put the balls through."
2,not the best pick,"sure this toy is fun for the first couple days, but it loses interest fast. once my son fiqured out how to do it, he never really touched it again"
2,Not to good!,"This toy was horribe to put together, after about a half hour of doing it myself, my husband finally got it about 20 minutes later. My 1 year old daugter seems to enjoy the balls the best, banging them together. She seems to have fun with standing up and watching the middle part swirl, but thats about it. If anything I am happy it came with the balls for her to play with. I would've returned it if we didn't spend so much time putting it together!"
1,Not Satisfied,"This toy was not created well for babies standing and starting to walk. My 9mo old kept falling down and while still holding the toy the toy fell over with him. Also, he would try walking while holding on to the wheel and the four feet at the bottom would trip him. They are out way to far for a first time walker. ..."
2,NOT STURDY FOR BABIES PULLING UP,I received this toy as a gift when my daughter was 6 months old and starting to pull up on furniture and tables. This toy was very wobbly for her to use to stand up and was not stationary even on our carpet. We had to push it up against a chair. Now that she's walking she just takes the balls and runs with them. She does enjoy the music though.
3,Do not buy,This toy is dangerous. My 19 month old daughter had her arm stuck in the hole at the very top after trying to retrieve a ball that she dropped in their. It took my wife and I at least 30 minutes to free her after taking the toy completely apart and using veg oil to squeeze it through.Luckily my daughter just had a couple of scrapes and not a broken arm.
3,Cute music but that's about it,"My twin boys loved to hear the music and see the balls go down, but as soon as the music stopped, so did their interest. When one of them finally did want to play with it, the top popped off! I did report the problem to FP and was given a refund, but I was dissapointed in the quality of my specific toy, and the lack of interest my boys had in it. However the FP ""Baby Playzone crawl and cruise playground"" was a much bigger hit. It has balls, lights and music, but also other activitys that I can see them thinking about. They love crawling under the bar and sitting in the middle of it."
3,Left something to be desired,"My 9 month old daughter likes the balls that this toy comes with and she likes to pull herself up on this toy, but sometimes it tips over on her. She gets bored with watching the ball go down the ramp, but the music and lights get her attention."
2,not worth the money,"I have purchased several toys for my son, however this is one that seems not to have any really enjoyment for him. At 9 months when he was cruising, I thought he would like to pull up on it and play, however he was more interested in the balls that came with the toy, and never really took to dropping the balls in the holes. Recently at 10 months, he proceeded to turn the toy over and push it around(not the intended purpose of the toy). The music is also annoying(it is the same tune as all the other fisher price toys--they need different music for different toys).My friends son, however enjoyed playing with the toy when he visited, however he is a more stationary baby.I would not recommend this toy for an active, and exploring infant."
1,my daughter was injured,This toy flipped over when my daughter tried to use it. The toy knocked her down backwards and left a huge bruise on her forehead and over her eye.I do not recommend it.
1,Had to Call 911,"This item was given as a gift. We loved it when we first received it. Unfortunately, when my daughter was 11 months old I had to call 911 because she had her arm stuck inside the center hole. I was unable to get her arm out and it took 3 EMTs to remove her arm. I was told by one of the EMTs that this wasn't the first time he has seen this with the toy. I have called Fisher Price and they are looking into the safety end and a possible recall of this item."
1,Does not work like on tv,"this toy was the hardest of ten to put together and the balls don't role out real easy, they all go to the same hole even when the toy is level/ not very strong plastic"
3,Fun toy!,"My son got this for Xmas when was almost 10 months old.He was just learning to crawl and pull himself up to things, sohe couldn't reach the top for a little while. Now he can standnext to it and drop the balls down the hole and he loves the music. The push button smiley face was hard for him to push down to make music for a while. He'd rather push the little yellow ones on the inside instead. He takes the balls all over the place and he loves to throw them. He has a fun time with it!"
5,His Favorite Toy,"My son recieved this toy for Christmas at 8 months old. My entire family has gotten a huge kick out of watching him learn to dance holding onto it. I guess I've been lucky; he's never gotten his arm stuck or fell over. For us it has been the most exciting learning toy to watch him with. There were several different phases he went throuh as he's gotten older. He's now 14 months and still plays with it. I can't say enough about how fun it has been to see him realize where the balls were going to come back out. He would put them in the top, then bend over and look into the bottom. The dancing was just adorable as well!! We love it!"
5,THE ONLY TOY MY ONE YEAR OLD PLAYS WITH!,"My one year old boy got spoiled for his First Birthday, but this is the only toy he has played with from the beginning and still plays with. His Mom and Dad enjoy it's lively tune as well! A great, just-for-fun toy!"
3,"Not a dissapointment, but not the toy of the year either.","I had been told by friends that this was ""the toy"" to get for a baby who was just pulling up and on their way to walking. Maybe they didn't have a three year old who plays with all the toys for her younger sister either. I think that my 10 month old will enjoy this toy more as she grows. ... . I really like the fact that this toy gives you the option to have the volume loud, soft, or off. More electronic toys need this option. Overall, this is a good toy for potential walkers and will be even a better toy for beginning walkers and with playgroups."
2,It's nothing to write home about,This toy looks very attractive with it's bright colors and snazzy tunes but it is very unstable. If your little one is just learning to pull him/herself up be very careful. Your little one will trying and pull themselves up but the toy is not at all strong enought to support them and it will tip over onto your child. It's great for playing with your child on knees but standing up is not a good idea
2,TERRIBLE!,My husband and I really don't like this toy. First of all it is not very sturdy - my 8 month old easily tips it as she tries to pull up to standing. And it slides across the floor as she tries to pull up on it. Worst of all it is designed poorly as the the balls get stuck in the track as they spiral down - very annoying. It's too bad as this toy has potential. My daughter loves to stand and play and likes the silly music the toy plays. But now she only plays with the balls the toy came with.
1,EXTREMELY DANGEROUS,"I purchased this toy for my daughter because it implies that it helps them to pull up and stand. My daughter grabbed the handles and as soon as she tried to pull herself up, the toy toppled over and she landed on her back. I returned it immediately! I would not recommend this toy."
1,THANK YOU! I won't buy this toy!,"I for one appreciate the information from the parents of babies with problems getting their arms stuck, and rather than buying a potentially dangerous toy, I will take the advice of those who have experienced these problems firsthand. Safety is not just about supervision, but also about not putting your child into a bad situation to begin with."
2,BORING,"My child liked pushing the button that made the music. That was all it was good for. The beat was fun and happy, but the rest of the toy was a flop. Tipped too easy for early standers. Balls all over the house. Never could find a ball when you needed one. Other items got stuffed in it and stuck. Don't waste your money."
4,Fun! But not for learning to pull up.,"I bought this toy for my 25 pound 9 month old son (yes, he's a big boy). He loves the flashing lights and he ""dances"" to the music. He quickly learned to use his finger to push the little buttons inside the chutes to make the music play. It works okay if your child is pretty good at balancing himself while pulling up, but it will tip over on him at times. Overall, a pretty good toy for the money, but not the stablility I expected from Fisher-Price."
4,Standing AND playing with balls.... how great is that??,"This is a great toy - kids can stand AND play with balls - two favorites for this 8 month old! It would be a 5 star except that the stand could be heavier duty so that it doesn't tip when little ones try to pull on it to stand up. Also, about half of the time the balls get stuck in the bottom and don't roll out the exit ramps. When you overlook those two things... this is such a fun toy!"
2,Big Disappointment,"I purchased this toy for my 9 month old. She was learning to pull herself up and stand. I had to assemble the toy and the pieces didn't fit well so the balls got stuck. As my child tried to pull herself up, the toy would tip over and fall on her. Thank goodness the toy is light and she wasn't hurt. I was very disappointed, and finally returned the toy to fisher price. I don't recommend this toy to anyone. Something is wrong if it can't support the weight of a child. I got a crawl and play gym instead and love it!"
4,fun with caution,"Now that my son stands well and uses his legs to stand up with more than his arms to pull up with I like this toy better. At first we was forever pulling it over on himself. And once he did get his arm stuck in it too, but all in all it has been a fun toy. Now that he is a little bigger and stronger he does not pull it over (only when he wants to) or get his arm stuck. If you are thinking of getting this for a new stander be careful. It is still pretty fun."
3,I wouldn't recommend this toy for younger children...,"Overall this toy was what I expected, but at about the age when you would purchase this toy, my son was pulling himself up by holding onto things, so this toy just toppled over on him. Granted it is lightweight and certainly did not harm him, but I think the construction could have been a little better. But I must say that once he was standing up and we held the toy in place, he really enjoyed it."
2,DANGEROUS!!!,There are a lot of reviews gone here. I read 238 reviews here last week and a lot of them need to be read. Don't buy this toy. Children are getting their arms stuck and some have even had to call 911 to get their children out. The top comes off at any given time and if you put this toy together than you have seen the sharp rod that is exposed. I bought this toy for my daughter and as she tried to pull herself up on it she fell backwards and the toy landed on top of her smacking her in the face. It's not properly weighted. This toy should be the next recall!!!
1,DANGEROUS!,"DON'T BUY this toy!!! I let my daughter stand holding on to the toy and it toppled immediately. Not only did she fall and hit her head on the floor, the toy fell over her and hit her forehead. I don't understand why this toy got an award. All I can tell that it's poorly made and it's dangerous."
3,For the Birds!,"This did not satisfy my yen to hear my favorite bird call which is the loon. In fact, I thought the whole CD was not up to the quality I'd like to have. So I wouldn't buy it again."
2,EMI both Radiated and Conducted,"This switching supply generates radiated and conducted interference. I can't recommend it for powering a radio, or operating it in the vacinity of a radio. When current draw is very low, it produces 120 Hz noise also. A better design one would expect from Sony."
1,You've Got To Be Kidding!,"Yep, Original Artists, they dug these great folks up after 35 years, stuck them in a small closet, hired third rate musicians, and recorded their original hits. Some of the efforts are so rediculous you can't help but laugh. These are great folks from a time when we were younger and passionate. Unless you can't tell the difference between a Howler Monkey mating call or a jet engine under full thrust for takeoff, don't waste your money or time on this Canadian fiasco."
2,Not an OS X application,"What it doesn't say here nor on the finalemusic.com website is, this is an OS 9 (""classic"") application. If you have managed finally to dispense with all your ""classic"" Mac applications, you'll want to think twice before ordering this one. It's so ""classic"" that the Installer tells you it can't be run under OS X but you must REBOOT into OS 9 before installing!This was a shock, because the same company's Finale NotePad -- surely the best value in free software anywhere! -- does run native in OS X."
2,not objective. quite opinionated,"As I work in the computer industry, I thought an objective book on the effect of pornography on society would be an interesting read. Unfortunately, this book is not objective, and I have had a very difficult time trying to read it. Like on the news were they finish a clip and have to add in their own 2 cents, ""oh that's horrible Jane. I agree Mike""...the author adds her opinion to the text."
4,KitchenAid KMTT400BW 4-Slice Metal Toaster,"toaster works fine. Minor criticism: a little slow, and toaster wells could be an inch deeper to accomodate larger slices of bread."
5,Matchbox is best,"When my son, who is 4, saw this in a display case, he wanted to put it in the shopping cart so he could buy it. He immediately took a liking to it. So Santa brought him one for Christmas this year. It is a big hit.It is easy to assemble and LOTS of action fun. There's a big button the kids get to hit to send the car up to the top. What kid doesn't like to hit something? The next coolest thing, to me, is the carosel. The cars are lifted on the carosel to the top and then roll down the track. The carosel is battery powered, which makes it more fun for the kids. There's also a cannon that you can launch your car out of. That provides crashing action for your child. Then there is even the extra of trap doors that your child can operate.My son received two hotwheels tracks too, but they were not as easy to assemble nor as fun. One of them I wish we had left at the store.This toy is way cool! Matchbox has won my business from now on."
3,Loved!,"This story of a single mom learning how to let people in again was absolutely wonderful! As always, great strong characters developed by Nora Roberts!"
2,Outdated,"I was really stoked to buy this after reading all of these reviews... but if you're really interested in the subject I would go with something else. This is very outdated. Many of the ""tips"" don't really apply anymore. If you already consider yourself an avid thrift store shopper, this won't be new to you."
5,Enjoyable Reference,"This is a well-organized book that offers the history of and rules of play for many different kinds of games, indoors and out, with playing pieces and without. One of the many things I enjoy about this book is that you can flip through it and your eyes will be caught by a two-color illustration of some game, such as a card game, and you may think, ""Hmm, that looks interesting."" Then you read about the game and most likely play it."
5,LOVE THESE KNIVES!,"I use this knife for cutting everything! Yes, I said everything!It's so sharp that it glides through tomato's, cheese, olives, garlic, grapes, apples. You name it.I am giving this knife as a gift to everyone I know this year."
5,"Super sharp, super affordable","You can't beat the price - I purchased two of these. Super sharp, so sharp that I cut my thumb the first time using it! Easily handles any slicing job."
5,"Forschner / Victorinox Paring Knife, 3 1/4 in Straight,","Forschner / Victorinox Paring Knife, 3 1/4 in Straight, Small, Black Nylon Handle Model 40600I love this knife, I have several from this maker and not a bad word on any of them."
5,Works exactly as it should!,"This knife was recommended by ATK. I have enjoyed all of the tools I have purchased because of their recommendations. This knife is no exception. It is flexible, strong, and sharp. The handle is easy to grip and doesn't slip. I wish I had purchased two."
1,No Corn Flavor,A number of other reviewers said they didn't like the flavor. What flavor? It had almost none and if you are hoping for the flavor of corn you'll need to concentrate very hard to imagine it's there. If it was possible to give zero stars...
1,Really weird aftertaste,"I've made cornbread with this mix a few times now, and it comes out with a funky aftertaste every single time. It's so gross. I wouldn't buy this ever again. Just make your own mix. It's not hard at all."
5,Hard to believe it's Gluten-free!!,"I bought one bag of this at a local health food store and I LOVE IT!! It's so EASY to make, which is such a bonus for Gluten-free baking. It is incredibly moist and has a spongy texture (although some may not like that as it is a bit different than a traditional cornbread taste....) It's good Gluten-free cornbread. There's no other way to describe it."
2,It's ok,I just did not like the taste. I have used other GF corn bread mix that my family and I have enjoyed more. Wish I did not by a case.
5,Great music!,"I wish that there were more stars to give, this is the only cd that I permanently leave in my cd changer. I just think his voice is incredible and soothing. I listen to it SO much that this is my third copy I am purchasing. I have to get one for the car and one for the house. There is not one track that I don't love.Great from start to finish.What ever happened to him? I am fiending for some more of his beautiful music!"
5,Kevon's CD Is Great!,"'How often' do you get to listen to great music? Once you start listening to Kevon's album, you'll be listening to it '24/7'. His duet with Face is a work of art. You've done it again Kennith. Much props... I especially enjoy tracks #1 thru #9. This is a must for your CD collection. Too bad there's only a 5 star rating system 'cause I would of given it 10 stars. Peace...."
4,An R&B Record for Grown Ups.,"The r&b world might not have realized it, but it suffered a big loss when the vocal group After 7 broke up. They were the stellar r&b male vocal group Boyz II Men should have been, releasing albums of comtemporary, yet classic, soul that stood head and shoulders above much of their younger, MTV-friendly peers. Member Kevon Edmonds branches out into a solo career of his own, and pulls it off well with his debut. Impressively, the disc doesn't cower to trends or feature guest rappers. The spotlight belongs entirely to Edmonds, delivering suave mid-tempo grooves and tight ballads. ""Never Love You"" and ""A Girl Like You"" are pretty much standard Babyface fare, though Edmonds shines in ""Love Will Be Waiting"" and the title track. ""24/7"" is a fine album that manages to be old school without being old fashioned, and in the world of r&b, that's no mean feat."
5,Great Product,"I have used this in the mountains, on the bike trail and on the road and am very impressed with it."
3,Some doubts...,"I bougth this unit one month ago.I really like the color screen, the micro SD Card, and some functions.But I really have doubts: the reception is not good enough, if I lost reception I have to turn off the unit and turn on again to catch the satellite again. I lost reception very easy, if I am walking in a canyon, or inside a building. Also, when I just turn on the unit, It delays a lot if I was moving. For me It is a very basic GPS no maps preload, only the recreational maps, that's it.I read that the Garmin GPS 60CXs is much better."
2,Geocacher,"I purchased the Vista CX after wanting to upgrade from my Legend. The first out caching, the unit was very eradic and took me 400' feet from the cache. After calibrating the compass, I got within 80' feet. Second cache it got within 90' of it. Garmin CS said they never heard of this but the Vista I purchased two years did the same thing. They both were returned, needless to say. If you want a great no frills GPS, stick with the Legend. Most cachers with higher end Garmins fuss about the cords being off from lower end units. Garmin just can't see to make the expensive units with many features be accurate. The Vista line keeps building on a poor platform. I am waiting on my new Magellan Explorist 500 from Amazon."
5,MY BALLS,"MY BALLS WORK REAL WELL, THEY ARE DEFINATELY BETTER THAN ANY OTHER BALLS BECAUSE THEY ARE FASTER AND FEEL LESS FRAGILE AND ARE PROFESSIONAL. I DON'T KNOW, ARE THERE BETTER BALLS THAN MY BALLS?"
5,Butterfly makes great balls.,"I wasn't sure what to expect with these balls but within 10 minutes of playing with them, my doubts were dispelled. They bounce very evenly and true and have a very smooth feel. I definitely noticed a difference between these and the other couple brands I play with (Stiga and Joola)."
5,Solid balls,"These balls are solid. Quite expensive, but worth the pay. No irregular bouncing, and can withstand the most brutal smashes!"
4,Very informative read,Bought this for a friend with eye issues. He was happy with the book. Very informative and full of helpful information.
5,A Touching Movie...,"This is unlike any other Bollywood movie I have ever seen. At first I wasn't sure I would like it but I was glad to be wrong. It is a must see. I would say that the back and forth between time periods was a little confusing and I had to watch it a second time in order to follow the story line fully, but even slightly confused it was still wonderful. It's not even a movie that can be fully described, it is one that just needs to be watched. Laugh out loud, heart breaking, innocent, and pure sweetness to watch!"
1,These are how much???,"The rating is for the seller, not the product. I can pick these up at my local Home Depot for $5, $5!!!! You want to charge $12 + $6 shipping?? That is ridiculous!"
1,The Streets need to learn to read and write,"This latest musical contribution from one of England's burgeoning chav rappers epitomises everything that is wrong with English society today. With no evidence of a formal education or any original poetry in his work,the album floats in a sea of retarded sexuality and bad poetry. The fact that he has done so well is an alarming fact,the mainstream music audience of the UK has once again spoken for itself.There is very little musical invention from within in this album as the previous one, I highly recommend renting it from a CD library or listening to the free samples just to see how bad it actually is. I would rather spend that money on garden fertilizer. British hiphop is in a bad bad way..."
3,Good? Yes. Recommended? With hesitiation.,"The Streets (MC Mike Skinner) has a good amount of talent. His rhymes, while not always the most clever, are decent enough and you can get swept into certain songs with ease.As stated in my review of Dizzee Rascal, The Streets get a lot of indie (white hipster) acclaim but very little from the US rap/hip-hop community. This is mainly due to the difficulty in understanding the MC. UK rappers tend to use a lot of UK street lingo and most of the rhymes come at you at a furious pace - generally much faster than standard US rap. Skinner is talented but I'd say this CD doesn't live up to the crazy hype it's been receiving from the indie circle."
5,INCREDIBLE!!! BUY THIS ALBUM!,"All of the other reviews are dead on. The Streets are a breath of fresh air!! WOW! Incredible haunting melodies on ""Blinded By the Lights"" and absolutely up to the second as he sends SMS messages on his cell phone while looking for the girl! Some of these tunes have the soul-gripping power of ""Comfortably Numb"". I am going to tell everyone I know about this album!!"
1,You Call This Rap,"My friend is obsessed with this guy but I herd him and how can this guy be a rapper he has no flow and his lyrics are commical. All the dude does is talk through ever song this is not rap so whoever thinks this guy is a rapper needs to get an education in rap. Listin to Kanye West,Twista,The Game OR 50 cent who actually have some flow and can be considerd real Rap music not this british talking crud, and to think my firend says these are the most amazing beats hes ever herd which i WHOLEY DISAGREE the neptunes,Dre now those are beats these are laughable terrible rapper in my opinion"
2,Pesh!,"I was pretty disappointed with this album. I am a big fan of Original Pirate Material and thought it was refreshing to hear something that was a bit different from what we were getting in the states. I don?t think that anything was a step up from Skinner?s last album. The beats are pretty basic and the content of the lyrics remind me of a friend telling you a story that you have to try and will yourself not to tune out. The good spots of the album are the catchy ?Fit But You Know It?. The rest of the album is sappy, corny, and surprisingly, unlike its predecessor not very innovative.I know I shouldn?t compare this album to OPM, but you really can?t help it. I wasn?t expecting another OPM. I was expecting more. I guess that it goes to show that you can?t believe the hype. I?ve never heard an album that made me so bored by its subject matter that it made me want to get up and go do something else. Believe me I gave it a couple of goes, but I can?t make myself like this album."
2,Disappointed,I bought this book for the CD as I wanted a product that is interactive and where I could test my knowledge as claimed.The CD failed to install and I went on to contact info@pring.com (contact details provided on the Pring site). Had an email back asking if I was interested in trying their Beta version. I replied asking a few questions on how I can do this etc but never heard back.Thoroughly disappointed!!
3,so disappointed until...,"I used to go to Webster Hall in the late '80s and early '90s, when the 'boys room' parties were circuiting around Manhattan venues. So, I opted to buy this collection because of the price being so nil compared to the discs intact, five in all, and was disappointed by the 'straight' style of music being played....until I got to the last disc. It is worth the money for the last disc unto itself. I put that disc #5 on the spinner and could not believe the brilliant collection of 'boys room' sounds. a must for the collector."
5,One of the best fantasy books I have ever read,"I just finished the book and have been kicking myself for not reading it sooner! It is extremely well written with superb character development, great story flow and gut busting humor. Bazil and Relkin are better developed and more likable characters then any since Sam and Frodo. I am picky when it come to what fantasy books I read and this one is in my hall of fame. Read my ad; Buy This Book Now! You wont regret it."
5,Bazil is Beautiful!,"Want to escape to another world so thoroughly that time just slips away? Come with Bazil and his friends as they defend their world against all kinds of evils.Great characterizations, a unique SF imaginative vision, superb action writing style, and a touch of terran Napoleonic War history brought to another galaxy make the entire series a wonderful read. Not since Bernard Cornwell's Sharpe novels have I had such a great time going to war!It was Bazil who came to my rescue through a recent long illness. Many thanks, Christopher Rowley!"
4,"Tastes good, easy to make","This tastes rich, creamy, and smooth with just the right amount of caffeine kick I need in the morning. The only pitfalls would be high calorie content and some genetically modified ingredients thrown in."
1,Dirty,"This might have been a fun book if it had been more decent, but it just went too far. It deserves an R rating, and I find nothing at all amusing about that. I threw it in the trash before I was half done. And I won't pick up any more of Barry's fiction unless I have reason to believe it's no worse than a PG-13."
2,Must have a defective unit.,"I bought this radio because of the good reviews. I liked the digital tuning. It was very easy to lock on stations and the presets are also a nice feature. The sound quality was another story. Many of the other reviewers had commented on the very good sound quality, but the unit I bought sounded so bad that neither my wife, nor I could listen to it for more than a few minutes. Actually it sounded like what you would expect from such a small radio. I might have just purchased a defective unit. I just can't imagine how anyone could say my radio sounds very good or even ok. If you are thinking about buying one, check out the return policy. I sent mine back and I think I'm going to get hit with postage both ways plus a restocking fee. Ouch!"
2,Weather Radio Useless,"We live in a major hurricane area, so one of the main reasons I bought this radio was for the weather function. Because of our location we have two US Weather Bureau stations we can receive the weather warnings on. When I first got the radio I didn't think it could pick up the weather band at all. A while later when I happened to be standing in a specific location in the house, and held it at jusssst the right height and angle I could here faint, mostly unintelligible sounds come from it when on that band.It's useless as a weather radio unless you are on top of the broadcast station.It works OK for AM/FM but nothing to write to friends about."
3,Some improvements needed,"I bought this radio to be used in the office, so I was looking for somethig nice, headphones jack, slim, and tv reception.It has very good reception and I liked the design.But the big dissappointment was to realize it's not stereo so I only hear in one side of my headphones. The other issue is that you have to get the AC adapter wich is about $20."
2,Big battery-consumer,"The sound is fine, though by no means exceptional. It requires 3 batteries at one time and they run out very quickly. Also it's kind of bulky, not good to bring with."
3,"Great reception, decent sound, poor battery life","I bought this radio 6 months ago. I wanted a portable, digital radio that got good reception. That's what I got. And the sound, while not exciting, is decent for the size. What I didn't count on was that the battery life on this thing is pitiful. I wind up buying new batteries (AAA) about once a month. And since the thing takes 3 batteries, it's difficult to use rechargeable batteries (which you can only recharge in even numbers, not to mention the fact that they don't last as long). Sure, you could buy an ac adapter for another $15 or $20, but then you've killed the radio's mobility & reduced its reception.Overall, the radio does a great job, but it ends up being more of a hassle than a convenience. If I had it to do all over again, I'm not sure I would buy another one."
3,Good but could be improved,Lack of AC power supply and illuminated dial are minuses. Otherwise tuning and audio quality are great. I purchased an RCA universal AC power supply model AH5WH at home depot for$6.00 on clearance and it works fine with no static on lower bands at all.
3,Look elsewhere if you need Weatherband...,"I received this radio from amazon today and am happy with it except for the faulty Weatherband. (It's the tuner that's bad: all 7 weather channels tune to the same frequency, and none of them well, compared to my smaller, cheaper, older Radio Shack Weather Cube). Sony's technical support was of no help whatsoever, referring me to NOAA's frequency guide on the web. Weatherband shortcomings aside, the radio fits perfectly on a narrow ledge (like a window sill); the 3-inch speaker sounds great for its size, and the five presets per band are adequate for me. The TV channels perform well, too. ... But for $40 or less, it's a good value and performs well (except for the Weatherband, which could be a defect only in the radio I received). Made in China, by the way, not in Japan."
4,Purchased radio for hurricane weather reports,In preparation for the hurricane season I needed a battery operated weather station radio as electrical power during a hurricane is not reliable. The Sony ICF-M410V is capable of receiving weather reports from 7 channels. This meets and exceeds my requirements.
2,"Good Brand, Bad Sound Quality","I Recently purchased but returned an ICF-M410V radio because the sound reproduction is low tone and muffled. Increasing the volume just distorts the sound. For me the reason is that Sony no longer manufactures this products in Japan. I own 2 of the older versions of this radio, both made in Japan, and the overall quality was excellent; sound reproduction was crisp, clear and loud. A pity because new features in the ICF-M410V radio are good improvements to the product, like the shuttle tunning knob."
4,Just what I needed.,"I knew this radio before I ordered it, so I am not surprised to find it works well, doing what I need it to."
1,Embarrassing Gift,"I purchased this radio as a Christmas gift for a friend who wants a radio at work. I was embarrassed to find out that the radio gets absolutely no reception in any band. This is totally unacceptable, especially since it has the Sony Label."
4,Portable radio,"This is exactly what I was looking for, something slim, lightweight and powerful enough to use at the beach.It is all that!"
3,It's.... okay,"The hammer came dirty right out of the package and the finish is not good. The hammer had this dirt-like substance on it. The edges were not smooth at all. They sell for $3 at the student medical store here, so I don't understand why this one is so poorly made. I'm not sure if that is a seller issue or if all of these hammers are really that poorly constructed. That being said, I'm just a 1st year med student, so it will do."
5,Blown away!!!,"I think this is the perfect novel. What makes it so, is the way Justin Cronin turns a phrase. His words are lyrical - like poetry and you think - as you read - that he has exactly pinned down words to express emotions we have all felt. The story weaves in and out among the characters but Cronin is able to link them all up at the book's end. It is perfectly woven. I read this book with a pen in hand (great believer that books should be handled and even mishandled)because I somehow wanted to underscore how beautifully he described emotions and events. His characterizations feel true - you grow to like these people so much in the course of reading this book. I was amazed to see that Cronin is a very young man - he appears to have the wisdom and perspective of someone much older. I am looking forward to his writing in the future. Thanks for a great read, Justin Cronin!"
5,This is a rare gem!,"I have told almost everyone I know to read this book! It is magnificently written. There is a truly memorable page in the book that made me cry as Mr. Cronin describes ""man's best friend."" I really loved that he told the story from the various characters point of view. I didn't want the book to end and have been hoping that Mr. Cronin will have a new book out by 2007. I am glad that he doesn't churn out books 3 times a year, it makes it that much more special when his next one comes and that we all have something to look forward to."
5,Moving and meaningful,I loved the summer Guest. The character development was done in an interesting back and forth way. The book had many messages and the writing was well done from start to finish. I could not put it down.Parts of it brought tears to my eyes.
3,enjoyable read however historicaly flawed,"very good read,excitment and exploits bar none however this book is rather self serving.many of his deeds for which he claimed sole responsibility for have been debunked in the many years after this books 1st printing.none the less his deeds are impressive,even when watered down with the proven facts.this book is a good companion to the many others written about him but should not stand alone as the final word.all in all worth the price, but probobly a better read when the reader is a bit better grounded in the subject"
2,Pay Off,"While I did enjoy Stephen Leather's very English noir style, I think the whole time building up to the climax was drowned out by the very quick out come at the end. He spend a lot of effort planning and getting all the details right for revenge when it all started to fall into place it was all over. This is my second Leather book and I did enjoy his style and it hasn't put me off reading more of his book, I just won't be recommending this book as a starting point for this author."
3,it's still working but,"it was expensive considering what it is. Maybe I should have gone to a material shop to find something to cover the table with.I think the table cost $99 (of course I bought this 10 yrs ago) and this cover cost $66, so there is something out of whack here."
3,Works well with table folded but does not lay flat when table is open- does not last very long,"Nice cover and works well if table is folded but it does not work very well when the table is open. It won't lay flat on the table and corners easily blow up with wind. The color also faded in only a couple of weeks as it now has a pinkish hue to it. When the table is folded it is also a bit too wide, so overall not ideal. I ordered it because it was the only alternative are blue covers that are an eyesore. So in conclusion, it is more discreet than the bright blue covers but not very practical if you want to keep yout table in the open position.Update on 12/24/12. Two years later this covers is in self inflicted shreds. Rapid discoloeation continued all the way to a light gray Would not purchase again. Would change two two star review"
5,It's Gorgeous,This necklace exceeded my expectations. The stones were beautiful and looked so real. It looked very pretty on me and was a nice complement to my navy dress.
2,Original title; books lacks originality,"I thought the authors premise was well meant but book lacks originality. It was like reading a summary of various works of the self imporvement field. The book had no clear flow of ideas and was disguised in endless referrals to others. What I got out from the book was that the references inspired me to read from the other authors / distinguished self improvement mentors.What I did like was his preparation for speeches. Unfortunately the endless references to Anthony Robbins were a turn off. I have read most of Robbins which do inspire and have many good ideas but one just has to look at his personal life and figur out that he is just as human as us. The book,I felt, book was bordering idol worship...What I would do is go to [a book store], browse through the index of references and go and read the original works."
4,"Not quite as good as the Olympus ME-51S, but still a good Mic","I tired both the Sony and the Olympus ME-51S with my GoPro Hero2. Both, performed well in my audio tests (though not as good as the on-board mic). I felt the Olympus did a slightly better job picking up speech and ambient sounds. For non-powered Mics both are good choices, but I would lean toward the Olympus all things considered. I would also note there are ""fake"" Sony ECM-DS70P microphones being sold on the market. There is a YouTube video that illustrates the differences between the genuine and fake Sony mics. I noticed many of the fake Mics being sold on Ebay for under $15.00 (Buyer Beware)."
4,Only Practical Solution for Any Type of Personal Stereo Recorder,"This is the only mic that is practical for use with my (apparently discontinued) Panasonic stereo cassette recorder (the onboard mic is monaural). Ignore the cord and simply attach the mic directly to the machine for a package that is scarcely any larger, heavier or less convenient than the original machine. Surprisingly, Panasonic offers no mic for the recorder, even though it's seen at least two editions. With the cassette machine I notice no improvement in sound quality with the higher-priced, stick-shaped Sony stereo mic.Having had a couple of misfires with a digital mini-recorder (admittedly not ""mechanical"" breakdowns), I'd still recommend a cassette machine, if only for a back-up."
4,Clandestine delight,"I've been using mine with excellent results for 4 years now. I find the stereo separation acceptable under most circumstances. I use Sony MZ R700, R900, and MZ N1, and I can't tell one from the others under most recordings. It CAN be overloaded/distorted, but I've only found that in cases of really bad room acoustics and loud enough to be uncomfortable and distort even my listening. I've never been caught, as the whole rig can be set to ""all green but hold final count"" status before entering the venue, and then easily hidden as intermission lights come up. Only complaints are that there is no (known) windscreen available, and the clip is not really up to the task, and easily lost. I made a replacement with a paper clip and an alligator clip. Elsewise, this mike has been the single consistent tool in my mission to preserve live music shows. All of which are folk & alt.country."
2,Build quality is really bad,"This mic I bought was sold by Amazon.com; it is a genuine SONY product manufactured in Japan rather than those fake ones sold on eBay.At the first glimpse, this mic looked OK. However, I feel really bad when I touched it. It was all plastic and the assembly was so loose. The neck can be bent 90, but the whole structure was so weak. It is easy to over bend it; if one is not careful, s/he could easily break it. Just imagine that it is all loosely assembled plastic...I also tested the sound, not as good as the internal mic of my Sony ICD-AX412 digital voice recorder.I will not recommend my friends to buy this mic; it does not worth the price."
3,ONLY for Plug in power devices,"FYI - This mic requires devices with plug in power capability, so only certain devices / uses will work. Check the manual PDF for info. (3 stars because I have to give a rating but haven't used it - I'm just warning others)"
2,Disappointed,"I've used this DVD player about 4 times and I'm already having problems. The DVDs just stop for no reason. Also, I wish I knew the battery pack stuck out the back of the player opposed to fitting directly underneath. Also, if you purchase any DVD player for travel I highly recommend a carrying case! The players are very fragile."
1,Dr. Phil was wrong on this.,"This book is an overly tragic telling of an all too common problem. It was amatuerish to the point where I had to force myself to get through it so I could finish it. Somehow, even though infidelity is terrible, the story came across as obvious and boring. It was full of details that turned into filler for a basic story. I got it upon Dr. Phil's recommendation and don't agree that it is worth reading. Definitely not worth $20+ for it."
4,Farberware FCJ300P Citrus Juicer,WE HAVE BEEN USING THE JUICER FOR 3 WEEKSIT WORKS FINE ONLY SUJUSTION THAT FUTURE MODELS HAVE A LOCK TO STOP THE JUICE JUG FROM MOVING IN USEALL PARTS SEEM WELL MADE(...)
1,Heart concerns? Stay away from this one.,"If you have heart problems, stay away from this one!! After taking it for little more than a week, I was hospitalized for atrial fibrillation. No serious damage to my heart, but the co-pay on the bill was substantial. to be fair, this product did NOT cause the afib as it was a preexisting condition.Quinine is the cause of the problem but quinine is used to fight malaria. btw, I still experienced leg cramps."
3,OK,Good for someone with no knowledge at all about the subject. Not very much help for passing the exam for a license.
5,Love it.,I love the 'For Dummies' series. This is the ONLY one that I have read from cover to cover and enjoyed every bit of it. Thank you Ward for writing such an informational book for newly licensed hams.
3,Incompatible- Beware,"This product received good reviews, but it would not work with my 2007 Toyota. Seems more car markers have proprietary radios that don't allow add-on disc players. Before you order, do some research to determine if you can use this item in your newer car."
1,"new versions, years later by original artists","It says in small print on the CD box ""New sterio recordings by the original artists.""For practical purposes its a ripoff. But the one song I wanted on here, Moonlight Feels Right, was original, I think, or else it sounded close. But the rest of them sucked, although I think they are by the original artists. I think some of you out there may want to buy it just to hear alt takes of your favorites. But for most of you it is a ripoff."
2,below average,"A friend of mine let me borrow this CD after constantly praising it as the best album he heard in a while. I gave it about 6 spins before deciding that it was pretty much the same generic stuff many other bands make (except they all do it much better). If your a long time fan or something you'll probably find something to like, but if otherwise you should definitely pass.On a side note, whats with this band trying to become famous after punching Glenn Danzig? I guess you gotta do whatever you can to get your name out there when your albums are weak."
4,nuns of st archangel,good nun exploitation movie. good study of the exploitation of women and power manipulation within the church
1,Completely failed.,"This item worked great for about 6 months. Then while driving in cold weather one of the clamps broke on the cooler. Unbeknownst to me the transmission fluid seeped out and my car stuttered to a stop. I repaired it and refilled the fluid, and the car worked for about 200 miles then the transmission completely stopped working.I would either recommend a better kit, or simply buy higher quality clamps. I have replaced the transmission but I now use two better quality clamps on each fitting instead of one cheap chinese clamp like in this kit.Don't skimp on a kit like this when your transmission is at stake."
1,Save money - get a copy of the Constitution and read instead,"Save your money and get a copy of the Constitution for the United States. There is nothing new in this book for anyone who has spent a little time studying the Constitution. The book would benefit from greater inclusion of historical and factual information. Some of the discussions on various sections and amendments are abrupt and lack definitive supporting documentation. For a book on the Constitution, the list of readings at the end should be more inclusive of the major writings from the 18th and early 19th centuries.On another note, the construction of the book was poor. A number of pages in my copy were loose and close to falling out."
1,Swashbuckling Duke,"""The Man From Monterey"" (1933) remains a deadly dull John Wayne vehicle, with unfunny comic relief and precious little action. Still learning the ropes, a youthful Duke proves he's no Errol Flynn in a poorly staged sword fight. Easily the worst of Wayne's six Westerns for Warner/Vitagraph."
5,Hard To Find,"Very good coffee, my personal favorite....Please get more of it. Why is it no longer available????"
1,Not Mocha Fusion Latte mix!,This is a poor substiute for Mocha Latte. It takes like water and has no body or flavor! Bring back the Latte!
1,Don't waste your money,This book has nothing more in it and much less information that you can find for free on line. I have several books on crocheting - all cost less than this one and all have much more information than this one. I also have DVDs for crocheting which are even better than the books. I sent this book back.
2,Really IS and Encyclopedia,"For the record, let me state that I've been surfing for 20 years and got the bug, along with most others my age, watching The Endless Summer and getting captivated by the energy and beauty of the sport. This compilation, while very complete, really IS an encyclopedia...page, after page, after page. There are some useful tidbits of information strewn among the lengthy volume but a large majority of the book seems filled with fairly uninteresting, small, black and white photos, and biographies of just about anyone in the world who ever attempted to stand up on a board. Avoid this snore-fest and put your money into a nice hardcover coffee table book filled with glorious color shots of the world's tube riders...and leave all of the trivia to the wannabes."
3,How do you get the orginal cast recording?,"I am a huge fan of the song ""In a Simple Way I Love You"" and have been looking for a recording of the song. Does anyone know where I could possibly get an original recording of that song? The new one isn't the one I am looking for! Can anyone help?"
2,Quite a Disappointment,"I bought this item after searching for quite some time to find a copy of the original off-Broadway cast album. While anticipating that this version would differ from the album I really wanted, I was rather dismayed to find that it is in all respects quite inferior. In my mind, the main problem lies with the choice of Diane Langton for the female lead. Her voice, while pleasant enough, is a poor substitute for Gretchen Cryer's. Add to that some questionable directorial choices (the a capella version of ""Lonely Lady"") and you have a less-than-mediocre product."
2,Bring back the original,"I also have worn out my original version of this wonderful recording, the current version is average, but cannot compete with the original. Please bring the original recording back and make it available for purchase, Ill be ordering it the second it shows up."
1,Cryer-ing for the Original,"After unsuccessfully locating the original of this wonderful show, I had to settle for this import. And settle I have - Oh where oh where is the original cast recording when you need it? For anyone who had seen this on Broadway, this is a real disappointment. I wanted so much to love it as much as the worn out vinyl copy."
1,Lacks the edge of the Original Off-Broadway album.,"The London cast album of ""I'm Getting My Act Together..."" simply lacks the poignant punch of the Gretchen Cryer original from Columbia Records. Gretchen MADE the show, as it was coming from her own personal experiences. The singer on the London CD just doesn't ring true."
3,MTBF - 6000 hours,Used 2 for a laptop cooling stand and both have started to make random noises in less than 6000 hours of operation.If you can fit a Panaflo for your particular job buy it instead.
4,I WILL BRING YOU TO LIFE!!!,"I got mine a few weeks ago. So far, so good. Have had no problem with the said product whatsoever. I think the company could of made a few design changes just improve the durability of the cord connecting the power supply box [step down transformer?] just to make it less vulnerable to pinching in the future [just to avoid the potential of having to replace this product sometime down the road. But suppose as long as you treat this product with a little r-e-s-p-e-c-ttttt! you should have no worries about that. But all of that aside, if you need juice this box is the fruit. Squeeze away!!!"
3,Not recommended as a first book,"There is some good information in this ""pamplet"" but I was disappointed that it turned out to be more of a list with very little narrative. If you already have a good understanding of this subject then it might prove to be a handy tool for additional information."
4,great concepts behind the photos..,"At first glance, as someone who prefers open space to crowded rooms, the photographed apartments in this book appeared busy, and often gaudy. However, when I actually read it, I understood the subtle concepts behind the design choices. So while I would not personally chose to mix leopard print, neon pink, and baroque furniture in a small space, I understand what the owners were going for. (And I actually took a liking to that room. It has a lot of personality!) In the end, this book inspired me to rethink my entire living space! I am usually a visual person who prefers photo inspiration to text. But in this case, it was the little bits of writing and advice that sparked my creativity.I'd recommend it to anyone with a sense of fun about their living space, or anyone willing to look a little deeper than the photos. :)"
4,Very Informative Guide Book,"This book describes the many day hikes available at Glacier National Park in Montana. It provides very descriptive information about the hikes and gives a total distance as well as fitness level guidance for those who love to hike. I am glad I purchased this book as we will have some time to hike and don't want to miss out on any of the wonders that Glacier National Park has to offer. It is only a hiking book and does not offer any insights as to lodging, or restaurants but it is what I was seeking."
4,Anxious to give it a try,"I have read the book through, but haven't had the opportunity to test it out. It has been 7 years since I have been to the park and from my personal past reference, I believe I will enjoy using this book on my next trip.If you don't already have a book for day hikes, I would highly recommend this book just by reading it."
3,okay product,This product doesn't condition enough. But it does give the hair a slightly lightened effect.
4,Worth $...!!!!,"With a 20"" viewing area, I have no problem viewing massive CAD programs on my PC. The only problem I have is a slight haziness on the corners of the PC that can cause strain to ones eyes. This is the only reason it didn't get a perfect rating. However, it can be almost completely resolved by keeping it at the default resolution (1600x1200). Get the monitor. You won't be sorry."
3,School of Tomorrow literature book,if you student of School of TomorrowYou need to read this bookcause this book is one of literature book for SOT curriculum.
3,Boardbook is a condensed version,"I purchase the hardcover edition of this book, however Amazon sent the board book version. The board book version is not a complete version."
5,Amazing book!,I worked in a daycare for three years and the kids loved this book! The text is great and lyrical and the illustrations are beautiful. I recently bought this for my niece and she loves it!
2,Not What I Expected,"I was expecting a clear, thin sheet or strip of plastic to protect the sides of the car in parking lots, for example. I expected that it could be left on the car and that you could drive with it on, rather than having to take it off and put it on each time you park. This door guard is thick, and not wide enough (unless you know exactly where the door of the car parking next to you is going to impact your door). Two little suction cups, one on each end, do not hold the ""door guard"" on over night, even with a freshly washed car door. You cannot drive with them on, obviously."
2,Not worth buying,"I was more interested in technique and tips for cooking with my new convection oven and this was a poor resource The recipes are ordinary. Personally, I wouldn't have bought it had I known how mediocre this book was."
2,Not enough information,As there are very few convection oven cooking cook books available I sadly took a chance on this one. It did not provide me with the basic information I was looking for... how to adjust my baking for the convection oven coking mode that came with my new stove. This book appears to be more for the countertop convection oven. The recipies were mediocre at best and many were stew type cooked in a covered casserole. The recipies do list the ingredients in order of use which is nice. There are other books out there that are much better for learning how to cook in a convection oven - I'd suggest that you skip this one.
3,$19.99 and 4 for 3 promo,"At its full extension, this rod is just long enough. I would normally order the next larger size to give myself some leeway but the price after promo decided upon this option for me. This replaces a 1970s white u-rod. I already have Umbra rings in brass that I will not be replacing. The black and brass will match the Ikea black lamp with the brass detail next to the window. I'm happy with this sales purchase."
4,"Rich, Warm, Well-Polished","John Surman has made some interesting recordings over the years, but this CD with John Warren may well be his best ever. Surman plays soprano and baritone sax, alto and bass clarinet, and piano on this recording, fronting a brass choir comprising three trumpets, two trombones, and two bass trombones, supported by bass and drums, all under the direction of conductor John Warren. The musical textures that result are rich and rewarding, with Surman's reeds alternately dancing above and then blending right in with the brass. Rich, warm, well polished instruments playing rich, warm, well-polished music in rich, warm, well-polished sound. NOTE: I am reviewing the CD, not the MP3 version, which probably has less dynamic sound."
1,Sony VAIO Standard Lithium-Ion Battery (PCGA-BP71A),The battery which I received was not a Sony Battery. It was manufactured by a third party and did not fit well in the battery slot. The battery was not able to be charged in my laptop. The battery was returned to the seller.
2,Awfully Expensive & bad,"I purchased my Sony VAIO PCG-FX250 on September 2001, and let me tell you that I became dissapointed with it a long time ago. First thing that failed in my VAIO was the Diskette Drive before ending the first year, a few months later it was the CD-DVD/RW unit; I had to replace it, my power adaptor also had to be fixed about a year ago, and finally, my battery went belly up a couple of months ago. Now that I'm looking for a replacement I found that is awfully expensive which I don't justify, besides not being a reliable item, it doesn't even last more than a couple of hours when new.To make a long story short, the VAIO computers and accesories have goood looks, but for a device that costed me a little more than two grand at that time, I expected a much more reliable device. My next laptop won't be a SONY VAIO."
1,Battery Bummer,"I guess I feel comforted reading all these terrible reviews. My Vaio battery went kaput (after a couple of years, admittedly), and I bought two third party brand batteries, seemingly reputable. The first one worked for about a year. The one I just got worked for about a week and now it won't even take a charge! Zero! This after spending about $350 just before that to fix the software in the thing when it stopped booting up... surprise! I could have bought a new Dell, dude, for about $100 more. Like I'm going to go out now and pour more money into this machine for another battery? And forget Sony Customer service. Worthless."
4,A good book for students who are studying American History,"The book ""Pike McAllister"" helps to bring alive the history of the United States during the Civil War. It combines elements of slavery, the Underground Railroad, relationships between slave owners and their slaves, and family values. This would be excellent reading for students who may be studying the Civil War in American History."
4,Primary source material for Newman,"Although this book is quite pricey, as have been other recent OUP releases, this volume of Newman's Letters and Diaries is critical for seeing JHN at a critical time of his Anglican career. Here, Newman seems almost surprised by the reception of Tract 90 and it is also apparent that the Jerusalem Bishopric affair was one of the critical blows to his loss of faith in the via media. Some biographies may give us a glimpse at what was happening at the time, but here we can read Newman as he was living through it, without the benefit of hindsight."
4,"I am ordering this kit to build ""RUN-IN"" sheds for our horses.",I am hoping that this kit will help me to put up run-in sheds for our horses. I don't have to worry about a door! Thank goodness. I like the fact I don't have to cut anything! My hubby is going on deployment for 7 months so this will help me put up the sheds with the help of our barn manager. I will diffently let ya know how it goes!
2,Paper weights,"I bought a couple of these so my teens could build a couple of things and hopefully learn some very basic building skills. But these things are just a bunch of metal pieces that you have to put together and NOT bracket you simply slip 2x4's into. In the end it was easier to teach them just basic angle cuts, which is what I should of done in the first place. The instructions are actually more confusing than just looking at a shed and figuring it out."
4,Small and functional,"I wanted wood backing to blend and look better, but you really do not see these once the guitar is on the wall. They are small and the hanger itself is the perfect color to blend into the head of the guitar."
5,A good solid guitar hanger,"The hanger came with good quality drywall anchors which I needed because I wasn't lined up on a wall stud. It took maybe 5 minutes to put it up, and it holds the guitar firmly in place. It does hang maybe 6 inches out from the wall, so be aware. Overall a great item at a great price."
4,Good Hanger; Bad Screw,"This is a good, basic wall mount.Just be aware that the large plastic drywall anchors included aren't very sturdy: one of them broke as I was screwing it into my wall. I was able to rip off the broken bit of anchor and insert the screws to hang the mount anyway, but you may want to invest a few cents at the local hardware store in your own, sturdier anchors.The guitar mount itself is unobtrusive and does its job well."
4,Great Product,I bought 1 hanger for my husband's Acustic Guitar. It worked out great. Turned around and bought a second 1 for his electric Guitar. Guitar's look great hanging on the wall with this hanger. Definatley was not disappointed.
2,disappointing colors,"Like everyone else here, I ordered two of these understanding the ""shades may vary"" and I got one that is honey colored and another that is mahogany. Sad, sad, sad that a person shipping these couldn't at least grab two that remotely looked similar. I don't want to return one since I don't know what color the replacement will be. I'm just hoping the headstock on the basses will cover the color and not look too tacky on the wall side by side."
5,I have used String Swing Hangers for years,"The only hangers I use and don't think twice about hanging a $15,000 guitar knowing it will be safe and secure. When the mood strikes to play, there's a difference between getting out a case from the closet, opening it up, taking out the guitar; or just reaching up and start playing. Plus, keeping the guitars hung in this manner help keep the necks straight and the guitars at room temperature; love this product! (Edited to reflect String Swing Hangers as a five-star product)"
1,would not reccomend,"The anchors are just about impossible to install. It makes your guitar hang about 4in off of the wall so it looks weird like its floating; I wanted it up against the wall as much as possible. Also, if your guitar is a classical or has a wide neck, you will need to bend it with whatever you can to make it fit, and even then it will make your guitar hang in a really weird way. I would reccomend paying an extra $5-10 for a better looking one."
4,Works well enough,"I was a bit concerned because this is the cheapest hanger on amazon, but i was pleasantly surprised. Bought two to hang my ukuleles. Works well enough, but be warned, if you have tension tuners (Tuners that stick out the back, instead of the sides) they may get in the way. I had to use the hanger upside down, so it curved up instead of down; other than that no complaints. Be warned if you live in a dry area, your instruments WILL dry out unless you control the humidity in the room. Four out of five because it didn't adjust up and down, just by width."
5,Would definitely purchase again!!!,"This item was shipped promptly, arrived well and easy to put up. Had it up in less than 2 minutes. I used a stud finder and a phillips screw driver. VERY EASY"
5,excellant,"works as expected. No issues or suprises. Vendor was fast, and was a pleasure to work with. I would buy this product agian, and use the same vendor."
4,Standard Hanging Bracket for a guitar,"I've got this one in the living room so that my toddler grand daughter can't reach it. I've got a Les Paul hanging from it (screwed into a wall stud) so it'll handle a heavy guitar. This bracket has two screws and the Y hook. I've got these with a number of different brands on them including a Martin but they are all the same, hardwood block with a threaded metal insert for the hook. It's secure and unobtrusive. A guitar that's hidden away in the case doesn't get used. I need all the practice I can get. :-)"
4,"Good for Guitars, but not Banjos.","Works beautifully with my guitar- nice and sturdy, keeps it away from the wall, etc.However, it doesn't work that well with my banjo. I guess the head is too narrow and the weight rests on the tuners. It's a bit unnerving. I guess I should have bought one specifically for it....Anyway, it's a great guitar hanger at an excellent price. Buy one!"
5,"Works fine, looks good","I'm not qualified to comment on how secure the included screws and anchors are for hanging a heavy guitar on drywall, but I just didn't want to risk it. I used my own long deck screws and made sure they went well into the studs."
1,Insane,Make sure you buy this book if you want indoctrinate your children. The idea of man existing at the same time as dinosaurs goes beyond preposterous. Even reasonable religious leaders don't believe that the stories of Adam and Eve and Noah's Ark are true. WAKE UP!!!
2,Yuk.,"I recently tried Mama Mio ""Mama Mio Kit), which contains 5 mini products, and this balm was 1 of them. Ii is very emollient and good for very dry skin, but I don't care for it. It smells like old castor oil and pure shea butter is much better.Anyway I also tried belli and Mustela trial kits, and the winner is by far Mustela-consistency, scent, a little goes long way and absorbs very fast, skin feels nourish and moisturized for a long time."
5,Very nice net,"Really a solid net. Seem to be very high quality, and I like how big the surface points are that hold onto the table."
1,Missing parts,"I received the cart in a timely manner, but when I went to assemble it, one part was missing. Part D, the front axle, was not included. I've been searching for a customer service email or some way to contact you regarding the replacement part, but can't find anything on the website. Please let me know how to get it replaced. Thank you."
2,I would not recommend this book....,"I would not recommend this book....Mothers-in-Law and Daughters-in-Law: Love, Hate, Rivalry and Reconciliation.....I donated it to the library!~I bought several books with this theme...."
1,Two in a row bad,I've now had 2 in a row of these go bad .. first one failed after no less than 30 minutes .. its replacement only lasted 24 hours. I had one of the same brand before that lasted for 1.5 years (if not more).
3,It was alright...,"The movie was good to watch. Gay artist has lost his muse and finds it in his one of his bosses who happens to be a straight male (well not anymore) and is married to his other boss. Tragic love story which although has played out in many movies, I've seen played out in real life as well. The actors weren't exactly Oscar quality, but entertaining overall."
2,Selfish gay guy ruins a marriage,"The boys are cute, the filmaking OK, sex scenes hot....but once again the gay guy ruins lives... seduces a married man and thinks nothing of the wife or her feelings. All end up miserable....not a message I would hope for- no good comes of this affair."
2,Repetitive,"If you like the classic Rampage games then you'll love this one. They took Rampage to a higher level. It has some 3D look to it. Still not allowing you to Free Roam through a city like War of the Monsters does though, but it plays like the classics. Which is exactly what it was made to do. There are also 30 different monsters in the game. This is a great game to play and let out your rage. Why destroy something small in your house when you can put in Rampage and take out a whole city? I am a fan of the old Rampage games so I myself really enjoy this game."
4,High School Record,"I saw this film few days ago, it's sort of a Mockumentary film.. did enjoy it alot. loved the camera shots and the editing.great film,, makes me wanna go back to school.go and get it!!"
1,BMW Series 3 1975-1992 Motor Racing Publications Collectors Series,"This book is not the book it says it is. I bought it for my 14 year old son for Christmas, when he looked at it the entire book was about E-Type Jaguars and written by a completely different author than the one on the front cover. The cover is the only mention of BMW 3-Series."
4,Attending to Sorrow,"Your child died or your spouse left you. Your parent abandoned you. Your kids are ""disconnected."" Grief has many faces. Stephen Levine's book was recommended by a counselor I recently saw due to some personal grief issues.There are times I got lost in the read, but this was due to the sometimes poetic nature of the writer. I just keep reading and learned about breathing, tapping, mindfulness and forgiveness. Interspersed are tidbits of wisdom from Buddhist philosophy. All positive ways to embrace your life.This books isn't written to take your pain away. Rather, it helps you to embrace your human-ness. It affirmed my belief that the inability to feel empathy, hurt and pain, is -- apathy. I prefer being human and Stephen Levine wraps you in that comfort."
3,"Hard and bangin', good mixing, no soul","This is a good filler CD into your collection of Dieselboy and Alliance and the like. The mixing is good, technically strong but there are some odd decisions for which parts of the tracks to mix into and out of. There is usually a point wherein the mix becomes really fluid and momentum builds, however this record doesn't have that. It's a good collection of a bunch of good tracks, but it never reveals its soul like other mixes can. I attribute this to odd mix-in/out points. Overall, there's nothing especially *wrong* with this one, its just not a top ten for me."
4,We Can Enjoy Our Audience in Person,"We writers are naturally introverts, shy, thoughtful, contemplative. We can get comfortable being alone at our keyboard and with our own thoughts. But we need to relate to our audience, promote our work, go to book signings, go to meet the author day at school, and teach classes. In The Shy Writer: An Introverts Guide to Writing Success, C. Hope Clark makes us realize there are positive sides to being shy. Shy people fulfill a necessary place in this world. We would never want to change who we are. Hope helps writers by giving many tricks we can use and find out what works best for tie unique people we are."
4,"1,000 Mexican Recipes",Tried this book while in Mexico and made a delicious pork stew. I bought it for myself and a friend that loves to cook.
2,"It works, but the gas is horrible","I suffer from occasional problems with being regular, so I've been enjoying the yogurt which works fine. I wanted to get rid of the calories, so I tried this.There's no doubt that it works, but THE GAS is horrible. This is my 10th day and it has NOT gone away. I'm giving it only 12 days, then I have to quit because it's just awful.The product does work, but the side effects...yikes!"
3,Not sure...,"I have been taking this product for about 3 months at the recommendation of my doctor. I did not see any changes with my digestion, so I don't know if it has made any difference or not. I have stopped taking it, but I will give it the benefit of a doubt that it actually did something. For the price, I can't complain too much."
2,difference,"used sustenex for over a month now. I feel no different than I did the first day. This, for me, was a waste of money."
5,Sustenex saved me...,I've been taking sustenex for 2 years (since July 2008) and I will be on Sustenex for the rest of my life. It has made me whole again after years of intestinal/digestive issues that were beginning to ruin my life. I love this product.
2,"Sadly we were another ""miss"" in the Probiotic hit-or-miss","My husband has a very sensitive stomach, and has had digestive issues most of his life, so when I saw the chance to try this out I thought maybe it would be helpful for him. He dislikes many of the dairy products that contain probiotics (yogurt, cottage cheese and string cheese to name a few) so this seemed like the perfect opportunity for him to try probiotics.Unfortunately, he hasn't noticed any change in his digestive health or sensitivities to foods. He still reported the same heartburn and upset stomachs as before. I don't think we'll bother with probiotics for him again."
5,Used for several years and seems to work well,Recommended by our doctor to take some sort of probiotic... works much better than those nasty yogurts and is in a convenient pill form. Tied several other brands but this one seems to be the best.
2,Upset stomach,"It was on a whim that I decided to try Sustenex. Oh boy, my muse was off duty that day.I tried Sustenex for two weeks or so and I'm sorry to report I had to stop using it. My constitution did not respond well. Lots of gas, upset stomach, acid reflux, and so on--these were a few of the problems I ran into, dead center.I eat quite a bit of fiber, as I read one does need to do that with probiotics. It didn't seem to help. I'm glad it worked for others, but I'm staying away from Sustenex."
3,Good to combat Antibiotics?,"I have yet to try this product, but am currently taking a heavy duty antibiotic to combat a chronic sinus infection. Since antibiotics can kill all the healthy bacteria in the intestines, I am considering trying this product (as I'm not the biggest fan of yogurt). I've seen some negative reviews of this product and wonder a few things: 1) Are there alternatives to this product? and 2) Does this pill have to be taken once a day or can it be taken once a week? I would prefer a product that will be beneficial even if only taken once a week while I am taking an antibiotic."
4,Better than yogurt,"I've had stomach issues for the last 2 years and have yet to figure out what to do to help. I have experienced a lot of bloating and gas every time I eat, and I also get a lot of stomach pain. My doctor recommended water and fiber but that alone was not enough for me. I started eating Activia for the probiotics and it actually helped me quite a bit. However, I absolutely hate yogurt. I decided instead of trying to choke that down every day to try these probiotics. I have had good experiences with Schiff products for gas, and these were reasonably priced compared to the competition. I've only taken it for a couple of days now but I can already see a difference. The first day I had a lot more gas than usual, but it was wonderful to have it be released rather than pent up like it usually is, causing my bloating. I am really hoping that these positive effects continue. So far I am very happy. So much better than eating yogurt every day."
5,Fast shipping!,Great deal and shipped faster than any other online company I've ever used. Ink quality is consistently good! I'll be back!
1,printable not wearable,"My first black and color cartridge was fine and worked okay (did run out of ink slightly faster than I anticipated). When I opened the next black cartridge package ink poured out of package and all over my shirt and jeans. The same happened with the next color cartridge. I have seen better deals, but I figured you get what you pay for. Not in this case. It cost me the price of this product and two pairs of jeans and two shirts. Not really worth it."
2,Poor design.,"This rolling pin was clumsy and awkward to use. It was heavier than I expected, and I struggled to roll out my dough evenly. It is very difficult to wash - the roller part isn't completely sealed to the handles (this is so it call roll across the dough, I guess) which means that if you leave it to soak in water, liquid will fall into the gaps and then collect inside the roller. Once this liquid collects, it is very very difficult to remove. I noticed this had happened to my roller when I noticed a disgusting orange liquid was coming out of the edges whilst I was rolling my dough. Suffice to say, my pastry was ruined and I fear, so is my rolling pin. Take care when washing this product. Also, because the roller and the handles aren't sealed together, the roller makes a lot of noisy clanking noises when being used. I find that the handles seem to jiggle back and forwards when I am rolling my pastry out, which also makes this product annoying to use."
2,"Interesting idea, porrly executed","I read this book after reading a number of glowing reviews here and elsewhere. I can't say I didn't enjoy it, but the writer could stand to learn a few more speech patterns. All the characters, whether younger, older, drugged up, straight, cop, psychopath, etc... all spoke the same way. The ""hip"" dialogue was over the top at best and juvenile at worst. I found myself rolling my eyes several times. Very distracting. Sounds like Teran's seen too many independent films and was trying to write in order to be adapted."
1,Is Knopf desperate for sales??,"Or is Boston Teran related to the editor-in-chief? I can't think of any other reasons that a prestigious literary house would publish such dreck. Egregiously clunky prose, sentence fragments, and tv-movie dialogue abound. (Was this book copyedited? It's hard to tell.) The bad guys, moreover, are stock characters one and all. They have all the requisite signifiers: tattoos, spiky or no hair, drug use, leather clothing, etc. Admittedly, I did want to find out what happens, but only in the same way one wants to find out what happens when you round the corner to your block and find out that there are firemen standing around in front of the house next door."
2,Stick with the masters.,"Simply the latest installment in a lengthy series of average-to-absurd Chandler/Thompson/Burke wannabes. Lots of gore cannot subsitute for rich, gritty prose. Guns and violence do not make a hard-boiled novel. Atmosphere does. This book lacks any nuance to give it credibility. Too bad his talent doesn't match his ambition."
2,Interesting raw material in dire need of editing,"I don't mind music that stretches my attention span. After a few listens, it might even grow on me. I might detect new subtleties that bring color to what seemed like a bleak landscape at first. Laibach demands that kind of long-term relationship from the listener. However, there's a difference between daring minimalism and simple laziness. This album may have interesting moments, but the moments are not fused into interesting songs. It's a good novel that skipped the editing stage and sailed directly to the bookshelf. Furthermore, the endearing croak of Laibach's lead singer is absent, further alienating a Laibach stalwart like me. Oh well. I listen to this one in the background when I'm cooking sometimes. I stop clanging the dishes when I know a good passage is coming. I wouldn't even consider using other Laibach stuff as ""background"" music."
2,Cost-saving with problem,Non-latex masks are hard to find. The cost is reasonable and the large quantity is great. The problem is that the elastic on most of the masks snaps off after very little use. I've tried stapling and taping but nothing holds. Not recommended.
2,Doesn't live up to the standard of the original or BG2.,"This was one of the more expensive expansion packs I've ever seen, but sadly, it was also one of the shortest. Though the story of the game is okay, there is really not much new for this, other then the graphical enhancements made in Baldur's Gate 2 that they back ported to IWD. The new monsters (actually new, not old ones with a new skin) can be counted on one hand, and other then one of them - the final boss, they are kind of boring. Unless you have money to burn, this game should be passed on..."
3,This is the most Expensive John Wayne Movie I have ever bought because of the postage which was outrageous!!!,I thought this movie is might have been different to some of his others. I think if you are a John Wayne fan as I am then you might like mto have it in your collection as I now have.
5,Humor at its best!,"If you want to laugh until you cry, then read this book! Phillip Done captures all the joys of teaching and expresses it in a way that is hilarious. As I tried to share passages with my family, I couldn't get it out because I was laughing so hard. Anyone who has taught or is starting their first year of teaching should definitely read this. You will be truly inspired!"
4,All styles of Italian Cuisines from North to South,"This book has been around in numerous forms for many, many years and is well known throughout Italy as the quintessential cookbook of classic recipes.The book works its way methodically through the many courses that make up a variety of regional meals throughout italy.From antipastos, to entrees, mains and desserts, there is a diverse variety of ideas and suggestions to stimulate and inspire people looking to prepare an authentic meal.The recipes range from simple, easily prepared fare, through to technical and specialised meals that are challenging, yet rewarding when plated.If cooking Italian is your passion, this book is a necessary addition to your library."
2,il Libro Cosi Cosi,"The book is an interesting compilation of recipes however they say it is translated for American Kitchens. First of all most Americans don't make recipes according to weight so unless you have a kitchen scale you will have to estimate everything for example a pound of flower or a jigger of something. Also some recipes are things that Americans don't make like Brains.I've made a few recipes and I think that they aren't anything special they are just like Italian American food I've had but they tend to be bland. I also don't think this represents all the regions because you don't see a transformation of ingredients they are all uniform throughout and as you know just from traveling throughout the US alone cooking is very different, the same applies to Italian food.It is a good cookbook for individuals who are just learning how to cook as far as learning what basic ingredients going into things but they also need to recognize that most American cookbooks are not the same."
3,Interesting but one serious flaw . . .,"I bought this book with high expectations. . . I wanted to consult a cookbook that was written for Italians and was considered authentic. This book was translated several decades ago and ""adapted for american kitchens"" which means that a lot of the recipes are translated using substitute ingredients that are not authentic. There are a lot more italian cooking ingredients available in grocery stores today than when this book was translated but the revision does not take account of it."
2,Saveur Cooks Recipes Journal Missed Very Good By A Recipe!,"Saveur could have added two to three more recipes per category in the original book. I would have like to see additional ""drop-ins"" packages for each catergory that I could review online, select, and purchase as time goes on."
3,Arling & Cameron - All-In,"Arling & Cameron's debut album, _All-In_, managed to smoosh together Europop, techno, J-pop lounge and go-go, in one convenient package. So even if the chirpy ""We Love Dancing"" doesn't hit the right chord (too reminiscent of toontown techno for my tastes -- but the slowed-down version on ""We Love Dub"" seems okay), the jazz rolls of ""Here We Go"" work better. And while you may think ""Voulez-Vous?"" would be an ABBA cover, it turns out to be a slinky piece of sleazy listening. Similarly, ""Speeding Down the Highway"" is made for Barcalounger-outfitted Jaguar convertibles driven by cool cats. There's also the campy and happily cheesy ""Ein Abend in Wein,"" replete with whistling chorus. Arling & Cameron seem content to keep the rhythms primarily to peppy breaks, which is good for jumping-up but which gets tiring after a while. The theremin on ""Gershwin,"" however, is a nice, surprising touch. As a first shot across the bow of pop music, it's good fun."
4,If These Pots Could Talk,"This is the largest, heaviest book I own. Really! I thought it would take years to get through, but the pages are quite thick, and it's well-written. A fun book for the pottery enthusiast who is already familiar with the basics, it gives numerous insights into the detective work employed in the course of archeological research. Refreshingly personal on the part of the author. Each chapter is an appitizer that stimulates the reader's interest in another facet of (unfortunately) rarely encountered pottery. The charming cover adds to the book's appeal as a coffee-table selection, but make sure the table has sturdy legs!"
4,Loved it,"I really enjoyed reading this book. The passion was so extraordinarily sweet,and reverting. Incorporating nature in the story line was awesome ."
3,ok read,i enjoyed this book only because the dialogue between the h/h was sexy and some of the best ive read but the rest of the story was totally unrealistic totally give money to sb who had a hand in killing your father ????the sister being so evil unspeakably evil throughout the book and in the end does nothing makes no sense?! also i dont understand why since the guys brother was such a great guy why that whenever he was alone with the girl we were always left to believe he was about to kiss her also the bird and quote lady got on my nerves it had the bases for a great book if it didnt have the unrealistic senarios as if someone doesnt know when he has seen a ghost!but the words spoken by the guy especially in the beginning are some the sexiest ive read so for that reason i liked the fact i read it!
3,Good overview - No Details,"Sure, Tomie De Paola is a famous author. But that doesn't mean that every book is a hit. This book is a decent overview--there are no details...i.e. (The Haggadah) ""tells us the story of Passover."" Nu? So where is the story? OH... second to last page, where there is one sentence ""We celebrate Passover to remember when Moses led the Hebrew people out of slavery in Egypt."" But there is no picture that shows this exciting event!If you are only going to buy one Passover board book, make it ""My First Passover Board Book"" by DK Publishing.... excellent pictures, details on all aspects, and real life pictures. You can adapt it to younger kids by skipping stuff... and it still makes sense."
4,A wonderful insite into the world of electronic music,"In this easy to read reference, Brent Hurtig takes you through the basic concepts and parts of the basic monophonic analogue synths of the 60's and 70's. This book is a wonderful introductory guide into the world of eletronic music and its origins. Just after reading the first few chapters out of a copy I got from the local library, I can now tell what makes an analogue synth tick. It also gives you a look at MIDI basic principles and the invention of digital synthesis.This book has sparked my imagination about electronic music and made me want to get out there and make some noise. My only negative comment is that it's a little out of date, but if your looking for information on modular synthesis, Moogs or analogue basics, this is the place."
3,Quick Read,"Breezed through this book literally within hours. Found some frustrating areas as the author did a lot of telling through character dialogue rather than showing. Some of the story line was way too predictable and felt alittle rushed. Instead of having situations unfold, the author simply had the charcter tell about about it through dialogue. There was too much character back story and not enough growth of the characters through out the book. That being said, it wasn't terrible, just not a 5 star worthy novel."
5,PERFECT GIFT FOR YOUR GODPARENTS,"What a wonderful book -- a rich, fascinating history of the role of godparents, but written with a light, even funny touch. I got this for my daughter's godparents, and for my godchildren, and for my sister to give to her kids' godparents, and so on and so on. Thank you, author Michelle DeLiso, for pulling all this history and all these facts and so much wit together into such a great package."
2,Just for beginners,"This racquet is only for your guests that don't know anything about true table tennis. It is a good, inexpensive introduction to a pips-in paddle but anyone who is looking to really learn table tennis should look at Butterfly or Killerspin paddles."
2,not too impressed,I though this shark would be bigger. I bought the same one at a gift shop in RI for 99 cents 2 years ago.
2,Very Basic,"Very disappointed. Title is very misleading. Tactics are not covered. Whole chapter on knives is really unnecessary. Only 66 pages out of 288 are even devoted to cowboy shooting. Many Cowboy clubs listed at rear of book that may be useful. The bulk of this book is devoted to Firearms Values, and many of the guns listed are not even used in Cowboy Action. The values pages were simply copied from 'The Standard Catalog of Firearms, 15th Edition'. If you want that information, buy that book. All in all, a very disapointing book and not worth the money. Questionable if this book would even be of any use to someone wanting to get into Cowboy Action Shooting."
4,Terk Antenna,The item was recieved quickly and after a simple install is working quite well. The price was less expensive then I saw elsewhere and am very happy with its cost and performance.
2,bouquets,"the book is ok, but the condition of this book was awful book is warped and there is a full page written message to someone on the inside.I purchased it to show to brides for ideas,but I would be embarrased to show this one"
3,Mantra/Fiori,"J'aime bien ce CD. Cependant, il faut se familiariser avec les Mantras.La musique que Serge Fiori a ajoutée est intéressante. Ce CD possède laversion anglaise pour ce qui est des explications du Mantra. Il existeune version franaise; à vous de bien vérifier. Si vous cherchez d'autresversions vérifiez auprès du Centre Birla au Québec, ils sauront vous aider."
2,More thought into the design... would have been nice,"I have a Bayou Classic Single Burner (SQ 14... which is awsome by the way). So, I thought having some shelves on each side of the burner would be really nice. And when I got then I was impressed at the construction. The material was the same as the metal framing of the ""burner"" I have from Bayou Classic.... The only draw back is the way the shelves attach to my burner..... They just hang on, by upside-down U shaped hooks, which is nice for taking them on and off, but stability and having a level surface... not gonna happen......... with a few modifications (maybe an actual screw on design, and more shelve support) it could have been a really good thing to have."
1,I know the truth about BRETT FARVE FANATIC!,This BrettFavrefanatic is none other than the sick son of a bitch author Michael Lane. He has ruined his credibility because he has been charged with 18 accounts of child molestation and tells about his accounts of raping the kids in his book. Do not read this book FOR YOUR OWN SAFETY!!
5,A great escape,I love this cartoon and I loved the book. It helped me catch up on some columns I missed. I really love this family. Her comments add dimension.
4,About what a scout manual would have.,"Very Basic. Not bad, but not great. Considering this book is for my children the very basic information contained in it is appropriate for someone just starting out in Wilderness Fieldcraft, Survival, or Bushcraft as the Euro's seem to like to call it. Both of Ray's books that I ordered for my boys have sparked their interest. So I gave it four stars for this reason. The writing style is clean and to the point. Easy for young teens to understand."
3,Musings of a fighter pilot,"I think if I were a fellow pilot I could better have appreciated Salter's memoir/musings. Some of this book was quite good but don't expect to learn a lot about the air war over Korea from this title. The author makes little effort to put his experiences in context or to explain any of his thoughts and emotions. That having been said, this short book is worthwhile reading as an account from someone who was there and especially for the insights into the thoughts of a fighter pilot in action."
5,Convincing Indictment,"Bruce Tap's, book may force the reader to rethink the benefits of the North's partisan political system. Historian Mark Neely has also questioned how partisanship benefited the war's prosecution.The CCW was a highly partisan commission that investigated northern military failures and scandals. Tap exposes how the committee's leaders Ben Wade and Zachariah Chandler tried to purge the Union army of all conservative elements, believing that only antislavery Republicans could win the War. While the committee did help expose racial atrocities and minor corruption, the total lack of military knowledge on the CCW more often than not impeded the war's prosecution. Pressure for a general advance may have contributed to the disaster at Fredericksburg. It is telling that the committee's favorite generals seemed to have been Ben Butler, John C. Fremont, Joe Hooker, Ambrose Burnside, and John Pope. A Must read for all Civil War nuts."
4,Should be on the bookshelf,"I enjoyed this even handed depiction of the Lincoln era and its behind the scene workings of the Committee on the Conduct of the War.The Radical Republicans and the control they wielded actually impacted military decision making in some instances.Tap brings to light the attitudes, so much different than today, of politicians and their views of the still ""young"" institution of West Point.Tap reveals the treatment West Point Democratic Generals received in the Radically Repubican run Federal government.A good addition to your bookshelf."
1,cartoon mockery of SG-1,"i havent bought this title yet but have seen the episodes off the TV. I have to say unless your a die-hard stargate fan, akid with a real imagination or realy bored then dont buy this! Since im a fan of stargate then i will be buying this ;), basically its a cartoon mockery of Sg1 and the producers of sg1 has said this is not worthy of our stargate franchise. FOREVER STARGATE! and ATLANTIS SOON !1/5"
3,shocking,"I was pleased and disturbed at the same time by Helen Zahavi's ""Dirty Weekend"".Thrilled that yes finally a woman takes control of the abuse she suffers at the hands of men. She lets us know how we take for granted the fact that we can't go outdoors at night alone, how we are unspoken prisoner's of our homes and then not even safe there.Disturbed by the graphic violence, yes. I would like to see more books where women take charge but not in such a violent way.I think there is a Bella in all of us and hopefully we don't get battered enough that she has to come out."
1,Why?????,This book had no purpose and I personally hated it. Did anyone who has read this book enjoy it or get what the message was suppose to be. It certainly not pleasure reading.
5,Bella's Revenge,The female protagonist in this book totally makes up for all of the books and movies where the women are portrayed as wimpy little ankle sprainers who need strong men for protection. Over sexed men who treat women as sex objects would be well advised to steer clear of our Bella.For lovers of black humor only. That includes me. Great book.
1,An obnoxious writing style gets in the way of the story,"This book was alternately published as The Weekend: A Novel of Revenge in its first printing.I like dark comedies, and I thought I'd give this one a try, because I was hooked by the first page. But the narrative declines quickly. Some readers complain about the novel's graphic and violent imagery. I don't mind extreme violence that is obviously intended as a joke. And I generally enjoy the strut and swagger of noir prose, but the style in this book is over the top. Almost every action and thought is reexamined and retold before moving on to the next one. An example: ""She laughed, and her laughter was a terrible sin. It was sinful laughter."" The entire book is written this way. You can literally skip two in three sentences (and this is the only way to get through the text) and still get the complete story. I could never get into the story because of the irritating style.American Psycho is a far superior dark comedy of manners. Read that instead."
3,Good book but dated style,I used the book for my graduate level class in Numerical Methods. The book explains numerical concepts well but there are very few worked out examples. The algorithms are presented as pseudocode which is a very very archaic style of presenting. The authors should realize that the best way to explain is to actually work out some examples. Thats why I give this book three stars.
4,Taboo cool,This was purchased as a gift and was received very happily. The segments are so interesting and really great to watch with a group. Everyone's responses are different and its a great convo starter.
5,Equanimity...,"This is a superior holistic workout that leaves you feeling very calm.As usual Ana and Ravi's attention to detail is perfect, music is brilliant, and Ana together with Ravi's instruction enables you to execute each move and, (importantly) understand why the position is good for you!The most notable outcome after completing an Ana and Ravi workout is no food cravings! Staying emotionally balanced all day and maintaining energy levels are an added bonus.Again, I would recommend without hesitation."
3,Not for me,"I would like to say that I LOVE Ana Brett and Ravi Singh... and I am in no way saying that this is a ""bad"" DVD, it just wasn't for me. I teach Hatha and vinyasa yoga and I love to practice Kundalini yoga to add some variety in my practice, I like each style of yoga separately but I didn't think the mix worked well here.This is what I didn't like about the DVD, and again this is just my opinon:1. In the intro they claim this is a mix between Hatha/power/kundalini yoga, but there wasn't any power yoga in it2. The back ground music during the ""tune in""... distracting3. The segments individually are good, but they don't flow nicely one after the other4. The ""sun salutaion"" segment lacked sun salutations5. I liked the meditation at the end however the chanting\background music was distracting. I like them each individual but not togetherThis is what I did like:1. Tom Carden's music2. Ravi Singh's soothing voice3. The hamstring section"
2,Not the best Ana & Ravi have done,"I am a huge fan of Ana and Ravi's. I find when I switch my workouts to more weight or even cardio intensive with less kundalini yoga, I miss their workouts and have to change my routine around again to fit in more! Maybe this routine is better for beginners who really do need a slower pace. After any of the other Ravi/Ana workouts, I feel like I've had a really challenging workout. This is the only one where I just don't feel that way. I don't feel particularly stretched, strengthened or challenged.I like Ana's singing, but I do find it distracting during the meditations-- especially when I'm supposed to be focusing on my pulse.If you're looking for a more energetic practice, I wouldn't recommend this one. I am a big fan of their original For Beginners and Beyond, Bliss Hips, & Fat Free Yoga."
4,"Chet, all his songs in his best voice.","Chet Baker was, in the 50's, first known as a ""Cool"" or ""West Coast"" jazz trumpeter with the appearance of a movie star.Then he sang ""My Funny Valentine"" and it became a huge hit. He alternated between playing and singing. This set contains the a collection of his best singing (and some trumpet).His voice can be an acquire taste. People either love it or hate it. His voice is a thin, high tenor. Those who like it feel he is terribly romantic, sensative, sad, fragile, and melancholy. Full of emotion.Those who don't say he sounds effete and epicene.Both agree he does not sound macho. The ""After Midnight"" title seems to have been invented for these torch songs.This is the best he ever sang, before the drugs ruined his voice and his ablity to sing on-key. These CDs can be bought together in this set or separately."
4,Daughter enjoys it,"My daughter picked this out when spending grandma's birthday gift last year and has enjoyed tremendously. It is one of her favorite items and she is getting to the age where dolls are not a high priority toy, so I would recommend this product to anyone who has children who enjoys dolls."
4,Starfish drawer knobs,"Great decorative knob for a dresser at our beach home. Beware however that these knobs are very dark, almost black. I was expecting something more pewter colored so I gave each a quick spray with silver spray before installing."
4,"com""YULE""ation Cleric : Green & Gold... fal,la,la","Tradition. That`s what makes the Green Bay Packers special. The fans and the team go hand in hand as the only major publicly-owned franchise and a non-profit corporation. With the team`s rich history it has become a unquie part of the American culture. After the Glory years, we all knew that someday the Pack would be back.Wisconsin Winter Sundays for me always meant coming home from church to watch the Packers and if the weather turned nasty so much the better. ""Christmas Carols For Green Bay Fans"" honors this team`s past, gives cheer for the present, and helps lighten the look into the future.~~Merrily Mix~ 4th and 6 at the 12~along with just a`bout all others~~ Post Script: O Come All Ye Faithful, O Come As They Score Touchdowns ***Farve`n***"
1,Same old same ol,This political propoganda speaks nothing to the limited lives of the suburban youth that listen to this band. The lyrics are the same text book rage and the music is the same sound as the last album. Tom's guitar work is the only redeeming quality this album has.
4,great sounding adaptation of Christmas and other songs,"This CD has great arrangements, talented performers and is very easy to listen to. There are some cool modern adaptations of classic Christmas songs as well as other great compositions covering various styles such as swing/rockabilly, alternative, rock, pop and dance. 2 thumbs up."
3,Not a bad energy supplement,"They seemed to work for about a month, then I couldn't really feel a difference. They are really cheap for a pack of 3. Worth giving a try if you plan to use them short term. Long term, I think they stop working."
3,"interesting, but too little variety","I liked that this book was easy to read and largely free of jargon and academic talk. There was a lot of topics covered from urban paranoia to consumer behavior, but most of these topics dealt with New York as their sole example. True there were chapters on Disney and Berkshires, but I would have liked to see more variety of locales as most cities have different ""shared cultures"" than New York and it would be nice to see some of these differences reflected in her book."
3,Yoga Video,The DVD skips a ton and sometimes freezes. Very frustrating when trying to have a yoga session. I like the moves in this DVD but the narration is a bit weird.
3,not as good as the others,"I have like 10 of ana and Ravi's dvds. MY most fav are the fat free and the ultimate stretch. I really liked the push ups in this and the abdominal exercise, wow I felt that for 2 days but I didnt like the cardio moves in this dvd but I love Ana and Ravi's kundalini Yoga. Please keep on bringing new moves and exercises. Thanks"
3,"Got The Chops, Get Out of the Rut","Two outstanding songs grace this talented artists cd. J.B. and the Drifters have some spunk, they're not self-involved whiners with questionable vocal talents, which seperates them from other wacked out dullards in their musical category. Then to fill out the cd, there's the same song, five different ways with different lyrics. But I'll take those two great songs and be happy with it. You find them for yourself.Willard Hock"
3,so plush damn,"THIS IS A GREAT TRACK! BUT IF YOU ALREADY OWN EITHER THE SO PLUSH SELF TITLED CD OR THE BLUE STREAK SOUNDTRACK ITS NOT WORTH PICKING UP, AS ALL THE MIXES ARE THE SAME APART FROM THE NO RAP VERSION. IF ANYONE KNOWS OF A REMIX OF ,DAMN; PLEASE LET ME KNOW!"
2,Too Small,"The ring itself is attractive and looks to be well made, but it is very small - much smaller than the picture makes it look. It looks like it is for a child. I have returned it."
1,Never arrived,"I bought this as part of a planned birthday gift, however, it never arrived. It's very disappointing to open your amazon package in the mail and there be an item missing that I already paid for. Packing slip lied."
3,Weird and confusing rules,"Good luck trying to figure out how this game works. The rules are not clear on a few things including transposition of pieces from board to board. It's almost like the variant Alice Chess but it isn't. When a king is in check, I just don't get how he gets out of check or to which board? Good luck, that's all I can say."
5,Strato chess,"This game is awesome. Read the rules carefully, it takes a little getting use to but it is a lot of fun. Pieces are small and not a lot of weight to them, kinda wish there was a wee bit more space betwixt the planes. I had to use a couple pieces of hardware of my own fore a couple screws were no tapped properly. Once assembled though it is quite sturdy. I got one for my brother as well and we e-mail moves to each other, we constantly have a time going and can stay at our own homes.All in all I am happy with this purchase and product. Amazons service was great too. Product showed up on time and undamaged."
1,Really disappointed,"I have loved allot of Carolyn Myss's work in the past, but this one is just a real disappointment. She brings up allot of very good points in the program, but falls short in addressing them. She either does not completely address a paticular point or she just goes on a rant that totally takes away from the point she was originally trying to make. There is so much overly opinionated commentary on her part that you begin to tune out her voice. I hope this is not what we can continue to expect from her future work."
2,incomplete packaging,"When I opened the box there was a notice saying that if there was any missing pieces please notify the company and they would replace the pieces immediately. I looked and there were missing pieces so I emailed the company. They got back to me in a timley manner but said that I gave them incomplete information. I gave them every number, company name that was written on or in the box, but still they said they needed more. To make a long story short they will not give you the missing pieces you'll have to buy them yourself. They disguise themselves as helpful, but they aren't. I was very unhappy. I do not reccomend this product."
3,Not as bad as you would think.,"I mainly ordered this because I wanted my girlfriend to here ""Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds"". I was actually surprised to find some of the spoken word tracks to be interesting and Nimoy can actually hold a tune. I am not saying these tracks are under-rated. There is nothing here worthy of a Grammy, and the back up band on most of the Shatner tracks sounds like the same bunch that did the music for the original Star Trek show, but you may find yourself listening to it several times. The two stars of the show are definitely Shatner's renditions of ""Lucy"" and ""Mr. Tambourine Man."" Both of which are un-believably awful. The sample tracks provide a pretty good idea of what you are getting. Enjoy but don't expect to laugh yourself into tears of every track."
3,Space Girls are Easy!,"I bought the CD as a joke gift. I'm sure it's some of Kirk's and Spock's best work. I just wish they were backed by the wall of sound studios of Phil Spector. I didn't even listen to it, but I'd recommend the Spock solos - live long & prosper!"
5,After reading these reviews...,"I've already been laughing for the past 45 minutes, and Ijust ordered the album - it hasn't arrived yet. I think Amazonis missing a marketing opportunity by not charging people toread these reviews, because they're hysterical!"
5,Looks like the item for the job,Received the item well packaged and on time (actually 1 day early) seeing that it had to travel to Ireland.The cooler came with all the parts necessary to fit it to my vehicle. I have not fitted it yet as I am in the middle of a restoration project so I cannot comment on how well it functions. I have no doubt that it will perform as expected.Installation looks easy enough for the average DIY mechanic with a basic toolkit.
4,Great high-fiber flour addition,"I've used it to compensate for using agave nectar instead of sugar. It really sucks up the liquid in a recipe, so even if you substitute just 1/2 cup of ap flour for the coconut flour, it does some great things for the recipe. It lends such a nice richness, without extra fat, to cookies and cakes. And, it makes the house smell terrific when I'm baking."
1,Taste like eating sand only grittier!,To say this stuff was awful tasting would be kind. If you are looking for a carb substitute go with TVP instead.Should have a negative star rating.
5,"Wow! Clear, comprehensive and unbiased info","Sitting in your doctor's waiting room is usually not the most productive way to spend one's time. However, I had a good 45 minutes in my homeopath's office to peruse ""The Complete Family Guide to Alternative Medicine,"" and found it to contain a wealth of answers to questions I had asked myself on numerous occasions. For example, I've felt that I could use some bodywork training -- this book's descriptions of Alexander, Feldenkrais, and all the others helped me see quickly that Alexander will best suit my needs. Homeopathic, aromatherapy, flower essences, all forms of meditation and psychotherapy, chiropractic -- virtually everything is there, with attractive photographs, beautiful layouts, and handy sidebars that clearly list the ailments for which any given alternative therapy could be expected to provide benefits. I was so impressed, I copied down the name of the book and came straight home to go online and see if Amazon had it. Highly recommended"
3,Not quite what I was looking for.,"This book contains a wealth of information and can be quite useful, but it did not however contain the specific information that I was looking for at the time of purchase. Still it does have its uses."
3,Not sure,"I would love to review the book, but that's hard to do when the supplier mails you the wrong book. Instead of Once and Future City I got some random novel that I've never seen before in my life let alone ordered."
1,Don't waste your money,"My four month old cries in the car, so I hunted this toy down, hoping it might entertain him. He loves it...but sadly, the clips are not large enough to attach to the car seat. I ended up attaching the clips to the retractable hood on the car seat, which somewhat works, but even then the arch is so short that the toys hang right in front of his chest.At that close range, my son can easily pull on the toys hard enough to completely pull the arch off.This is a great concept, but the arch needs to be extendable, the clips more adaptable and sturdier (maybe with rubber lining), and it might even be better for the toys to be on springy cloth attachments to make them more ""pull"" friendly.I wish I hadn't so hastily cut off the tags..."
4,"Fun, stroller toy","I did not use this with my son's infant seat. I used the Fisher Price bugs (great product!) I bought this item for his stroller. So far, so good. He enjoys playing with it when we are out and about. The toys kept him entertained for a while, I guess a few months. I recently bought the Tiny love trio to switch out the other toys with and now he is playing with it again. Now that he is older he does pull it off the stroller, but he is still enjoying it and I haven't lost any toys. Overall, fun stroller toy."
2,Cute but not for a Britax carseat,"I bought this because on the package it said that you could use it on all car seats, strollers and infant carriers. However, I have a Britax Marathon with very thick padding and curved sides and couldn't find a way to make it work. Too bad because it's very cute and the colors are beautiful."
2,Doesn't clip to the car seat,"The toys on this arch are very cute. My son loves them. However, it does not clip on very well to the car seat (Graco Snug Ride). Sometimes I can get it to stay on for a few minutes, but then it pops off. If the fit was better it would be excellent, but as is it is useless as a car toy. We take the dangling toys off and use them with the Gymini or to play with separately, but you could find other toys that are cheaper to suit this purpose. I would not recommend buying this if you want something to clip to the car seat."
2,Does not stay attached to car seat,"My 3 month old loves playing with this toy when he is in his car seat, but he can now grab the toys and pull them. When he does this the arch comes off the car seat and it has already it him twice on the head. I wish that this product was designed better because my son really does love it."
5,a lifesaver - don't think twice!,"This activity arch has been fantastic. Our baby has loved looking at it since he was only a couple of months old. Now, at 9 months, we clip it to his carseat all of the time. It keeps him well occupied (batting at the toys, watching them, etc.)We know that if we take him out to run errands and he's asleep that he'll be happy when he wakes up and his arch is clipped to his seat waiting for him.This would be a GREAT (and very USEFUL) gift too!"
4,Great Workout!!,"This is a challenging yet rewarding work out. With classics like jumping jacks,scissors,and knee bends done ala Kundalini. Wonderful meditations at the end and as with all the Ravi/Ana Dvd's great music."
5,Great Workout,"I own and love several of Ana & Ravi's videos, and I wasn't disappointed at all with this new one. I especially enjoyed the new mantras and the variety of excercises.(My one complaint would be than Ana's new blond hair and various style changes during the video can be a little distracting.)"
2,disappointed,"I looked forward to the release of Ana and Ravi's new titles very much, but have to say I am disappointed.The workout is still a good one, but like what another reviewer had said, the background was very distracting and so was the inconsistent and roving camera. I also found the music too loud and the pace too fast."
3,there may be better places to look than mogwai,"although this is an interesting ep with some beautifully put together moments, on the whole, i think there are much better cds for everything that they do. tortoise seems to create a better sound on the whole than does mogwai and arab strap is better than mogwai at allowing you to live in misery for a bit. neither of these bands do incredibly similar things to mogwai's quiet, introspective sound, so if you want a cd that is almost as good as tortoise and almost as depressing as arab strap, then this could be a good buy. all in all, however, i don't want to be too critical because this album definitely has a relatively innovative sound, specializing more in dealing with creating an emotional atmosphere rather than coming out and bluntly dealing with their motivating factors for making music."
2,I stopped using it,"I got this thinking that it would work with any charge cable. It does not, it only works with the cheap cable that you get with it. The cable plugs into the black part shown in the picture.I was very disappointed with the cable and also disappointed that it did not work with normal 360 play n' charge cables. When the cable broke (which only took a few weeks) I couldn't use the battery anymore and had no way to charge it. I would not buy this again."
4,Good for the price,"This is an alternative to the play and charge kit. I had an official play and charge kit a few years ago and it broke rather fast. I have been using batteries ever since. This item here has changed that. Although it does not hold a very long charge, it works if you plug it in while playing. It will work up to a few hours if it is charged up, but it does not hold a charge very well. If you're looking to stop wasting batteries and do not mind playing while it is plugged in, this is the item for you. And let me note that the length of the cord to the battery is not very long; it's probably a little more than four feet. So it is not idle for anyone who will be sitting far away from their console.It does not have the same problem as the play and charge kit. The wire plugs directly into the battery pack, not the top of the controller, so I doubt it will break."
3,cheaper doesn't mean better,"The product charges the battery but sometimes it doesn't charge it fully. The green indicator light comes on even though the battery is 3 bars out of 4 charged. The biggest most annoying thing is that while you play, the charge and play cord easily comes off the controller. I have the genuine Microsoft charge kit, and it's very difficult to disconnect the cord. In this case in the middle of the game you have to watch your cord or it will come off. Besides that, I guess next time I will buy genuine accessories."
2,Silence singles = fail,"Firstly the tracklist for this single does not match up with the cover art picture shown for the listing, the same goes for the part 1 single listed on amazon.So if your buying this cd based on this cover you are getting the 2 track single.In regards to the tracks listed for this item (silence, tanglin and butterfly) if you do not like country music you will not like tanglin. Butterfly is very similar to blind on the other silence single, slow, dull and not worth a listen.Overall both of these singles stink, only worth getting for the completist. Also these songs are found on Five Men in a Hut."
2,More of the same old stuff.,"This was not what i thought I was getting, it is more of the same old films and does not come up with anything new. I watched once and put it away and will sell at the next yard sale. Not much here to recommend and I would not purchase it again."
5,"IF I COULD RATE THIS MORE THAN 5 STAR, I WOULD!!!!!!","Hai! This CDs da BomB!!!!!!!!! I love playing this when I'm driving 160 KMH on the freeway in TOKYO!!!!!!! FUEL gives you that feeling. Metallica fans, get this! It may cost a bit more because it's an Import Japanese Single but, it's definitely worth it!!!!!!"
4,The Devil Inside,"Charlie Rush's The Devil's Chessboard, except for all the hacking and slashing, was a great little Civil War ""cozy"" mystery. Don't get me wrong--the hacking and slashing are central to the story, and needed, and it is set during the Civil War, where war is hell, and murder set within your own ranks, worse. Charlie has a great sense of history, and did his research. You feel as though you're back in 1862, living out the mystery along with the characters in his tale. I like how he also included snippets of data at the beginning of his chapters. Nice touch. As his dedication tells you, one of his three great-grandfathers, Private John W. Allen, served under Hood's Texas brigade, and you can sense Charlie's pride for the Confederate forces, and Texas in particular. Texas, it seems is a state of mind, not just a state."
1,Would not stay on the track.,We returned this train because it would not stay on the track at any corner.We had the jet engine prior to this until it was broken by improper use. We will probably get that one again. It always drove pretty well around the tracks.
2,Poorly made,"I bought 2 of these. The first one stopped working after about 30 minutes (seller replaced, which was nice). But, now the 2nd one broke (purple one) after only a few months. Given that these are not inexpensive and a 'name brand', I expected them to last. Alas, as with most things these days, these do not appear to be well made. I have not contacted the seller regarding the 2nd one, and I plan to seek out a more durable brand. Sorry, Thomas!"
4,My sons love it.,"My sons love to play with it.So, they don't need to push the trains around.It is powerful enough to tow along 10+ trains.The motor can easily be broken, if your kids like to push them.We have two broken already, and we bought the replacement because my sons love them so much.We also have the Thomas version.The Thomas has 2 more wheels, and they make the train more easily to get stuck or run out of track.So, the Percy runs better."
3,No what we expected!,"We purchased this thinking it would be like the Thomas that we received as a hand me down. The Thomas is at least 5 years old and I'm not sure if it's just made differently, but this one does not have the automatic stop when it is stuck. It continues to run despite the fact that it's stuck and the push button on top is a lot more stiff. Perhaps with toys being more cheaply made these days, quality is not what it used to be."
4,Nice Series,"These trains are extremely sturdy and well designed (they'll take a lickin' and keep on tickin'), but they're not very fast if that's what you're looking for. I think the speed they're designed for is more a function of track design (If they were much faster, they'd probably come off the curved tracks more frequently). The one thing I'd probably suggest to the designers apart from a little more speed is a sound element. The age of the children this is made for, well they want to interact and play with the trains, and they would love to hear the trains go ""Choo-choo"" or say ""Hi, I'm Percy, here I goooooo..."" or some such simple thing. I'd like to think that such a design element is not technologically beyond these companies that make so much money off of us parents because these shows and characters are so well marketed."
2,Wish I had skipped this one.,"Went off track easily and stopped working within a week. The wheels lock when the train is not powered and thus was a bit disappointment to my nephew. The on off switch was too hard for him to depress, and then it stopped working all together."
2,"Not bad, but needs to be refined.","Not bad, not good. Needs better blade and an improved length setting system. It was a little difficult to get into the lower areas with its shape."
4,GOOD FOR SCHOOL USE,"The concept of the Underground Railroad is difficult for most children to grasp, and they first think it is similar to the subway. I used this book with elementary students in a small rural school in North Carolina where there are very few minority students; they loved it. For the first time they were able to understand the horrors of slavery and what the slaves and ""conductors"" alike risked for freedom in the North. The author does an excellent job of making this dark and complex chapter in our history understandable the students. The wanted to read it again and again."
4,Useful for new and other turners,I'm a new turner and found the explanations and guides useful in becoming familiar with tools and use in becoming at east at the lather
5,Great book,"I bought this book because of the recommendation of other woodworkers. I needed a book that would give me a good basic foundation in wood turning since I knew absolutely nothing about a lathe or turning.This book delivered exactly what I was looking for in an uncomplicated manner, from explaining the different tools to actual turning projects.This is a great book and I highly recommend it to anyone wanting to learn about wood turning/lathe/turning tools."
1,pulp,"as bad ass as this sounds this is the biggest tease,....dont spend money on buying this item cause i dosent even work...or find out the hard way..............sincerly isaac coustemer since 2002pulp fan since 1998............."
4,Angels on the Roof a great book!,"Angels on the Roof, by Martha Moore is about a girl named Shelby and her mother who is a little bit crazy. She has moved around many times in her life and is very sick of it. She goes to Red Valley with her mother to find out about her father. By the end of the book she figures out who her father is and she is very upset about it. In the end Shelby realizes that she doesn't need a father and that her mother is enough. I recomend this book to young teens because it is very interesting and is teaches you a lot about life. I realized by this book that family is very important and you shouldn't take them for granted. The reason I liked this novel so much is because it keeps you interested throught the whole book it never gets boring. I think that anyone who likes to read mysteries would love this book!"
2,Very disappointing,"This was such a disappointment. First, the age discrepancy between the earl and Josie in the series - she gets older but he doesn't? Josie was a major disappointment. Where was the sharp wit and intelligence? At the end she tries to drug Mayne and have him dragged to a boat. Really? Ms. James also tries too hard with Josie's physical attributes. Okay, she is not a slim heroine but the way she carries on makes me think that Josie is more like a sausage than voluptuous. I really liked Mayne in the earlier books and hoped for a better development when his own story came around. This is definitely not a keeper."
4,Love this CD,We use this CD to relax at night before going to bed. The chants are mono-tones and are very soothing.
3,"Nice, but small",I really loved the way it looked when it arrived. The design was beautiful and the quality of the pearl and the diamond were as advertised. But be sure you take a ruler out and actually look at how small this is before you order it. It was kinda a surprise when I opened the box.
4,The Voice,"With such songs as Going Back. Dont Stop. Elkie Brooks shows her ability to sing any type of song, with power!!"
3,good for the money,"It is well made, has sufficient compartments. the one problem I have is that the bottom of the bag has very little support, just a flimsy removable plastic piece."
2,Come on MAN!!,"First, I want to start off by saying that I a huge fan of the series. Why the reason for the low score? Dont know if I got a bad copy of a DVD, but the picture suck!! I saw small lines going up and down the screen through out the entire movie!! That really piss me off cause I am seen the Jap. version and I don't remember all these lines in it. Secondly, they change the english voice actors. I am still trying to get use to them, but I feel that it not the same. The 86 driver voice, he doesn't put the same emotion or firer, like the old voice. I don't feel the connect to well. I also got the 4th Stage Eng. The picture it much cleaner and no lines, so I would rate that 4 out of 5.If you can get pass through two things, then it is really a good movie. Thats my honest feelings. I wish funumation would have done a better job in releasing this last piece of the series."
2,4 Stars when it works - Mine only last 15 months,"I had a Samsung LTM225W for 15 months and then it just went bad. (I replaced the power convertor to no avail). I'm now dealing with Samsung's extremely poor 12 month warranty offering. I've had TV last 20 years on me and now the most expensive TV I've ever bought didn't last 2 years! I'm very frustrated. If you buy Samsung products, consider getting an extended warranty plan since Samsung doesn't stand very firmly behind their products."
1,Replacement Belt,"Terrible product. Both belts in the package lasted less than a minute.Eureka 61120b Extended Life Replacement Belt Style ""U"""
2,Still breaks frequently,"I bought three belts to replace the broken one in my Eureka vacuum. The first one lasted two hours, and the second one two weeks. I'm on the third of three now -- if it breaks, I might just replace the vacuum with one that's of higher quality. That said, the belts haven't impressed me."
1,Danze Faucet,"1 star.... I renovated my bathroom in April 2009-down to the stud. I used the Danze faucet ($$$$) and unfortunately the handle is already peeling Sept '10. I must say, my previous bathroom faucet was 15+ years old and held up better than this product. Very disappointed. I will post further details once I get in contact with CS."
4,Any questions? The answers are here!,"This CD of mostly originals by Deanna Witkowski is quite spectacular in most respects. The overall sound of the album is excellent, and the ensembles are tight, with ambitious arrangements and complicated time/feel changes that are navigated smoothly. Most of the cuts are sophisticated and satisfying. The opposite of background music, or ""smooth jazz"", this is an intelligent CD that needs your attention to be fully appreciated!Deanna's light, airy vocals are a perfect fit for the hip, changing grooves on the first track, which also features passionate solos in a tune slightly reminiscent of Urszula Dudziak's work. Deanna's piano work is astounding overall - she plays with mastery, whimsy, humor and finesse - sounding a bit like Bill Evans on BLAME IT ON MY YOUTH, and swinging solidly on I'M ALL SMILES. The latter song reveals her vocal limitations, however - the only reason for 4 stars, and not 5!"
2,2 pack vs. 2 insoles,"I'm disappointed with this product because of the way it is advertised-BEWARE: although it clearly states 2-Pack, only 1 pack of two insoles come with each order. I think the advertising is deceptive as I, along with other people who ordered this product expected to receive 2 sets of insoles. Amazon should really consider changing what is stated in the ad. Not cool."
4,Thought Provoking and Biased,"Overall a good book but made me question historical accuracies. The book says that scicence oppressed certain scientific discoveries which I thought were oppressed by certain established religions of history. Good book and worth a read, especially if you like science history."
1,Questionable and Off-Target,"I read this as a middle-school student as part of a faith-based curriculum, and I largely feel that it is off-target and questionable in terms of its historical accuracy. Considering that modern society has defined ``truth'' in terms of that which is attainable by the scientific method, the title of the book ``When Science Fails'' is largely a contradiction: The questionable historical accounts given in the book could better be considered examples of ``When Humans Fail'' rather than profound criticisms of the scientific method itself.Read this book if: You do not understand the scientific method; you do not want to understand the scientific method; and you want to read historical allegories of why it is wrong.Do not read this book if: You value your time or money."
1,Fair to Poor,"A friend recommended this book to me. The best thing about the book is that it is short. Frankly, I did not find it all that inspirational, and thought the characters were fairly boring. I don't think that I could recommend to others."
4,The Skier's Edge,"This is a great book for the seasoned skier wanting to understand more on how the body-skis-works together on snow when applying different movements, pressure and so on. Good insights comparing racing techniques to recreational skiing. As a ski instructor I can use this book as a reference guide."
1,If i could give a zero i would,"my 2 year old is absolutely in love with Yo Gabba Gabba! Purchased this dvd for him, and he was sooo excited! Went to put it in the dvd player, and realized it was cracked... Wouldn't even work. Never had the chance to watch it. Such a rip off. I was so disappointed in this purchase."
4,I think it works great.,"If you're looking for a miracle...this isn't it. But, it is a great product. I have used it for about a month, usually twice a day. The one thing I do every time I use it, is really massage it in. I did not use the patches, or the serum.I can't say there is a 100% improvement, but I would say it's about 75%. I am happy with the product, and will purchase again.I think the key here, as with most products, is to have realistic expectations."
3,As long as you're using lotion...,"I'm in week 4, and I still have the dreaded dimples. They are not as bad as they were, but defintely haven't said 'goodbye' yet. But, as long as you are using a lotion, you may as well use this for the minimal effects. Works better than a regular lotion. It smells great, spreads very well, and is quite affordable. My skin is extremely soft where I use it. I recommend this product because I am an especially difficult case; I have more than the little 'area' to tackle, so I didn't expect miracles. Definitely get the PATCHES, they work best for 'relief'. If you have to choose between patches and gel cream, go for the patches if you can afford it. It's a small price to pay for a little self assurance in those shorts and skirts."
1,Does NOT work!,Total waste of money. I have used this product twice a day for a month and I see ZERO difference in the appearance of cellulite. I really wanted it to work but it did NOT work at all! I think the good reviews on this product must be fake. I am better off just using cheap lotion instead. Do not waste your money on this.
1,Work my A................,"after seeing the show on Tyra Banks, ran out and bought one at cvs. used up a whole tube already and still, nada.total waste of $15."
4,Very Detailed Book On Sausage Making,"I am just getting started in sausage making and was looking for a guide for making sausage at home. After reading all the reviews here, I purchased this book. It is a fairly large volume and includes a lot of detail on equipment, meat selection, meat handling, spices, recipes and techniques. There are many recipes for most of the types of sausages that readers would be interested in. The batch sizes are pretty large for the home sausage maker but can be scaled. There is a lot of detail on smoking and smoking equipment. The reason that I gave this book 4 stars instead of 5 is that in my opinion, it is a bit too detailed for the average home sausage maker. Much of the book deals with details that a meat processor may need to know but not needed for the average home sausage maker that is only going to process a couple of pounds of meat at a time. That being said, the recipes are straightforward and should be easy enough for anyone to follow."
2,not for the home sausage maker,"This book would be fine if your goal was to make tons of sausage. The home sausage maker would not generally have the tools, the equipment or be able to find the cuts of meat that are used in the book. If your goal is to make 10-25lbs of sausage at a time and to know all the laws dealing with meat processing then you may find this book helpful"
2,Not worth it,I puchased this book a few weeks ago and it did not live up to what I thought it was going to be.
1,Bulb only lasted a week or two,"The bulb only lasted a week or two. I don't know whether the bulb or the fixture was the cause of the problem, but my best guess is that it was the bulb."
2,Soul Surfer DVD,This book was a great book and inspirational story. The DVD is a little disappointing. It seems to be a low budget DVD and lacks depth. I was hoping for more of her story.
4,Better than the originals?,"Generally I'm not a fan of remakes or remixes, but Me First and the Gimme Gimmes changed my mind. The best track in my opinion is ""I Believe I Can Fly"", however, my best friend swears by ""Mona Lisa"". The secret to this appeal is that MF&tGG have genuine talent. They're worth the money."
5,Great Buy,"I purchased Meet the Sight Words 1,2,&3 DVDs for my 5 year old son. He has caught on really quick and can pick out almost all the sight words from the 1st DVD. Once we complete DVDs 2 & 3 he should be able to read a short story. This was a great investment and I wish I would have learned about it earlier."
2,Not very comfortable,These bunion relievers are stiff and they rub against my skin when worn. I prefer the soft gel type toe separators.
2,Much too stiff,"These are much too stiff for my toes. These hurt my feet when I wear them. I like the soft, clear ones much better."
3,Lousy drawings,"Many of the drawings are very difficult to study. Some are faint, some are drawn with very thick ink lines, and some are so small as to be virtually useless. Don't buy this book unless you can see it in a B&M store and determine if the drawings you are interested in can even be seen"
5,Simple and amusing,Really enjoyed it. quick moving and entertaining . glad i picked this one. short enough to read in one day.
3,could not use it...,"I would have liked this better if I could have one that automaticly had a sensor instead of having to wire it into my car system. I do not know if one is out there, but I did not want the hassel of putting it in."
1,Spare your money - I would give this item zero stars if I could!,All I did with it was boil water - the handle became really hot plus a spot appeared immediately on the bottom of the saucepan. The spot never went away. This product is only good for trash. Don't waste your money on it - it's not even worth returning it...
1,Another Ooopppssss,"I guess I did not read all the fine print regarding the description of this CD. None of these recordings are the originals. They have all been re-recorded and lack any of the rawness The Specials & Fun Boy Three had. If you want a slick, polished, produced and mixed CD, then this is for you. I was really ticked off about my purchase. Reminder to self: Read all the info about the release."
2,Noooo!!!!,How can they actually believe it was a good idea to re-record these songs and then re-release it as a ''greatest hits'' package? This is extremely disappointing. If you're looking for the authentic sound of the Specials. This is not it. If you're looking for what sounds like an old cover band (lacking in emotion and going through the motions) this is most definetely for you.
4,Best in its price range,"I've been a Rembrandt fan for a long time now; so far these are the best whitening strips that I've found in its price range. The strips are TEN times better than any others; instead of having those cheap, flimsy clear little strips that glide off easily, these mold to the shape of your teeth and are literally STUCK on there (don't worry, they're easy to remove). I also like how they have individual cut-outs for each tooth so you cover the sides of the tooth too, not just the flattest part on the front.I only gave it 4 stars because I've recently tried the Crest 3D Whitening strips and those work amazingly. However, they're a bit strong and do make your teeth hurt if you have sensitive teeth (even if you think you don't), and they're also double the price of these. I'm sure you would get the same results if you bought 2 of these; it'd just take longer because they're not as strong (sometimes that's a good thing)."
2,Not for sensitive teeth,"I am sure this product works fantastic for those who do not have sensitive teeth. In fact, I know it works great because my brother AND my dentist use it and they have incredible smiles. However, I do have sensitive teeth and this is just one more thing I spent money on, that I could not use. I put it on for 30 minutes per the directions, and was in utter discomfort for nearly 12 hours after. The level of discomfort was incredible. Unfortunately, I have not found the whitening product for me. I am hopeful that some day, a whitener will be invented, that does not hurt. I will be the first in line :)Rembrandt Whitening Strips for Teeth Whitening, Mint Flavor, 14 ea"
5,What a Jewel!,"I know everyone has purchased a CD sound not heard and wanted to return it asap! Well, this is not one of those.We found this CD on a visit to Guam. I hadn't heard of it but took a chance on the title alone. What a find!I must say that I was most impressed by each and every selection on the CD. The music took me to black and white films where dancing with your partner was the thing to do.Caldonia was a huge hit with our 11 year old son. Each cut on ""Original Swingers"" is clear, full of rythm and each song has a story to tell as in the song, ""And Her Tears Flowed Like Wine"", and some of the songs are just funny, like ""Cole Slaw"".This has been our best music purchase all year."
1,Boring and Overated,"Okay I read this book awhile back,when I was 17,and unless they rewrote it I don't understand all the praise this book is getting.This book was so boring that if it had a voice it would be monotone.Also I was the same age as the main character of this book when I read it and I still couldn't relate to it.None of the characters are at all relatable and even worse completely unlikeable.Plus,I kept waiting for the story to pick up and go somewhere and it just never happened. I don't know maybe I'm just not introspective enough but I hated it."
1,I gave up,"Maybe it's me, but after reading the first 100 pages, I gave up on this book. The narrator's voice simply did not ring true for me. This inauthenticity stems from the fact that his expressed thoughts and endless self-analysis sound more like a writer's ruminations than the feelings of a 17-year-old. (The problem is even worse when the character remembers incidents from his childhood at age 5 and 11.) With minimal plot development and the only tension coming from cliches, I put it down and couldn't bring myself to pick it up again."
4,Interesting History,"I really enjoyed reading Black Texans! It gave me, an African American living in Texas, a lot of in depth history and insight to the journey of the black person, especially in Texas. It is not biased and is not written in a negative tone. The book does not even portray other races in negative light. It simply tells the facts as they are. I recommend this to book to everyone."
4,Good Tale of Good vs Evil!,"Fifties police drama with lots of suspense. An honorable assistant DA vs two medaled policemen, and ultimately versus the whole City. Fun, exciting, believable and a quick read. I recommend you read this is you like good old fashioned good vs evil and white hat vs black drama."
2,some interesting commentary-but too small at 6.5 by 5 inches,"I love looking at old ads and this book has lots of them. There is a modest amount of interesting and humorous commentary, as well as factoids spread throughout. The bulk of the book, however, is the magazine ads, grouped two to four per page. A few ads are given bigger treatment. The problem I have will be obvious to anyone over 40: It is too small. The copy is very hard to read, and that makes it terribly frustrating. Apparently, the publishers predicted only young people would be interested in magazine ads from the forties thru sixties. Maybe coffee table size was proposed but thought to ambitious. I just can't read these cool little ads."
4,Pretty good,I realy enjoy the TV series. Well directed and well written. Too bad the books are so incredibly bad.
4,TVD S1,My only nitpick with the dvd is that there are no commentaries from the cast. I hope they remedy that with S2. I LOVE the show so there's nothing much else to say.
3,Great Music,"That's about all there was that held my interest in this first episode. I loved all of the music that they played, but I could see right away that it would get caught up in all of the teen angsty soap opera-ness that is the WB or CW as it has been renamed."
3,Vampire Diaries,Nice try but not willing to pay that much for a one season DVD. Guess I will just wait for e-bay to offer.
5,LOVE THIS SHOW!,I absolutely love this show! The DVD came quickly and was in fantastic condition! Thanks!
5,"Adult Reviewer. VERY Impressed! NOT a ""tweeny series"".","I admit I was skeptical. The title alone had me thinking this would be another Twilight type disappointment and I am a huge fan of True Blood. Vampire Diaries is very well written, well acted and has a great story! I could not get into Twilight as the main girl cast Bella simply cannot act! She could not even cry when the love of her life breaks it off with her? And yes, I did read the books. Anyhow back to Vampire Diaries. There is a ton of Drama, Action and Suspense to keep you entertained. This series stars off at High School but quickly and cleverly steers clear of High School and into more complex issues and problems. I give this five stars as it reminds me a little of Anne Rice but has it's own unique style and again a fantastic well thought out story. Don't miss out without giving this a shot. One episode and you will be very interested. One disc and you will be hooked! Thanks for reading :)"
2,Wasn't Impressed,I was not impressed with the pilot and probably will not watch again. It just wasn't entertaining as True Blood or Twilight. I think maybe we have enough different vampire shows to keep us entertained that we do not need another.
1,Absolutely Horrible,"Can we say unoriginal? I'm sure a lot of people are going to be suckered into this show because of the vampire craze. This show is not creative, and completely unoriginal. Way to go CW, your shows are terrible. Gossip Girl was great...when it was a book I read lets say...6 years ago. I can't believe someone could get away with a story line entirely too close to this other little book saga, Twilight..I'm not sure if you've heard of it."
1,Broken Item,I came home and saw the package; when I picked it up I heard a lot of noise. I opened the package and the wrap was torn in the edge so I shook the item and heard more noise. I then opened it and pulled the case out and it was COMPLETELY BROKEN! I am really disappointed and upset because this was going to be a Christmas present and it looks like it was run over and then placed in a wrap. Not what I PAID FOR :( !!!
4,I love vampires their out!!,Vampire diaries is a really good show with some FINE men to help to keep watching! Season two was really good more Damon with no shirt Please?!
5,Love this show!!,This is my favorite show. its NOTHING like Twilight and thats a good thing. Its so much more realistic and interesting
4,Grainy but good value for your money,I was a bit disappointed to see the quality of these movies. Thinking the producers would have done a little extra to bring out these titles. They were grainy and seem to be just a flat copy over from DVD. True the picture hadmore pop and more vibrant color but that is expected of all bluray transfers because of the higher bit rate. Sound was good though and due to this I felt keeping them was justifiable else I would have just kept my DVD's Top Gun and days of thunder. War Of The Worlds and Collateral is still decent flicks as well if the cost is worth it. As you can see I'm clearly mixed with this package.
1,Did not received what was promised,"Order 11"" Charizard Plush Toy. After four weeks went by, sent seller email for status. They said they were out-of-town and agreed to expedite shipment for no extra charge (thanks.) Received toy in one month and three days. It is not an 11"" Charizard, it is a 5"" toy that is commonly available on eBay for $3.99 plus shipping. I paid $25 plus shipping. I sent email to seller, but have not received reply. Cannot recommend seller. Feel like I was taken for a ride. Ten-year-old daughter doesn't understand why her allowance money is gone and she didn't get what was promised."
5,Perfect case for P9 and similar cameras,This case is so good that it makes DSC-P9 and similar Sony models worthy buy just to own this case. It fits the camera perfectly well and has a small case that can be attached to the strap to hold extra baterry or memory sticks. The zipper around the bag pulls out with a strap and is so convenient to operate if you have it on your waist belt. Inside of the bag there is another strap to prevent the case from completely opening apart that might cause the camera to fall down.The case as a shiny finish to the hard material that can prevent you camera from damage when you drop it down.
4,The maximum in rare dance classics!,"This is an excellent bargain-priced CD containing hard-to-find classic 12-inch dance mixes. It includes tracks like The Reynolds Girls' ""I'd Rather Jack"", The Three Degrees' ""Heaven I Need"", Jason Donovan's ""Too Many Broken Hearts"", and especially the very rare songs like Barbara Mason's ""Another Man"" and Sharon Brown's ""I Specialize in Love"". I'd love to see them release more of these CD's and feature other impossible-to-find Eurodisco classics like Christina's ""Come and Get It"", Fire on Blonde's ""Wrong Number"", Spagna's ""Call Me"" and Promise Circle's ""Easy To Touch"" (to name a few). I can wish, can't I?"
3,The 80's are Happening All Over Again,"This tasty little CD contains some long-lost remixes of late '80's dancefloor Euro-classics. Lonnie Gordon, Mel & Kim and the Reynolds Girls are all here in their Stock-Aiken-Waterman glory. Worth the price alone for the extended version of Jason Donovan's classic 'Too Many Broken Hearts'."
4,Greta Lite for craft room,I bought this fro my wife as a Christmas present. She is a card maker and needs good light. She really likes the true color effect she gets from this light. Its easy on her eyes.
2,OUCH!,"I apologize for the low rating...but, none-the-less, it is needed. As I go through my ""used"" lab book, I realize that nobody QC'd this product. It is missing several lab sections, not to mention some being pre-filled. Buyer beware!"
3,bought as a gift - doesn't work too well,"Bought for someone as a gift - didn't work too well, but they got it to work after moving around the battery. seems to work ok now."
4,Kids love it!,"We purchased this and the battery powered Thomas for our grandsons, and they love them. They said the engines could pull 12 cars on the kitchen floor. They haven't had them long, so don't know about durability."
2,Not that great,"We bought James last night while we already had battery operated Percy. James does not run as well on Melissa and Doug train track as he does on original Thomas train track. He is also more sensitive going around curves. It seems to be the middle wheel. As the middle wheel is loose and can float up and down, it seems to cause the train to get stuck at certain points along the track even while running on only original Thomas train track. Percy has no problems on either train tracks and never gets stuck.James does seem faster than Percy but that could be due to having a newer battery."
1,No Fun With James,"We have four battery operated engines (Thomas, Percy, Lady, James) and James was the last one purchased. James can not make a complete circle without derailing. Also, he can't make it up one of the low Thomas drawbridges. It has nothing to do with the way our track is set up because we did it according to manufacturer's instructions. Even in our own custom set up we removed all small curved track and James had serious problems. Even when Thomas didn't. There is no consistency from engine to engine. It is disappointing."
2,Not easy to spin up,"This gyro is a lovely toy, but found it difficult to spin-up using the geared plastic pull cord. It tended to 'skip' gears and slide if pulled too vigorously, so left gyro with low spin up, which quickly spins down. Trying demos as pictured, like one gyro balanced on the other's axis, lasted a few seconds. Tried pulling with string, not much better results, so kind of disappointed. Though, it's still a pretty toy."
3,Gyroscope,"Not as solidly and well made as I had hoped. The gymbals seem not quite tight enough, and the motion seems rattly and not smooth enough as a result. I like the little strap to get it started - seems better than old-fashioned string."
4,A funny toy,"A funny toy,I like it very muchCMy daughter also likes to play with this toy.However, the plastic part is very easily damaged"
1,a total waste of time,"poorly written, another skam by Turdeau to just take one's money. This was a mistake to purchase I have learned a lesson"
2,Chess Mysteries is no Mystery.,"THE CHESS MYSTERIES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES by Raymond M. Smullyan was predictable from beginning to end. Immediately Dr. Smullyan admits he doesn't like or play chess yet proceeds to use chess as a vehicle to demonstrate 'retrograde analysis' as though it were unique to chess. Any human being who has mastered his trade, craft, or profession has probably routinely reconfigured his work to identify a prior characteristic. Retrograde analysis is common to anyone skilled at their occupation and the adroit have no need to read this book to learn a commonly acquired skill. (The unadroit will simply continue as they are.) I further think this book will disappoint both chess players and Sherlock Holmes fans, and contribute nothing for students of logic."
5,joy of discovery,"I think the 2-star reviewer misses the point of this book: it's supposed to be fun. And it is. The puzzles are pretty challenging, and it definitely helps if you play chess. You tend to notice positional abnormalities that are the bases of the problems. From there, it's just detective work.But the real treat to this book is the world the author creates. Smullyan's characters can't play chess for nuts. You should see the bizarre positions they come up with - it's as though they're making random moves. Yet this doesn't diminish their love of the game one bit. They're such gentlemen too. No one minds when Dr. Holmes interrupts to ask questions. His new friends are always polite and like nothing more than a good demostration of deductive reasoning. I wish I lived in their world."
5,Great fun listening,Terrific CD for dancing or just background. Excellent selection and variety. Highly recommended. I bought 3 CDs of Cafe Accordian and love them all.
3,Misinformation,"I have not read this book as yet (which is why it has three stars), but I have read many reviews, on both pagan and Wiccan websites. I have a few things that I would like to bring up.Too many people believe the information given blindly by those of other religions. Christianity is a wonderful religion that holds up decent guidelines for its believers to follow. Wiccan, on the opposite end of the spectrum belief-wise, is a nature-based religion whose main creed (the Wiccan Rede) is ""An it harm none."" Witches use magick, yes, but not to harm anyone. In this particular scenario, I believe the suffering party is the Wiccans, while the instigator is poor misinformed Ruth Brown."

5,A piano legend!,"Arturo Benedetti Michelangeli incarnated during many years the aristocratic mood in piano playing. Architectonic refinement, meditative phrasing without any single bit of delirious Romanticism. His performances are contemplative rather than visceral, he played the piano like an entomologist , searching the perfect balance of musicality and expression. His limpid phrasing and specially one of his most reminded personal trademarks: to leave the bar floating to create an introspective atmosphere.If you are looking for a hyper Romantic Chopin, forget about it. Michelangeli enhanced and expressed wisely new angles of performing the beloved son of Poland.I would like to remark, there are other players who has followed this fabulous approach; Alfred Cortot, Samson Francois, Ivan Moravec (pupil of Benedetti) and Dinu Lipatti, among the most representative ones."
5,A very sweet story with,"characters that you like immediately. How Ms. Osborne managed to create a female lead that was so unattractive to start and then became so well loved and desired is the gift of her pen. If you enjoy books that tell a beautiful story and fill that story with much detail about their lives and their surroundings, then Maggie Osborne is the one for you."
3,workds good,well it unlocks and locks but the panic button works when you press down on it hard.. and i thought this remote would also allow you to start the car remotely but it doesnt my previous remote did but oh well its still good.
5,it has everything,"This is the end all be all of forensic entomology books. It was the first written in its field, and the science and knowledge within its pages still holds true today. It is highly reccomended for anyone involved in crime scene investigation or entomology. It is really not for the squeemish, however."
4,Straightforward Naderisms...,"Although this book is sort of dated by now it is still packed with detailed facts dreived from some of Naders works and speaches...regardless of whether or not you like the man, this book does present much factual and empirical backgroud to some little known events in U.S. history...If you love Nader, you'll enjoy the book. If you don't, you'll likely still learn something that you didnt know before or at least you'll have some new material for further research...you wouldn't be looking to buy this if that wasn't your aim anyway...for the price its well worth it."
3,"Great Form of Calcium, But...","This is pure calcium citrate, in powder form. It mixes easily, and is well assimilated by the body. I was surprised though, how much powder there actually is in a tsp, which is less than the recommended dose. It doesn't dissolve in water. It does turn your glass of water into a white chalky drink. It's tasteless, but it's gritty and is tough for me to get down. If you regularly drink fruit smoothies or similar, this may work fine for you, but I'm going back to Citracal."
2,Some Real Problems Here,"Well OK, there are some nice things about this gadget. I find it very compact and I like the keyboard and the fact that it has a word processor and spread sheet. However, after endless amount of time writing to Sonic Blue (the staff were incredibly unhelpful and didn't seem to care about my problem at all), consulting with friends etc, my Diamond Mako still does not talk to my computer (my operating system is Windows 98). BIG PROBLEM!"
3,Diamond Mako/Psion Revo Plus - Mac woes,"Outstanding hardware and software in a compact, highly usable form. Still rates only a 3 star rating in my world because of the near total lack of Mac connectivity support. To get it to connect you need a serial port Mac (they no longer exist - pay $50 to install an optional add-on) and MacConnect software (another $60-70). For that you get only file backup but no file conversion - that's only supported on Windows. Using VirtualPC did not work at the connectivity end but can be used for file conversion purposes with a little juggling...Tech support ranges from brusque to eminently helpful. Jason Leverett of PsionUSA (although he sounded Scottish and may actually be at the Home Office in the UK or Taiwan or China or wherever) - thank you for solving a non-working disk issue in 15 seconds with a quick email attachment."
4,Neat kid's book,"My 6-year-old niece flipped out when I gave her this book. She LOVES Georgia O'Keefe, which I think is hilarious, but she can't stop talking about the artist and her work."
4,Very pretty; poetical,"Almost a knock-off of Jeanette Winter's ""My Name is Georgia."" Both books are somewhat poetical; not biographies exactly. Good illustrations in both books -- you can tell both artists really have a feeling for Georgia O'Keefe. I'm lumping them together because they are so similar, down to the quotes they used."
2,Not Really A Good Value,"I purchased these speakers for my Dad's computer. For regular computer work and cd audio they are fine. Although, for the money you can do better with a little searching. The two star only rating was due to the massive distortion and humming encountered when using headphones. I had to return them due to the need for headphone use."
4,good guide for the shy at heart,"The book is written in a very nurturing style, has exercise pages for self reflection and motivates you to keep going despite obstacles.Small enough to be read during break or while waiting for an appoinment.It has a bio of women from the past who over came odds and succeeded. A must have for your libary."
4,Outside temp doesn't always register,"I'm very happy with this product, despite the fact that it does not always register the outside temp. I get dashes instead of numbers every couple days, haven't figured out yet what may be interfering with it, but pushing the down arrow for a few seconds gets it searching for the signal again and it always registers when I do that.I live in a cold area and am hoping the lithium batteries really do let it register those temps below -4 degrees this winter (unless, better yet, we don't have those this year!).Good product for the money."
3,Zen Wave,This book is an early work by a respected and cherished Zen adept. For this reader it lacks depth and breadth but should appeal to a beginner.
5,An amazing story about a truly exceptional man,"I must admit that I only recently became interested in the Apollo program as it was somewhat before my time. However, I am fascinated by the life of Neil Armstrong. I recently read an article about how he is a true superstar, unlike the ""Michael Jacksons"" of the world. One hundred years from now, school kids will know who Neil Armstrong was and what he did. It's a great story about a man who was not seeking fame or fortune, but had it thrust upon him. However, he handled it with grace an humility. A truly remarkable man."
2,not enough pictures,i wanted a book that showed pictures of neil armstrongs life as he moved through his career as an astronaut. this was all text and very few pictures. i should send it back.
5,Triumph!,"This book is a triumphant success. Never before has Neil Armstrong been revealed with such clarity and dimension. As Walter Cronkite said in his quote for the book, this is a book for all time, not a fly-by-night pulp fiction piece meant to appeal to the madding crowds but to those who want a meticulously researched, historiographically informed, three-dimensional portrait of a 20th century man who was first and foremost an engineer--a portrait that can be given with respect to our grandchildren and to posterity."
3,Good book on the basics,"This book comes in between Wilmott and the more technical books.And its by no means complete, if you want a more comprehensive treatment you may want to buy wilmott.And if you need something more technical you shouldget the book by Oskendal and/or Nielsen.If you want to get an inexpensive book then go for this."
5,It's all about the mathematical finance!,"As the title says, you can get both concepts and practice of mathematical finance without strong mathematics background. The author covers every aspects from the basic trees and BS to the LIBOR market model.It is not plain as much as Hull (1999) Options, Futures & Other Derivatives or Neftci (2000) An Introduction to the Mathematics of Financial Derivatives etc. Also you don't have to get sick of heavy mathematics as much as Karatzas and Shreve (1991) Brownian Motion and Stochastic Calculus or Steele (2000) Stochastic Calculus and Financial Applications. (Strictly speaking, the latter ones are about stochastic calculus not mathematical finance.)In addition, you can find the ""Further reading""-relevant references with comments at the end of the most chapter. It drives you to read relatively recent research/papers in depths.I don't know whether it is a great book for practitioners. However, Joshi's book is definitely one of the must-read item for quant wannabe."
5,i love this,this absolutely captures and directs debris. it was was a total mess before.extremely easy to attach. saves so much clean up time.
5,Cute Music,"This CD is essentially a soundtrack of the first season for the Card Captor Sakura TV show. The CD is pretty much like any other anime soundtrack. The extended beginning and ending themes are there. It also includes the background music of the show which sound sweet by itself. If you are a fan of the show like I am, I would recommend this CD."
1,An absolutely worthless book.,"The author is not sure as what area of the systems he wants to focus on - system admin or programming, introduction or advanced features. And if this book is meant for UNIX professionals, I don't understand why he goes on describing concepts of UNIX, which he does in an absolutely lousy way. The book is so worthless that I feel it is waste of time writing review of this book."
2,Not a great effort,"Simply put, Cura does not use his powerful voice to great effect. I've listened to his collection of Puccini arias where his strength finds better application. I even liked him in the TV production of La Boehme. But sadly, there appears to be no real interpretation in this recording, just sound. It's like listening to a horn player who can create a great sound from the instrument, but can't make music."
4,Great Improvement,I'm very satisfied with this CD it shows great improvement...but he has a long way to go....I can see Cura being one of the best tenors of our time.....but he need serious work...first i think he should either choose.....conducting or singing....both is not a good combination at least for now....we can see this from the last CD...and not as much on this one...but still...his timber is great...with a booming quality...his passion for music seeps into his singing!! his alfredo is great!
3,Room for Improvement,"My infant is very happy to sit in this vibrating bouncer all day, however, there is room for improvement. It does not really support him well, I had to purchase one of those headrest things that I use in it while he's still so small. He also slides down in the seat after a little while. The thing this has been the best for is that it is a pretty good incline, which helps a lot with his reflux problems...sometimes the bouncy seat is the only thing we can get him to sleep in. It's also nice to always have a blanket right there. However, if I were to choose again, I'd probably go with the baby papasan or something that provides more support."
2,"Nice net, but brackets appear weak","The net is really nice, but the brackets seemed to be a cheap brittle plastic with a weak point that looked like it would be very likely to break. I returned it."
2,Didn't work well on Linux box,"This was not a good keyboard on my Linux box at work. Every few dozen keystrokes, it would lock up and continuously repeat whatever character was last typed. Quite a nightmare.Could have been the USB drivers under Linux, but I doubt it..."
3,A Little Small,"I bought this for my 5 year old who loves football and the Chicago Bears. The football was smaller than I anticipated. There is no on or off for the sounds which is annoying when you are playing catch with it and there is no way of changing the battery without ripping it apart. The neat thing about it is it plays a clip of the Chicago Bear fight song and one of the other clips is ""dah Bears""."
4,Pre-teen Book,"This is a reasonable version for a first exposure to the story of the Spanish Armada. The author is careful to mention all of the major names involved - Drake, Howard, Hawkins, Parma and Medina Sidonia. He, also, provides some background on the naval technology of the time, as well as, the background for why the Armada was formed.Given that this is a child's book, it is understandable that the author shies away from most of the questionable aspects of the history, with the small exception of Drake's foray to capture his prize in the middle of the battle. The pictures add some color to the story and should provide some help to young minds in understanding the story. All in all, not a bad first exposure to the topic.P-)"
2,Great if it had stuck to the window,"This had a great look on my truck, but on the 3rd day while I was going down the freeway, it just blew right off. Perhaps being removable isn't good for this type of product."
3,Palette Charm by Rembrandt Charms,"This is a beautiful charm, but it is much smaller than I anticipated. The charm is actually smaller than the picture!"
3,Good reference but lacks detail,"This book is good to use as a general reference but is also frustrating to use because it lacks some critical details. On many remote hikes it lists major road junctions but not the mileages from the main road--i.e., is it 50 miles from the main road or five miles? Also, while the descriptions of the hikes are very well written they can also be misleading because the author has not actually completed a lot of the hikes. For example, The Black Canyon Trail in Eastern Oregon does offer solitude but it is also riddled with rattlesnakes and range cows! The latter does not make for a very nice wilderness experience."
3,"Many trails, pretty decent descriptions.","As a general reference for the Oregon/Washington area this book has a lot to offer. Reasonably thorough descriptions and ratings for a lot of trails. The few regional key-maps included are awful. In fairness to the authors, that's a lot of hikes, but these maps are really useless and inaccurate. Also, beware that the references to USGS 7.5' quadrangles can be erroneous as well. Don't order maps from your USGS supplier until you confirm the ones you need from another source. I'd recommend this book to someone who's not sure where they want to go yet. Once you decide, a more detailed guide for the specific area would be preferred. But it's an informative way to get started if you're unfamiliar with the region."
2,Do not rely on this as a guide.,"I have attempted to do more than 100 hikes in this book -- 90% in Oregon. At least 30% of the trails do not exist or the driving directions were so poor you could not find the trailhead -- and some you simply could not get to in a standard vehicle. The descriptions were not accurate. It seems like the author wrote by using maps, not by visiting the trails. I ended up using a few of the pages to start a fire on one of the hikes. That was the best use I got out of the guide.Some information was reasonable."
3,An A for effort,"Though not the best zombie movie ever made it is, by far, not the worse either. In fact there where enough erie and comical elements in this movie to make this short worth watching. What can be more funny then a bunch of prison inmates, I guessing somewhere in the south, sniffing formadelhyde to get high, breaking out of prison, being shot, buried and returning as zombies.....possibly because of their formaldehyde? The scariest part is when they come across a trailer that the girlfriend/wife of one of the inmates lives in. The stand around staring in the windows with a great deal of erie delight! Enjoy this scene, it's the best cinematography in the entire flick. The climax of the entire film, however, falls short. In fact there was more excitement in the middle of the movie then during the 'big finish'. Still worth a look though."
3,Functional but clunky.,"My steel spatula had been misplaced (guests helping with dishes!) and I got pretty desperate so I bought this thinking it was the same size as my hidden spatula. I should have looked at a ruler. This is pretty big. Not very useful in a fry-pan, but good on griddle for eggs, pancakes, etc. Large handle gives it a somewhat clunky feel."
5,Beautiful paper dolls & costumes!,"We used this book of paper dolls as inspiration for dance costuming representing Ancient Egypt in a presentation at our local zoo's fundraiser ""Caravan through Ancient Egypt"". Beautiful paper dolls and costumes...excellent quality!"
2,Not The Handbook Promised,"Unfortuantely, this book does not outline the ""proven strategies"" for enhancing luck. One must plow through many boring term-paperesque pages of studies of lucky people and tired anecdotes. While the author touches on different techniques, ie, lucid dreaming, meditation, etc, he does not outline those processes. There is a minor description of a prayer technique buried in the latter half of the book. I would have preferred more technique and less patter.The author does have a website which hawks two cds and a newsletter. I have listened to the second CD which actually has exercises to enhance luck, which are promising if basic. I suggest you skip the book and get the exercise CD."
1,"OK, so other people have luck...","..but, honestly, did anyne who read this book get more luck...? I doubt it. It's a series of anecdotes about the author and others who ""felt"" it at one time or another...not practical at all."
5,The marriage of physics and metaphysics...,"This book is a fast, fun, and interesting read...I could not put it down. Fitzgerald took a subject close to my heart after 30 + years of personal experience and research and actually included information new to me! In a time when so many feel burdened with obligations in the world, I think this book gives people a great sense of hope and optimism about their lives."
4,Face to Face,A memorable plot line with enough tension to keep its grip on you. The characters are well developed and come to life. A story that offers hope to the heart of wounded souls.
4,best band of hell,"Nurse with wound posessed the power in the late 70's and early 80's to conjure a European nightmare through music. Until Wolf Eyes inception, America never had a band that could give an auditory illustration of a nightmare. they do it with every concievable item that can be used as a musical instrument. They create a grimey, fuzz ridden industrial portrait of urban America.Wolf Eyes horrific sound is not for everyone. It is mainly for fans of the aforementioned Nurse with Wound, Whitehouse and emil beaulineau.This is a good place to start in the vast Wolf Eyes catalogue"
5,My grand son spend hours putting it on the track and pulling other trains with it.,"Great for 2 year old and up, My grand sons play with this train and others to the set constantly."
3,"My son loved it, until it broke :(","My 2 year old is a serious Thomas fan. He loved this battery powered train. While it's pretty durable, ours completely stopped working after only 2 months. The motor just wore out and came to a halt on the tracks one day. We were very disappointed. My son was heart broken and I was annoyed because these are not cheap. We will probably buy another one because it was one of his favorite toys. I just expected better quality from such an expensive toy."
2,The only Thomas pc. that has disappointed us,"My son was initially thrilled to get this addition to his figure eight set, but once the novelty wore off, it seemed like more aggrevation that it was worth. For starters, once he saw battery operated Thomas do his thing, my son no longer wished to push the trains around the track himself. The durability is not great - we are about to return our second to Learning Curve. The second was even worse than the first - after only a few turns around the track it would not go up ascending track even by itself. This would frustrate my son considerably. The noise it creates is also considerable for such a small toy. Again, the second was worst than the first. We adore all our other pieces but my recommendation would be to skip this one and let your children push their own toys! --Update - We are about to send back Thomas for the third time. My son has grown tired of his always broken battery operated Thomas and has gone back to pushing his own trains."
1,Broke very quickly,"Broke down very quickly, because it is not possible to push it, the gears are engaged and when the power is switched off and pushed it grinds the gears. Some it started getting jammed very quickly, it would take a lot of hassle to get it going on its own again. I guarantee this will break very quickly, unless you do not let your kid play with it."
3,Too loud and underpowered,"We have two of the big BRIO battery engines, and they really pull the trains around. This Thomas train is underpowered and simply can't make it up the hills; plus it is incredibly loud with a brain-numbing ""grinding"" sound as it chugs.This train frequently takes a ""time out"" on top of the refrigerator."
3,works fine but no good surprises,I was encouraged to buy a webcam by my stepdaughter. When it came I had to install it twice just to see what it would do. The documentation is scarce and hard to use for a neophyte like me.And one person I was using it with said it kept cutting out and I had to restart it many times.I don't think this technology is very mature yet. It works OK but there are pitfalls.

5,The CD with the only known recording of Aleister Crowley,"""Aleister Crowley - The Great Beast Speaks"" is a CD with the only known recording of Crowley. It includes both his poetry and Enochian Calls.Tracks marked ""Enochian version"" are recited in the magical language discovered and used by ""John Dee"", magician to the court of queen Elizabeth. Enochian is not mere gibberish; it is a real language with a grammar and syntax of its own. Perhaps it is, as more than one occultist has claimed, a degenerate from of drowned Atlantis.Although this recording has previously been avaliable as a ""bootleg"" this is the first official release and to the label's knowledge, contains the only known recording of Crowley. We believe the original recording was made circa 1920 on a wax cylinder. Although digitaly enhanced, surface noise may be evident.Address in the CD box: M.O.D. PO Box 2903, London N1 3NE"
3,"Terrific Musicians, poor writers and composers","As wonderful as it is to hear these fine musicians play their instruments, there isn't a single song with words or music memorable enough that I want to listen to it again. None will withstand the test of time and become classics."
5,New Songs Right on Target,"I bought this cd for my husband and he loves it. It includes lots of new songs that really ring true for him. Some make him chuckle. He especially likes ""Nothin' Special,"" in which the message is "". . my interest don't fall in monetary desires just a steady dose of passion baby's all I require."" ""Keep Her While She's There"" and you won't have to get her back when she's gone. Also, you'll feel a lot better, ""When It Stops Hurtin'."" Del McCoury's voice is an acquired taste, but this collection is excellent."
5,Pretty Cool!,"We got it for our mom's birthday. She LOVES it! Her favorites are the Weather 'channel' and email. Pretty simple to use. Although it can't handle all attachments, it suits most of the mail she gets! Pretty cool to know how to dress for the day!Hopefully they will add more scheduling options. I think it would be nice to have email checked more than channels... I think most of the channels are boring myself. But, it's not mine. :)"
5,great cd,"this cd is very good. i especially love ""cats on mars"". I would highly reccomend this for anyone who likes cowboy bebop. this cd is is good for the young and the old...just anyone who likes good music. on a note: don't try to understand what she's saying on ""cats on mars"" and ""fantasie sign"""
2,An interesting look into Boston's comedy clubs,"This was a good documentary on the history of two local comedy clubs in Boston. Since I am not from Boston, never been to Boston, and never will ever go to Boston, it was good for a one time viewing only.I agree with others that the cover of the DVD is misleading. I think that they purposely designed it to look like these people are actually performing routines, as an attempt to sell more copies, nationwide. Most people are pretty self centered and could care less about local comedy in an area other than their own.I give it two and a half stars. I thought that it would actually have some funny scenes in it and was disappointed when there was not any."
5,Du vol...pour les cowboys!,"Avez-vous déjà vu un CD double et un DVD avec plus de deux heures de matériel (vidéoclips, ""musicographie"" et neuf extraits de spectacle) pour 20.00$??? a ne serait pas cher pour un album de Michèle Richard. Imaginez maintenant que c'est un disque des Cowboys Fringants!!! c'est pas compliqué, c'est du vol pour le groupe! Pour ceux qui ont manqué la tournée de ""Break Syndical"" (comme moi), c'est un ""must"". Pour ceux qui ont vu le spectacle, c'est une bonne archive pour vos yeux. Pour les autres, c'est une excellente occasion de faire connaissance avec le groupe Québécois de l'heure et des années à venir. Merci aux Cowboys Fringants!"
4,"A Companion Read To GUNS, GERMS, AND STEEL","If you like books that offer explanations for humankind's big questions, this book attemps such. Depending on how much stock you put in Harrison's well-conceived and sufficiently supported (in my opinion) thoery, it can be construed to either add to or take precedence over Diamond's GUNS, GERMS, AND STEEL. I think together these books help to explain the world's current political situation (mess). Unlike Diamond's ""geography is fate"" analysis, much can be accomplished politically to correct Harrison's ""culture is fate"" explanation. Culture relativists, hackneyed liberals, and Bushian neo-cons will all take offense - that in itself may be sufficient reason to read it. The writing and editing could have been better, but because there were many contributors this is somewhat excusable."
