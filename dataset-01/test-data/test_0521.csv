4,Very well organised,"I read this book twice, I practiced a little bit on a C6509 (no C1900 at disposal as required by test), I passed the Switch 2.0 with 890/1000, first time. The book is perfectly organized, complete and clearly written, at least in relation with the Cisco test.Suggestion: I was really astonished to find so a big amount of errors in case studies (end of each chapter) so it's better to spend your time doing your own trials."
1,full of errors. Don't waste your time.,Don't waste your time. This book was so full of errors that it become confusing. The explanations do not match the diagrams. I had to make so many corrections to this book that I should have been paid to edit it. Surprized it's still on the shelf.
5,Wonderful Book!,"My husband and I purchased both A is for Adam and D is for Dinosour in the hard cover for our children and both the kids and us LOVE these books, the kids really love the pictures in this book and I think the story is just wonderful. There is also a colorable version of the book in the back of the book, rather than letting the kids color the book I have used it to make many coloring sheets with my copier but I think its just great that they made it that way!"
5,Great Book,"I have read many books on investing and would have to say Sy has covered many topics that you don't see in most. Sy gives you a good look at how the securities industry works and a system for investing that is easy to implement. He addresses the fact that there is risk in the market, something most investors don't seem to respect. It is written very clearly making it an easy read. If you are looking too learn more about investing, do yourself a favor and read this book. Not only could it make you money, it could save you money as well."
3,Building bbqs,"There were not too many books on the market when I decided to build my own barbque. This book helped me understand what I was getting myself into, but it fell short of giving me all the information I needed for my project. But it was a good resource. 3 out of 5 stars!"
3,Lots of material but a struggle to read,"As I'm sure many others have done, I've read a fair amount of history on the American Civil War. I've studied individual battles, unit histories and read countless diaries. However, I've read only a few studies of the events leading up to or following the war.Mr. Foner has done a masterful study of the subject let there be no doubt. And for those of you who are more educated than I, you'll likely enjoy it more than I did. My rating is due to how I enjoyed the book and I'm not making a judgement on the text from an academic point of view. I really think it was just way too much for me.Mr. Foner does have another book on the subject: A Short History of Reconstruction that may be better suited to you if, like me, you want to know what happened without getting bogged down by an overload of information."
3,A Novel That Doesn't Know What It Wants to be!,"After reading the author's first work, I kind of knew what to expect. The setting of the novel (Savannah, GA) is lovely. The plot follows the life of a spy and his settling into ""common"" life after WWII. This is a novel about the past and its impact on the present."
1,Can you select zero stars?,"It's one thing to write a book trashing Los Angeles, it's another to be unoriginal. The only thing worth noting is the author's apparent lack of awareness that her behavior and attitude is exactly what *everyone* doesn't like about LA.PS: If you are a fan of Jennifer Beals, she is extensively quoted here."
4,Very good way to score your mental game and keep focus.,I found their technique very useful and showed an immediate improvement in my score and enjoyment of the game. The program is simple to use and keeps you focused. Let's you go over a round and analyse where you succeeded mentally.
2,What they actually sell DIFFERS from the picture you see here.,"I purchased those from Auto Barn and the wheel covers I received were NOT as they looked on the Amazon picture.I have good nice RIO wheel covers on my car and I know exactly how they look like. I never had any problems with those, they are strong, never had any cracks.All I needed is 4 more exactly the same, but they are NOT.The package they sent me had a picture of the good wheel covers (like on Amazon), but what was inside was DIFFERENT. They were UGLY.I would never buy it if I saw the REAL picture."
4,Informative,This a good textbook. It has definitely helped me in my class. It has a few grammatical and spelling errors. The authors did a good job with research and definitions. I like how they explain terms and phrases.
2,An ok PPV,"This PPV wasn't the best WCW ever did, but it DID have some high spots:The only 2 things that i found appealing about this PPV were The match between Sting and Vampiro and the match between The Wall, and Shane Douglas. Both had some good and sick bumps (OMG!), and great endings. 8/10 for both matches. I'll just say one thing: Sting IS set on fier, and it gets ugly after that!!!Now...come on. 50 BUCKS? That's gonna go down in my journal as the biggest piece of (...) ever. If you really wanna get this tape...PLEASE WAIT!!!! I'm talkin 20 bucks AT THE MOST is all you will want 2 pay for this thing. Otherwise, I'd skip it. But, you can't go wrong with the matches I just explained."
2,"Dead on arrival, good customer service","Not much to say, the jack was heavier than expected but it is good looking and fairly easy to move around. I does not work !! I have followed the procedure to remove air and checked the oil level. The jack does not raise at all. Called customer service and left message. Will update as the case progresses. Customer service called back, and gave me a procedure to follow, the procedure made sense, but unfortunately did not fix my jack. Called customer service, left message, they immediately called back and offered to send me a new pump. Exellent solution. Will update when pump arrives."
3,Outlived 9 Lives,"This latest book in ""The Cat Who . . ."" series is another disappointment. While I found it more interesting than the previous novel, I wish that Braun would write as she once did. Koko and Yumyum used to play important roles. Now, it just seems like they're mentioned incidentally. This is the last book in the series I plan to read. Sorry, Koko; you're nine lives are up for this reader!"
3,Accepting the Inevitable,"I felt sad reading this book. I've realized that the days of Qwill and Koko actively participating in the solution of a murder mystery are over. I will continue to read any ""Cat Who"" books that may be published in the future, but I feel as though I'm watching a dear, old friend approach the end of his life.I thought Braun's question on the book jacket, ""Shall we try for twenty-six [books in the series]?"" was poignant. It's as if she's asking her readers if she should continue the series, seeking either encouragement to keep writing the books or permission to stop. Braun is now in her eighties and has low vision. Moreover, she wrote 21 of the 25 novels during the past 18 years. It's inevitable that time, age, and the sheer amount of physical and mental effort that such production requires will take their toll. I've adjusted my expectations of the books to fit this reality."
2,Time to wrap it all up...,"When the editor misses two entire pages where the writing lapses completely into first person and then reverts back (and it was not within Qwill's journal entry) and with so many meaninless forays that seem to be gratuitous for sentimentality's sake, I hate to think of where this series is heading. IMHO, this series reached its peak with ""The Cat Who Moved A Mountain"" and ""The Cat Who Wasn't There"" and has seriously declined in plot and writing quality over the last four books or so. I was a major fan of Qwill and his world, but I have to say, sad as it is, that I just don't care much anymore. The fire has gone out and this book has helped douse those flames. I am not even finished with it yet...I have about 1/4 of it yet to go, but I already see where this is going. It's not quite as meaningless as the last book, but it is quite close. The substance in this story seems superficial, and I am going to have to fight to finish this off."
1,This is the worst Cat Who... book yet!,This is the most boring book I've read in the series! I've read all her books and I couldn't wait to finish this one. I can't believe I finished it in the first place! It has no plot and you can tell who did it very early in the storyline (if you want to call it a storyline). I wouldn't waste money buying this one. Get it from your library! The rumors about this one being ghostwritten have got to be true. I can't imagine Braun writing like this!
3,I Wish,"The last two Cat Who books have not lived up to my expections. The reason for this is that I liked the way the cats took part in the story. Now the part Ko Ko takes is an afterthought. This new story is a bit better than the last, Quil at least doesn't stand in the middle of the story and order people around!I have all of the Cat Who Books and then some. This will likely be my last."
5,The Cat Who Brought Down the House,"I am a fan of the ""Cat Who..."" series by Lilian Jackson Braun. This is another ""candy"" book, meaning that I can pick it up for the pure enjoyment of a good yarn. No vulgarity, no violence, no sexual encounters with lurid detail... just a moment to enjoy a pretty good mystery."
5,Does the job without noticeable problems,"The cover fits well over a 12"" skillet. Being domed and not flat, it can accomodate a larger volume of food and still maintain an adequate seal. Works well, cleans up easily, and was reasonably priced."
2,Wish I hadn't bought it!!,"I don't know how the negative reviews escaped my attention; I normally look at them pretty closely before purchasing. If I had, I wouldn't have bought this! There is no central peg; each disk stacks on top of the other (very loosely) lego-style. The small red disk is too small; I won't be giving that piece to my daughter until she's much older (at which point the toy will probably no longer be interesting). Returning things is a hassle, and I think she'll enjoy chewing on the larger disks, so I'll keep it...but I wish I hadn't purchased it."
3,Spring Stampede 2000,"This was one of the best WCW payperviews ever! The only problem with the video is that it is edited very strictly. Anything even remotely profane has been removed and that kind of takes away from the ""live"" feel of the event. Still it is great to watch. The matches are well done and filled with intense high energy. Vince Russo and Eric Bischoff made quite a great creative team!"
1,Caution: windbag at work,"Nil desperandum est. This book is to mystery novels what Alma is to Gustav...better Xenophon to Themistocles. The very cornucopia fed to Incitatus; cui bonii optimii. Tartt is not one to wear her erudition lightly. Sophomoric quotes from Goddard to Suetonius to Chesterton leap from the pages to illuminate the most banal of thoughts. This is a book where you are in suspense until page 1. The following 600 serve to add luster to the one-dimensional characters until they arise, chrysalis like, into fully-fledged two dimensions. Some hostile reviewers believe that Tartt merely loaded the Oxford Dictionary of quotations into a blunderbuss and picked up the pieces in random, eulogizing one per half page. But that would be scurrilous and beyond the enmity of Agrippina equal, forse qui, to the misogyny of Polonius.If you like this review, you will love this novel. Otherwise, stay clear."
5,The closest thing to a perfect book I've read in a long time,"This book is simply mindblowing. The phrase ""it will chnage your life"" is often over used, but it fits this book perfectly. This is not to say that you'l drop your life and head to New England to study Greek, but you'll look at the world differently as you read the book. Think of the money you spend on it as an investment. I read it at least once a year and pass it on to my friends. Read it on a cloudy winter day and you can see yourself shivering in a warehouse with Richard. A brisk fall day and the leaves literally crackle under your feet.After I read the book I found myself identifying my friends as Bunnies, Henries, Richards, Francises, Charleses, and Camillas. If you finish this book and don't drop your jaw in amazement you've done something wrong."
4,This is a keeper!,I received this book as a BOOKCROSSING.COM release. While the cover makes it look like a romance novel (it's NOT) and the title's totally forgettable this is one of my favorite books of all time. I will be buying a copy for my own library very soon!The author makes you feel as though you've been welcomed into the characters' inner circle. I enjoyed it cover to cover and enjoy thinking what the characters may have done after the story ended.
5,amazing,"I absolutely did not want this book to end. I fell in love with the characters and the world the author created. I love that you know from the beginning what's happened, but you don't know why, and you're absolutely wrapped up in the mystery of it until the end. I can't wait to read it again!"
3,Here's a Secret - It's a Bit of a Let Down,"Overall this is a very interesting and engaging book, that ultimately does not live up to the hype. Within the first few lines of text you learn that a man has been murdered by his friends. The remaining 500+ pages recount the events that led up to the murder and deal with the aftermath. Tartt's tale is a dark one and her characters are shallow, complex, frustrating and unremorseful. Yet, she does a great job of keeping the reader interested and turning the page.Tartt falls short, however, at the end when things definitely take a bizarre and hard to substantiate twist. Furthermore, she spends too much time on the bit characters in her very last pages and not enough on the ones we loved to hate.Despite this, I think the book has more going for it than against it. Tartt is a talented writer, from whom we can likely expect more interesting stories in the future."
5,Loved it! Loved it! Loved it!,"This is my very first review for Amazon.com- prompted by that horrible Kirkus thing! I rarely read current novels- but I loved this book. I absolutely could not put it down or stop telling everyone I knew about it. Where is Donna Tartt now?The only other recent novel I felt the same way about was Posession by A.S. Byatt- so probably if you liked Possession, you will enjoy this too."
2,This book is painfully pretentious....,"I found myself irritated all the way through this overly long ""look at how clever I am"" style of writing. I found myself distracted from the story by the writing itself. She tried too hard, and it shows."
1,This book was TORTURE,"A bunch of psychopathic, elitist snobs spouting off esoteric references are bored and looking for some fun. So let's get all crazy, ala ""Altered States"" and oops, we killed a guy. What an inconvenience. And now we have to kill someone else bc he'll talk. How original. If this hadn't been my book club selection for this month, I would have sent it back to the library. I've read classics, and this ain't one of them. Just because the writer quotes Greek and uses long, have-to-read-it-twice sentences doesn't make it literature. I only wish this book had remained a ""secret"" to me."
2,Poop,I agree with the two star review elsewhere here that suggests what this book badly needs (editing). I relate to the anger of the one star reviewers though. I loved this book for the first few pages but ended up resenting its utterly cold wordy pretentious (etc) vacuity.
1,Wretched,"Thank God I borrowed this and didn't buy it. Pretentious, far too long, not a single likable character. The students come across more as inmates at a prep school for the emotionally and academically inept rather than an elite progressive college. This book wants its charcters to be dangerous and decadent and depraved and they're just silly, boring, spoiled children. Elizabeth Hand's ""Waking the Moon"" is a much better, though far more fantastic, novel about college students, mysterious rites, and the results thereof."
5,Socrates meets Generation X,"A truly awe-inspiring and entertaining novel, one which both wears its heart on its sleeve and its learning lightly. I couldn't put it down, but also I know that I will be revisiting it in my mind for a long time to come. I'm more of Julian's generation than of Henry's, Camilla's and Richard's, and yet I was entirely drawn in, to the world of sex, drugs, and alcohol that corrupts and finally destroys this group of young friends. My only wish: that I could go back to beginning and read it again without knowing what happens in the gripping and psychologically true denouement. I'm especially grateful to Donna Tartt that she held on to the end and didn't play games with the reader: I really did want to know what happened to every single character. In the end, a brilliant and satisfying book."
5,"One of the best-written, most engaging mysteries ever.","Donna Tartt spent eight years writing this novel, and I'llbet you will want to finish reading it in a day or two.When you're interrupted, you will think of little else butgetting back to the story. Before you've finished page two,you will know that you're reading an extraordinary work.The originality of the tale, its refreshing structure, andTartt's splendid use of language will enthrall you."
3,Death envelopes a New England college.,"This is a pretty good book, but I had expected so much more. It is the story of a death among several pretentiously precocious college students. None of the characters are particularly likeable, and I had trouble believing in them. They seemed like caricatures, archetypes, moved about on a chessboard of a plot. The book is full of small details which convince me that the author knows New England and college-life very well, but there is something distinctly unpleasant in spending an entire book with these people. I thought perhaps the characters would grow and come to some important self-realization as a result of their loss, but it seems to me that they simply diminish into wan spectralism. Basically the book reveals how the death affects the entire community, and there is certainly some interest to be found in watching how things unfold, but I was a bit disappointed overall with this story of hidden evil amidst superficial propriety."
3,Not what I expected,I bought this book for Book Club and it was not at all what I was expecting. It took awhile to get into it but get better along the way. It's not the typical read I prefer and definitely dark and disturbing in parts. I suppose I would recommend it but not for a happy reading. It helps to devote time to reading and not just reading here and there before bed - you will not follow the story as well.
4,Heart Pounding,"Anyone who didn't like this book has no idea what the true concept of excellent literature is! The characters in this book are compelling. Having never been a fan of suspense thrillers and mystery novels, upon reading this book I have learned to truly appreciate both the author and other novels of this type. Read this book, it will change the way you look at people."
2,"Oh, Sisyphus!","The prologue, and, arguably, the first chapter -- a masterpiece of literature, of stage-setting, of baiting the hook. A work of art. I was HOOKED.But then came the rest .... and I read Every. Single. Page .... pretentious, precious, elitist. And yes, throw pedantic onto the pile. I very quickly tired of Julian, Charles and Camilla, Francis, Bunny, and the poor-Plano-plebe-looking-in-from-the-outside Richard. I thought the supporting evidence for Richard's infatuation with these Paris-Hilton cohorts would emerge eventually, but they never did. I didn't understand how these characters stood out for Julian's elite picks. Nor did I ever find Julian to be anything other than the self-absorbed individual that he turned out to be.About halfway through, I prayed for the end. I silently pled to the author: Do whatever it is you intend to do with these ridiculous human beings and be done with it. Just release me, oh gods, from this cursed book."
4,Unputdownable. One of the best thrillers I have ever read,A very well structured thriller that keeps you chained down to it through the entire book. An amazingly good first novel. I can only hope that Ms. Tartt suceeds in keeping such high standard in the future. Kudos!
2,totally mediocre,"This book is totally mediocre. If you think ""Dead Poets' Society"" was a brilliant movie, you probably would enjoy this book greatly."
1,Pretentious Junk,"The slimy corporate maneuvering which produced this ""writer"" in publishing was as unwholesome as the one which produced that related creature in ""music"" Brittany Spears."
1,So bad I would have preferred reading a box of Cheerios,"What was the big deal about this book? Oh, yeah, it had a really great cover design when it came out in HC. Boring pap, insipid drivel, pointless navel-contemplation. In short: dreadful."
3,100 Words or Less,"Such a strange novel.It's not bad. Well written and good characters. Oh sure, in the middle, it seems interesting enough and there are a few surprises. Yet ... in the end, there's no real impact. After a couple of weeks, it was hard for me to even remember some of the details. After a month, most of the novel draws a complete blank.That only shows me how lacking in depth the whole story is. The characters are so esoteric and fringe, that their fate carries no meaning. I didn't really care that much."
4,Excellent American craftsmanship.,"I bought this Curt hitch receiver for my 07 Ford Ranger XL regular cab. It fits well and is absolutely beautiful. The weld seam is absolutely perfect(they use robots to weld their simpler hitches) and it has a nice gloss black powder coat finish. I strapped the hitch to my floor jack, which made installation much easier. All in all it is a great hitch for the price and made in USA to boot."
5,DVD from UK,I did not read where seller was from so took a little long to receive this DVD but the DVD was fine & great shape : I live in the US & this DVD WAS mailed from UK but seller assured me that it would play in my DVDI will read carefully next & buy only from USA just because of the lenght of time to receive this product
3,Who and What?,"Two women, gardeners, private ""dicks"" solve every crime under the sun. Sound good to you? Well, then you probably like Mid Summer Murder as well. For me I would like to use the DVDs in a skeet shooting contest."
2,Recording problems for good material.,"Performance: 3-4 stars. Even Herr Inbal whom some dislike. Sound: 1-2 stars, variable. Thin, wiry, aggressive, had to reset all 10 equalizer octaves controls to listen to very dry sound. In HAMLET, the sound of either a tape recorder turning loudly or vinyl needle-drop intrudes constantly and makes me ditch the whole thing. Might be OK for car stereos but there are more listenable compilations for material of this hastily-assembled bits and pieces of perhaps good vinyl of days gone bye and digitaliticized. ."
1,Hard,This cable was simply just to hard to twist due to the thickness or could be the material that its made of. Make sure the DVI connection on the back of your monitor is not facing down or sideways otherwise your going to have a hard time plugging it in.
1,More of the same,"Pointless guitar meanderings, poor vocals, no-taste arrangements, and all the subtlety of a flying toaster oven. Hey, Chubby: Guitar heroes are out, soulful blues is in. Pity poor Popa...even his best friends won't tell him he's a cornball. Too bad."
1,Not a single good exposure,Was so excited to get this film sooner than the shipping notification stated - in time for a big party! But not a single photo is good. ALL have totally undeveloped areas - some are 90% undeveloped. ALL have terrible colour. Total waste of a lot of money.
2,Polaroid Film,"Unfortunately I cannot rate this product as high as I should because the film itself was too large for the camera and so would not fit. I made the attempt to exchange the film by contacting the seller, but without success. I am sure it is a good product, I just cannot use it."
4,not cheap,"I've had this instant picture taking camera for over a decade. You just can't beat it for on-the-spot pics. Only prob, not making film anymore. Amazon was the lesser of the evils for purchase of the film. So I took out a loan, bought the film. Ha, ha."
5,Great Transaction,"This is an older book, which showed up in no time. It was well packages and in fine shape, as described by seller. I was very happy with this trasaction.Stu"
4,Gave me my sanity back!!!,"Prior to buying this monitor, I was up constantly checking my son's breathing. He is a very heavy sleeper and I was always worried he had stopped breathing. Though this is not a ""medical"" device and cannot prevent SIDS, it gave me peace of mind knowing the monitor would go off if my child stopped moving for over 20 seconds.Since having the monitor I have slept MUCH better. The alarm has only gone off a couple times and I think it was because he moved over to the edge of the crib off the pad. Or maybe he really did stop breathing and the alarm caught it and I shook him gently and roused him from it. I don't know. All I know is that I can sleep better having this monitor and whether it actually DOES anything or not, that is enough for me."
1,Living to the sound of a hummmm...,"The idea behind this is great, and to be fair it does work as advertized.However it emits a horrible hum at any volume. We knew this is an inherent risk in analog monitors, but our old Fisher-Price is silent when plugged into the same power outlets.In the end, we splurged for thePhilips SCD590 Digital Two Parent Baby Monitor. It's $200 but you do get what you pay for. No interference whatsoever coupled with perfect sound clarity. Ah bliss..."
2,The low point in Sanderling's cycle,"I avoid reviewing dead losses, but I've been going through Kurt Sanderling's Sibelius cycle from the Seventies disc by disc. It begins with an anomaly, an eye-opening Sym. #1 that promises great things to come. For the most part, nothing great happens. The third is quite enjoyable, but the conductor seems totally at sea in this installment. The entire cycle covers a number of years, form 1970 to 1977, and it seems that the later you go, the more listless the performances. I've never heard a more aimless Sibelius Fourth than the one here, from 1977, which is full of dispirited playing from the Berlin Sym., never better than an also-ran orchestra at their best.I hope for better from the 1971 account of Sym. #5, which after all is a repertory staple, but Sanderling sleep walks through it, too, so the entire program has no bright spots. In short, a CD to avoid."
5,Thanks For The Spiritual Guidance,"Bishop T.D. Jakes A beautiful man of God and all Due Honor to the Woman Of God whom stands at his side Sister Jakes.The two of you are worthy of Gods blessings for letting him work his ministries thru you two.I am just so overwhelmed by this Cd .The way it enrich the intimancy in my marriage,My Husband and I are very young and we gave God control of our lives,And to listen to this music it's everything we have experienced he ""Ushered"" me in the Prescence of God,He ""Lifted me up to God"",He's taught me to Love, Now we only dance for each other .May God Bless the two of you richly and continue on serving.The words of God says where there are (two) the two of you, That he would be a God in the Mist continue to let him use you as ""We"" desire too be used as well. Thank you"
5,Love the CD!,"This is a great gift for any couple or someone single, very good CD. I recommend purchasing this as a gift."
2,Shoulda stayed wit Three 6,"If you've heard Koopsta Knicca's first cd or any Three 6 Mafia cd you know dat Koopsta was one of da best in da group but dey had some kind of fallin out cuz Koopsta no longer wit dem. His new album ""Da K Project"" just cant live up to da material he made with Three 6 Mafia. The beats try so hard to be like DJ paul but dey wack an Koopsta switched up his style he tryna sing more. Take it from me pick up Da Devils Playground an any other Three 6 cd jus not dis one."
2,Fishing For A Fishers Review?,Leaving Fishers is an extremly deep book about a new girl named Dorry Stevens. Dorry meets a set of friends and thinks they are pretty cool. Dorry is eventually sucked up into a cult called Fishers of Men. I thought this book was HORRIBAL. I thought it was really to deep and dealt with alot of drama. This book hardly deserves two stars.
4,Prefuse 73 - Extinguished: Outtakes,"EXTINGUISHED: OUTTAKES is a hot mess, one that only Prefuse 73 could present. Even though these bits were axed from his ONE WORD EXTINGUISHER album, he's managed to cobble them into semi-coherency. ""Suite for the Ways Things Change"" represents the whole, I think, the way it switches tracks, but still seems to be of a whole. The tracks are segued such that it's impossible to tell where one begins and another ends -- a benefit when dealing with such disparate elements. ""Dubs That Don't Match"" strangely does match, and ""Between Man and Woman"" begs for something beyond its short running time, as does ""I Can't Get My Eyes Off."" ""3 Sounds from 94"" sounds more current than the title would have you believe, while ""Robot Snares Got No Cadence of Balance"" similarly proves its title wrong. Cheeky Scott Herren... he really knows how to construct."
3,Intake these outtakes,"A rare large disc of outtakes, from another single disc which helped this creative hip-hop beatsmith get recognized, that is surprisingly worthy, if not entirely necessary."
5,"Great session w. Joe Henderson, Ron Carter & Tony Williams","Sounds like your dream line-up? It must have been Mulgrew's back then. Tony Williams plays some of the most laid back, tasteful AND dynamic drums since his time with Miles - clearly he doesn't want to overpower Mulgrew on Mulgrew's own session - and Joe Henderson had just gotten the horn which he would play to the end - a Selmer Mk VI replacing the one that he had played on all the Blue Note classics, but which burned in a car accident and which he temporarily replaced with a Super Action 80 which he did not like at all. The point is that Joe's tone and playing on this album is rich and creamy, and with his trademark soul, innovation and melodic beauty all over the place.And that's not to mention Mulgrew and Ron.....in other words - a definite must have! Includes a VERY beautiful version of Bacharach's ""What The World Needs Now Is Love"" - what you need now is this album!"
4,Never listen to only ONE act - except...,"This recording from the Bayreuth Festival is stunning - and not least this first act. It is Wagner's ""Romeo & Juliette"". Nienstedt as Hunding is ominous, if not all that convincing, but King and Rysanek as the couple divided by conventions (they are twins) are terrific - really convincing! The last scene, where Siegmund (King) draws the sword from the tree-trunk is crowned by Sieglinde's cry of terror and delight - it's not in the score, and I've heard no other soprano do it, but it seems so RIGHT at this peak in the music! Buy it, if only for this moment!"
2,I could NOT believe it!,"I was all excited to receive my very BEST of Mungo Jerry! When it arrived, I played it thru and kept waiting for The Pushbike Song to play.....it wasn't there! I checked over the CD listing again and again....nope. I felt ripped....HOW can it be called the very best without his second biggest hit????....and yes, I know I should have checked before I ordered, but c'mon....some things in life should be a given and THIS is one. Speaking of life, mine will go on BUT I regret my purchase."
3,Smedium,"This shirt is for people who don't have a thrift store near them and want something to wear with their skinny jeans and neck tattoos so as to better communicate to the larger society that they are a unique soul and they aren't concerned with social norms.Overpriced for what you get (no glitter, about average attention from females, no black frame glasses with lenses removed).Recommend users go to Goodwill, where you can rub elbows with the other folks who like these kind of outfits and not look like a fool who paid too much for this shirt. Also they have 10 hangers for 1$ there sometimes so you can hang this T-shirt up (folding is so 1990s)."
4,Way Too Large,"Very nice material and design, but the shirt is very wide and very long. It can serve as a dress or nightshirt, so I'll be using mine as a nightshirt."
4,So fluffy!,"As someone who already has nine cats of her own, I love the idea of having 7 more that I dont have to feed! I do wish that more short-haired cats were used in the picture--the grooming and lint rolling is a little time consuming."
5,Definitive work on SQL/400,This book is required reading for new hires in my shop and our veteran programmers keep copies close at hand for ready reference. This is the ultimate guide to SQL on the AS/400 -- from database and SQL fundamentals to in-depth coverage of SQL programming and a top-notch treatment of data modeling and design principles.
4,Romantic Tale of Things Natural,"It is a romantic tale of things natural presenting a beautiful shots of fore- playing creatures on the earth, in the sky and under water.Nice charming music and a professional visual deed indeed."
1,This sucks,This is the worst movie ever made. Dont get me wrong the concept is funny its just the movie as a whole sucks. Its not funny at all
3,Watch out for different versions of sticky film,"I ultimately returned the sticky film because it was incompatible with my camera. There are two iZone cameras: an older model that is long and slim, and a newer one that is rounder. BEWARE that each uses a different type of film that is not compatible with the other."
3,They're not really stickers...,"Basically the 'sticky film' is just like the regular film, with a peel off piece on the back, revealing the adhesive. The polaroid film backing doesn't come off, so the picture is still stiff, so it's suitable for sticking to a refrigerator or locker, but not for sticking onto a smooth surface or normal paper. Still, it's handier than carrying around ruber cement."
5,My favorite book,I have read this book at least 13 times it is the best book and well worth the read. I have never seen it anywhere and am so glad my mom had it and it is now mine. Available on kindle would be great.
1,Mozart - The Magic Flute/ Sir Colin Davis,"OOOPS! Amazon.com, the one-star is for your poor product information. This CD (wonderful as Sir Colin is!) turned out to be the incomplete opera! You need to publish that the $66. Sir Colin one includes the libretto and is ""complete""; ""incomplete"" includes all arias, but no libretto or recitatives; ""highlights"" include only the popular arias or greatest hits of that opera.Right now your website is confusing, with the multiple recordings of a given work.Thank you.Cynthia DeCuir"
1,not working,"even if you take 4,5,6,drop it seems it's not doing anything.i've tried cup of coffee and you see result right way."
5,Ty Beanies,"Got to love this little bear. I have a ""million"" of these little guys and what is one more? Always a charmer."
4,Newer and better.,"This is the seconed one for the ps2 and it is much better. There r so many places to go and things to buy. There is a sandrail, buggy, trophy truck, monster truck, golf cart, dirt bike, atv, airplane, and a helicopter which i do not get why they r in this game. It is fun to fly them but there is nothing to do with them on free ride. Each vechile has many different races, ways to customize it, and paint it. The races is extreamly hard because the cpu either cheats or u fall of off the bike really easy. The other vechiles tip over or dont turn good. This game is awsome on free ride or multiplayer because there is so many things to do, drive, and to go. The graphics r good but about the same as other atv games. It is a fun game on multiplayer but it is hard unless u use cheat codes."
2,You get what you pay for,"We picked this flashlight out for its price and we can honesty say, we got what we paid for. We ordered two of them and when they got here one didn't want to work at all and took some harsh shaking and strategic placing of the shake element to get it to illuminate. Later the same night, the button shifted on the second one and only worked when stabbed with something long, like a pen. We will say, we figured they wouldn't be the best flashlights, but we wanted to make sure the concept worked before shelling out more money for a better made one. Well.....the concept works.....these flashlights just don't. Now we have two testy backup flashlights that you have to get rough with for them to work."
3,Acceptable but cheap quality product,"This flashlight works, but the quality is rather poor. You get what you pay for: a $3 flashlight. The plastic is flimsy, and one of the four I purchased was missing a rubber bumper inside so the magnet would make more noise banging into the end of the tube. It's not particularly bright and the plastic lens isn't great. It also uses a Ni-MH battery instead of a capacitor, so it won't last as long (in terms of years). Buy this only if you need something cheap for emergencies or a dismantling project."
1,Takes a lot of effort for a little light,"You have to shake this thing like mad to get just a few minutes of dim light. I bought two, both of which have the same problem. I have a decent emergency kit and try not to cheap out on the things that might keep my family safe but figured I couldn't go wrong with a flashlight. I should have spent a few extra bucks in the first place.Note: Mine didn't match the picture, it was camouflage. I don't care how something like this looks, the color would have been fine if it worked well."
5,Richter + Rostropovich = Perfection,Simply put: The best set of Beethoven's Violoncello Sonatas you'll be able to find. Period.
5,Something in Common,I am a HUGE Bobby Brown fan....this CD is great! That had most of the songs ...that I wanted on one CD...This CD does not disappoint. I would love for Bobby to make a comeback. I'll have frong row seats.
5,Good for getting into tight places,This is a great hacksaw for getting into tight places. The ergo design is good and the polymer frame makes it lightweight.
5,Fantastical,"This novel is the most weird and fantastical novel I have ever read. This, of course, means it is one of the best. The plot is surreal, the words are deep and rich, and it is so original, so beautiful and so brave, that any reader if affected by it.When reading, you are plunged into such a different world that the images created encase you, lock you into the plot.This novel, is a step into the mist for anyone who has only stuck to the odd thriller. It is a opening to wider horizons - that of magic realism."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!,"Between Russo and the New Blood this is nothing but a soap opera! The announcers no longer bother with the action in the ring. They are too busy following the script written for them.WCW charges far too much for their videos, sometimes twice as much as WWF. They seem to have gotten rid of the real stars and kept all of the morons. A few stars do still flicker here and there.They are even editing all of the swear words out now. Even mild words are blipped out!I thought the nWo was silly but they have topped themselves big time! Save your money and rent this one first..."
4,"Nice, But Not the Same as the Picture",It seams very good quality so far and is nice and big. But the label holder on the side isn't there.
5,It keeps getting betta,"She always keep me affected. Her energy portrayed in this project is illuminating and I dig it. You know only listen, tap, but think."
1,false advertising,tape works better. it came off the first time we used it-on shabbos. way too expensive for what it is-a piece of cheap plastic.
3,one little problem,"There is a spout on one side only, and it's the wrong side IMO. Why? Because I am able to use only my right hand for pouring, and as a right-hander, I tend to pour w/ my left hand while holding a spatula for scraping with my right. Maybe I'm unusual, and other right-handed people use their right hand for pouring, but for me it's awkward. Other than that, this is a nice little pan and very useful. Farberware could have made this with pouring spouts on both sides, like the straining 1-quart saucepan has."
5,Great Year-round,"This little pan was a lifesaver during my holiday baking frenzy, but I find myslef using it well after the holiday season as well. It is the perfect size for melting a cube of butter, and it is very easy to brown the butter without burning it. The spout feature is really handy for not making a mess when pouring out the melted butter. This is a very handy little gadget that I wish I had purchased some time ago."
2,Good but ..,"This is just OK with lots of omissions, no "" Golden Mean"" measurement? Kind of simplified at the end. For Nova I expected more. Misinformation. Would not recommend."
4,God... Sarah Blackwood is BACK!!,"Just like reviewer: ""orbitalgun76"" (Bemidji, Minnesota United States) said on September 17, 2003...""Sexy! I was and still am an obsessed fan of Dubstar and that bands singer Sarah Blackwood. So when I found out that Sarah had a new project on the table I immediately preordered this cd. And just as I thought, it was another gem. Sarah has one of my favorite voices in music and the dirty, sexy, electro beats of Client work well with it.""And with that thought, many of the previous reviewers would do well to know that Sarah Blackwood (in Client, and previously in Dubstar) have been producing this ""electro"" sound for longer than a decade; much longer than your Ladytron and the like. Please, give this wonderful group a chance... and if you like it, than please go and dig back a few years for Sarahs previous group, Dubstar, and their albums ""Disgraceful"", ""Goodbye"", and their final album ""Make It Better"".Just my 2 cents :)"
3,"Too large for 12"" tramontina ware","Greetings,This skillet lid is too large for a 12"" skillet. Measures from inside to inside 11 3/4. Can be used but, not satisfactory.Farbarware should be notified."
4,"Works great, but lid knob need occasionally tightened","Product works as advertised. The knob/handle on top occasionally needs tightened, but it is not a hassle at all. Would recomend to others."
4,Farberware Cookware Glass lid,The first one fractured in the dishwasher on the first wash. This one gets hand washed. Never had trouble with the smaller lids. Works fine on the stove top. For domestic peace hand wash only in this house.
2,one cold bland nutcracker,"Fast tempos at times, bland interpretation,no emotion or magic for that matter this is what you need in this work of Tchaikovsky and you dont get it here from dorati,the amsterdam players play well still dorati ruins it.Get his sleeping beauty with this same orchestra its better, but if you want a great performence of the nutcracker get ernest ansermets 1959 (decca),charles dutiots complete version with the montreal symphony (decca),or eugene ormandys 1960 (columbia) version there a lot better."
2,Knot the best book,It would be better if there was more literature for each knot. I wasn't going to comment till I tried to tie the Poldo tackle knot on page 155. All I've got to say is it is impossible to tie the knot according to the book.
5,Very soothing!!,"I was looking for some bedtime/sleep music, and this is perfect! Very mellow, slow and soothing! Just wonderful! You have to hear it for yourself, though. There are just two tracks, both around an hour or so, which works very well for sleeping. Maybe not something you want to listen to during the day, unless you want to take a break from stress and relax, or even meditate, I suppose!"
2,Not what I was inspecting,"The book was good, and I usually love books that twist fairy tales into something new, but this time is might have been twisted a little to much. While the classic story was still there, it lost some of the charm that always comes with the original"
3,"Ok, i give this a 3 and a half","This book was pretty good. It had a lot of detail on ""Beast's"" life (hence, the title), but I was disappointed to see that ""Beauty"" did not enter the scene until the last chapters. I expected more interaction between the two of them, and was looking more for the original fairy tale of Beauty and the Beast. Other than that, this book is filled with great imagery and detail, and I especially liked the beginning when the prince is still in Persia. It was interesting to learn a bit about their land and culture. This is a book that I might read again in a year, but it is not good enough to read over and over again like several other of Donna Jo Napoli's books. I do recommend reading this book though, it IS worth your time."
4,Bash at the Beach 2000,"The pay-per-view was okay it was from Daytona Beach Flordia. It had matches such as Chavo V Juventud, Daffney v Miss Handcock, Kanyon V Booker T, Scott Steiner v Mike Awesome, Goldberg V Nash, Jeff Jarrett v Hogan, Jarret v Booker T it was a very good pay-per-view."
2,Screwjob 2000,"Hulk Hogan got screwed out of the title then gets kicked out of WCW by that little Italian creep. Goldberg and Nash was a good match. At least, Booker T won the title instead of that blonde headed fool Jeff Jarrett. Waitaminute, this is the Spanish version I am an American. Why does America have to keep on supporting illegal immigrants. Read this: uno, dos, tres cuatro #!$% you cinco, and the rest of your stupid language."
3,Lower the price.(not really a kid),"I really want to this video. Heck, Im willing to pay 50 for it. But 500? Thats just insane. No one will pay for that. I know this is a good show and a controversial one at that. But it is not worth half a grand. When I say Id pay 50 for it, that is even pushing it. So please, lower the price."
2,most important part broke on 3rd use,"The third time i used the cookie press, the double threaded ring that connects the tube to the handle not only cracked but disintegrated. way beyond gluing. if i want to replace it i will have to buy another whole set -- with no assurance that the ring will not do the same again.i would like to buy a dozen replacement rings. even if it as much as a new cookie press, or more, i don't know what i'd do with a dozen cookie presses."
3,i am a little disappointed,good but very short think they are like 3 inches long so i'm letting you know so you don't wast your money
1,Exceptionally poor album.,"Terrible lyrics, terrible rhyme skills. Music bad on the scale of one of Kool Keith's throwaway records. Marc Live should just stick to being a hype man."
4,"reference, great not superb","great reference book, should be something like it for every field. more information on projected or common use of hardware and tools would make the book superb. As is, it is great."
2,Less than stellar,"This book was not at all what I expected when I ordered it. I expected more of a textbook type text with explanations and examples of how things are done. Instead the book is nothing but conversion and information tables and charts and sketches of different tools that are used backstage. This would be nice if there were some explanation of the different uses of each of these tools, however there is nothing but a picture and the name of the item."
2,Disapointing,This book has too little to say about theatre and too much in the way of tables which are available elsewhere.
2,Disappointed...,"I had the teakettle was over a year now. The inside of the kettle is discolored and appears to have rust spots. I have other stainless steel pots, and none of them became discolor or develope rust spots like this one. I don't want to drink rusty tea. I stop using it."
5,Nice Little Teakettle,"I was a little worried after reading all the mixed reviews. Now that I have used it 2x a day for the past month, I think this kettle is well worth the 7 dollars I paid. A lot of reviewers say that the whistle part doesn't work. I noticed the same thing when I put the kettle on a lower power burner and the water would boil but no whistle. However, the whistle has never failed when I put it on the larger burners with higher heat. Yes, the handle part gets a little hot, but I am okay with it."
1,1- year replacement plan,1-Year Replacement Plan for Electronics Products $125 to $149.99This would be a good plan if New Customer Service would of sent me my Plan. But New Customer Service did give me a full refun. I will try New Customer Service again.
2,Have not recieved,"I recieved a bill but have not recieved a confirmation or paper work. The order is is shown to have been sent out over 20 days ago. I contacted the company through amazon, which was relatively easy. Now I am waiting on a reply."
3,It is okay,Wish it was for a longer period of time. If something is going to go wrong the manufactor's warrenty will cover it.
4,Replacement plan,"We have not had to use the plan at this point, but it was sent immediately and actually arrived prior to the electronic item."
4,great gate,this gate is great for the price.. and it's quick and easyi wish i had found this one before purchasing the more permanent ones..this one i can put it on the front door quickly and take it away without spend forever setting it up.the handle is a little tough but is getting easier the more i use it
3,Safety 1st,This gate is sturdy. My five year old would climb over it and it dosent fall. But the reason he climbs is because its hard for me to keep taking the latch in and out. Extremely hard. Other than that it keeps my 13 month old out of the kitchen. So thats reassuring.
4,Problems at the Alpine Bank,"Something's going on at the Alpine Bank and nobody seems to know what it is. Newspaper editor Emma Lord suspects that there will be a merger or a buyout, either scenario guaranteed to upset the residents of Alpine, a small Washington town nestled in the foothills of the Cascade Mountains. Emma and her friend Vida begin to do some investigating, and suddenly things are complicated by the death of a prominent bank employee. There are several red herrings when, as usual, suspicion is first directed at newcomers and outsiders. Emma succeeds in aggravating the town sheriff, Milo, with her meddling, but eventually the murderer is brought to justice. If you enjoy this book, start at the beginning and work your way through the Alpine series."
2,Can't take much,"I bought this from a local hardware store. It worked for a few uses, but the plastic socket on the screwdriver that holds the bits cracked open when I was unscrewing something. Now, it doesn't work at all because nothing's there to hold the bit in. What a waste. Get something that's a little tougher.Seriously, a metal socket would be what, another 5 to 10 cents?"
4,A good place to get started with the Beach Boys,"When you consider this DVD for what it is--a broad overview of a band that's been kicking around for (at the time) nearly four decades (now almost 5), it's a good place to get acquainted with this band. I realize there is only so much you can cram into two hours, but I personally could have heard more about Dennis Wilson's artistic contributions to the band when Brian stepped back (and only now, 25 years after his death, is DW finally getting the hearing and reinstatement back to the BB canon) and I definitely could have heard less about Mike Love's exaggerated contributions to the band. But to his credit, Alan Boyd takes an overall balanced look at the history of a band that's had more faces and personalities than any surviving bands of the 60s; there are also some really great clips in here.But if you are going to watch this for the first time, be sure to get your hands on Jon Stebbins' Dennis WIlson: The Real Beach Boy, available June 2008."
2,dvd beach boys overrated,"Only a few of the audio tracks are in 5.1 dolby surround and those are not even their popular songs. The rest of the ""songs"" varies from ordinary stereo to poor mono. This is not a dvd for the lover of beach boys songs as we listened to their everlasting great sounds on their cd's. ""Songs"" on this dvd are continuously interupted by ""bragging"" stereotype anthology remarks by the beach boys themselves or other musicians.The ""songs"" are grouped in a few chapters - and once you have selected a specific chapter you've got to sweat it through until the end of that chapter OR fast forward to the next song/talks.This dvd should get some merits from enthusiastic anthology followers of the beach boys. DEFINATELY NOT for the sit back, relax and enjoy music listener.a WASTE for those with a proper theatre hifi system - rather turn on a cd of THE BEACH BOYS."
4,3.5 stars,"I ordered this saw from Amazon. It arrived in about a week. Everything was packed securely and there was no damage or dings or scratches on the bandsaw. Assembly was very simple and straight forward. Machine runs pretty well except for mild vibration even after adjustment/tune-up. I replaced the belt witha PowerTwist belt with mild improvement. The mobile base is excellent and very sturdy. Overall, I am happy with the saw, except for the following:1. The dust collection assembly is a piece of plastic that is held in place with a small clip. Very cheaply made dust collection system and does not work well.2. The rip fence which is made out of aluminum is not flat vertically and I can not get it to sit 90 degrees with the table. I am planning to contact Delta to get a new fence.3. The bandsaw wheels were out of plane when arrived from the factory, but this can be adjusted.I hope this review was helpful."
5,"Another recording by Beaux Arts Trio, 1987","There is also a Philips release, item 422 079-2. It seems this was re-recorded with the Beaux Arts Trio recorded at La Chaux-de-Fonds, Switzerland, 5/1987. The personel are different for this recording:M Pressler, pianoIsadore Cohen, ViolinB. Greenhouse Violincelle"
4,took a little longer to receive,Ordered two weeks ago. have not installed yet so net sure how this one will work but i am replacing an identicle one i purchased last year that already went bad...I hope this one lasts longer...
2,Not Weatherproof,This item lists as being a pool timer. Unless your pool is indoors shy away from this. The metal box that the timer is in is NOT weatherproof making it inappropriate for outdoor installation.Luckily my existing pool timer and this one's clock mechanism were the same so I just swapped them out BUT had I really wanted to do that I would have just bought the clock mechanism. I wanted a new box but it wasn't worth the hassle of exchanging the item.
2,Not what I was expecting,"I picked this up for a few bucks thinking it was going to be metal or hardcore going by the name of the band. It wasn't. It's more of an alt-rock/pop style.It's definitely creative and the lyricist is talented, but it didn't keep me listening to it over again. The standout song for me is The Longest Day in Mrs Evers' Life. They go into a rap in the middle of this song and I like the chord progression.This CD is creative and unique but not enough so to hold my attention."
5,I never knew.,"For some reason I missed many of Maugham's short stories. If truth be told, I actually liked a lot of these short stories more than some of my favorites of his novels. He's forced to ferret out all the extra peripheral writing in a short story which seems to make it clean and precise without losing his awesome eye for thepoit. Loved it."
4,Workmanlike,"This latest Halford release is good, but had nothing which really blew me away. You can even skip it if you want. The lyrics actually tackle heavy subject matter this time around, like religion, drug abuse, and 9/11 as opposed to the fantasy/rebel themes on most Priest releases. Musicly, it's still the same Painkiller style he's been doing since 1990 on every release except for Two. Get it or not, it doesn't really matter. It's fine if you get it, and if you don't you're not missing anything. Overall a let-down after Resurrection and Live Insurrection. The lyrical themes might keep me going back."
3,Resurrection is better,"This album excited my curiosity after buying Resurrection,but I wasn't very excited when I listened to it.The only tracks worth listening to are all at the end:Sun, She, and Fugitive.These last tracks are so much more like those on Resurrection;and Halford's voice is so much better on these,that I'm wondering if they were perhaps recorded at the time that Resurrection was recorded,and not put[or wouldn't fit]on it.It's like listening to another album.War of Words [Fight]is probably better than this album if you want more of Halford.Don't touch the albums from his band ""TWO"" either.This is only my opinion.You pays yer money and you takes yer choice.Go for Resurrection."
1,What is this??,"I will have to agree with Stygiansteel's review on the Crucible disc. Song writing is very inconsistent and do not stick in your head. Recording is very bad, mix is thrown together and the vocals are also horribly produced. Album sounds rushed instead of inspired.I also think Roy Z should take a backseat on producing albums. His productions tend to be overly sludgy sounding with overdone bass and drum volume drowning out the overall mix. I have a couple of Helloween discs produced by Roy Z and the production is also muddied on them as well.Rob Halford should stick to the original formula instead of experimenting. If it ain't broke don't fix it..."
4,Wrong Color But Right Product,The photo showed a black adapter which would look better on my motorcycle since I already had a white one. It does the job though just wish it was color in ad.
2,"A dark, frustrating read from an author I love","Although A.S. Byatt is my favorite modern author, I must agree with the reader who says this seems like a draft for one of her later novels. I found it very frustrating that I could never connect with either of the two sisters in the novel, nor understand what game they were playing--either literally or figuratively--with each other. The description of the childhood game of imagination Byatt gives is not at all compelling; it's very difficult to believe that this game could have controlled the sisters' lives. In addition, the story is unremittingly dark and hopeless. Although Byatt often explores dark themes, there are usually also ""bright spots,"" of love, joy, or at least everyday happiness to counterbalance them. I was happy to finish this book but, since it is the ONLY Byatt work I have disliked, I continue to look forward to what comes next!"
1,Weak Training,"This video was somewhat informative but they never did show you the actual maintenance or repairs being done. They talk about alot of maintenance and setup information but never come through with a visual of what they are explaining. If all your looking for is general guitar care and repair information and not ""How To"" instructions, then this is the DVD for you. I hate to say but I will be tossing this video. I did get a good one that John Carruthers (Carruthers Gutars) is on and he shows you what he is talking about and how to do most everything he is addressing on the video. See the reviews on ""Alfred's Teach Yourself Guitar Repair and Maintenance""."
2,not very helpful,"This poorly produced ""home video"" may be helpful for those who really only need the introductory information. However, when advanced topics arise, the two hosts simply tell the viewer to ""consult with your local luthier..."" I purchased this video to avoid paying my local luthier! Lastly, many of the camera angles are so poor that you literally cannot see some of the repairs. Oh well, at least it was under ten bucks!"
3,Its cool..........,"But do not think that you are buying anything close to QR. For a first time solo album, Geoff Tate did real well. This cd will help most relax from a long day."
2,Dead on arrival,"The unit was DOA (The power cord it came with, and several sockets i plugged it in to, all checked out OK). So, i can't rate the unit's performance."
1,I guess mine is cursed,After reading the other reviews I have come to the conclusion that my boombox must be cursed. I've had it less than a year and it has started not recognizing my CDs. I put the CD in and it makes some grinding noises and then says 'no disc'. If I open and close it several times it will usually recognize it eventually. I wish I had purchased it from Amazon so I could return it. I love the sound quality.
3,its alright,"im a die-hard CB fan and i gotta admit, it kinda jumped the shark with the movie. it wasnt bad, in fact its better than most movies that ive seen recently, but the characters seem distant and at times, a little unfamiliar. my review is more for the movie than the DVD because i saw it in Japanese with English subs, but from what ive heard, aside from the standard perks you get with watching DVDs, the english dubbing for the movie is excellent with voices from the original series (except for Spike, who gets help from a different voice actor who sounds like the one were familiar with). i dont want to give to much away so ill just say the plot was kind of generic, as was the bad guy. anyway, if youre a fan, this is a must see, but if youve never seen an episode, pick up a couple sessions first."
3,Quality animation,"This anime has everything for a good action movie. The quality of the animation is high and consistent. The plot holds together and keeps a good pace, right to the end. All the elements of sci-fi, terrorist-on-the-loose, and hard-boiled detective come together well. The result is a well-crafted piece of entertainment.There are lots of well-made anime, however, and this never pulls ahead of the pack. It has a standard look, with long-legged characters and a fairly clean city of the future. The plot elements are used well, but are nothing new. Some of the characters, like Edward, are delightfully quirky, but come across as the requisite side-kick.The world of anime includes Akira and Miyazaki's work. A movie has to have something exceptional to earn five stars by those standards. I enjoyed this one, as I enjoy lots of other well made flicks. It just never distinguished itself from the rest."
3,Wonder what happen with all the dvd edition extras,"I just bought this blu ray and i was astonished to find out that it has only stereo audio and no extras (yes, i got it cheap, but nonetheless). Why not put the dvd special edition extras?Cowboy Bebop: The Movie [Special Edition] or the 5.1 english/japanese audio track? i'm still wondering what happened with this edition. Now i have to keep them both to get all the material."
4,Pleasantly surprised,"I was very apprehensive about buying this movie. I loved the Anime series, and have all the episodes on DVD, but never saw the movie.It was good. Entertaining, and the characters keep true to themselves.If you are a Bebop fan, then buy it, it is worth it."
3,Style and Some Fun,"I love Cowboy Bebop - all 26 episodes. I was introduced to it by this movie here back when I was a teenager. When I watched the movie again, however, it felt like a challenge. The animation is in top form, and the Blu-Ray really accents the colors, both neon and elemental. But the story just dragged far too long for what it was worth, and you end up feeling a lot like Spike there - wandering around all those alleys and stairways and crawling through a secret door just to find.... disappointment.The art is beautiful, but the focus on it is just too much. When there is action, it is impressive and often exciting. When there is exposition, however, it crawls to the point of extreme boredom.Even still, it is a good entry point and definitely worth having if you're already a fan. For those not yet initiated: it gets a whole lot better in the anime, and the humor is greater, the background livelier, and the characters are all the more interesting."
1,Uh. I don't get it.,"I never liked Cowboy Bebop and I tried to watch all the episodes when I borrowed the box set from my friend. I wanted to see why people liked the series so much, but I honestly couldn't watch it because it was so boring. I thought maybe the movie would be better, but it's just as boring as the series. I really don't understand how everyone can like this so much. The movie isn't funny, I only laughed like twice, there is nothing good or interesting about the characters, plus I really don't like the way the way the movie looks. It's kind of dull and depressing. Am I the only one in the world that doesn't like Cowboy Bebop?"
5,this will make you love anime,I order this movie off of Columbia House.com sorry Amazon but they have better deals. Anyway when I first watch this movie I though It was kind of boring as far as the story goes but I gave it a chance and watch it over and over again then I've grown to love it. The highlight of this movie is Spike and Vencent fight at the end. The background is awsome no japanese but american songs. The movie trailers I wish were just all anime's and the Steamboy trailer was just too short but it has a better trailer when you buy the Resident Evil Apocalypse dvd. The animation is drawn good.
2,"Great Movie, the DVD could be better","The Movie was great. The dvd on the other hand could be better. Instead of offering French as a language option, Sony should have made the Japanese language 5.1 digital. Also, the English subtitles are extremely terrible. The extras were great. The English dubbing was very good and did the charaters justice."
1,I'm sorry but he can't sing,Regis is a great talk show host but a terrible singer. It doesn't even sound like he's singing. He's just talking over music. It's bad.
1,I thought he was going to sing,We bought this album as my mother is a huge fan of Regis and we always buy two Christmas albums a year. What a disappointment. Regis doesn't so much sing as talk along to the background music. His wife's voice on Baby its cold outside is great - compared to him. This will be one of those CDs that go in a drawer and never see the light of day again.
2,Good Book with Lousy Kindle Formatting,"This book was pretty useful as a nuts 'n' bolts manual for the beginning or seasoned writer. On this level I would give it 4 out of 5 stars. It doesn't get 5 stars because no new insights or methodologies were introduced.However, I've given this book only two stars because all they (Amazon or the publisher) did was to scan the existing text into ebook format. They (whoever did this) still use pages to refer to other sections in the text and not Amazon's Locations. Next, the index is still there but it refers to pages and not to Locations...which makes it useless. Finally, the index has not been activated so it will not take you to the Location listed.Whomever was responsible for preparing this book as a Kindle screwed the pooch big time.Still a pretty good book but not much good for research because of Amazon's faulty prepping of the book for their e-reader.A very disappointed customer here."
4,Best on the Market so far,"Broke the one I had, so I have to have another. I'll buy 2 or 3 this time. How else can you open a bottle of champagne, reseal it and be able to lay it on it's side in the fridge or freezer. Open this baby like you would remove the cork, because the pressure is still there...(Mark Sutherlin)"
3,A champagne stopper that works,"This is one of the few champagne stoppers that work effectively, but is not the easiest to operate. It takes quite a few turns of the top knob to open or close, however it does seal the bottle very well."
5,The BEST!,keeps wine and champagne so fresh! works really well. Doesn't pop off like other champagne stops. I give them as gifts all the time.
5,Great price for this book,"This book prepares you for all types of law enforcement exams, not just for the police. Any type of lost prevention would benefit from using this as one of the many manuals available and the price is fantastic. Fast and great wrapped shipping."
5,Awesome service!!,I was amazed by the awesome service I received for this product. It was shipped in less than a week; I would recommend this buyer to anyone who needs anything! This book was a huge help for the written exam I took for a department. It can improve anybody's reading and writing abilites.
4,Good quality phone,"Compact and clear sounded cordless phone. The only down side I saw is the blinking of the new messages is very fair in bright room, you sometimes miss to check messages until later. Overall, recommended."
4,Great Buy,I am very happy with my purchase. I have found Panasonic to be the best brand in cordless phones. It's easy to hear the person on the other end which has not been true with other brands I've had. My favorite features with this phone are the talking CID and the different musical ring tones. I don't have to pick up the phone and look to see who's calling. My only minor complaint is that it doesn't have memory speed dial feature. Nothing that I can't live without but it would've made it 5 stars for me if it had this feature. Otherwise this is a great buy and I'm very happy with it.
2,Not much here,"Got the bat for practice and to use in batting cages. Good for cages, but little to no pop. This bat just has no pop at all. Good for batting cages but thats about all, I would not use this one in a game if I had other options."
3,"Great content for true Todd fans, but poor quality DVD","If you're truly a Todd fan, you've probably seen this already in the VHS format. I've enjoyed it many times in that format and was excited to see it available on DVD...but was very disappointed when I finally viewed the DVD, as it looks like it's a second or third generation dub from the VHS copy. At least on the DVD I bought, the picture quality is so lousy I suggest you stay with the VHS.So, 4 and a half stars for the material. One star for the visual quality."
2,A poor effort,"I am a long time Todd fan going back to Nazz days. I saw him every time I could. He did a show at the Fox Theatre in Atlanta with Utopia that still blows me away to think about. I have almost all of his recorded music.Having said that, this DVD is not recommended. The interview part is interesting, but Todd often comes cross as self indulgent and arrogant. This is in stark contrast to the image that I have developed of the man who is often self effacing in his lyrics. The other parts of this DVD are simply poor except for the three song video which is well worth watching. Except for that part, don't buy this DVD for the music.To say that I was disappointed in a number of ways would be an understatement. Most importantly, this video has changed my view of Todd which is very disturbing. Yeah we're all human but to see a god reduced to the level of dour human being is extremely painful."
1,If you like Todd's music DON'T WATCH THIS!,"As a ""long time Todd fan"", I realize I need to re-define that to read ""long time TODD'S MUSIC"" fan, as I suppose I don't even really know Todd. If I were Todd and had any say so I would pull this waste of time and money from the shelves before anyone else has a chance to view it. I found it to be pseudo intellectual/philosophical to the point of nausea with cheezy dream/fantasy sequences set to music between interviews (which you can read about in the other reviews). Somehow I failed to read the fine print and thought I was getting live Todd performances with some interviews. (OOPS!)I can't believe the person who wrote so much great music is the personality protrayed on the DVD. Chalk it up to the 80's (or whenever this was produced) Sorry, Todd."
5,Can't wait for the next one!,"SOOOOO good, I can't wait until October. If Lippman could put out a book weekly, I still wouldn't be able to wait for the next installment of Tess Monaghan's adventures! As a Marylander and former Baltimorean, every book feels like home."
1,Quite working after 4 days,After trying for about an hour I had the photo control working. It worked for 4 days then stopped turning the light on after dark. I've tried and tried to reset the control but nothing has worked. So i'm looking at using something else for the light control. But not another Intermatic.
2,Finally recieved payment,"I had the $99 replacement plan. When my DVD player broke, I called the company as instructed and waited for an RMA that was supposed to be emailed to me. It didn't show up. I called about twice a week for 2-3 months, gave them 3 different email addresses and my home mailing address without receiving anything. Finally, someone at their company just mailed me the replacement check and it arrived in the mail. I would have rated this one star but I did get the money afterall. They probably make their money on people giving up and not demanding their refunds..."
4,Very Good,"I found this book to be very thorough and descriptive. It goes into elaborate detail about each event discussed. It was not particularly easy to read; the author depends on your memory quite a bit because all of the stories are linked to each other. I found that the book was written more to inform than entertain, but considering that's what i was looking for, i enjoyed it."
2,Spend some extra cash and get some better glass,"When my EOS 10D arrived I was without the lens I really wanted (Canon's 28-135 IS) so my local Wolf store let me 'borrow' this as a holdover. I [took] about 400 pictures at a local horse show and was astounded at how soft the pictures came out. So bad were the images that I thought my 10D had the fabled 'focus' issue. I quickly returned the lens and advanced my purchase of a prime (the Canon EF 50mm macro 2.5). Wow - like having a different camera. The 28-90 has a fast, quiet autofocus, but after that the only good thing is it's price. If you're interested in sharp pictures at all, spend some extra money - you'll be happier in the long run."
4,Works Well,It is great having a color LaserJet printer. I am using it on my Mac. The only thing I wish this printer had was a built in wireless capability. I have it plugged into my Time Capsule and not into my computer but it would be better if it were wireless like my Photosmart printers by HP. Installation went without a hitch and I am very happy with my new color printer.
3,Nothing like Living after Death,"In a few words, the concert wasn't that bad, however the audio was terrible. I had a hard time trying to listen Bruce Dickinson voice. I agreed with most reviewers, if you are looking to a concert close to Living after death, you are looking in the wrong place.However if you are big Iron Maiden fan. This is a DVD you probably would like for your collection."
2,Lack of Enthusiasm,"First off, the sound quality is horrible. It sounded like a poor bootleg copy. Second, Bruce put no energy into his singing. You can tell he is burnt out and is glad to leave the band. But the rest of the band played amazing as always. And don't even get me started on the magic show..... those had to be the lamest tricks I have ever seen. The Ronald McDonald magic show was more believable."
1,DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY,"I love MAIDEN and especially now that Bruce is back...The audio just plain SUCKS...You cant hear Bruce .....even though its only 12 bucks ,you'll be wasting your time and be VERY Disapointed !!"
2,An excellent piece of entertainment,"The last Iron Maiden performance to be fronted by the God of heavy metal vocalists, Bruce Dickinson (until he returned!). The set alternates between fantastic live performances by the band and entertaining 'evil' tricks by magician Simon Drake, with appropriate interaction between the two... absolutely perfect for anyone just getting into Iron Maiden, a mood-lifter for fans anyway."
4,Great performance but poor sound quallity!,"It was a great idea..let Iron Maiden do their show and let Simon Drake take care of the rest! The result is indeed a great performance by Iron Maiden and the illusions of Simon Drake are also good, good with a little humor but not great. The only bad thing on this DVD is the sound quallity! It will take ten songs to get a good sound! By the start of The Number Of The Beast the sound is finally dolby 5.1 But before that it's sad. I had to put the center speaker wide open to hear Bruce sing! The show itself is what we can ecspect from Iron Maiden.Good solide and again with a lot of humor by Bruce and Nico.The setlist is great! They even play Transylvania! And because this was supposed to be Bruce's last performance with the band ( at this time he has already returned ), this DVD is worth to buy!"
5,A must have for any landscape artist,This is a fabulous book...it's not essentially a how to guide but rather insightful presentation of things you should be aware of when preparing for any landscape...actually quite a lot of the information in the book can be applied to most any artwork regardless of the medium...I found the writing be very comprehensive; although at times I to remind my self that the book was written in the early part of the 20th century and that consequently the author/artists attitude conformed to ideals of the day. Since day one this book has become my Bible.
5,Definitive,"You will learn more rereading this book than you will reading most others the first time through.This book offers specific, well-explained examples of how and why landscape features appear, and how to render them on a canvas. Example, branches on the near side of a tree show their dark underside, while those on the far side of a tree show their light tops. Light will appear to wrap around a smaller tree's trunk, only larger trees will be truly dark.Many books on painting offer vague generalizations and discussions, this book offers explicit instruction on every page. That said, Carlson does not offer you the ""cheats"" that so many books do, how to appear to render a complex subject in a few brushstrokes. This book is more for those who want to paint what they see, and as Carlson also explains, how to choose what to paint from what is seen.Remember, a painter can capture anything he sees; a photographer can only capture what everyone sees."
1,Use a Different Book!,"I am halfway through this book and felt compelled to write a review.I bought this book because I found the All in One A+ book by Meyers to be of great value. However I am very disapointed in this book. Without even commenting on the content, there are so many typos and other mistakes that I have lost confidence in it. I get the distinct impression that this book was thrown together as quickly as possible. Any other study book would almost have to be better than this one."
4,Small Price for a lot of Sound,"I was looking for a boombox that would play MP3 formatted CDs as well as regular CDs and have an auxillery input jack for my MP3 player. This RCA boombox has all of these features and it offers great sound. It has predefined playing modes (rock, jazz, classical, pop)and a bass boost feature which adds some depth to the music that plays. Sure you can find something a lot louder that costs a lot more. But for the money this little boombox can hold it's own. I also like that it is light weight, easy to carry around with you, and has a user friendly interface. The only feature that I would like to have had is a remote. But again for the price you can't go wrong."
3,"sand, silt and snow","The authors pack a lot into this one volume and the maps accompanying each trail description are detailed enough to hike from; the elevation loss and gain charts are useful when planning your trip, especially to those who like to hike, but not uphill. Covering Death Valley National Park, Mojave National Preserve, Joshua Tree National Park, and Anza Borrego Desert State Park the 111 trips vary from a short stroll to the demanding all-day Telescope Peak trip. The black and white photographs don't really add anything to the book but the trail descriptions are good."
3,An odd selection of material,"I've been following Malone for a few years, have the studio discs (including the stellar Benny Green duo albums), and seen him live twice. He's indescribably talented, but also is cursed by a tone and ""sweetness"" that some outsiders might judge as old-fashioned in an ""elevator music"" style. In his studio discs he makes up for this with brilliance in all styles, from ballads to dynamic funk. The live at Jazz Standard disc collects what seems to be his middle-of-the-road songs that don't show off alot of dynamism or chops (except the last track, which seems included only because of the novelty of him playing ""dirty blues""). The songs are great, the playing is very tasteful, but I rarely try to turn on my non-jazz friends to a disc because it's ""hella tasteful"". Get ""Bluebird"" or ""Sweet Georgia Peach"" if you want amazing Malone."
2,There is a far superior resource...,"There is a far superior resource than this publication available. The breadth of brands covered in Watches International 2000 and the depth of coverage are questionable at best. While most of the information is organized well and presented in a seemingly objective fashion, at times, the focus of this book seemed to be on marketing rather than on the watches themselves. For instance, the section on Bedat appeared to come straight out of a Bedat advertisement. Sections like this beg the question, ""Did certain makers contribute generously to the financing of this publication?"" Furthermore, some of the makers that have been included seem to have been selected based on their watches' high ticket prices rather than on the maker's ability to make a superior timepiece. If objective information on fine timepieces is what you are looking for, spend your money on Wristwatch Annual 2000 by Peter Braun instead."
2,No input jacks...HELLO !!!,Boy was I dissapointed to find or not to find any input jacks. It's called an MP3 player Sony !!! I promptly returned it...
5,A Big Hit,"I bought this for my mom's birthday and she loves it. She can be pretty picky so we all have a certain amount of fear when it comes to selecting gifts for her. Every time I talk to her now, she tells me how much she is enjoying it and that the sound is incredible. I haven't listened to it personally yet, but if she likes it, others will too."
3,BARELY ANY CHEMISTRY!,"Best friends check out a Carribean resort with their respective ""lovers"". The partners fall for each other, are caught in bed together, and the best friends decide to make it look like they are together. There didn't seem to be enough chemistry between the friends to make for a good story but the love scenes were pretty hot and sometimes risque."
2,This is JUNK - waste of money,"This think is really junky- It probably cost $1.25 at most to make in some 3rd world country. Zipper broke, the handle came off, etc. Save your money. Invest in a better class and just buy 2 or 3 or whatever it takes to house this amount."
3,"The beginning... interesting, funny, but cheezy","The quality of the tape and of the recording is really great, and there are no commercials before or after the episodes, which is fine. The first episode could have been better since it was the beginning of the series and the exposition and dialogues were often badly handled. ""Mind War"" is much better, and I highly recommend it."
3,Newer is not better,"I've always found this topic irrestible; what could be better than NASA, Patrick Stewart, and Tomita all together? And on DVD with 5.1 surround, overwhelming, I thought. I was first introduced to this mixture via the VHS version in 92 or 93 and thought it was a peak experience. I am sorry to say that I am disappointed in this version, and am now looking for the older VHS tape, which I thought was much better. I found that most of the 5.1 sound coming out of the rear speakers was distracting, and the new, enhanced footage not in keeping with the original. Also, I wanted to hear Tomita, not a very loud Patrick Stewart, and the bass seemed to be lacking in the soundtrack. SO, back to VHS for me...."
5,The truth will set you free,I found this book to be very truthful and helpful in understanding the teaching of the JW's. Having some of my family involved in this cult I struggled to understand what they were witness to. They don't believe that God is in control of our lives nor do they believe Jesus is any more than a man yet they pray in His name. They don't believe that God heals the sick they believe that the healing comes from the person who is sick and the Dr.s They do pray that the person will have the strength to heal but the healing isn't from GOD. There seems to be a lot of double talk and this book helped me to understand the control that this cult has over the people who belong to it and answered my many questions. I would highly recommend it to any one that has any questions about this cult.
4,Best Cougar manual out there,Overall has the best information. A manual that a beginner or experienced person can understand. Excellent book for mechanical or restorative use.
4,Barry Does It Best - Makes You Sing!,"This particular concert is very good. The music he chooses and the order he performs them is excelelnt.The qulaity of this DVD is great to. Enhanced audio making it sound like your really at a concert with him.For fans of Manilow this is a must to own. For non-fans this is a great sample of his work and style. Barry is a performer and is very down-to-earth in his delivery.He shows he has humor, compassion and a lot of energy. He also presents himself as a real person. Quips about his hometown and family too. You'll probably be familiar with all his songs and delight at his on stage personality. This is something the whole family will enjoy!"
2,Dress had a small hole in it,Dress took more time to arrive than I thought necessary. When I received the dress there was a small hole in it. I've had several issues lately with purchasing products via Amazon.com's vendors.
5,Haunting!,"It has been a couple of months since I watched these disks over about a week. I then gave the set to a friend who did the same. It now seems that every day I have a flashback to that viewing or something will trigger the memory. I don't know exactly why, but this story and this telling of it linger on the mind. It's as though I was there living it, the memory is that deep. Now, isn't that what storytelling is all about?"
4,John Adams,"Outstanding adaptation of the book. The last part is a bit melodramatic, but still first rate. Highly recommended for any history nuts."
5,Frame by Frame,"This is one of the best made movies in both a historical and cinematic way. I saw it on tv first, but with the Blu-ray , it jumps off the screen. You feel that you are experiencing the times, both good and bad.Paul Giamatti is the best John Adams ever. One of the few movies that you wish it wouldn't end"
4,John Adams DVD's - Judy's review,"I bought the DVD's because I had read and very much enjoyed the book. The movie version gives a better picture of what the individuals looked like. I also feel that I have a better idea of what they were thinking. However, on balance, I liked the book a little better than the movie. The way that John and Abigail expressed themselves in their letters to each other is so very articulate and caring and thoughtful and beautiful."
5,A great way to celebrate the 4th of July,"This was a fantastic way to celebrate the fourth of July. There was little fan-faire during those early years. The freedom we have and take for granted, was a hard fought battle in 1776 just as it was 20, 40, even 200 years later. We watched the event as a family with the ""Facts are a stubborn thing"" feature turned-on. This gave more meaning to the beautiful and magnificent acting of Paul Giamatti and Laura Linney as John and Abigail Adams. A definite must see."
2,Too Much and Not Enough,"I was very excited to see this production only to be dissapointed by the bad choice of camera angles and too much ""Shakey Cam"". I have yet to get pass the first three episodes. I undrestand the effect they were going for, use of a steady cam to simulate actually ""being there"" but to use it when a couple is lying in bed having a conversation is ridiculous. I found it annoying to watch. The crooked camera angles are reminiscent of the old 60's Batman series. I found it very distracting from the story being told that I just had to turn it off."
5,Should be required viewing in every US History class.,An absolutely superb series showing the trails and tribulations our founding fathers endured for us to be where we are today. Highly recommended.
5,Superb detal and quality,"This mini-series is of great quality and entertainment. It's fairly accurate to history, and presents it in a way that will keep non-history buffs interested. Great buy!"
5,great dvd of a wonderful story in our nation's history,This is a great DVD set. I recommend it for all you history buffs out there.
5,AMAZING,"HBO out did itself with the production of this series. A great buy for any fan of good films, teachers, or anyone who loves the quality that HBO puts into their work."
3,John Adams,"I gave it three stars for technical reasons, not subject matter. The production is very well done and should be seen by all. I first saw this on a rental and the dvd would halt the action in spurts and would sometimes take up to a minute to restart itself. At times it would take 3 to 5 minutes just to get through a short phrase. I chalked thia up to the dvd being a rental.However, the discs I purchased through you are doing the same thing. It is not my dvd player becasue other dvds play normally. I would have returned them but by the time I first watched it, it was past the 30 day time limit."
4,Refresher Course on President John Adams,"The John Adams miniseries was well done, informative and accurate, portraying the struggles of our emerging nation. In addition, it's a great refresher course in early American history. It is my hope that similar biographies of U.S. presidents will be made. I would certainly buy such products."
3,Kind of Dull,"This series was a bit of a let down. I was expecting more, having read some excellent Revolutionary War books, Jeff Shaara's 'Rise to Rebellion' and 'The Glorious Cause' among them. The problem is that this series was based on David McCullough's book of the same name, which was a bore, just like his '1776' was a bore. I guess having read books of a broader scope, narrowing the focus to only John Adams chopped out so much more that was interesting. '1776' would have been a better series, providing McCullough wasn't the sole source. PS: 'Rome' and 'Deadwood' were the best HBO series of all time. Full stop."
1,John Adams,"Excellent historical drama. Should be required viewing for all students in elementary, middle and high school. Wonderful performances by all involved."
1,I don't need to see ads for other DVDs,"I have watched the series first DVD so far and I am sick of the movie studios and HBO policy, which seems to think it is alright to force the buyer to watch ads for the first five minutes of each disk. They do not allow you to skip these ads and they waste my time and annoy me. So far, I have not gotten to the later disks for this reason. Buy the book. It is excellent."
4,Great Miniseries,"I have been watching this series episode by episode, and have been enjoying it very much. I have visited the homes of John Adams and John Quincy Adams, and also read David McCullough's excellent book. I look forward to owning it when it is released. I just pre-ordered ""The Adams Chronicles"", the outstanding PBS minseries from 1976, and can't wait to get it."
5,Powerful... illuminating,Was pleasantly surprised by the extensive work put into the period props. You feel like you are back in the 1770's. Paul Giamotti and Laura Finney are exceptional and intense. Ben Franklin and Thomas Jefferson come to life. Very well done... enjoyable.
4,John Adams miniseries - disappointing,While the quality of the production was excellent I was disappointed in some of the portrayed negative character traits of our founding fathers - especially John Adams. The series started out strong but deteriorated into an account of a man who pretty much abandoned his family for the sake of his country - and then even that was questioned. Did he do it for his country or to just to make himself look good in the eyes of others? I have no desire to watch the series a second time.
5,Fabulous Miniseries,"I have nothing bad to say about this miniseries. I felt very grateful for my forefather and foremother John and Abigail Adams, but did not walk away from this film with any illusions that they were perfect. These were broken men and women who achieved greatness from which I benefit."
5,John Adams,We watched this a couple years ago. We thought it was a great series. It was a Christmas present for my brother.
5,BRAVO!,"This production marks a highpoint in the medium. It entertains you and makes you feel intelligent at the same time. The picture of history that it paints shouts with authenticity, and the insights into the personalities of the founding fathers is enthralling. This very well may be the release that forces me to start going Bluray. Well done!"
5,Great Series,I thoroughly enjoy this time period in American History. This seven part series illustrates with great dramatic effect the lives and histories of our forefathers.
5,Great Movie,"Love ths movie, have watched it twice now, once without the facts on sreen and once with. Excellent histoical facts"
5,Really great for the size,"This product is one of the smallest sets on the market and since air travel has gotten so strict about how many bags you can carry on, it really is perfect for travel!"
1,Blames the victim....,"Palestine, Palestinians & International Law is this:Israel is always wrongPalestinians are always right.This is a piece of garbage."
2,Not quite what I was hoping for.,"I have a son who is 7 (entering 2nd grade) and really into super heros. I ordered this book (and the second book in the series) for him in the hopes that they would encourage him to read. That didn't quite happen. Eventhough he loved the story (I read it to him) and the illustrations are imaginative, the reading level of the book was way too hard for him! I actually was shocked at how difficult some of the words were. And, since it is not a chapter book, I am not sure it will be one he will pick up when he is at that reading level required by the book."
5,"""Creative Ideas for Applying Patterns to Every Room""","This book, originally published in England, provides charming examples of how to use stencils to enhance indoor living areas and objects. The photos include a range of different house styles. The choice of colors is inspiring and helpful. There is a section on Trompe L'Oeil also. The subtitle clearly indicates that this is NOT a book of stencils, such as are readily available from Dover."
2,Certainly not Collins's best work,"I bought this collection of three novellas by Wilkie Collins after having read and studied all of his other novels, including the well-known ""Woman in White."" I was surprised, given his other fiction, that these novellas were so far-fetched as to be ridiculous, with characters that are no more than caricatures: the husband-murdering foreign countess, the jealous older fiancee, the crazed and obsessive lover. Naturally, the plots are utterly predictable. Unless you're a scholar doing your dissertation on Wilkie Collins and obliged to read every last scrap of his writing, I would not recommend that anyone waste time reading what is (and would have been in its day) cheap, sensational trash."
2,A disappointing read,"Like many of us, I'm busy and I take my reading seriously. I picked up Under the Lake at the library and was intrigued by Stephen King's review on the back cover. I normally don't read mysterys of this sort, but thought I'll give this one a whirl. It was a disappointing read. I feel cheated. I wish I had chosen another book to spend time with. I found the plot unbelievable and trite. A total waste of reading time."
2,Mundane,"Sooo, this is the dreaded ""back to roots"" album. Whether influenced by critics or sales results, the group has decided to go ""less glossy"" & give it the punchy rock treatment. They don't do it badly, they just don't do it distinctly. James Walsh et al have had a great ear for melody, but this is lost in an effort to hammer out what is essentially an undistinguished pastiche of guitar pop/rock. Hopefully they will come back with a more worked out product next go."
2,Not one of the best,"First, there were a couple of good things about this player. I like that it charges on the computer. My first MP3 player ran on batteries. You can also put pictures on it. I really don't have a need to have pictures on my MP3 player, but it's interesting if you want to carry some pictures around.This is what I don't like:1. The package said that a full charge would last around 15 hours, but mine did not seem to last nearly that long. I've heard that having the volume on a high setting makes the battery go down faster, but I didn't have the volume set very high on mine.2. On your computer, you can't rename files or play them directly on from your player. If you want to rename a file, you have to copy it, paste it somewhere else, change the name there, then copy it again and move it back to the player.3. This player comes with earbuds. This isn't necessarily bad, but if you prefer earphones (like me), you'll have to get a pair from somewhere. I used the ones from my old MP3 player."
3,Too Chill,"I've heard David Harness spin at Universe, Taboo and The Endup. This release isn't even as hard as his gospel house sets at Taboo. I believe his best work was in the wee hours of the morning at the now defunct Fag Fridays. I urged him to release something along those lines, similar to Roger Sanchez's ruff house releases, but with obviously no success. Nevertheless, it is a good ""chill"" house release."
4,A FORMER DRAGON,"As a former member of the ""Dragon Force"", I just want to take the opportunity to thank COL Antal for this great book. I was a platton leader in TF 2-72 during COL Antal's command, and it was exciting to read about the unit, as well as the many locations mentioned in the story that I am familiar with from my tour. Currently an Active-duty Army officer serving in HQ SFOR, the ""Proud Legions"" brought me back to those days as a young Lieutenant with my Bradley platoon. As the stereotypical ""LT"", I made my share of mistakes, but in the 2-72 Armor, I was allowed to learn from those mistakes, lead my soldiers, and feel I was part of something greater. Working as a staff officer, I forgot about those heady days as a platoon leader in Dragon Force, manning the ""walls"" in a real word situation. Proud Legions reminded me of why I wanted to be a soldier. Thank You."
3,Great warrior - decent writer,"John F. Antal deserves our heartfelt thanks for his service to our country in Korea and elsewhere. He is a true patriot who has put it all on the line for freedom. It seems he was born a warrior first, and a writer second. That is just fine though, and I would recommend the book highly for those who enjoy ""what-if"" military history.A couple of episodes in the book I questioned. Such as when an NKPA tank officer was ""surprised"" the Americans had thermal sights that could see through smoke. I think, even at the time the events were depicted, the North Koreans would have known better and not gotten their entire brigade destroyed. If I am wrong, please correct me.Also, I would recommend Antal's tactical decision books greatly if you can find them."
2,A Tank Commander's Fantasy,"The basic scenario is a real one to be concerned about, and LTC Antal certainly understands the workings of an armor battalion. But for those wondering how a North Korean invasion might actually progress, I might suggest that this is not the book for you.The North Koreans are keystone cops in this narrative. Their formations totally lack any intel about where the Americans are; their commando strikes early in the book have no visible effect on the war effort.The result is that North Korean tanks blindly stumble into prepared American positions with predictable results. It's pretty much a dream scenario for a tank battalion commander. Believe it or not, there's actually *another* turkey shoot later in the book. Add in an improbable romantic sideshow, and you have pretty much a battalion commander's fantasy of the best that a war in Korea could possibly go.The result is a remarkably complacent story by an author who is usually lucid and authorative."
3,A nice attempt but no Red Phoenix !!!,To put this in a nutshell I did enjoy this book. I could only ask for more detail in his next book.
3,A field grade officer's view of the Army,"LTC Antal's book is technically correct, with a very real and plausible premise. But I couldn't get over the fact that the characters are too stereotypical. This is a field grade officer's view (or wish) of what his soldiers are like, and how units operate. This stereotypical behavior trivializes what small unit leaders do and how units operate. I hope the author's intent was entertainment and not reality."
5,Amazing!! MUST HAVE ALBUM!!,"Erin Boheme album is AMAZING!! Her whole album is full of incredible standard and originals. My favorite is ""Someone To Love"". The song have very full emotion and such beautiful tune. I also adore ""One Night With Frank"". How she combine Frank's song title into one amazing song. Trust me it sound so good. The wonderful amazing musicians that she work with in the album. Just to amazing for words. She got the best team in Jazz. I can't believe she is only 19 yrs old.. I love the whole cd and I have gotten all my friends and family her cd. Everyone sure enjoy it. Everyone will be singing and dancing along in no time..This is a MUST HAVE album.."
3,A great start!,"Not only is this a very nice debut recording, but it has certainly sparked some interesting commentary. I hope no one takes too seriously the comments of Mr. Rosenzweig - his ludicrous comment about Ms. Boheme not being alive during ""Frank's time"" says it all - anyone involved in the jazz community knows that current generations of musicians always take inspiration from earlier artists. This is, after all, an early career statement from Ms. Boheme. It shows a lot of talent, a clear - and in tune - delivery, some great arrangements (bravo to Christian Scott's trumpet). Over-produced - obviously, why else allow the density of some of the arrangments to weigh things down? But the listening public should indeed be thnakful that there are young artists out there who are concerned with making great music. Give them a chance to develop some maturity, and the results should be quite promising."
3,Pleased,This product was simple to install the instructions were simple. Would definitely purchase again easy to follow instructions and mounting was easy
3,Eddie Money: Average artist still going strong.,"The music's pretty good, provided you were a fan of this 80's B-artist, but it's a bit staggering that he looks so bad. Still, his voice is still strong and gruff, as it ought to be. And he appears here with a fairly strong, young band, and they put a nice spin with occasional flourishes on the old hits. Money's music holds up well after 20 years because it has strong rock fundamentals, but having said that, the songs just weren't that outstanding at the outset. The critical consideration here is, if you didn't like Eddie then, you're not likely to now. And vice-versa."
4,Could Someone Give Us a Track Listing?,"I recently purchased the Shakin' With the Money Man audio cd. In it they advertised the concert video on VHS and now DVD version. The advertisement said there were two bonus tracks on the video. This was abviously the encore to the show. I think one is Trinidad, but don't know the other. Could somone please give us a complete track listing."
4,cute and comfy,"these shoes are really cute and they dont hurt my feet, but the picture looks like they are soft yellow in color, when they arived, they looked more of a green-yellow color."
3,The original is better,"Why do they always do this? Re-record a great album only to make it worse. Maybe it is now digital but so what? What they've lost is the marvelous feeling of the original and some superb soloing (check out the bent note at the end of ""Melba"" on the original). Also, how the heck could they leave off ""Dialogue in the Rain?"" This is the one piece I bought this CD for and it wasn't there! This is a terrible shame because it's such a beautiful piece of music. The two additional pieces are nice but they don't make the album a five star for me. Please, will someone re-release the original ""Original Soundtrack?"" In my opinion it's a much better album."
1,My shells had expired before they ever shipped,We love Annie's white cheddar at our house. That's why I bought the case. I was certainly disappointed with the chalky consistency of the product we received. Then we noticed the date stamped on the cheese powder package--it had already expired months before I even ordered it. My kids won't eat it. Very disappointing.
5,Annies is a daily lunch,My kids love annies and it is so much better for them than Kraft. They only eat a few things and this fits their taste and our desire to keep them healthy.
2,The Debate over Christianity,"A more appropriate title for this book is how to hate catholicism. I feel that I have joined a religious cult just by reading this book. By stereotyping catholics, it lends no justice to its comparisons. Calling the arguments biased is an understatement. Perhaps if the author knew something about catholicism, he could make an intelligent argument. Instead, he bring us down to his level.This book was recommended by a teacher of mine. Based on his recommendation, I have lost faith in him. I would have thought he had stronger reasoning ability to form independent thought."
3,This is a so-so movie,"I like its morbid personality, but overall it was just a ok movie. Or a avrege type of movie. Nothing I would buy or watch more then once, unless there was nothing ales to watch and there was nothing ales to do. but for a rainy day movie I would give this five stars. But on general it only gets three stars."
1,Wasted my Money,"This movie is not my cup of tea.It sounded like a good movie when I was reading about it.But it turned out be at times very boring,and I forever had to adjust the volume on almost every scene.I wasted my time and my money.Maybe somebody will buy it at my Garage sale for 50 cent."
1,Pathetic Little Drama,"I thought German/Austrian people had had a long history of film-making, watching this pathetic little drama unfold made me think otherwise. It is about a counterfeiter called something or other who is forced to make fake dollar/pounds bills at a - yawn!! - concentration camp. The sets were of such poor quality and cost-cutting so evident that it was really shocking. I had an almost claustrophobic feeling; as if some amateur actors got together, selected an abandoned warehouse in erstwhile East German town, discussed a script whilst drinking beer and eating sausages rolls and presto, they get an Oscar. I wouldn't even dare to compare it with classics like Schindler's List. This movie is almost obscene! It leaves you so totally cold and untouched! It is even worse than our Bollywood Musicals starring ugly Shah Rukh Khan or Lilliput Aamir Khan!"
1,Ok here we go,WrestleMania 21 is the best game............SIKE!!!!!!!!!!!! This game sucks a** WTF where they thinkin making a game like this the comercial looks mad hot but when u play it u just say the comercial stright up LIED. Torrie wilson is not even in the game and jazz is WTF is that and the highest overall us 84 everyone in that game is like overall 75 Im like WTF everyone is this game is wack. u can't even play the special matches like hell in the cell or TLC with more than 2 people u either play it with two people or nothing no 3 or 4 player. I tell what wrestle mania is good for..........FOR MAKING U WASTE YOUR MONEY
2,BAD NEWS,Wrestlemaina 21 was a disater when I played it there was a lot of glitchs like on time I was and he flew and got title when we played a TLC.You should blame the person who made this. Im warning you not to buy it because its a half made game. This is Kyle Francis reporting BAD NEWS. THE ONLY REASON WHY THE RATING IS A TWO IS BECAUSE THE GRAPHICS IT SHOULD HAE BEEN 1
2,It's funny...,"I purchased this same game for $14.95 and I thought it was outrageously overpriced. The controls are strenuous and needlessly complicated. The sound and music aren't too impressive either consisting mostly of loud rock beats and repetitive play-by-play. The gameplay is completely ruined by the terrible control and lack of characters(around forty I believe). The replay value is practically nonexistent with a pathethic Story Mode, a rather bland Online Mode and an absence of many important stipulation matches. The graphics are transcendent, but that won't save it from receiving a bad rating. Overall I just think this game could've been enjoyable if not for the complete lack of effort by the designers. The graphics save this game from receiving one star, but that's about it. Save your money or just rent it. It isn't worth $14.95, and it sure as hell isn't worth $49.95!"
1,MAJOR DISSAPOINTMENT,"If u are excited because u have xbox and ur a wwe fan I have bad news. Stick to raw 2, if u thought that xbox wrestling games couldn't get anyworse u are wrong. First of all though there are good graphics the glitches destroyed the entire game. For an example I was usin edge then all of a sudden his hair grew to the mat. Another hideous glitch is that people dissapear at random and appear in new locations. Every game has bugs but the glitches are so extreme that you might want to turn off the xbox and bring the game back to the store.Story mode is okay. some problems are that u have to use a created player and there is only one storyline which you have no control of like in smackdown vs. raw. the loading times are outragoues and it isn't for good causesOverall I don't think you should even rent this game. I am sorry wwe fans who have xbox but this is a major letdown."
1,Worst Wrestling game ever........,"When this game was not freezing up, it was ok, but since THQ does not really want you to play the game its hard to give it a real review, I don't know if they rushed this game or not, but seriously, if Wal-Mart does not give my money back then I am going to be ticked off. Don't buy this game and send THQ a message that you can't pee in a cup and claim it's Tasters Choice!"
5,Life Saver,"This book saved my life. When I was in the grips of my addiction I didnt know where to turn. Fortunately I found the Big Book of Alcoholics Anonymous and the program outlined inside. To this day I must give the credit to AA for the transformation of my life. Highly recommended for those suffering from addiction, family members, friends, and counselors in the field of addiction."
4,Inspiring,Found this to be so helpful. Had little time to read the BB other than in small spurts...listening to the BB on tape helped so much. The narrator's voice was a bit mundane but enjoyed it - listened to it 2x than gave it to a friend.
2,Whats so big about it?,This book was actually small! And to top it off it is a bunch of stories about people who drink too much. I just dont get it.
5,Alcoholic Anonymous big book 4th edition,I was very pleased with the quality of my purchase and the quick delivery. I highly recommend purchasing from seller and would do so myself.
2,Not so sure.,I have used this product for yrs. but have never bought it online before. It somehow doesn't seem to be the same product I have used . Maybe older or sat in sun or something else. Not sure. I am using it.
1,worst vampire movie ever,"well i dont know what type of taste, these other people have, but compared to any other vampire movie i ever so this is trash, not worth the money, they should be ashamed to put something like this on blu-ray, when there are far way far much better movies out there,"
3,A Mixed Bag from Hammer,"This was a hard to find Hammer classic before this release, and having it on Blu-ray in a combo package with a DVD for those who don't have a Blu-ray player is a nice touch. The movie itself looks great -- despite the naysayers -- and has some interesting twists and turns. Good circus props, a fine theme, and, even though I then to prefer the ""old"" Hammer"" vampire movies made by Terence Fisher and Freddie Francis, this one does a good job of pushing the limits (can't say how or I'll spoil it for you). The Bad News: Like so many other horror movies, it all falls apart at the end -- it's rushed! -- and because the two principal vampires aren't good actors -- they're over the top in every way, especially their costumes and makeup --put on with a trowel. We need vampires who have and have learned the subtleties required. Still, ""Vampire Circus"" is worth watching. I'm not unhappy I bought this one and added it to my Hammer collection."
2,Dark Movie,"I have been waiting for 20 years for this to be released in the USA. The bad news is that the movie is very dark. The opening scene that takes place in daylight appears to be at night. The last scene is a bat flying away but the bat can't be seen anywhere. It's just a black screen shot. If you watch the ""Making OF"" feature, the bat is clearly there and it almost looks like dawn is breaking. There is obviously something wrong with my copy. I've emailed Synapse Films to find out. I want to return mine for another copy, but it seems they're on back order. Hopefully, I won't need to wait another 20 years.*UPDATE* Synapse Films has emailed back on 1/3/11 to say that the print they have IS dark, so that's the best we'll get. Bummer."
1,Dark Circus,"Vampire Circus as presented by Synapse is way too dark, in fact it is so dark and muddy that the pink opening credit 'A Hammer Production' is no longer pink, but some indescribable shade of murky blue! All the details are almost lost and this is a terrible shame. If you wish to 'SEE' the film in a much better presentation, I say watch the standard definition UK Carlton DVD and forget about this awful transfer. Maybe Synapse had their heart in the right place, but the end result needs recalling and correcting. In fact, I have not seen a Hammer film darkened so much since the terrible Warner VHS of Taste the Blood of Dracula... What's worse is the synical excuses that have surfaced in the wake of similar criticism, of presenting the film closer to how it was allegedly 'intended' to be screened. What a farrago! And I thought Bluray was supposed to heighten our viewing experience! Very disappointed. Film *** Transfer *"
1,I got a wrong version,"I got a wrong version, not the 2009 version stated on web. I sent e-mail to the seller, no response."
2,Superficial travelogue,"This is a disappointingly superficial 'analysis' of feminism in islamic areas; it is really more of a travelogue with feminism as a loose theme. More attention is paid to the colorful sights, food, characters, clothing, etc. than to any depth of perception or analysis of women's lives and feminism."
2,"Fascinating, but problematic","This is without a doubt the most informative book I've ever read. The lessons learned are innumerable, invaluable, and unforgettable. Fernea however, is irrepressibly annoying. Not only does she seem unbelievably ignorant about the cultures she studies, especially for such an accredited ""expert"", but she clings firmly to her own misconceptions and stereotypes, regardless of what her interviewees may say. I give her credit though, for being so honest. In that position, I might have tried to make it sound like I knew what I was talking about."
3,Not bad for the price,I've used this kit for a few months and it works just fine. I've used them on several lenses both zooms and primes.I like the case and its great they are stackable. Don't expect to preform true macro work with these lenses they are just fine for experimenting though.
5,Amazing Pipes!,"This woman's first CD is incredibly powerful. She fills an unfortunate void in the world of dance. Mixing gospel sounds and house beats, Rosie will keep you grooving and longing for more."
5,"great thriller, better than Grisham and Turrow combined","A wonderful mystery which keeps one guessing until the end. As a career prosecutor, I am often wary of stories where the main character is wrongly accused. Most such novels have little basis in reality and play to the general public's belief that the police intentionally seek to convict innocent persons. D.R. Schanker has taken this basic premise and written a believable, yet suspenseful novel.Mr. Schanker, as a former law clerk, portrays the complexities of the appellate system with an accurate desciption of the many pitfalls of legal procedure and practice. I would highly recommend this book to anyone seeking a fresh and exciting murder mystery."
5,Monkey Love,"This story was fast paced, funny, yet not in an entirely slapstick way. The humor was excellent and delivered in a well-timed fashion. It seemed perhaps Ms. Scott Royce has herself tried stand up comedy.I bought this book thinking of romance and ended up appreciating the many levels of the dysfunctional family, and having a distinct hankering to walk the streets of New York again. Oh, and I did fall in love, just not with the hero. Don't get me wrong, he's perfectly lovable, but I fell in love with the monkey. Long live Tallulah."
5,Gloria Estefan - Live in Miami,This is subtitled and terrific! I wasn't sure if it was subtitled - but it did come with subtitles. Was very happy about it.
2,kottonmouth klick,"FAmily barb Q'z enjoy sunday afternoons , hippies in the parks all trippin off shrooms,, Best aLbum Ever besides Shaky bones Green Room in the world, Y2KmK John BLizz"
2,nice looking,"bulking, but camera hole note usable it does't line up. the strapes and handles are in the way... very dissappionted"
5,a Lush and Sexy treat that you just can't get enough of,"I -as a lot of other VC lovers- discovered them through Buffy, I'm a huge fan of the show, and so I bought the soundtrack (there are a lot of great artists on here , and if you like Velvet Chain I think you also like Bif Naked - I bificus, K's choice and Rasputina - thanks for the ether.) But, about Velvet Chain, well.....they rule, I've only got the buffy E.P. (still looking for warm) but this cd is a Lush treat which you will just love! it starts off with the delightfully dark 'bufy' which -even if you don't like the show- is just a terrific song, and the rest..well, it doesn't get worse ;) the music isn't too complicated or anything but it's beautiful, the vocals are sharp and pure, the lyrics are fun and easy, and all together it's fantastic. if you like good music, buy this cd."
5,My 2 1/2 year old loves this!,"As an adult you have to get past the appearance of Miss Patty cake, but compared to Barney.hmmmmmmmmm. Anyway, my sonloves this videa, and goes around the house singing the songs.For a christian family, it gives an alternate venue for explaining Easter...in a fun and informative manner."
3,Liked it enough to order another,There is a series of these and I got the Hindenburg one next. I think that was better. Kept me reading anyway.
5,Szeryng rocks II!,"I first encountered Szeryng in a performance of Tchaikovsky's Violin Concerto and was ""bitten"". This is a great collaboration with Haebler and very enjoyable. Szeryng's violin just sings!!"
1,No way!,This is totally amateurville. Worse! All I did was listen to the samples and I wouldn't buy this if it was the only karaoke version around (and it's not). The orchestra is WAY out of tune! I cannot even believe that Amazon would put this on their site.
2,Less noticeable effect than other pantethine supplements that I've tried.,"I've been using pantethine to help me with what I've diagnosed as candida-control (read sugar) issues.This supplement by NOW compares less favorably, in my experience, to brands such as Pure Encapsulations and Source Naturals."
3,This book is for advanced statistics only,"While this book is one of the most extensive books on the subject is is not for beginners. This book should only be bought for people who have taken a stat/prob course before. Be wary of his proofs, not all are in the book. I recomend it for math majors as well as actuary students, but not for engineers and science majors."
4,I see the light,I have been trying to get into security for a while but the task seemed daunting. Security is a complex subject and it is difficult to know where to start. The book's hyperlink-like structure allows you the understand the whole picture and navigate through the chapters easily without being drowned in details too quickly. This book I think must be read twice to finally put in straight in my mind.Thanks Keith.
2,More like a cookbook,"Its more like a cook book written in bunch of 4-5 page sections that describe how to do what with .Net sceurity namespaces. If you are looking for book that described windows security then get Keith's ""Windows Security Programming"" book."
1,Even Worse,"Some of the reviews for this recording were negative in nature.I must say, after listening to it, I have to say that the reviewers were being kind. It is worse than anyone said. Forall the talent available on the side of the performers, it is AMAZING that such a piece of nauseating fluff could be created.Maybe it is a joke album, but I, for one, am not laughing. Maybethe musicians had their tongues in their cheeks so far they couldnot play their instruments properly."
2,Disappointed,"Although the level of detail is fantastic, it does not look good when worn as a pendant. The jaw hangs at an awkward 90 degree angle that it looks stupid. Sad, but unacceptable; so i had to return it."
3,borrrrrrring but still worth listening to,jd saying he writes his own material no producer or rapper these days are 100% creative and I damn sho know he did'nt make basketball up kurtis blow did. the rest of this is boring to me nothing new or creative just kiddie stuff.
4,A Must Have For Hendrix Fans,"Seeing this video adds new dimensions to experiencing Hendrix's music. You can see how Hendrix produces the sounds that come from his guitar. As a guitar player, it is fasinating to see Hendrix in action. Also, if you are into theatrics, he burns his guitar at the conclusion of the concert. A historic concert event not to be missed."
4,Brought Me to Tears,"The cello is one of my favorite instruments (along with the piano and the harp), and I favor Brahms' soul.This work just convinced me more of why Yo-Yo Ma is one of the present best cellists. Ax is a little dull and ""technical"" for Brahms, yes, but Ma still gives the music justice and a slightly different perspective.At times, Ma's conviction and passion brought me to tears, esp Track IV: Allegro Vivace. The warmth and depth of the music and the playing make for a CD perfect to accompany a cup of tea and a book, or just meditation."
2,Yo-Yo Ma stumbles,"Skip it. Yo-Yo Ma is arguably the best cellist around today, but you will not know it from this recording. Perhaps it is the fault of a not very good technical recording? Perhaps Emanuel Ax is on the dull side? I personally think that Mr. Ma just did not ""get it"". Brahms music has an introspective quality that shines in those cello sonatas more than anywhere else perhaps. This has to be played with your soul, taking risks. Ma and Ax just are technical. If you wonder what I mean, try to find the Isserlis/Evans version. You will know."
2,Should be Called Small Business for DUMMIES,"This might make a good book for your teenage kid trying to learn about small business but other than that I dont think it would be helpful. If you really want the details of how to create and grow a real business (especialy high tech) and get funded, you should read ""The Startup Company Bible for Entrepreneurs"" (Stathis). It makes this book looks like preschool."
2,"Cute but, very poorly made!","My son loves Mickey Mouse so his grandmother bought this comforter set for Christmas. It's sooo soft and very cute and he just loves it but, it already has a lot of tears and holes because the material is pretty cheap. And the sheets shrink after washing and the pillow case doesn't fit the pillow correctly. I gave it 2 stars because it's cute but, I wouldn't recommend it."
2,No Show,My review of this item is that I have not received my copy of the replacement plan yet. So right now I am not very happy.
4,It gave me 100% return of my bad product,I bought this product with a Magellan GPS. My original manufacturing warranty was for 3 months. That GPS stopped working 11 months. I called to customer care and then shipped the entire defective product. Last Friday I got a refund check of entire product cost. I am happy with the service.
2,GG Allin,"I tried getting into this album, and besides it being mislabeled as having an extra track or two, just not for me."
1,"If you truly are an ..., then you will like this one.","This book was completely worthless to me. It has no specific information about how to file bankruptcy or avoid it. If you need someone to pat you on the back and say ""everything will be all right"" but not offer any constructive solutions, then this might just be the book for you. For those with more substance in mind, I would suggest one of the NOLO books. They actually know what they are talking about."
2,Routine in the Sixth Sym. but an attractive program,"As a program this is an attractive CD. Prokofiev's Sixth Sym. is seriously nelgected in the catalog, and here we have a first-rate orchestra, the National Symphony, in quite good osund from 1996. They play well for Slatkin, who unfortunatley finds little inner life in the score--his lumpish Sixth is a thing of fitful gestures and no overall purpose. There's some energy in the Scherzo but even that is without spark.Better is the Over. on Hebrew Themes in its orchestral guise--it's one of Prokofiev's most attractive short works. Rather than bringing out its Jewishn folk flavor, Slatkin plays it as blandly as early Samuel Barber. The spiky suite from The Love of Three Oranges shows a bit more spark, but not enough to resuce a routine outing. One is left to ponder what hapened after Slatkin's early promise."
5,tell hell i aint coming,This is a good play. It make you sit back and really wonder about your life and which way are you going. Up or down.
3,fantastic 80'sn extended,In addition to the great review above (or is below now).The milli vanilli track is edited/ fades out at 6:30. The original 12inch of this runs 8:50 (available on a long OOP cd called maxi summer hits). The terence trent dárby track is the 3 coins in a fountain mix that could be found on the bonus disc with his greatest his cd. The george michael track is simply the single/album version. I personally purchased this one for the easy lover track and feld ripped as it was the ordinary album version.
2,The book was full of errors and it was not a good read.,This book was so boring I really did not learn anything the book was full or errors. I fell asleep on this one please don't write anymore books.
4,good general info,I am using DSMO with more confidence after reading the book and I'm having some success also. I want more books like this one.
5,DMSO Nature's Healer,A very insightful book that gives me a better understanding of the product and its value to the human body in combating disease.I hope this book will open the minds of people to understanding that diseases can be overcome and there are cures for ailments that the establishment says there isn't. Used properly DMSO can help a great deal of suffering in this world.
1,Plain FRUSTRATING,"Let me start off by saying that as far as I can remember, every time I buy anything with Mavis Beacon, it's always suxs. I didn't buy this one, my friend did. She bought two different versions, both gave her problems to even just begin to use the stupid program. Every time we tried to use it, the program would ask us for a password, that of course, the program did not provide. We thought she might of lost it, so she bought the program again. And AGAIN, the program asked for a password which the package DID NOT INCLUDE! Just to login, it was a maze. Once you are on the program, it's so rigid. We only see a practice of the home keys. What happen to the other set of keys that you want to practice on?! I hate this program!"
4,Different kind of Elfman; Standard Smith,"This is a half-decent soundtrack. Danny Elfman's work here is good, but it's quite different than his other scores. It's much more lighthearted than his score for MIB1, much like this film's tone. His work here isn't even as good as is other summer score, ""Spider-Man."" Still, this is a good soundtrack. Will Smith's new song is pretty good, but it's nothing like his previous MIB song. However, this doesn't kill the entire CD...If you like Danny Elfman, buy this disc. If you only like Will Smith buy his new CD (which has this new MIB song on it)."
4,Simplisticly easy,"There's not much the can be said badly about this player, the worse trouble I've had with it is the strap coming off one side, but only when in my backpack, it's a great player for the price, and the 'splash/sweat proof covering' that is the shell is one the main reason's I got it and so far it's worked out very well. Have had for a couple months. Also, if you have a reg usb power cord it will charge and play which helps on road trips or when battier is low at work."
5,MP3 player is great!,This is my first MP3 player. It is very easy to load music onto and to use. I am very happy with it.
5,Malcolm X,"This is a book about Malcolm X and what he has accomplished in his life. This book tells how he inherited the name Malcolm X. It tells about all his encounters with other famous leaders including Martin Luther King JR., Elijah Muhammad, and others. This book tells about his family, how he became an Islam ruler, and what he did to try to make the world a better place. I recommend this book to any readers interested in the life of Malcolm X or readers that are just interested in a good biography."
3,situational ethics at its best....,this should taught in class rooms to show what is wrong with the victim mentality in this country.
2,Sonic Gives Edited Sonic X Purchase Advice,"Kids, Theres' nothing more cool than watching Sonic if its' something you like, but if somebody tries to sell you a badly edited 4Kids version with sans intense violence and bad dialouge, and it comes off as something that makes you feel uncomfortable, thats' NO Good. Its' your Sonic, noone has the right to butcher the original Japanease version if you dont' want them to, so what do you do? First you say ""NO"", then, you get outta there"
1,Save your money,"I just watched this last night and it was laughably awful. The original is fun to watch and a very memorable story, ect. But this storyline is an embarrasment. Unless you are buying this for a VERY small child your money can be better spent elsewhere."
1,did not work,I was trying to seal various sized bottles to prevent evaporation and the material was not conducive to effect a waterproof seal in my application
2,Nice book for a collection,"I bought this book mainly because I buy any book that deals with woodworking. The book does cover many aspect of woodworking, but unfortunately not very in depth. Some project are included, but for plans there are way better resources and books available. The way the dinner table is constructed (and construction explained) is very poor. If you are looking for a definitive handbook... keep on looking."
3,"If you know Beethoven, you don't need this.","This is a fair-to-middling CD, containing no real gems or duds. Of course, it has ""Fur Elise"" and ""Moonlight Sonata,"" but you can get those tunes on ANY Beethoven comp. I bought this because it was the cheapest CD I could find with the ""Pathetique"" piano sonata on it--the one Karl Haas uses as the theme to his ""Adventures in Good Music."" I used it for a weeding album. So it's pop, so what?The bottom line here is that most of the music WILL put you to sleep--because it's not Beethoven's best work; but, the CD is cheap and, if it has anything you want on it, it's worth it on the cost-effective front."
4,Works for high school daughter,I bought this shoe for my 14 yr old daughter. She needs padding in the heal area since her feet are narrow. This pair did the trick...and I haven't heard any complaints. And I even purchased it a tad bit larger for her to grow into...
5,Shoes ordered,Great job in quick delivery. The shoes are so comfortable and great prize for a great shoe. Thanks!
1,"never recieved, was sent to wrong address across the country.","ive used these plates before. they are very professional and stylish, i just didnt get my order."
3,Great product but too expensive now,"I can't believe Oral-B has discontinued the Hummingbird Flosser. It is the only thing that encourages me to floss, but now that the refills have been discontinued, the price is too expensive. I LOVED this product- the flossers last about 5 days each, and my dentist has commented on how healthy my gums are now. Farewell beloved hummingbird- you will be missed."
2,Not reliable,"Much like a few other reviewers have noted, the CD player stopping being able to spin up disks after a year or two. We bought two of the previous Sony models which ended up having the same problem. Figured the new version would fix it. Apparently it's new in cosmetic design only. The very same thing happened. Unless you think of these as disposable, stay away. The radio tuner is poor as well. Neither AM or FM stations come in very well and we live right in town."
4,Put up yer Dukes...!,"Nice, direct approach to the genre of teaching video, Duke's vulnerability in from of the camera is a perfect foil for her strength of character at the poker table. Concise, witty and fun, the video is full of gems that I believe will help me relieve the donkeys of their hard-earned money..!"
5,This is the Real Deal!,"I have watched a lot of poker DVD's and this is by far the best I've seen! Annie goes into great depth in explaining advanced strategy that you just don't get in other DVD's. If you are an absolute beginner, then I don't suggest this DVD. You should get Annie's Begginner DVd which is coming out soon. I guess they decided to lead with the Advanced DVD since so many people are sick of learning the rules of Texas Hold Em. In How To Beat The Big Boys, Annie really spills the beans. I'm not going to rehash the content for you on this review. If you want it...you gotta pay for it. All I can say, It's woth ten times the price of the DVD."
3,Good for the beginner,"Not much new information, but I like Annie Duke, so it's certainly worth watching. It's always good to review the basics."
1,Not what I was expecting,The price paid for this item was way too high considering the poor quality of the product. I really feel cheated as this helmet had about the same build quality as the ones the you get from a gum ball machine.
5,Sawallisch's Schubert : Passion and style par excellence !,"These are extremely fine accounts of early Schubert, played with grace and style. As fine as his Schubert set is, Karl Bohm does not match the kind of flair offered here by Sawallisch and the Staatskapelle. Additionally, the sound of the Philips discs enhances the sense of fun and pleasure exuded by these youthful gems. One repeatedly gets the sense that this is the way Schubert should be played and enjoyed. In the overtures, Raymond Leppard does not really convey the kind of charm and spirit Sawallisch does in the symphonies. It might also be that the London Philharmonic does not have this music in their blood the way the Staatskapelle does. Sawallisch easily gets five stars. Leppard, if rated separately, would get three. Bravo the Sawallisch/Staatskapelle Schubert !"
1,Nothing about this bra justifies the price,"I'm full figured and have tried for years to find a comfortable and supportive bra. I saw the Enell sports bra and read some of the reviews and even though the price made me swallow hard, I decided to try it. I was hoping to find something that was supportive and comfortable. I was so disappointed when I tried it on. If you call being mashed flat, it's supportive. Comfortable...not after you hook it up. I loved the fabric and the way it fits across the back, but there just isn't enough room in the front. Pass on this if you wear a DD or bigger like I do."
5,love it,"I love my new sports bra! I fits perfectly and is so comfortable and it is good to run in it, no bouncing and it is very good for the back."
1,NO MORE COMPILATIONS PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"ARE THERE THAT MANY SUPER FANS OUT THERE????? THEIR NEXT CD WILL BE ENTITLED: KANSAS COMPILATION IN 3D,REMASTERED, DOLBY, SURROUND SOUND, GOLD DISC VERSION. BUNCH OF BUFFALO CHIPS."
3,Not enough,"This compilation has remastered versions of several great songs that aren't available on remasters of the full albums. In particular, Death of Mother Nature Suite and the three songs from Monolith. But, as other reviewers have mentioned, there are several of the band's best songs left off of this. Icarus? Miracles Out of Nowhere? And let's face it, nobody cares about the songs from when Walsh wasn't in the band. If you want to get the best of Kansas, skip this and buy the remasters of Masque, Leftoverture, and Point of Know Return."
5,Raw emotions and vivid imagery that seem to go on forever,"Having never lived anywhere near Kansas, I unfortunately have had next to no exposure to their unique take on rock. (And if I may state the obvious, the one sappy, glurgy number they did, Dust In The Wind, does not do them any justice at all.)What can I say, really? It's big and bold and evocative, it's great driving music and great for lying on the couch and pondering the mysteries of life. A lot of the songs run long, but never become repetitive or tedious. I've listened to the entire collection at least five times over, and it's still as fresh as ever.And it's not all violins and extended guitar solos. There's plenty of the good 'ol fashioned mainstream here, such as Fight Fire With Fire, People of the South Wind, and Portrait.Quite possibly the only Kansas compilation you ever need. But I'll defer to their fans on *that* subject..."
4,Comprehensive Detailed Motor Control Text,Very competently written text that covers all areas of traditional motor control. The author demonstrates his field knowledge by including typical characteristics of device failure and indications where inspection and possible maintenance would be prudent. Circuits and schematics are shown in standard ladder logic convention and in some instances even shows analogy to digital logic for those who are formerly trained electronics technicians.My one criticism is the sequencing of some of the chapters. The author seems to have weaved in and out of some areas where I expected more complete coverage only to find the topics further toward the back of the text. This detracts from an otherwise well written and authoritative text for the 1st time and intermediate level learner.
4,Children love it!,Our twin girls love this book. We got one for each of them for Christmas so they could enjoy mass more. They love understanding what is going on!
4,Pretty Good,This is a really cute book that explains the mass very well. I was only a little disappointed that it wasn't more step by step through the mass. I enjoy reading it to my kids before Mass but it is not a follow along with the mass kind of book. I am still looking for a great one of those. I had one when I was a little girl and it is falling apart so I can't give it to three kids to read during church.
3,Good Read,The book was a good read but should have developed the growing love between the hero and heroine. There seemed to be a lot of time spent arguing. I didn't feel that the characters knew enough about each other to truly have a strong bond.
5,Very Cuddly Bear,"My son gave this to his girlfriend as a gift. It is adorable and quite large. It is a well-made, super soft and extremely cuddly bear. My son's girlfriend loved it!"
4,Must be a great teacher!,"Without even knowing who he is, you can tell Mr. Flannery must be an excellent teacher from the way he writes an ecological history of North America that starts with the demise of the dinosaurs. If you're into history, science, and story telling, this is a great read from a Harvard professor."
2,No new *BLEEP* here...,"I rented this video some time back to see what the fuss was all about. After watching it, I was rather disappointed. Except for all the colorful unbleeped language and uncensored buttocks and mammaries (some of the ugliest ones I've ever witnessed on video), just about everything on this video had already been shown on the TV show! There was next to no new material.There was one moment of the rare new footage that I found rather memorable, however. Two police cars collide at an intersection while driving to the same crime scene. Both cars had COPS camera crews riding in them, with film rolling the whole time. When I saw the footage of the collision from the passenger-seat point-of-view, I could actually feel the impact.I guess it really IS reality television!'Late..."
3,dvd,"I love Mark Twain but this got to be a bit tiresome to watch. for 1-1/2 presentation, it seemed longer. Hal Holbrook did a great job, but an hour could have made this more interesting."
2,DVD Mark Twain Tonight,"Disappointing. Mr.Holbrook is a great actor, but most of the disk almost put me to sleep. If Mr. Twain was as portray, I guess the folks were even more laid back than me. I am not a SNL fan or reality show fan, thus the presentations do not always have to be fast-paced or overly silly. I like good stand up and comedy in general.Yes I realize that this was a portal/interpretation of Mr Twain Samuel Clemens], but the comedy was lacking. I have read his works [i.e. Mark Twain] and generally really enjoyed them.Wish I could return it."
5,Twain and Holbrook what a team,Hal makes Sam come alive in the presentation that is a must for anyone who wishes to hear Mark Twain's voice as you read his classic writings.for many today the humor of the written word of Twain is missed or underappreciated.Hal Holbrook hammers your funny bone.
1,"Disappointing new arrangements; voice OK, no longer great.","This CD looked promising from the label, but was so disappointing I returned it. Andrews' original performances of many of these standards, such as those from My Fair Lady, were absolutely gorgeous. For some inexplicable reason, in an effort to ""improve"" on these standards, the arrangements have been all mangled. They contain unexpected modulations and other strange changes which make the listener want to grab the original recording-which is what I did for My Fair Lady. Julie Andrews' original recordings of many of these songs were sublime. Unfortunately, these retakes remind us that her voice isn't what it once was, as she too often talks her way through the songs and avoids the jumps and high notes that she used to hit in clear, thrilling fashion."
5,Two toned wooden checker board chips,"If you are looking for undyed, pure wood checker chips, these are great! We already had a two-toned wood checker board and have been looking for chips for some time. They are large sized and made beautifully."
4,This product is even more amazing than I imagined!!,"I have only had my Ipod for 3 days but I know that every other product on the market is a step backward. The most important qualities are the ease of operation in downloading music and audiobooks (why I bought it!), the compact size and sleek design (it feels good in your hand). Last but definitely not least, you have no idea how large 15 gb is!! I am so excited to have this product, which I will use constantly. Contary to what I may have thought before, this is one ""gadget"" that is definitely worth the price. I have many...I know! Try it. You won't regret the investment. AB, Springfield,Ma"
1,No USB cable - Why?,"I brought an Ipod for a friend's birthday and to my horror, when they opened the box and tried to use it, it had no USB cable. That is the dumbest thing I have ever seen. It says its compatible with PCs and it doesn't come with a USB cable? What percentage of PCs have firewire cables, 1%? I think this is a real sleazy way of trying to save a buck for a company I use to respect. At least when you buy a toy for a kid, it tells you Batteries not included, so you can buy batteries ahead of time to avoid the disappointment of not being able to play with it right away."
2,Dell Jukebox is better,I recommend people to take a look at the Dell Jukebox.Which features:- CHEAP!! $199 -- 15GB-20hr battery life vs. 8 max with the iPod.-A 15GB capacity which holds more than the iPod-Support for Windows Media Files (.wma)-A jog-wheel like on your mouse vs. a hard to use wheel (iPod)-A pretty blue backlightYou will see that the Dell is a MUCH better deal.
1,wow wat a load of crap,"attention if u own a even remotely semi old pc never get the i-pod, ive bin through 2 weeks of non-stop computer work to get this i-pod running and my comp is only a year old! i got it running for a day, it was the day after x-mas, then the next day i plug it into my computer and it just doesnt read. so i bought a USB 2.0 card wich in no way helped then i tried all the following instructions that MAC instructed me to and i got nothing. worst 2 weeks of my life, got so frustrated i serously wanted to have someone pitch it to me and me hit it with a bat then take a axe and chop up the rest. never ever ever ever ever buy this product with a pc at home. you have bin warned, dont waste ur money"
1,"Somewhat dry and odd performance, I did not like it at all","I do not like this performance at all. It's dry, there isn't much energy or passion. There is a sort of crispness to the playing...things are cut too short. Tempos are odd. The emphasis is wrong. It just doesn't feel right.I tend to be tolerant of perverse performances such as Glenn Gould...but at least Gould has energy, intensity, flow. This...is just annoying to listen to. I'd choose any mediocre pianist playing the WTC in a ""normal"" way over this strange and unpleasant performance. Get a different CD of the WTC, not this one."
2,Dog as Babysitter?,"I guess I just didn't get this book but I really didn't like it. The whole premise is that a Mother gets a break from caring for her baby by turning the young baby over to a dog. My young sons looked at me and said, ""Mom why did that Mom leave her baby all alone with a dog?"" I said, ""I said it's just a story but it's kind of a strange story for kids. Some people think that animals are just like people. They don't realize that an animal has animal instincts, and may act on those instincts by biting."" I like dogs myself, but young children need to be taught to be careful around animals. They have been known to bite!"
4,"A disturbing, thought-provoking book.","A baby is abandoned in a city park by a young, single mother to be cared for by two Rotweillers. The threesome manage to keep themselves alive by scrounging for food from strangers, narrowly escaping injury from the park amusements and maintenance equipment. The mother eventually comes to her senses and returns to pick up her baby before Social Services arrest her.I'm not sure which is more disturbing, the unapologetic ease at which the mother can decide to leave her child, or the detached non-involvement of the other park visitors, who never once called the police or child welfare officials to pick up the baby.This book should be treated as a cautionary tail to educate parents-to-be about the responsibilities of parenthood."
2,Sacrificial Lamb,"Poor Lauren, she was like a lamb led to slaughter. Shame on Ben for asking a sweet, innocent girl into the midst of his badly disfunctional family. I can't think of a worse scenario. What was going on in Jared's head to treat unknowing Lauren in such a manner. And Olivia she took the cake. How Jared let her pull his strings was mind boggling. Someone wrote that they just loved all the characters. About the only lovable ones were Elena, Rosa, Maria and Gloria. Rudy wasn't bad either, but Jared needed his tail whipped.At least all the bad guys got it in the end. What a bunch of ruthless scum."
4,"Lovely characters, good story, but a little annoying...","I've just finished this, my first Sandra Brown book. I was highly impressed with her detailed description of the characters (especially the main characters, Lauren and Jared). The story was good and the time passed quickly while I read this novel. However, the central theme (love, of course) was a little annoying. I don't want to spoil it for potential readers, but the love between Jared and Lauren (and all the problems involved) were just a little too unbelieveable for me.Overall, this is a book worth reading, if only for the interesting story line and characters."
4,Upshaw is incredible,"I was present for a performance of Ayre in New York a couple of years ago. It's a song cycle drawing on several different cultural and historical traditions -- Christian, Muslim, Jewish and of course the composer's native South America. The performance was quite exhilirating. The music is mostly tuneful and the orchstration very interesting.Still, I can't help wondering if this is the kind of music that will last. Will people still be listening to Ayre 100 years from now? I'm not sure. I hear geat talent and skill -- but do I hear genius? Again, I'm not convinced. Sometimes, I have the feeling of being manipulated. This music is very politically correct, especially the long lament for the Palestinians at the center of this work.One thing is for sure: Dawn Upshaw is sensational. She molds her voice into a supremely flexible instrument, making it do all kinds of wonderful things.I do recommend this recording. It's interesting and it asks good questions. But it's not quite great."
5,A woefully overlooked Altman masterpiece,"A woefully overlooked film, this is one of my very favorite by Altman. Amazing acting by Tim Roth and Paul Rhys, and the whole film is tremendously moving.For me, Altman achieves a sort of dream state far more interesting than in the more critically acclaimed `3 Women'. He manages to make you feel the whole story as completely real, as if you were there in history, and yet, it has a fractured, dreamlike quality, with moments left unexplained and mysterious, but always making emotional sense.I don't know any film that better captures the pain of being an artist, or the pain of being unable to save someone you love. Also, the whole film looks gloriously like a painting.There is a longer version, originally made for European TV, but I actually think the rhythms are far better in the US theatrical cut. The Euro version mostly adds tons of exposition that takes away from the mysterious, subjective tone that makes this work so well."
4,A Room of secrets,"Josh doesn't want to go to his Grandmother's house with his mother. He doesn't wasn't to spend his summer holidays away from his friends in a stuffy old house. But he has no choice, and, while his mother is busy looking after his grandmother, he has to entertain himself.The book follows two stories - the story of Josh's summer, with a new friendship and his Grandmother's illness to deal with - and the story of Josh's Uncle Patrick, whose death is a mystery Josh slowly uncovers.This is an excellent read for 12 to 15 year olds."
2,Generations Family Tree by Broderbund is a better choice.,"Family Tree Maker is an okay genealogy program. For the very novice or someone that needs an extremely simple format for inputting - this one's for you. Otherwise for beginner's and experts alike, get Generations Family Tree (now distributed by Broderbund). The charts and family group sheets are easier to use and have superior results compared to Family Tree Maker. Don't go for the ""deluxe"" versions, the extra discs of ""information"" contains very little useful data - plus the same information can be readily found on the internet. I've been using genealogy programs for the last 5 years and have tried several. It's too bad that Broderbund bought Generations (from Sierra Home software) and won't promote it - as it's a better product over their Family Tree Maker."
1,Family Tree Maker strikes out,"I don't usually like Broderbund software and once again they prove I should not have bought their software. It's easy to set up and use but every click to research a relative brings an offer to buy software that you need to get that information. $ for the software, $ for census software, $ for the files of a single state during a specific time period and I don't even know if my relative lived there. The family search name took me to family trees that didn't even have the names in them I searched on. Not one name in my family is in their CDs that contain ""over 1100 years of history"". The complaint list goes on and on. That's the very last time I buy Broderbund software. Ever!"
1,False Advertising on Box,"I purchased Broderbund Family Tree Maker because on the box it states all of the types of data I can access. That is not accurate. Once the software is installed and opened, there is no data to access, only advertising to sell access to the information at high prices. Also, no phone number to call and verify what I have encountered in case I am mistaken and there is some secret way to bypass the sales pitch."
2,Not what I expected...,"I've read Arroyo's ""Chart Interpretation Handbook"", so I picked this one up while looking for information on the elements. Unfortunately, I didn't get much from this book. I was very disappointed to find the charts and the house explanations almost reprinted word-for-word from ""Chart Interpretation."" While I appreciate the information on the elements, I didn't really learn anything. I was also disappointed that the subject of archetypes was not clearly tied to the planets, signs and houses. The author does bring a lot together in this book, but it is very general, more of a grouping of what's been stated by others, than an actual point of reference. Perhaps as my astrological studies continue this book will become more meaningful to me. I've since found much more relevant information on the four elements elsewhere."
2,Didn't work for me...,"This product did not work for me at all. I live in a metropolitan area, and I think that was the biggest problem. It needs a station that plays nothing but static, and that is hard to find in densely populated areas. It may work for you if you live in the middle of Ohio's cornfields."
2,Don't buy it,"Bad product - doesn't function when slighly warm - kind of counter-intuitive to design a product for use in the car that doesn't react well to heat, a car being a hot environment. Over all, it was a waste of money. My wife has a casette adaptor that I have hijacked, really DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT."
4,Not Bad At All,"Pros: Easy color-coded setup, easy to use, headphone jack, multiple speaker setup options, decent sound quality, surprisingly good subwoofer with its own on/off switch.Cons: Weak inputs (maxxed out at 50, digital coax sound volume from our DVD player in a medium sized room was very good and definitely loud enough but left no reserve), hardwired speakers.We settled on a 3.1 setup where Surround Sound outputs are routed to the front left/right speakers and didn't use rear speakers at all (We don't really want/need full 5.1, however, to get the speaker separation we wanted in the front we used the rear speakers with their longer wires). This works well for our needs and had there been more volume reserve and speakers that weren't hardwired then I would have given this unit 4.5/5 stars."
2,Didn't Last Long,"It seemed nice while it lasted, which was about 4 months. This unit runs very hot and I even had fans on it. One day it just had too much and quit on me.Pros: Lots of inputs, looks nice, decent sound.Cons: Subwoofer came with a vibration, probably bad seal. I bought mine recertified, so this may also be why. Not very loud, had to turn up to 45/50 to get decent volume.Other Comments: This was my first Surround Sound System with a Receiver. I have upgraded to a Pioneer VSX-D812 which blows the RCA way out of the water. If you're looking for something cheap to put in a small room and not use alot of power or much noise the RCA is fine. If you're looking for a decent Surround Sound System, look elsewhere."
1,terrible system,I wanted a powerful thousand watt system to replace my 350 watt system that was getting old and did not have the inputs that i would like now that I have an hdtv. This system has all the inputs and outputs necessary for home theater it really lacks in sound quality. There is no hard thumping realistic bass. My old system had a 100 hundred watt sub the sounded so much better. When watching a movie with gunshots and special effects I would say that this system will leave you unsatisfied.
2,1000????watt I dont think so,I was impressed by the reviews and purchased this product. In my 10 X 18 media room you have to crank it up to 45 ( 50 being max vol) and that is via the digital coaxial connector!! I replaced the front speakers with my Bose 201's and it helped a little but I will replace this asap. Great for a childs room. New progressive digital dvd player is connected to the system.
2,aspiring philosophers,"This film was a dissapointment to me. It really took something away from my love of techno.I tired of watching/listening to ""artist"" after ""artist"" try to wax philosophical, to floor me by saying something deep and profound.Much ado about nothing."
2,"Should have been subtitled ""What Raving Means to Me""","Disorganized, self-indulgent foray into the world and music of rave culture. Buy it to hear partykids and scenesters wax poetic about a rave scene that no longer exists (as it's shown here), but not for a history of electronic music. I'd recommend Better Living through Circuitry over this one."
4,"If you like to listen to boys talk, this is for you.","Touted as the definitive work on electronica, the guys start talking and never stop. Though many interesting observations about the genre from its origins in disco to the influence of diverse races and cultures are effectively made, some questions receive scant attention. For example, while there is an interesting scene which shows how the equipment itself is made by women, every performer interviewed, spoken of, or filmed is male which makes one wonder what that might be all about?"
5,exceptional travel mug,Best travel mug we've ever purchased. It does not leak and is easy to clean and store. The leather design cover adds some class so it is easy to bring to office meetings or have out on my desk. Definately worth the money.
3,"OK, but disappointed.","After reading the other reviews on this product, I decided to order it. I LOVE black licorice. While the product is better than the Twizzlers licorice I buy for $1 per pound (when it is on sale), it just can't compare to the Australian Darrell Lea black licorice, which has a richer flavor and texture and is a much better buy for me."
2,Psycho-babble,"Aside from Oscar Lewis, I have a hard time finding a social anthropologist I like. This one I don't care for. This author is heavily influenced by Freud, and we get lots of psychobabble. You'll like this book if you like lines like this: ""On that Friday he engaged in an orgy of schismogenesis. He had been drinking since early morning. The alcoholic's drinking, argues Bateson, is often a symetrically schismogenic act...."""
2,"An unlikely ""sisterhood"" of stereotypes.","I was so hopeful when I picked this book and was initially pleased settling into the story line. All the women were about my age and I have faced some of the changes they faced in the story. Ms. Monroe's characters share their deep losses and challenges on such an intimate level with the reader, but for all the empathy inspired by their revelations when Monroe started folding the characters together, things seemed to fall apart. The mature, vibrant women I met in the beginning of the story became emotionally limited numbskulls as the story moved along.Good start, sloppy finish (quickly wrapped up and tied with a big, pink bow, and only a few loose ends)."
2,Predictable,Trying to come up with a memorable moment for this book .. and can't. Forgettable .. Characters seem dated and plot seems like an 80's made for TV movie.
3,"Good workout, but...",Like the short workouts..but it's way to expensive for what you get. You only get ONE dvd of a few workouts. I didn't think it was worth the price.
3,"Semi-decent bio,if slightly exploitive","Sal Mineo finally has a bio about him. And the results are mixed! Although the book contains many insightful information,it also has a tendancy to keep centering on Sal's sexual exploits,sometimes over-shadowing other important issues. Also, Jeffers seems obsessed with reminding the reader he had sexual relations with Mineo. If this is true,it didn't appear the two of them had anything more than a few one nighters. But if telling readers he had sex with Sal boasts his little ego,let him get his 15 minutes of fame,at Sal's expence.I just hope,somebody ELSE write a bio on Sal,that doesn't STOOP LOW to EXPLOIT SEX,just for the sake of selling more books,and writes a more detailed portrait of Sal Mineo,that includes ALL aspects of Sal's life. Jeffers seems to be ""in love"" with Mineo,and should realize he was just a one-night stand,and get over his ego."
3,all we have so far,"Unfortunately not much has been written about Sal Mineo. This book is an attempt to be a comprehensive look at Mineo's life. While informative in parts of the book, the author seems self serving when he states that he had sex with Mineo. The book is very focused on Mineo's homosexuality and does not focus very much on his film/play work. The book is poorly written for the most part and Mineo may have been better served by a neutral author. I don't know if another book will be written about Sal Mineo but I would venture a guess and say that he deserves better than this one."
5,Garrity LED Flashlight,"This is a great flashlight! What a wonderful gift it makes. It's small enough to carry in your pocket or your purse. And it's so bright - really bright. I've given several of these as gifts and notice that my friends seem to be using them frequently.I looked and looked in the grocery store, hardware store, drug store, etc, and could not find any at all. They come in all colors, my favorite is red, but my husband likes the yellow one, also come in black, and perhaps other colors. So I thought I'd check on Amazon.com and sure enough! there it was - and at an excellent price. I bought three and saved on shipping costs."
3,"Lots of info, not a lot of pictures","Very informative but I was disappointed in how few pictures and diagrams there were. Words can only convey so much, would be a fantastic book if the next edition include color photographs. Rather expensive for the size, it's a pretty thin book. I've bought horse related medical books that are 10X the size for less $$.If you are into medical terminology and procedures it's great, if you are a casual reader and/or prefer many pictures save your money."
2,pixel loss,"Nice product, enjoyed using it as the others here have, but after a couple of years, some of the pixels are not working anymore and it is getting very difficult to read. A pity, as I really liked the product. Getting it repaired or whatever is just not worth it. New batteries and resetting it have not helped."
2,"Poor quality recording, mediocre tunes","I am a fan of Hot Hot Heat, Knock Knock Knock remains unrivaled. I had never heard of The Red Light Sting. The Split CD is a great idea and would have worked if not for two things. The first being poor recording quality (not glorious Lo Tech recording like The Black Keys or White Stripes, just bad). The second is Hot Hot Heat's pathetic showing. The Red Light Sting outshine them with their half of the album, yet I have been unable to find a CD of them on their own. Given the chance, could they run circles around the Heat like they did on Split?"
5,A great start to a great series. Read it.,"READ THIS BOOK if you like any sci-fi or humor. If you liked Hitchhikers,read this. If you didn't like Hitchhikers, what's wrong with you?Read this anyway.Also: Check out the <a href=""http://www.cathouse.org/BritishComedy/alt.tv.red-dwarf/"" Cathouse alt.tv.red-dwarf pages>"
1,Huh?,"Word of mouth and all the 5-star reviews of this book had me very excited to read this series but... it just wasn't that funny. Nowhere close to Pratchett or Adams, who I find hysterical. The ending was quite depressing. I kept waiting for it to improve (or get funny) on the next page, and it did when I finally finished..."
2,"5 Stars for content, -1 Star for quality of code","Not recommended for MCSD or MCAD 70-310 exam preparation!Conceptually, the book covers all of the bases that an aspiring XML developer would require, including somewhat thorough concept, explanation, example, and summary investigations.Where the book greatly lacks is the code samples; many will not run, and multiple programming languages are introduced.Don't buy this book for study."
3,Reasonably Amusing,Imagine a rich spoiled young man that decides since none of his family or co-workers have invited him for Christmas he will buy it from a family. Affleck plays the spoiled young man reasonably well and the casting of the family is decent. He offers them a quarter of a million to let him stay with them over the week of Christmas. At first things are very strained as he makes all kinds of demands for food and favors but the money makes them grin and bare it. With time an understanding is reached and the family is not quite as dysfunctional.
4,A GOOD MOVIE,I thought this movie was a pretty good movie. Ben Affleck did a wonderful job playing Drew. I definately recommend this movie to anyone.
2,Annoying Read,This book was very difficult to read from the beginning. I also do not appreciate having religion shoved down my throat which this book likes to do. Ignoring that part of it and skipping around made parts of the book bearable.
1,Misinterpretation of Satie's music,"The poetry, subtle energy and elasticity of Satie's music is entirely lost in De Leeuw's interpretations. The pieces are drawn out to an extent where each note becomes a fragment that does not add up to a whole. The music of Satie thus becomes as unengaging as elevator music.Eric Satie was a restless and discontented innovator who barely had finished with one musical style until he moved on to the next. This tireless energy can be found in other recordings of Satie's music - most notably by Anne Queffelec - where even the most famous of Satie's composition, the slow Gymnopedies 1-3, reflect Satie's dynamic persona.In order to profoundly understand music and see it from the inside, it is necessary for the interpretor to understand its composer. This is not the case with De Leeuw."
4,You're Both Correct!,"Those who love and detest these unique renderings are both, in a sense, correct. Just because an interpretation deviates from what we expect it to sound like doesn't make it wrong. Necessarily. Sure, excessive interpretive freedom can wreck the enjoyment of an otherwise fine piece of music. Witness Ivo Pogorelich's nonsensically detached, self-indulgent performances of Rachmaninov's 3rd Piano Concerto that he toured with a few years ago. Ultimately, though, either it ""works"" or doesn't, a purely subjective determination. Robert de Leuw's rendering (or rending, as the case may be) can be experienced either as pure bliss or torture. I err on the side of the former, but appreciate the contrary view."
2,Very disappointing.,"The sound quality of this recording was very disappointing. It sounds as if it had been recorded in a cave. I chose this disc for the Gymnopedies, which I love, but I found the tempo glacial. You could almost lose the thread of the melody from one note to the next."
5,Great book,This book was practically brand new. There were no tares or pages missing and it coincided well with the course. This book was also an easy read considering the topic. Great product.
4,Best I've found...,"For organic mac 'n cheese, this is the best so far. Could be a bit cheesier or flavorful though. Package size is perfect for this family of four (2 adults, 2 teen boys) and I make it as a side dish with a meat and usually broccoli, which complements it well. To perk it up, I sometimes cook as directed then bake in over with a little shredded cheese and bread crumbs on top. Yum."
3,Fred: The Movie,"Honestly, I really don't like this movie, it's annoying. But my kids love it, it is recorded on every DVR in our house. I bought this for a birthday present for my youngest son, he absolutely loves this movie."
1,"really, really awful kid's movie (parents viewpoint)","There are some movies that can be enjoyed by both adults & kid's. This is not one of them. Watched this movie with my wife & son. My wife left the room partway through the movie. This movie has no plot and was not funny. The main character Fred is highly annoying. Kid's may like it, but what's the point when there are plenty of better things to watch. The writer of this film should tarred and feathered."
2,Hasn't worked for me,"This product may have worked for other people, but it has not worked for me. After 45 days of use, I have not seen a difference in my weight or energy. I was really hopeful that this would be of great benefit, but at this point, I cannot say it has worked. During that time, I continued with my daily workout routine and diet. I also combined it with Forskolin."
1,Doesn't work!,This product doesn't work at all. I purchased it after seeing it promoted on Dr. Oz. He said it increases metabolism but it has done nothing for mine. I took it twice a day as recommended. My metabolism is still at a standstill.
4,Recommended,Both informative and fun! Does contain a serious typo on p.299 though: Jimi Hendrix is spelled as Jimmy Hendrix!
1,Confusing Book,I tried to read this book twice but gave up after the first few pages. All the pictures overwhelmed me - picture overload. I think about reading it at night but fear that the pictures would haunt me in my dreams.
3,"""Speaking"", but not clearly","This was originally purchased for a friend & I also bought the same product later. She said it didn't convey the words accurately, but seemed much better when she used the earphones. I don't find the earphones to be of much help. She & her husband have a purpose in learning Spanish so they are also using other tools. She has grown more pleased with it as she becomes familiar with it. I would say from our experience probably not the best tool for clarity of sound, but useful considering the price. We do like the ""clean"" speech of Merriam-Webster."
2,"Great concept, poor functionality","I love the possibilities an electronic dictionary offers but the mechanics of this one has a lot of problems. The screen does not have enought contrast no matter how you adjust it. If you use the backlight it shuts off, in fact it shuts off on its own all the time. Very frustrating. Whenever it shuts off unexpectedly you also loose all of your preferences (like large type). The voice part is really not worth the extra money. The pronunciations are so digitized it does not help much. It is extremely convenient to have an electronic translator in your pocket, just not this one."
2,VERY hard to read,"I bought the 1850 based on the glowing reviews I read here, and frankly, I'm disappointed. I'd spent a number of hours searching for something like this, and this seemed to be the best available. If so, I'd hate to see the others.The word lookup features seem to work pretty well, and I'm going to try to use it on my trip to Mexico, but I find the screen barely legible, even with the backlighting, and the speech is worthless.There is a data cable you can run to your PC, but since this seems to be largely for reading eBooks you can download from Franklin, and I cannot possibly imagine trying to read a book on this screen, it's useless. Mine did not come with an AC adaptor, and a couple of mine I tried didn't work.I think the glowing reviews here are highly misleading."
2,For basic daily use,"I am studying to be court interperter & I need to learn as many words as posible, both in English & Spanish. This doesn't have a good definision for each language, it just translates."
2,Dissenting view,"I'm the dissenting review here. For me, the screen contrast is extremely poor, so bad that I don't find the dictionary worth using. I'm very disappointed because the other reviews were very positive and I like all of the benefits of quick, electronic access.Also, WARNING: My dictionary was provided through WorldWide Distributors in Tarzana, CA. It came with an invoice and contact information. I tried to contact WorldWide at their 800 number several times to find out how to return it, but no one answers the phone. I also sent an email five days ago, and no one has responded. Looks like I'm out $80 and no way to recover it."
4,great little dictionary with speaking ability for students or parents,"In translate from English to Spanish and vice versa. you want to add more you have to buy cards but its up to you if you want to expend your library. My parents used it even now. the light in the screen is a bit dim so plug to the wall and it should be ok to read. Not sure if it came with a ac/dc adapter. Good product to have for intermediate students. fast delivery when it was shipped it too about 4 days and than after that it took 2 more days to get here, so it was a fast delivery.Don't forget to increase the brightness and use good batteries"
2,Underrealized Expectations,"This is not much more than a dictionary with a difficult to read screen. I think I expected more of a ""Babblefish"" type translation device where I could input a phrase I needed to speak. This device only allows single word input. The ""phrases"" described in the marketing refers to pre-set common phrases, and is very poorly organized with no search capabilities outside of major categories. It would be good in emergencies (such as when you go blank trying to remember a specific word), but unfortunately its too big to slide into a pocket."
2,review,Very poor product. You often get examples whih have nothing to do with the original word and do not get a concise translation.
4,Fast shipping,"Received item as described, but it only worked for 2 weeks.I do not know why it stopped working.Fast delivery and great packaging."
2,Not what I thought,"The image is very very hard to see, I thought it was poor batteries, but I've tried every kind and still the only way to get a decent image of the screen is to use the dim option, which of course drains more battery. The options on the bottom of the screen are hard to figure out how to access. It translates the words we need and the phrases are pretty useful, though very basic. Not worth the selling price though, I'd pay 20-30$ for a device like this. My advice....keep researching and try them out in person before buying online if possible."
4,Funny,"I enjoyed watching Hood Boogas, The Movie. It's funny. I watched it twice. It could be a longer. I will be looking forward to your other movies Rock. Keep up the good work."
2,"Nice detail, too fragile for the shipping","First this item is not 15 pieces, most of the pieces are attached to the base. So it really is only 5 or 6 individual pieces. Also, I didn't find the music to be very graceful. That said, it is nicely detailed.The problem is the outer pieces are attached only by their two legs and very fragile. Upon opening the package, I found the woodsman broken off from the base.I requested a replacement, and one was shipped immediately. Unfortunately the replacement is even more damaged than the first one, as several large pieces of the base were found to be broken upon opening.It seems that the packaging is not sufficient to handle the shipping of this item."
5,Cute sample sized set,"L'Occitane sells top of the line Shea Butter based products that are usually quite expensive. This set is adorable and is a bargain for the products you get. The bag they come in is really nice and while it is masculine appearing, it is big enough to function well as a cosmetic case. The sample sizes are perfect to put in a purse or would work for a one or two day trip but are too small for more than that. I was so pleased with this set, I bought a second one to give as a (male) gift."
4,~They don't make you feel jittery~,"I don't use them very often, only for the days that I cannot drag myself out of bed, but they are also useful if I need energy all day long....and believe me, these last ALL DAY LONG!"
2,Over rated,"This book is over rated, the 7 present reviews give 5/5 stars, that just not true, it is a nice book, with lots of information, but maybe to technical, not enough background, and definitely not a starter book. If you are curious on sword and history, they are other better books, but if you in deep in Samurai sword's and want reference info, this is a good book. But things like ""beginner book?!?"" I don't think so.Also the price for what you get, there is like 180 pages, but 100 of them are hand drawing (not all that great), and of that 60 pages are of Japanese characters translated in English (again for a beginner, completely useless). Look for something more complete with wider range before blowing 30 $ on that."
3,it's ok,"old copyright version, missing updates to text. Not useful for practitioners or as required reading for class. That's all folks."
4,smoother text,"There's 2 areas which could be improved. Upon starting the clear button needs to be activated to stop a scrolling message. Would be nice to be able to use it without this step. The other area is the large size text is great but the letters are somewhat block like. Smoothing of letters would be better. So far, the solver does its job well."
2,Franklin CWP-206 Puzzle Solver - Recourse for a replacement?,"The Crossword Puzzle Solver that I bought this time was a replacement for the same one I bought from Amazon. The first one didn't last very long! Vertical strokes started to appear and it got worse. Eventually, I had to buy another one. In other words, so far it cost me twice the price of one. There was no recourse!!!"
3,Review something I wish I never have to use,If and when I get to use it I will know if it was a good investment.
1,not supplement to warranty,"BE AWARE, this product doesn't kick in until manufacturer warranty expires. It doesn't serve as supplemental insurance. Getting any assistance is impossilble."
1,2-year replacement plan for navigan 7200t gps unit,"I bougt this item on 5/5/09 and paid the amount,but so for I have not received any materials about the warranty! Please look in to this matter and send me the necessary warranty. Thank you; SRREDDYMD,203 BRISTOL COURT,FLORENCE,AL 35630."
3,Murder where?,"My major complaint about this book is the title. None of the events takes place within a museum; the museum is a structure that has been designed and anticipated, but has not been constructed within the time framework of the story. I'm sorry to be so picky, but why do authors or publishers do this sort of thing? It seems totally unnecessary. Book was all right, although Carol is anything but an appealing main character."
3,Nicely Laid Out,"The beginning and the course taken for the mystery to unfold are quite ordinary for a murder case although at times, especially in the beginning, it is a tad slow moving. Mr. Brett's humor is quite subtle but utterly dry once in a while and these are duly depicted in each character and happening. Once the killer is acknowledged, each loose end is concluded rapidly. The main female characters (Carole and Jude) couldn't be more different than each other yet they are friends in solving crimes. Relationship seems to be the main agenda in the story. The true villain is not hard to perceive. It is an entertaining mystery yet it lacks any real suspense."
1,I want Charles Paris back!,"I have read all the Charles Paris and Mrs. Pargeter books in hardcover. I loved them all and looked forward to the latest series. I find it hard to believe they are written by the same author. The main characters are shallow and, in the case of one, mean spirited and jealous. The other, Jude, is just strange. I find no suspense; maybe because I don't care what happens to these two sad and unfulfilled women. After buying the first couple in hardcover I purchased next in paperback. I don't think I will buy another."
2,state songs,"I bought this item for my son for christmas.It arrived on time,but I'mnot sure what condition it was in because my son didn't open it until thenbut the plastic sleave that it came in was damaged.Also the record wouldn't play on his turntable.So it was pretty much a useless gift."
4,Stodgy State Songs Get A Makeover,"This is a fun compilation of wacky and mostly meaningless songs--but isn't that what one expects from one of the members of They Might Be Giants? My six-year old loves it. It probably helps that our state is chosen as one of the ""sixteen fifty state songs"" as he puts it. If you like TMBG, this will fit in nicely with what you want to hear. I have to admit, these songs are a little weird. I imagine the composer up late at night working them out and there's a sort of pathos that emerges, but I enjoy them (the songs, that is), so I must be a little weird, too. If you consider yourself in this category, then this album(what do you call a compilation of songs these days?) is for you."
3,What did I expect from Linnell?,"I guess I bought State Songs expecting more of the Flansburg funky sound that I've grown to love with Factory Showroom and Mono Puff, Flansburg's side-project. If you like the older, sillier, less melodic tunes of the early days of TMBG, you'll probably like State Songs, but if you're more into the funkier new material, go for John Flansburg's Mono Puff."
4,Don't listen to that Bruce Richardson guy.,"He obviously knows nothing about music. First of all, who buys a CD without knowing what it is? ""Oh wow! These must be the real state songs recorded by John Linnell of They Might Be Giants. I don't like They Might Be Giants so I think I'll buy this album!""--(not an actual Bruce Richardson quote)This album is really great if you're looking for something a little different from top 40 sludge. It drags in a few places but overall it is very worthwhile. John Linnell is an amazingly gifted and original songwriter. Bruce Richardson on the other hand, is not."
4,"I'm not gonna say they're great, I ain't gonna say they ain't.","This was They Might Be Giants' John Linnell's first(and so far only) solo album. The songs are all named after one of the US states (other than ""The Songs of the 50 States""). The songs, which include a few instrumentals, are not really ""about"" the states. They are more like They Might Be Giants songs than anything else, not surprisingly. In fact, this pretty much sounds like a They Might Be Giants album minus John Flansburgh, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. Fans of TMBG should enjoy it. One peculiar thing I should mention is that the album ends with over seven minutes of a recording of a parade passing by the window of the recording studio."
3,A scooby snack,"In the intro to this book Slater says he got lots of mail from people saying 'this book is about my childhood'. Well, duh, of course it is. Anyone who is British (as I am) and is under 45 will have savoured exactly the same brands of chocolate, tea, pies etc etc and will have experienced the class snobbery and general coldness of the upper middle classes that were Slater's parents.It is a pleasant enough read, showing how food replaced affection in Slater's lonely childhood. But in the end it leaves you wanting more. He doesn't talk about his feelings properly and skims over stuff about his sexuality. In the end you are left with a hunger, to know more about this boy. Ultimately unsatisfying."
2,Very limited use,"The book covers 15 professional fields: Advertising, Architecture, Clergy, Legal, Dentistry, Education, Firefighting, Journalism, Law Enforcement, Life Sciences, Modeling, Moviemaking, Politics, and the Sex Industry. Within each topic are some job descriptions, a bit of day-in-the-life, education, and salary. It's a pretty broad brush that might be okay for a short story or for a minor character, but there's nowhere near enough information for a fully-fleshed character in a novel-length work.Personally, I would recommend looking in the Career/Job Search section of your library or bookstore, and at the government's Occupational Outlook Handbook. Information in these resources is often more detailed - career paths, personality traits, day-to-day tasks, etc.Generally, I like Raymond Obstfeld's books, but this one just wasn't one of them."
4,Convenient resource,"There's not much in this book that a person can't also research on her own, but that's exactly the point of it: this time-consuming work has already been done and the results brought together between two covers. The result is a convenient resource and tool for inspiration for writers who need more depth for contemporary characters."
4,Organized Chaos,"I just saw Skeleton Key live w/ The Melvins and Tomahawk and they easily held their ground with those two great bands. This is a brillant album by one of the most underated bands in existence. Deep, heavy bass...guitars that scream and howl and a percussion section that attacks like it's life is depending upon each song. If you like Tomahawk, Fantomas, etc, you need buy this."
1,One Reeaally Basic Book,"Having installed the new Mac OSX and finding it somewhat more complex than previous systems, I wanted a basic book to explain its workings. This book was the first to hit the stores, and promised to start with the basics of the new OS. And it does, in spades. It tells you how to click the mouse, and (I'm not making this up) that the little keys on the keyboard are for entering data. Halfway through the book, it's revealed that the new components in OSX will be discussed in the sequel, ""OSX Visual Quickstart Pro"" or some such. If you've never seen a computer before in your life, by all means buy this book...."
4,Very Inspirational!,"As a 20-year knitting veteran, I have been starved for new knitting material for about a decade now! I was introduced to this book by one of my knitting students, and it is perhaps the best knitting book purchase I have made...ever!To read the inspiration behind the Prayer Shawl, and to actually experience the vision behind who would receive my first shawl...truly divine intervention! These ladies did an awesome job with this book, and have given me a new way to share my talents with other knitters and potential knitters, as well as a place to share all of our talents in the gift when these shawls are complete. My heartfelt thanks to these two great authors for sharing this inspirational book!!"
5,good performance,"easy to install and easy to use. sorry not too many words, it works, it is very easy to program."
5,Bach Organ Works - Helmut Walcha,"I never thought I would like Bach's organ works as they can be dense and daunting. However, if you can get onto Bach's wavelength, he can transport you to an electric cosmos of beauty and enlightenment. I was given a collection of Bach organ LPs by Helmut Walcha some time ago. My friend said that Germans regard Walcha as the premier interpreter of this music. He certainly knows how to play the organ and this music soars in his hands. This music is more varied than most people imagine. Some is extremely simple and delicate while some crushes your brain! I have always loved Archive recordings and these did not disappoint!"
4,Clever loser-cam comedy,"Peep show is so called because you see the world through the eyes of its two protagonists, who are an odd couple type pairing. Mark pays the rent through his thankless and uninspiring job at a credit company. Jeremy dreams of being a musician, but lacks both the talent and the ambition to go anywhere in that or any other industry.The camera is positioned to give the impression that you see through the eyes of either Jeremy or Mark, and you can hear the thoughts of whomever's eyes the camera is currently looking through. The funniest lines come as thoughts, and they will make you cringe with their bluntness and occasional (you won't want to admit) familiarity.Since this is not rated in the US, I should let you know: the show features some drug use, strong language, and sexual references. It's an adult show (in case the title left you in any doubt)."
3,Too Inconsistent to Rate Higher,"This show uses the inventive device of having the viewer hear the unexpressed thoughts and ideas of the two main characters, Mark and Jeremy. Unfortunately, the thoughts and ideas are pretty boring and tend to distract and not enhance. In addition, the unusual camera angles and moves used to express their inner thoughts make the show seem jerky and without proper pacing. There are some funny bits, but not enough to make this a ""must-see"" show. The best part of the DVD is the extra scenes that feature the characters without the inner thoughts device. In particular, Jeremy's audition tape for Big Brother is absolutely hysterical. If only the regular episodes could have been this good."
2,Irritating Characters Make This Unwatchable,"Peep Show takes a new angle on the traditional roommate comedy by allowing us to hear the lead characters inner thoughts and feelings, along with the regular dialogue. Jeremy (Robert Webb) is the slacker roommate whose main desires are to have sex as much as possible and become a pop star without actually working at it. Mark (David Mitchell) is a shy and awkward nebbish who works for a faceless corporation. As with most roommates, Jeremy and Mark alternate between liking and hating each other as they encounter the typical sit-com situations - getting a job, getting a date, etc. Hearing their inner thoughts unfortunately wears thin quickly as most of their inner thoughts consist of repeated obscenities. In fact, I believe they break George Carlin's record for the most times saying ""f***"" in a cable show. The roommates are so unlikable that they grate on you almost immediately."
3,Math game overload,"This book looked like fun by its cover, but it was too much for me. The games are pretty straightforward, although you would really need to set aside time to comb through page after page of activities. I still can't find the time, and I've owned a copy for 2 months! If you feel the need to supplement your child's math skills, knowing what gaps specific activities may fill in, I'd recommend grabbing a copy."
5,Breathtaking. Fierce. Unforgettable,These are live performances with such brilliance and vitality as to dazzle one's senses. The soloist is in full command of the music and her headlong rush and aggressive style in both pieces makes this a wonderful virtuoso disc.
4,"Great, but not the greatest","I'm sorry to contradict David Hurwitz, but Argerich's Rach 3 is NOT ""the fastest and most physically exciting you will ever hear"": this honour goes to Hurwitz's near-namesake Vladimir Horowitz in his 1941 live version with Sir John Barbirolli. In this wild rendition, Horowitz plays the concerto faster than anybody before or since, Rachmaninov and Argerich included. In fact, here Horowitz is faster than Argerich in all of the most virtuosic passages, and much faster in the end climax. Argerich - or anyone else, for that matter - simply can't equal Horowitz's white heat, whiplash kind of technical brilliance and command, his unique power, speed and tonal control."
2,little disappointed,"After seeing a video with him spinning at a club, I was very excited to get some CDs of his stuff. Unfortunately, his CDs don't portray what I heard on video. He uses a lot of vocals in his mixes and I personally can't stand vocals in trance even if it's mixed with Acid house. So there is one good song on the CD without vocals that I like."
4,"Engaging, fun, and well worth the read.............","A Suitable Boy, while not entirely engrossing, is certainly an engaging read that, despite its formidable heft, reads briskly, jaunting along at a clip that makes the pages fly by. I formed a remarkable attachment to the main characters, the formation of which is the singular achievement of this effort. A Suitable Boy contains some delightful humor, thought provoking relationships and a welcoming window into the life of an Indian family. In the end, it is, perhaps, a book that provides simply good entertainment."
4,This book should be made into a movie!,"Its taken me a long time to read this book, but it was so worth it! It was one of the most enjoyable times of my life (apart from the political factor!), the moments engrossed in the pages of the novel flew like the wind, but the memories of the characters , will stay will me for a very long time to come. It`s almost impossible to comprehend that its all fiction!!!"
1,Reading this novel is like having your teeth pulled.,"One would assume a novel of 1,474 pages would be able to tell the reader something about life in India, or even interesting details about the numerous characters. However, Vikram Seth fails miserably! I have had to force my self to finish the book, turning each page with the anticipation the next chapter would be more interesting and not so boring. I was gravely disappointed. Seth penned pages and pages of useless details; for example, Seth describes in lengthy detail a meeting between Amit Chaudry and a Spanish diplomat. However, fails draw the reader into the lives of the flat characters he has created- I could not tell you a single defining characteristic of Amit Chaudry. Seth focuses on four different families, without telling the reader any thing about them. Any interesting plot twist or scandal is buried under unnecessary detail. I would rather visit the dentist than read another novel by the same author."
4,Oh My. There is a LOT in this book!,"This is a very interesting and rich book. It reminds me of Anna Karenina--not in its characters, but in its smorgasboard of ideas and details and coverage of so many aspects of life and society. Do stick with it, and keep a dictionary handy. I occasionally did not recognize some words the Indian author took for granted. Looking them up helped a great deal."
3,Good until the end,"This well-written story is extremely accurate when it portrays events and cultural clashes in India, but it leaves something to be desired when it describes emotions and thoughts of the characters. Even Lata, the main character, seems like a distant friend, and when she makes the decision that is the focus of the novel, we don't really get to know WHY she does it.The major flaw of all novels by Indian authors that I have read is that none of them ever end the way the reader wants them to, and this one is no different. Couple that with no actual reason for her decision, and the book peters out into slightly mundane at the end.However, the beginning and middle are excellent and entertaining. This book is guaranteed to keep your attention and it provides insight into Indian culture (specifically, Bengali and east Indian culture).But don't waste your money for what is a rather unsatisfying story at the end...check it out from the library or borrow it."
4,Big book - a good read,"A Suitable Boy, set in India of 1950s, is about finding a good boy for the central character of this book - Lata Mehra. In doing so, Vikram Seth - the author - weaves this story around four families and how these families are inter-connected.This book also looks into the newly independent India and the environment around that time.This book begins with one marriage and ends with another. Do read to find out who Lata marries - Kabir, Amit, or Haresh.."
2,a suitable boy-what i think by holly o'farrell,"i thought a suitable boy by vikrem seth was a bit ramboling. it took me a while to get into it and even then my concentration wavered. i had been recomended to read the book by my mothers friend who thought it was wonderful. i however found it less than interesting. don't think ""oh she's only young she doesn't understand what it is about , the deeper meaning"" i am an avid reader and although i don't want to sound big headed i have read hundreds of books that are mainly written for adults. i may not have particuarly enjoyed some of them but at least i could say that it held my attention whereas 'a suitable boy' couldn't even grab it for a full 5 minutes. it was not for me."
1,Bad book,"This book has a misleading title. It briefly touches the surface of MEMS in the first two chapters. The rest of the book is theory of electric motors and control systems that you can find in any standard book. Nobody has built a MEMS motor yet and when that happens, the principles will be totally different as those used by the standard induction motors we know today. That's why the book is bad: describes old electric motors that cannot be built with MEMS technology. This book is non sense."
3,Title track disappointment,"This was a domestic greatest hit package that was long overdue. No doubt that Sony Legacy jumped on the bandwagon since Eminem resurrected the song on his ""Like Toy Soldiers,"" but SHAME on everyone involved, not so much for using it in the CD title, but for audaciously editing the English version of the track by fading at at 4 minutes, 10 seconds and leaving the Japanese version to run in all the song's original glory. Someone should be fired!"
3,Anybody else notice that...,Has anyone else notice that the song titles form like a sentence or a mini story.
4,Breakers' Delight,"This was pretty good. The previously mentioned fast cuts by the camera are present, but not as distracting or head ache inducing as made out to be by some. The music seems dubbed, but most of it is pretty good(old skool beats/scratching), but some of it doesn't fit in with the actual stuff going on onstage. As for the breakin', mostly amazing! Long sustained headspins, windmills, even some pop lockin'. The tape breaks down to crews showing their stuff in team segments, 2 battles between 2 teams, and a freestyle segment with individuals struttin' their stuff. You'll definitely find a crew or breaker here that you'll really like(the team from Denmark comes to mind)! Overall, very good. Buy it here as the price is comparable to most other places. The video has ads for other Manga releases too."
1,Poor Design,I had this product for less than 1 year and 1 of the speakers started to cut in and out and hum..then stopped working all together. No stereo sound then..I ended up throwing it out and I will never by another speaker product from logitech again. Have other product by logitech that work GREAT.
3,very decent,"a cool kit, but the wooden spool knitter could be a little better made. It's fine and my daughter likes it."
3,Half Hearted Greatest Hits,"This is an attempt by Epic Records to reintroduce Ty to the public, which includes 3 tracks from the aborted full album of the same name, which is available in Canada. It is unfortunate that Epic decided not to release the full ablum because it is heads above Ty's pervious release, the tepid ""Steam"" cd.As for this collection, it is incomplete. For some unknown reason, the hit ""No Mercy"" was ommited, which was the sole reason to purchase the ""Steam"" cd. In addition, the recent controversal semi hit ""Heather's Wall"" was left out. It is unfortunate that these two key songs were not included because if Epic's goal with this collection was to remind the public what Ty is capable of, then they missed the boat. ""No Mercy"" and ""Heather's Wall"" are THE two songs of Ty's that showcase him doing something different and original than the standard love song.I say skip this so called Greatest Hits and buy the import of the full album ""This Is Ty Herndon"" from Canada."
1,Horrible writing,"George Psalmanazar is a fascinating historical figure, and I encourage anyone interested to learn more about him. But do not, under any circumstances, buy this book. It is one of the worst scholarly works I've ever had the displeasure of reading. The author's prose is tortous, pedantic, and often laughable thanks to his absurdly bad metaphors. His research is not bad, but any original insights he might have gleaned are overshadowed by his wretched writing. Read the ""Pretended Asian"" by Keevak or ""The Great Formosan Impostor"" by Foley instead."
1,Definitively Lame !!!,"Basically a series of old photos, newsreel footage and interviews with veterans. The series starts off well, but quickly goes downhill and eventually becomes pure torture to watch. The fifth hour, ""Birth of the Special Forces"" consists entirely of interviews with veterans (which is OK) but uses the same 30 second soundtrack looping over and over for the entire hour! I gritted it out to the end but was left with the feeling that I had been listening to DVD ""intro music"" over and over and it couldn't be turned off. To turn the sound off would have made the speakers inaudible. Bottom line - if you like wasting money and want to be driven insane, this DVD is for you!"
5,Beautiful Collection,"This is a beautiful collection of Chopin's music. It isn't moody, and can be listened to at any time you're feeling the need for some good classical music."
2,"Good program, but...",This should be a good solution for those in my family who need phone access but would use very few monthly minutes -- but the minutes expire in unreasonably short periods. If I top up a card for $25 or $50 why should the minutes ever expire?
2,Great for my teenager-not for an adult who uses serv. a lot,"This service is perfect for my teenager. She does not need a lot of minutes and it is a way to break her into the wireless world. If she has too many minutes then she will be on the phone constantly. Her last card of $... lasted her about one month and if I needed to contact her at school, at the basketball game I can. Not great for long term due to expiring minutes."
3,"not bad, not great","I started out really liking this book, it seemed more historically accurate than The Other Boleyn Girl by Philippa Gregory in that The Last Boleyn has Mary as the older sister. I also liked that this book focused more on the love story of Mary and William Stafford.What I didn't like is that Karen Harper had Mary give birth to Henry first, then Catherine, which is not the correct order. About half-way through the book I got bored too. I was sick of reading about Mary's ""azure eyes"" and her big boobs, it got very repetitive and slow. I also didn't care for how it ended with Anne and George's deaths because Mary's life went on after that and although little is known about the last years of her life, this is historical fiction and the author could have come up with something, no?Maybe reading The Other Boleyn Girl first ruined this book for me, or perhaps it just isn't a very entertaining book."
5,A Timeless Masterpiece,"Laura Nyro was truly the 1960's link in the Tin Pan Alley songwriting tradition, tracing its roots back to the era before Gershwin. By the 60's, Broadway had become largely obsolete; jazz, once the predominant form of popular music, had taken a back seat to rock and roll; America's musical landscape was changing. There was only one artist who was able to take the influences of the jazz and Broadway traditions and fuse them with a contemporary sensibility, adding to it a compositional uniqueness that can be found nowhere else. That artist, of course, was Laura Nyro, and the album that best displays the peak of her talent is Eli & The Thirteenth Confession. No matter how many years pass, this distinct collection of songs remains fresh. Give it a listen; it just might change your life. It changed mine!"
2,There could have been so much more to this book,"I mainly purchased this book for the match conditioning section,it has the basics as far as stock bedding,gas cylinder modification,flash supressor modification.I was hoping for a section on trigger polishing after all it is a match modification.This book doesnt suggest welding front and rear lugs on the receiver not sure why that is a match conditioning procedure.You get the basics to match conditioning there just could have been more to this book.First section of the book is history its ok i guess,the rest of the book basicly copies the information you get when you buy a new springfield m1a.My opinion if your interested in the match conditioning take it to a expert armorer most of the match conditioning processes require machining tools anyway."
2,Quality is low,The keys are not functioning well after 1 year. I have to push very hard to enter the numbers. And the battery was also dead after a year.
5,Shamisen for Everybody,"So we're in the car listening to the radio when my partner says ""that's a Bulgarian folk song but its being played on a shamisen and it sounds fantastic!"" Enough to make us find out who the artist is and what other interesting things they may be up to. Now, all our friends have III by the Yoshida Brothers too, its more than east meets west, the production is very tight and the arrangements are really well worked. From Bulgarian folk music to the ambling Overland Blues via James Bond-type music and John Lennon covers, its amazing what these guys can do with just three strings each. This album is definitely worth buying."
4,Droll Yankees feeders gound mounted need this,"There is no other pole desigened to mate with Droll Yankees feeders (not all feeders accept a pole. But if you are going to ground mount it,use this. Many options for the pole greatly enhance the pole (e.g. Squirrel baffel / Tray. Adding a Suet feeder etc.Expect in rain and snow areas to replace every few years, as it is painted thin steel."
1,do not order from oldies.com,"i ordered this movie from oldies.com in june.they sent me the wrong disc in the right case. i called them and let them know, and they sent me a new one. this time it was the wrong disc in the wrong case. i had to send it back four times. and i still don't have the movie. they told me to just give. they were very rude, and did not appoligize once. save yourself time and money. do not buy from oldies.com"
4,Brian does it again!,I can't say enough about the talent of this artist. His songs are so well written-the words and music flow so smoothly. His performance of a ballad is always on target.
4,One of the better R&B albums of the year...,"Brian McKnight's ""Back At One"" is a great album with beautiful music and a man with a voice like butta...you be the judge..."
1,This CD Is Overated!!!,"I thought this CD would be one of Brian's best work but I was wrong. All of his songs sounds the same. Back @ One is a carbon copy of ""Anytime"". Sadness... =( I'm really disappointed with you Brian, I thought you would come out with a bang but this CD was a BIG DUD!!! Sorry to all of the B. McKnight fans but I'm just keepin'it real. So I would suggest to save your money and wait for it on the discount rack.Aloha..."
5,oh brian,"This cd is amazing. ""Back at one"" clearly defines Brian McKnight as a talented songwriter, producer, and vocalist. I recommend this to everyone. Songs such as ""Back at one"" and the amazing ""6,8,12"" has made Mcknight a talented vocalist. Please I mean Please buy this cd."
1,only worth buying for title track,I listened to the entire album and was very disappointed. Only worth buying if you really must have title track. Too bad it doesn't come in a single yet!
4,Good Interpretation of Beethoven's Piano Sonatas,"Now, Alfred Brendel is the best interpreter of Beethoven's Piano Sonatas alive, his 1990s cycle is the best one compare with his Vox cycle and the first Phillips Cycle (Recorded in 1970s). I like this recordings very much"
2,"Neat toy, but not terribly effective.","I got this in the hopes that it would substitute external speakers for my laptop; the ones in the laptop don't get loud enough for my tastes. The Soundbug *does* make sound loud enough, but only for some frequences, and it's so tinny and distorted, the sound is too unclear to be of any use!Long and short of it is, it's a neat concept and yay to the engineers at Olympia who thought of it, but it's not terribly effective."
2,the bugs with soundbug....,"As with the other reviewer, I had high hopes. Alas, they remain unrealized. I was hoping to have a way to listen to my MP3's on my laptop while on the road/in the hotel. My laptop speakers still do a better job than the soundbug. The best sound was gained from placing it on a large wall mirror. The bass in particular is lacking, and at louder volume levels there is signifigant distortion. If you have no other way to listen to your mp3's this is ok, but they overpromise and underdeliver on the quality and sound volume."
3,Okay for small area,"I bought this for my desk at work. For that I guess this is good. Personally I think it is alot to spend on something that doesn't sound so great. The sound is kind of tinny. No bass at all. But- it is a perfect size for my desk, and since I work in an office and I can't have it real loud the sound isn't as important anyway."
1,One size do not fit for all,"One size will not for every woman. Further belt around the waist is not tight for this G-String. Front side triangle area should be little more wider(I think). Size must be small, medium, large etc."
3,shorthand,"powerplay was predictable and if a movie is going to be just that, then make it more appealing, like a little more cool hockey scenes. the movie overall wasn't bad, just could of been better. average movie."
2,cliched rock n roll,"I heard a lot of hype about these guys so I checked them out in San Francisco a couple of months ago. Very average sound and performance. So, thinking it may have been a bad night, I ordered the CD (used). Same thing. Average sound - only with unimpressive lyrics and cliched hooks. What am I missing??"
5,Westlake always makes me feel guilty!!,"Donald Westlake writes books with characters that you just can't help but like. They can be, as in the great Dortmunder series, felons, burglars, kidnappers, but they are all likable. In this book, his characters are tabloid journalists, who are only a step above the lowest of the lows, defense attorneys. He skewers them, but some of them, DARN IT, you can't but help liking."
1,It not was what I looking for,"It has a little vocabulary, It is so basic.It doesnt have a lot of words."
3,Good enough. Although don't expect to much from it.,"This product is pretty good in terms of features, it has a reasonable word number if you have an intermediate English level. If you need only English, so I suggest you to buy an English only with more English words."
4,50% of the words,"I used this during a two week excursion to Italy and Germany. While it is not a substitute for having some knowlege of the languages (luckily we had someone for both), it had about 50% of the words I searched for in it. Phrases are not very helpful."
1,Bad translator,"Horrible!!!It does not help too much, not user friendly...I feel like I wasted my money"
3,Not a good match,"While I usually enjoy Diana Palmer's books, I didn't this one. I had high expectations b/c I have enjoyed her Soldiers of Fortune series so far. The hero was wonderful. It was the heroine I had problems with. She was too naive and immature to fit right with Cy. It was not a good match. Also, the ending was too abrupt. You did not get a good sense of the chatacter's feelings throughout the book. The pregnancy issue was a little too unrealistic. All women would realize whether they are pregnant or not. If there was a question, they would visit a doctor. However, it was great seeing the other characters in the book (especially Micah Steele) and the action was great."
4,Great phone system,"I bought the first Panasonic KX-TG2382B system about 2 years ago as a replacement for a Panasonic 900Mz. No complains. In June 2005 I lost one handset on our pasture and I could not find it anymore. So I bought a replacement handset and this one worked fine, too. All features. I thought about getting more handsets to have 4 phones available, so I bought a used system (base and handset) through an auction and spread the phones out in the house and feed-room. On these used handsets two keys don't work correctly, this comes with buying used stuff (my own fault), but for picking up calls they do fine. After seven months of Texas heat and even some rain I found the lost handset on the pasture again with minor scratches from our horses probably playing with it. I cleaned it from some dried up mud and charged it up again and the next day it worked again like it was brand new. Now I have 5 phones of this brand and system hooked to one phone line and I am very satisfied with it."
1,A horrible phone!!,"This has to be the worst phone I ever owned. I bought it because I liked the built in answering machine and the additional cordless phone unit, but it's given me nothing but problems. This surprised me because I had good luck in the past with Panasonic phones. The battery life is non-existent. It'll be fully charged and a 15 minute phone call would drain the battery completely making the phone useless. At first I thought I got a bad phone, so I took it back and got another one, the exact same model. Well I had the exact same problem! It was so frustrating to have a fully charged phone go dead after one telephone conversation. Don't buy this model... find another that has more than a 15 minute battery life!"
2,Need 24+ digit dialing,"I like all the features of this phone EXCEPT it will only store 22 digit phone numbers. I need 24-25 digits to store 11 digit phone # + 1 or 2 pauses and a 12 digit pin for prepaid phone card dialing. As an alternative speed dialing would work; one # for call and one number for pin. This phone has no speed dial capability.I will return the phone. Too bad - the price was right or ""too good to be true""."
2,What a waste...,"I purchased this case for my daughter's 8GB iPod Nano and she can not even plug in the earphones with the case on. The other problem is that there is difficulty with access to the hold button which is vital when you are on the go. On the other hand, the case is very sturdy and protects all the right parts on the iPod but she can't use the thing!! Maybe this is what I get for spending only $8.00 on a case. So disappointed."
3,You get what you pay for....,"This is an okay little case for your iPod -- however, I have found that the little closing mechanism is not the best. The case tends to pop open or doesn't close securely. I would not suggest this case if you are going to be doing a lot of movement with this thing around your neck on the included neck strap."
5,Awesome!,"Sonata Arctica have been one of my favorite bands for nearly two years now, constantly and consistently releasing incredible albums. Ive met them three times, and theyre definitely the most fan friendly band of the many I have hung out with. This cd/dvd combo is no exception. Ive been to 3 of their shows, and I must say the dvd did a really good job of capturing their performance and the ambience of the environment. For under $14, this is really a steal here on amazon. My only complaint...what's with the two page booklet? I was really hoping for a nice lengthy booklet with a lot of lyrics and or pictures, but hey for this price and a cd/dvd set this awesome, whatever. =]"
2,Pet Ramp Improvements,"The pet ramp is basically as described on the web site & has good traction but is too short for my needs. I needed it to help my maltese get up on my bed by herself but she has bad hips & can not manage the steepness. I wish it either came with some kind of folding short legs on the floor end of the ramp or an attachment that would raise the bottom end up 4-6"". I also would prefer it about 4"" less in width. Otherwise the ramp is sturdy & well made. Thank You, Rena"
3,dog ramp,"This dog ramp is sturdy poly but it is heavy. Specs say it is 11 pounds but it is awkward to handle. especially for my wife. You may want to consider something that is collapsible as this ramp takes up a lot of room in your van, SUV, etc."
5,"Excellent value, easy to assemble","We were looking for a new gazebo for our back yard. Others were either too cheap and flimsy or too expensive. This gazebo is sturdy, well designed, easy to assemble-- 30 minutes by my (mostly tool-challenged) self--and holds up nicely in the wind. Highly recommended."
3,Early Western swing.,"The music is fairly primitive and slightly stiff, but the transfers are decent. This album is recommended mainly for historical interest, for serious devotees of the genre."
1,Defective Merchandise,I bought this as a present and found out from the recipient that it was defective. By the time I learned of the defect it was too late to return it. Frowns all around on this one.
5,great recording,"This is chamber music at its best played by the masters, the Beaux Arts Trio. All the pieces are played in a crisp, clean manner with the proper emotion and phrasing."
5,misrepresented,they sent me one without a safety latch NOT the one in the picture-you want six more words? how about DECEPTIVE
4,Bargain,"Bought this from Amazon for viewing birds out my window and hiking. Clear. Easy to use. Does a remarkable job for the price, and I won't worry too much about dropping, losing, etc. such an inexpensive product. Nice case with velcro flap and it has a loop for the belt, but the binocs are so light and small that most of the time they'll fit in your pocket. No lens caps and the neck strap is just a string, however."
3,Not bad for the price,"If these cost much more than I would have to rate them lower but I keep remiding myself that the price was cheap.I bring them to sports events and they are pretty good. The optics are just okay but again, for the price, not bad."
5,"Compact In Size, Big In Benefits!","These are great binoculars. Easy to carry and handle, they focus neatly and amplify everything just fine. They are small, but you'll get a surprise when you weight them in your hands, and find out how substancial they feel. This was a wish from a young member of our family, who has short-sightedness. You just can imagine what a thrill these binoculars are, then, and what a blessing, too. Birds, buttlerflies, faraway buildings, everything is now within focus!I was looking for binoculars with a reasonable price, and with a good rating. I found ones with a very good rating, and an even better price! I am very pleased with this purchase!Ah, these black binoculars come with a black carrying case. This case has a tab at the back so you can put your belt through, or the strap of your back pack."
4,Bushnell Powerview 8x21 compacvt Binoculars,"These are a decent little pair of binocvulars. The light gathering power is not enormous, but I was able to see night sky objetcs well, andromeda galaxy and the Pleadies star cluster looked nice. They fold up and are fairly compact. Good for daylight viewing and bird watching, not the best out there, but good for being very inexpensive."
3,Nice Compact Binocular,"I actually bought these binoculars for a Justin Timberlake concert my son and I were going to. Having ok seats and not wanting to carry around a bulky, high powered pair, I purchased these binoculars. For the price, they really, really served it's purpose. It folds nicely and fits into any pocket or since it's lightweight, you can easily put it in the pouch provided and wear it around your neck."
4,"Good for the money, but not the greatest","I got these along with a bird identifier book to start watching birds around where I live. For the money, they're a great buy, but I regret not going for the Bushnell Nature View ones that are supposed to magnify light to look at feathers and such. I also wear glasses and they don't comply with those to the best extent. I would say these are a good secondary pair of binoculars to leave in your car or ones to bring when you don't want to worry about ruining them."
5,Just Perfect!,"I purchased this product for my husband, who recently develop the ""mature"" people hobby of bird watching. I first order the much powerful Bushnell binocular and have to return it as it was way too heavy for this hobby. This product however, does the job very well. it is easy to use, VERY COMPACT, smaller than i actually expected. Now we will be carrying this compact binocular where ever we go. in fact, i need to get one for myself, too!"
3,Sloppy Effort,"Devil Man isn't the best anime you'll find. The story starts very slowly and it clumsily lumbers along. The characters are all unlikable and/or uninteresting, and the voice acting is questionable. The hero's love interest is slapped into the tale as an afterthought, and serves as little more than the obligatory damsel in distress to be rescued late in the story. The animation is anything but breath-taking, with characters speaking complete sentences at times without their lips moving. The ending is very unsatisfying and anti-climatic. This is watchable if you're a big fan of the genre, but there is a lot of better stuff to be explored."
1,A dissapointment to Go Nagai,"When I first found out the Devilman was going to be released on DVD, I jumped at the opportunity to purchase it.To my dissapointment(and DISGUST)I realized that the disc did *NOT* offer the original Japanese Language. I am an anime ""purist"" and I used to watch the original Jap. Lang and read the scripts for translation so I *THOUGHT* the disc would have the subtitles. But instead I am *forced* to watch a great anime film with sub-par voice acting which totally killed the emotional content of this anime for me. Parts I thought were dramatic and serious, are now comical and humorous.So very sad. Im going to get rid of mine immediately and buy the Japanese only edition (no eng. subtitles - I still have my scripts)*Dont waste your money or time on this horrid edition*"
3,Not for beginners,"This book may be good but I was led to believe it was good for beginners as well as pro's. I does the beginner (me) no good at all. It went over my head from the first page. If you are just starting out with sonar this book is not for you, unless you have some experience. I am still trying to find a book that would be good for someone who has no clue about sonarin particular sonar vs-100."
2,Husband didn't like it,My husband loves eggs bennidict so we decided to make it at home. He didn't like the thickness and shape of the poached eggs. they come out like a triangle and are to thick also its very difficult to get the perfect consistancy of the eggs.. We don't recommend this product pay more for a better egg poacher..
3,The cooking HEN,Henrietta cooks hard boiled eggs perfectly but I was somewhat disappointed with the soft boiled eggs. They weren't done enough for me. She sits so nicely on the counter top for everyone to see.
3,"Does the job, but has some problems","The spacing is very tight, the cooker will hold seven eggs, but they need to be small. Also, water leaks during cooking. I do like the whistle which blows to let you know it's done. And it looks good on the counter top."
1,Henrietta boils over :(,"Hennrietta is cute, however, the cooker is too shallow and the water boils out over the sides. I eventually learned how much water to put back in and repeat the cooking, to get cooked eggs. Her ""chirp"" eventually reduced to an inaudible buzz and one day, blue electical arches danced from across her ""body"" into the puddle of water on the plate under her. Reluctantly, I had to throw her away."
1,egg cooker,"the eggs do not cook correctly and you have to plug in the electricity and un-plug the machine, it does not have a button to turn it on or off."
3,No manual included!,"I have not used this, as it was a gift for a friend. However, there was no manual included. Although I'm sure it's easy enough to use, it would have been nice to have a guide. Now now I have to hunt around the internet to look for a guide."
4,Makes good eggs fast and easy.,"This thing is great. You might have to experiment with how much water you want to use because I used the levels suggested in the book at first and had to change them a bit to get my desired results, but that is just a matter of taste. The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because it is a little hard to clean and there should be an on/off switch."
2,No Poaching,I received this cooker as a gift from my fiance. He knows I love poached eggs. Problem is I've tried this 4 times now and I have not been able to get it to work correctly. I put the water to the line shown for poached eggs and it doesnt cook either the white or the yoke. I've tried adding more water and adjusting it to longer cooking but I have yet to receive a cooked egg. I haven't tried it for boiled eggs but wonder how that could be accomplished if it won't even do a partially cooked item like poached eggs?I'm going back to the stove!
5,Henrietta Hen Egg Cooker,"I am a devotee of soft boiled eggs for breakfast. I've used electric timers and color changing egg in water monitors. Both have been usefull but the Hennerietta Cooked is by far the best I've used. I understand some of the other rater's comments such as lack of a switch and plastic construction. However, I find the unit to be marvelous as is. I am purchasing 2 additional units as gifts."
2,great idea poorly executed,"I love it's look, and it appears to cook eggs really well and accurately. However, the black paint has already begun to flake off, and the plastic housing for eggs and the top are very difficult to fit tightly because they appear to warp when hot. And it beeps when done rather than chirp, I was so ready for a chicken sound as the alarm."
3,Cheaply made,"I give this 3 stars because it does work to boil eggs. However, the Teflon or metal part is all chipped off and I am not sure how safe it is to use anymore and it leaves a big puddle of water around it while it's cooking the eggs. The lid also does not fit properly on the base and there is no on/off switch, you just have to unplug it to turn on and off."
1,"cute, that's all folks!",I got it to replace my Oster that broke down after 8 years of faithful service. This is cute but leaks water all over the counter and leaves eggs underdone for hardboiling.
3,"Cute, but!",I agree 100% with the other reviewer from CA. I gave her 3 stars for being so cute. If you buy her for poached eggs she's very disappointing. The eggs are too done on top and to runny on the bottom.
1,earphone buds for MP3- IPOD,"I would not recommend these ear buds- I am an average sized adult and they keep popping out of my ear- very annoying especially since I mainly use them while on the treadmill- my children 16,14,11 and 8 say they pop out also"
2,Disappointing,"If you love to admire the vulva as a beautiful flower buy Joani Blank's ""Femalia"". Nick Karras' sepia tone prints wash out the beauty of these women and frankly most of them are sporting stubble which is just unattractive."
5,Only way to enjoy coffee!,"Everybody in my family has one of these. We were only using our coffee maker to heat the water, finally put it away and installed a hot water dispenser at the sink. The only downside is that the base is too large for a cup holder. Anyone that I work with is impressed when on the train (I am an engineer) I get out the JetBoilJetboil Personal Cooking System (Black)to heat the water and then use my Liquid Planet Boot cut mug to make the best coffee that will stay fresh and hot for hours."
1,"Trying too hard, delivering too little","The plot of ""Tallulahland"" is obvious from the first page, and only habit kept me turning pages of this painful exercise in self-aggrandizment. The character of Tallulah is brillantly talented, and not shy about reminding the reader of that fact every five paragraphs or so. She's also obviously a thinly veiled avatar of the author, who likes reminding the reader every few pages that she's just slumming in chick lit by throwing T.S. Eliot references into dialogue so bad it gives Michael Crichton a run for his money. Not entertaining, not sexy, not fun. Stop insulting your readers, Ms. Messina, and give this genre its due. If not, try your hand at ""real"" literature and watch the rejections start rolling in."
3,Christianity Revisited,"This is not a book for summer beach reading but for the quiet solitude of the library or study. It is not escape lit. The style is from the 20's, in my view. It is quite academic bordering at pendantic, at times. In short, rather heavy trucking with many references to ancient history, the ancient and modern philosophers and writers.On the other hand, if you are into that subject matter, this book has nicely melded theology and history, and, if you make it through the first 20 or 30 pages and get used to the style, you will find it gets progressively more interesting and will reward you with considerable knowledge and insight.It is a must read for students of philosophy and theology, seminarians and ancient history buffs."
4,The good and the bad parts of this book.,This book is good for the general parts and has good short explanations on most areas. This book is not good a one source book. Yet it is an excellent complimentary source.
1,A horrible book.,"This book is one of the many books written by the imfamous Maasaki Hatsumi. Personally I find this book to contain little or no information of any importance and the authors inflated ego and constant arrogance quite annoying. Regrettably Maasaki Hatsumi poses as the ""difinitive word"" on ninjutsu but this book (and most, if not all, of his other books) is too full of anything but arrogance to make any reading of this book worth the time or money. Maasaki Hatsumi may know ""ninjutsu"" but what he really needs to learn is humility."
5,Great Book!,"This book is superior to many of its contemporaries on the subject of ninpo. Many areas are covered, most of which is devoted to the life and adventures of Takamatsu Sensei. The reader learns of his youth, training in the old budo tradition of the Shinden Fudo school, later learning the secrets of ninjutsu and traveling to China to further his studies. There are excellent B/W photos of woodblock prints, as well as several pages devoted to Gyokko style mutodori kata. This is a must-have for any practicioner of ninpo or koryu bujutsu."
3,Not impressed...,"Maybe I am doing something wrong, but the contrast of the pictures leaves me to do some pretty heavy photoshopping. I don't have that problem with any other lens (including my other Sigma lens). Most pictures, especially when zoomed in, have a gray tint to them. Unlike some other 4-5.6 Sigma lenses, this one doesn't perform very well in low light. This lense is average at BEST. The best part about this lens though is its macro capabilities. Zoomed all the way in, with the macro mode engaged, you can take some really first class macro shots. Overall, it's a decent lens, but nothing to write home about."
5,One of the Best animes!!!,"This is the anime movie that got me into the whole anime trend. Man!!! I loved this movie. The music, animation ect was all great. If you havn't seen this movie dont hesitate on buying it. You will not be disappointed. You don't have to be an anime fan to love the movie either. There was nothing in the movie that disappointed me, what so ever."
3,Anime from a seasoned line that stands on its own,"While some of the dialogue may be painfully slow to some of its more ""mature"" readers, the storyline and visuals more than make up for it. The transfer to DVD was not as crisp as one would hope, although it's not as bad as others.The reasons why I gave it only three stars(which may be a harsh review coming from a die-hard macross fan) is that I was hoping for more special behind-the-scenes or commentary, rather than Paul Stanley from kiss telling me not to do drugs(in full KISS regailia, nontheless)... I had also hoped for more Robotech/Macross related material rather than MANGA commericials.So, in summary, great series, bad packaging."
3,"very, very good","Jerry is an unbelievable percussionist. All the tracks have an undeniable rhythm, like most Cuban music does. Unfortunately, Jerry is kind of strung out on heroin. But he still plays his butt off. Definately worth checking out if you're into Afro-Cuban."
5,Best Nursing Cover! Great Price!,This is an incredible nursing cover at an incredible price! The functions of this cover make sense! I like that it actually covers and has a hidden pocket on the inside. This makes changing nursing pads so much easier. It is also very soft and lightweight. Well worth the money!
1,Not worth the money,"I was excited to receive this product, but was very disappointed when attempting to hang the puzzle. The weight of the paper made it impossible to stay on my walls using the very thin, double sided tape that is included with the product. There is nothing unique about the wall I was attempting to hang the item on. In addition, the construction was nearly impossible as the pages continually got stuck to one & other, ripping many times. Save your money, buy a bounded crossword puzzle book instead! As is, I will have to complete the puzzle in the ""folded lap version"" which will be annoying considering the clues are in a separate book!"
1,too heavy and hard to use,I purchased this product to make it easier on me and my 2 dogs and it only made things harder. The ramp is heavy and cumbersome to handle. It also takes up 1/2 of the trunk.
4,Pet Step Great But Heavy,I love this product. It is made well and my dogs love it too. The only problem I have is that it is a little heavy.
5,Love it!,"Our older dog sometimes has trouble jumping into the SUV, so we bought this for him. It was very easy to train both of our two dogs to use this ramp. We have had the opportunity to use this when we go on our long hikes, we are out for hours and have two very tired dogs when we get back. They walk right up the ramp with no problems.I have had the ramp for about two months and I would recommend this ramp as it is easy to use and to train a dog to use it. We keep it in our back seat to always have it handy. I look forward to using this ramp for years to come."
5,surprising,I wasnt expecting much from this CD. But was pleasantly surprised. It's wonderful background music
5,fun and easy to learn,"It is a beautiful product. I've loved it since i got it on the very first day. Eventhough i am a beginner, i can play the music with happiness all the time."
2,comments on Official Book of Kakuro,I think this is a good book for very beginners. For me it is too easy. Even the hard ones are very easy.
4,A good starter . . .,"I found this to be a good book to start on, not because of the introductory text, but because the easy section was designed to teach specific strategies. When I began the medium section, I found I really needed a chart of the ways to make each sum with different digits. I began developing my own before finding nicely designed ones in Gareth Moore's The Essential Book of Kakuro. Timothy Parker's book's paper quality, binding, and book size are all effective. I'll buy Book 2 when it comes out."
5,GOOD AND REALLY CHEAP,thees binaculars are easy to use. you get great focus and when my friend was 100 yards away and he was swinging his arms and i used theese binoculars i thought he was going to punch me
5,Great Grilling,The videos showed some of the best grilling techniques and recipes ever. Easy to follow and perfect for the amateur. Love the entire set.
5,works great,"Got this waterfall pump as a replacement for one that wasn't quite doing its job. This pump works great, and amazon delivered it in time to keep my fish and pond alive and doing well."
5,Ranger Lite,"A Gerber knife has been in my possession for over 35 years. My first was the Folding Sportsman I, which I liked so much I got a Mk I (II) in the military. Later I bought a FS II, a folding Gator, and a Suspension multi-tool. Living in an urban legal system I've had to shrink the length of my pocket knife down, and choose the Gerber Air Ranger. The handle is two CRC-checkered aluminum plates, for a great grip, and the blade (3.26"") opens in either hand. This locking blade has a small clip attached for wherever you put it. This is an extremely light knife and is barely noticable. Some articles have said that the blade is AUS-8 stainless, which holds an edge better. Whatever its composition, it's half-way serration and clip point blade put a lot of power in your hands for various duties. A great work knife for all-around chores."
2,"bleh, again, i've gotta say this was bad","okay; i wrote a review a few days ago and it didn't get posted. i saw this whole series and wanted to say it was not worth my time. this was the first el hazard i ever saw, and having heard how great el hazard was supposed to be i was soo dissapointed. all of the characters seemed stupid and annoying to me besides emperor dall and gilda who were cool, but not enough to make it good..my friend is a huge huge el haz fan and she didnt like it either because her favorite character ifrita (who i've never seen she wasnt in this) wasn't in this except for the credits and they put the main guy (forgot his name) together with a new girl character instead. anyway i would not recommend this i don't even know if i want to see oav1 now though i hear its much much better. i would recommend buying ""battle athletes"" dvds from this site instead that's from pioneer too and a GREAT series. that or lain which is also great. well thats my 2 cents; bye!"
1,Wedding Weekend Movie,"This movie had very little depth to both the acting and the script in reference to all genders. My first words after the movie were: ""this movie was weird"""
3,review,The movie was alright but very hard to follow. There were sad times and very funny times in the movie that were nice.
4,Entertaining,Good movie to watch on a weekend afternoon! It was entertaining and funny. It was your typical romantic comedy that is not going to win an Oscar but worth watching.
1,Just A Really Bad Movie,"This movie is so bad, if I could have given it a negative number of stars, I would have. The screenplay, the acting, the music - all of it was truly hideous. Don't waste a minute of your life watching this painfully horrible film."
4,Almost perfect.,"Nice little pair of binoculars for viewing outdoor events from a distance during bad weather. Only problem I have is the case is rather cheap and flimsy and I have difficulty putting the glasses away without taking the case off of my belt and then really having to jam the glasses into he case. The case is stretchable material, butthe glasses really fit tight. I would prefer a waterproof hard case to wear on my belt that would allow the glasses to just drop easily into it. Otherwise, the glassesare great. Nice clear view, easy to hold without dropping. These glasses are a great buy for the money and Amazon's price was far lower that I could find them anywhere else."
3,"Big sound, small price, no durability","We got this bugle at Christmas for my son's tricylce. I like it but it has since fallen apart, I don't blame the product entirely because my son does take things apart but it could be more durable and stand up to more ""little boy antics,"" after all, bugles are most likely to go on little children's bikes."
2,"Good store, bad product","Shipping was quick and well packaged.But the item quality was terrible.As someone already said, "" ..the bulb fell off after a few days of use"".. in my case it fell off on the 2nd day."
3,Action satisfaction,"The Originoo dirtee rotten scoundrel is at it again, this time WAAYYY stronger than he was on his third album ""Heroez 4 hire""Slammin'tracks include ""true skillz"", ""Queens""& ""Dirty"" this isn't maybe the illest udnerground hiphop of 2003 but still worth bumpin'especially if you are a fan of Jeru.Of course it's not as good as any of his first two albums but the beats are still closer to the old Jerus preemo-productions."
3,Very Basic Info,"I was disappointed with this book. Although I am a novice chef at best, I am an avid reader. Most of the tips can be found elsewhere. This book would be fine for someone who has not read about cooking/kitchen set-up and who has little cooking experience."
1,Would not purchase these again!,"I thought these binoculars were a waste of money. I can't see much far away, they do not seem to work."
2,Not worth it,"We decided to give these a try. It has a low price, good specs for birdwatching and safaris, and a reputable brand name. Never mind! The optics quality are not good and the two views do not line up. We are returning them and will try again with a more expensive pair.I am giving two stars instead of one because ""hate"" is too strong a word for an object you can simply get refunded!"
5,Good Buy!,I bought this after reading the earlier reviews. The binocular does hold upto most of what others had to say about it. The image quality is very good and the insta focus system makes it very easy to follow moving objects. The neck strap is cheap and is not worth having it on the binocular.
4,Good for the Money,"These binoculars are pretty decent. Of course, you can not zoom in and see a hair on an elephants bottom but they work well for close to mid range bird watching and seeing what is going on in your neighborhood. Lol"
3,"Good Binocs, but not for astronomy","Following the glowing reviews here, I bought these to use on the night sky. The binoculars are quite good and very powerful, BUT there is no way to attach them to a tripod. They are too powerful (and too heavy) to hold steady when looking at stars, especially for children, so without a tripod they are very frustrating. Buy a pair that has a tripod hole, or get a lighter, less powerfull pair."
3,"High on function, questionable durability","These binocs worked really well. I used them at the shooting range and it was easy to spot bullet impacts out to 200 yards or so. Clear optics and easy to focus.The downside is the durability. My 5-year-old dropped them onto concrete, probably about an 18"" drop. They were facing down, and the impact was on the rubberized portion of one objective barrel only. When I picked them up, the left and right images no longer aligned so I sent them back for repair ($10 S&H;).Bushnell responded that due to a bent objective barrel and prism damage, they were a total loss. Really? From an 18"" drop? To Bushnell's credit they offered to sell a replacement at only $38. I passed and bought the Legacy version with zoom.Another disadvantage is the flimsy cloth case that it comes with. You should probably upgrade, esp given the durability questions."
4,Woman rides with gang to find father's murderer.,"Kitty O'Shay had a mission. She had ridden with the notorious Barton gang to find her long lost father. She couldn't reveal who she was for fear her life would be endangered. Ryan Delaney was the only one who knew Kitty's secret, and he wasn't about to tell. But how could he know Kitty wasn't deceiving him too? The last book in the Delaney Brothers series is high on sensuality and high on adventure. There is one cliché in the character of stepsister Teresa, but Connie Mason seems to overcome that by giving her a much-deserved comeuppance. Ryan and Kitty are fine, sympathetic characters any reader can love."
3,Pleasantly readable.,"This book is very easy to read. Too easy, that it doesn't really stick to my memory after I put down the book. It's a pleasant, sometimes charming read.Its strength, a simple straightfoward style of narration, is also its weakness (to me). I never feel anything for the characters, mainly because I can't help feeling that I'm in some sort of cornball 60s western movie. Fun, exciting, but ultimately light in character development and emotional poignancy. Especially Rogue Ryan who is, unfortunately, the stock love-em-all-leave-em-all desperado-type man typical in these movies.For an adventure story, not bad, but for emotional drama, this one leaves me unmoved."
4,Works great after replacement,"The first unit I received was not holding the charge. After winding it for a minute, it would work just for few minutes.After replacement, the new unit is working just great. I keep it as an emergency flash light in the car and used it few times for camping."
2,no so good.,"i really didn't like this cd. i don't think the singer is very good. the melodies are kinda boring, but i do like the music. if they got a new singer i'd probably like it a lot better. i'm only 16 and a girl too, but i'd have to say this band sux!!!"
1,Disappointing,This book has minimal text/tips and only one level of difficulty. I have since seen another sudoku book with more puzzles with several levels of difficulty for only $2.99 at my local supermarket. This book is way overpriced.
2,cheap,You get what you pay for as these worked good for 10 or 12 gigs but then at least 3 of them were faulty. Too delicate (especially the actual end connectors) to last for road use. Might be OK for fixed installation or usage.
4,If you want to learn and memorize Kanji don't miss this book,"This book presents an easy way to learn and memorize Kanji. As a forigner who is living and studying in Japan this book can help to learn Kanji and presents a pictorial description of each Kanji. The philosophy of creation of each Kanji helps to memorize it as well as it's meaning. Introducing the Kanji Radicals to show the Kanjis of the same family effectively helps to learn the meaning and the method of writing. If, even, some one don't know how to read Hiragana or Katakana, using this book can read the Kanji"
3,Buy the DVC30 instead,"The Panasonic performs much better in low light and has more accessible manual features, and it's cheaper. I'm not saying that the Sony is a bad camcorder, though."
5,Amazing music,"Resurrection, Brian Vander Ark's first solo effort without the Verve Pipe, is an amazing display of thoughtful songwriting, gorgeous singing, emotive lyrics, and powerfully addictive hooks. You will love this album, and your mom will love this album."
5,every scout's dream,"I bought myself the Swiss Champ XLT as a present for getting my new SysAdmin job, and I've used it at work every day since I got it. Built with Swiss precision and has everything you'll ever need. A tad heavy, but for me it's worth it. Absolutely love this thing."
5,Great for putting kids to sleep!,"I absolutely love this CD! In fact this is our second one because we wore out the first since we played it so much. It is very soothing, and in fact we used it to help both our kids (now 4 and 18 mo) go to sleep since they were babies. I highly recommend it!"
1,"Tricky, not happy.","Bought these, little did I know they do NOT include the mounting ring - the only such product on Amazon that doesn't. It's mentioned very briefly on the description.Would it really be so much to add the ring in the pack?Pissed off that I now have to order MORE filters from a BETTER vendor who includes the mounting ring, before I can vaccuum.Learned my lesson, read every line of the description, you might be buying a product that conveniently doesn't include a needed and often replaced part."
2,Its not completely worthless.....,"I did not read the book but I did look it over carefully. I was hoping it would be a clear step by step guide to using IBD to apply the CANSLIM method. There is so much information in the paper that it is not easy to apply all the techniques in an efficient manner. There are almost too many choices and directions possible. This book is not a step by step guide nor is it all that clear. I did find it to be unnecessarily wordy and vague. It just seems to go over the whole paper in a long winded fashion but does not get down to the nuts and bolts of ""Smart Investing"" as I was hoping it would. Refer to William O'Neil's books for better guidance about how to invest. Also, if you are a subscriber, there is a large amount of useful information on the IBD website at Investors.com."
1,bad purchase,"I bought this pump and used it about 8 hours per day in my pond for four weeks. Went out one morning and found the pump wasn't working, I checked the gfi and found it had blown. I tried to reset it and it wouldn reset. I unpluged the pump and then could reset it. Thinking my gfi might be old I pluged the pump in direct to see if it would run the motor humed but wouldn't run. The motor has shot. I checked it with a volt ohm meter and found the motor was bleeding to ground. So $150.00 bucks plus shipping down the drain. Mine could be an exception and it did work well for the four weeks but wouldn't by another one."
5,Her pink Cadillac can fly...,"...at least that what she thinks. I first heard Lucia Pamela's ""Moontown"" on one of the now sadly out-of-print RESearch Incredibly Strange Music volumes. Even though all of the tracks were, well, incredibly strange, Lucia Pamela stuck out head and shoulders above the rest. When I was able to track down this CD, I leapt at the opportunity, ordered it, and proceeded to either amuse or annoy all my friends with it. ""Moontown"" is a drop in the bucket compared to some of the other tracks. This woman is absolutely crackers and I love her. The bio included in the liner notes explains a lot about her that I simply did not know including the rumour that she performed all the instruments accompanying her. If you find a copy of her colouring book in an antiques shop or flea market, please contact me! She's still waiting for my entry in the colouring contest..."
1,Ear drum rupture,"I don't know what is more painful, popping your eardrums with an ice pic or listening to Lucia Pamela's Into Outer Space. Yes, I did buy it more out of curiousity than anything else. I won't do that again! Not only is the recording bad, (yes, I know it is an old recording) but the musical compositions are hideous. Who told this women she could sing? Thank goodness time and space separate us as to hear her in person would be analogous to chanting an unholy entreaty to the Old Ones a la an H.P. Lovecraft story. Save your money or invest it in something you know will give you a more fulfilling aural experience."
1,major rip off,this disc is supposed to be free with your pre order of rebel strike rogue squadron III and yet they are selling it for $40even though the case for this disc says not for resale but they conveniently have no image available probably because they dont want people to know they can get this disc for free at other places with a rebel strike pre order
5,Regarding the transfer of the fifth.,"This is not so much a review as a question.I have owned the original analogue CD set for many years. Recently I purchased the original LP box from 1975. I don't have perfect pitch but it was obvious that the CD version of the fifth symphony had been transferred at a lower pitch than the LP version.I checked against the CD transer of the fifth in the Konwitschny version, also with the Gewandhaus and that level of pitch agreed exactly with the Masur LP version. So the original digital remastering of that performance seems indeed to be below correct pitch. My question therefore to anyone who might know is: Have more recent masterings corrected this pitching error?CheersMichael Woolley"
5,wonderful,"We had a bushnell that finally wore out after twenty years, and tech out paced it. I bought a pair of glasses from another vendor, and these. This is a superior set. Easy to adjust, powerful, in fact too powerful for our backyard feeders, we use the compact pair for the yard, and save this for the beach and bird walks. Bushnells are not super compact, but the compact 8 x40 model I bought is going on Ebay this week.good buy, should last another twenty years.If you are a new birder,keep it simple, buy these and several birdbooks, have fun."
2,Look elsewhere for beter great white documentaries!,"If you have read my other video reviews you will know that I love the Discovery Channel's treatment of marine animals. This 90 minute monstrosity is an exception. I received this as a gift and I hope that the giver doesn't read this review! What starts out as a good idea goes bad. This video is a collection of footage about great whites from a variety of previous documentaries. Is the discovery channel just trying to make more money with no investment? It comes off as a hodgepodge of pseudo science, interviews with attack victims and footage of the worlds largest active predator swimming around cages in chum laden water. There are a variety of great white videos out there... do yourself a favor and check them out."
5,Must Have,If you have any involvement in problem solving (and who doesn't) this book is a must have. It is a very organized library of tools and techniques for all facets of the problem solving process. If is out of print but find it and add it to your collection.
4,Has a Great Ring!,This is so super cute! We purchased this to go on my son's Kettler Air Navigator Tricycle he is getting for his 2nd birthday (shshsh!). The sound is great and the lever is easy to use. It isn't too heavy and should be very easy for the thumb of a 2 year old to operate. Ring! Ring! Ring! On your left!
4,It does what it's supposed to do.,"It rings pleasantly, but loudly enough to be heard.Red finish looks nice on my black folding bike.When the bike is in my bumper carrier on a parking lot, lots of folks can't resist ringing it as they walk past, and everyone smiles when they do it. Where else can you make so much happiness for around twelve bucks total?"
3,Handsome and heavy but crown came off (!),"I have this watch in a different color. It is a handsome watch with some heft to it, which I didn't mind. I don't know what the outer bezel is for ... it turns smoothly both ways, and goes up to 24, but I can't see how it has anything to do with military time.I wore mine for a while, and was happy with it, until the crown came off one day. It is probably partly my fault, as the last three watches I have had have had problems with the crowns -- although usually they just get pulled up and stop the watch and I lose time. This one it just came up missing one day. Too bad.If you don't go around destroying watches, and you like a heavy watch with a big easy-to-read dial, you might like this one. Also the crystal seems to hold up nicely.good luck"
4,For the Golfer with Everything,"If you are looking for a gift for that special golfer, this should do it. It has everything a golfer could want on the course."
1,A treat for the eyes but not the ears!,"I bought this movie to show kids, but it is way too boring for them. The whole first 20 minutes or so, they show a dazzling array of chocolate treats, but there is no talking at all! I kept hoping they would say something because I was curious about what I was seeing, but they never did! Very frustrating. Kids won't sit for it either. They eventually do start talking, but it's very general stuff about how great and wonderful chocolate is, but nothing about how it is made or the science behind it. DO NOT buy this for educational purposes!"
2,Low power inflator,"As mentioned in another review, the inflator has little to no power and will get hot after just 5 minutes."
3,SO SO,"I KNOW IT WAS MY FAULT BUT I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED TO REALIZE THIS CD IS NOT MIXED. AFTER ACCEPTING THAT, I WAS SADDENED AS THE SONGS GOT WORSE AND WORSE TOWARDS THEEND OF THE CD. THE 1ST FEW TRACKS ARE GOOD"
3,Not What Expected,"Lots of history in this book. That's good. Very small amount about Father Lazarus. Disappointing. Quite a bit about the author, his aspirations and where he sees himself on the spiritual journey. So scholarly that I felt the need to have a dictionary by my side but decided otherwise. My best friend read it with a dictionary and found that many, if not all, of the words used in the book had very simple English terms that everyone could understand. Well, unless you are very, very well educated in language (maybe that remark simply shows my lack of) get your dictionary out as you read. Honestly, I read every single word in the book...even those I did not know the meaning of and my conclusion is to suggest that those interested in the Desert Fathers will find far greater teachings and much more humble explanations in the four volumes of The Philokalia. In other words, go to the source and meet these men through their words. These teachings have changed my life."
1,Horrible...that's the nicest way I can say it,"I like to be propelled along with a story. I like to READ a story, I don't like to be TOLD a story. There is not enough dialogue to move this story along. Too much is told to the reader and it's very repetitive. Also, every chapter doesn't have to end with this ""dun-dun-dun"" moment. Overall, this book is very amateurishly written. It's the first book I've read by the author and it will definitely be the last. Finishing it was like pulling teeth."
1,Not the WORST musical I've ever heard--but a contender.,"Dreck! Absolute dreck! This may not be the worst musical on CD that I've ever heard, but it certainly is a contender. The new ""music"" is practically unlistenable, the dialouge between numbers is embarrassing, and across the board the performances are weak--except perhaps for Rachel York doing her best to imitate Leslie Ann Warren (from the film) note for note. Thank heavens I saved my money and previewed this by borrowing it from the library first."
1,Sad sad sad.....,"I thought the musical was supposed to be even bigger and better--but from this CD, it's obvious that it's Not! It just seems silly the changes that were made from the movie version. One of my favorite songs 'The Shady Dame from Saville' was totally cut and this frothy 'Louis Says' was put in its place. Dreadful! The 'Shady Dame' was such a wonderful way to end the movie as well, and it was some obnoxious 'Victor/Victoria' thing. I Know most musicals have a song that goes with the title, but really, it was just obnoxious. I saw the live touring performance--it wasn't any better! So....be ware! For die-hard Julie Andrews fans, it's a big let down from the film."
2,What A Letdown!!!,"This movie was such a letdown. Spielberg's film was not only lacking in the storyline, but the special affects were about the same as the 1953 version, which was excellent for its time. As a matter of fact, that's all this movie showed me... Special Affects and nothing more. The screaming kid got on my nerves right from the get go. Someone wrote a review that the movie should have been longer... You've got to be kidding, right? Any longer and I would have run from the theater yelling: The Martians Have Landed!!!!"
2,war of the idiots!,I watched this movie with my cousin hoping I would like it and instead I was disapointed. I really think the animation was good but the storyline needed some work. For the first time in movie history Spielburg has failed. If the aliens were the super diabolickle geniuses then why couldent they just think of something old like the super....mega....ultra lightning ray gun but oh I forgot THey used lightning to awaken the giant robotsBut why couldnt they use that lightning to put a hole through earth. Spielberg If you want to make a good movie stick with that idea.
2,Hmmm,"Interesting at times, boring at others . The movie was not what I thought it would be , but it was nice . I would recommend checking it out . The acting is supurb but the storyline...is not. There was no war, an invasion and thats about it, one grenade and it was all over with."
1,Not all the hype made it to be,"Disappointing, no excitement. Blah.You'd be better entertained getting a DVD of Mars Attacks !"
1,I want my time back.,"By the end of the film I hated the camara man. I thought to myself, ""Point the camera over there! There is something interesting going on behind the actors! LOOK!"" But, no. The camera remained on dull and uninteresting people as the alien invasion unfolds, progresses, and concludes. Welles would weep."
4,What if this actually happened?,"War of the worlds is the film adaptation of H. G. Wells's story on the radio depicting aliens taking over the earth.The movie does a very good job of portraying what actually would happen using technology and stunning special effects to capture the imagination of the people watching the film.The narration is done by Morgan Freeman, who does a great job. The movie starts out with the mom dropping the 2 kids (Robbie and Rachel) at her ex-husbands house because she is going to Boston to visit her parents! Communications are not going so until a freak lightning storm hits and all Hell breaks lose, leaving Ray (dad) to protect the kids throught all the chaos.Overall it is very good film that really captures your imagination and makes you appreciate nature for all it's worth."
2,Great movie ruined by Tom Cruise's mugging,"Stephen Spielberg did a good, but not a great job, of directing this remake of the classic H.G. Wells book. However he made the wrong choice in leading men. Tom Cruise fakes his way through this film and to be honest if you watch it you will notice that the camera is almost always on him and not on the aliens out destroying the world. I hated the business of the tri-pods being hidden underground. Gee don't you think we might have noticed by now?All in all this is a movie that would have been very good if Spielberg had used a good actor instead of Tom Cruise. As it was his over the top bad acting ruined it and earned him the Golden Raspberry he won for his acting here."
3,War of the Worlds DVD with Tom Cruise,"This is a good action flick, and Dakota Fanning is a great little actress in it. It follows the book only VERY loosely and is set in the current day U.S. rather than 19th century England. There is frequent use of strong language, and some scenes could be frightening to younger children. Otherwise it's a very entertaining movie."
3,Definitely Not The Original,"Overall, the movie was decent. I am not going to get into the story since most people probably already knows it. I would have rated this at 4 stars, but Dakota Fanning's constant screaming about everything ruined the film for me. I figured with her talents, the writers/director could have given her a few other lines. Also, the son could have been written in as being not such a pain in the neck."
3,What's All the Hype ???,The acting sucked (eekkk the Martains have landed) I gave it 3 stars for the special effects.
1,"grainy, dull, boring, stupid, waste of blu ray disc, puke!","Buying this on blu ray is like putting an old scratch 38 recording into a digital format and selling it as some kind of high tech format. The movie is made grainy and there is no point in even putting it on a DVD. A VCR tape format is too nice for this dispicable form of film. Even if you could look past the realy crappy low resolution video quality, the movie itself is so absolutely terrible in regards to acting, directing, editing and every other aspect that every body seeing this will be severely dissapointed. I have to say, I would rather have my testicle stapled to a wood floor and be forced to slowly stand up than to watch this film again. Stay away from this hyped up nonsenes. read a book, even a bad one will be miles ahead of this joke of a film. and you will puke less."
3,Wait to buy,"Well, I wish I'd waited until this movie hits the $7 discount bin. The action scenes are great, and there's enough scary aliens & spaceships to make it interesting. The special effects are great. But .......... I guess I had expected more from the movie. Tom was darn lucky to have the only running vehicle in the world (you gotta know a good mechanic)! The movie just kinda ended. Just like that. If you hadn't read the book, or seen W.O.T.W.#1, you may had been kinda wondering 'What just happened?'. Hopefully the drug companies never sell Tamaflu to any aliens."
3,Good but not great,"I thought this movie was good but not great. The special effects was amazing but many times the effects got in the way of the story and the ending was short and lame. Tom Cruise was good as always and Dakota was also good. The music was okay and I'm not 100% sure if I wanna buy this 2-disc edition. Maybe I rent it first and see if I like more, a second view. I really tried to like it more but as I said, the effects got in the way of the story and sometimes too much of it. I have never seen the original from the 50's but maybe I will check it out someday."
5,War of the Worlds is wonderful! The 3 W's!,"This is a wicked cool movie. The fight scenes are well, both in the terms of graphics and intensity, the acting is great, there is lots of suspenseful music and good special effects(like many movies I've seen before)and the aliens are gross and slimy like they should be, as are their machines and their tentacles. There is also much love and feeling in this movie, as well as purity and iron will. I give this movie a 9 out of 10, and recommend it completely to anyone who is interested in outer space or wars of any sort, kind, or like. Oh and just like with Batman Begins, Elektra, Daredevil, and AVP(all of which are wonderful movies)people took an R-rated movie and did some mangling to this one. Whatever, it rocks. Big time. Real big time."
2,IS SOOOO OVERPRICED!!!!!!!!,"Yes, I liked the movie a lots good special effects and a lots action. But ""double disk for $26.00?????? Never heard of""!! Is not even EXTENDED CUT OR DRICUT or GIFT set!!! Its just a ""RIPOFF BIG TIME""!!! Wait goes under $20.00, Then buy it, like i'll do !! is to much money for so much little .LOL Is not ""TITANIC"" OR ""GONE WITH THE WIND"" Nor best picture of the year!!Even that wouldn't be $26.00 for double disk! B.S!!"
3,The original alien invasion of Earth.,"No longer are they from Mars, but from someplace far beyond us. They strike without warning and at a time of their leisure.Some of the sequence of this film makes no sense, and the flight to Boston to find people still alive when population centers are being wiped out is kind of hard to believe.However, the special effects and the horror of this movies are unequivocally good. From the get go you are following a broken family on the run from the extermination tripods of the aliens who no one knows, and who is never identified throughout the film. They keep coming, though. Nothing stops them. Until one day they just die.Spielberg could have made a better film out of this story. All he had to do was add a little science to the fiction. That is the sole basis for my complaint with this film. Otherwise, it holds ground as a very good sci-fi film, and it was eminently better than ""Independence Day."""
1,YAWN,"Spielberg and Cruise...two of the biggest hacks in Hollywood!If Steve-o really wanted to make a scary film, he should have done TomKat The Movie! Scientology aliens land on earth to ""clear"" your abberations while TomKat do their best to convince a skeptical public of their amazing romance. Featuring Mimi Rodgers and Nicole Kidman as the Beard Beasts and Ken Ryker as The Wrestle Buddy."
3,War of the Worlds (with Tom Cruise),This movie is good and I would advise you too add this to your collection. If you like Tom Cruise this movie is even better as Tom is in the whole movie.
4,good entertainment,"H.G. Wells story and pretty Dakota Fanning, what else you can ask for. If you are a fan of TOM then even better. watched plenty of times. maybe overpalyed a little but still a good flick"
3,War of the Worlds,"The extraordinary battle for the future of humankind through the eyes of one American family fighting to survive it. Ray Ferrier is a divorced dockworker and less-than-perfect father. Soon after his ex-wife and her new husband drop of his teenage son Robbie and young daughter Rachel for a rare weekend visit, a strange and powerful lightning storm touches down. Spooky and playfully, spectacular visual effects. Reasonably entertaining."
4,Great movie for this genre,"What a scary fun ride!And I don't care if Tom Cruise is a little wacky when it come to his personal beliefs... he is a great actor, who doesn't get enough respect professionally. I always enjoy his work."
2,Too much special effects; too little screenplay or plot,"Definitely not Spielberg's best. He tries too hard to make a different movie but ends up relying excessively in inane special effects and confusing plot diversions. Many opportunities were lost that may have conveyed a more convincing story. And the ending arrives so disappointingly...For a much better plot and ending see the original 1953 movie, also."
2,One Big Special Effect,What a dissapointment to what could have been an amazing re-telling of a remarkable sci-fi story. This movie was one big special effect from the beginning to the end. The story was lost. H.G. Wells would roll over in his grave.
4,Flawless Fun Alien Flick,"It was great! I know some people don't quite agree, but I thought it was an excellent alien movie. It was a great movie for Speilberg to direct and had great roles for Tom Cruise and Dakota Fanning, both of whom were fantastic. I know some people don't like the ending, but it is the same ending as in the book and I actually liked it. It was a good resolution to a good movie."
2,Good Special Effects - Maudlin Story,"Good thing the martians invaded, otherwise this poor dysfunctional family might never have worked out their problems.Honestly, the kids in this movie were so spoiled and whiny I was hoping the martians would fry them with their death ray.Plus the basement scene was idiotic."
2,Lots of Hype but Little Substance,"I tried to view this movie with an open mind and had great hopes for it when it began. This quickly faded as I realized this was just an adaptation of the ""Amazing Race"" with a slight change of cast. The special effects were good, as can be expected, but seriously there is not much of a plot - Tom Cruise is running from aliens and their terrible machines, trying to keep his two kids alive. I have to admit I didn't catch the very end, as I either had to use the rest room or took a phone call. The original is better."
2,The film just doesn't do it!,"There are better versions of the H.G. Wells story on in video format. Tom Cruise has done better work and hopefully will again. His character seems to need a spine and some Murine, not anything like the H.G. Wells hero! The ""Tripods"" are ok, the SFX are okay, the plot sticks somewhat close to the book. Batman Begins was much more interesting! If you already saw that one, check out Mr. and Mrs. Smith!!!!! That's techno and funny!"
1,Typical Spielberg Just Special Effects,Very dissapointing film except for the special effects. Save your money and wait to see it on cable...better advice is to rent the original. The plot is as shallow as any film I have ever seen.
2,The special effects are believable the plot is not,"There are so many problems with the plot that it is completely unbelievable.1. Thousands of thees tripods have been buried for millions of years but none were ever accidentally dug up or other wise discovered2. These extraterrestrials are far more advanced than the people of earth but the haven't yet discovered antibiotics.3. The whole Earth is destroyed except the house his ex-wife is staying at.4. There is a flaw in the tripod that it can not suck you up into it if a couple of people hang on to you.5. When all the electronic equipment was fried buy the lighting strikes some equipment was still working.etc, etc."
2,Disappointing,"The special effects were clearly the star attraction rather than the story. They were seriously overdone and the acting, even with Tom Cruise, who happens to be a favourite, didn't help much. A BIG disappointment."
2,"""WAR"": the GOOD, the BAD, and the UGLY","Tons of reviews already, so I'll keep mine short:(A) THE GOOD:1. Eye-grabbing special effects (esp. when humans get zapped by ray-guns).2. The lighting is dark, atmospheric; good used of filters and dark tones.3. Love the BOMBASTIC BOOM bass sound made by the alien ships!4. Very appropriate, engaging musical soundtrack / special sound effects.5. Good use of crowds and mob scenes.(B) THE BAD:1. Tom Cruise's singing.2. Tom Crusie's acting / non-acting.3. Shut that screaming child up!! Bad directorial decision to have the daughter scream throughout the movie. One word: annoying.4. The ending. It worked well with the original ""WOTW,"" but seems inappropriate now.(C) THE UGLY:1. Ugly, unsympathetic characters, esp. Cruise's 2 spoiled brats.2. The uninteresting sub-plot of Cruise and his 2 kids takes away from the alien invasion.3. Cruise & Spielberg get minus marks for this failed remake of a CLASSIC."
2,Dysfunctional Family Flim,"Let's have no doubts about the outstanding individual performances. Cruise continues to amaze as an actor who can carry a movie by playing any part given him to its fullest expectation. That said, don't watch this movie expecting to see a science fiction version of War Of The Worlds, as you would normally expect. If you want to see a dysfunctional family at its best, this is your kind of film. I was greatly disappointed in that I expected to see the usual military/government verses the alien's confrontation. Something on a grander scale. That was my mistake."
4,Very spectacular,"Tom Cruise does a fine job of acting, but this film left me unsatisfied. The H. G. Wells story was well done, but in this movie, the Martians just seem to be everywhere, acting in a rather arbitrary and often inconsistent manner. There is plenty of action, and some of it is well done, but some is overdone. I think true suspense involves putting people in trouble where they have a good chance to survive, not embellishing the amount of trouble beyond reason."
3,"not quite what i expected, but still pretty good","i would give this 3.5 stars but thats not quite possible. Anyways, it was a pretty good movie, though i expected more, and something differnt. I did like the begginning, and i really loved the ending, but the middle didnt please me much, from when the family gets in the car and starts making thier way to boston( i believe it was boston), until the basement fortress scenes, it just wasnt as good as i thought it would be, though i thought it did a great job of portraying how people act in situations such as these....but i think that my expectations for alien movies after ""signs"" are now so high that not much pleases me....but overall, a good movie, i defaintly recommened at least renting it"
4,"Very Good, but Not as Great as I Expected","First off, the Special FX are some of the best and most realistic to come out in quite some time. To see the alien machines hovering over (and destroying!) New Jersey and Boston is breathtaking to say the least. The acting by Tom Cruise, Dakota Fanning, and Tim Robbins is solid overall, but nothing memorable (thankfully none of the acting hurt the film). The quick conclusion was a bit of a letdown and one character surviving reminded me that I was watching a hollywood produced film. Steven Spielberg has crafted a good film here that easily outshines the work he has done in the past few years (Minority Report was good as well) and reminds us all that he still has the stuff when it comes to summer blockbusters. A solid 4 out of 5 stars for the sheer visuals and the overall enjoyment value."
2,good movie but,good sci fi from speilberg too bad i didnt get the dvd only the case oh well what do expect used for 4 bucks
1,"WTF NO HD , VHS Quality !!!!","i dont care about the extra futures, i dont give a dam about the shiny little boxit comes in. Give me HD Picture Quality and Sound, thats what Blu-ray is all about.Im sick and tired of seeing this film with White Grains on it, try pressing Pause on the movie, and there is no details on the people, its all disorted, I dont care what other Kiss Ass people say, i loved this film, and couldnt wait for it to come out on Blu-ray and only to see it Ruined by all this Fuzzy Grains on it, couldnt they do a Remaster Version of this, or give us the option if u want the Fuzzy Grain version of the Movie or with out it in Crisp Clear HD Quality. is one of my favorite movies, and i hate to see it Ruined, and i douth there will be a Recall for this Blu-ray movie. This is Truly Blu-ray at its worst !!"
1,BIG disappointment!,This is a real stinker and just plain stupid. First 10 minutes had our attention and then we had to force ourselves to finish the thing. We suggest you watch the original HG Wells movie and pass this one up. BIG disappointment!
1,THIS MOVIE STINKS LIKE A HIGH SCHOOL FOOT BALL TEAM,THIS MOVIE STINKS SO BAD I TOOK IT HOME AND MY FAMILEY BLEW CHUNKS!!!!!!!!!!! LET ME RUNINE THE ENDING FOR YOU TOM CRUSE AND HIS FAMILEY LIVE EVEN THE SON WHO YOU THINK DIED. ALSO LET ME TELL YOU HOW EARTH WINS THE ALIENS GET SICK AND DIE FROM THE BLOOD THE DRINK AND EAT FROM HUMANS!!!!!!! OW DONT BE FOOLED BY THE ONE STAR I WOULD OF LIKED TO PUT NEGATIV ONE BILLION!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! IN CONCLUSION THIS MOVIE STINKS
2,"Great special effects, good remake, not Tom's best performance","This was a good remake film, but to be honest, it was just okay. I actually fell asleep watching it. Not overly impressed with Tom's performance especially with his off screen display of discoloring comments centering around depression and religion. It's fine to have your opinion, but he's using his celebraty status to use as a billboard for his political views and it's staining his image. Now, he's not just an actor, but an outspoken political natzi. I liked him more when he was quiet and smiled that gorgeous melt me smile."
1,Not War of the Worlds,"This is not the story ""The War of the Worlds"" by H.G. Wells. This is not a Sci-Fi adventure movie.This is a movie about Tom Cruise playing his typical role of immature boy-man coming of age and taking up the responsibilities of manhood. This movie is 95% about Cruise and his 2 kids from a divorce and how messed up their relationship is. Interspersed with inane and just plain ridiculous reactions by Cruise and his teenage son you will see some shots of alien war craft death-raying pedestrians.An extremely forgettable film. Definitely rent before you buy and I wouldn't recommend renting it at the ""New Movie"" price unless you happen to like Tom Cruise."
1,"Spielberg, what happened?","Maybe I watched the movie expecting more since Spielberg was the director. I have the say the special effects were outstanding but the rest of the movie was horrible.The character development was bad. There were several scenes that were downright stupid. When Cruise and his kids make it to the ex-wifes house after the first attack, does Cruise turn on the t.v. or check the radio? No. If they didn't work then show that. It would lend a little more credibility to being uterly alone. He never once tries to find out what is going on else where. The fight between Cruise and the crazy guy (Tim Robbins) in the farmhouse. Really stupid. And the end. They should never have had the 15-year old son make it back to his grandmothers house in Boston (Cruise and his son had been separated mid-movie). Come on. Everyone else died in the group he was with but he made it back to complete the family unit and call Cruise dad. Again, stupid.I'm so glad we rented, not purchased the movie."
4,Strong Beginning Weak Finish,While I enjoyed the War of the Worlds in general. Especially the performance of Tom Cruise and Dakota Fanning. They were both compelling and dynamic. The end of the movie felt like a rush job. Also the acting of Tim Robbins were great as the creepy rescuer. If you are into special effects this also the movie to see.
1,Almost as good as Battlefield Earth,"The only reason Battlefield Earth edges out this turd is that it was at least funny. If you are a fan of plot holes, screaming children, loud explosions, Tom Cruise face, more plot holes, playstation animation effects, very unlikable characters, and alien ships with human toting cargo nets then this one's for you. Speilberg and Crooz should hide in the closet for this one."
4,Plush Truffles Pig,"A most darling ""stuffed"" toy. I love the plush truffles pig and know my granddaughter will also. She'll turn 1 yr. soon. The toy is well constructed and just right for cuddling. The material used is plush and soft. Jelly Cat makes great products."
5,Fantastic book for people who want to explore the UML world.,"The book ""Designing Flexible Object-Oriented Systems with UML"" is absolutely brilliant.I have just ventured into the UML field,I found the articles lucidly explained. I found the Design Problems and Object-Oriented Solutions very helpful,it's given me a fantastic start in a very small timeframe,Something like a rocket firing off at the countdown of 10.I have gone thru the device polling problem. [ Design Problem 1 You must develop software that allows clients to periodically check for changes in the status of devices in a network. ]Just from one sentence ,The way the problem was tackled can teach a layman to design a given system.Cheers"
3,Great Beginners Book,"This book is well written and organized. The four-color center section is a nice touch.That said, this book is lacking much beyond the basic use of FrontPage. Beginners will find this book easy to read and follow. However, once a basic understanding of FrontPage is gained, the book is of little value.So, if you're looking to learn FrontPage 2000, buy this book. If you're looking for how to maintain, enhance or streamline an existing site, this likely isn't the book for you."
1,"Order KEM cards, recieved Bicyle cards..","I ordered cards, read the details, saw the item picture.. I decided to order.Instead, I got other cards, other company and totally not what I wanted.Wrote the seller, which answered me that the cars that I wanted are not in stock - so why selling them???? and why sending something else???Very disappointing, 3 weeks later and I'm still waiting for a refund.."
2,Not worth the money.,"These are pretty nice cards. They feel real nice and shuffle well. But for the money they are simply not a good value.I use Copag, Modiano, and Dal Negro plastic cards and decided to give these KEMs a try. I've never seen such bad quality control as these have. There were several cards in one deck which were badly scratched across the back rendering one deck unplayable.I received no response from ChipandGames so I sent the deck back to USPC in Cincinnati (fingers crossed). We'll see what happens.Long story short... don't buy KEM cards. I've used a TON of plastic cards for poker over the years and while KEM cards do have a nice feel to them (about as nice as Copag) they are simply too fragile and easily marked.At nearly twice the price of Copag these KEM cards are absolutely laughable to me. I consider them and the entire USPC a joke. How can they expect to compete with oversees companies who produce a far better product for half the money?Buy Copag... end of story."
1,beware!!,"Please avoid this place , I ordered Kem cards and was sent a different brand that cost an 1/8 of the price. This is not an honest reseller. Avoid the aggravation."
5,mozart for morning coffee,"just like it so rightly says ""freshly brewed to perk up your day"" was perfect. I enjoyed all the CD. Its selections are very relaxing and you start your day and continue with a cheerful very uplifting melodies to get your day going lovely while you enjoy your cup of java..Just perfect!"
4,"Old, but fun!","Okay, okay, so CFS is showing its age. It still runs better than the rest of the series, which, even with high-end gaming PCs, tend to get ""glitchy."" The large dogfights can be a blast. As arcade-like as it may be, CFS is still the best bargain flight sim on the market in this humble PC pilot's opinion."
4,GREAT GAME,"I PLAY THIS GAME FOR A YEAR NOW AND STILL LOVE IT, BUT THE CONTROL WAS REALLY BAD U NEED A JOYSTICK TO PLAY THIS GAME GOOD, IFOR SOME HOW I CAN'T PLAY THE MULTIPLAYER, IT PREATTY HARD FOR ME TO SIGN UP FOR MULTIPLAYER, I HAVE FINISH THE CAMPAIN ALREADY CLOSE TO A HUNDEAD TIMES ALREADY AND START TO THINK I SHOULD GO PLAY OTHER NEW WWII GAMES, MY CHOICE IS CALL OF DUTY A VERY COOL GAME I HEARD ABOUT, BYE."
5,G-Free Mac & Cheese,"Annie's G-Free Mac & Cheese, is awesome. For kids or adults having a replacement for Kraft M&C is great. Having eaten both, I admit there is a taste & texture difference. If your child is newly diagnosed with Celiac, then they may not like this the first time around. Be patient, it will likely take time for them to get used to it. Amazon's price for a case using subscribe & save is probably the best deal around."
4,Great alternative!,"We finally found an alternative GF mac n cheese. The kids sure miss my Kraft every now and then so when we stumbled upon this alternative that was GF we were so happy! At least they can now have some good GF mac n cheese that doesn't seem all to different from the regular Kraft version. The noodles look like Krafts, however the cheese is slightly different tasting. Not bad but just not exactly Kraft. We add extra deli american cheese to ours and that seems to help."
4,A great wheat free alternative,"When we recently found out my teen son had a wheat allergy, macaroni and cheese was one item he was worried we wouldn't find a replacement for. He was almost right. After trying several, we came across this one. If it passes the taste test of a teen boy, it's definitely worth a try!"
5,Super Tasty GF Mac & Cheese,"After many flops we tried Annie's Gluten Free Mac & Cheese and it's an instant winner. My little one declared it delicious, with the right color and consistency. It does need a bit of salt to perk it up, but that is easily rectified.Thanks to Annie's for making GF mac & cheese easy and tasty!"
3,Annie's Homegrown Rice Pastas,Annie's Homegrown Rice Pastas are the best we have found and we are of Italian heritage. We served it to our guests. They all say they could not tell it wasn't wheat when we tell them that they had had rice pasta. It is delicious and works well with Hot & cold dishes.
5,Yummy Gluten-Free Mac n Cheese,This is the ONLY GF mac n cheese my picky 12 year old will eat. If you miss Kraft Mac & Cheese will certainly replace that missing feeling. My other two children (who aren't gluten restricted) also like this product. I used it last Thanksgiving when I was hosting and no one could tell any difference they were in awe. I recommend this to all my newby GF diet friends.
1,not ready to go,"think it's add water and nuke? nope; you get 12 small boxes not half filled with pasta and a small pack of squishy cheddar; boil 10-12 the way you would with other pasta, then the cheese- oh, and then you need milk- for #30 some bucks?; get a real box of gluten-free pasta, a chunk of cheddar and a quart of milk for maybe 1/4 of this ripoff; it's just standard ingredients- not quick, not in a container to nuke or heat- divided up into 12 little boxes; look down and read all the cooking directions and it does say add milk but not up front about the product"
3,Really Heavy,"As far as taste goes, Annie's is a good option. However, I found that I could not eat a lot of this Mac and Cheese because the rice pasta is so heavy on the stomach. It left me feeling almost too full and a bit uncomfortable."
4,very delicious,"I USUALLY MAKE THIS WHEN IM CRAVING FOR A QUICK SNACK OR A YUMMY SIDE DISH. YOU CAN HARDLY TELL IT IS GLUTEN FREE BECAUSE IT TASTE SO GOOD. I GET KIND OF BORED WITH THIS AFTER EASY IT VERY OFTEN FOR THE PAST MONTH, BUT NO DOUBT, IT IS A DELICIOUS FOOD PRODUCT AND IS EASY TO MAKE. GREAT FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE ALLERGIC TO WHEAT."
4,Very good,"I was pleasantly surprised when I tasted this mac and cheese. My daughter had tried several and this one she finally enjoyed. It's nice for her to feel like she's eating ""regular"" mac & cheese like before celiac's disease. It's great to have on hand for nights you need a quick meal."
4,Good Mac & Cheese!,"I was very happy to eat some gluten free mac & cheese.It was good, but I didn't boil it long enough so it was chewy.The cheese sauce had good flavor. Yummy!"
3,"Good for toasting, not for cooking","It's a cool toaster, but there's no temperature settings for cooking. If you're in the market for a toaster, it's a cool one. But if you want to cook other small stuff....look for one with temperature settings."
3,Somewhat disappointing,"I bought this toaster oven because it seemed so practical in design, and I do like the fact that it takes up very little counter space. However, it will not toast 4 normal slices of bread at one time without overlapping the pieces, which I could not anticipate from the picture, and it toasts darker on the bottom of the bread slice than on the top. Also, there is a learning curve for setting the dial to achieve the amount of toasting you want, and the toaster does not turn off automatically when the door is opened. If you over-estimate the toasting time you want and have to pull the bread out before the oven is finished working, you risk burning yourself on the still hot elements."
4,Nicely designed workhorse,"We too have had this same little toaster for about 10 years, and it gets more use than any other appliance on our countertop. (...)"
4,A great toaster.,"This space saving toaster oven works great. What I really like about it is the fact that it takes up about the same space as our two slice toaster, just a little taller. The toaster produces nice bagels, toast, and english muffins. The only thing that we had to get used to was that once you have toasted something the time for the next piece of toast is a little shorter, which would make sense since it is hot at that point. Other than that reminder, this unit is worth every penny."
2,Product discontinued and replacement parts no longer available,"The handle broke of my silver Sanyo space-saving toaster oven.After five phone calls to find the ""right people"" they have discontinued the product and there are no handles available for replacement. The toaster is hardly used and now don't feel the product is worth another 50.00.Feel also that given the reputation of Sanyo, their customer service department left me feeling they could have cared less. If that's the way they conduct business for not only this product then I suspect the blasse level of disconcern may impact other products under their label."
3,Carey,I like the product it performs nicely. If it needed any improvement it would be that it would turn off when the door is opened.
5,The bar's scene,"I'd like to know the name of one of the ""external"" songs. I'ts not on the soundtrack cd. I'ts the track played in the bar's scene, when Tommy (Billy Crudup) and john (Ron Eldard), kill Nokes (Kevin Bacon).PLEASE!!!!of anybody knows, answer as soon as possible!!!thanx a lot!Moacyr - Brazil"
1,I hate flats... :(,"I ordered 2 of these for my mountain bike as I'm constantly picking-up thorns or other flat causing things. I run inserts in my tires as well as reinforced tires but thought I'd try these tubes on top of the normal precautionary measures. Within a week they were leaking air! After taking the tube off I realized these suffer from a common flaw other reinforced tubes have where the rubber separates at the base of the presta valve. I don't believe they can be reliably patched or repaired at that point so are essentially junk. I bought two of these and they both had the same problem although one lasted a little while longer. Ultimately, pre-filled self sealing tubes are the best route I've found. These are a waste of time and money. I'm not sure why the rubber separates where it does - made in China cheap rubber, design? I don't know - they just don't work for long."
2,The valves just broke off,I've had two of these tubes go flat on me for seemingly no good reason at all. In both cases the metal valves separated from the rubber tube causing the tube to go flat immediately. This occurred after less than 4 months of use. I would not recommend these tubes. I have another one of these tubes fitted on my back tire currently and I plan to replace it before my next bike ride.
2,"A lot of fun, but doesn't last long","With in two days of using this toy for our dogs, it stopped working."
2,pinches your fingers,This stool can easily pinch your fingers when closing. Requires two hands to open. We're returning it.
2,"Looks okay, but arrived broken","I looked around and thought this was a good deal. Luckily, Amazon has a great return policy because it was broken when I got it out of the box. It only has two pieces, but one side of the lid was not attached and the piece wasn't in the box."
4,Specifications for Commercial Interiors,"This is a fabulous book and a must for any professional interior designer to have on their book shelf. The information it contains provides the designer with the basic information needed to evaluate the different types of building and furniture finishes. It covers all of the available types of finishes including floors, walls, and ceilings. The only concern that I have regarding this book is that it is from 1989 and a lot of changes have happened to the industry since that time. Hopefully, the author is in the process of revising it."
5,beautifully written text,"How wonderful to find a textbook that is not only factually detailed but so clearly written that ---believe it or not---I could hardly put it down. I do wish there were new supplements---it's a treasure. I teach at Pratt Institute's Interior Design Dept., and have assigned it as optional reading and am considering it as assigned reading. The line drawings and illustrations are useful and the sample documents and forms exhaustive."
3,Only if you want the set,The first is always the best. After that the movies gose down hill. but if you are like me and need the compleat set it is worth it.
1,starship troopers and Panasonic DMP-BD50K,"I have bought blu-ray disks starship troopers 1-3 collection. On my player has not play any disk. I have written the letter on Amazon.com. They have sent at once me replacement (Thank's Amazon!). disks 2 and 3 working, 1 does not work again. It only at me or someone else has faced this problem?"
2,"Starship Troopers 1, 2, 3","Volume two and three were not as good as volume one, but were still worth watching."
1,Starship Troopers Disk 1 and Sony BD450,"Ordered this set, and disc 1 would not load, but 2 & 3 would. Returned set, and got a replacement, same issues.My Sony player has all the latest firmware updates, and I have never had a loading issue problem with ANY other disc.I feel the same as others, the first movie was good, the 2nd and 3rd were a complete waste of time."
5,Troopers,Movies are good. First and third one are the best. Second one moves kind of slow thru entire movie.
1,Not what I thought,"I thought I was getting a decorating book, but this turned out to have lots of ditsy crafty projects. (And I am not a crafter.) If you want cottage-style decorating, don't buy this book."
4,There are much better versions,"The very best version I know on CD is Kirill Kondrashin....Nothing compared to this version, very acceptable on DVD. The voices are ok, the orchestra is ok...But you don't have Nina Firsova as in Kondrashin's version. She's more than awesome.Martin"
3,Product peels off and doesn't look great,"I don't think this product is anywhere near as good as the advertisements and magazine recommendations make it sound. I do love that it dries instantly, but it peeled off my nails the same day I put it on. Obviously, this doesn't look very good. I got it free when I bought a lip gloss. I definitely wouldn't pay full price for it."
5,The Indigo,This cd by The Indigo is priceless. Any japanese soft rock or anime fan should purchase it for it quality.
2,Plastic means delicate,"Worked great, motor seemed fine...although i was not a heavy user. I bought it at costco for 60$, much cheaper than Frontgate or elsewhere. I am frustrated now that the 1$ plastic part that holds the motor head to the pole - tore apart i guess from the tilting and oscillation over time. Call customer service - press 1 for support and it says ""goodbye""....thanks Customer NoService"
1,"Windchaser Products, Inc. is TERRIBLE!","The plastic ring keeping the protective cover on my WindChaser fan broke, so I went to their website in an attempt to replace the part - BIG MISTAKE! I called their listed number and left TEN messages with ""Tech Support,"" Customer Service,"" Accounting, AND the Operator. NOBODY ever answered the phone and NOBODY ever returned a call! I sent two e-mails to ""custserv@windchaser.com"" but guess what? NOBODY ever answered them! If this company isn't already in Bankruptcy or otherwise ""Out of Business"", they should be!"
2,"Cheaply made, requires lots of repairs and maintenance","Take a cheaply made oscillating fan and add 4 nozzles with a crummy hose connection and you have the ""Windchaser"". On the plus side, through lots of trips to the hardware store for new hose connections and other parts I have been able to keep this fan going for 2 seasons. I suggest you look elsewhere for a good misting fan."
3,Windchaser fan,"This was a disappointment. All plastic construction, plastic fan blade. I wanted this more as an outdoor fan for non-misting purposes. Fan output was weak. I returned the windchaser and purchased the Holmes outdoor fan, much more attractive on the deck, fan output tremendous, all metal construction, metal blade, less expensive."
5,Summer Breeze,"Loved this product, made my summer cool and refreshing, with or without the mist. Highly recommended."
1,Breaks very quickly,"This fan is very poor quality. I bought it last year and the part that rotates the fan broke the second use. So the fan just droops without moving. So we used it very little. Now the electric plug makes a loud loise and the fan will only operate on low speed. No idea what caused that. I'm now afraid to use it, even if I could stand the noise, so it is garbage."
3,A really big white plastic fan,I'm glad I read the all the reviews. Thanks to the person who suggested cranking the water pressure full throttle to get the misters to atomize better. It actually works -- but watch out if the end thread breaks apart from the force. It's easily corrected by rethreading the mister tube and making sure that it locks into place with the thread that attaches to the hose.Not a strong fan and gee -- it's awfully white. Still trying to figure out where to place it on the deck so that it's not an eyesore.But not bad for the price. And of course -- after I buy this -- I now see that Holmes makes a nicer looking mister fan with a cover. Isn't that the way.
2,AN AVERAGE WORKOUT,"I am an aerobics instructor and have been one for 9 years. I purchased this video thinking I would get some great ideas for my kickboxing classes, as well as a great home workout. I was very disappointed. I have all of the Tae Bo tapes, as well as some Jennifer Steele, Aaron Langford and Kathy Smith tapes. The people in the video need instruction, themselves, on proper technique. I was so concerned that the girl in the front row was going to hurt herself because of improper technique that I found it hard to get a good workout, myself! For a good, safe and effective kickboxing workout, I would highly recommend the Kathy Smith Aerobox video over this one."
2,they forgot the harpsichord,I was very disapointed with these cd's. I got them instead of Pinnock just because so often the violin concertos are tacked on to Bach recordings and I already had Grumiaux and was satisfied. But the harpsichord is so thin it is merely an ornament and relativily unimportant. I ended up going back for Pinnock. This might not be a bad background Christmas cd though.
4,Comfortable and versatile,For the price it is good quality. I like the fact that it can clip to your pants or can be used with buttons. The straps are a little hard to adjust but they are adequate for every day use.
4,Fun Game,"We had played this game last Christmas, I looked for a year to find it. It is a lot of fun and a great Ice-breaker."
5,A Star Wars Fan,"This toy is so cool. My Anakin Skywalker(hanger duel) and my Obi-Wan Kenobi (coruscant chase) fit in real good, but my Anakins arm somtimes falls off but if you put it in the right position it doesn't fall off. Overall, I would recomend this toy to anyone who has the right action figures. I think It's a great toy."
2,Anikan's Speeder,"The thing about this speeder is BOTH Obi-wan and Anikan are supposed to fit, but their legs aren't in the right position. It's a great for display, but a kid wouldn't want to play with this. I give this toy a 2/5"
1,Th Memphis Belle: A story of a Flying Fortress,"This DVD was a duplicate of a DVD Memphis Belle that I paid a total of $3.98 for. This DVD was of very poor quality, could not navigate on theDVD player even though the cost was higher than the above mentioned $16.47. Every effort I made on the Amazon website to return this product was unsuccessful. I was very unhappy with this purchase."
3,Good historical documentry.,"A good historical documentry with good action scenes. The quality of the films, being very old, were very grainy. A good to watch once, but question repeat viewing."
1,Terrible,"Terrible movie, a few brief flash nudity which was more crude than anything. Main actress Really dumb people. Not enough hot cheerleaders. It was a bad camp film with enough jerks to go around. Most teen movies you like at least one person, I didn't like anyone in the entire film no one was the under dog and the love interest wasn't special."
1,Discusting!,Hated it!! My opinion.. Was one of the worst movies i have ever seen.. It seems like all it was about was naked to semi naked girls.. I get sick of movies like this that seem to have girls in skanky wear or naked (soft porn) to get good ratings and this one had A LOT of those scenes. Well it doesn't appeal to me at all.
2,"OKAY, BUT NOT REALLY WORTH YOUR TIME...","Did I read the right reviews on this book?? Bought it based on the reviews and was very dissapointed. The stories were lame and unrealistic. The romance, so-so. I attempted to read each story and was so bored I ended up skimming through most of the book. Don't waste your time, there are alot better romance novels out there to read that will not put you to sleep!!"
3,More does not necessarily mean better,"This recording sounds less like the Boston Pops and more like 101 Strings. (That's not a compliment.) In fact, I know there are better performances of each one out there. These are actually all pleasant, familiar pieces which I like. I'm not at all sure they should all be on the same album. If you want background music while you're reading, or making love, this is perfect. If you're driving late at night and trying to stay awake, not so good! In short, the sum is less than the total of its parts. But I'm giving it a 3, because I do like most of the individual pieces, and I never give more than 4."
1,no music,You have a comment space for those that have listened to the music on this cd and there is no hypertext to allow one to listen to the cd. How can one evaluate the cd if you cannot listen to it?
1,Useless,This is a totally useless book for practical use. It is only good for university research or if you are in the university. It does not help in solving practical day to day ventilation problems. The Industrial Ventilation Manual is 100 times better for practical use. I returned the book within one day of receiving it. Don't bother spending your money.
2,item not as seen in picture,"curtains came w/o the apple embroideries at the bottom. curtains came as two parts, not as show in the pic."
4,Catholic,This product really brought me closer to God. It has special inserts to help Catholic Children understand their faith. I read it every night.
4,Great for Starters,I am a model railroader who wanted to leran more about the equipment used to maintain and repair the real life railroads. If that the type of information your lpooking for this book is excellent.
1,Thumbs down.,"I get so frustrated when hearing this soundtrack. I really liked the movie, but without the visual aspects, the song edits on the CD are really disappointing. In the movie, they kept hyping the masterful skill required in order to play the Rach 3. But when you hear this soundtrack, you realize that the Rach 3 was never played in entirety throughout the movie. The song was edited at its best moments. Many of the other songs in the CD were also truncated and cut. This CD was a real waste of my money."
2,"Great content, MANY production flaws, pops, and cracks",I love the choices on this OST however the many flaws make it almost unplayable. Dropouts and pops any scattered throughout this cd starting 3 seconds into the first track. The last track just cuts off like a tape running out. My replacement cd is just like the first one. It's hard to believe they let this go out the door.
5,A Thirsty Beast,"I can't claim much previous experience with dehumidifiers, but this one did the job, and did it well. I used this thirsty beast to help suck up the excess water of a truly gross basement flood, and it made a big difference in the clean-up and with the general air quality. The set-up was simple, the 30-pint container was substantial, and there were no mechanical failures of any kind, in spite of the fact that I ran the dehumidifier pretty much non-stop.Obviously, if you've suffered a huge amount of water damage, or you're living in the middle of a swamp or something, you'll want to think about a larger model, but I strongly recommend this brand."
2,Same problem as F.Baez,"I purchased this dehumidifier over two months ago and it has not worked at all. Customer service has told me more than once that my replacement 'humidistat' would be delivered in two weeks. I am still waiting, it has been eight weeks.My advice would be to do business with another company or find another product elsewhere."
3,A good heater...BUT....,It worked good for one winter with daily on and off usage. I used it a few times this fall and then one of the 750 watt settings and the turbo fan just stopped working. I guess it was good while it lasted. I doubt if I will buy this brand of heater again.
5,"Insightful, thought-provoking, Twerski stimulates again","Rabbi Dr. Abraham J. Twerski has the uncanny ability of saying timeless messages in new, profound ways. ""Twerski on Spirituality"" is no different. You don't have to be religious to read it and have it be meaningful. It is not a heavy tome weighing you down with vast ideas that are too lofty for mere mortals. Rather, it is easy to read, to taste, to dip into and put down and pick up again. Keep it nearby. You will pick it up time and time again."
3,"Very good book, here are additional suggestions","This product, ""Gotta Get Signed"" is a wonderful addition to any artists library. I would also suggest getting audio products that you can use to have professional songs, like the CD ""Heat Beats Vol 1"" or similar products."
5,Big and Powerful,"What a great buy! Has it all, popcorn key, quick timer, and even has a child lock and more or less key. Very easy to clean also. Can boil water in about 2 minutes. Big enough inside to fit a turkey if you wanted. Don't let this one get away!"
3,Cute Little Pink Razr Cover,"It's cute, it snaps on, it's leather, it's pink. That's it. It protects the outside. nicely.. except the window and the camera piece.The pocket clasp piece snaps on great to the phone piece.. that's awesome, but if it doesn't stay clasped to your POCKET.. then it's useless. which is what has been happening to me. I have to take a pliers to it every night to tighten it for the next day. But does any one of those plastic pocket clips ever last? I don't know.. I was expecting it to last longer.. since it said it was a motorola razr one.it does NOT cover anything on the inside of your phone, so if you're looking for something to protect your screen or keys.. this is not the product for you. It is a nice strong cover. I don't worry about it coming off.So read your reviews.. and search for what you're looking for before you buy.. that's my lesson for you!"
1,Razr cover,I did not like the product because to charge the phone I had to take the cover off. It was not what I thought it was.
1,Needs Warmth,"I bought this for my boat, located in Florida. It is small and quiet, however, it is not effective as the temperature drops. It is best, according to its specs, at 86 degrees F. Well, at that temp I have the AC on to dehumidify and cool. As the temperature drops below 80 it works less and less to the point of being useless at 60 degrees. Even with optimal conditions, do not expect it to dehumidify a boat. It is too small."
2,windchaser,It never worked from the day I got it. I should have sent it back.but was lazy about repacking it.
1,It is useless after a few months,Wanted to give it no stars but that wasn't an option...I purchased one...worked great and quietly for about 6 months...it died...they replaced it for about 1/2 the cost...that one died after about 3 months. Tried a third time...it died...I learned my lesson! It's not worth the money or hassle.
1,Broke in 4 weeks,I would not recomend this to the junk yard. As a matter of fact i would give it a negative 5 stars. And not returnable!!!!!! AMAZON.com is scamming people with this one!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2,Defective product - Indifferent customer service,"My first Windchaser Mini Dehumidifier died after 6 weeks. After sending the people at Windchaser my purchase receipt and a ten dollar replacement fee, they sent me a replacement mini dehumidifier. This second dehumidifier died after 3 weeks. Once again, I sent the people at Windchaser my proof of purchase and waited to receive my replacement dehumidifier--hopefully one that wasn't defective. Two months went by with nary a word. After repeated emails to customer service asking where my replacement dehumidifier was, someone from Windchaser wrote back to say ""If I see your proof of purchase, it'll get done. Otherwise, it won't."" That's it--end of message. As of this date I have not received a replacement for the faulty dehumidifier, nor have I received any further word from ""customer service.""Unless you want a lot of headaches from faulty products and rude customer service, I suggest buying another product."
5,"Love, love love!!!","I love this little guy, so smooth and easy to handle....just enough oil comes out for cooking, a nice stream, no mess and easy to store in cupboard or on counter without taking too much room. Beautiful design. would definately buy as a gift or a relacement if , dare to say , anything disastrous happened to mine."
2,Small!,Not really worth the money--maybe $5 tops--considering it's so small. Still it seems like a perfectly fine product. I recommend really jamming the stopper on there so it doesn't fall out when you pour it (sort of grind/twist it down).
4,The little dripper:,"This cruet does what I had hoped....allows drops of oil to exit in a controlled fashion, takes up little space and is of a pleasant design. Not 5 stars because I bought two and one is much slower, almost blocked, though it works."
3,"Loved, but didn't love us back","I loved this saucer so much. It was the most expensive one and it had the most things to play with. We put it togther and had such a hard time pulling our 5 month old out of it. So we had it for 3 weeks and the book part started only making the chime noise non-stop. So we had to turn it off. We tried everything. We called Babies R Us and were able to return it and get another one. We were so excited, our daugther loved it. Long story short, it took one week this time and the same problem happened again. We are so sad, but don't feel like returning it for a second time. We shouldn't have to keep doing this. :( Hope others don't have this problem. It would be a great toy if it worked."
2,Be Careful,"Be careful using this once your child is comfortable standing for long periods of time. My son really likes this bouncer. He was bouncing in it this morning and managed to fly out and landed on the floor. Luckily, he wasn't hurt. He pushed down on the top and bounced at the same time, he was able to get enough leverage that he ended up vaulting out of it. The bouncer didn't even tip over, he just flew out of it."
4,Turtle and Apple Malfunction?,"Does anyone know what the toy bar says when the turtle is pulled three times? The first time the turtle is pulled, the electronic voice from the toy bar says ""circle""; the second time ""yellow""; but we cannot recognize what the electronic voice says the third time the turtle is pulled? Maybe our toy bar is defective. Also, is the apple suppose to make a sound when it is operated? We suspect that it does since it has what appears to be speaker holes on the back of it; but our apple is silent."
5,Best Buy,I purchased this for my son when he was 4 months old. He is now 7 months and still enjoys it. It is the best money I have ever spent!! He loves it and it keeps him entertained long enough for me to get some things done. It was so easy to put together. It cost more than the others but in my opinion it is worth it.
4,The dye of one of the toys comes off.,"I want to start by saying that I love this toy and my six month old baby also does. However I must say that I had a problem with it. The dye of one of the toys that comes attached to the book with music comes off when it gets wet. My daughter was chewing the toy (the one that looks like a sun or a flower with purple petals) and her shirt and face got purple. I called the company and they told me that the dye used is not toxic but I still didn't like the idea of my daughter swollowing this ink plus the clothing got dirty. I had to cut this particular toy from the book since the company sent me another one and it had the same problem.Overall the toy is very entertaining with lots of activities. (Some of the toys are a little bit pointy but I don't think they are dangerous, though)."
1,warning! babies have to be able to sit up on their own,"i received this as a gift for my 4 1/2 month old who can hold up his head pretty well and is attempting to pull himself up, but not yet sitting unassisted. we put him in this exersaucer and he immediately fell forward and hit his face on the edge of the padded seat. i read in consumer reports that babies should not be left in this exersaucer for more than 5-10 minutes at a time because it can cause their back to compress and grow crooked. also, babies should really be more like 8 months old before put being put in it. the box says 4 months and up but the directions (in an inconspicuous place) say baby must be able to sit up on his own."
4,One of the favorites,"My mom talked me into buying a saucer when our daughter was 3 1/2 months old! She bought the LeapFrog saucer which was great and she loved but my husband and I wanted to buy a different one for our house. We tried out and looked at alot of different ones and finally decieded this would be good,we were convinced my mom had bought the best one! At first our daughter was almost overstimulated by it but now that she is 4 1/2 months old she loves it!! She now plays in this one better than the leapfrog one! It has so much to do and so much to look at, not to mention it has grown with her better! She finds something new on it almost everyday! We still love the leapfrog one but if you are looking for an activity center that will grow with them this is the one!!"
4,Great investment!,"I was looking for an exersaucer because my 5 month old seemed to be getting bored with his Jumperoo. I thought he would like this one because of all the sounds it makes and all the activities. At first he wasn't sure of it, but after dicovering everything on it, he loves it! However, it doesn't bounce like the Jumperoo, so he likes that better. But, this was a nice change for him. If you already have a Jumperoo, then your child probably won't like this better, but if you have the means it's good to have to keep a little variety."
4,Exersaucer Entertainer Review,"I give it a 4 stars because my daughter seams to love it. The only thing that I wish it did was turn in to a walker, so that way it would grow with her. Other wise we love it."
4,great for our 5 month old,"Our 5 month old loves this exer-saucer. We turn him around when he gets sick of one of the toys and he has a whole new world to explore on the other side of the exersaucer. We have to put a towel in the seat with him because it's too big for him right now. The only thing is that he tries to put all the toys in his mouth and some of them don't have a long enough tether for him to get in his mouth (probably for safety reasons). He gets frustrated with that, but we just move him another 90 degrees and he has other toys to play with. This will probably be more fun as he gets older and he can reach further."
4,Good for keeping baby occupied when you need a few moments,"We first used this when our son was 4 months or so. The number of toys was overwhelming to him then. But by six months he enjoyed playing in it and he was thrilled when he figured out how to make the apple pop up and back down.For us, it was useful for ages 6-11 months. We mainly used it as a means to occupy our son when we needed a few moments to get something done - to take a shower, to do something on the computer, to complete a household task. For 10-20 minutes at a time, our son was safe and occupied in this exersaucer. We were satisfied with the product."
5,Good entertainment,"We bought this 4 years ago for my older son - he was almost too old for it then, and only got a couple months' use out of it (and preferred a jumperoo). But my 8-month-old twins both love it - they started using it around 5-6 months, and both still love it enough that I can leave them there happily for enough time to get something done! The various noises things make aren't particularly grating (relative to some toys, anyway - anything that bugs me too much ""breaks"" pretty quickly at our house.)I'd estimate the age range for this as, maybe, between 4 months to crawling (maybe 11 months?)"
2,Sound Effects Way Too Loud,There are two sound settings on the little learning table - one is way too loud (could easily damage your babies ears) and the other setting is way too low (can't hear it at all).
3,FDA Approved?,"There are many products in the market that advertised many wonderful things. Are the promises delivered? That's why I haven't bought this product. How do I know if this product is or is not harmful? Most of us consumers have no knowledge about scientific theories or facts of this product. Have you tried those diet pills? You know what I'm talking about. I will not buy anything like this unless they're approved by FDA or any reputable organization. Why RISK your health and spend hard earned money on something that you're not certained about it. Do your research before you buy it, or wait until this product is tested by a reputable organization not just some independent labs."
2,MINE BROKE TOO!,"I was a little wary when I saw so many reviews saying that their lotus broke down. However, I liked the concept so much I thought I would roll the dice. Sure enough, MINE BROKE TOO!The company sent me a new one and so far after three uses it is still alive. I'll keep my fingers crossed."
2,THE LOTUS,"Just like a previous reviewer, I really wanted to love this product. I purchased it and tried it for the first time with the spray bottle suggested by the company. I got the F1 reading when it got to 98%. I then tried it 2 or 3 more times but got the same result. I sent it back and a few days later I got my replacement.Unfortunately, the same thing happened again. I am so disappointed, but I guess its best it happened now instead of after the warranty ran out."
3,I love this product when it works,"I love the product. I use it to take stains out of the cloth, clean the kitchen, clean the refrigerator, etc. I also used it to clean my dry clean only clothing. You can spray the collar and will save you from some of the trips to the dry cleaner. The only problem is the F1, we finally figured out you can not use the water from the tap, you need to use filtered water or distilled water. That eliminated the F1 problem, this is after I took 3 units back to the Sharper Image. My 4th unit got an F5 another return. I believe they went to market a little bit too early, they will fix the problems and then I will give the 5*s"
2,Did not work with tap water in San Francisco,"I'm going to repeat what a previous reviewer said: it is possible that you're going to need filtered/bottled water for this to work.I got the F1 code with only tap water in the spray bottle a bunch of times. I found trouble shooting instructions on the website that said to try bottled water for at least two cycles (first cycle to clean out the sensor).I did and BAM! Worked great. The processed water was also fantastic on a couple of stains that I tested it on. I tried tap water again, and it still didn't work. At this point the website tells you to forever use filtered or bottled water.I couldn't really be bothered to set up a water filtration system just to make this appliance happy, so I returned it. Amazon gave me a full refund and didn't charge me for shipping.If you're a patient person, it may be worth a try."
1,Great Idea but poorly implmented,"Who wouldn't want special water to clean with without chemicals? A great idea but in everyday use its temperamental and errors out frequently. In the year and a half I've owned it it's probably worked three months. The company has replaced it three times but each unit failed within weeks. Finally they offered an out-of-warrantee replacement if I sent back the unit at my cost and gave them another $39.99. If it were a new version then maybe but I don't want to be having the same conversation in three weeks about out of warrantee replacement. I'd wait for the next version. This one I'm throwing in the trash, along with the mop!"
2,does it's job but breaks,looks like everyone has the F3 issue with this. according to the manual it says F3 error occurs when a the bowl/spray bottle is moved from its place but i did no such thing and i made sure that the spray bottle was firmly in place. shame on tersano (which came up with a great concept) for such poor quality control. and shame on sharper image for not doing their homework and retailing this shoddy machine. i give it 2 stars cus it did do its job for the first 15 minutes i had it.
4,problem with the cartridges,I would deffinitely buy this unless there were replacement cartridges. I read in a review that one catridge lasts for 3 months.It would be a financial disaster to be have to order 30 dollar cartridge and the shipping cost etc.If you improve the product to work without any replacement please let me know. it would be a magic to clean everything with just one device.
1,"Didn't work long, and never for some things","I purchased this with high hopes. At first it worked pretty well on everything but strawberries and grapes. I think I got a cycle to finish on a batch of strawberries once...ever. Maybe a couple times with grapes. Yes, I tried bottled water. Yes, I ran it through multiple cycles (up to 10). It just would not work on those two things.Now, at 1.5 years old and rarely used in the last 6 months, it works on nothing. I'm ready to toss it or give it to Goodwill. I spent the money to join an organic CSA for this summer."
1,It was great while it lasted,"I bought one and liked it a lot. It was everything it was said to be, but then it broke after a month. The company replaced it with a reconditioned unit. That one worked for about six months and then broke. Now I've given up. Too bad. It was nice while it lasted.Update: I like it so much when it was working that I bought one for my mother. That one broke too. She used it once or twice and put it away. When I tried it, it was broken."
1,Works well WHEN it works,This is a potentialy good product but it just has too many glitches and because it's so new customer service is amateur. Still very small production and a lot of tweeking going on. The filters are a joke and don't last even 25% as long as they say. They are also very expensive. I won't buy another for at least 3 years. Maybe they will have their stuff in order by then.
3,Interesting story about Grant,This book dragged on at times but overall kept my interest. I found it interesting that Grant was as famous worldwide as he was. The book gave a good insight into the man's personalit
2,Disappointing,"When I picked this book up, I thought it was a great find. I read a great deal of non-fiction of this type, and the opening pages were very promising. But I ultimately found it disappointing, even offensive. Trienens sinks the book in legalistic detail, focusing so much on the civil suit that he loses sight of the fascinating larger story. Worse, he seems to regard the Goodmans -- descendants of the owner who died in the Holocaust -- as little more than opportunists, and displays little sympathy or respect for their family's tragedy. And while he claims to be taking an objective view, over and over he interprets facts in a light most favorable to the defendant in the suit -- his client. This book is a badly missed opportunity. I would love to see someone else do it again."
5,4.5 stars from Jayo,"Jayo is back after 1 year and 3 months since his 2nd classic album (""Whatcha Gonna Do"") with one that is ""only"" 4.5 stars. Only 8 songs on this one, 2 have guests on them. As usual, he has great production that is straight west coast, provided from DJ Silk I believe: and his great unique flow that only he can pull off like he does. No producers or track listing credits are given on any of the songs however. Out of the 8 songs you get a lot of quality. No weak tracks. 1 classic, 1 almost classic, 1 ok song and the others are mostly great songs. A must have rap album especially for fans of Bullet Loco.#2 - 9 (good relaxing beat -- about fighting instead of shooting your problems away)#3 - 7.5 (f/ Du Low Gang)#4 - 8#6 - 10 (CLASSIC w/ great upbeat production)#7 - 9 (another good beat)#8 - 9 (good beat -- f/ Kam & Money Green)#9 - 9 (nice beat again)#10 - 9.5 (great beat)James Savage - b. around 1973 -- San Diego, CAcheck all my reviews"
4,Could be better,"The pale Wendell is Springfield's most motion-sick child - never far from a barf bag. Poor Wendell. He comes with a pile of books, a banana, an apple, an orange and a barf bag with barf stains.Like his cartoon counterpart, he looks very pale, but not quite pale enough. I'm not sure I'd recognize him without the barf bag - a well done action figure, but not up to the same ""realism"" as the other Simpson figures produced by Playmates."
5,A very practical guide to start a business in Dubai,"This book offers a step-by-step guide to set-up and run a business in Dubai. It is very helpful for those who intend to establish and operate a company in Dubai. This guide, written in a plain english language, helps make a lot of money and time saving in the company's formation process. I really recommend it."
2,can't get past the photos,"The content is okay--how to do buttonholes and interfacing-- but nothing revolutionary...same as all the other ""couture secrets"" books (if you've read ""The Entrepreneur's Guide to Sewn Product Manufacturing,"" you will know that these couture ""secrets"" are kind of a farce, since the designers by legal contract cannot reveal their so-called ""secrets""). Although the book is published in the 90s, the photos and examples are like a bad revisit to the 80s...can we say vests and big hair? As a result, I couldn't see myself directly applying any of the techniques."
1,Abhorrent Advice,"Telling a mother to limit breastfeeding to the ""duration of her maternity leave"" and that this short term nursing is good enough ignores medical facts and condescends to mothers and women in general.The guilt does not come from feeling bad about breastfeeding or stopping, it comes later when moms realize that they failed to get the advice and support they needed to breastfeed while they returned to work.Medical professionals truly well-versed in infant and pediatric nutrition would never counsel healthy mothers to shorten the duration of breastfeeding. These authors fall far short. Get Sears' or Newman's books instead.Jay Gordon, MD, FAAP"
3,Interesting but...,"I think it is ridiculous that this author assumes any working woman in the US gets 3 months leave. Even it you are lucky enough to have paid leave, it is often only 6 weeks long, half the time recommended in this book.The idea that something is better than nothing is good, but it just ignores the real issue: that women aren't allowed even a minimum of time home to establish breastfeeding and that companies are so unyielding about not allowing new mothers to have breaks in order to pump."
1,This book was not helpful to me,"I bought this book expecting it would give practical advice about transitioning from breastfeeding at home while on maternity leave, to going back to work and pumping. But that was not the message at all. It turned out to be 200+ pages of ""do whatever works for you and don't let anyone else make you feel bad about it."" Not the worst advice ever but who needs to buy and read a whole book about that? I also felt patronized by the message that pumping at work would be too hard and I shouldn't bother trying. Helpful advice would have been information about employment laws regarding a woman's right to take breaks to express milk, information about which states ban public breastfeeding, reviews of different models of pumps and their advantages/drawbacks, etc. This sort of information was not in the book."
1,Bad Investment,"Complete waste of money. I wish I kept the box so I could have returned it to Wal-mart. This rack started rusting within three weeks after using. The rust has gotten on some of my dishes. And just as the other reviewers have already mentioned, the stupid pan has no drain! Very poorly engineered product. I bought this dish-rack thinking it would look nice in my new house. Avoid at all costs!"
3,Not the best stainless,"This dish drainer is a knockoff of similar and more expensive ones made from heavier guage stainless. The stainless is particularly thin on the underside of the rack near the utensil bin. As a result, rust stains formed on the bottom tray shortly after I started using it. I placed small clear plastic suction cups on both sides of the bottom tray at that end to keep the rack out of direct contact with the tray and water. This seems to help.The rack has a good capacity. The water in the tray does not drain, but usually evaporates completely overnight. This will entail some occasional cleaning of the tray if you want to keep it looking spiffy."
5,Great stroller,"This stroller is a ""heaven sent""..... my husband uses it to take our 26mo jogging with him. The stroller has a smooth ride and it is very ""user friendly"" We give this stroller 5 stars...."
1,It doesn't fit my mixer,It did not look like the picture. It doesn't fit my mixer even though the model number was listed. I can't send it back because one of my kids trashed the box it came in.
5,much better than the one I recieved with the mixer!,"This wire whip mixes all the ingredients! The one I received with the mixer did not mix it in around the bottom of the bowl, which was no fun.Jesus' Blessings and Peace"
1,Globe puzzle falls flat,"A spherical puzzle is a novel idea but fails to live up to its promise. The pieces fit together so poorly that you would NEVER get the puzzle together correctly without cheating - using the numbers on the back of the pieces. Even when cheating it is a challenge to get the pieces to stay together. We assembled it just to prove we could, then promptly put it back in the box to donate to some unlucky soul at the local re-sale shop. Don't waste your money nor your time."
3,"Great oldie, but not with modern hardware","One of my all time favorite PC games. Not fully compatible with modern video subsystems (e.g., drivers, video hardware, etc.) or WinXP. I got it to work intermittently, but the text always displayed as rainbow colored noise. Would frequently crash to desktop, especially during cut-scenes."
1,FALSE ADVERTISING,"Orderd the sitram catering saucier pan and received a professional sauce pan. Tried to have item replaced, but was told the item was out of stock and they would have to refund my purchase. No pot for me, so bad review for them.Check you pot well if you ordered this item. The catering line has a thick copper slab at the base of the pot. You can actually see the copper. And the handle is a flattened piece of solid steal...Not a hollow steel tube."
5,A fine but smelly screen,"This pull-down screen is well made and easy to use. It can be either suspended from the ceiling, ceiling-mounted, or wall-mounted. The metal cover is white. The screen had a very strong paint or glue smell when pulled down for the first few days. This may have been because it was shipped very soon after it was manufactured."
3,Very Relaxing,"We also have the RockABye Baby-The Cure! Highly recommend. I've givien it as a gift to excited expecting Mommys. It's Unique and my son falls asleep with it every night. I ment to give it 5 Stars but when I went back to edit, after saving, I couldn't change it."
3,Not Worth Buying,"When I read The Best Revenge, it kind of confused me. The two main characters were always talking about this money that was stolen. When some progess was made, the money thing came back. The heroine never trusted the hero.There was also a lot of sex from people who were not the main characters. it wasn't romance because the people didn't love or even like eachother. It was just a way of munipulating people for other needs. I thought it was just trashy and unneeded. It was written to give some cheap thrills, but it just grossed me out. I think the book would have done just find without those scenes.I could not tell how or why the two main characters, Dallas and Rae, felt about eachother. They talked in circles. it got really annoying. I don't recommend this book to anyone. Stella Cameron really disappointed me."
4,cops are bull,"Smart low-budget indie with largely unknowns playing cops and robbers, as retired NY detectives try to organize a posse to eliminate drug dealers from their hood. Big mistake! The streets have changed and they have not. The ""Over-the-hill Gang"" meets ""The Godfather"". Good stuff."
3,Good Starter,"I received this book along with the same author's publication""Avionics Troubleshooting and Repair"" seeking to gain the most information on avionics. The ""Avionics Troubleshooting and Repair"" appears to be a newer updated version of this same book although the titles are different. This earlier edition written in 1991, is more compact in both print and overall size. If I had to pick only one it would be the author's newest title mentioned above. The text is easier to read in the newest format. If you are seeking the most knowledge on the subject then both will serve well."
2,does not date well,"I was expecting a book about life along the Mississippi. Nope.This is a book mainly about the steamboats and other craft that plied the Mississippi River. It was written in 1955 by three white guys and you'll howl when you read their bios on the back cover.Ray Samuel is from Mississippi plantation stock.Warren Ogden, as with Samuel, wrote for the New Orleans Times-Picayune and edited some magazine called Dixie.Leonard Huber was a businessman who was an authority on postage stamps of the Deep South.Back in 1955 things sure were different, eh.The book does have some fantastic illustrations and old 1800 and early 1900s photographs but, honestly, don't waste a cent buying this. There's no deep insight to the life and times of the past along the river. The stories read more like something you'd find in, well, magazines of the 1950s.It's Americana, I guess, but I just found the angles all writers took were just too matter-of-fact."
3,Doesn't work for the fridge,I bought 2 of these because others had said that it works for the fridge and the freezer. Yes to the freezer and a big NO for the fridge. It's nice to have this on for the freezer in the event someone doesn't close it all the way and I really wish I could make it do that for the fridge.
4,"It's cheap, but it does the job.",Alarm is clear and loud.The only minus is lack of a magnet. Item like this just cries for a magnet. What did the designers think?
5,Combat Bayonet/Knife--One of the best,"Rarely do I rate a product 5 stars ,however, the Ontario M9 Bayonet is the real deal. As an Army Vet and die heart hunter I only buy what can survive in the toughest conditions. This bayonet is sharp and extremely durable /applicable as a combat hand to hand knife or a solid bayonet for my Mossberg 590A1 Shotgun or on an AR 15 platform. The sheath with the knife works as a wire cutter if needed. If you've been trained to handle/deploy a bayonet this is certainly a top choice/tool you should consider for your TA Gear."
1,A trash can that is a waste to buy,I had a similar one that did not last too long. The mechanism was flimsy it broke easily. I do not expect the quality to be good at the price I bought it.
1,NOT LARGE PRINT!,"This is NOT a large print bible. Unfortunately, I believed the reviews saying this was indeed large print - DON'T BELIEVE IT! I have two other large print bibles and by comparison, the type in the NASB Thinline bible is regular sized print. In fact, the print is so small that I couldn't comfortably read it with my glasses on. Also, I don't know if I got a bad copy, but the words written in red were so pale they were bearly readable. So disappointed in this purchase."
1,Not happy,Some how I got the impression this was for Windows 7. It is NOT. Cannot use it:(It is not for Windows 7 or 64 bit.
2,WOMEN CAN ALSO HAVE AFFAIRS,"Lynn AtwaterThe Extramarital Connection:Sex, Intimacy, and Identity(New York: Irvington Pub., 1982) 263 pagesBased on interviews with women who took loversin addition to being married.The book provides no surprises,but it is interesting to see a phenomenon more often associated with men.Some of the women took female lovers.If you might be interested in more positive results,search the Internet for the following list of good books:""Multiple Loving Bibliography"".James Leonard Park, author ofNew Ways of Loving: How Authenticity Transforms Relationships"
1,Waste of Money,While taking a databases course at college I found online documentation and tutorials to be more helpful and understandable. Very few examples and the examples given were impossible to follow. This book is more mathematical theory than anything else. Not recommended under any circumstances for anything more than a bonfire
2,Has some serious issues,"While in my opinion it is one of the easier textbooks to read, it has some serious flows. Some of the definitions it gives are extremely vague. As a matter of fact the definition for a ""database"" that gives is bordering on being completely wrong. Obviously a serious issue for a textbook with that title. Let's just say no good professor will use this textbook for their class."
1,Not a good buy,"I bought this book for my database course. This book is very dry and boring. Not organzied i.e The author continuously refers to figures that are yet to come (on the next few pages) or figures from chapters ago! This is distracting when reading the book. If you buy this book, hope you have extra time to spend flipping back and forth to view the referenced figures.There are no answers to the excercises in the book..So dont count that helping you understand the ideas presented.But there are examples to explain key points but no follow through on explaining why the answer is what it is.I do not recommend this book."
5,The best english rendition available,"For anyone who enjoys the legends of King Arthur this book is a must read. The story is a blend of commedy, adventure, and the magnificent all set in a world that is at times magical and bordering the superantural. The story contains the tales of two knights; Perceval and Gawain. While it is true that Chretian never did finish the book the result is more of a cliffhanger than a dissapointment. Burton Raffel does an excellent job translating from the origional french using the definative Pleiade edition as his reference. These masterpieces written by Chretian de Troyes are the inspiration behind the famous Le Morte Darthur by Sir Thomas Mallory. Enjoy."
1,I don't know what the other reviewers were thinking!,"Elaine Silver's music is as amateurish as can be. It is obvious she is trying to sound as if she has had voice training, but if she has it hasn't done her a lot of good. Her music itself is overly simplistic in its composition and in no way should anyone who likes Loreena McKennit buy this CD. I am always hoping for good spiritual music, but this is not it!"
2,The Earth is in Pieces,"This puzzle was fun to do, but not as fun as it could have been. I was hoping that the photos chosen for the mosaic were going to be appropriate for the continent/geographic area they were part of. Instead, there were 50+ photos of horses and 100+ photos of airplanes. If you use the picture on the box cover as a guide, you'll be upset to note that it is partly obscured by the box design. If you ignore the box, this puzzle becomes a bit more challenging, but the difficulty is tempered by the fact that the orientation of the pieces is obvious because of the orientation of the constituent photos."
1,Wear very quickly,"These boots are stylish, and I like the quick zip up action, however they aren't a good option if you intend to wear them regularly. I've had them for a little over two months and already the inside liner behind the heel has worn all the way through. Now my heel rubs directly on the hard (metal?) interior surface of the boot is giving me terrible blisters.If this is a ""once-in-a-while"" fashion option, I'd say consider it, however if you plan to walk in them regularly find something else.I'm now stuck with an expensive pair of shoes that I can't wear (after only two months) and it is past Amazon's return window. Overall a pretty negative customer experience."
2,DISSAPOINTING,"KOKANE RELEASED A PRETTY AWFUL DEBUT IN 91 CALLED ""WHO AM I"" ON RUTHLESS RECORDS, BUT RECTIFIED THIS IN 94 WITH HIS UNDERGROUND CLASSIC ""FUNK UPON A RHYME"". I DONT THIMK U CAN BUY THIS ALBUM ANYMORE BUT IF U EVER C IT BUY IT QUICKLY! IT IS ONE OF THE MOST BIZARRE, UNIQUE, FRESH, PSYCADELIC RAP ALBUMS U WILL EVER HEAR.BUT AS 4 THIS NEW ALBUM, I THINK KOKANE HAS LOST IT.THE PRODUCTION SOUNDS PRETTY LOW BUDGET AND KOKAS LACKING ON THE CREATIVITY, AND ALL THE GUEST RAPPERS DONT DO ANYTHING TO HELP IT. MAYBE ITS BECAUSE COLD 187 DOESNT PROVIDE THE BEATS 4 KOKANE ANYMORE.IF YOURE A BIG FAN OF FUNK UPON A RHYME THIS WILL B A BIG LETDOWN, BUT IF YOUVE NEVA HEARD THAT RECORD AND U WANT A KOKANE CD THEN U MIGHT LIKE THIS. SONGS LIKE ""MAJOR PAPERS"" AND ""ON THE GRIND"" ARE PRETTY COOL OVERALL THO THIS IS DISSAPOINTING.BACK TO THE DRAWING BOARD 4 KOKANE."
3,They Call him Mr. Kane!,"This record came out in 1999, and is far from Kokane's strongest CD. It has som great tracks and overall a really good feel to it, but Kokane can do much better than this.That being said I wouldnt have missed it for the world. It features SEVERAL beats by my favourite producer Battlecat (and everyone know Kokane+Battlecat = succes) as well as beats/apperances by DJ Silk, Bad Azz, Tray Dee, Spice1, Short Khop, Too Short and more.I would recommend this cd for tracks 3 and 9 alone, but no matter what it is a must for any Kokane/westcoast fans"
4,Awesome,"Costumes were sexy, can get a little frustrating which I like. I enjoyed it. I wish they would have made a part 2 or added more levels"
4,pretty cool game,"i know the experts gave this game like a mediocre rating or something,but i myself liked it,it has a ""dusk to dawn"" type of feel,and the boss fights was great especially the last guy,i think you should try this game,or at least give it a chance,i did,and i'm glad"
1,Riven: The Sequel to Myst,"In this, one of the most eagerly awaited computer games of all time, the user is shown a truly diverse and intriguing world. As appealing as this may sound, one would never known it. Dealing with the game's lack of involvement and user participation grows tiresome quickly.The concept of point-and-click gameplay, which was revolutionary in Myst's day, is beginning to show its age. Today's games often immerse the player in another world; Riven succeeds in only providing the individual with a multitude of pretty scenes.There may be a fascinating story behind Riven, but it is lost in its clumsy implementation. This title will only appeal to those who wish to show off their fast and new their computers. I surely won't be waiting around another five years for the next installment."
1,Warning to all: runs only on out-of-date systems.,"I can't comment on Riven itself but I can comment on the misleading marketing. I have a Mac operating Mac OS 10 on a PowerPC chip. The system requirements list only ""PowerPC"" as required. But in fact Riven only operates under the ""Classic"" environment which means Mac's running 10.2.6 or LESS. Buyer beware.Same is true on my Dell running Windows XP --Riven only runs on older systems (e.g.,Windows 95). Again, buyer beware."
5,Words don't describe it.,"It's not often that I buy a computer game, much less invest almost $1000 in a computer system so it can run that game. But after seeing myst, I _had_ to see riven. I upgraded video, sound, and downgraded my OS to win95 from linux, just so I could play it. And it was worth it (not to mention I got plenty of puzzle-solving just getting the new sound card, cd drive, etc to all work :-)). Riven is _beautiful_. Amazingly rendered graphics, resolution that makes Myst look shoddy, beautiful and haunting music. Buy the game. You will not regret it. If you have to, upgrade your computer. You will _not_ regret it. This is a game worth putitng up with windows 95 for."
3,My computer wasn't ready for Riven!,"I absolutely love the problem-solving involved with both Myst and Riven, but I was disappointed in Riven. Not by the graphics (hardly!) but by all of the upgrading that must be done. My computer must be really outdated because it takes about 5 mintues to transition when the game is in movie mode! Right now I'm pretty much stuck because I have to click on something at a certain moment, but it takes to long! I guess all the upgrading will be good for the computer, but I must admit I liked Myst slightly better. Maybe because it had more of a story. (Maybe it's just because I couldn't even hear what was being said at the beginning of Riven). So, I guess I'll just hope my computer is upgraded before I lose interest already!"
5,Amazing!,"The creators of this game must be geniuses to create such a masterpiece. The puzzles, the sound, and the graphics are far superior to anything I have ever seen. It's like playing a movie. I can't wait for Cyan, and Red Orb to come out with another sequel. Hopefully, by that time DVD will already be the standard so that we don't have to keep changing discs. Enjoy! :)"
2,Two stars for the graphics - but the game play is impossible,"The graphics on this game are very pretty and make the game seem quite fascinating for the first week or two.After a week or two of playing this game, however, and you will realize you don't have a clue what is going on. Anyone who says they have figured this game out without a guide or less than a year of their life invested playing 8 hours a day is a liar.The game is impossible to figure out unless you are willing to decicate your whole life to it. Period.So if you like a game with neat graphics that you will roam around in for hours on end, clueless as to what is going on, then Riven might be for you.For those with less time I would recommend a game like Grim Fandango, instead of Riven."
1,I have Not recieved my order!!,I ordered this back in July and I have not recieved my CD yet.(This Is Smooth Jazz )...What is going ON!!!????
5,Important Part of History,This book covers a group of little known heros of WWII. While small in number it's importance to the success of the war in the Pacific cannot be measured by it's size. Their contribution cannot be in operations alone as the very existance of the group was a foundation for future units such as theirs. It could even be said that the Special Forces of today might possibly not exist had it not been for the foresight of the founder and the execution of operations of the men of The Alamo Scouts. The book is well written and with plentiful photographs. Their accompolishments are truly astounding.
3,Cilian Murphy rules,The movie is only good because of Cilian Murphy. It is funny and mental. Good movie for a boring day.
2,on the edge,"On the edge was a good plot for a movie. But was poorly acted, and over all poorly done, if you are looking for a good drama, as I said the plot was great, but the acting bore me."
5,Kings of pop is an amazing cd! One of the best this summer,If you liked homegrowns cds in the past then you will love this cd. Every song is catchy and good. My favorites are I love you not and give it up. But the rest are very good. If you havent heard Homegrown before you should check this cd out you wont be dissapointed.
3,Everyone should read,"First off, HomeGrown is in NO WAY a new band!!! Homegrown have been around since 1995! They changed lables in 1998, which is why most of there older cd's show 98 dates on them. Next while ""Kings of pop"" is a realy good cd the reason i gave it only three stars is in comparasin to homegrowns other cds. ""Act Your Age"" is one of, if not the best pop-punk albums of all time. and ""EP Phone Home"" is Homegrowns best cd. To everyone out there who likes simple plan and bowling for soup, and all the new trendy bands, thats cool, but expand your horizons. There are some amazing band out there that don't get exposure on MTV. Some names to check out: Rufio, No Use For A Name, OLD Blink-182, Lagwagon. Yes this is a good cd, but in all honesty this is there worst or second to worst album."
4,Good Puzzles,Lots of fun. Not extremely difficult but addictive. Puzzles get harder as you go. Requires some patience so relax. Worth buying.
3,"OK for the price, but quality suffers","This was my trial to see if a lower price cable would work. Out of the box it was great, but very soon afterward noticeable image quality issues started. There is noise and flickering that should not be there. I will probably end up investing in the monster cable."
1,Beware,"I purchased this item through Amazon. They were great for their part. BUT the part in general was poorly made. One of the ENDS broke off after unplugging it once. Sadly this happened well after any warranty would have helped me. After all, I don't make a habit of pulling out my HDMI cird just for fun! DO NOT BUY BELKIN!"
5,The New Bible on Apologetics.,Everything you ever wanted to know but was too lazy to research. BeHold the New standard. Every Catholic and Protestant should read this book. This might be the catalyst for quenching the cocoon and dictatorship of relativism and pluralism. Catholic Answers have done it again. Great work team
5,"A great book to help ""Cradle Catholics"" grow their faith","This is an excellent book to help one better understand the ""whys"" and ""wheres"" of the Catholic faith. All too often, Catholics ""go through the motions"" without an adult's understanding of their faith. This book is an easy read, very concise, and has a team of great apologists that brought it all together into one book. It's a wonderful way to get your feet wet on the road to building your faith and understanding of the Catholic Church. It has enabled me to better share the beauty of our Catholic Church with those who have misinformation or NO information about the treasures of the 2000+ year old Catholic Church. Every Catholic should have it in their library."
2,Bell Body Ball,"I received the ball and pumping it up was very difficult. I didn't even get the ball pumped up when the foot pumper cracked across the top. Also while pumping, the ball would lose air. The ball took a very long time to pump!"
1,Do NOT buy these skates!,"First time used, they broke and caused me a very hard fall. The back wheels are only being held by a rubber material that is not sturdy enough to turn in. Was on these skates for 20 minutes, taking a turn and the back wheels popped out and took a very hard fall. I suggest you buy a better brand name."
3,the skates,"these skates are great but very narrow so when ordering them use caution if you have a wide foot, I will be awhile breaking these skates in"
2,Pretty but scuffed up,"I purchased my skates, so I could learn to skate with my son. However I would have been in love with them, but my left skate had a scuff mark on it. So I'm not sure if my skates are new or recycle."
3,It gets better with more listening,"Still not spectacular but nonetheless, better than I thought it was at first. If they can tighten up their rhythms and find another vocalist to harmonize with, they have the potential to be excellent, right now, they're merely good.For a good dose of fun, check out that's whyWhen you're through with this, check out some other, oftentimes better twee bands, Heavenly, The Shop Assistants, Wolfie, and The 14 Iced Bears, to name a few"
4,Brother Thermal Portable Printer,Built well prints well. Software works well. If you have the need for small paper output this is the printer for you.
2,"Ok, but not as good as some of the others","If you normally enjoy the Richard Carlson ""Don't Sweat the Small Stuff..."" books, I did find this book somewhat enjoyable. There are some differences from the other ""Don't Sweat"" books. I noticed that it was written ""by the editors of,"" so it isn't actually written by Richard Carlson. The foreward is by Richard Carlson. The main difference I noticed, which was the deal breaker for me, is that this book didn't relate personal stories the way other ""Don't Sweat the Small Stuff"" books do. I think the personal anecdotes in Richard & Kristine Carlson's ""Don't Sweat the Small Stuff in Love"" are what really made that book special and more importantly, relevant. Unfortunately this book lacked that personal touch. Still good general advice."
1,Portacrib,"I was looking to buy a Port-A-Crib mattress.I ended up with a pack n play mattress.Port-A-Crib is a brand name, not a portacrib.Not your fault - fault of the manufacturers or the sellers. They give no size or that their portacrib mattress is for a pack n play.Totally dissatisfied."
1,Beware bait & switch,"I ordered this pan from amazon, and received the 13.5 inch Sitram Profiserie pan, which is a cheaper option without the copper bottom. I complained and they shipped a replacement, and AGAIN I received the Profiserie pan. Beware, Amazon has this item mislabeled, so I would not order it from Amazon."
5,Sitram stainless steel fry pan,"Excellent quality and performance. Even cooking, easy clean-up, and quick heating. Heavy enough not to ""move"" while stirring or loosening pan drippings. And the really nice thing is you don't have to worry about toxins leeching into your food from non stick coatings.I have been most pleased with this pan."
3,Very Heavy,This is a great pan but way too heavy. I'm old. Things aren't as easy to lift anymore. No complaints other then that.
1,Boring and breaks easily,"I bought this clock thinking that Spongebob moved or something when the alarm went off. Anything. But Spongebob does not move at all. He's basically just a cute blob of plastic on top of a treasure chest clock. The vaunted ""snooze button"" on Spongebob only guarantees that Spongebob will break off in a very short time. So now, I have an overpriced radio-alarm clock, and a plastic Spongebob that I can't even give my daughter to play with because of the two very dangerous wire support posts sticking out of the bottom of Spongebob. Save your money and don't buy this!"
5,This book was very helpful and easy to understand,"I enjoyed going to the library and studying this book. This book is easy to understand and helpful. The Math, Reading and the Writing all of it was helpful. I was a little rusty on most of it. This book gave me a quick refresher course in all subjects. I am still a little nervous, but more confident about taking the test. I recommend this book for anyone that is interested in taking the PPST/CBT."
1,Still do not have it!,A stone was missing when I opened the box. I mailed back to exchange and after a month I still do not have the ring.
4,Great Book - poor cover,The book was exactly what I wanted to read for my children and they understood the message and I appreciated the well thought out info. I would recommend this book to all of my friends to explain why Christians should separate ourselves from any appearance of evil. I just wanted to say the only reason I gave this a 4 star is because the front cover was very muted and not as colorful as the pic on Amazon. It looks like the pic has been color copied over and over again. I know when you use a copy to copy over and over again it becomes muted and no longer crisp and clear. As we are all trying to pinch our pennies nowadays I thought for the price it should have been better bound and have a crisper picture. That is my only complaint otherwise I HIGHLY recommend the message in the book.
5,The most entertaining novel I've read in years.,"I haven't even finished the book yet and its really one of the best things I've read in years. I really like Braff's character development and the way he can imcorporate humor into a very realistic portrayl into the complexities of a families relationship. Also working with adolescents, I'm impressed with how true to form the main character is. I'd reccomend this to both kids and adults, its should become a timeless classic piece of American literature."
1,Not as described!,"Be aware that these are 2 1/2""wide x 3"" long x 1"" high. They are very tiny, and it is difficult to think of a practical use for them, unfortunately. I hope Amazon corrects the text to accurately reflect the product."
2,Ill-conceived joystick control,"This stereo sounds great and works fine. But within minutes of having it installed I realized a fatal flaw.The joystick control on the right of the unit is used to control many fuctions and is so poorly designed I don't think the engineers ever did a read-world test before approving it. It works fine when you're parked. However the control is very touchy and pressing it up, down, left, right, or inward all do different things and if there is any motion in the car, you finger will bump it in one or more wrong direction adjusting things you don't want to.The process to switch between displaying the clock and the song info is so tedious requiring 4-5 careful movements of this joystick (every time) that it is virtually impossible to do while driving.Other than the joystick control, the unit is great. Unfortunately it is a rather central feature."
1,cannot install on a Mac,"I cannot install this software on my Mac and the label says its for PC or Mac. I have the latest Snow Leopard OS and we have tried everything but it will not allow us to install it. The program keeps insisting we need administrator authority but does not allow us to enter the password. We tried setting up another admin account on the computer, still no way. Also there is no phone number for technical support for the manufacturer so complete waste of money for me. Don't buy it if you have a Mac!"
2,"Fun game, but has a glitch","I really like this game, it is very fun. However, there is a glitch in the program and 7 out of 10 times I play this game, the screen goes black and an Microsoft error pops up and shuts down the game. It's very frustrating."
5,My Favorite Cookbook,"This is my very favorite cookbook. I have a first printing from my mother-in-law. A lot of the southern York Co. entries are from her family and mine. A lot of my family recipes have been lost and I found them again in this book. My mom's deliscous Peanut Butter Fudge recipe is in here, as well as our favorite Pecan Pie. Most of the recipes are easy and made with easy to find local ingredients."
5,Effective and comfortable product,I work in a lab with a lot of noise. The muffs block the low frequency noises but allows me to hear people talk. Also the fit is comfortable.
4,Just as described. They are very pretty....no visable flaws.,No visable flaws....so pretty....great luster....pricey but worth it. Purchased for my pregnant daughter for Christmas. Box was sort of cheapy looking but the pearls were nice.
4,"German, wizard!","I found the German pop music is amazing to listen. Such as Scorpion and Sash. I love this CD because I can't help but jump with it whenever I listen to it. To my surprise, I never get tired of it even after I enjoyed it many times. I am just looking forward to her new album."
5,Who likes insurance?,One hundred bucks to protect a twelve hundred dollar investment for four years speaks for itself. Twenty-five bucks per year for peace of mind. I hope I never have to use it.
1,Mc Swatt hater,"This CD was the worst. Who ever told this Kid he could rap, even yet how the did he ever get a cd. This doesn't even deserve a one for a rating. This should be banned from everywhere and this kid needs to be locked up. He sounds like a crazy psycho wanna be rapper.The Lyrics in this cd make absolutley no sense, and I doubt people really care to hear how he can't get a women. You call that singing? He must of wrote that review with the 5 stars cause it sure doesn't deserve that high of a rating! MC Swatt lives no more!"
4,great book!,"This one is such a great gift! It is packed with beautiful, heartwarming and inspirational stories. I was in tears pretty much from cover to cover! Happy tears though that demonstrate God's abundant love for us."
1,Third Party Contract - I am skeptical,"This warranty is not from Amazon or the company you are purchasing from. It is instead a contract with a third party. You better read it before you spend a hundred bucks.The first rule of this agreement is you have to be able to produce the contract. The second the receipt. Next you can't have any other warranties in effect. Then you need to give them three chances to fix your purchase. They choose who to send it to. You might have to pay the shipping. You are not covered for the inconvenience of any of this. This is just the first page! I couldn't read anymore because of the poor quality of the file posted here.Good luck to you and your lawyer and who ever N.E.W is.The world is broken. Warranties as ""extras"". I can get all the broken stuff I want at the dump for free. What are manufactures thinking when they don't stand behind their products?"
3,its what I ordered,"It's exactly what I ordered. I am just a little pissed I couldn't buy the nickel-cadnium battery instead. I could have got two of those for the price of this sucker, and I have nickel-cadnium batteries that have lasted for years, while this type failed just outside of warranty and couldn't be rebuilt."
2,"derivative, egotistical, but not as bad as his CD","the cover photo doesn't make sense unless one has seen Jewel's book. something about the look on the face, though, is annoying--it says it all. the poems say very little except that Sia has deep resentments, no mercy and can't feel a thing. it's a vicious attack cloaked in parody--railing against ""uncool"" pop poetry with ""cool"" pop poetry. the CD is even worse: ""I'm the world's greatest emcee..."" he's not. self-vaunting and screechy sounding, the voice on the CD also says it all...ending with a leech-like suck and spew of how Ginsberg said he was ""beautiful"" at some poetry reading in New York just days before his death. America the Beautiful. Beau Sia wants to be the America. Beau Sia the America! but he needs your support before he can become her. and burn you."
2,Amusing But Why Bother...,"Sia does what anyone with any or without talent could do, trash Jewel's poems. But I argue this book is easy, an easy target. Perhaps if it saves one teenager from taking Jewel's pathetic attempts at writing seriously, it has some worth. But in the end I have to ask, why bother? Especially when Sia has yet to offer the world anything resembling art on his own. In effect then is this book not then a jaded-pop-star-wanna-be parodying who he wishes he could become? I wondered that while reading ..."
2,"Built in 2004, says it all.......","Just got this and wish I had saved my money. You will probably see it in the used section. If you have a 4 year old computer then this is probably the best you can do, but the graphics are almost laughable by todays standards, and the game play is so very basic. Rise of Nations is much superior and I'm looking for something more interesting than that. Unless you just want to see things explode into polygons, don't bother with this."
1,don't disapoint your child with this,"I received this item and had nothing but problems. It had missing parts, loose parts and the battery charger doesn't work. This thing never drove an inch. An absolute piece of junk. Oh yeah, good luck with customer service."
2,Good for basics only,"This book was a good resource for a quick review. It would also be helpful for someone just beginning to study nephrology. However, for someone with a solid foundation in medicine this book is far too elementary. The pictures, although humerous, do not really help remember any useful information. There were a few useful equations and lab values."
5,Great Book!,This book is another winner! I couldn't put it down and ended up reading it in two evenings. Keep 'em coming Marsha!!
2,Not 3 inches deep!,"I bought this pan so I could make a triple layer mousse which requires a 3 inch deep pan. This pan is described as 3 inches deep but is actually 3 inches tall (versus deep). Due to the nature of springform pans and the glass bottom, this is only 2 3/4 inches deep - standard springform pan depth. As a result I cannot make the mousse I bought the pan for.I am very irritated that the description is so misleading. I would have sent this back but I tossed the packaging before I thought to measure the pan.As to all the posts about the nonstick coating peeling, you should hand wash it as I do all my better cookware."
1,Very flimsy!,"I bought two of these and couldn't wait to get them in. When they came, I immediately took them out of the box, washed and used them. They were supposed to be 10"" pans, but they are really about 9 1/2"". That wouldn't really matter except that I make the cheesecakes to sell and I use a 10"" cardboard cake circle, instead of the glass bottom of the pan, and it doesn't fit. Much to my disappointment, the metal latch was so flimsy, that it actually bent instead of holding its tension. Now I am going to have to return both of them and re-order another brand. WOULD NOT BUY THIS AGAIN!"
3,Nothing wrong with the bits themselves as far as I can tell,"The shanks on these bits are so small they will not fit in any drill chuck I have, I never really realized the chucks had a minimum dimension before (my fault). At least they were cheap."
3,Average game,"The ending was the most dissappointing part of the game, no response from the character when it was completed. I finished with the correct response too. The whole game was calming and the music was nice. I just hope Riven and Myst III turn out better."
1,Warning notice required,"Does not work on new computers. Should be a warning given to consumers before purchase accepted, for example an acknowledgement required."
1,waste of money dont buy this,This was a total joke. I was very disapointed this product is trash. Little or no vibration. Its just a waste of money dont buy this you will not be happy i know im notits sooo bad i dont even give it one star
3,Not enough has changed,In 2012 the NFL still seems ready to look the other way. While I'm not a huge football fan this book she'd light on a side of the game that all to sadly pointed out that the names I recognized were for there off field activities not their performance on the field.
3,Good book if you are interested in law and sports,The book has many eye opening stories about guys who play in the NFL. The facts are great because they come right from different police files and such. Not one of those feel good books about the NFL.
3,Nice Screens.,"I like this screen. Since I baught a few of them (same type) I had a chance to compare. My only issue is that one of them closes needing much more effort than the others. I figure they should all close with the same quality of ease on the user. But if one keeps it open, then there is no problem.The picture display quality is good; as I tried several brand of projectors with them."
5,From CSI To Bones,"FBI agent Seeley Booth is in Chicago working on a mob case when his witness is abducted from a safe house. Booth needs to divert his attention from this case, however, when skeletons (assembled from different donors) begin showing up around town. His friend, Dr. Temperance Brennan is called in to help in her role as a forensic anthropologist. Collins stays with the characters from the TV series and enlarges on them for the reader. This is a fast moving, entertaining read. I certainly hope Collins continues this series as he has done for CSI. I am a big fan of both and Collins brings more depth and enjoyment to these established TV shows."
3,Erstaz,"Its unfortunate that Kathy Reichs licensed her product and allowed her name to be used so visibly. While certainly not horrible, it's not as good as the writing in her Tempe Brennan series."
5,Bones,This was a very funny read and touched down on different sides of the characters not seen in the show. This book by Max Allan Collins is an excellent take on the Bones relationship. I loved it.
1,a tired tv retread,"This obviously recycled tv plot, with its flat characterizations and shifting points of view bears no resemblance to Ms. Reichs's earlier works. Save yourself the money and catch this story in reruns."
1,Don't Waste Your Time,"A totally contrived and badly written book. I found it hard to believe that this was written be a professional writer. Based on the television series, which is actually interesting and fun to watch, this book suffers by comparison. No character development whatsoever, stilted dialogue, stock characters. Don't bother with this knock-off of Kathy Reich's wonderful series."
5,"Welcome back, Sierra!","We missed you! With the introduction of Sierra Lavotini, the readers of mysteries starring wonderfully human female sleuths have another series to wait impatiently for. In Strip Poker, Nancy Bartholomew has returned us to Sierra's world- complete with all the lovable characters, and not so lovable ones, we hope to meet again and again. Keep writing, and we'll keep reading!"
4,America's First Family of Music,"Loved the video, although it should've been longer. I would have loved to see more of the Jackson Five footage, the complete performances. This video shows clips of footage. I must admit it took me back some years, but it was well worth it. I allowed my family to view the video and they loved it as well, but wished it would've been longer. This brought back some good time memories. ""I Think About The Good Times."" I would ask that each of you purchase this video as a collectors item to reflect back on the good old times, and most of all to support the Jackson Family. I hope they will come out with a video of the Jackson Five showing full tv shows and concerts they did back in the day. Thank you Marlon for doing such a fantastic job on the narration. Also, I thought the interview Marlon's daughter did with the Jackson Five plus Randy was great.Lynn, okc"
3,"little bit ""Sex and the City""","This book was a good read for work breaks, short chapters. It seemed a little too much like Sex and the City, the character's name was also Karrie. It was an OK read, and it made me glad I hadn't dated guys like that, but I didn't think it was anything fantastic. It did have a very heartwarming line about her stepfather though."
1,Leaky,"This is the leakiest springform pan I have ever used. What a mess, butter from the graham cracker crust seeped out. Plus the pan is flimsy. Don't waste your money, go with the Frieling Glass Bottom pan-it doesn't leak and has a sturdier glass base."
2,Cordless???? What a lie!!!!,"The ""phone"" itself is not bad, but is by no means cordless. It most certainly needs to be attached to my computer by a flimsy USB cable that is permanently attached to the ""phone"". Yes, the base is cordless, but it is just a little piece of plastic to hold the CORDED phone in an upright position when you are not using it. I guess that I should have known better than to expect a cordless phone for this price. It's too bad that they lied in the description of the product!!!! Please update the description so that others won't be deceived into buying a product that might not be what they were expecting. I expect better from you, Amazon!!!"
4,Good phone,"The quality of the phone is outstanding. The clarity of the conversation is amazing. I took one point off because sometimes, my interlocutor hears me echoing."
2,Problems in Vista. Unusable on Mac OS X 10.5.x,"Doesn't work properly with new versions of Skype in Windows Vista. It required me to use the Skype ver.3 that comes on the CD-Rom. When I upgraded to version 4.1 the sound turned garbled and the buttons stopped function properly. The ring tones are so shrill that my ears nearly bled. The handset has no volume control, you must open the Phillips Voip0801 driver to adjust volume.Other than that...If Phillips would provide better driver support it could be a 4*. I give it a 2* only because I got mine for $20 with shipping. If I had paid full price I would have rated 0 and returned it."
5,Works with Linux 2.6 Kernel,"A nice little usb phone for those if us who get tired of wearing the headset every once in a while.Though made of light weight plastic, the phone is still solid for the task at hand. If you're on Windows it allows for perfect integration with Skype via the handset controls.Usb cord wraps around the phone for easy storage--this along with a handy carrying case for travel makes it a neat little package at an affordable price.For those using Linux, the handset allows for sound in and out only. No functionality exists for the handset controls. But this is no problem as the ringer can be routed through the computer's sound system and dialing may be done via keyboard or by mouse via on-screen touch keys.Lastly, a phone cradle allows for the permanent attachment of the phone to the computer. No fussing with the sound controls every time Skype is started. Phone also has a look that complements any decor.Highly recommended."
3,question re recent purchase of this phone,"anyone know if as of now there are still compatibility issues w this phone and skype, as mentioned in th 2 most recent reviews?skype sells a version of this phone, model VOIP1511B-10, also by philips, for $ 60im sure skype makes sure this phone has no compatibility issues, but since theyre both by philipsone would assume philips makes both phones to be compatible w th latest version of skypehas anyone purchased this phone in th last month and had these issues w/ skype?ths for any help in advance"
1,bad choice,Brass is extremely toxic to birds. I would never buy this product unless I was just that sick that I would want to harm my bird.
4,the game,The dvd played excellent everything I wanted except the songs on the dvd were different from the ones on tv.. n plus all the cases were broken once I opened them....
1,BEWARE:Storkcraft changed product & quality,"We first purchased this dresser in Fall 2008 and were really pleased with the quality and look for the price. Even though a piece came broken, Storkcraft immediately sent us a replacement one. However, when we order this same dresser combo for our second child just now I was surprised to see all the inside shelves, baseboards and sideboards are an ugly, cheap particle board white. When we called Storkcraft customer service they acknowledged the change, but didn't have a good reason. This taught us a valuable lesson - beware of buying furniture online when there's no photos of the inside. Unless you just can't find anything better for the price, skip this one."
3,It will serve its purpose...,"I was very hesitant after seeing such mixed reviews. This is a nice looking piece, but is not the greatest piece ever built. I don't know how long this will last us as a piece of furniture to grow with baby, but for the price, it will serve its purpose.The instructions were easy to follow, but because of the MANY MANY pieces, this item took longer to put together than our Storkcraft Rochester crib. I believe it took us almost 3 hours, largely because we couldn't get the door on straight.In short, I think the Storkcraft furniture is all about your expectations. If you expect high quality furniture for a low price, you will be disappointed as many of the reviewers here seem to be. If you expect decent furniture for a decent price, you will probably have your expectations met."
1,Not Impressed,"This is a nice looking dresser, however I would not recommend it. Some of the hardware was missing, screw holes in the wood were either misplaced, too small, or not there at all. It took a while to put together as wooden pieces did not appear as displayed on directions."
1,"Very Poor Quality, and a Waste of Money","We purchased this, assembled it, and within months hardware started popping off. Within a year, the drawers started falling apart. We ordered it hoping to shift it from a changing table to a dresser when our son got older, but it has not even lasted for a changing table. We are looking for a replacement and this one will be going in the trash, as it is not even repairable. We are so frustrated and disappointed, as we thought we were buying something of decent quality, and it has just been a hassle."
2,"Not what I expected, Overpriced for what it is","The description says ""solid wood/wood products"" - but it's mainly ""wood products"" AKA particle board. It smells and needed time to off-gas, not exactly what I was hoping for in a baby's room. There were several dings in the wood finish when we received it and several more created in assembly, despite using utmost care to try and put it together without damage. We were missing two parts for assembly as well, two drawer bottoms. My husband just want to Home Depot to buy something suitable since we didn't trust contacting this company for support since the claim about the product wasn't entirely accurate. This won't be a long-lasting piece, that much is certain. It seems like it should have been worth about $100 off the shelf at a local big box store. We were disappointed."
4,Quick shipment with a few dings - Still very nice,"AFTER ALL THE HORROR STORIES WE READ ON HERE, WE WERE WORRIED BUT PURCHASED WITH PLENTY OF TIME FOR RETURNS. WE RECIEVED THE ITEM WITHIN 2 WEEKS OF PLACING OUR ORDER AND IT WAS GREAT. ALL OF THE PARTS WERE THERE AND IT WAS VERY EASY TO PUT TOGETHER. IT TOOK MY HUSBAND AND I LESS THAN 1 HOUR TO PUT IT COMPLETELY TOGETHER. IT HAD A FEW SMALL DINGS BUT A BLACK MAGIC MARKER COVERED THEM RIGHT UP. IT IS A BEAUTIFUL PIECE AND I'D RECOMMEND THIS PURCHASE TO EVERYONE. WE LOVE IT AND WE KNOW OUR BABY WILL AS WELL!"
2,"cheap ""wood"", chipped finish...not worth the money","While the dresser looks nice once it is put together, I was not impressed with the quality of craftsmanship. The dresser is particle board with a very thin wood topping; it cracks and falls apart when things are screwed together. The finish had splotches that were not painted and some areas were noticeably darker than others. I'm a little worried the dressed won't hold up for long and it definitely wont hold up if it ever needs to be moved from this house. Overall, my husband and I thought it was a cheaply made furniture with an over inflated price. I guess that's what we get for trying to buy a dresser that was a little less money than others."
2,Not worth it!,"I ordered this online and got the pieces in the mail. 3 pieces were damaged so we called the manufacturer for replacements. They said it would take 2 to 3 weeks. Its been 3 weeks, when I called again they said it would take another 2 weeks. How hard is it to get replacements?? My baby is due anytime now and the changing table is still in pieces. Would like to get the nursery done, preferrably before my child goes to college. We purposely ordered it early to give us time, but apparently that wasnt enough. I tell you its very frustrating and so not worth it."
4,Balanced and Informative,"This DVD proved to be well balanced and informative. The commentary was by some of the better scholars in the field, in addition to the usual cast of characters that seem to appear in all of the Da Vinci documentaries. The extras were well worth the 40 minutes to watch, and should be viewed in addition to the regular show. I would have liked to see more on the development of the canon and early church history discussed, but in general the documentary actually proved to be one - not a fantastic tale or wild speculation. Worth watching."
3,Its a decent value for its price,This model while fairly inexpensive has a lot of flaws. The interior requires a lot of work. The instrument decal is poorly designed it has to go over an extremely uneven instrument panel. Also the back of the chairs are not detailed and have injector pin marks which are clearly visible on the finished model unless they are filled. The tail booms do not fit flush to the wings. Overall if you want extreme detail this model will require a lot of aftermarket parts.
4,A Good american cook book. Recipes made for the way you eat.,"Recipes directions subdivided for all cooks; child to master chef. Food that you actually eat not leaving you to wonder, ""what IS this"" when reading the food descriptions. Their is a set aside cooking section for ""cooking with children"" and very easy directions with words to what you will expect at each level as you make each dish. For those that don't want to have to call on ""Aunt Martha"" at odd times of the night to ask her how to do something and for those who want your mother to be proud and a little envious of your cooking. A good american cook book. Recipes made for the way you eat."
4,Cool application of disparate technology.,"Pretty cool... I am a fan of LED technology, and of course, who doesn't love ""Flying Discs"" - even if they aren't ""Frisbee""? This disk is ""even better"", as it is made by the same guy who makes the Aerobee flying disc. And the Aeropress coffee maker, which I dearly love, but that's another review.We got a couple of these for my sons and friends. It's light, stable, well designed -- kind of an improvement on the classic design. The better part is an addition of LEDs and fiber optics. Truly, I haven't PLAYED with these at night, as my nights of running around playing night frisbee are a bit remote, but the boys say that the units work well.There was one issue with the mechanical design, but I think that it was a switch defect in that one unit. I contacted the vendor (Athlete 101) and they fixed the issue by sending a new unit -- without waiting until the old one had been returned. I highly recommend Athlete 101 for their service!"
4,Works Great,"I have been using diamond blades on my circular saw for years to do Hardi Board and had always resisted buying a blade for my 12"" Miter Saw due to the expense. I finally broke down and bought one when I knew the job was going to require several thousand cuts and many hundreds would be short pieces that are hard to gang cut with a circular saw. The verdict is in and this blade does the job, it will cut 5-6 pieces at once and there is no creep and the cuts are super clean on the face.I still believe that the blades are way too expensive, but what are you going to do."
1,disappointing,"you don't know jack, and you still won't after you read this self-righteous wallow. you see, his sister the author doesn't know him either. he was rarely present in his family, and that's the whole point of the book. sorry to say it, but your time and money are best spent on other books."
5,A Must Have For Every Author,"Frishman & Spizman continue their series on educating writers about how to succeed in the mysterious world of publishing. Whether you write non-fiction or fiction, this book is a ""must have."" In their book, Frishman & Spizman explain how to create the perfect message for your book and how to use the media to get your message to potential readers.

5,Perfect for ALL writers,"As an author, I'm always on the lookout for books that can help with publicity, marketing, and promoting. This book was a pure gem.This book is worth the purchase price just for Chapter 11 (E-mail Blasts) alone. With tips for propelling your book to the top of the bestseller lists by e-mail marketing, this chapter takes you by the hand and leads you through the process step by step in a quick and painless way.This book doesn't just tell you how to promote and publicize your book; it shows you with sample letters and action steps.If you're ready to pump up your promotion and get your book noticed, then this book should be on your list of must-haves!"
3,Cressida in Asia not included.,"As general, this is a good book to learn the basic design of Toyota-Cressida. It covers the Van and Sedan.If this book is intended to sell worldwide, You should consider the Engine type and model. I have 1987 Cressida with engine type of 1G-E and 1998 cc, and it does not cover. I find hard to find the similarities.I believe this book only applicable to US and Canada only. So, buyer/reader out side those country should contact the publisher or the author first.The best part of details are in the Drive Train, Suspension,Brakes and Emission control. Most helpful picture displayed for Van, Only drawing mostly provided for Sedan.I think the Author should deeper in the sections of 'Engine and Engine Overhaul', Chasis electrical and cabin electrical, especially for indicators for instrument.Thank you."
1,The Norwegian Wood experience,"Curious from reading interviews, commentary and reviews about Murakami, I decided to read one of his works to learn what I had been missing. After meandering through his sophomoric verbiage and scenery I now know."
3,"Good, but not great.","I really loved parts of this. Some of the scenes are beautiful, and the story is sad and believable. This isn't a love story, though. It's about coming of age and mental illness, so don't read it expecting romance.The protagonist is flat; it's the people around him that make the story interesting. And those people kept coming to their demise, one by one, and then the story ends.Like I said, some parts were really beautiful, but the story got tiring. About a third of the way through I put the book down and didn't pick it up again for a few weeks. I'm glad I finished it - it was a worthwhile read - but I didn't feel compelled to stay up late reading or to read this instead of something else."
5,Just wonderful,I have never read a novel written Japanese. I could not stop reading this novel once I started. It kade me think about death and live well. It gives me the image of them.
3,Instrumentals only please.. no more singing,I tend to agree with many others.. TSO can certainly rock the house with the instrumentals... and the female singing is good in some songs... but couldn't listen to any of the songs that were sung by a male. They just sounded creepy or like I was watching a kids story but a creepy one. Nothing wrong with his voice and he can certainly sing.. but it just doesn't work. TSO should stick with the instrumentals and at $2.99 for the entire album this is a great deal for the 8 or 9 tolerable songs.
2,Dissapointment...,"I usually love this sort of music (big orchestral arrangements with guitars and drums, big Celtic productions, etc.). This felt as though it was rushed through production or something - most of it sounded like something a Music Major put together for a class project. The lead guitar was the only redeeming feature - it was really above and beyond the quality of the rest of the CD (the lead guitar is why I'm giving two stars instead of just one).The entire CD is very repetitive - many times, all of the instruments are playing exactly the same thing over and over and over. The male vocal sounded forced.I will give Trans-Siberian Orchestra another chance by purchasing a different CD sometime in the future, but this was a real disappointment..."
4,Great Album,Sort of a classic now it's a great Christmas album with a unique mix of orchestra and rock instruments as the Trans-Siberian orchestra usually does.
3,its okay,Found this album to be less interest than others of the this bandSome will find it more to there liking than I did
2,Hmmm -- Somewhat Overblown...,"OK -- After reading some other reviews, I'm feeling like the bad guy. My first impression of this CD? ""A Spinal Tap Christmas"" However, that assessment may be a bit too harsh. Spinal Tap was at least entertaining.This reminds me of what would happen if Marillion married Krokus and had kids. They'd celebrate the holiday season exactly as TSO. Great production values / pretentious and overblown. Kind of like watching an off, off broadway production of Phantom. Good try, but lacking in creativity and originality.I'm going to stick with Mannheim Steamroller...(And, by the way, Marillion is a great band)"
5,ALL HAIL THE KINGS OF CHRISTMAS!!!,"PAUL O'NEAL, ROBERT KINKEL, JON OLIVA AND ALL THE PERFORMERS SHOULD BE PLACED UPON A GOLDEN CHARIOTS, DRAPED WITH JEWELS AND PARADED THROUGH THE STREETS OF AMERICA! IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR RE-HASHED, BORING, RE-RECORDINGS OF SIMPLE CHRISTMAS CLASSICS, KEEP LOOKING! IF YOU WANT FANTASY STORY-LINES, CLASSIC ARRANGMENTS, SOARING VOCALS, ASTOUNDING GUITARS, BOMBASTIC STRINGS, MELODIC PIANO AND LOADS OF EMOTION, GET THIS CD!!! FOR THAT MATTER, PICK UP THE FIRT TWO T-S-O CD'S AS WELL!NEVER BEFORE HAS A BAND BROUGHT OUT SO MUCH EMOTION IN ME! THE WHOLE WORLD SHOULD EXPERIENCE THIS! IF YOU CAN, CATCH A LIVE PERFORMANCE NEAR YOU! THESE GUYS MAKE MANHEIM-STEAMROLLER LOOK LIKE ROOKIES! ROCK ON T-S-O! AND HAVE A HAPPY HOLIDAY!!!"
1,Not what we expected!,"Went to the concert. We expected an orchestrated Christmas program like last time. It was AWFUL! Our group of 10 left after 20 minutes of blaring, incoherent noise! The men kept flipping their hair (like it was supposed to really add something to the music)! Totally gross waste of time and money!"
2,Disappointing... TSO at their worst,"Compared to TSO's other offerings, this almost stands out as an example of how to do everything wrong. With the singular exception of ""Wizards in Winter"" (Track 3), which is worth a solid four stars, everything about this album is sub-par. The narrative is unclear and uninspiring, the reimagined traditional pieces are few and far between (and disappointing compared to similar offerings on TSO's other albums), and, worst, the classical-modern fusion that defines TSO is lacking to the point of being nearly absent.If you don't already haveChristmas Eve and Other Stories, get that instead; it is significantly better in every way. If you have it already, consider giving this a pass."
3,not as good as i thought it would be,i bought it since i heard that one song being playing at Christmas time wizards in winter. first time i ever bought one of there cds. i was hoping all the songs where they type of beat. but there where not most where now where near like that song but i guess i`m not atrans-siberian orchestra guyunless you are one that likes there music and you like that one song. buy the song it self
1,heavy metal christmas music,you got to be kidding me! people like this stuff? it is heavy metal christmas music. come on.
3,Can we have music only?,"I thought this would be great; I love the TSO music. However, the singing voice ruins it. Can we get just the music without the singer? They are geniuses at making music!!"
5,The Lost Christmas Eve by Trans-Siberian Orchestra,Terrific!! Love everything the TSO has done and this was just as awesome! I highly recommend this CD and all their CDs.
1,Just the facts please,"This author is quite unfortunately uninformed about at least one religion he has labeled in this book. It seems to me a person should thoroughly research something to establish credibility before taking the position of ""expert"" on the subject, and writing a book.If you want a Fiction, check this book out of a library (hopefully they don't have it though). If you want the truth, Google it for yourself, and find the official web site for that particular religion. Oh, and look up the dictionary definition of ""cult"" first.I'm sort of surprised someone hasn't sued for slander, yet, in this sue-happy world.Don't buy it. It's musguided and inaccurate."
2,Not so great if you need to change weights quickly,"I bought these weights to use with P90X and while they are ok for the price, I can't recommend them for use in P90X because you have to change the weight too often and quickly. I found the plates and the pins to be cumbersome and easily misaligned. You can insert the pin and not actually be in the correct spot and then the plates shift while you are doing reps. Its not so easy to add or subtract weights. If you are just going to stick with the same weight for most of your routine, then these would work fine, but in P90X I am sometimes using three different weights for one three exercise circuit.I got my husband the bowflex dial weights and those are MUCH better in terms of ease of switching weights although they are twice the price. I am going to go back to the traditional dumbbell weights for ease of switching."
2,Flimsy,I tried to use these to drill into oak and maybe it's because they're thin but I've broken nearly all of them. I think they are of inferior steel.
2,Looks nice but noise,"Installation was easy and trouble free. Then I tested it and it worked fine, it was not noisy. However, I tried it again, a few minutes later and it started making a bad humming noise. I took it all apart, I made sure that none of the screws/nails were loose. It still made the noise. I took it all apart again, I found out the motor mounting plate rattles within the fan housing.The problem I have is that there is no way to fix it other than removing the entire housing. I am not pleased."
4,NBC JACK & SALLY PEWTER CANDLEHOLDERS,"HEAVY SOLID PEWTER CANDLE HOLDERS-BUT ARE VERY EASY TO FALL OVER.THEY ARE NOT VERY WELL BALANCE-WHEN I USE THEM,I PUT STICKY TYPE PUTTY ON THE BASE,TO HOLD IT UP.THEY ARE NICE LOOKING BUT JUST NOT BALANCE RIGHT."
2,good for novices bad for professionals,"Very wide range of topics, but very little depth. I don't think this is really a book for the advanced programmer. There is only one measly chapter on ActionScripting, which is one of the most useful features of Flash 4. I didn't find it useful at all when it came to backend/Flash integration - you'd be better off trying something else."
3,Not for those who want to create flash with FLASH,"This book is a good 30,000 foot overview of Flash, but I was quite disappointed that there was alot of bones, but no meat to sink my teeth into.If you are looking for something that will give you a good overview of Flash and what it can do, this may be ok, but if you want something that will teach you the innerworkings and help you create ""flashy"" Flash sites... go elsewhere"
1,Very Basic - A Big Disappointment,"This book falls far short of my expectations. My experience with the IDG Bible series is that they are thorogh, and complete - this voulme is neither. If you are new to Flash, this may be an option - but I would advise you to save your money and read the manual, and other online resources. Those of us who want to continue developing the advanced features of Flash are wasting our time with this book. It is by far the worst in the Bible series I've read. All in all - a very big disappointment."
3,No Payoff.,"It's like reading the manual really, really slowly. After weeding through the basic stuff, which can't be helped nowadays, you only find more generalized, basic information. I expected a lot more coming from a lot of the leaders in the flash industry. Granted there were some great chapters, generally by contributing authors, but even these were available sooner online. I think perhaps, this book chose to be too broad in covering every aspect of flash, which led to having to skim over certain areas that users at my level find most crucial. For a beginner who is put off by the manual for whatever reason, this is a great book. For someone who has already taken on flash, this book will become tiresome. Had this book arrived at the release of Flash 4, then it certainly would've faired better, at least with me. 3 stars because it's valuable to some and not to others. Hope the Flash 5 bible can surpass the already provided documentation for Flash 5."
2,There are better Flash bibles...,"Frankly, as someone who does nothing but Flash work and is now teaching it, I would not recommend this book. It's basically a more expensive and slightly better organized version of the manual that comes with Flash. In a few cases where I tried to apply the information given (using forms), the info was actually faulty or incomplete and led to frustration rather than enlightenment. And this is from someone who knows action script very very well! Essentially, there are two books that stand out for me. For folks who want to learn Flash design and animation basics - Hillman Curtis' Flash Web Design is the best. For those who wish to learn action script, nothing can beat Flash 4 Magic. Both have real world examples and source files to back them up."
4,"Really ""The Bible"", Really!","The Flash 4 Bible bills it's self as ""100% comprehensive, authoritative, what you need"". Well, 100% is a lofty goal, the book is more like 99% comprehensive!Every Flash developer from beginner to advanced will find this book a must have. Have you ever used the manual included with the Flash software and found yourself scratching you're head? Well not with this book, the writing and lessons are clear and concise.As a professional Flash developer this book is permanently on my bookshelf and is my first ""go to"" reference.Thank you, Robert Reinhart and Jon Warren Lentz for writing The Flash 4 Bible."
5,Great Desk and Great Value,"I purchased this desk after reading a number of reviews for my daughter as a Christmas present. It was easy to put together and has been used daily since she got it. It is not a large desk, but perfect for a toddler and if you are short on space. We have it in the living room. My daughter loves the seat that lifts up and the light that she turns on and off. Lots of places to put crylons, markers, stamps, etc. Very easy to keep clean. I shopped around and you will not find a better desk at this price anywhere."
4,Loved This Desk,"I bought this for my grandson Kai to use at my home. He is 2 andloves his new desk. He uses it for coloring and for his IPad, oh and sometimeshe insists on eating at the desk!!!I put the desk together myself which means its pretty easy!"
4,Too small for a 4 year old!,"As someone mentioned before in their review, this desk is definitely NOT for a 7 yr. old like the manufacturer says. We bought this for my son when he was two. He is now four, and we are shopping for a new one, because he is just too big for it anymore. It is very nice, and we got a lot of use out of it, but it's already time to upgrade."
1,Stainless steel stucky pan,This pan was advertised as nonstick. I felt that I followed all instructions pretaining to the pre use of this pan.>Everyhing stuck that I put in the pan. I could have bought a cheap aluminum pan that would have worked better.
1,Do not buy this toy,"My daughter was so excited about this camera, but I am returning it as soon as I can.First, the battery compartment was a nightmare -- there needs to be 4 AA and 1 camera battery. The camera battery compartment wouldn't unscrew -- took 3 adults half an hour to get it out.Second, the quality as noted by other reviewers wasn't great. However, my daughter was happy to take the photos, and I was thinking it was okay. not a great toy, but okay.Then we downloaded the photos. We got about half down loaded and the computer froze. tried to download a few more times, but now the camera is frozen and not working at all.It is a great idea, too bad it didn't work... My daughter of course is crushed."
3,"Durable & fun, pictures not too good","Bought this camera as a birthday present for our 5 year old daughter. She and her 2 year old little brother have had a lot of fun with it. It is very durable-- it has been dropped off of the kitchen counter more than once and has continued to work fine. The picture quality is not that good -- kind of blurry and the flash doesn't always illuminate the whole frame. Overall, a fun toy that keeps the kids from wanting to ""play"" with our more expensive digital camera, but don't expect to take album-quality pictures with it."
5,Fisher Price Kid-Tough Digital Camera for Girls,I bought 2 of these cameras for my 2 grandaughters and saw first-hand how thrilled one was as she took the pictures and how good it made her feel to see that she had done a good job. This camera is priceless when it comes to giving children a way to know what they are doing is a GREAT JOB and that they can download the pictures and put them into their own scrapbook for their memories and to show others what means a lot to them.This cameras is priceless!
3,"great toy, poor camera","My daughter got this for her birthday, and she loves it. She takes ""pictures"" every where she goes. The ""camera"" is rough and tough and just right for little hands.The ""photos,"" unfortunately, are extrememly low quality, making this little more than an overpriced (but very entertaining) toy. Yes, if everything is just the right distance in just the right light, and if you hold the camera very, very still, you may get a barely passable snapshot -- but this is not how a five-year-old takes pictures. Great idea, Fisher Price, but not quite great enough to make up for the dismal photo quality. (I will try to post a typical five-year-old snapped photo.)"
1,Very Disappointing,"I bought this camera for my 3.5yo daughter for Christmas. What a disappointment it was. The quality of the LCD display and the pictures are so poor, you can barely make out what the picture is. I was so excited when I saw this product come on the market, as my daughter likes to take pictues with my digital camera. I had thought about buying her an inexpesive digital one until this one came out. But now I'm regretting this purchase. I'm returning it today. It is too frustrating for her to use when she can't see any of the pictures she is actually taking, just sees a whole lot of fuzz."
3,Wasn't impressed.,"I was not happy with product at all. I understand it is made for a child, but you should still be able to take decent photos. My three year old takes perfect pictures with an adult digital camera, but this one shows you a full view in the window, yet cuts off half the photo when taken."
1,Flimsy Handles,"Actually, judging by how many other reviews did not mention any mishap with the handles, I am tempted to think I was just unlucky and got a defective product. One of the handles popped out the first time I used it, and the screw holding it in was cross-threaded and couldn't be either unscrewed or tightened. Because one of the handles is now dangling, every time I close the crimper, the handle is pushing onto the thin metal sheet side and creates a dent which becomes larger with each use. Not to mention that pressing the crimper closed is now possible only by pressing my hand against the cutting back edge. I wish the manufacturer read these reviews and responded to this one with an offer for product replacement."
3,Angelique ages,"Hoping to free himself and the entire Collins family from the evil schemes of the witch Angelique, Barnabas Collins hires artist Sam Evans to age her portrait, causing Angelique to turn into a 200-year-old woman.Adam kidnaps Carolyn Stoddard and hides her in an abandoned farm cellar. Willie Loomis becomes the next victim of Angelique's evil dream curse, intended to revert Barnabas back into a vampire."
4,"Made for bigger ears, but sounds great","This headset is easy to use and sounds great, but if you have small ears, it falls off when you bend over."
3,arrgh!!,I also had this bluetooth.I was in love with my headset.The gel for the earpiece bothered me so i took it off and that is how it broke.....!! If you get it be VERY CAREFUl!!
3,Jabra BT5020 versus the Jabra BT2020,I have both the BT5020 and the BT2020. The only thing that the BT5020 has over the BT2020 is that it allows you to connect to two different phones at the same time. Very helpful when I'm carrying my personal and work cell. Whichever phone rings it jumps directly to the blue tooth without even touching either phone.The voice quality on the BT5020 is not so good. I drive around in a big box truck and people have a hard time hearing me when I didn't get that at all with the BT2020. I have to cup my ear to mouth in order to be heard.
2,"Love this Headset, but It's Easily Breakable","Length:: 1:38 MinsI'm a fan of the Jabra 5020 headset -- it fits very well and comfortably around my ear and I've enjoyed good reception when connected to both my Treo 680 and iPhone. But I've gone through two models, and both have broken. The earpiece seems to be the weak link in this headset, as it's broken twice in my pocket (from not very rough treatment)."
1,Don't bother with this one,"I don't know how anyone could write a positive review about this ear piece. The sound quality is horrible, my friends tell me it sounds like I am in a tunnel (when they can hear me at all), it drops the connection to my phone while I am talking, and the talk time is only about 30 per charge."
4,Pretty Good,"Here is my opinion, long story short.BonusComfortable, although sometimes I need to switch ears, it does tend to ache a bit eventually.BogusPicks up EVERYTHING. So if you aren't in a quiet environment, or don't have some way to change the amount it picks up noise, than people will complain why there is a party going on behind you.Seems to have a short battery life. But maybe that is just me.PS3I got this for my PS3, it works quite well for it. You can adjust what noise level it accepts, so that the people you are playing with/against won't hear your tv."
2,Confortable but not functional.,"I bought this as a replacement to my Jabra BT250v, which had just worn out. My decision was also based upon the reviews in Consumer Reports Magazine for blue tooth headsets.I was disappointed when I opened the box and did not find a belt clip-charger like the one provided with my BT 250v. Jabra provides minimal documentation, but I figured it would be simple enough to pair this unit with my Treo 700W. While it was easy enough to pair with my Treo 700W, I have problems with the unit remaining connected to my Treo 700W. There have been many times I find myself holding my Treo 700W on speaker phone because the Jabra BT5020 will not pair.The unit is very comfortable and I was surprised at the new design which had replaced the ear jels on my BT250vIf I had to do over again, I would opt for a model with better pairing and a belt clip."
2,Jabra not Jelling,This headset is an average headset with no outstanding features. I have used other headsets and have gotten much better results. When I am connected on a call the person on the other end has a difficult time hearing me and have said I sound like I am in a tunnel. I have an extremely difficult time when I attempt to connect to the voice command function that I have set up on my phone. I would not recommend this product.
1,Terrible fit,"I had a jabra BT 500 and loved it, I could wear it all day and the eargells fit well inside my ear providing great sound. Unfortunately, I inadvertently left it in the charger for a week and fried it. I decided to replace it with the BT5020 which Jabra advertises as the follow-on model for the now discontinued 500. The BT5020 does not fit nearly as well around the ear and the new style eargells are flimsey and do not fit inside my ear.I returned the BT5020 after playing with it for a few minutes and ordered a Jabra BT 530, which I started using today; so far so good. It fits much more comfortably than the 5020 and I am told that it sounds clear to people I am talking to"
3,Decent headset,"This bluetooth headset is pretty good. It is comfotable to wear all day after a couple of days of getting used to it. My wife sometimes says that there sounds like there is background noise like a wind even when it is dead quiet around me but she can hear my voice clear, but she is easily irritated by those little things. Listening on my end it sounds almost perfect. I bought a Platronixs voyager 510 after I bought this one to see if it is any better but I think I prefer the Jabra. The Jabra looks better, I can hear a little better with it, and it is much more comfortable. My wife said she thought the sound on the voyager was slightly better especially outside but there still was some background noise in it as well. The Voyager really bothered my ear after a while also. With both of them though I can set my phone down in the kitchen and walk through most of my house and it still works fine."
5,Great look.,"This ice bucket is simple and elegant. It is a good size for a larger party. There is no strainer to keep the ice from the water melt, if that is important to you."
4,It's really fun!,"The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is that whatever is inside sometimes seems off-center. Other than that, I love it. I can toss it around by myself or play catch with my husband. I get a really good workout & have fun doing it. It's more fun than I thought it would be, especially if I sit on the big pilates ball while tossing it around. One thing it helps with is anger and stress. If I am upset about something, I can toss the ball around which relieves stress, lets go energy & helps me feel a lot better in just a few minutes. This is a really great product."
3,half a good idea,the 1st thing i had to do was rip out the plastic rack.the rack must be designed for very tiny earbuds - but not for most of them.the container is the size of a 'ring box' so it's a little bulky for your pants pocket. but the keyfob idea is clever.
4,videonow jr,"My daughter was 2 years old when she got her videonow jr and loved it. She soon was able to play the discs by herself. But she loved it too much and was soon out of batteries. So I thought I could buy the car adaptor for it just like for the videonow that my older daughter has, but no. And that is what I'm most frustrated about.I bought a second adapter and have no use for it. So if you buy the videonow jr be prepared to buy alot of batteries."
1,Not a book.,This is a sad disappointment. All it is is a short book of photographs of breads from different places in the world. It's not a bread-recipe book.
1,Cigarette in this book,"This book has a photo of a man smoking a cigarette. I am returning it. If you don't want to show your young child pictures of smoking, don't buy Loving either by the same author. It also has a photo of a man smoking a cigarette."
4,Not exactly Janet Evanovich ...,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I don't think its as funny as Janet Evanovich or Harlan Coben but I did find it entertaining. The story line was a bit ""thin"" but it had the prerequisite mystery/romance/funny lines. A good first book. I look forward to reading more about Hitch Sewell."
5,Works fine as a polishing cloth..,"This was one of those ""might as well get one of these too, while I'm at it"" purchases when I was ordering guitar polish. It's a good cloth for polishing, no more to say about it."
3,Making waves,"Sorry, but I'm not as smitten with this cloth as some of the other reviewers. It's okay; good size, works pretty well, but sheds when new. And despite claims of being laundry-safe, the edges began to unravel after the first wash. I used with Planet Waves Restore polish and got good results, but probably would not buy again."
2,Not what I expected,Not very substantial. It began to tear on my guitar strings. I was hoping for something that would hold up to more uses.
5,Fascinating and Exhaustive,"I thought my 10 year career as Blade Runner appreciator would have overturned all the 'stones' of interest - and yet this book yields countless articles many of which containing subtleties and revelations totally new to me. Of course, if you're not a major blade runner fan you'll want to become one first."
4,Brave Writing -- Bold Plotting -- Weak Ending,Many of Cunningham's sentences make a reader gasp with their elegance. This is a courageously written and conceptualized book. But I found the final section predictable and less fully realized than I would have liked.
2,ponderous book,"I was very eager to read this book, but the excitement fizzled as I trudged my way through the first part of this novel. While the writing is exceptional, ""In The Machine"" was very ponderous. Admittedly, I didn't finish the book and don't plan to in the very near future, but I've wondered if anyone else was as disappointed so early on. For anyone new to the author, read The Hours for a fantastic story."
2,Disappointing,"I described this novel to a friend as a mediocre novel that finally took a turn for the worse. I kept hoping it would get better. Each part, however, went further and further south. Part 3, was ultimately, it's demise. It felt like an episode of the Twilight Zone. Not the original, engaging Twilight Zone, but the new and contrived Twilight Zone.With all of the great literature out there, this was a waste of my time."
2,Disappointed,"Disappointed. As an English teacher, I expected a more compelling and less hokey use of Whitman. The first story, of the deformed Whitman loving boy, was utterly unbelievable and the continuity was incredibly challenging."
5,Just enjoy it!,"The worst thing you can say about this novel is that people are making far too many comparisons to his other novels, which are all excellent. Why do we have to keep comparing it to ""The Hours"" since this book stands on its own with its own merits? If it had been published first, everyone would be raving about it brilliance. Just enjoy it. It's far superior to most other novels on the market today. My favorite book this summer by far!"
4,Engaging,"I admire the author for taking risks with this story. The first two stories are compelling and disturbing, but gripping. The last...well, I don't think the author has a future as a science-fiction writer, but he made an admirable stab at it."
3,Ultimately disappointing,"The three stars are for the first two novellas of this three-part novel. The first story is set in Industrial-Age New York and it is, by far, the best of the three, with its eerie settings and interesting insights into 19th-century urban life. The second story takes place in post-9/11 New York and moves along at the crackling pace of a crime novel. So far, so good. In the third section -- a sci-fi ""thriller"" set in the distant future -- the wheels fly off entirely and it becomes painfully clear that Cunningham is just not comfortable writing in this genre. For me, this ludicrous bit of nonsense, which could have been based on an episode of ""Lost in Space,"" almost ruined the power of everything that came before. If you can bring yourself to do it, read the first two sections and then close the book once and for all."
5,Great Game!,"I bought this game about a year ago off amazon.com. I imediatly fell in love with it. It is a good game, though the jousting is a little tricky at first. It is easy to beat, but still really fun. It's one of those games that you can play over and over again, because there are multiple charecters for you to choose from. It has good graphics and okay music. The jousts add an excellent componet to the game; they give you the opportunity to win land and troops. This is a game where the mini-games are important; without fencing and jousting, you'll have a very hard time. This is a great first GBA game to buy; it will introduce the controls and provide hours of fun! No one should miss this game!"
1,This book is at errible and a waste of money,All this book contains is a collection of newspaper and magazine articles about software failures. The in-depth analysis promised by the back cover blurbs consists of a very short summary section at the book's end and grouping the articles into sections based on why they failed.
1,Danger Will Robinson!!,"Stay away from this product. There is no reason for anybody to purchase this item. It gets a star because it worked for a few cycles. It does not move air and it's threshold claim of 140 degrees is a gross over estimation. Go with the Inline Fan TT100 4"" 115CFM 2 Speed Sold by: FanAm, Inc. here on Amazon. It moves air, is easily dismantled in sections, is cleanable, instantly flow reversible, and will operate near 140 without failure."
4,Fresh gazer tunes and one stunning song,"If you've ever let yourself get awash in Pearl by Chaperhouse, check out track #3 A/O from Charparticles. Dont try and get the impact from a short audio byte on Amazon, you gotta take in the whole song, the build is awesome. The vocals are georgeous and the song will move you. Overall the CD is good, track 1 is solid and 4 is good too, but worth it all just for track #3. Enjoy! Wagz"
2,Does not cover Windows version of Orcad,"This book may be good for users of older versions of Orcad Capture, but it does not cover the current Ver 7.2 for Windows."
4,This is an umbelievable weigh loss boost,I am completely stoked with Lipoxinol. I lost the last 10 pounds that I was plateau'd on.
4,I see and feel a difference,I like the energy I am getting since taking this. It gives me a clear connection when I exercise and I am aware of the mind/ body connection during my extreme workouts. I have gotten a bit jittery but that only happened when I took it on an empty stomach along with alergy medication and wasn't able to eat for a couple of hours because I didn't have time to eat...that usually never happens. Other than that incident I really like Lipoxinol I'm losing weight for summer!
5,Wonderful & WOW!!!,"I work out 6 times week and try to eat healthy, I have been doing this for over two months now. I tried Lipoxinol for only a week now and have lost 7 pounds and am now a size 4!! this product controlls my hunger, gives me energy, and best of all giving me a great figure. Try it..I'm living proof that Lipoxinol actually works!"
3,who was that boy,it is a really cute series about first loves. if you are looking for some simple romance stories this is the anime for you. but i thought it was funny that they never show the face of the boys that these girls love. each story is an episode unto it self. the art work and music are ok. all around not a bad series but not a great one either.
2,Big Noses,"This set contains twelve different stories about twelve different girls, and every one of them has an ugly nose. Imagine twelve girls who look like Bob Hope and you get the idea. Not for weak stomachs."
5,Amazing story not told on the news,"This is an amazing story of hope and peace not told in the news. Some amazing testimonies in this DVD. When you see this, you will want to share it with everyone you know."
5,Perfect Fit,No trouble at all and the box has 3 of them just in case you mess one up during dipstick tube installation which tends to be tricky.
5,Best since Parshall's Resurrection File,"Craig Parshall weaves an excellent tale blending history, fiction and Biblical truth. In recent years Christian Fiction has become a boone to the literary industry. Books and stories published by many are thin and underdeveloped reading more like witnessing tracts than novels. I urge anyone with a liking for Grisham to pick up Parshall."
1,1 star = too high,Don't waste your money on this. I am not sure wy this was ever printed in the first place. Atrociously bad.
1,Turned our soap rusty brown,"This is a beautiful soap dispenser. However, the pump rusted and turned our clear soap a disgusting brown within a few weeks. The plastic body isn't marked recyclable, so I'm sadly throwing it away."
5,Sunsei Solar Charger 135mA (2watt),"EXCELLENT Product !!! I have two of these & a third larger Sunsei solar charger model on my 33' boat. Because my boat is on a swing mooring (i.e. without shore power), these 3 units safetly keep all 3 battries on my boat in optimum condition & fully charged. We get temperatures ranging from 6C to 55C (Centigrade...yes very HOT) here in Dubai & these solar chargers have been working well for the last 2 years. Would highly reccomend them (several of my mates have purchased these as well - great value) !!!"
3,Works,Packaging: OKVisual Defects: NoneInstallation: EasySuction Cup: Bit weakButton to Check if adequate sunlite is available: Very goodPerformance: OKTried on BMW 525i
4,Not bad - sticks out a bit too much for me,"I am using this in my car, and was planning to use it with a charger that is located in the center column - but it stuck out a bit too much. So I'm using it in the normal ""ash-tray"" charger.As a USB charger it seems to work as advertised."
5,Well Worth It,"Works great, no problems so far charging phones, mp3 players, etc. The blue power LED can be annoying if it happens to be pointed at you due to where your lighter is located, but a little electrical tape fixes that."
5,Fun,This game is fun to play. It's for car fans. Control is fantastic. Graphic is very good. You have to try this out. I am not selling mine. Keeping it until I find a better one.
1,"A tiresome chore to read, and an imposition","There IS the kernel of a compelling story here; unfortunately, Mr. McKnight fails abysmally in his attempt to tell it. The writing is frequently flat and uninspired, and the overly descriptive, pseudo-surrealistic prose kills the story's momentum. A crashing bore."
5,Not just for Oriental menues,Great tasting noodles and can be used with any recipe calling for pasta. I used them in Italian recipes in place of linguine and it was a nice change.
3,bang-around durability?,"This is really a nice pan, and a good value for your money. The sides are faily thin though so I am not sure how durable it is. Time will tell. The slender handle is also a matter of personal taste. It it designed for use with a kitchen towel as they do in proffesional kitchens."
4,Way of the samurai is an underrated game,"Way of the samurai is a game that i looked over for small little mishaps but overall is a very good game. It give a new feature of fighting that is so life-like that it leaves games such as Dynasty Warriors in the dust. It gives you a solid story lines that are enjoyable to play over and over again. The detail of the Weapons is marvelous and they give you a reason to play it again. My only critisisms are the camera the lack of characters to select from the short gameplay, and the grunts for words"
3,Not worth $50,"A great idea with a not so great execution.There was a lot of potential here, its a shame that the quality control wasn't better.The save system is terrible. Because when you die the game is over. Even after you beat the game and you win many swords and moves, if you die the next time you play, you lose everything. The game is basically unplayable without two memory cards (as a backup).This game would be worth it if it costs about $20."
3,Good...but only a rental,"This game does have some cool features...i mean the swords, the whole samurai concept, the fighting system..all great. But who wants to spend more than $10 on a game that takes 30 minutes to beat? Maybe i missed something, but that is how long it took me to save everybody, and get the ending. Dunno why you would buy this..."
2,Could be cool if wasn't so short,"I was happy playing this game when all of a sudden I realized I had finished it. This was after 3 hours with some of that time spent in the training mode to learn to fight. Story was nice, just way too short."
2,No Solutions Leaves Us In The Mommy Trap,"I couldn't agree more that ""Perfect Madness"" doesn't help anyone. I have read a lot of books on similar subjects and the only one that is different is ""How To Avoid The Mommy Trap,"" by Julie Shields. Some mothers are like the ones in ""Perfect Madness"" and some mothers and fathers overparent, but we don't have to. Perfect Madness starts several levels behind the ""Mommy Trap"" and never catches up. If you're not part of the solution, you're part of the problem, a truism that is especially true for mothers stuck somewhere they don't want to be or somewhere that is not good for their families or themselves."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"I borrowed this book from a fellow ""mommy"" and am so happy I didn't buy it, as the book is unreadable. Its nearly impossible to believe that the Ms Warner makes her living as an writer, as the book is repetitive, rambling and nearly totally without focus. Apparently, every mother in America is miserable (someone forget to send the memo to the moms I know). Ms. Warner does bring up one or two good points--good daycare and medical care is far too difficult to find and the demands of high-paying,high-status jobs often are incompatible with family life, she fails to develop them, posit any solutions, or even present the issues in an organized manner."
1,She is a Parody of Her Ownself,"Judith Warner says that motherhood is too full of stress, anxiety and finger-pointing but she proselytizes that we are all doing it all wrong. Does anyone else see the contradiction?Warner says that she could more successfully handle motherhood and a career -- she could do it all -- if only she had more help. Does anyone else see the contradiction?Warner says that motherhood is unbearably hard. Isn't absolutely anything worthwhile unbearably hard? (As well as tremendously rewarding, exhilarating, fun and challenging...)Warner needs to understand the choices she is making as a mother, writer and woman... and live with them -- enjoy them. I was a career professional and am now totally happy and content raising my children. I choose to be happy raising my own children.This book is a disservice to our generation."
4,Excellent poetry of wide appeal,"Though the poetry of the great medieval kingdom of Al-Andalus is well known to scholars and historians of that civilization, it's too little known among general readers in the western world. In this book, Cola Franzen has translated several score mostly brief poems of the period from the Spanish translations of the Arabic done by Emilio Garcia Gomez. I don't have the languages to evaluate them as translations, but I think any reader of the English will be delighted with the result: these poems are clear, vivid, courtly, elegant, passionate, and of great general appeal. For anyone particularly interested in Al-Andalus, this is a must have book, and can also be strongly recommended to readers of poetry in general."
2,Not a lot of detail,Very short easy read book. Interesting but for the factually inclined there was not much to go on. Interesting nevertheless
5,Very talented and very good album,Alex Bach is not only good she rocks and she looks good and she sings wonderful. Her lyrics are easy to understand and connect with. Alex makes you feel better when you feel sad.
4,Mary Kay Lipstick Liners,"Everything was great except one of the pencils did not work and I had to throw it away. Other than that, I was thrilled to finally find these."
5,I Thought I Was a Cult of One . . .,"... but apparently there are lots of other Boylan fans out there. Boylan's music is as satisfying as the early work of other California icons, like Warren Zevon and Ned Doheny. The music is deliciously mellow, but barbed with tart lyrics and sharp rhythms that snatch the listener from blissful reverie. Steely Dan and Jackson Browne are obvious influences. His last two albums in their entirety would have fit perfectly on one CD (and they all deserve to be heard). Unfortunately, they don't all appear here. On the other hand, this CD contains a few new recordings, something fans haven't had from Boylan in a quarter of a century. According to his website, Boylan, who owns Spinnaker Records and a publishing company, is recording new material. Let's hope it's true. Meanwhile, we'll be dreaming of ""big palm dates"" and ""iguanas climbing the villa walls"" on the Florida coast. Jimmy Buffett eat your heart out."
2,Moves Along Quickly But Very Predictable,"While I'm not sorry I read ""Something Dangerous"", all in all, my recommendation to you would be to skip to ""something else"". Redmond's first effort moves along quickly and generally holds your attention. However, there is little depth to the characters, and there is little suspense because you'll be able to guess what happens well before it actually occurs. Upon finishing Something Dangerous I, at first, thought I'd make a great detective, given that I was able to predict almost all of the events that happened. But then I realized that this book was just not very good."
2,Dissapointing,"What promised to be an exploratory novel of the haunting side of British school system life of mid-century turned into a rather lame horror novel of unleashed ""evil"" power. The first half of the book, despite some trite language and cheesy dialogue, had intensity and the potential to develop a frightfully wonderful relationship. I had originally seen it's British publishing as The Wishing Game, and the marketing on that and the American version leads one to believe it is going to further that relationship to a potentially murderous level, but it veers from the Heavenly Creatures route to something akin to teen occult films like The Craft. It's prologue and epilogue structure were also rather tired, and technically present questions about plot holes and knowledge when fitted against the story line, but can be ignored. I just offer these quick thoughts as an alternative to the rave reviews others have posted, just so you have a broader scope before going ahead and getting it."
2,Could take it or leave it...,"I read rave reviews of this on Makeupalley and thought I would give it a shot. The mask seems to work to help smooth out rough or dry lips. The balm is...well, lame. It feels fairly waxy and just not the best balm by any stretch of the imagination. It does not last all night either if you put it on before bed. C.O. Bigelow 8 hour overnight lip balm is far superior to this. This is definitely NOT amazing or the best or any of the other words used in other reviews to describe it. Maybe if you have ""normal"" lips and not super dry lips, it is great...but if you need it to help with a dry lip problem, this product is just not what it is hyped up to be."
1,Buyers Beware!,Buyers Beware. Once I got this game and installed it it would not run on my machine. Try to contact vender for support and contact information is not up to date. Therefore I am stuck buying software that will not work and no support. Amazon should get rid of this vendor.
3,Pretty OK actually,"Eye of pain was a half decent adventure and it ties in well with Eye of Doom and Eye to Eye. I felt the plotline is good in the way it builds up to the finale in Eye to Eye but it could be fleshed out just a little bit more. Its not to good, but its not too bad either. I enjoyed it none the less and so did most of the other players. I, Tyrant is not nessecery in my opinion but provides a valueable background sourcebook for this adventure. Recommended for all lovers of giant spell-casting eyeballs."
5,Reviewing the Vacu Vin WineMaster Corkscrew,"We owned a ""Vacu Vin WineMaster Corkscrew"" for years and finally wore it out! It is the easiest corkscrew to use in the market (in my opinion). My wife always had problems with the traditional corkscrews but can work the Vacu Vin easily. It is sturdy and durable. It's just the BEST!"
5,Unique Mechanism,I enjoy this product for its unusual method of extracting a cork. I collect corkscrews and wanted to add this to my collection. It work great. It is very easy to operate and would be ideal for ladies and those who have difficulty using more traditional corkscrews.
4,Very Nice Product,"This Practice pad is one of the best Practice pads i have played on. Definitely worth the money i paid for. This practice pad contains two sides, The Grey soft rubber side with a great bounce to it, and The black side with a harder rubber used to build your ""Chops"". It may be a little big and heavy but that's good. Anyways i recommend this product to anyone."
4,Does the job- but not in 5 minutes,"Although it does take a little longer to chill a bottle of wine ( in about 10 minutes, not 5 ), this product is still amazingly convenient! It really does work on a bottle of room temperature wine AND when left on, it keeps the bottle cold at the dinner table. I plan on buying more to give as gifts."
5,Great gift! Really works!,"I was ordering a wedding gift and came upon this item. Even though it seemed unlikely that this product could actually chill a bottle of wine in minutes, I bought one for the present and one for myself. I am so glad that I did! I use it ALL THE TIME! We were always wishing that we had a chilled bottle around when unexpected friends stopped by or just for last minute fun. Now that is no problem. I even got a call from the newlyweds, who thanked me for the wine chiller, but didn't mention the rest of the gift! Rather inexpensive for such rave reviews!"
4,A Good Book,It has everything you need to know about Networking Programming in Python. Easy to understand also. It can be made more detail and more advance for profesional use.
3,"Good book, but way too many mistakes","This is a great book to flip through, but the errors are unbelievable. Does anyone think it is really possible that Jari Kurri shot 61.4% in 1986-87. 54 goals on 88 shots? Someone should have checked this over before it got printed. I've found at least 10 more errors/typos in here as well."
5,"Prompt service, product as expected","This item came promptly and was just as expected. The box containing the towelettes was a little smashed, but it had no effect on the product inside."
5,Life saver,"Recommend it for kayaking. It will not get lost if properly install. Don't have to worry about cutting your self in an emergency , safe to use."
3,hard to get on,these seem to run a little small and are very hard to get on because the z strap doesn't allow it to open up very much.
5,Good Moisturizer,I have skin that is prone to breakout in pimples and this moisturizer works great to prevent that. It is not greasy and has very little fragrance. It is bit pricey so I have gone to a similar generic brand that works as well.
3,Fascinating Look @ Tools,"This is a wonderful look at woodworking tools used today and in the past. The development of the tools from different parts of the world is most informative. I am stumbling into some of the tools in my own shop and it is good to know what they are and how they are used. The picture illustrations are plentiful and well-done. If you don't own any of the tools when you get the book, you sure will want to by the time you put the book down."
2,Ecellent Service,The product was in excellent shape as dicribed shipped quickly...It just was not as good as expected.
4,Vacuum Wine Saver Stoppers,These savers are very efective as vacuum stopers to help preserve opened botles of wine.
3,A fairly good pop-up book.,"This is a National Geographic pop-up book that gives information about giraffes, ostriches, elephants, hippos, crocodiles, and gorillas. There are a few flaps to look under and figures to move, but mainly just things that pop-up. Some of the information is good for kids to know, but some of it is unnecessary. (For example, it tells of crocodiles preying on baby hippos that stray from their mothers.) My kids had fun with the flaps and action figures. Despite their love for animals, this was not one of their favorites."
4,"Not always ""EZ Up"" but does the job well","Despite the name, this canopy does not always go up easily, but if you have 2 (and better yet, 3 or 4) adults to set it up, you should be good to go. Watch out for pinched fingers on the poles! Other than that, though, it's great -- wonderful instant shade."
2,Is not 12x12!,"Just bought this and tried to fit a 12x12 screen to it. Turns out this is actually 11'x11', so if you want to install a screen with it, you're out of luck. I'm returning mine."
4,a week at Ocean City NJ,"fantastic product - yes it measures 12x12 from the base of the slanted legs - if you want a bigger canopy - then find another. Very easy to put up and take-down. Possible for one person (although you would need to be patient with yourself) quite easy with two - and gets even easier with three or four people. We took it to the beach early in the morning - claimed our spot - went back to the house for breakfast and returned for 7+ hours. This canopy makes great shade - we secure it with 15"" augers that we also found on amazon and zip ties and then we mound sand around it - it isn't going anywhere. As I watched umbrellas fly away all day or beach-goers holding on to them for dear life - I sat relaxed and peaceful knowing that the E-Z Up Sierra II 12 by 12 wouldn't budge. Great shade for the 10month old baby and for 4 adults without being on top of one another."
1,Customer Service is an oxymoron at ezup,"oxymoron: a combination of contradictory or incongruous words. Pretty much says it all. I e-mailed, no response, I went on their website and sent a message, no response. I called, got someone who told me that he couldn't find my e-mail in their system but if I would resend to him he could help. At long last he said it was in the denied pile. I asked why no one responded. Didn't know, guy wasn't in and he would get back to me. Still have not heard back. Oh, the best part, if the wind is blowing at all, you have no warranty at all. Acts of God are not covered. Can someone let me know where exactly the wind never blows?"
4,E-Z UP Sierra II 12X12 Canopy,"I order this for my son in Seattle, Wa for Christmas. Very good price and quality construction. He has used this canopy at games and camping and is very satified. Shipped directly to my son with no problems. This is the way transactions should take place, good job Amazon."
3,none,"Seems ok so far , only set it up one time when I received it, was little confusing at first, but once up appears to be a fairly good product. will know more when I start using it on the beach."
3,Good Frame - Thin Top,Good solid frame and handy pin to close corners. The top was good protection but very thin and light. At the beach it would have flown away. I added grommets and attached it to the frame. Then excellent.
5,Great product,"It really is E-Z up. After the initial set up, you understand how it works. We find that once it is spread out, if one person stands in the center and gently pushes up on the roof braces, the other person can manuever the locking pins into place and adjust the legs much easier and faster. We had read the other reviews before purchasing it and they were very helpful. Taking it down is just as easy.It was a very good investment and the price was right. We checked out other web sites for prices, but Amazon beat everyone.Thank youSteve"
3,Side panels,I wish there were side panels available to keep out the wind. Otherwise the Sierre ll was Ok when we used it
3,It's not all you might want.,"I chose SiteSpinner because it seemed to receive the best reveiws of all the web editing software. I needed to get some good software because I am a beginner at creating and editing web sites, and because I have an existing web site that was created by another person, and that person no longer has the time or desire to update my web site. Thus, I got SiteSpinner. Sadly, SiteSpinner failed to do the very first thing I wanted it to do: ""Edit and update my existing website."" Simply put, it can NOT edit or update any web site that was made with any software other than SiteSpinner. About the only thing it can do is to create a brand new web site. So, if you're looking for software to use to update your existing website, SiteSpinner is not the software you should be looking for. Further, you should make sure that whatever software you get will be capable of editing the website that you might already have."
1,Not compatible with HTML,I have a website with HTML pages prepared by the obsolete Frontpage 2003. SiteSpinner is not compatible with HTML and in another format where I cannot import my old pages to update. I have hundreds of pages and cannot start over. How about a warning to ;potential buyers?
5,Best site builder,"Before buying SiteSpinner I had struggled to set up a website for myself. I attended two short courses, signed up for a distance learning package and sampled other similar webbuilding programs. SiteSpinner is absolutely the best I tried. I presently have three sites out there, all designed using SiteSpinner. I am very proud of my achievement.The support that SiteSpinner provide is also excellent and quick in response times.I cannot praise it highly enough.BTW I signed up for a sample period of SiteSpinner after reading other reviews where it was described as user friendly. It really is. And I bought it well within the free sample period I was so impressed."
5,"Great, easy to use and comprehensive must have tool!",I love the fact that an old blonde accountant can build a website without any formal training and achieve a good looking result. Very easy to use and worth much more than the couple of $ (even after converting it to South African Rands) I recommend it for anyone who is tired of sponsoring overpaid web developers!
