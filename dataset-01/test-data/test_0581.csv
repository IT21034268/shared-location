1,battery issue,I purchased one for me and one for my husband. As another reviewer noted these do not work with the new Duracell batteries I have tried. VERY FRUSTRATING!!!
2,Disappointed,"Not up to MSR standards, the latching tab broke on the spoon the first time I folded it. The utensils are very flimsy and will not stand up to camp use. Would have been better if they didn't fold."
2,not surdy,"not sturdy at all- was hoping to use as my utensils on a sailboat to save space, but no way could you cook or stir anything heavier than maybe 1 egg."
2,All scratched up,"I used a metal spatula on this to make fried rice. It's all scratched up now. I've owned other griddles and nonstick cookware that have been fine with metal spatulas. Oh, well."
2,double burner griddle,This griddle only had two reviews when I foolishly bought it! Its handle interfere with it properly sitting on my ceramic cooktop. It does have a smooth bottom which is essential for a cermaic cooktop. That is the only good thing I have found about this griddle. The handles are too large and will not allow it to sit properly on the cooktop so that it cannot heat evenly. It wasn't very expensive and is rather light in construction which goes to prove you get what you pay for. I have the Frigidaire professionals series stove so....if you have the same stove do not get this griddle!
2,Warped on first use,"Using for the first time I followed the labeled directions and set the two burners and bridge element at medium low heat and the griddle pan (which initially sat perfectly flat on the stove top) warped from corner to corner creating a wobble of about half an inch by the time it was warm enough to brown a grilled cheese sandwich. Not terribly effective for a flat top range. When cooled the pan regained some of it's original shape but still has about a quarter of an inch of wobble from corner to corner. Very disappointing. The label indicated that it was safe up to 350 degrees but mine warped well below that temperature. Too bad, it's a nice looking piece of cookware and the padded handles are a nice feature but worthless if you can't use it."
1,So slow and outdated,"THE BACKGROUND - This video looks more dated than it actually is. Its only from 2002, but it looks like its from the 70's with the gradient in the background. The background in this video looks like she's in heaven or outer space.THE PACE - So slow...the talking is slow and the pace is slow. The voice is so boring.THE ORGANIZATION - This video is soo long 75 minutes. It should've been broken up into segments, especially since its soo slow paced.THE VOICEOVER- I don't like videos where the person isn't talking in real time, they are talking as the voiceover. She does the voiceover most of the time, then she goes on talking in real time. She should just stick to one or the other.This video was very weird to me. Personally, this was the worst yoga dvd I have ever watched."
1,Terrible,"This is absolutely terrible. Not inspiring, motivating or fun, just feels like a waste of time."
5,Love the Brady Bunch and Loved this Book and Barry for Writing It.,"If you love the Brady Bunch or even just the era it was made in ....buy this book! Barry did a great job taking me behind the scenes of the show and really presents a fair picture of the attempts of Robert Reed to make a show we would all love and Sherwood who would make a show we would all love.....I tended to side with Robert Reed mostly but being from an actual large 8 sibling family myself I can say some of the mixtures of comedy genres more than fit the situations. We'd probably still be watching the Brady's grow up if Sherwood would have listened to Bob a little more and Bob would have listened to Sherwood a little more. This show wasn't that candy coated, it really did match what me and my brothers and sisters were going through only without the swearing and the smoking and the drinking...but HBO wasn't invented yet!"
1,Dull and outdated,"I did not notice the date on the video - it is made in 1961. The photographs are good, and the fairy tale connection interesting. But the narrator (actress Marlene Dietrich) seems dull and monotonous, and the narration is too basic/does not capture the viewer's interest. A book on the holocaust or a more contemporary documentary of the same subject is recommended to this."
5,Dutch Cooking,It is a great collection of Dutch recipes. Dutch cooking is not a widely known cruisine and this book will introduce it to more people. Being part Dutch I really enjoyed it and used many of the recipes.
3,Doesn't work with TiVo,"This version of the HW doesn't work with the latest Series 2 TiVo. I ordered one, plugged it in, and it doesn't work. TiVo simply doesn't recognize the USB device is plugged in at all."
4,nice boz find,"i hadn't listened to any boz scaggs for a while and found this cruising though amazon. it was a pleasant rediscovery for me as the playing is soulful as well as thoughtful without being overly commercial ..after all these years boz' voice still sounds good, and it's a pleasure to enjoy his take on the blues. if you haven't listened to any boz lately,maybe even forgot about him like i did, i think you might like this effort as a reminder of what really made boz an excellent musician and performer."
2,Expiration date; poor service,"Please be aware of two things about Virgin pre-paid:1) Each top-up card has an expiration date. If you are unlucky like I was last time, you might get a card that expires a couple days after you receive it, and then if you didn't notice, you'd be screwed out of $50.2) Don't count on Virgin to help you. Their customer service sucks. Long wait times, unhelpful service reps, and just annoying website.If there's a 7-11 in your neighborhood, you may want to check out their Speak-Up prepaid service, which is cheaper and has better phones, plus your balance is good for one whole year (as opposed to 3 months with Virgin)."
1,I would give negative stars if I could.,"Do NOT do business with these people. They charge you out the nose for their service, then they have all these rules and such to basically charge you for things you are not using, then refuse to pay you back. These jerks are taking advantage of kids, teenagers, and young people who can't afford a regular cell phone. I am on a mission to tell people how bad this is. Keep it in mind before you buy any of their products."
4,Near perfection but alas puzzle pieces missing,the saint was a truly terrific take on the hit 60s tv show starring Roger Moore. The soundtrack really captures the essence of eastern europe chill music with 6 underground and Dream within a Dream. if it werent for the missing tracks from the Carrs and the Smashing Pumpkins this soundtrack would be literal gold.
3,Its not bad,"I bought this CD thinking in some songs I heard in the film, many of them appears on the soundtrack, yes, (like the main title, the best of the album). But others themes, like the one that appears in the film when they are children, and the boy rescues a girl...it is not in the soundtrack! That one has no voices, and a little of arabic, in the style, I mean. If anybody knows where can I find it, please, contact me in ageyepes@hotmail.com. The rest of the soundtrack its not bad, but I dont like that kind of music..."
3,Could have been better.,"This book is helpful to a certain degree, but I much prefer Mary Pride's books.I appreciate Cathy Duffy's section on learning styles, but got frustrated at the layout of the book. It's not very easy to read. Not very user-friendly and the whole book is rather dull. Also, what I truly wish is that she would have gone into FAR more detail with regards to SPECIFIC learning styles and SPECIFIC products. She does this to a certain degree, but it's all rather cursory. Her review and the whole book, therefore, seems as if it's incomplete."
2,Very big but short of ideas,"I ordered this book hoping it'll give me some fresh and new ideas for designing. I am very dissapointed, because what I've got is not more than 330 pages of outdated, temporary designs. Pretty much 330 of its 374 pages are filled with the same of what I call ""typical american design from 90-95"". So if you look at it that way, this book is way overpriced for 40 good pages."
1,Cannot Update - No Help from Tech Support,"I installed this product and registered it with no problem. However, it would not connect to the internet to update the software components, such as antivirus definitions. I am not a tech wizard, but it seems a poor design to be able to access the internet to register the product, but not be able to do so to update it. I made two calls to tech support, who took me through numeropus machinations and restarts, which resulted in nothing but a commitment that a higher level tech rep would get back to me. 12 hours later, no one has. So much for vaunted customer service. After wasting several hours and $40, I went back to Norton. Maybe it isn't as sleek as PC-cillin, but it works."
1,It does not work and the help line is useless,"I have tried to install the software several times and it only freezes my computer. The help line is not very useful and I am trying now to get my money back. By the way, they have never paid me the promised rebates."
2,Hard to update,"When I click the ""update components"", I'm continually told that ""the feature is still initializing, please try again later"". This will happen even if I've had the program open for hours. I've contacted trend micro, followed their instructions for a workaround, but that still didn't help."
5,Excellent Product,"It was rated high when I bought it, and it works well. I had a minor problem installing it, but I got it working okay by myself. The ratings for product support was excellent; but, when I wrote an e-mail requesting help, I never received a reply. Maybe it got lost in the mail????????However, I've installed it on both of my machines, and it's much better than Norton, and I got a great rebate on one of them....total cost about $16.00."
2,spend more,"This thing works okay but feels flimsy. It's mostly plastic. Next time I'll buy a more expensive faucet, perhaps brass."
4,The only thing that would make it perfect...,"I'd LOVE to have something like this, IF they put an atomic clock in it! It would be everything I've always wanted in a clock! <sigh>"
3,Pretty good but no great,I spilled a 3 foot square area of paint of the side walk and a bunch of little paint droppings. It took out the small stuff but didn't remove all of the large area. Good but not as great as I hoped for.
1,100% American Made Soybean? More like N-methyl pyrrolidone,"I started to show interest in this product based on reviews and the name, Soy-Gel, and the claim that it uses 100% American made soybeans. But after reading the MSDS (Material Safety Data Sheet) I found out that the active ingredient is N-methyl pyrrolidone which is a chemical solvent that is used for many purposes including paint strippers.Apparantly soy beans can't quite do the job by itself, but it goes a long way in marketing this product.Needless to say I am not going to buy this product. As noted in another review this product contains a chemical known to the state of California to cause birth defects or other reproductive harm."
4,Corelle Abundance Teakettle,The teakettle arrived and I was taken back by the size. It is much smallerthan the kettles I have had before. But it is so decorative and fits well withmy decor and does the job of heating water just fine. The handle is sturdyand hopefully it will not pit inside overtime. I am pleased with the purchaseand will enjoy my tea with the cooler weather coming.
1,Not worth it,I purchased this adapter based on reviews. I made sure that my electronics met the criteria and the first time I used it it shorted out and was unusable after that. Wonderful waste of $30
2,NOT A VOLTAGE CONVERTER!,"This is a plug adapter only, not a voltage converter. This was not clear in the advertising. My only clue was the sticker across the plug holes that said, YOU NEED A CONVERTER to use this! GEEZ. Keep shopping. Find a converter/plug adapter kit instead."
1,Does Not Convert Voltage!!!,"This is a fairly useless device. It does not convert voltage, and since most other countries use 220 volts, you will simply destroy your shaver or cell phone if you use this.This fact should be prominantly advertised, and it is not."
4,Music Teacher Gift,"Given as a gift to each of my co-music teachers, this book was a big hit at Christmas, especially after a stressful music season....and it didn't cost much :-). I bought one for myself too, and have a good chuckle every time I pick it up a read a bit."
1,Terrible,"This is a terrible product for little girls. I'll give you my full opinion on Bratz. They are big headed, snap on foot dolls with skinny bodys and ugly, bratty faces!! Barbie and My Scene is way better!"
1,Disappointing,"This book bored me. The writing style is fresh for about 6 pages, then sags. I read on-line that its purpose might have been more of as a grudge against certain musicians than as a novel attempt. This kind of half fiction, half based on truth only works some times. I sure wish I'd known that before buying it!"
5,The best album you've never heard,"Brigette McWilliams came back in 1997 with this extermely slept-on and under-promoted album, Too Much Woman (she dropped a so-so debut album in 1994). She will automatically remind you of Chaka Khan, but that's because her mother Paulette McWilliams used to sing with Rufus before Chaka joined them and members of that band play on this album. It makes no sense to critique any one song because all of them are excellent (you probably saw the video, ""Morning"" on BET's Midnight Love). I'm glad that Brigette skipped all of the hip-hop/R&B funk from her first album and geared to the neo-soul sound that was more respected back then; now the genre is heavily criticized. It's a shame that neither of her albums were big sellers. If Virgin Records, her label, weren't so busy promoting Janet Jackson that year, then maybe Brigette would have gotten some recognition. Now she may never get another chance in the music business."
3,Not his best,Alhough the sex scenes are great there isnt much of a plot.This is not his best book. Adultery and abuse make for a sad story...
2,Worst EJD Book Ever!,"I just finished reading ""Genevieve"" and hated it! It was very slow to arrive for me and didn't pick up until the very end. EJD has adopted a new style full of poetic writing and scenery that just don't capture the reader's attention. It will probably sell well just because of who he is, but get ready to be grossly dissappointed. With Zane, Teri McMillan, E. Lynn Harris and other up and coming African-American novelists, he's going to have to do a lot better than this to stay in the game."
2,Hit or miss.....miss,"This is the third one of his books that just missed the bull's eye. It was like reading through the fog of smoke that Genevieve was constantly trying to escape in. The book jumped around too much and just did not allow for focus. I must admit that it kept me reading because I wanted to see what in the world would cause so many problems in this woman's life that she was constantly trying to escape from. The opening made the book seem like it was going to be so much more, but it was filled with dysfunction. To be more understandable it should have been written end, beginning middle, not middle, beginning end as it is written. The Kenya shocker was great though, it came just as I was about to totally write off the book."
5,YOU WILL NOT PUT IT DOWN,"If you have read any book by Eric J. Dickey, you know he is one of the best writers in this century. This book is one of his best works and if you havent already bought the book, you are missing out on a great story. How Dickey manages to speak from a woman's point of view, I will never understand. As usual, the ending makes you want to read the book again."
4,Love the twists and turns,"I really enjoyed the character developments in this book. You start to develop your own opinions of Genevieve. And even though you may never do what she did, you completely understand where she is coming from. And the plot twists were nice. He did a great job on switching things up. My only problem with this book is at time it did seem to drag on a little. Kind boring, filler type reading every now and again. But overall, a great book. People need to ignore who the author is and read the book for what it is. Sometimes they change styles, but read the book as is. Not everything is going to fit the mold that you place it in."
3,I wasn't felling it,The guy slept with the chicks daughter. I couldn't get past that. But yet genevieve says it was her fault. In what planet does Jerome think this would ever happen. I assure you this would never happen on the planet earth.
3,"Eric, Eric",This started off slow for me but picked up about halfway through. Eric is a really good writer and I'm glad to see he is doing different things with his stories. I'd recommend this book.
2,"well written, gramatically perfect, but depressing.","this book is made by disasters. there are very few happy parts, and there is no way that they can cancel out the sad. I know very well that the setting wasn't happy, but it waas still depressing. would not reccomend it, as it is fiction. if it were non-fiction, it would rank a lot higher, but it isn't."
5,easy cheap way to take iron,"As a professional runner, taking iron is a must, this is the most cost effective and effective way to take iron just mix with a little oj to help absorption."
4,The CD title does not lie,"This is a great Compilation CD of the R&B group After Seven. With the help of babyface, they put together quite a few fantastic songs. The CD sounds great, the quality and choice of songs are perfect. From start to finish, this Disc will keep you in the mood of love and happiness. Great CD to have playing for a romantic night. Thank you After Seven for some great songs.My top 5 tracks:Baby I'm for realCan he love u like thisGonna love you rightSara smileOne night"
4,Agriculture with Attitude!,"Mr. Logsdon's wisdom and simple common sense (not so common anymore!) give all us ""Contrarians"" a little support. In a world of full of farmers that follow the edicts of the chemical-company-supported extension services and consultants it is a relief to hear from someone who does it the old fashioned way, which is the only way for a farmer without thousands of acres and millions of dollars to succeed.A great primer on the foolish basis for our economic system which ignores the primary industry of any civilization: farming.My only reservations came from personal biases that we don't share. I don't really fault him for these things, it just made me value the book a shade less.I have passed it on to my most ""contrary"" friends who have an interest in farming or the earth."
3,Best option,"Its amazing to me that this is the best option out there for balcony safety. Its expensive, ugly, difficult to install, but it does what its intended to do. I hate looking at it in my house but i no longer feel nervous when my 1 1/2 year old is playing upstairs. So it is necessary."
2,BOOOOOOOORING!!!!!,I couldn't even finish reading the second story in Twilight Girls! I felt like I was walking through MUD to get to the ending! Just not what I expected!
5,Amazing,"I used Soy Gel to strip the paint off of woodwork in my dining room. Glob it on like a thick paint and walk away. A few hours later I nudged the paint with a putty knife. The strip of paint fell off the wood. It has a very mild odor and it doesn't irritate my skin.I've used other paint removers that were such noxious messes i was really reluctant to try this, I'm glad I did. It also seems far more effective than other strippers so a gallon of Soy Gel will strip the same amount of paint as 2+ gallons of the other stuff. That makes it pretty cost effective. Add in the cost of expensive stripping gloves and it comes out about even. I wear free disposable hair coloring gloves with this stuff.I wish I had tried this earlier!"
4,"Good, but not their best","I enjoyed House, but there are other books by Peretti & Dekker I'd rate above this one (like Monster, Obsessed, The Circle Trilogy & Thr3e).If you are a fan of Peretti and/or Dekker, don't miss it, but don't expect it to be the best ever and you won't be disappointed."
1,Religious Horror,Every hackneyed horror cliche is trotted out. The writing is third rate. The ending had overt Christian overtones. The 'loose' woman is evil for having casual sex ( she pays the price for THAT lifestyle) and a child of God appears to help fight the devil.
1,Is Frank Peretti Really a Christian,"I have tried to read a few of Mr. Perettis books and just don't get them. His books go directly against Phillipians which tells us to think on those things which are true, noble, right, pure, lovely, admirable, excellent or praiseworthy. I couldn't get past the second chapter, it repulsed me. If you are a Christian, don't waste your money or time. Do not be conformed to the patterns of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind!"
5,Personification of Evil,This tale beautifully explores the ideas of good versus evil in realistic views. It doesn't explain the two in obscurities but lays the truth and deceit in the minds of everyone who reads it as the characters explore the personified evils of their own lives.
1,Shockingly bad,"As much as I've enjoyed both Peretti's and Dekker's other novels, I expected House to be better written. I didn't like it from the beginning, but kept reading, thinking, ""It HAS to get better."" It didn't; it got worse. I love to read and enjoy almost everything I read. This book was an exception and a waste of my time. If you like shallow, empty characters that you only get the barest glimpse of; and BORING, sometimes confusing, repetitive ""action,"" you'll love this book. The awfulness of this book has nothing to do with its being a Christian fiction novel (try Peretti's ""This Present Darkness""/""Piercing the Darkness"" for awesome stories; or Dekker's ""Blink""); it's the plot (there IS one, but the action is really lame), characters that are unlikable and dull, details that either make no sense or don't add to the story, and a complete lack of satisfaction from reading the story."
1,Could and did put it down.,"I really did want to like this book. I had never read anything by either of the authors before, but had heard so many good things about both that I found myself continually surprised at how bad the writing was, and how cardboard the characters were. I didn't care about any of them. It's really hard to feel for any character when none of them seem developed enough for you to care whether they live or die. I guess I see how this could be suspenseful for someone who's never read a suspense novel before, but I couldn't even finish, because it felt like a waste of my time. Sorry authors. I won't give up on the authors, but I'll be sure to read some reviews first."
2,Disappointing,This book appeared to have what would be an somewhat interesting plot. There was some suspense and then it just kept dragging on and on. It then got just plain weird and not entertaining at all. Here's one for the donation pile.
2,from SNB,"The beginning of this book was intriguing and made me want to read on, but the ending was totally confusing. I felt the ending third of the book was too long and too boring. I found myself skipping over big portions because I just didn't get it. This supernatural genre is one of my favorites, Stephen King's books in particular, but this one does not compare. Too odd.I would not recommend this book to my friends."
1,Complete waste of time,"The book reminded me of something that would have been written by a teenager that was just testing out their new writing abilities. After the first few chapters, I painfully choked through the rest of the book trying not to give up too soon, only to read over the last sentence and realize that ""benefit of the doubt"" is not always the wisest choice. The plot was highly underdeveloped, as well as the characters. The dialogue was hideous. All in all, this is the worst book I have ever read. If you have never read any books by these authors (which was my case) then I suggest finding something else to start off. If you have read these authors, I suggest just forgetting the existence of this book just to defend yourself from amazing disappointment. As in the popular show ""Reading Rainbow"", I will quote Lamar and say ""But don't take my word for it."" However, don't say I didn't try to warn you."
3,Poor effort,"I love all things Peretti so I was really looking forward to this book. I've only read ""Three"" by Dekker (which I didn't like) so I wasn't sure what to expect. I guess what little expectations I had were to high.The book has a great concept and starts off really strong but ends up treading water halfway through. The characters seemed really shallow and the writting style does not flow very well, which I would guess is a result of having two guys working on it.The part I was most disappointed in was the ending. There was no twist which everyone claims it has and the in your face spirituality at the end of the book also seems very over the top and forced. Not Peretti's best book at all. I will not be reading anymore Dekker either.If you want to read this book, I'd suggest you borrow it from a friend. It's worth a read but not a purchase."
4,MUST BE FINISHED TO BE APPRECIATED,"It begins very slow, but it is one of those books that must be read all the way throught the end, It must be read through to be undestood and apreciated. I had never read a book with an ending so surprising as this one. I read through it thinking it was going to have a predictable ending, but it was a great surprise. I truly recomend it! But be prepared for some slow parts and some confusing ones also."
1,Couldn't Have Been Ted Dekker's,There's no way Ted Dekker wrote this one. Yuk! He's such a great riter!! But this one is terrible! Boring! You should read Three!! It's a great book! I don't like house. Slowww!! And Grosss!!! Dumb ending.
3,"Not their best product, not even close","I have read both these authors separately. They are better off that way.It was suspenseful but I didn't really care what happened to the characters because I wasn't given enough information to really like them or connect with them.It was horrifying but in a very shallow way. The Christian-based aspect of the story wasn't well developed.It's just a creepy, suspenseful book about people that aren't likeable. It you like that sort of thing, you'd like this book.If you have want to read a better book, try This Present Darkness, Prophet, Visitation..."
1,Horrible book!,I love Dekker's Circle trilogy and many of his early works. And I've heard Peretti is an amazing author. I was really excited for this book but it was a huge disappointment. I was hoping it would be scary or at least have a good Christian message or something but NOTHING! Don't waste your time or money!
1,Too Dark for me,"I have to agree with some of the other reviewers that this book is just too much... too dark, too violent. I absolutely love most of Frank Peretti's books. This Present Darkness was a life changing read for me, I loved how it helped me visualize the spiritual world.But House is just too reminiscent of today's horror movies. I understand the appeal for a lot of people who like that kind of violence but I have no desire to see it. I have read Ted Dekker's Black, Red and White series and I enjoyed those books but others of his, The Martyrs Song series, again are just too violent. I can understand how the 2 authors together would produce this kind of book. Again just not at all to my taste."
5,Now THIS is a THRILLER!,"HOUSE is a beautiful blend of the styles and voices of Frank Peretti and Ted Dekker. Even without knowing who'd written it, I believe readers could guess.The novel is the fastest pace book I've read. I have something to point to and say, ""Now, THAT's a thriller."" As someone who writes in this genre, I will reread this book to study their craft.The book is exciting, well written and a wonderful allegory. I can't wait to see this on the big screen. I hope the movie maker will do it justice.Though these authors say they found collaborating difficult, I'd love to see more of the two of them together.Absolutely wonderful!Recent interviews with Peretti (end of this month) and Dekker can be found on my fiction blog, Novel Journey.www.noveljourney.blogspot.com"
1,Awful!,I had read good things about Ted Dekker and decided to read one of his books. I won't make that mistake again. This is writing? This is one of the worst books I've ever half way read (I couldn't finish it). Don't waste your time.
2,Hated it.,"I hated 'House'. Probably well written, but hated the subject. Why did I read it when there are happier books out there?"
5,Surprisingly simple and effective method,"Yes, it is true. With this book you will learn to read and write Korean. It breaks down the language structure in a very logical and easy to understand way. It is also filled with useful phrases and other bits of information. I highly recommend this book (along with a good Korean-English dictionary) to anybody travelling on the Korean peninsula."
4,"Will make many ""best of"" lists","On ""Nuclear Daydream (Dig),"" Joseph Arthur unclutters his sound and relies more on arrangements and simple acoustic guitar. The results are a leaner sound, one that has more space and fewer layers---not that one should expect anything sparse! (I felt that at times his creative instincts were overwhelming, even distracting, on his previous release ""Our Shadows Will Remain."") These songs, which are tales about troubled lives, troubled relationships, finding love, and soul searching may not mine any new territory, but they have a lilting energy that recalls Nick Drake in his rare up moments.Mr. Arthur's distinct singing voice and shimmering guitar dominate this recording (I'm so glad he has not made an acoustic album), and his knack for layering choruses and plying emotion from a multitude of instruments and effects shine throughout ""Nuclear Daydream (Dig)."" I suspect this CD will make many ""best of"" lists in the coming year."
4,Reflections on the Art of Living...,A good summary of the things everyone should know. Enough said. You'll enjoy the summary of guidelines for happier and better living.
4,Thought provoking intelligence...,This was my first Joseph Campbell book and it has inspired me to read his other works. Amazing thoughts on so many things. I believe the man was true genius...
2,Miss,"If you are looking for a book on Joseph Campbell, think again. Instead you will receive a hodge podge of Diane Osbon's thoughts and her own perspective of life- disapointing."
2,A rewrite of the dullest moments of the Rama series.,"I adored the Rama books and thought Gentry's first solo book Bright Messengers was promising although unfulfilling. I hoped Double Full Moon Night would elaborate and inject some badly needed ideas but left the book very disapointed. Gentry develops his characters very well and then does nothing interesting with them. All they seem to do is wander around, not knowing anything, and finding out precious little more of any interest. There is a never ending description of their environment but I find it similar to road movie where you never see outside the car. At least now its clear who contributed what to the Rama series. Arthur is a visionary, ideas filling every page whereas Gentry is a competent character developer with no imagination at all."
4,Enjoyable,"I found this book very entertaining. Perhaps it is Gentry's writing style, I don't know, but it was hard for me to put the book down. True, there are probably too many sentient creatures running around with no explanation of their origins. I read the the last Clarke-Lee Rama novel 7 years ago so I can't nitpick any of the details. Overall though, I enjoyed returning to the Rama universe in this book and Bright Messengers, thanks Gentry."
1,Why oh why?,"I started to read this book with trepidation as I did not care for the ""Sister Beatrice The Perfect"" in Gentry Lee's FIRST take off from the RAMA series. What did I think? Well, I did read it fast and it was a page turner. Gentry Lee does do a fine job with description and leading the reader along. The problem? The plot. All I could think was when I got to the last couple of chapters was--did Gentry Lee write the last episode of Bob Newhart's last show? Yup, he tied up lots of loose ends and I'm glad that there aren't any left so he can write any more books on THIS storyline. The plot was just insipid."
2,Very little improvement. Not worth it.,I installed these horns on my new 2012 Kia Optima and I found very little difference. I recorded before and after video with sound. The amplitude is the same and the tone is just a shade lower in pitch. It certainly was NOT worth the cost and effort!
5,Nice Sound,"I have a work truck that came with one horn that has one awful tone. I purchased these to upgrade the sound and to gain volume. This set accomplished both.The sound is a much richer quality, they were easy to install and after months of use they continue to perform quite well. I just purchased my second set of these for another truck that I acquired."
1,Errors up the Yin Yang!,"Errors in both text and involved mathematics make this book a horrible waste of my money. I see this as, ""lets fix one error on each edition, and continue selling the heck out of it to university students."" Well, at least West Virginia University will no longer use this one."
1,PRODUCT DID NOTHING!,I have done cleanses in the past with phenominal results so was anxious to do the liver cleanse. I just completed the 30 days and the only thing it did was make me very constipated during the entire 30 days. I even upped my phyllium intake. I got so constipated that I got a hemmeroid...yuk. Very disappointed and am glad I am finally done.
1,"Not a great ""Toots"" album.","I can't believe Toots Thielmans would put his name on this album.I seems like a compulation of a bunch of old stuff that was laying around.It almost sounds like he dubbed a few bars onto an old arrangement.He is a great talent,but not on this album."
4,Compliance and Conviction,"As Dr. Nadler suggests, Inside the Boardroom does contribute substantially to the subject of corporate governance. It is a very important study that focuses primarily on the private sector. The book is very well prepared. However, if you want to peer inside the boardroom and gain a perspective of another active leader in corporate governance in the public sector, I strongly suggest that you read Compliance and Conviction: The Evolution of Enlightened Corporate Governance by Curtis J. Crawford, Ph.D. In his book, Dr. Crawford discusses why and who should care about corporate governance. Further, he provides a historical perspective on the topic. This book focuses on succession planning, chief executive officer (CEO) supervision, executive compensation, and director independence. It is a great read."
4,It's ok,"The case is fine, not a lot of room for a whole lot else besides the psp and a small set of earbuds, but it does what it needs to do. Havn't really tried the car charger yet. Took me a little while to get used to the plastic shield, before i used to just take it off when i was playing. Now i've replaced the analog stick with one that comes in this package (much better analog stick), but i can't take the cover on and off without removing the new stick. So i've gotten used to it and it's really not all that bad. Only 4 stars because of the stick/shield issue."
3,Interesting but with limited information,It's a nice book if all you want or need is a basic reference about gemstones. It doesn't go into the properties to assist with purchasing. Nice photos and compact.
2,DISSAPPOINTING,"As one reviewer said this is a collection of Plasket's games, lightly annotated and grouped into general themes (attacking castled kings, pushing rook pawns, etc). There did not seem to be any deeper organization, no lessons, no laws, rules or guidelines. VERY DISSAPPOINTING!!But it's nice Mr Plasket got to make a buck off a collection of his games. If he just published a collection of his games, interest would be tepid at best (even though he is a nice attacking player!)."
1,EXPIRED Card -- Don't order Top-Up card here!,"While I love the Virgin Mobile service and the freedom of not having a contract, you should do your Top-Up through their website virginmobileusa.com instead of buying a card from a retailer. The card I received from Amazon is expired by six months! (As of this writing you can also get a fantastic deal on clearance phones at the Virgin site.)When considering the cost of call time, which may seem high, keep in mind you are also paying for all associated taxes, caller ID service and voice mail! Makes it quite reasonable to pay 25 cents/minute for your first 10 minutes of the day and just 10 cents/minute thereafter. And there are no additional charges.Bottom line: get the service, but don't buy the Top-Up card at Amazon."
2,"Do more research before you write a book, Bryan Geon.","It seems as if the author did not always have good first-hand source to write this book and wrote this guide from generalizations about other countries. For example, a supermarket in Japan carries almost anything you would find in a supermarket here. Convenience stores like Seven-Eleven are even more convenient than you think for the variety of prepared food available. Oh, there are a lot of decent bakeries too, which Mr. Geon fails to mention.Even though I can't really tell how useful this book is because I have never been to many foreign countries, I can tell you at least some of the information in this book is misleading."
2,not impressed....,I am a big buyer of DVD's for my children. I simply was not impressed with this one.
4,The Arbiter Chronicles An Excellent Audio Drama,This is so remminiscant of the old BBC Red Dwarf productions or the Star Wars Dramas that were broadcasted back in the day. There are alot of sterotypical science fiction personalities. But it still is one incredible ride.I wanted this to be horrible I really did. When I first saw that they had been performing this at conventions I wanted to be afraid and in fact was a little aprehensive. So while at one in Baltimore I heard them.I Live or in the CD format they are entertaining. My only real complaint is that it is short. Each episode is about an hour. Thats what gives it a 4 out of 5 stars.
2,nothing intimate about it,"There were no ""couple-yoga-moves"" or any yoga moves not found in a basic yoga for dummies book. The two in the video were wearing thongs, but otherwise there was nothing intimate about the video, including any interaction... it's two skinny white people stretching next to each other."
5,By Far the Best Part of the Series,"Like most triologies, the biggest character twists and best action sequences occur in Part II of Knightsend. The transition of John Paul Valley into the mantle of the Bat goes through a logical and compelling progression. Batman #500, the final volume in this book, was on of the first Batman comics I read when I was a child. I still have it, and it is still one of the best single-issue ""Batman"" comics I've ever read.As a bonus, if you don't hate Joel Shumacher's ""Batman & Robin"" enough already, when you see how much he perverted the character of Bane, one of the Bat's most formidible opponents, you'll you'll be foaming at the mouth."
4,picture cards,Good quality cards in a nice strong storage tin. good for language development. Some of the pictures are a little old fashioned. Otherwise does the job !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,Nice reading - short on pictures,"Book has lots of info, unfortunately I got it for a youngster who needed something with more pictures. Still a good book. I will keep it and get him another."
2,not easy listening,Heard an XL group in Sirius radio and wanted their music. It was definitely not these guys.
2,Poor design of the spout lid and handle,"When the tea kettle package was opened, the spout lid was broken. Upon investigation, it appears that the spout and he handle can interfere with each other. If the spout lid is open and the handle is lifted into it up roght position the handle coule snap the plastic spout lid. I suspect that is what happenned with the one I ordered.On the plus side, Amazon was great and handling the return."
2,Is the price correct?,Is this cake mix REALLY $32.28?or $3.28?I dont think any cake mix is so great that people would want to buy it for $32 + shipping.WOW.
1,Edited version of a classic Board Book,"All of the 1990's re-releases of Mercer Mayer's Little Critter Board Book Series (featuring Little Critter with various jobs) were reduced by a few pages. This means missing artwork compared to the originals. Because this version is missing pages of art and story, I am giving it 1 star."
3,"Lots of stuff, but oriented toward scripting","The claim that this is a ""practical guide to Linux commands . . ."" is an overstatement. The coverage of commands is relatively minimal. This volume doesn't really get into any depth or go beyond basic commands. The Command Reference (Part V of the book) is incomplete. It definitely is not a guide to using Linux.Several editors and a bit of programming are covered , though again the coverage is cursory.Overall, this is probably an okay reference for experienced Linux users. For people like me who don't use Linux often or in-depth, it is frankly not of very much use.Jerry"
4,Linux at its worst is not easy for 80 year old but it beats all others,"I built my first computer and went thru all the Apple line up to the Mac SE and was forced into Microsoft morass and now feel I must graduate into sanity and Linux seems to be the best avenue and I hope this is the book that will help me make the jump, it does look promising."
5,fine reference book,"Linux didn't last for long on my laptop until I installed the latestUbuntu 10.10, 4-Disks DVD Installation and Reference Set, Ed.2011. My previous ventures into Linux ended with much of frustration. My Ubuntu set comes equipped with bunch of PDF books included already, but I wished for a real paperback volume. I found this one (along with few other) used, in ""like new"" condition for very fair price. I can't call myself an experinced Linux user, but I'm familiar with a command line and know few simple commands. What I'm trying to say, that if you know already how to use command ""man"", you probably need no book. If your never heard of words ""man"" or ""terminal"" before this book will be almost unreadable. This is for people who work with Linux professionally, ""guru"" stuff."
3,"Handle OK, but useless.","The Mixet temperature control handle seemed to be an exact match for the old one. Unfortunately, the Mixet replacement valves aren't. Which makes the handle irrelevant."
4,Don't be fool by the brand,"This is a fantastic product. It is very competitive in term of pricing, quality and features. There is no USB cable come along in a package. No big deal since you can share the cable with other devices like your external harddrive or MP3 player. The picture quality is good. Focusing time is good. Easy to use menu eventhough no touch screen function, again no big deal for me. In summary, you can't find the camcoder at this price with the quality competible with SONY SR82."
5,Classic Bad Company,"Quite simply - this concert captures the absolute essence of Bad Company. Well filmed and recorded (ie: Modern techniques, no Vintage bodgy footage), this DVD will not disappoint.No matter Burrell and Ralphs are absent - inconsequential.I enjoyed every song on this DVD and will no doubt watch it again and again. I had to order 2 further copies for the guys in my own band we were all so impressed.Only an absolute die hard Bad Company fan would not be entertained."
3,Their is one better,This is a average Dvd but a stellar preformance is on Paul Rodgers alone in Glasgow!!!
1,Worst DVD ever!!!! Save your money and just get the CD,"This DVD is a complete let down. Don't buy this version. The audience was welcomed to join in for every single song which ruined the music video. I am not just talking a few words of the chorus either.....the ENTIRE chorus. I am all for audience involvement, but this was just overboard. I wasn't looking for a ""karaoke"" or a ""sing-along"" version, but if you are then this is for you. The audience over involvement was not the only issue with this DVD. Paul Rodgers' vocals were horrible as well. His voice sounded very strained and he clearly could not hit the high notes during the taping."
3,Could be better!,">The concert footage is great and Rdgers always delivers, but I was disappointed by the sound! I know it was recorded live in 2002...but I tried both DTS 5.1 and Dolby 5.1 and I found the sound thin without the ""punch"" I'm used to with good recordings. I just listened to Cream Live at Albert Hall....and the sound there was amazing!. then I put on Bad Company....and it really sounded flat in comparison....just my opinion!"
2,Dismissed as... coincidence. If even that.,"Too rambling and hippy-dippy, and the stories are pretty lackluster. Some were mildly psychic experiences as opposed to synchronicities, and most were just things that happened that the subject decided to read meaning into. The contributions seem to be navel-gazing accounts from the new-agey author's extended circle of friends. The book comes off as dated and not relatable to those who are not latter-day hippies. It's like when a friend tries to tell you about a cool dream he had, not realizing it's not interesting to anyone else.Another reviewer mentioned that ""Coincidence or Destiny"" by the same author is in fact the same book retitled and repackaged. It bears repeating as Amazon is currently suggesting you by both together."
1,On our fourth one....,"We have the Garmin StreetPilot and LOVE it, but the cable itself is a horrible design! We are now on our 4th cable!! Luckily we've been able to get 2 of them for free from Garmin with our receipt (1 yr warranty). Each time it seems the contacts don't connect as they should be and we have to wiggle it in the cigarette lighter until they connect. Eventually wiggling doesn't work and it just wont turn on. Then on to yet another cable..."
3,Why is this in with New Orleans Radiators ?,Why is this CD being advertised with the New Orleans Radiators?That doesn't make any sense as anyone can tell these guys are from the U.K. !Not Cajun ANYTHING !
3,Like 'Reality Check' taken to the next level.,"Here we have a compilation of the best of Seagz unreleased material recorded prior to his assassination. Before that he had released 2 other LP's, The Dark Roads in 92 and Reality Check in 94. TDR stands alone as a masterpiece of hard but intelligent gangsta realism. Personally I think most of RC's lyrics are in the right place but the production went from the raw kult thuggish vibe of TDR to that laid-back west coast style diminishing much of the impact it could have had. The result of Souls On Ice resembles RC kicked up a few notches, a little more hardcore, a much more solid album. 'Gotta Stay Down' is one of my personal faves. As usual Seag is amazing!"
4,Very Good,"While Bleeding Throughs Portrait Of A Godess doesnt add much new to the table, it is still a very good album. I would definetely recommend this instead of This Is Love This Is Murderous. TILTIM is a pretty generic and boring album. True, Bleeding Through are your typical metalcore band, but they play their music with more passion, fury, aggression and energy than most of them out there. The musicianship is pretty good, especially the drumming. The keyboards in this CD are also pretty interesting. The keyboardist Marta doesnt play anything hard or complicated, but she does add a different element to the music. The highlight tracks here are ""Rise"" and ""Portrait Of A Goddess"", two of the most aggressive metalcore songs that youll ever hear. Recommended"
3,"Great artist, but this album...","...is my least favorite of hers to date. While some people appreciate the less-polished, more upfront character of this recording, I find it very disappointing because she is in such poor voice (for her) on this session. I agree with many others that Fordham's voice is a marvelous gift; but on these recordings she lacks much of silky depth - as well as accuracy - of her previous efforts. It sounds to me like not just a matter of studio production, but that her singing is simply not up to her usual heart-stopping standards. I'll stick with ""Swept"" and ""Porcelain"" for now - two recordings I treasure."
2,Pearl Quinoa,I assumed that it was cleaned prior to packing. But that was not the case. I found small traces of mud/clay in the same and the wash did not get rid of them.I paid a lot but not happy.
3,so far so good...but too expensive for what you get,So far this soap has been pretty good. I smeel very nice but it tends to dry out my skin.I bought this soap thinking that I was getting a good deal...If you live near a target or walmart I suggest just buying it there. I just visited my local target and saw that they were selling 12 bars for 3 bucks...
1,junk,I thought it came with eggs. You have to add crickets. Just seemed to be a waste of money. I put crickets in it and did as it suggested. Nothing happened.
2,It's like a copy,"I buy a soundtrack because I like 2 or 3 songs in the movie, but this one, was awfull. Was like I was seated in the theater seeing the movie again"
4,the diva song,"The Diva song on the album rocks. the other songs are more or less theme songs, but ok."
2,Item way too small,"While it is a very nice item, the size information that V&B provides is way off - it is only 47cm x 33cm x 3cm, no matter how you measure it, it does not get to the size the claim. The volume is only half. The same item was ordered in Germany from V&B directly - same result. So, it's not that Amazon is doing something wrong, but the people at V&B need to be sent back to school to learn how to measure. This is very disappointing. (While I am not an expert on dinnerware measurements, I do teach Physics at the University, and this would not qualify for a passing grade.)"
2,"Great picture, poor quality","I love putting puzzles together with my son, and we were excited to go from the 100 piece puzzles to the 200 level. It's unfortunate, however, when the challenge of the puzzle arise more from poor construction rather than the actual difficulty of piecing it together.We always purchased Melissa and Doug floor puzzles in the past, but this regular sized jigsaw puzzle is a disappointment. I really had to force the pieces, which made it difficult to determine whether they really belonged together. Many pieces were bent, and the puzzle did not want to lay flat on the table. Pulling it apart was no simple matter either. All in all, I'm sure we'll work on it a bunch of times because of the great train picture, but I doubt it will last long since we have to pry the pieces apart so much and I don't think I'll be sad to see it go."
2,"I was hopeful, as I love Johnette but.....","I love Johnette and own everything she's done, except Los Illegals, which was a flop. So the sounds and the recording are fine, being mixed by Concrete's guitarist James Mankey. The content of the lyrics are the sticking point for me. Almost all of the lines seem contrite and hackneyed. The vocal delivery is sometimes not believable either. I really tried to like this, and gave it many, many listens from front to back. I am sad.....But I always have Mexican Moon to fall back on."
2,Too small,"I've been using a Microsoft Optical 5 button mouse for 11 years. I left it at a friends and needed a mouse tonight. I stopped by the local computer store and picked up the cheapest on the rack, this one.Never mind that it's only 3 buttons. My problem is that it's too small. I was told it was a full-sized mouse. Either it's not or my mouse is over-sized.I'm eager for tomorrow, where I will get my mouse back and tell my friend he can just have this one. I won't use it again."
5,"IT WORKS,","Had a problem with the old unit and figured I would replace it, ordered this unit, and put it on, and have not had a problem with this sensor."
5,the best janet CD ever,"this is janet's best, most personal, creative and innovative album, I never skip a song when listening to this CD. It's aged really nicely and is a timeless classic."
2,Velvety Smooth,"After the success of the ""Janet."" album Janet Jackson runs with its formula of dark grooves and sexually explicit songs. This time however she goes too far into her own world and fails to connect with the listener. To be sure there is some fun and interesting music here (Velvet Rope, I Get Lonely) but none of it is as captivating as her previous efforts. Somehow it all comes off as self involved and distant. Gone is the chipper Janet of ""Escapade"". Gone is the funky Janet of ""Control"". Instead we have an angry, depressed and almost pornographic woman who seems to think that she is the sexiest person alive. My how you've changed ""Miss Jackson""."
4,One Of her Best Albums!,Janet Jackson really expresses her true feelings in this excellent album. I own all of Janet's Cd's and a couple of her videos. She is a very talented female artist and great performer. This is her second best album she has ever put out in my opinion. This is an album you will never get tired of and you can just let the cd play. I recommend this Cd to EVERYONE!
5,Tied Up In The Velvet Rope...,"This is Janet's second album for the Virgin label, and it's a solid artistic work. Acceptance and rememberance are themes common on many of the tracks, with 6 singles and/or videos released from the album - ""Got 'Til It's Gone"", ""Together Again"", ""I Get Lonely"", ""Go Deep"", ""Every Time"", and ""You."" Even album tracks are VERY strong, something the follow up album really couldn't say. Noteably strong cuts include ""What About"", a rough, rocky slap in the face of an abusive man, and the sexuality accepting ""Free Xone"". If you had to choose between this and the most recent Janet, go for the ""Rope""."
3,"It's okay, but nothing spectacular.","I agree with the person below who said that she needs to get rid of Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis. They did some great work on janet., 1814, and even Control, but their work here seems tired and stale. When 18145 and janet. came out, I had never heard anything like them before, but when The Velvet Rope came out, it all sounded like every other female R&B singer who has come out recently. Janet has talent, but she should definitely find some new producers. Jam and Lewis just don't have what it takes any more.There are some good songs on The Velvet Rope, but the majority are just okay, and easily forgetable. I'm hoping she ditches Jam and Lewis for her next album, and finds someone else (I just hope it's not Puff Daddy)."
5,I can listen to this album all the way through,it is janet's best album of her career and one I can listen to without skipping any tracks like I find myself doing with recent janet albums. This album was a hit worldwide selling 7 million copies and accompanied by a hit dance record and smash world tour.
3,It's okay.... continued,"I forgot to add that she has got to get rid of those stupidinterludes. They were cute on 1814, a little old on janet., and they absulutely suck on The Velvet Rope. What's with the over-the-phone masterbation one anyway. It's just tacky and tasteless, and I have to agree, Madonna did this way back with Erotica. It sucked when she did it, and it sucks when Janet does it."
3,Entertaining albeit some tasteless pitfalls,"High quality production delivered with high energy albeit tasteless at times with stage dancers pulling their pants down on stage to display their ""package"" in briefs, backup singers bumping talent from behind in sexual innuendos, and a call to several males in the audience that comes too close to a lap dance for my taste. I'm all for sexuality, but this performance crossed the line on several occassions. Recommended to DC fans for its presentation, superb lighting, and strong stage performances. VQ and AQ are excellent with deep blacks, beautifully saturated color, and well balanced sound. For a classy presentation watch Shakira's Oral Fixation, or Beyonce - The Beyonce Experience concert."
3,Not 2 shabby 4 the price!,"If you are a Destiny's Child fan or know someone who is they will surely enjoy this disc. Some may say you don't need the Blu-ray version just the regular DVD and a player that does the upconversion, but who am I to argue? It's simply a matter of opinion!"
1,Cheap!,"As other reviewers have pointed out, these are made of cheap plastic and the title is misleading. Cost about .01 to produce, or less. Nice profit margin! Should have read the reviews before I bought them. This may be the only bad purchasing experience I've had on Amazon out of hundreds."
3,A bit disappointed,"I was a bit disappointed that the jar was made of plastic. Also, the battery doesn't last very long. So if the battery is out before you fill the jar up, you loose the count."
4,All Of The Melrose Place Season Are Great And The Final Season Gives The Show A Good Ending.,Most Shows Toward The End Run Out Of Good Stories But Melrose Place Never Missed A Beat. Always Lots Of Surprises.
5,YES YES YES,"See my review on vol.1. Only thing is that i read the last song played was ""closing time"" by semisonic. That is not the case with this. But I loved the series nonetheless. Get it!!"
2,"Dont buy if you live in AZ, HI","Whoever wrote the firmware for this unit needs a wakeup call! The automatic setting DST is great if you live in an area that observes it, but you can't turn it off! What an oversight! Otherwise, it would have been a great product with few equals."
3,Lousy CD,"I wanted a CD/Cassette player for my Chevy truck. Yup, you know if you're a GM or Chrysler owner, there's not much out there in 1.5 DIN and who wants a 1.0 DIN with faceplate surround?First major complaint: the CD skips like crazy from the slightest bump, even on slightly rough freeways.Second complaint: too bright, can't turn down the lights on the face at night and it is very distracting.What's happened to Jensen? They used to make a good product.I'm looking for a replacement but so far nothing's out there."
3,Diane,This is not exactly what I thought it to be but gives great ways to loose weight and it is based on the Bible.
4,I loved weigh down but now 3 months later I am lost,"I read weigh down this summer and lost 15 pounds and felt great. I now am starting to gain weight again. I was 10pounds from goal, when I stopped. Help Gwen what now. dj in midland"
5,Weig Down Diet,"I think diet distracts you from this book. It's a way of life. Our country and the diet machine has taught us to make the food behave. Take out all the fat or sugar out of it, instead of us the people, to get a hold of ourselves and stop pounding down the food...We just plain eat too much food. We even have good foods and bad foods. Buy the book and she will explain how we got away from listening to our stomachs and started using our heads...It really works."
5,This is a diet I can live with !!!,"A friend told me about this book. I think it's GREAT !! Finally, something that makes sense and will work !!"
1,WARNING,"Before you buy this book, join the Weigh Down Workshop, or in any other way financially support Gwen Shamlin's enterprise, I urge you to become aware that she is the leader of a cult called Remnant Fellowship. You can read an excellent article on the midwestoutreach.org website. Just search for Gwen Shamblin. Thank you and God bless!"
5,Madea's Big Happy Family,This was a feel good movie. It had a little bit of everything. It made me laugh and cry. I would like to have seen it end differently. I felt as though the ending was incomplete.
5,It's a must love movie...,"Reality check movie... some take people for granted then realize how life can change within seconds. Plenty laughs & quite a few tears/tissues moments. If you love someone tell them daily, don't wait until it's too late. TP is a genius!!!"
5,Madea Does It Again!,"If you're a fan of Madea, you won't be disappointed.This is a funny movie.I loved it.Movie came fast in the mail.I would definitely do business again with this seller."
3,different,Whenever I think of Madea I think comedy and though this movie had some comedy it also had drama and sadness. Still not sure how I feel about that. But I love Madea so I can only say it was good but different.
1,Dead out of the box,"Purchased this item as a possible x-mas gift. Did not work in the packaging, so I opened it up (thinking maybe it had one of those battery saving tags). Still did not work (no tabs). Let it sit in sunlight for a few hours, nothing. A few days, nothing. Finally it ran for about 30 seconds and died. It never worked again, even after leaving it in the sun for a week. Save your money. If you want to try one that works, I purchased a Rayovac solar key-chain light for about half the amount of money of this piece of garbage."
2,wrong item supplied,I orginally ordered a Model No. L4064B2210. When Amazon placed the order with Beanworthy Hardware it was for a Model No. L4064B228. The order was subsequentlysupplied by Grady's Hardware. I could not use the Model No. L4064B228 and returned it to Grady's Hardware per instructions. To date it has cost me $13.99 to return this item. As of this date I have not received any credit for the the item whichoriginally cost me $64.65.Advice to anyone purchasing from Amazon: check all model no. to be sure you will get what you want.
4,Awesome!,"Your probably wondering why I gave it four stars. Well, it is because once you get to 8% it automatically skips to 100%. I'd recommend you just click Go to[ ]... and put 80 and you will get to continue reading. I don't know maybe it will not do that to you but you should test it to see if it does that or not. Other than that it was good. By the way, this is a poem not a book and the author believes that hell is in betelgeuse."
1,The Love Boat this is NOT,"I work on cruise ships, and rest assured that this soundtrack contains a collection of songs that genuinely do encapsulate the environment for which they are intended: ie pure kitsch (except for the fact that I doubt very much if ANY cruise line could afford UB40, regardless of how the group is doing these days). The remix of Mark Mancina's original ""Speed"" theme is painful, and while we're talking about him, why has there been no sign of his score? I can only echo the sentiments of one of the other reviewers: that his rumbling, fast-paced compositions have, much to my own frustration, never appeared for public consumption..."
3,Not as Nice as Expected,"I bought this for my nephew wanting a nice Made in the USA toy. It was much smaller than it appeared online, for the price I was disappointed. It came in a cheap blister pack and although the toy is very nice and good quality for that much money I expected something much larger. The cars were only a few inches long each."
1,Run Away,"I wish I had seen these before I bought this for my daughter. It lasted about 2 weeks, I thought it had just drained the 8 AA batteries, but fresh batteries couldn't save it. Refurbisher warrantees their work for 30 days, but since I bought it for Christmas, it sat for that long before she even got to try it.If I could figure out how to give it 0 stars, I would.No, no, no."
3,shower with cd... amazon purchase,"no matter how wet it gets the tunes stay dry, no matter how dry the tunes the radio's all wet"
1,Enough!,"Status Quo was dredging the bottom of the covers barrel for a spell in the '90's and '00's. There was the ""Anniversary Waltz"", the ""Don't Stop"" LP and then this. The only original track on the CD is an Andy Bown composition that shares the LP title, which bookends the album. This is recommended only to Status Quo completists. No more covers, please."
3,Cant say much,"Since it doesn't seem to have the desired effect, at least, for me pr on me. I feel nothing. Therefor, I can't recommend it. It may work for others, however."
1,Not pleased at all,This will be the last time I order a book and there is not an image/review of book. My son has not picked up any techniques and threw the book to the side. Not at all pleased with this purchase
3,coldplay they are not,"Well, Somewhere Only We Know is a great single to start off and it gets better and better with every listen. It's definitely worthy being on your play list even if you are a fan of indie rock or notwhen you want to chill or mellow out.The other reviewer said that Keane sounded like Coldplay but they actually sound more like Scottish band Travis. Nevetherless, i still think Travis will always reign supreme having provided us with such great songs like Why does in always rain on me, Writing to reach you, Turn and Driftwood among others. Great effort by the boys of Keane though :)"
2,A disappointment...,"I knew Robert Rodriguez only from his appearances on the Comic Relief albums. Some of his stuff on those was great. This, his first solo album, did not live up to my expectations. Predictable and filled to the brim with ""black people never do this, hispanics always do that, gringos are like this"" and ""women are different from men because..."" and so on, this is to be avoided, unless you love comedy based almost exclusively on observations on racial and sexual sterotypes."
5,The Saga Continues . . .,"James Dashner is a fresh and original voice in the Young Adult market. Both my 14 year old daughter and my 12 year old son enjoyed his book, A Door in the Woods, and went right on the read the next book in the series. The telltale sign of an excellent book is when kids tell their friends about it and recommend it, both of which my children did. A Door in the Woods is a great start to introducing the series and we are looking forward to much more from Mr. Dashner. Be prepared for late nights if your kids start the book---they won't be able to put it down!"
2,Bad Remastering,"It's good to see all this material gathered together in one place and intelligently organized. Unfortunately, the producers chose to ""modernize"" the sound by using heavy dynamic compression and brightening the tonal balance. The result is a rather unpleasant sound. The Sundazed reissues sound much more natural and true to the originals. Frankly, for all their faults my 80s French bootleg LPs sound better than this. I could live happily without the new Aguilar vocals too. It's a shame Sundazed hasn't done a comprehensive Watchband collection. This truly sounds horrible."
5,Portal and Les Musiciens: Wonderfully done...,"Mozart's Clarinet Quintet is maybe his most famous chamber work, most probably the most recorded and performed one. It is great to see that the musicians performing here have done a wonderful job. Portal is a great artist who has the gift of making every musical phrase sound natural and complete. Les Musiciens in the Quintet are great, playing relaxed. Nothing in this recording is 'obsessed with energy and brilliance'. This kind of playing shows that nothing has to sound 'romantic' to be expressive.'Kegelstatt' Trio is also wonderful. Jean-Claude Pennetier is a great accompanist here. In both pieces the members sound as one. Both pieces are so maturely played that one doesn't feel any 'force' to make the music flow. Once again Portal fascinated me with this expressive and natural playing; he is definitely one of the greatest clarinetists of our time. Wonderfully done."
2,Pretty but leaks,I really love the look of this feeder...except it leaks quite a bit and attracts more ants than Hummingbirds
3,"Lovely to behold, frustrating to use","This is a beautiful work of art to hang in your garden. However, due to the hand-made irregulariy of the opening, the rubber stopper is extremely frustrating to keep in place; if it loosens, air goes into the feeder allowing all of your precious sugar water out. I used clear packing tape as a solution to keep the rubber stopper in place, and it's working perfectly."
4,Beautiful and Inspiring,"If possible, this book is even better than the other two in the series (IN THE PRESENCE OF THE LORD and PRAYING IN THE PRESENCE OF THE LORD). Fr. Groeschel has an opening chapter of advice on ""structuring"" a holy hour with the Blessed Sacrament, and it alone is worth the price of the book. Then follow the inspiring quotations from a variety of saints, blesseds, venerables and servants of God that run the gamut from profound to beautifully simple, long to short, mind-boggling to down-to-earth. A beautiful vade mecum for those times when we want to be ""alone with the Lord."""
4,Midnite Lover is' boombastic',"I enjoyed the more soulful lyrics in the ballads of this album. I listen to this cd every morning before I leave for work.My favorite tracks are ""Piece of my heart"" Sexy body girls"" ""Thank you Lord"" and the title track. I think this album was more mature and creative than ""Boombastic"". I am really sorry it wasn't promoted more because a lot of people are missing out on an excellent copilation."
3,A Good CD that didnt get enough intrest,"Shaggys CD midnite Lover is not one of Shaggys best works, But i did enjoy this cd alot. The song ""Peice of my heart"" is my favorite. Most of the songs are slower paced and have a deep meaning. (genie, dream, peice of my heart, thank you lord, ect.) Then there is the songs that are a little more... fast (midnite lover,Sexy Bodied girl)Ideffinitly prefer Boombastic and Hot Shot over Midnite lover. But this is still a great cd.This cd is between a 4 and a 3 to me"
2,good for adult reggae lovers,"After the huge success of Boombastic, I thought Shaggy would expand on that success. This album, to me, has a totally different sound than Boombastic. The best tracks on the album are probably John Doe, the Peice of My Heart remix, and I guess Tender Love is okay too. But even these sound way too popish. They sound like they were made for some adults. It's totally not dancehall but more like Pop/rock and lovers rock. Don't get me wrong, I love Shaggy, but I think this doesn't help his potential. If it wasn't for That Girl, which wasn't even his song, he'd be a one hit wonder in America. I think Shaggy sounds best when he's exploring more true dancehall and reggae, and he's at his best when he does hip-hop and r&b. This album was a disappointment and I'd only recommend it for adults over thirty five."
2,Low practical utility,"I am a family doctor, and bought the book as a reference for my practice. I have attempted to refer to it several times, and am sad to say it had NO USEFUL clinical information I could use.The book is good for someone who wants a broad overview of all alternative medicine, but is of low utility for any specific or detailed information.Bottom line: do NOT waste your money buying it."
4,A good set of nuts for....,"Model-Builders!!! I tell you that as I was coming to an end of a ship building project, an aircraft carrier, when I wanted to mount the ship. Well I went to a hardware store to look for a set of hex nuts that would screw to a new set of ""lamp"" risers (these are used to mount the model to a wooden base) when I spent 1.5 Hours looking for the right nut. To make a long story short, they were not regular hex nuts that most of us would use, and They were Not Metric neither!! So I find out later that they are 27 thread hex nuts, so even though it some un-necessary nuts, these were the only ones that I did not need in bulk, nor in expense!Look for 1/4-27 thread hex nuts!"
2,sizing no right!,"The sizing chart doesn't work. My 94 polaris xlt sp is 102"" long from bumper to bumper;so i got a medium (up to 110""). Not even close! Way too small! Beware. No I have to return it. What a hassle."
2,Good Debut!!,"This 1998 CD recording has lots of musical imagery and gives the listener a challenge. Many of the tracks take you on a soothing, Gaelic journey into the artist's soul. Without question, Sheryl is talented in many ways taking a big part of the recording duties. I was impressed with the instrumentals, as they had a hint of ""Enya"" and ""Clannad"" influences. There were a few problems with the CD. One was the quality of the recording. Most of the tracks stop with a lull before the next track starts. Also, I didn't much care for the vocals, although she did have a nice voice. In spite of those shortcomings, ""Past Echoes"" was still a unique experience to listen to. Very Original!!"
2,Not worth it even if you can't afford better,I had the Kodak P850 I loved the camera but I wanted more our of it and didn't want to spend the money at the time for a SLR.I bought these lens and they seemed like a good idea. However no matter what I set the aperture to I couldn't get the camera to focus the way I wanted it to. I could get the center to focus but it had a blurry tunnel to that point. If you tried to zoom out all the way you would then have the four black corners from the lens seeing the tube the lens are in.They could be used however if out of focus is what you are looking for or maybe for your art style. I have since sold that camera and bought a SLR.
1,icap,"Purchased icap recently, great concept, poor quality execution. The caps were so thin and flimsy, they wouldn't stay on the iphone earbuds. They won't stay in your ears, either. Don't waste your money."
5,Well made and sounds super,"This well-made wood block is beautiful to look at. It sends off a resonate and loud sound when struck with a mallet in the right spot ""Ouch, I gotta hit it easy so my ears don't hurt."" It has 4 rubber pieces stuck to the bottom and also has holes for mounting on a stand or drum. It does not come with a mallet."
2,Setting Up Recurves & Longbows & Shooting Instictively / Arrow Making featuring Paul Brunner,"Found this video interesting and informative. Thought it was a little limited and could have been expanded to cover the subjects more. Directed towards the hunting archer. I feel that this video will answer some questions, especially if you are a novice, and leave you wanting to know more."
3,"the drummer keeps drumming, the horn blower keeps blowing","after hearing public meditation on a boarder ceedee i got, i was expecting a wee bit more from tab two. as i put the ceedee in the box, i was satisfied through about three tracks. then i fell to sleep. i was determined to try again and make it all the way through, and i did improve by about two tracks or so. then i figured screw it and just listen to the bestest song public meditation. if you want a decent ceedee or one as a lullaby, buy it you will be satisfied. otherwise good luck making it through. P.S. the secret song is somewhat entertaning if you can understand it."
4,this is a must.,"I had the chance to see him live in Ecuador. It's amazing!. The records captured just the same energy. If you are into Brazillian folk, bossa, and jazz this is a must!!. The trio is well put together. The drums and bass are equally viruosos.Overall i think is the recording is fun, interesting, energized and full of musical surprises, This is a future classic, take my word for it.RP"
3,Good but not great,"I bought this to finish off my Krewe costume for Mardi Gras. I liked that it is not over-the-top with cliche pirate decorations.Based on the price and low quality of steel I was expecting a blunt sword for costume purposes, the sword has a very sharp point and the blade is moderately sharp. So it is less than ideal of a drunken costume ball.One of my main gripes is the description proffers a ""polished finish,"" however, the blade is anything but polished. It is a very dull steel even after using from Brasso.So,.. I'm not sure who their niche audience is, but costume party people be careful with the sharp pointy sword."
3,Good book bad author,While this book covers many very obscure subjects and the style is quite amusing and keeps you interested. It a shame that the author gives so little consideration to other's people work and time. A good book from a very selfish person.
1,One of the worst,"This film is exceedingly bad, even for the genre it represents. The same tired, formulaic plot about the good people who need to to make x amount of dollars from their business in a limited amount of time in order to save it from the clutches of the evil people. The photography and acting are horrendous; the sets look like the insides of your nearest strip mall. I was looking forward to seeing gorgeous babes in threadbare bikinis stripping and in various stages of undress. There is very little of that, unfortunately. What there is a lot of however is those ANNOYING male characters who's mere presence prods you to throw a brick through your TV set. One no talent dope is so excruciating to watch, that it's pure torture. Julie Strain has an all too brief sequence where she does a striptease, but the camera moves away abruptly as she finishes. Pathetic. I saw this late one night on HBO Plus at a cousin's house. Don't pay for this garbage on video. Avoid it at all costs."
3,"It's okay, but...","I'm not a music reviewer, so I'll keep this short. This LP is okay, but if you want to hear some better hush, you should check out his mixtape, ""full clip."" It's much, much better. You can't cop it thru amazon, but it is available..."
5,Another white rapper from the D but with rock instruments,This is one of the best albums of 2005 and of course his a friend of Eminem.There's not much to say about this album because it's almost perfect.Just buy it and you'll see.
4,Nothing like pictures...,"The best thing about this book is that it has actual photos of the locations. It's much easier to make a judgment based on this than just words or a hand drawing, as in some cases. The descriptions were pretty accurate as well."
5,Review of Tyldesley's 'Private Lives',"I understand why this book is no longer in print--it was attached to a television program. However, I'd like to argue that this work could flourish as a stand alone introduction to recent developments in archaeology. Tyldesley offers a mixture of basic history and recent developments in archaeology that work to reexamine traditional accounts. The movement through three different case studies is especially effective. It allows for a sense of focus on particular historical landscapes as Tyldesley introduces new information to modify these landscapes."
1,$114?,Not to put down on this product but the price has gone from last I checked $29.99-39.99 to $114 this is not guitar hero this does not have enough bells and whistles to be even remotely close to being priced so high. I am not one to write a review unless it truly deserves one but I feel the need to inform people of the dramatic price increase. There is no need for something that does so little to cost so much. In all reality anybody who has a PS3 has a remote charger (the PS3) this may look better than a hanging wire but I do not believe I should have to spend $114 on something that serves no purpose I cannot already do other than add a little spice to my system. I hope Amazon see's this blatant rip off and corrects it.
4,Needed Accessory,"I did not like that to charge my PS3 controllers I needed to leave my PS3 on and running, even when I wasn't using it. This accessory solved that problem and it did it well.It can charge up to 4 devices at once (2 using the brackets and 2 using the side USB ports). I currently use this device to charge myPS3 Controllersas well as my Darklite Bluetooth Headset EX-01.It is very simple to use. My only complaint is that sometimes I will plug in a controller and instead of the light turning red saying it is going to charge, it goes green saying it is fully charged even when I know it is not. All I do is unplug the power from the back of the charge station and then plug it back it or unplug the controller and replug that in. This seems to correct it and starts to charge the connected devices."
4,ps3 charge station,its a great product at a good price is easy to use and really help full you have your controllers on a safe place and it goes with the console look but its tricky to put on and remove the controllers
3,"Considering it's age, et, al, not a bad video treat for the 'Trick...","...and how about the 1977 pic of 'Trick with TPhaving acne! How about a newer and better pic?The set list is pretty good and Nielsn funny asall get out in the outakes, of the Australia 1streleased draft of this, which I got from mykaussie.com first."
2,Very dissapointed....,"This DVD release is from a lackluster performance by the band in Sydney, Australia, in 1988. To be fair, I don't know if it's the band's fault or production's fault... But something is wrong here... the band seems uninspired, the sound is not great at all (far, very far from it!). Also, the set list is short.The feeling you will have is that this is no this band's greatest performance by a large margin... and you will wonder why, if it was to release a live DVD, they decided for this cold concert..."
5,Exactly what I expected!,"I'm the type of consumer that likes to touch and feel before I buy. I was a little aprehensive about buying this item without having the opportunity to check it out. The price was a definite plus! I paid 35% less than the manufacturer on thier website. All I can say is that all of the reviews that I read prior to buying were right on the money! What do I love about it? I especially appreciate that it doesn't ""bulk up"" my PDA, it really does fit perfectly. It is fashionable looking. Comes with a nice belt clip option and tools to assemble if you choose to use it that way. Comes with a ""gift box"". What don't I love about it? ... The magnetic closure isn't quite as strong as I'd like it to be. It's a little ""loose"" feeling. (However, I did drop my PDA in this case this morning, the magnetic closure opened but the PDA stayed in place with no damage). All in all, I'd definitely purchase this item again, I love it!"
2,Limited life - cold weather?,I purchased a bulb on jan 23rd - it lasted until feb 15th. I've had varying success with these bulbs and I'm unsure if the weather has played a factor here in Ohio.
5,Lamp Maker,These are great kits . I have been useing them for over 20 yrs and they are complete with everything you need.
4,Make-A-Lamp Kit,This is a very complete and well put togther kit. It is easy to asemble and made my project look great.
4,luminous Sarah,"I've always had something of a crush on Sarah Polley; beautiful, smart, and her politics are alright. Not only is she sublime in this intelligent drama, but her singing and the music accompanying her here are hair-raisingly good. As if her work alone didn't warrant the purchase, the score by Danna is haunting and memorable. A perfect combination that really adds to the wintry ambience conveyed in the film."
1,Poor Quality!! DO NOT BUY!!,"When I attempted to adjust the straps for the dress, one of them ripped off.This is not the first time I have received a DreamGirl item as a gift.About a month ago I received a DreamGirl dress that had neon straps going down the back and the very first time I put it on, one of the straps going across the bottom came undone.**Extremely disappointed with the quality of DreamGirl items and will definitely be taking all their items off My gift lists.**"
3,disappointed,"Sure was disappointed in this CD. It's supposed to be on fire, but it wasn't even a simmer."
3,A visual treat but lacking in concrete information.,"This book looks fantastic-beautiful cover, lush full colour pics etc. but it really lets you down on the practicalities.For example, there is very little advice given on choosing the correct gown for different figure types. The photographs were also really dated and the sketches used by various bridal designers were pretty but totally unwearable.Having said that it's a great book for a student of fashion or someone interested in the historical basis of wedding gowns."
4,"Great Knob, cheaper price",This is a very nice looking knob from Schlage. It's easy to install and was the best price I could find.
3,Could have been better though !,"I have come to the conclusion after many listenings to this soundtrack that Vangelis 1492 film score is much better and more varied in content,(not so boring)! The soundtrack is much more powerful when used in the films poetic narrative. I even wish I would not have bought this soundtrack and bought Vangelis Spiral album. This Soundtrack is too monotonous to really keep me interested,Morricone should have used different themes instead of the same one over an over an over,lol..."
1,Go back to Hoboken!,"The singer's a poser! He went to a Slayer show wearing a Yo La Tengo shirt. That says a lot, don't it?"
4,Great Quick Read on the PCT,I really liked this book. It was a quick read that allowed me to get a good grasp for hiking the PCT. I liked Natasha's story. It gave a compelling tale about her walk.
5,PCT Hiker,This is a fantastic account of walking the PCT. I walked the trail in 2001 and this book really brought back all those special moments. I recommend it to anyone who is interested in long-distance hiking and trail-walking generally.
2,"I must have ""Myst"" something.","I just don't get the whole thing. Kind of boring if you ask me. I would have given it one star but it did come with a good free ""Chess Master"" game. Oh well!"
4,"""the name of the game is the same""","a famous quote(too bad i forgot the author), but the meaning hits home. a fancy-dancy box combined with a fancy-dancy name gives us the ""masterpiece"" edition. digitally remastered this, digitally remastered that(yada yada yada). after i saved the princess, the game was considered over (oops wrong game) but i think you can see the comparitive logic. this game is only recommended for somone that never played myst before, i mean, how many times can you solve a puzzle if you already know the solution ?? double check your computers system limits and options before loading the disc....as the myst series evolved, so did the hint books. thats a shame, a game shouldnt rely on ""hint books"". a game shouldnt have to be spoon fed to me."
2,Poor anatomy,"There's no way this is good anatomy, just get any Marvel or DC comic from your bookshelf and you will notice the huge difference. the bodies are just weird looking. Sorry."
5,Organic and Pure Vitamin E. Well worth the money!!!!!,"What a great product. This is the purest form of Vitamin E that I have found at my local health food store. It is very concentrated and thick. Vitamin E has antioxidant properties. Vitamin E is supposed to accelerate healing. So if you ever got a paper cut or a mild burn, some sources say that vitamin E may heal it faster. This product also works good as a moisturizer. This is another awesome product by Jason.Peace and Happiness,Patrick Leonardi"
1,Amazon Ships Wrong Product,Be careful ordering this product from Amazon. I ordered the correct part # and Amazon shipped the wrong part. Amazon would not return the product since it was past 30 days. Now I am stuck with mounts for a suburban instead of a camaro. Thanks Amazon...I hope you go out of business!
2,Where is Charlie Haden?,"This release should have been titled Michael Nyman: Gattaca Soundtrack, since that's all that it is. A collection of Nyman's tracks.And yes, they are very good, no doubt about it, but where is Charlie Haden and Stan Getz's exquisite ""First Song (for Ruth)"", the wonderfully emotional smoky jazz number from the scene on the dancing floor? And what happened to Django Reinhardt's ""Nuages"" ?If they included ALL THE ARTISTS' work on this cd, it would earn the right to be called ""a soundtrack"". Why did the producers emphasize only Nyman? Don't they want to make the best soundtrack compilation for us from the music pieces the movie provides? No, they don't. Including Nyman exclusively was a marketing decision, and not a move towards satisfying their listeners. For that - this cd gets one star. Since Nyman's work is so good, i'll give it two stars."
4,Haunting,I thought this was a terrific score from the beginning. The opening credits gave a sense that something very dramatic was going to happen. The music worked very well with the movie to provide it with a haunting and bittersweet feel. Gattaca is a very underrated sci-fi movie. It should have won the Oscar for Best Art Direction
5,Movement in Power and Sorrow,"The score stands alone creating its own powerful atmosphere. At first listening it feels as if it practices the same minimalistic feel as Phillip Glass, but the listener soon finds that the depths of the music does reveal movement. The music has the swooping melodies like John Berry but a stronger even more firm hold of the feelings expressed. The melodies circulate throughout the album and capture the listener in the sad and helpless feel, but with a scent of hope hidden inside. ""The Morrow,"" like many soundtracks, is the complete main theme and the listener is introduced to the other themes as the tracks continue. The album feels as if it is one long movement that carries the listener through. The most complete track is ""The Other Side,"" which is the climax of the film, because it has all the melodies thrughout the album set in this one piece; powerful and moving. The other tracks also have the full strong color of music."
1,Disappointment,"I purchased these VCDs off the steeleballs website after reading about them in HOW TO DATE YOUNG WOMAN FOR MEN OVER 35 - they are very dated most likely from the 80's they have no relevance on what Don says in his books just a cash grab, the amazing thing is Dons Website actual says there is a 15 minute piece on body language at the end rubbish - all there was his appearance on a TV show as a body language expert nothing wht so ever on body language itself."
3,Nice music but not as wonderful as I expected,This is my first album by this artist. I read all the reviews and thought that I would absolutely love the album. But it seems repetitious. Some of the lyrics bother me. The one song on this album that you can really love is Over the Rainbow. Very nicely done. I should have just bought that song as an Mp3.
1,Annoying!!!,"This is an OK book as far as a murder mystery, but the fact that the main character goes on and on and on again about being short made me want to pull my hair out and/or throw the book across the room! I am short too, and I can't ever remember a time when I considered it a hindrance, except maybe to reach something on a top shelf. And another thing...her many, many references to her being ""cute"" made me just want to hurl. I am not even halfway finished with the book, I have a pretty certain idea who did it, however I really could care less at this point and will have to force myself to even finish it."
4,A great mixture of examples and research,"This is one of the better textbooks I have read in a while. The authors provide many relevant examples to illustrate techniques and theory. In addition, there is a fair amount of research presented, lending support to their theories. The book is set up as an illustration of one type of therapeutic approach to couples and marital therapy. It is also fairly easy reading. However, there are topics not explicitely discussed in the textbook, so supplementary materials are helpful for a better understanding and use of the therapy approach."
2,May not work with your TV,"Good idea, but did not work with the television my kids use. The receptical is slightly recessed making it impossible for this adaptor to be fully inserted...therefore it didn't work...ended up returning it."
3,Julie Andrews: Live in Concert (import),Julie Andrews's performance is magnificent as expected but I rate this video three stars because of the quality of the video. I have a VHS of the same concert and the video quality is much better ...aren't DVDs supposed to be better than VHS? I guess not always. If I had known how bad this DVD is I wouldn't have bought it.I hope this concert comes out on Blu-Ray I would buy it on the spot.
1,BROKE BEFORE I COULD EVEN INSTALL,"This item seemed just what I wanted, until I went to install it. Had the wires attached and was putting that piece back into the sleeve, when the whole bottom part cracked and the pull chain came out of the slot and unit was useless. Might have been a bad one with a defect, but it was a waste of money and time. Do not recommend!"
4,"Javier Bardem is The Man: What a Contrast With the Psychopathic Killer in ""No Country for Old Men""!","It's worth $50 to purchase ""No Country for Old Men"" in Blu Ray and this movie just to watch the great acting lesson provided by Javier Bardem who is the youngest member of a family of actors (and it really shows!). The movie itself is much better than the negative reviews that are obsessed with its inferiority relative to the novel. There is much to be learned here about life and the aging process. The good news is sex after seventy is happening in grand style not to mention the dream fulfilled of getting a second chance to be with your high school sweetheart. The critics need to lighten up and get a grip on their (lost) sense of humor (assuming they ever had one)."
1,Bad Engrish!,"The Spanish/English is so bad I can't even concentrate on the acting. Unlike Salma Hayek's Frida, this one is horrible at blending the best of both worlds. Just read the book, it's WAY better."
5,Amazing!,I have seen this movie many times and even have the book. It is a very romantic/sad movie which shows how someone can love another so much that not even time could erase that person from your heart and mind. Great Movie!
3,"A tough story for a movie, B for the effort","I am pretty sure, if you read the book, movie is too insufficient to capture the wholesomeness of the book. The producer missed the point about the book that love is just an excuse for the book to be what it really is: a poem in prose; it's the words and the landscape it covers that make the book so enjoyable. Without that large human and environmental canvas, the movie seemed really barren. Three stars because the actor Javier Bardem acted superbly. Without him, the movie deserves 2 or 1 star. Sorry. If you read the book first, save your time."
2,What's the point of putting this out?,"I think that they rushed this out to capitalize on William Hung's first album and that bad audition he did on American Idol. I haven't seen it, but I don't think I will. They wanted to ride on that wave while he was still in the public eye. I think that exposing the bad auditions too much on Idol let someone else take them up. Hung's otherwise bad album and off key singing wasn't really necessary. But what's the point of putting this out so quick? They should have waited a year like they do with some other artists to let their (artist's) career develop. This get-it-out quick mentality in an Internet age is why music sales slipped the past 3 years or so. It looks so sloppily done and thrown together. If this was 10 years ago, Hung would have been forgotten, but the rules are different now. Terribly misconceived and misguiding!"
3,"Duped again by the word ""Soundtrack""","I agree with the above reviewer that i have also enjoyed all the Oceans sountracks to date and Ocean Thirteen is no exception. the problem is that the term soundtrack implies that the songs heard in the Trailer and Movie would be on the CD. This CD is/would better labled as ""The Score"" with a few extra songs by additional artists.Not nearly what i was expecting, but still enjoyable."
5,This is the sequel to ...The Harder They Fall!!!!!!,"In this video, Ranma has to get Happosai's battle aura out or the Hiryu Shoten Ha is useless. Ranma tries many different ways that fail but he finally comes up with a plan that succeeds and he brings out 120% of his anger. Kuno, Mousse, and Headmaster Kuno, and AKANE, all get caught up in the twister that comes when Ranma did the technique. Ranma has to get her down. He gets her and the pressure point chart rips into a lot of pieces. All Ranma classmates gather it up and give it to Colonge. One peice is missing: the one they need! Ranma disapears to go on a training journey. Ukyo starts hitting Happosai with her giant spatula. The missing peice is on Happosai's head and then .................. I'm sure you can guess!!"
1,One Of His Finest Albums Ever!,This guy is a real genius. No question about it. I'm going to name my kid Yanni. Yanni is the man. Yanni is the next Liberace. Yanni is as great as Kenny G. I will grow my hair in the Yanni style. Yanni forever.
3,Here It Is for Yanni fans,I have been a fan of Yanni's for years until I ran across Bradley Joseph's music (Yanni's former keyboardist). If you like Yanni you will LOVE Bradley as he writes beautiful melodies and takes music were Yanni left off. Check him out at http;//www.bradleyjoseph.com
2,Do They Still Make Jolt?,"Because if they don't, this is all you'll need. I've always considered Yanni's music calming yet somehow uplifting - music to take you to another world or place - to disappear into. This one makes me feel as if I'm in a Southern Baptist opera. Jolted me upright and bug eyed - not calming in the least. Not the Yanni as I enjoy in all the other CDs. I'm all for change, but I found this highly overrated and even more disappointing."
5,Worth the wait!,"Being a huge fan of Yanni's music, I had been anxiously awaiting the release of Tribute. It was well worth the wait. It's superb! I've had the opportunity to see Yanni in live concert twice. Most recently, in Dallas, Texas, I heard many of the new scores from this album. Believe me when I say, ""Tribute"" is the next best thing to being there!"
5,IT IS THE BEST MUSIC I HAVE EVER HEARED,Yanni is a genius. The song included in this album is trully inspiring and excellent. And this album is a platinum in the U.S.A. alone!!! Everybody will love his music both young and old. Yanni's music will touch your hearts and souls. Trully you would love his music. Every person on earth should have this album.
5,Nice modern classical music,"Nothing much, the tracks are pretty goo, with the exception of Love Is All. That is a GREAT one."
4,How can I say that this is his best?,"Yanni is a great composer, sexy musician and the best piano player I know.I heard people saying ""Music"" is ""Divine""...and his composition is one of the best examples for that.I don't know who Yanni was, until I watched his live concert at Taj Mahal on TV. I was very disappointed with myself, because I came to know about him so lately, and I missed his inspirational music all these days.After that I started listening to his other collections and believe me each and every composition is a gem.I gave four rating, because a person of his caliber will definitely make his next performance best than earlier one.And last but not least, hats off to his fellow performers and orchestral accompaniment, who are definitely adding a lot to his efforts.Eagerly waiting for his next opus."
2,Really wanted to like it,"I really wanted to like this book. I thought the premise sounded very interesting - the Secretary of State begins to mumble in Arabic after a head injury. I thought that this could go anywhere!Instead I found the story less and less believable. Generally, I am able to suspend my disbelief but this was not the case. I think it's because the story itself was a bit flat. I felt that the writing was a bit elementary, almost as if this was a draft and not a final piece of work. I wasn't turning the pages in suspense but in order to get through the book.I felt Cairo Conspiracy had a great idea but the idea was lost in the transfer to a book.I'm undecided as to whether or not I will try this author again."
4,"Galvanized Yes, ""Hot Dip"" No","Well there's not much to say, except that they're nails and they work accordingly with my DeWalt finish nailer. Unfortunately though, I bought 'em because they were described by Amazon as being galvanized in a ""hot dip"" process in which case they should work in ACQ lumber that I'm building a fence out of. However, I wasn't so sure so I called DeWalt and found out that they are electro-galvanized, meaning NOT suitable for ACQ. So other than the good value, which is why I am keeping 'em, I guess don't buy 'em for outdoor use and don't believe the Amazon description."
1,Should have been great,"The song selection on this one is great, but the sound is so bad it's barely listenable. Many of these songs can be heard to much better effect on other compilations. Don't waste your money."
1,Don't waste your money,"This book doesn't tell you anything about making money from growing food. The author's only statement about the $500,000 amount is found on page 219 in the ""Addendum for 2nd Printing"" which states ""Based on my experience, I still believe that it is possible to generate a gross income of $500,000 on one acre, IF it is done with great efficiency, steadily rollling full production, consistently hightest quality and totally reliable delivery."""
3,8525 Accessories,"Good idea to have a mini-docking station for the 8525. Pricing was reasonable and, it is useful when in the office to have the station rather than carry it around. Put the speaker on and you have hands free operation. However, two flaws I detected were; battery charging compartment is tight. You have to jam the battery to fit. Second, the camera button on the right side is activated when you slide the unit in and out of the cradle(unless you turn the phone off which defeats some the uses for the phone.) Overall, 6/10, above average."
1,Brunton macroscope,It is not what I expected. It is quite a bit heavier than I thought and is very difficult to hold still. I would return it if that is possible.
4,"The ""earth"" needs a ""hero"" like this","Chinese music lovers need this CD. Yet, even those who don't understand Chinese will fall in love with Leehom's amazing voice. You don't need to know Chinese to love this CD."
1,Do Not Buy This Product,"Although Amazon was very good in sending out a replacement for the first one which was defective, the second unit is defective as well. Also, both units were actually dirty and showed poor workmanship. Either I got two from a bad batch or this company has poor quality control.Again, Amazon was good but the product as the kids say 'sucks'."
2,Perhaps you would be happier with an upgrade?,"While this appears to be well made, It won't hold a chisel securely without using pliers to tighten the guide. This makes it very difficult to set the angle correctly.Once the angle has been set, this functions fairly well with minimal wobble from side to side.My advice is to upgrade to a guide that has an indicator for setting the angle."
2,Plane blades OK,"Worked great for my plane blades, but doesn't hold my chisels very well. And won't work for butt chisels at all. Went and got the Veritas honing guide. More expensive, but worth the money."
5,good sharpening guide,I use this guide to sharpen chisels and plane blades. It allows me to use the same angle every time. You need one of these if you are learning to sharpen.
3,semi-useful tool,"The Robert Larson Honing Guide is a simply designed device that works reasonably well for honing chisels and plane irons. The guide holds most blades securely and moves easily over the sharpening stone. The guide works well for chisels with 3-4 inch long blades and widths from 2 inches down to 1/4 inch. Its shortcoming is with blades shorter than 3 inches or narrower than 1/4 inch. The slots in the guide do not hold these smaller blades squarely and honing becomes difficult or impossible. Beefier tools (like mortising chisels) also do not fit well. For the money, a semi-useful tool to have on hand, but for a little more money, better honing guides are available."
2,After 18months...kaput,"I normally hold the KitchenAid in high regard, and had registered for this blender for my wedding.When we got it, I was so excited - the red was gorgeous and matched my KitchenAid Artisan Mixer (which I love.)We've had it now for 18months, and the blade has broken in half today. We used it on and off, but recently have used it daily for about 2 months to make morning smoothies.If you use it to make more than 6 smoothies back to back, the base will heat up. So I normally can't make too many at any one time.The blades also tend to get stuck and the motor heats up. So when making smoothies, I have to go through every speed before I can go to liquefy. Otherwise, the food doesn't get well blended.I was hoping that the blender would last longer than it has - especially for the price.I may buy a new blade, but haven't found great reviews for that either.Pretty disappointed."
5,got this blender about 1-2 weeks ago,"works very well!i think one of my favorite things about it is how easy it is to clean!all you do (and i didn't just come up with this cuz im lazy...the manual actually tells u to do this...) is rinse out the Jar then fill it halfway with water and put a couple drops of dishsoap in it, put the lid on and put it on ""stir"" for a ccouple sec. rinse out again tell all the soap is gone, tadaaaah - all clean! :)or you could also put he jar (without the blade) and the lid on the top reack of your dishwasher.only negative thing is that it smells alittle funny sometimes...i'm still hoping that that might go away after a couple more uses..."
1,Please Be Warned about all KSB560 Blenders,"I have had this blender for a little of 1 year. While the blender does a good job of blending, the product doesn't last as stated. First, Kitchen Aid claims this jar won't scratch or crack. That is incorrect as my jar shows many scratches from limited (3x a week) use. Also, there is an defect with the jar and blade assembly. The nut that holds the blade located on the underside of the jar begins to come lose which allows everything inside the pitcher to begin to leak onto the motor housing unit. Despite tightening, the nut continues to come lose and continues to leak when the blender is used. Customer service has been very unhelpful in resolving the issue. I would STAY AWAY from this Kitchen Aid blender and spend your $100 on a better product."
2,Returned item after using it three times,The blender broke after making three smoothies. I ended up getting the Oster Classic Beehive Blender and could not be happier
5,blender review,"High quality blender at a Great Price. Well made(quality parts). The 5-speed motor is well worth it, rather have more power than what I need(confident won't burn out when using and will last longer than the cheaper blenders marketed to the average consumer)."
1,It leaks after only a year of use.,"I am shopping now for a replacement gasket, but you have to buy the entire carafe, best price so far is $40. This looks to be a design flaw based on the other reviews I have read."
2,Bummed,"I bought this blender a month ago, and loved it. I used it to make green smoothies, and it pulverized greens and frozen fruit effortlessly. But then last night, the blade attachment which also allows it to fit snugly into the base came loose, causing the smoothie to leak out the bottom of the pitcher, and leaving bits of the broken attachment in my smoothie.I expect wear and tear after extended use, but not after one month. I loved this item while it lasted, but will not buy a KitchenAid blender again."
5,Love it!,"Every day I will say to my husband, ""I love my new blender"". I know it sounds crazy that I could be so excited about a small kitchen appliance, but I am. It's not only aesthetically pleasing to look at, but it's quiet (except when using the crushed ice setting) and constructed in such a way that cleaning is easy and there are no parts that you can't get clean. You know those old fashioned seals and leaky containers? Not anymore. This is so wisely constructed. I use mine almost everyday for protein shakes etc. If you need a blender, I would definitely recommend this one! I love it!"
2,GREAT BLENDER THAT LEAKS,"I USE MY BLENDER JUST TO MAKE SMOOTHIES EVERY DAY OR TWO, USING SPINACH LEAVES, MANGO, PAPAYA, APPLES, BANANAS, AND GROUND NUTS & SEEDS, NOTHING TOUGH. THIS BLENDER HAS A VERY HEAVY AND STABLE BASE WITH SEALED BUTTONS SO NO OPENINGS FOR FOOD TO GET IN. IT IS QUIETER (THEY ARE ALL NOISY) THAN MOST OTHERS. THE PITCHER IS LARGE AND CIRCULATES THE INGREDIENTS VERY WELL. IT HAS A SLOW START FEATURE FOR A SECOND OR TWO THAT AVOIDS THROWING EVERYTHING AT THE TOP ON START UP.OTHER SMART FEATUES TOO, BUT IT IS ALL MEANINGLESS BECAUSE IT LEAKS.I TOOK MY FIRST ONE BACK AND GOT A REPLACEMENT. FIRST USE IT LEAKED TOO, SO I TOOK IT BACK AND NOW I AM TRYING ANOTHER BRAND."
1,It Leaks!!,"The first few weeks this blender was amazing. I do smoothies constantly--it's a great, easy way to get tons of nutrition in a short amount of time--so I did my research and concluded that this was the best blender for my needs and my price range. At first it worked great but then I noticed it was starting to slightly leak when I would use the higher speed settings. The leak gradually got worse and now, I can't make anything without creating a huge mess and loosing a large amount of my drink. Amazon and Kitchen Aid both were no help in fixing the problem. I've passed my 'window to return' even though it's a defective blender and Kitchen Aid won't do anything because the entire top piece would have to be replaced. There is a HUGE flaw in the blade system--there is no way to tighten it and comes loose quickly with any use. DO NOT BUY THIS BLENDER. Spend your money on something better!"
1,"Defective design, Rotating gear wears out fast","Wife bought this through her amazon account - so I'm not a ""confirmed"" buyer. But we bought to make smoothies. First one, the plastic gear that the carafe has at the bottome which connects to the plastic insert at the base wore out within a month and it started shredding the plastic. A couple of times, the carafe was stuck on the base and had to be pried off.KitchenAid replaced with new and paid shipping both ways. Nice.2nd one, we used differently and followed their advice. Don't hold down the top while running and put ice cubes at the top. The second one lasted about 4 months. I'm on hold with KitchenAid as i write this. Hoping to get a replacement and we won't be using this much (bought a vitamix instead).I have a feeling most of the people who are happy with this device don't use it much. Bad bad bad design."
1,Coupling is made of cheap rubber and will break apart.,"The coupling that turns the blades is made of a cheap rubber-like substance and will fall apart in no time at all. I've gone through one with very little use. Luckily they are cheap on Amazon and fairly easy to replace, but they should recall this part as it is clearly a defective POS."
1,I've had a year of disappointment with this terrible blender,"A long-time devotee of the KitchenAid brand, I sprung the $100 for this model, after disappointment with a smoothie blender's inability to handle frozen fruit. This blender performs terribly under all conditions. It never, never crushes the ice fine enough for a smoothie. Hollandaise making is a mess - the butter and egg spatter out the top feeder hole. Hot chocolate bits never fully get incorporated, as the wide bottom of the jar is designed for spattering out rather than blending in. The blade nut has loosened several times this year, causing leaks, and requiring that I grip the sharp blade itself in order to re-secure the nut. And it is a challenge to clean, since you cannot disassemble the jar. And it isn't very good with frozen fruit in smoothies, either. I recommend a $35 Oster, with a glass jar and a metal motor drive (which is plastic on this KitchenAid, which I recently bought, and performs well."
4,great blender but hate the lid,"so far so good with this new blender. the lid does not go and and off very easy but it does work great and we like that we do not have to disassemble it to clean it, dry it and reassemble it each time."
5,Worth the money.,Pulverizes ice. Blends quickly. Easy to use. Easy to clean. It is worth the money. I have wasted my time and money on cheaper blenders that can't do the job. Very happy with this one.
1,Blender started leaking on 3rd use,I would not purchase this item again. The blender broke on the 3rd use. The seal in the bottom of the jar broke and I had smoothie all over my counter within minutes.
4,Blender did leak but...,"I bought this blender 6 weeks ago and when reading reviews I found that several people said that the base leaks. I decided to buy it anyway as Kitchenaide has such a good reputation. After 6 weeks of making a green smoothie every day, the base started leaking. Luckily I sent in the warranty card when I got the blender. I called kitchenaide and they sent out a replacement carafe right away. They also gave me another year's warranty on the blender. So yes the review was correct but Kitchenaide DID stand behind their product AND was very prompt in replacing the carafe. I didn't even have to send the old carafe back. One thing they did suggest is that when you use anything frozen that you use the crush ice feature which I had not done so I will be doing that from now on."
2,6 Weeks of Love and then...,"After 18 years of wedded bliss and sub-par smoothies from a $20 wedding gift blender, my wife and I were ready to upgrade. We researched blenders on our favorite, trusted advisor- America's Test Kitchen- and decided to buy the KitchenAid blender. When it arrived, we wasted no time in making amazing smoothies, salsa and soup. We were in love. And then...Six weeks later, my wife made her nasty green smoothie for breakfast. She noticed that the smoothie had leaked onto the base and that the blades were loose. Thanks to the pictures on Amazon, I was able to tighten the nut (COUNTER-CLOCKWISE!) and now it doesn't leak. But I am leery of its performance capabilities moving forward. I don't know how long my DIY fix will last. Knowing what I know now, I would have saved a little longer and bought something else."
1,Flawed design,"Haven't used very much and all of a sudden, jar container began leaking through the bottom. When I cleaned the horrid mess up, noted that the blade had loosened from the nut under the jar. Contents of jar infiltrated the motor and damaged operation. Following the major clean, tightening nut, and drying out of motor, retried: exactly the same result. Rubber from the gasket started to spin out the bottom of the jar. Called customer service, and like other posters, I was outside (by only 5 months) warranty. They offered a 30% disc on a replacement. Based on others' reviews, I will try another brand. Definitely something wrong here."
2,Jar leaked after 15 months,"I used an Oster for 12 years and decided to get a bigger blender after it's broken. Since I have a wonderful KitchenAid refrigerator, I went with this blender. Unfortunately, it has a serious design flaw - the plastic jar is not strong enough for the operations. After using it for three times a week for 15 months, the bottom of the jar started to crack and eventually leaked while blending. A replacement jar is costly and there's no guarantee it won't leak again based on feedback from other reviewers. I do NOT recommend this blender and will go with a different brand next time."
1,Leaks everytime we use it,We got this as a replacement for an older Kitchenaid with the glass jar. My wife likes smoothies for her diet and will use one a lot. Less than two weeks after the purchase it started leaking from the bottom. I tried tightening the assembly (which was loose) and it lasted for less than 5 minutes. You just can't get it tight enough to seal.Stay away from this piece of garbage. Looks like we'll need a real one.
5,Kitchen Aid 5 speed blender's Awesome,this is the most efficient blender I have ever had the pleasure of using. It actually does crush ice...big cubes not the little ones....it's got so much power...I love it.
1,Stay Away !,"Very disappointed in the longevity of this blender. Bought it three months ago and use it five to seven times per week. The reason I purchased it was because of the chopped ice feature for making smoothies. After several usings, the lock nut at the bottom of the plastic pitcher unwinds itself, allowing liquids to pour out of the bottom before the blending is finished. After each use the nut has to be retightened, and even that does not prevent the flow of liquid onto the motor mount."
2,Leaky Carafe,I was really disappointed with this blender. I got it as a gift about 9 mo ago. It had started leaking a considerable amount when I blend from below the carafe.
3,Pitcher completely stripped,I would give this blender 5 stars because it did work great. I bought it from Costco a little over 2 years ago and suddenly the part of the pitcher that attaches to the base completely strips and became smooth. Unfortunately the blender only has a 1 year warranty. I will probably buy the same one again but I am dissapointed that it did that. I looked into just replacing the pitcher but it's $50 so for a few dollars more it's better to replace the whole thing.
1,Bottom of pitcher leaks,"Like other reviewers, my pitcher leaks from the bottom and with only a 1 year warranty, not much I can do other than pay for another. The nut under the blade housing will not stay tight, which loosens the bottoms seal to the pitcher and causes it to leak. Constant cleaning of counter, blender base etc etc. It's just a poor design. Also the clear plastic pitcher is showing signs of internal cracking. This unit was purchased in August 07 and really has not been used very much, maybe once a month. I really wish I had my old school reliable Oster bee hive back. Buy something else."
2,Nut comes lose,"So, when I bought this blender I did a lot of research because I want to make copy kat recipes of starbucks that I dream up. Everything was going pretty good for the first month, then I noticed that it was leaking majorly around where the blade is screwed into the base of the jar. I found the jar for $25 but I don't want to spend 25% of what I spent on the blender on just the jar and the same thing happen in a few months. I love KitchenAid and have always trusted them to sell durable products, however no more. Do NOT buy this blender. Find another, you might have to pay more then $100, but it's worth it."
3,It's pretty...,"But it did not take long until the seal around the blade assembly started leaking. Noise and vibration are very annoying on the highest settings, and the plastic vessel is no longer clear and bright as food has scratched up the inside. On our old model, the glass was much durable through years of use. Wish I had saved that part!"
4,blender,"The first blender I rec'd had a hot aroma when started and soon would pop a circ breaker..I returned it and rec'd another..it seems to function normally.I do like the power of the motor and the various settings available. cleaning the jar would be alot easier if one could remove the chopper device from the jar, also , removing the end product is a bit difficult with the ""spinner"" device still in the jar!"
2,WAY TO CHEAPEN IT UP,"I have an older model kitchenaid with glass container and removeable bottom for cleaning, excellent machine. Went to buy a new one for my daughter and was very disapointed with the one piece plastic container, which I could fortell the future of major problems. Glad I read customer reviews first. DID NOT BUY, CHEAP, CHEAP, CHEAP."
2,Works great til it falls apart.,"I had one for over 2 years then the gear that fits into the base stripped and fell apart. Bought a second one 4 months ago and the gear is already ruined. Gear can't be replaced, so replacement is only option. Very powerful, perhaps that's what destroys the gear. The gear isn't made to withstand the speed & power - rather stupid."
2,Leaky,"I loved this blender for about two years, until the pitcher started leaking. I can't use it at all any more."
3,"Good, for awhile","Yes, it blends well. It also requires you to hold it while it blends on high (otherwise you'll have a 10 lb unit crashing to the floor). But the real shame is that after about 9 months, the bottom started leaking. It's now unusable. I had read reviews from 2008 that mention this flaw but assumed that by July 2009, Amazon would no longer be selling the flawed version. I was wrong."
1,Leakage problem after less than one month,"We bought a Kitchenaid KSB560 blender over Christmas from Amazon after extensive research. Even though I read about people who had problems with the leaky rubber gasket underneath the jar, I thought this would have been rectified since this is a relatively easy engineering fix. To my disappointment, three weeks into using the new blender, we noticed the rubber gasket started to melt and smoothie was sipping out from the jar. I would strongly suggest prospective buyers do not take this design flaw lightly. We did not even use the blender to crush ice or do any ""heavy lifting"" task =("
2,Good until it breaks,"Excellent in use. Good power, sealed keypad is easy to clean (just wipe off). Pulse feature is nice.The basic problem is the bearing (or lack thereof) for the blade, which is at the bottom of the jar assembly. This eventually becomes more and more resistant to turning as the blender is used over the years.The blade assembly is driven by the base. The connection is some hard rubber teeth. Eventually, these shear off because of the resistance in the assembly above.So the entire mixer, motor, etc. is done in by a few dollars worth of failing rubber parts--requiring replacement of the whole thing."
1,Sleepy Mouse,This mouse is hard to get it to attach. Had to fight it each time I logged onto my laptop. Then it drops off unexpectidly. Skips around so bad that you have to watch the screen constantly. Often you loose an entire e-mail message before completion. It's in the junk drawer now (but not collecting germs). Logitech MX610 Left Hand is the Cat's MEOW!
5,Germ-Free Wireless Laser Mouse,"Great mouse! I like the small size, compared to what I was used to using. I don't know if it's protecting me from germs, but I do like the feel of it. The cursor is sensitive but I'll get used to it!"
2,Tracks Rubber Foot (Flex Tip),"Tracks Rubber Foot (Flex Tip)This was a BIG disappointment. The rubber foot was about one third of the original size foot. Yes, it says (Flex tip) in the title but it has a picture of the original larger foot with the title. It also has 4 other tempting items in the picture Suggesting they all come as a set and this was very Misleading. If you order this you only receive one item: a flex tip about as wide as your middle finger and almost 2 inches long."
1,HURRY BEFORE THEY'RE GONE!,"EVERY DVD release is a ""limited addition"" because nothing stays in print forever and new formats are always on the horizon. This is a sales gimmic as old as ""hurry, hurry, step right up!""What a rip off. I'll be skipping this dated gem at this price."
4,Typical Fox,"The astronomical price of the Land of the Giants dvd set is typical of Fox's pricing for many of their dvd sets. Consider; following the success of a number of their tv series, (one whole season in one set), they now choose to split seasons so they can double-charge! I say, BOYCOTT and wait to buy it used. This is a primary reason for all the boot-legging of tv dvds! Great series, nonetheless... But why no cast commentaries?"
1,$179 it's outrageous!,"At $149 it was expensive, but at $179 it's outrageous. Lose the fancy packaging and promotional material (if you have to) and bring the price down. Way down."
3,Land of the Giants Complete Season,"The episodes are classic Sci-fi and a perfect addition to our ""Lost in Space"" and ""Time Tunnel"" collections. The set comes in a ""wooden cage"" carrying box with a replica of small comic books and a souvenir keychain of the lost ship.The special effects are amazing for the time and you really get a sense that the castaways are little people in a land of giants."
3,PAYING FOR NOSTALGIA,I agree with some of the commentaries above regarding this over the top and beyond price. I counted myself among those die-hards cult fans but this is really going too far. What many people are paying for this is not only so much a series as a return to our childhood. Much cheaper to look at other Irwin Allen's - and much better series - such as Voyage to the bottom of the Sea for that matter. Enrique Terol (Spain).
3,Bad Marketing Idea. Price is unreasonable,I really would like to have this show. The only reason would be because I used to watch this when I was a kid and have some good memories associated with it. I would be happy to purchase this item for about 20 dollars per season. If anyone who is involved in marketing this DVD happens to read this you might consider forgetting your greed and just selling this product for a reasonable price. I will NEVER pay more than 20 dollars per season for this.
5,Great irwin allen classic,I bought some of the episodes from columbia house at first and when i found out they were going to be released i sold all the discs i had on amazon.I made most of my money back and saved it till the release on amazon.I waited for some time hoping it would come down and one day i was checking amazon and found the gold box deal and grabbed it.I paid 99.00 for it and was very happy i didint have to spend 199.00.I loved the series when i was a kid and when it arrived i was a happy camper.The prints are fantastic and the box it came in was a nice extra.I always like fancy boxes that some dvds or sets come in.If i was looking to buy one i would check amazon once a day to see if its on sale.It seems to happen alot for this set.I would not have paid the full price.
2,not great,"It was cheaper than the other headache reliever headband replacement inserts so I tried it. The massive gel filled tube lasted about 10 zaps and then melted on the ends. However, this worked out for the best as I filled a sock with bulk seed from WF and it stayed warm as long with no chance of melting."
2,Digital Art,"I purchased this book for an introductory digital art class and ended up not using it. The writting is not the best and I feel there wasn't enough visual information in this book. Some of the artists the author mentions are wonderful, but overall it was rather dissapointing."
2,Horrible.,"CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP PRODUCT. Being an assembler myself I find it embarrassing when I put together a product that does not even have bolt holes that properly line up. The fact that this was built in Canada frightens me, I thought it was a Chinese product. The person who champions the bolts at the fab must really enjoy their job since the threads hardly existed on the ends. Two pieces that were supposed to be the exact same were visibly different.I just cannot believe someone would put their company's name on this and send it out the door."
2,Orly Draw A Story - Unfortunate Disappointment,"I loved the product when my children used it years ago. When I saw they had it available on Amazon I purchased it for my local elementary school to use with the younger students who were learning about the Caribbean. However, we were not able to install the software because the technology was not compatible with the new computer systems."
5,Celtic Moods is a good CD.,Celtic Moods is a really good CD. I like it alot. But then again I like anything IRISH. I've lost this CD a few times over the years and this is probably the 3rd time I had to buy the CD and I have no regrets. My favorite song on the CD is probably Ashley MacIsaacs Sleepy Maggie. Awesome song.
1,"Please, when are you delivering on my puschase?",I am yet to receive this book - after more than a month of paying for it.
4,"If you liked 2004, you'll like '05","The new edition has some added features like projected career totals and injury projections, but the meat of it is similar to what appeared in 2004. For stats junkies who just want the numbers, it's a great book. For those who prefer Prospectus and their comments (for better or, often, worse), this may be a disappointment because of its lack of commentary on players.There is some discussion of items like the career projections and injury projections, but no essays that make his Abstracts or other books like Win Shares so popular. I'd definitely consider this a must for 2005 - a concise, easy to use guide to the essential stats that can be kept on your coffee table all season - but I wouldn't recommend it for anyone who doesn't share an obsession with stats."
5,Appropriate Education for Little Ones,"As a teacher with many years experience with kids 2-7 years, I feel that this this kit is much more appropriate than many of the ""learning"" items on the market currently. Basically, it covers much of the information that you might learn if you went to get a 2 year early childhood degree. Please spend your money and time on things like this rather than all of the ""ABC"" and ""123"" stuff out there. So much of it is inappropriate for children under the age of 4 years. This item is going to promote social, emotional, physical, and academic growth that is much better for your child in the long run"
4,Try this stuff!,"My sister got me some of this cologne and I liked it so much (ok, my wife liked it too), I wore it at my wedding last month. Try it out. You won't be disappointed."
1,VERY POOR PRODUCT,"The product I received was obviously diluted with alcohol, decreasing its staying power. The scent would evaporate in a matter of minutes. I found the 1.7oz at Marshalls for $8. I suggest you do the same."
5,Love this cologne!,Love this cologne! This is my favorite scent that my boyfriend wears. It smells so sexy.
4,Amazing value and smells fantastic,"I bought this cologne for my husband. It smells clean and manly with a touch of a musky scent. This was the first time he has ever repurchased the same cologne he had been wearing previously. That's how good it smells. When I ordered this, I didn't pay much attention to the size I was ordering, but holy cow! This bottle is enormous. For $25, we now have a huge bottle of cologne that will probably last for a few years."
3,the perfume works fine but...,"the perfume works fine but...the price keeps dropping after I bought it.it should not be a problem but since I am in Accounting, it means something."
2,You get what you pay for,"Overall product was off in measurement by a milimeter, but that was enough for me to have to pound it onto my bar with a hammer! It is now a perminent fixture to my bar! Its deffinatey china poor QC. Spend the extra money and buy a US made product..."
3,Entertaining silliness,"Be warned that this silly paperpack is NOT serious scholarly research! However, it was more relevant than most mass-market fluff on the subject (perhaps without intending to be so), and there is a lot of useful stuff ""between the lines"" (again, quite possibly unintentional). The entire book is crammed with literally hundreds of ""case studies"" of alleged contact with multidimensional entities. Alas, many of the cases seem to lack credibility, and might well have been excerpted from the Weekly World News! This was a fun book to read -- even if it is full of B.S. -- and it's probably the best work that Brad Steiger has ever done."
2,Gong hee Fot Choy,Very disappointed as I expected the original...The only original thing in this book appeared to be the cover.
1,i got sick!!,"after the read all reviews i decide the try this product the 1 time i drink i dont like the taste i feel alitle funny okay i give a second try next day i got so sick i spend the whole nitgh sick my stomag hurt so much so becarfull ,i put this in the trash i will never try this again"
4,Emma Stone not nearly hot/cute enough for Ryan Gosling,"""And I say this with an unblemished record of staunch heterosexuality"" (Costanza) - Ryan Gosling is painfully handsome.Emma Stone on the other hand is 'kinda cute' at best and even her personality in this movie is just 'average' for a typical scattered, clueless, annoying girl with some previous boyfriend PTSD. She almost derailed this otherwise very funny and smart (for a romantic comedy) movie for me.Ok now despite my previous point I really enjoyed this movie when I had expected to hate it. The cast, Emma Stone aside, was excellent, the soundtrack was cool, and the movie was funny and entertaining. I would definitely recommend it to other dudes looking to score a point with their lady."
2,Slow and Predictable,"All my friends wanted to see this movie. I finally gave it watched it, and I was expecting something better from Julian Moore for being a high caliber actress. Then I remembered Alex Baldwin's quote that actors are like plumbers who don't make money unless he/she performs the job, and can't pick and choose always when they have bills to pay.Slow and not funny and very predictable. Watch it with no expectation. Only remotely funny part was when they were having a parants meeting with Marisa Tomei (the teacher). what a waste of time and money."
4,Great movie until the ending,"If there was a movie I could compare this to it would be to ""Dan in Real Life"" which also starred Steve Carrell. Both movies are smarter than most comedies and say a lot about family dynamics. Both are also flawed in a lot of little ways that lessen your enjoyment. So much in ""Crazy, Stupid, Love"" is funny and entertaining, particularly the Carrell and Gosling scenes and the Gosling and Emma Stone scenes. Where it doesn't always work is with the babysitter and Carrell's son who is 13 to her 17. After a film that's heavy on realism, the babysitter does something not only illegal but also unlikely at the end of the film that felt like something you'd find in a regular ""American Pie"" movie instead of the decent one they'd created here. Other than that, really good."
2,This movie is sappy garbage,How this move got any 4 and 5 star ratings I have no clue. Typical Steve Carrell - funny for about 20 minutes and then trying to teach the audience a lesson for the rest of the movie. Save your money and rent something else.
3,Fantastic movie...Ultraviolet copy worthless!,"Loved this movie in theaters and ordered very excited to see a digital copy included. I didn't know that this ""Ultraviolet copy"" would be such a pain and can't play on my ipad without an internet connection. I hope hollywood wakes up asap and realizes customers don't want this!"
2,Useless,"Pathetic american stereotypical BS without a meaning. A movie for people 50+ at least. Nothing unexpected there. I dont hold anything against movies with a happy ending but the end of this movie is so horribly cheesy, unapproached. Not even a nuclear mushroom cloud could have disturbed the overwhelming sunshine, love and hapiness without a reason at the end. And not only the end. The womanizer, who becomes the good seriously loving guy; the cheating, depressed housewife, who finally realizes its better to be back at the old bump and grind instead of experiencing the uncertain. Give me a break! And finally, he was better at "" The Office"". Summary: Not worth seeing. If you wanna know which movies to watch, here's a list:Fight Club, 25 hours, Limitless, Heat and of course Hang Over I and IIAnd for all the ones, that cant live without heartsy fartsy movies: ""Friends with benefits""....one of the better onesSo long folks and thanks for all the fish"
4,"Crazy, Stupid, Love","This movie was good, lengthily and slow in some parts but overall it was a good movie and the actors are is a good in it."
5,Perfect!!!,"This is the 2nd time I have seen this movie, and I have loved it each time. Steve Carrell, Ryan Gosling - both perfect. Must see for anyone who is a fan of these two actors. It will make you smile."
1,"Great movie, but Ultraviolet Digital Copy Sucks!","I won't buy this until Warner Brothers adds the iTunes Digital Copy back. Good movie, crappy Flixster App and limitations of Ultraviolet. I can't stream it to my Apple TV, or easily sync it with my iPhone or iPad. Pure crap."
1,So boring,"I was absolutely shocked at how much I hated this movie. The plot moved painfully slow, and was almost 100% predictable."
4,Good movie,"I loved this movie, it is fun to watch, sweet story lines and the acting it's very well played. I loved how they show 3 different stories that are very complicated of every generation and at the end they are all connected. Super sweet movie."
4,"I thought this movie was very good at showing that there is a ""soulmate"" for all of us!","I loved it. Made me cry, laugh, and god the guy from the notebook is sooo hot!!!!Love it! I can relate somewhat into this storyline, I happen to believe that there is a soulmate for everyone of us, and sometimes it may lose its fizzle. the fact that they all were able to work things out in the end is touching. I truly would recommend this movie."
3,Good to see once - on a Sunday night,"The cast all had good chemistry and this movie definitely had funny moments - but also some cliche moments, but what do you expect when you have a movie about love?"
2,Being A Player,"So Steve Carrell is in this movie. Julianne Moore is in this movie. And some other actors are in this movie. I thought it would be a nice romantic comedy to watch with my wife. Maybe I should have read a little more about the premise.I'll admit, we only watched about half of the movie before we turned it off. I'm sure the movie ended fine with everyone finding a stable relationship, but up to the point I watched, I didn't like the message. And that message was that it's cool and all right to be a player.Let's not mention the disturbing crush the babysitter has on Steve Carrell's character and the disturbing position the babysitter finds the son of Steve Carrell's character. Both deal with minor children and it made me uncomfortable.Overall, I didn't care for any of it. Yes, I'm a prude, and if you are too, avoid this movie."
2,Not what I expected.,"Crazy, Stupid, Love is good for two reasons: Julianne Moore and Emma Stone. There are the only two characters that have any emotional depth and realness. Everyone else is one-dimensional and transparent. This is probably Ryan Gosling's weakest performance, he just stands there looking sexy...he adds nothing and then suddenly his character does a 180 and all of a sudden he's a good guy instead of a player? Guys don't usually change their bad boy ways that quickly! Steve Carell wasn't very relatable as well. Marisa Tomei tries too hard to be outrageous, it just comes off as bad acting. And the whole 13 year-old boy who has an obsessive crush on his 17 year-old babysitter was just plain horrible! I wanted to like this movie but it wasn't funny or cute, or heck even romantic! Oh well..."
1,The Trailer Was The Best Part of the Film,"The Trailer Was The Best Part of the Film!This trailer looked so interesting. However, when i went to see the film, it was just awful. My levl of excitement dropped a 100% and i was actually dreading every minute of it. This film tried to be lovey dovey. It was just painful to watch. The film didn't even know what it wanted to be. It wasn't sure if it wanted to a be a comedy or a drama and it didn't have what it takes to be a dramedy. The funny thing is, the cast was amazing and yet they just couldn't deliver. I don't know if it was the script, or the chemistry, but it was painful to watch such brilliant actors participate in such a horrific film.I am the hugest Steve Carrell and Julianne Moore fan and i know Steve can do drama. Anyways, skip this film and watch something else."
1,Like soft drink with lots of saccharine,"I watched this movie because there were many good reviews. Technically, the movie is not boring but the characters, like the movie title suggests, are stupid in ways that are not likable. This can make the viewers feel good while watching. It's like soft drink with lots of saccharine."
2,Candy Coated,"Going through divorce is never like this. Both jump straight out of their admittedly routine nuclear family into bed with even more self absorbed, dull, drab, unsympathetic, tedious, and bitter sex partners. The Kevin Bacon and Marisa Tomei characters should have at least APPEARED to fill the needs that our married couple had been so lacking. And what 17yo girl gives a 13yo boy nude photos of herself?"
3,horrible except for...,"David Duchovny, of course! the only reason i purchased this video, not from Amazon, but nevertheless, is to see the hottest man alove---David Duchovny. He looks sooooo hot in that cowboy hat. I wish i was Robin Wright for a few minutes. :) The movie is BAD. But if you're a DD fan, check it out, and prepare for a lot of fast forwarding. Bye."
2,Barely Edible,"Was a good product in theory but the oatmeal was flavorless, the fruits were ok, and it contained hard chunks that would not soften even after reheating it for an extra 1 minute.Seriously not worth buying but i do recommend the black bean soup. It kicks ass."
4,Very nice!!,These retro glasses are so cool. I also got the desert bowls and pitcher as a gift for Christmas. Anyone who remembers going camping or having a picnic in the back yard should get this set.
2,missed the mark,"This memory foam pillow is too small to work - it crunches down to practically nothing, making it useless to separate the knees in sleep."
3,"Helpful, but too soft","I bought this on the recommendation of my kinesiologist (chiropractor), who thinks it will help with hip alignment/back pain issues. I had high hopes, but the memory foam is so soft that once it warms up from my body heat, it's compresses to nearly flat between my knees. The shape is smart and functional. It stays with me all night, but I wish it wasn't memory foam, or that is was just plain thicker in the center."
1,Save the money on this cheap piece of junk...,"No real support. Very flimsy construction. I would not buy again. If it offered ANY SUPPORT AT ALL, it would have been useful, but this thing is just too cheap and flimsy to be of much use to anyone."
1,Contour Memory Foam Leg Pillow,"I concur with the reviewers, who concluded the Contour Memory Leg Pillow is too soft and therefore worthless. My pre-purchase medical condition was and is right leg supination. I need a devise, which provides stabilization of the leg when I am sleeping. The Contour Memory Foam Leg Pillow is an absolute and utter failure because it provides no support to keep my leg from rotating."
3,Difficult to categorise,"Great cast. Great writing. Difficult subject matter.The show aired on HBO - not surprising given some of the graphic sex scenes. But also not surprising that there was no second series despite great potential. Although the topics explored are highly relevant and important, some of the scenes are laughable and make a mockery of what should be very emotional to the viewers.This show didn't really fit into typical HBO genre, in my opinion, but would never have been accepted by a cable network the way it was shot.I still enjoyed the performances as the cast was brilliant."
3,Don't pay more than $10 for the DVD,"Just ordered the show a week ago and total cost (including shipping) was under $10 so no reason to pay more than that at this point.Show is okay. I'd give it 5 stars just for Michelle Borth but realistically, the show is mediocre otherwise. Drags on and the story is predictable."
3,"Hmmm, why did I buy this? Naked Ian maybe?","Yes I purchased this to watch Ian because you just can't find soft porn on YouTube. Now that I've watched it all, its pretty clear why this series was cancelled. The premise -> we are watching the lives of essentially 4 couples varying so differently in age (20s-30s-40s-50s) that the show is NOT targeted to any group in particular. So you just jump from one couple to another couple when you find their scene painfully boring. You crave some action. You want a character you can actually like and identify with but these characters do not make it easy.With that said, it still gets 3 stars from me only because of Ian."
2,Big disappointment,"The previews leading up to this show filled me with anticipation. I was heartbroken with 'John From Cincinnati' ending and hoped that this could make up for it.What I anticipated was a show with intelligent, gripping writing. What I got was one boring episode after another with some Skinemax thrown in for good measure. What happened in this show? I could of watched the first and the last episode and not missed anything. The stories moved so damn slow, but I hung in there and watched every episode waiting to be rewarded for my patience. And I got nothing.All in all, the most disappointing HBO series to date. To top it off, this gets extended (no doubt plenty of people loved the graphic sex scenes), and JFC gets cancelled."
5,Secrets of delight,Sylvian surely reaches the top of its production with this album. Let the flow of gentle emotions blow into your soul and your mind will disappear in a thin ocean of sophisticated poetry.
2,Dissappointed,I like the concept of the book and thought the exercises were very worthwhile but the poor writing quality made it very difficult to follow and the DVD was certainly not of the quality I would expect. I have read several books on golf specific fitness and this one is at the bottom of the list.
1,"Because there is no way to rate ""no star""","Vacuous, self-indulgent, self-involved, and ultimately tragic because his existence in the media is a reflection of what the current market is willing to support and encourage.Read it and weep."
2,Could not finish it,"Mancow is a very engaging radio host and his book is written in the fast pace, with the energy he is known for. It started out interesting enough, but seemed to digress into the acid trip that is Mancow's mind. I eventually put the book down for good."
3,Rock and roll at risk - strong language and violence,"When The Perceptions rock group member JJ Jeffries is murdered it's up to detective Nicky Rachmaninoff to find the murderer. As he unravels the mystery it seems nearly everyone in the music industry, and even the Mafia, wants the members dead. Each time Nick thinks he's figured it out and is about to make an arrest, the person dies.There's too much violence in this one for my taste, and the language is equally offensive."
1,did not like,"i didn't like the transfer on the shirt... on a larger shirt,, its way way to small...parts of it is blurry,, just a real disappointment...."
2,Disresepctful and dismissive,"We wanted very much to like this book -- it is, after all, about two of our favorite subjects (history and science)!Sadly, we found that it was disrespectful of Mesopotamian accomplishments, deriding this ancient people for not thinking like modern people do. We gave up partway through, even thought the science was interesting, because the heavy layer of unwarranted judgement made the book unreadable for us.I hope later cultures are treated more respectfully."
3,Be prepared...,"...to spend at least an hour putting this together. Although assembly is quite simple, the overall design of this unit left me wanting to shoot myself. Get a measuring tape and start the installation in the middle (yes, middle). You have to screw nuts on from each end of the rods, and not all the nuts fit perfectly so you may have to use the included wrench to move them along. Have a measuring tape handy, you'll need it.It IS sturdy and even with the additional drawer unit on the bottom (purchased separately), there is still plenty of space to have at least 5 inches between shelves which should accommodate just about any piece of electronic equipment. Unless you have a large receiver or something out of the ordinary.Wire management will be a different story all together, I also purchased the suggested wire manager for this unit, but it comes with no mounting brackets or even double sided tape. The shelving unit only came with 3 zip-ties, so have more on hand."
3,Ok,"I thought this movie was ok, I wouldn't sit through it again and I would only recommend it if you have nothing else to do!"
3,Good movie.,It's good entertainment. The movie was fun. It was not too cliche in terms of black movies. It's an enjoyable film.
4,Shocked that I liked it!,"This is definately not a Tyler Perry movie. I thought this might be similar to one of his movies. By the way, I am not a Perry fan. I enjoyed the acting and the story line. I loved Angela Bassett and the character she played. The writing was good and I found the characters believable. I thought the ending lacked depth and it just ended - that was a big let down for me. It was well worth the $1 I paid to rent it."
5,Great Reference Piece,"You will not find a more comprehensive listing of psychological terms with an appropriate correlation to what the Bible has to say about the issue anywhere else. This should be in the library of every pastor and every person doing counseling/discipling.Not only does it give a correlation, it also gives a brief game plan of how to help someone put into practice what the bible has to say about their issue.Could be used along with the discipleship manual ""Self-Confrontation"" to help someone really grow in the Lord."
1,"Terrible book, not worth the money!","I am a big fan of Todd Lammle, I used his books exclusively to get my CCNA. This book, however, falls short. It does not cover the exam materials very well at all. In fact, it does not cover MAJOR areas of the exam. Anyone who reads this book and passes the test is LUCKY. My friend bought this book, read it and failed the test! (and this friend is no dummy)...I borrowed and read this book cover-to-cover and was doing terrible on the test simulators (Boson). I went out and purchased the Cisco Press ""CCDA Exam Certification Guide, (ISBN# 0735700745)"" and read IT cover to cover. Immediately, the questions on the simulators started making sense. I then took the test and passed with flying colors. I gave the Cisco book to my friend who read it and passed the exam.We both agree that having read both books, this one was a complete waste of time.Best of luck to you,Joel HelgesonCCNA, CCDA, CQS, MCSE +I, Network+ & A+"
3,Just Enough to Pass,"I passed my CCDA exam on 10-11-2000 using only the Sybex study guide and with no networking experience other than the Sybex CCNA sudy guide and the CCNA exam I passed.I scored 100% on 6 of the 10 sections of the 640-441 and passed with a 815. I studied and knew that study guide very well and thought there were several points that the book didn't address but the thourough knowledge of the other subject areas gave me enough points to pass. This was a very difficult exam for me, especially having no hands-on knowledge of networking. This book alone should be more than adequate to pass this exam for anyone with a reasonable knowledge of Networking.Good luck everyone!"
2,Incomplete,"CCDA Study Guide 2nd Edition for 640-861By Todd Lammle & Andy BarklBy SYBEX ""The Leader in Certification"" Hah !ISBN 0-7821-4200-1Purchased Nov 2003Exam Jan 2004Mark achieved high 700's, but not enough to pass.There is no doubt that there are some accurate and well written sections to this book. Unfortunately they do not make up for the whole topic areas in the exam that are not covered in the book and other areas that are at best covered only glibly. As I went through the exam I noted a minimum of 9 questions ( out of 72 ) that had not been covered in the book.The chapter end questions, two prep exams and the flash cards are extremely light weight, and give a totally false idea of the nature of the real exam.Would I recommend anyone rely on this book to pass 640-861 ?Absolutely not.Will I buy another Lammle / Sybex book ?Not if I can find something elseIt is a pity because Sybex produced very high quality training material at one time."
2,Don't waste your money :(,The book is full of contridictions and makes learning the material very difficult. I bought the 'Designing Cisco Networks' directly from Cisco and I am finally back on the right path. There are multiple questions in the book that have different answers on the CDROM.
1,do not waste your money,"i consider this book to be a waste . i bought this book and i compare it with top-down network design , and the dcn from cisco . Both by far superior texts ,if you want to take the test buy these two books and use cisco site ."
3,A ride on choppy waters,"If you have not passed the CCNA exam, do not even think of touching this CCDA book. The subject is treated in a choppy way, not lucidly. In my opinion a responsible writer/publisher should supply an errata list, preferably on the web, so the students can correct the subject matter. This book needs one. If one such list is published, where is it?"
1,it works... at first,"it works... at first.sort of.... well it needed it's pins flipped so pin heads were against trap wall or they fall out. peanutbutter jams it. sunflower seeds work good. caught allot and bought a second one, but after a while mice run in n out easy. my husband stalks and blocks the door behind them to catch em now. lame. thinking of trying a ""mouse depot""."
3,Catchmaster version,I have a Tin Cat version without the see through window already. It is very solid and handles the outdoors well. I needed at least 1 more so I ordered these. I got the Catchmaster version.1.) The Catchmaster version feels more flimsy. Looks to work the same so I don't expect it not to work.2.) The see through window is made of a thin piece of plastic. I see myself having to replace it with a thick piece of plexiglass very soon. i will have to cover these things up outside as larger animals will rip the plastic apart in no time and I can't sit a heavy object on this since it would crush the plastic.I really was hoping this came with a thick piece of plexiglass that wouldn't be damaged by just looking at it funny.
1,"should be AKA ""All You Can Eat - Buffet for Mice""","So I had purchased an original tin cat locally, but it was a pain checking to see if anything had been caught. I searched and found this clear top tin cat... read the reviews, seemed like the way to go.Once this 2pack arrived, I baited both of them with a dollop of peanut butter on a small cracker, placed in the center of the trap. I checked for several days before I saw that the cracker had moved. Perhaps the trap had been bumped. A day later, I saw little scratches in the peanut butter, but NO mouse was in the trap. I checked the other trap; the cracker had been flipped, and prior to the mouse exiting the trap, he (and perhaps several of his friends) relieved themselves inside the trap. I have a picture of this evidence that I will post if this review allows it.I could not recommend this trap to anyone with clever mice. If you have dense mice, well it might work out."
3,one summer of fun,We bought the so called 15x30 pool last July. It was not to bad to set up but it got over 100 degrees here for almost a month and the bottom and sides melted and wrinkled. We put it away in our garage for winter storage and set it up last week. The pool has so many holes in it that its now garbage! My best advice is to buy it somewhere that offeres the 1 year warranty as we did. So glad!
2,Looks pretty but poorly made,"Very badly constructed - the corners are pulling apart, and they arrived with numerous broken slats. The recommended brackets which I bought separately don't actually fit the window box either, so when trying to hang them on the wall it was a disaster because the arms on the brackets are too short. Unfortunately, the postage to Australia cost more than the window boxes, so returning them wasn't an option."
3,hit-or-miss,"This show has highs and lows, but it's full of hot people. The last seasons goes downhill, but this one's not bad."
4,"Inconsistent, but good","As with many shows, the second season is an marked improvement over the first. The actors, directors, producers, writers all have a more clear view of what their doing. Unfortunately, despite all the great fundamental elements of Roswell, the show still struggled in the second season. Plot lines moved a little to slowly and it wasn't clear where they wanted to go with the whole thing. The result is a slightly irritating inconsistent feel to the whole thing. Its still a great show, but it could easily have been better."
1,Huge Disappointment,"We got this for gnats, stink bugs and red mite thingys on our peppers and tomatoes. I followed directions and....it killed the plants! 4 pepper plants and 6 tomato plants are dead. Nothing but a brown stalk in the soil. Can't return it, so going to recycle it with other poisonous materials. Not organic in ANY way! I won't even go into the poor packaging that a good 1/3 of product leaked inside and through the box."
3,Getting mad...,"Ms. Too might be the author of the highest number of Feng Shui books published, but if you're like me and have read some of her other books, you are likely to get mad at yourself for having spent money an yet another one, when you should've learnt by now that they contain almost the same information.I've given this a three-star rating, because it does talk about some basic rituals, but they'll not do you any godd unless you're at a certain level of spiritual awareness and are aware of the fact that just flying some wish-baloons in the air will not make your wishes come true."
5,It was spectacular and around every turn was a new surprise,I thought that it was an amazing book that kept you guessing till the end. It was a spectacular book with adventure and danger around every corner.
2,A mistake,"I bought Lloyd's other book ""The Style Checklist: The Ultimate Wardrobe Essentials for You"" and I loved it. So I bought this one too, but isn't the same. Big, long, with litle information. Buy the other one."
1,"Poorly organized, scattered thoughts","This should have been sold as a Tip-of-the-Day Fashion Calendar. It's definitely not a fashion book. The book is very poorly organized. There are no sections, just days of the year. Who wants to scan a whole book for one or two helpful clues? The book is just full of scattered thoughts and is a pain to read. Avoid it. Instead check out The Science of Sexy by Bradley Bayou and How Not To Look Fat by Danica Lo. These are two excellent books."
1,Tribal? Don't think so...,"This compilation has got to be one of the cheesiest rip-offs I've ever bloody encountered! I've been DJ-ing for so long and frankly, this is nothing more than pure crap! Have a good listen to the song preview.. you'll understand what I'm saying then.."
1,Don't Use This Book!,"There are much, much better texts out there to learn Organic Chemistry. It is a shame that some prof's still use this grossly out-dated and non-mainstream text."
2,Poor quality control,I bought five of these. On three of them the pinhole for unlocking is significantly off center and the knob looks really bad. I expected better of Schlage.
1,Skip to Tubular Bells III,"Don't bother with this album - go immediately to III. Waste of money since the whole album seems to be spent trying to make the continuous soundtrack sound interesting but fails miserably. Pink Floyd is one of the few who can make a 15 minute riff sound great. However the III album has many different and varied sounds (not just noise like this one) going from the Exorcise sound, to hard rock, to spanish guitar, to vocals, to ....."
1,is there a rating less than 1?,"Had a listen to the HDCD remaster of this so-called classic album. What garbage. I'm a big fan of early FLoyd and Genesis so can appreciate conceptual albums, but they have something that TB is lacking...music.This is just an unconnected, often crude and grating, collection of seemingly disparate streams of music played on various high and low tech instruments.Must have been 'wacky' at the time, but now is impossible for me to listen to!"
5,Perfect,"I have recently been diagnosed with cancer and have turned into a germaphobe. My wife was skeptical whether we would use a dispenser, why not just wash your hands... I mounted it by the back entry door and use it multiple time a day, especially when coming in from outside...Purell seems to be the GOLD STANDARD, and every hospital and medical office I visit, I hit the Purell Sanitizer on the way out... and sometimes on the way in... and sometimes after handling things and opening doors...GREAT PRICE TOO"
2,Order Not Fully Satisfied,"I received the Purell NXT Dispenser, but did not receive the two NXT BIB 1000ml Refills. Had to look elsewhere to order them."
1,Nausicaä is one of the best films ever made.,"Studio Gihbli, who created the original Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind has asked us to forget this horrible hack job ever existed. The writer/director Miyazaki was extremely upset when he saw this video. As I write this (11/3) the new English dub by Disney is in production and will hopefully be available in the US soon. The new dub will be true to the original and will show it in it's full glory. Please wait for it's release. It'll be worth it."
3,Model ship,"Bought for my husband and son to do together. The pieces were really small and hard to see. They put it together, but lost some pieces because they were so tiny. Great price though. They still had fun building it together. Use magnifying glass maybe."
5,Great Product!!!!,I use it for my insulin pump infusion sites as well as my Dexcom CGM. It really holds them both great. My dexcom sensor is used for 7-14 days and with this product it always stays on. A little goes a long way and a small bottle last forever when applied with a q-tip!
4,A Dream of Freedom,"A stalwart narrative set in the 1930s A Dream of Freedom gives the reader a quick look into the vicissitudes of circumstance the Russian people were forced to withstand at the behest of their leaders. Filled with gritty, hard hitting dialogue, robust characters and a firm grip on history A Dream of Freedom is occupied with compelling well-drawn settings, remarkably engineered action and vigorous actors cannily portrayed by author Jordan."
2,"Awful, just awful","This book will mention the concept of how to implement something, but will not tell you in any way HOW to do it. a good example is adding an object to the begging of a list, or adding it somewhere in the middle. yes there is a method as part of the list class, but no where in the book does it say how it is written"
2,A Book,"In this book, a young boy named Eddie is convinced that the new school cafateria cook is Cupid by means of cookies and pins instead of the traditional bow and arrow. Anyone who eats a cookie and gets a pin ends up falling in love with someone . . . but it's always the wrong person. A 4th grade bully falls in love with a 3rd grade wimp, and the head of the class falls for Eddie. Eddie has to stop all this by concoting an anti-love potion. I would give this book probably a 2 or 3. It was good for people who are in 3rd grade, and maybe fourth, but I thought it was a little immature."
2,Unfortunate,"I thought her earlier efforts were superb, heralding a phenomenal new singer.This one is a formulaic repeat and is heavy on standards which have been done to death by the greatest singers of all time. What can she contribute to ""Summer Wind"" after Sinatra? ""River"" -- the duet with k.d. Lang -- and her own composition are actually the standouts here. She does a phenomenal job also on Leonard Cohen songs. She should stick to those, her own compostions and Dylan. Most annoying are the orchestration and electric organ. The disk sounds like a cheap wedding."
3,Half the Perfect CD,"Let me start out by saying that I'm a big fan. Careless Love was one of the finest albums to be released in quite some time, and one of the most memorable. I was truly impressed, giving as evidence the fact that I probably listened to it twenty times in the first week of owning it. I soon sought out Dreamland and enjoyed it as well, though some of the arrangements were a little too creative and ambitious. Which brings me to Half the Perfect World. I totally agree with Olukayode Balogun's assessment - perfectly put. I'll only add that one gets the sense that Ms. Peyroux's comfort level with the material this time around was anything but. There are times when she shines, as on the wonderfully crafted Once in A While, but overall, she sounds unsure of herself and what she's trying to achieve. Let's hope Ms. Peyroux finds her center again on the next effort and returns to what she does best. Kudos, however, to the flawless arrangements and production of Mr. Kein and company."
5,Michelle Peyroux Half The Perfect World,"This cd is delightfully lyrical with songs I enjoy even while reading. Not too intrusive, the music lingers, however, in one's memory. I have played it frequently, sometimes listening to the lyrics and other times, reading.. I heard Ms. Peyroux while shopping in a local health food store. Asked the sales person who the singer was and then I ordered it from Amazon. End of story. Anna Seidler...."
5,Worth The Wait,"Ever since Careless Love was released I have been looking forward to another CD from Madeleine. And this one almost matches the last - maybe I am not quite as excited because I didn't experience the ""wow"" factor that I did with Careless Love - when her sound was brand new to me. I think the best cuts are the 4 that Madeleine co-wrote with others, and I really wish her next CD would be all her own creations. Thank you, Madeleine."
3,New Peyroux,"I remain devoted to her previous album, Careless Love. This new effort is okay, but so slavishly faithful to that Peyrouvian sound that at the start of each of the first two songs I literally had to go back and check to be sure I wasn't listening to the first album. It varies somewhat after that, although you sure couldn't accuse it of taking any chances."
5,Jazzy cool and smooth - Madeileine Peyroux delivers!,The voice is especially pleasing. The lyrical ascendency is captured by her unique phrasing and inflection. A true original and an instant standard and classic performer.
1,I Needed To See An Ear Doctor.,"After listening to this songs off of this CD,my ears started to bleed.This is a bunch of screaming,light speed drums,and distorted guitars.You can't even figure out a word that the man is saying.Do not listen to this CD.It will make your ears bleed.Peace Out."
4,More of the same.... but that's a good thing.,"Red Harvest were spawned in Norway. Even without that piece of information it's easy to make a rough guess of their geographical location. You can't make this kind of music in Hawaii. Red Harvest are cold, harsh, and grating, the kind of music you expect to hear in a Terminator movie. Closest comparison would be early(ish) Fear Factory. But unlike Fear Factory, Red Harvest aren't the least bit interested in sounding melodic, instead sticking to their (machine) guns with statacco beats, disembodied vocals and paint-peeling guitars. They can occasionally be accused of being of losing the script and getting trapped in their own repetetiveness, but at their best their sound is bleak and terrifying, everything you want in 'cyber-metal' music."
3,Contains Many Traditional Foods,This book has a wealth of good information on Vietnamese cooking. The recipies are relatively easy to follow. The one thing that I would criticize is that it lacks photographs.
3,Comfortable but already wearing,I like the style of these briefs. I am short so the leg length of these is perfect for me. I have notice thought that the elastic in the leg holes is already starting to wear out. The legs are roll up and ride up in pants and shorts. Overall I am pleased.
1,very short,Very shortvery shortThe boxer is too short and uncomfortable.I prefer a little longer than not get on my buttocks. I'd rather not.My husband would use them
4,worth buying,"There is not a lot of advanced literature available for rabbits....so I would say this is a must-have for a first-time rabbit owner.For the experienced rabbit owner, I would stay it's still worth having. I am an experienced rabbit owner, and I still refer to this book time to time for baseline info. I still always see a rabbit specialized vet. I'm also wary of some of the homeopathic guidance it gives; I've read literature to the contrary of some of the author's advice on herbal remedies."
2,Very Disappointed!,"We received this overnight, and we are always pleased with Amazon's service. The bike however was a total diappointment. It was also defective/broken. The back wheel was totally bent and would not allow the bike to move forward. Good thing Amazon has an awesome return policy for Prime Members!I should have listened to the reviews that said:1) The bike is very heavy and hard to push along. Its a good bike for an older 5 or 6 year old, but not a great idea for a 4 year old. Our son is big and rides well, and its STILL very heavy and hard to maneuver.2) Its not worth the extra $50 or so that I spent on it. It looks cool, but is not of very high quality.Also, we received it damaged.Bummer. Best to go to a store and find a bike that fits your youngster!"
2,"Sconce is WHITE, not black as pictured.","Nothing annoys me more than a wrong photo. While the product title DOES say white, I did not see this and I purchased this product based on the ONE photo they listed which is clearly black and not white."
4,Fatal Embrace,Fatal Embrace....I found the story interesting. It held my interest to the end. I didn't anticipate that the killer would be who it was.
3,Islands of Desolation,"This book coupled with viewing the photos on this website, http://ile.kerguelen.free.fr/accueil.htm, paint a tale of how lonely a place can be. I have not seen many books on the Kerguelen and this book just whetted my interest in reading more about this place. If there had been more illustrations and maps I would have added another star."
4,Very Nice Hiking Boots,I am very happy with these hiking boots. They are very stylish and comfortable at the same time. The pine cone design and lavender accents are cute. They give great support and will be very functional on the trails. The price is very reasonable as well.
5,Bipartisan Historical Pictorial Dog Book,"""Name That Dog"" is a bipartisan dog book [coffee table size] that showcases your favorite presidents, whether Democrat or Republican, with their canine companions. This book is replete with historical photographs [black & white] dating back to Rutherford B. Hayes [1897] with his favorite spaniel, ""Dot."" Also included are celebrity dogs [Bob Hope with ""My dog"", Joan Rivers with ""Spike,"" Phyliss Diller with ""Phearless""] and many others ...If you like dogs and history, this book makes a great gift item!"
3,"Nice Bag, But Don't Recommend Since Doesn't Zip","This is a nice quality bag, and is just big enough to hold my D80, one lens and external flash. BUT, the bag does not zip which allows dust to get it in, so can't recommend it.Gave this away after a year and replaced with the Lowepro SlingShot 200 which zips and is much easier to access your camera when walking."
3,Not all that impressive,"I like this book, but felt it left out so many interesting cases.Most of the entries were not sordid or bizarre as the cover states but simply sad."
3,Book of Death For Dummies... ...,"I found this book to be written in a very basic, generic writingstyle. Much better books have been written on this subject in amuch more interesting way. No new information here I have'nt read elsewhere. This book should have been titled ""HollywoodBook of Death For Dummies"" or something. I highly recommend thisbook for the Hollywood graveyard beginner. Enjoy."
2,Not as Bizarre and Sordid as it claims,"The Hollywood Book of Death is heavily padded with excruciating background that seems lifted from allmovie.com. Strangely, many of the dead actor&#65533;s best work or more interesting aspects of their life are left out. Author James Robert Parish slummed writing this book. Half the book is dedicated to death by natural causes (yawn), while the Murdered, Drugs, Accidents and Suicide sections are stunningly short. I could name another dozen actors to add to each of those categories.Hollywood Book of Death is okay if you are a novice to such trivia."
4,Very entertaining,"This was a good read. It was published in 2002 so it has some very recent stories, not just the old recycled stories we've all heard before, like Dean, Presley, and Monroe. Absent from this book are Margaux Hemingway, Frances Farmer, Robert Reed, and Jackie Gleason. But overall, I was entertained and liked reading about everyone."
4,Hollywood Book of Death,"I wanted to know more and now I do. I find myself quoting parts of this book to my friends and family. Like "" Did you know that so and so or he/she died...."" I don't know if they think I am interesting but at least I now have more to talk about. I have read several Parish Hollywood books and they tend to repeat the same subject matter and deal with some stars I've never heard of but all in all it's an enjoyable and easy read."
1,Bugs Galore,"Game slows down on all computers, unplayable. I have a 2.8 P4, radeon ATI 9800, 512M ram but I get 2 Frames per second in the games night time mode. Check the roller coaster tycoon website forums on Ataris own webpage. No patch, how can they release a product that is so buggy. Last time I buy a game without doing my research. Can I give this 0 stars?"
1,Couldn't load RCT3,"My husband and son spent almost 24 hours trying to load and run RCT3. We let our son open it as an early Christmas gift, and what a let down! We have 3 computers, all of which are Windows XP, and NONE of them could run this! My husband and I are both software engineers, and are very used to computer and software loading issues, so you can imagine our dismay with the fact that we couldn't get this to run on ANY of our computers! We finally just let him download RCT2 from the internet ($15 on top of the $20 we paid for the CD-ROM Gold package on Amazon) and RCT2 is running fine.I vote for downloading the software vs. buying the CD-ROM package. I'll never make this mistake again!"
1,HORRIBLE TOY !,Hi i think this toy is horrible because i hate barbie so much but my friend Esther loves her so much.I think barbie is a rotten thing.It is a peice of junk.
4,Barbie and the Princess Doll,"Good gift, great value... Any girl would love to receive it (any age ;-) )"
2,Not meeting.,"The dialog of this movie is a great idea, but why does the brunette have to be the poor servant? But the blonde always knows she's rich, but they just look exactly alike but with different hair color."
2,It had a lot of promise...,"Don't get me wrong. This book had a very good and original premise that could have had a great story made out of it. However, the writing in it is (in my opinion) pretty weak. Besides some fairly interesting history behind it, there is not much else. Also, a lot of the characters seemed pretty one-sided, but I can imagine that's hard to avoid in writing a relatively short story such as this."
1,awful,I can only give a review of the first 30 pages of the book because I couldn't bare reading the rest. Greg Bear is an incredibly incompetent writer. I can't believe he can actually make a living writing his garbage. His writing is filled with grammatical errors that would embarrass a high school student and is peppered with nonsensical technobabble that makes reading the book a frustrating and tedious chore. Stay away from this book. You'd be better off reading a comic book.
5,FIVE STARS SAYS IT ALL,THERE SHOULD BE NO REQUIREMENT ON WORDS. tHIS IS VOLUNTARY AND TIME CONSUMING - IF I DIDN'T ADMIRE dAVE SO MUCH i WOULDN'T EVEN DO IT.
3,shampoo,The wrapper needed to have been more creatively designed considering the cost and purpose of the product.Cooperative seller.
4,trek fans will enjoy,"I personally like this collection, although I couldn't bring myself to give it a 5 based on a questionable episode choice or two (considering the theme at least, not that they are bad episodes), the repeat of an episode from a previous ""collective,"" and because of the fact it just simply isn't as good as some of the other collectives (specifically the borg collective, and arguably others as well).But maybe I am just being picky, as I do not regret my purchase at all, and do enjoy the captain interviews as well as the episodes. If you are like me and love trek but can't bring yourself to purchase all the full seasons, these collectives are worth the money, and this one is no exception."
4,Great collection of Star Trek shows,"This collection highlights what the fans have picked to be the best shows showcasing each captain. For the most part, this is a good collection. The only thing I found a bit burdensome was how long the introductions are for those with a commentary by the actors. Joan Collins and William Shatner talk about ""The City on the Edge of Forever"" for what seems like an eternity before showing the episode. Most introductions are brief and to the point, but some go on. Those could have been trimmed down. Otherwise, all these episodes are great. If you are a Star Trek fan, this collection is a worthwhile investment."
2,disappointing,"I just have to say a very disappointing boxset.TNG for instance. Easily should have been Inner light, the mission to farpoint, and Best of Both worlds.DS9 another one that scratched my head on. Far beyond the stars? Pretty much anything in season 5 or 6 should have been in there. Also even the last eps IMO was very weak. Thought Visitor should have been in there.Voyager wasn't that great either. Both the omega directive and flashpoint were okay eps but, nowhere near the best. Definately think the eps called tuvix was far better and also the eps called friendly one when they find a probe earth sent that had destroyed a civilization.Finally the worst of all was enterprise.. How in the world did these are the voyages make it. I liked the episode but, no way it was one of the best. Easily in a mirror darkly, twilight and pretty much anything in season 3 should have been in there."
5,Great,"I don't really know how to classify ""Houseloop"" but don't be fooled by the title. Even though its classied as House, this isnt a mix with weak, House music on it. The beats are strong, and the bass lines are excellent. Time has been good to this CD, even though its been 10yrs since its release. Frankie has been one of my favorites in the early years of electronica, not only as a DJ, but has put together some pretty good songs as well. If you are a fan of Electronica, be sure to put this one in your collection..ENJOY"
3,Bike Review,"I bought this bike off a review. And it was true that the bike was easy to put together, but when it arrived there were three big gaping holes in the box and it turned out the front brake was broken. So, I had to pay an additional fee to a bike shop to fix.So, the bike works great now and my daughter loves it, but the delivery of it was horrible."
4,Classic sitcom.,My son asked for this. Several of his friends also enjoy Hogan's Heroes. The series seems to be enjoying a resurgence among young teens.
4,worth the wait,"Due to the shippers location(australia) and the location of product manufacturing(china), the delay is extremely long from order date to delivery date. The product though is good. I would say that I would recommend this product."
5,Hogan's Hero's,This was one of my husbands favorite TV series. It has been fun watching the series and they just make us laugh! Who doesn't need to laugh these days? We have been really pleased with our purchase.
5,Big enough for a mid sized projector and document camera (elmo),"Perfect for my use in courtroom presentations. Table is easy to set up and take down and convenient to carry around and store. Table was large enough to hold my projector and ELMO document camera. Plan to order optional shelf to hold laptop as well. Good quality, sturdy, definitely recommended."
3,pretty good,"item is made flimsy: bearings a ring fall off. I did get it together again and put in place on a corner cabinet shelf and it spins easily and quietly. It is taller than expected, so one loses storage space for the convenience of reaching items in the back. I'm past time when I could return this because I went on a long vacation a couple of days after installing, otherwise I would do just that.But, these large lazy Susans are hard to find, so I did appreciate that it is available for a moderate price."
5,"21"" Lazy Susan Spin Tray","This product is high quality, glides easily when it turns, and solved my problem for having to search through the many kitchen pantry products to reach the one I needed. Even when weighted down with canned or heavier items, it still glides smoothly."
3,Works great once fix assembly errors,"On unpacking the ball bearings for this lazy susan were loose and it would not spin. Had to seperate pieces and reinstall the bearings in their plastic ring. But even when reinstalled it dod not work properly. So I took it apart again and flipped over the ball bearing plastic ring. Now it works great. Since others reported problems with the ball bearings, I believe the manufacture has poor quality control and assembled the lazy susan incorrectly."
1,Save your money...,"This pamphlet contains no information that can't be obtained for free via a Google search, and is overpriced at any price. I found ""Bwana Dik's Guide to Rio"" on the web, and it contains 50 times the info contained in the ""Single Man's Pocket Guide to Rio de Janeiro."" And this free web guide even includes it's own pocket guide."
5,My Hero is Chris Novack,"Chris Novack has inspired me as a hired professional consultant and a friend. After working with Chris on several occasions, he has assisted my career's development and advancement each and every time.My wonderful and valuable relationship with Chris was focused primarily, on a professional level - however, my strong desire to read his book became the impetus to learn what made him so extraordinary. Never in my life, could I imagine how I would benefit so greatly from Chris' story ...now on a personal level, I feel blessed to have been a part of his life...a part of ""his story"".I have already applied Chris' teachings (realizing tremendous success) within both, my personal life and career.No words can describe how powerful a message he delivers, but for those who embrace his teachings...will truly benefit!Simply stated, Chris Novack is my hero.I strongly encourage you and your organizations to not only ready this book, but practice it's fundamentals DAILY."
5,The Best of the Series,"Pro Wrestling Hall of Fame Vol. 3 is definitely the best of the series. It shows how dominant Hulk Hogan was from the mid-80s to the early-90s. It also gives a better indication on how much of a better champion Hogan was compared to Flair when you watch the videos.The matches are also fairly quick, since Hogan normally ends his matches within ten minutes. While some of the Flair matches were long, slow, and boring.In the first two videos that featured Flair, he practically lost all of the matches. While in this video, we see Hulk Hogan rampaging through all of his opponents.The people who produced all three volumes seem to have more respect for Hogan, even though two of the three tapes are dedicated to Ric Flair."
3,(Drink On Me) Teule,This album has a nice blend of house music tracks that can keep you blazing the dance floor for hours. The Best track on this album is Drink On me by Teule. This song was a hit in the clubs when it was first released and is in rotation in the clubs today!
4,Inspiring for the entrepreneurial spirit,"After reading Jeffery Rosenweig's inspiring book, I wanted to go home and begin working on a proposal for my new international company-now I just need a product or service, any ideas? Seriously, I think this book is a must-read for anyone expanding his or her business in the international arena. Being a natural poster boy for ADHD, the first section of his book was difficult for me to get through with all of the demographic data, population charts, etc. The second part of the book focuses more on his strategy for making things happen--really cool. I especially like the chapter on the future skills needed for the successful executive-very inspiring. Where I think Jeff misses the mark a little is on a strategy for dealing with people in all of this; i.e. local populations, cultures, governments, etc. He is an economist and not a social scientist so this is understood. I read this book on recent trip to Japan so it is not difficult to get through. Enjoy!"
2,non stick surface bubling after a few months,"We boought it a few months ago. It gives us steaks of the same quality as if you go to a steak house.Unfortunately, after a few montths, around 20 uses, the non stick surface started to get coarse / rough at a few places. We thought it was food / fat left over. But the surface gets more and more damaged after a few more uses. At that price and with the qualty they advertised, it should last longer than a cheap brand"
5,Breville 800 GRXL Indoor Barbeque and Grill,"FANTASTIC!!!! I enjoy Gourmet cooking and like to have the best equipment available to cook with. I have a ""GEORGE FOREMAN"" grill and it does NOT even come close to the 800 GRXL in any way. I find that the 800 GRXL Grill has met and exceeded all of my desires and expectations for an Indoor Grill. The temperature control and the ""Tilt"" bottom grill plate is most helpful, The Grill heats fast and evenly, the adjustable top grill allows for a diversity in grilling and is outstanding for cooking Bacon and pressing Sandwiches i.e. Po' Boys, grilled cheese and more.The capability of using both sides of the grill when it is fully opened allows for frying or grilling at the same time reducing food preparation time. The grill is extremely easy to clean and can be stored after use in a small space by standing it on end.This superb grill is highly recommended and every kitchen should have one."
2,problem with non-stick surface bubbling: sooo sad!,"I love this grill. Yes, it's big, but for a family of four that's good. Problem? The non-stick surface is beginning to bubble after only 9 months of light use. At first, I thought it was just food left on the grill, but, alas, it is the surface coming away. It might be possible to make the grill last another year or so, if one were careful, but I don't think this should happen so soon. I don't think I have used it more than 25 times. I have sent an email to Breville asking for information on returns/repairs. I'll update this post after they respond (assuming they do).UPDATE:I contacted Breville via email, and they promptly replied with information on how to send it back. Assuming they concur with my assessment of the bubbling problem, I should receive a replacement. Can't ask for better customer service than that! A+"
3,"A readable overview, but dated","This is a decent, readable overview for the beginner to the Byzantine Empire, and the edition I have of this book is nicely illustrated, with many black and white photographs. However, the constant references to the allegedly inferior ""Asian"" and ""oriental"" aspects of Byzantine culture are infuriating and make this book more dated than one would think, given the fact that it was published in 1977. Pictures asides, I would recommend John Julius Norwich over this."
3,"Great Value,","This DVD was a great value, giving you 3 different movies on 1 disc. Video quality could have been alot better."
5,Go in well and block out noise,"I like the fact that you can control how much of the earplug you want in your ear. Blocks out a wide range of noises - used these at air shows, gun ranges, etc. Washable too"
4,"Soft, comfortable, effective.",These are the softest earplugs I have tried. They are easy to insert and remove and so comfortable I forget that they're there. My only niggle is that the central stalks that allow you to remove them easily are just a little too long for my ears - they protrude just far enough that I can't put anything on top of them - not that I've wanted to so far.They seem to keep the water out very effectively too. I use them with my Swimp3 waterproof player while swimming so that the noise of the bubbles doesn't drown out the music. Very effective combination - and much more comfortable (and effective) than the earbuds of another (more conventional) waterproof player that I own.
5,Best Ear Plug,"I need to plug both of my ears when I swim and these are the absolute BEST. I don't get any water in my ears at all. I have tried other ear plugs, including the aqua block of this same brand, and they just do not compare. These ear plugs are amazing! They are hard to find, but worth it once you find them."
1,Poor Content,"The information provided in this DVD series is very limited and in some cases wrong! What is provided is very basic. Anyone who has taken astronemy classes or watched another similar TV series (such as Carl Sagan's) will learn nothing new. Very broad and inacurate assumptions are made without sufficient effort to gratify them (for example a black hole may devourer our solar system). Little factual information is presented to provide a clear picture.I did not find the series entertaining, even with the decent CGI effects. I do not recommend this for anyone with a fair knowledge of astronemy."
2,you GET WHAT U PAID 4!!!!!!!,"FIRST: this dryer only has the heat vents in a small circle on the top(inside the hood)SECONDLY: if you have long hair in rollers (i do) the hair on top of your head will dry quickly but you have to wait for the back so you will damage the over expose hair on top while waiting for the rest of hair to dry.THIRD: dryer only has low and hi ...low is extremely low and hi is very very hot!! if you have long hair, use rollers, or u r concerned about keeping hair healthy and exposed to as little heat as possible this is not for you! IF you have short hair, you will love it.Also after 5 minutes my ears feel like they are on fire. whatever happen to the good dryers made years ago? well i guess i got what i paid for ...this was cheap!"
1,1875 Ionic Hard Bonnet Dryer,"This Vidal Sasson Bonnet Dryer does not give our much heat or air, so it is useless. I have to return it even though I will not get back much after shipping charges. A better buy would be the Conair HH 400. I bought both.The Conair HH400 gives out more heat and air which is needed to activate my non-oxidant hair color."
3,Works well but very fragile!,"This dryer does a great job - dries hair quickly, but it's difficult to dry long hair unless it is piled on top of your head. The hat is very roomy. The major downside of this dryer is that it is very fragile. The handle and top of the dryer cracked easily when our 6 year-old put pressure on it to lift herself up."
1,Not Delivered,This is a short review because I have not received an issue yet. It looks like my wait has been shorter than many but 3 months and counting? Come on. Amazon find a vendor that can deliver and in the meantime give me my money back.
2,Made in China,"I have had so many poor experiences with cheap products from China that I try hard to find things made in USA. In the past, the DeWalt name has generally been one I could depend on but now, it's beginning to mean ""made in China."" These nails are no exception. They are Chinese. They may be OK but I'm suspicious of the quality of the metal and plan to look elsewhere for future nail purchases."
2,"I think, therefore I am Siri Hustvedt","This is one insecure writer. In her new book Living, Thinking, Looking, which I'm not yet able to review, she talks about simple answers to badly asked questions, and I'm afraid that's very largely what she's in the business of providing (certainly, in the latter case). She worries away at the self as if it were anything more than a hill o' beans, an illusion like the Dubya brand of freedom. No doubt a hundred years ago, when it was permissable, usual and even laudable to be a buttoned-up doormat, Hustvedt would have fit right in. Are all Minnesota Scandinavians so straitlaced? Somewhere deep underneath I hear the rumble of rage. Let out them stays, siss!"
1,complaint,"I never got a chance to use my juicer because the juicing cone was missing. I contacted the seller and requested they send me the missing part however they said that was not an option, that I needed to return the juicer and they would email me a prepaid return label within 24/48 hours...that never happened. Now the vendor has instructed me to ship it @ my expense and they will issue me a credit for the shipping. Bottom line I am not very happy...who needs all this hassle with something that should have been simple to rectify."
5,Awesome juicer!,"I have been using a cheap $8 juicer that I got on closeout over 15 years ago. It worked okay but was really wearing out. After deciding to replace it I originally purchased another juicer. However, when it arrived, it was hard to used and really not as good as my old one. When I called to return it the operator recommeded the Breville saying that they never had any complaints about them. I am so glad that I took her advice. The Breville is the most amazing juicer ever and worth every penny. It is sturdy as well as an attractive addition to my countertop. Our family has eight children from 2-18 and from the first day they have all been using it to make lemonade, grapefruit, and orange juice. The best part is that it is so easy to use and clean is that they can do it themselves. The only negative is that I am going broke on all of the citrus I am buying for them!"
2,Life expectancy of this juicer,"I loved this juicer when I got it 3-4 years ago, BUT ... the elbow of the arm keeps getting stuck, to the point where my husband no longer thinks he can repair it, and on top of that it no longer runs at all. For the price, I expected it to live a lot longer."
2,Breville Citrus Press CPXL doesn't last,"I purchased this Citrus Press about a year ago and LOVED it. We felt it was an expensive purchase compared with other products on the market, but thought if we bought the best it would last. I am sorry to say that it didn't last. The internal gears are plastic and have worn out. The replacement gears are not expensive, but there is the hassle factor of having to take the whole thing apart to get to the gears. But, the big stinger is that the parts are not available for another four months! I assume this huge backorder/delay is due to the fact that everyone is having the same problem.We loved this juicer and enjoyed fresh orange juice every morning - fresh lemon juice during the summer. I write this review now as a warning about the internal gears. So if you buy it, don't expect it to last.I have notified the company. So hopefully, their QC department will fix it in the future.Susan BrownOklahoma"
2,"when it works, it's great","Just received my juicer today. After juicing about 20 lemons, nothing. Let it sit for about half hour, then worked again. Juiced another 15 lemons, then nothing again. I don't think they should call this ""industrial strength"". It appears the motor can handle only so much, then has to rest for a while. Think twice if you juice more than a few pieces of fruit at a time...follow up: continues to do the same bizarre stopping and starting after 2 weeks - sent it back. i have a $10.00 toastmaster brand juicer that is easily as efficient (though not as pretty) and certainly more reliable."
1,The plastic grear broke down within 2 weeks,"This is the best juicer as long as it works. For $200, one would expect it to last for years. Mine broke down with in 2 weeks. The plastic gear (the plastic part on which you mount the metal dome/cone) started to show cracks and the dome would get stuck on it. So after juicing, you'll have to put a lot of force to remove the dome for cleaning. Do a google search for ""breville citrus press plastic gear"" and you'll know what I mean. This is a common complaint from its users."
2,I TRIED to like this device... :-(,"I purchased the Breville Citrus Press less than a month ago and have really TRIED to like this machine; based on the majority of positive reviews on it. It does extract the juice very well, BUT there's just one part of this device, that has me sending back to Amazon. The top spindle or cover that clamps down on the citrus, is a real pain to get in and out. You have to basically force that part to snap back into the handle. Having to do that EVERY TIME you remove it to clean the machine is just a pain and I'm concerned that after repeated forcibly snapping in episodes, it won't engage or lock after a while. Cleaning all the different parts is kind of a pain as well. I'm going to go for one of the cheap O $20.00 juice pressers instead... TGFA (Thank God For Amazon), allowing me to send this item back."
2,Motor cuts out,"I bought a Breville Citrus Press a month ago. After juicing about 10 oranges over a period of 3 days, the motor cut out. I could hear something engage, but the motor would not turn the juicing cone. I returned it for another one. This one works much better. But it is the end of orange juice season for me, and I'm juicing a lot of oranges at one time for freezing. The motor has cut out on me twice after juicing about 25 - 30 oranges. That thermal overload protection they mention in the manual seems to kick in relatively early, and then you're done juicing for about an hour. I actually had to go back to my Black and Decker to finish the oranges I had cut up. For $200, I would think it should be able to juice a lot more oranges at one time. Other than that, it juices very well."
4,800CPXL -- so far it lives up to the reviews,"We've had the 800CPXL citrus juicer for about 1wk. So far we've juiced between 50-100 oranges, tangelo & tangerines. So far, it lives up to the reviews. The unit seems solid. It is easy to use, easy to clean, quiet, well balanced (doesn't tip or walk) and has eye-appeal (as far as appliances go). In the short time we've had it, we've juiced fruit that range from 2inches to 4 or 5in diameter. Regardless of size, they all get reamed completely. The machine is surprisingly quiet (not silent -- but quiet). I've juiced while carrying on a normal conversation. We have children as young as 7yr. They've all used the juicer (not the knife) and keep asking when they can juice some more. We have 7 small citrus trees, so this baby is going to get used. The only reason I didn't give it 5stars is the cost. The proof of whether it is worth the $$ won't come for years (we expect this juicer to last a long time)."
3,"Nothing Great, but SOmething to See to Say You Saw it.","This film was supposed to be based on a true story although it is a remake with a different story than the original! I doubt most of the stunts in this film took place in real life. This film is the typical, 'trained' killers who are so well trained that they appear almost like super heroes with their fighting skills! We all know that they can only go as far as their weapons tkae them. This films is nothing to get excited about. What I really dislike about the hilm is the leader of Oman. Aside from having the wrong turban on, the Omani leader looked very weird. He did not look like a natural man."
3,Average at best,"This movie didn;t do a thing for me, The ending left me saying"" that was it??!!"" Jason Statham was the only reason I wanted to watch this movie, but he was not enough to make this movie worth the 2 hours I spent watching it. All in all-- a very average movie that I could have done without."
3,Performance and choice of movie,Not what I have come to expect from Jason. He normally leaves me wanting to come back for more. I have watched this twice and still don't have that feel good felling I usually get from his movies.
2,Killer Elite,"Ehhh.... What is it that makes a good film? Good actors? Well this one has a few, can't blame them, we know they can do good work, under the right circumstances. A big budget? $70,000,000, that should be enough. Who do we blame? The director? It's his first feature! Well maybe that has something to do with it. I know I couldn't have done better, but the question remains .....what makes a good film? I still don't know how to put my finger on it. Perhaps if you just give the audience a little credit. We want to buy into the story and get lost, but we need a little more then what this film offers.... at least I do. I wanted to like it, but in the back of my mind I keep hearing a voice that was saying ""this is is stupid""."
3,I speak cliche,A bit of inventiveness in the action but the dialog is mostly just a series of cliches. It would have been nice if the dialog had been as good as the action.
1,So bad it's...bad,Incoherent in an intereting way. Unfortunately deniro is one of the worst action actors in American history. Watching him run with a gun is like watching a man run t the toilet with the runs. Awful
5,Acid Resistant 2: A one-of-a-kind techno CD,"Acid Resistant 2 should have a spot on any techno fan's shelf. This great collection of virtually impossible to find 303 tunes is unmatched. DJ DB's presence adds to the overall flavor, with some great mix effects between songs. This album is worth every cent - you can't get this stuff anywhere else!"
2,Pretty lame,I'd forgotten how bad this movie was. The writing is terrible. Even Paul Newman can't save it from its self.
2,Really dated,"Medeocre movie with disappointingly little about racing. Good acting within the limitations of the budget and direction. Usually sold with Grand Prix and Le Mans, both far better racing movies."
4,Great Movie,Racing is just the back drop for a great movie on the what is important in life. Winning is great but fleeting. Our relationships with others are our connections to other lives and to ourselves and this movie with some great actors brings meaning to what winning really means. It's not about winning the next race which is why Frank does not go to Michigan at the end.
4,great cd,Akinyeles new cd keeps up with the same type of sick rap. Do you Wanna is by far the best song so if you like that get the cd. the cd hits pretty hard so if you wanna bump a system definetly get this cd. its vulgar but hilarious so buy it.
3,"Too much personal story, not enough proof","I was hoping there would be documented cases within this book but there are not. All Keonig talks about is ""many cases"", ""various cases"" and ""multiple studies"" which makes his assertions somewhat dubious.I was hoping for some; ""In 1994, at Harvard Medical school, 345 patients...."" type stuff. I didn't find it.If you want a light/feel good read this is it.If you want facts and figures look elsewhere."
2,They might be OK if they did not come damaged,"Well on my way to customer service, they shipped these in a big box with other things and no cushioning except the air bags, and nails love airbags. This is not the first ime this has happened, and could be prevented just by taping the box."
4,"Zooming and trippy, really a single-track CD","Nice integration of vocalist samples and synthy wooshes and beats. Lot's of playing around and bending a sample, with climactic peaks and fuzzy chill-downs. I can listen to the whole thing without realizing it's done. There is not much variation in style between tracks so it may be boring for some, but if the sound clicks for you then you won't be complaining."
3,Mediocre Mono Sound,"As others have noted, the main choice here is between Janis Paige and Doris Day. Doris Day has the better voice but the Broadway CD has better sound,and added songs. Take your pick. I recall the LP version of this soundtrack being in Stereo so it was disappointing indeed to hear that the tracks here are in Mono, and not all that well recorded even for the time. Checking the movie online it says mono soundtrack so maybe it was never recorded in stereo. On the other hand, WB's other film from the same composers, Damn Yankees was recorded in stereo, 1958, but not so released until the CD version came out, so if there is a stereo version of the soundtrack it would be nice if they would release it."
2,Not for me,"You can judge this book by its cover. The most inspiring ideas are pictured on the cover. I didn't find a lot of helpful tips in the book either. If you aren't planning on decorating a cookie in the exact same taste and detail level as those pictured, try another book. I also purchased Cookie Craft by Valerie Peterson and really enjoyed it. I would strongly recommend that book for a new decorator, more tips and less dependence on intricate piping work."
2,Disappointing,"Started promising, but quickly declined into to utterly unbelievable action sequences with no basis in reality. I tried my best to suspend disbelief for sake of the story, but it was just not worth the outcome. The heroine was so strange and conflicted that she actually became an annoying distraction. The `hero' was anything but. By the time the book was in the last pages I felt I was reading an anti Arab propaganda pamphlet. All that could have been forgiven had the novel not gone off on such unrealistic tactical and dramatic flights of fancy. It became a cartoon by the end. The author had written much better novels since this effort."
5,"Fun, exciting, written a while ago, but still timely....","I loved this book and it would make a great movie....Demille hits another home run....This is one of his earlier books, but doesn't miss a beat....The story could happen today....."
2,Not the Typical DeMille,I am a huge DeMille fan but was disappointed with By The Rivers of Babylon. The story line was great but was overshadowed by John Carey's crude wise cracks. In his previous books I have enjoyed the John Carey character however it seems that DeMille when out of his way to make him more of a wise ass in this book and it got tiring very early in the book. I felt he could have taken 200 pages of wise cracks out of this book and then he would have had a great read.
2,One of De Mille's two weakest efforts,"I absolutely LOVE Nelson De Mille and have read everything he has written, frequently several times. However, this book (and Mayday, which is offered as a special along with Cathedral and Charm School) are his two least interesting efforts. In my view, by a wide margin. De Mille's brilliant development of characters is nowhere in evidence in the book. Frankly, I found it to be both tedious and implausible. If you are a die hard De Mille fan, then I guess that you should go ahead and get this book to round out your familiarity with his catalog. But please don't make this the first book of his that you buy, because you might be dissuaded from buying his other titles. And that would be a crime. Start with Gold Coast or Plum Island, two of his absolute best, to get a true feel for what De Mille is capable of when he's at the top of his game."
3,Not as good as his other stuff,"Usually Nelson's books are fast paced and riviting, but this one not so much. I found myself skimming a lot of it, as the descriptions of dead cities was just overdone. It was an ok read but I would recommend some of his other stuff first."
2,Looks great but basic functionality is poor,"This mouse has the looks and all features but it's concept is not very useful. I am a loyal logitech customer but this mouse really disappointed me. This is my first wireless mouse and it made me change my mind about ever buying another one. The media buttons work well but a range of around 10 feet is way too short, it's easier to click on the pause and play. The worst part is the constant cursor jumping/skipping, still not sure if it's because it's wireless or it's a bad optical sensor. I don't deal with graphics software so it doesnt have to be extremely precise but the precision of this mouse is unacceptable even for the basic everyday applications. Would not recommend this mouse to anyone, should've returned it right away.ProsPlug and play on most computersMedia buttonsPretty good battery lifeConsDoesn't work on many surfacesCursor jumps around when you move it(most annoying shortcoming)Too heavy with the 2 batteries, your hand gets tired quickly"
3,Lemon...,"Sadly it seems I got a lemon - and from the reviews I've read, this is not at all unusual with this mouse!The media buttons work well, although they're not ideally placed. I really like the general ergonomics, but I have fairly large hands, like palm a basketball large.On the down side, clicking my scroll wheel had no effect. Zoom didn't work, assigning another task didn't work, which means I can't send it to universal scroll and tab browse in firefox unless I want to adulterate my media functions. I'm returning it - and debating whether or not to get another since it seems like 25% of the reviews report problems.A second razer diamondback might be the better option - and definitely has a better probability of reaching me in working condition..."
2,Not for Lefties,"I'm sure this mouse would be great if you are right-handed, but not for lefties. For one, the mouse does not support left-handed capabilities. You can't even swap the click buttons. Left-handed people should stay away from this mouse. Is it too much to ask for mice that support left-handers and have some extra buttons like the right-handers have?"
3,Mono - Recording of Galli-Curci,"Too bad they didn't remaster this - I heard Amelita Galli-Curci on 78s, the voice came through the scratchiness of the recording techniques of the day. It would be nice to hear something sharper with surface noises removed - still one has to love that facile voice. Galli-Curci ""queen of coloraturas"" the first of the golden age sopranos to become a millionaire!"
5,Training the Mike Mentzer way,I wish I could have read this book 15 years ago when I first began bodybuilding. I have seen excellent results in a very short amount of time. Speaking of time; I am spending way less of it in the gym and getting great results!
2,Not as advertised,"Advertised as having a coaster brake, not.Advertised as having a 6 speed, not, has a 5 speed.If I would have known this, I would have opted for something else."
4,Great educational book for us laymens.,"This is a wonderful book to read for anyone who enjoys science but doesn't have a science degree. This book explains questions many have pondered and it does it's best to give scientific explinations without making the reader feel as if he/she is inferrior to knowledge because they don't have a degree attached to their name. This book explains it in ways for everyone to understand, that I appreaciate."
4,It works!,The product has helped bring my blood pressuer down to the normal range. The buying experience was smooth and delievery on time.
2,Doesn't work with my MAC,"Although this product looks good and shipped on time, it doesn't work with my pre-unibody Macbook Pro. The problem is that the line-in port on a MAC works differently than a PC (you need a preamp or something). It's not a problem with the headphones, but a problem with the MAC. The only problem is they do not make this incompatibility clear on their product page.I'm not sure if this works with newer MACs or not, but I would get usb headphones instead just to be safe."
4,rather good,"it is good headset with nice audio quality and mic, long wire, well adjustable microphone , very simple, fast delivery about 5 days onlydisadvantages areit fits only for medium-sized head and the ear pad is oval that doesnt cover the ear well, no scroll for adjusting volume"
3,Not USB,"These headphones are the older plug-in type -- one plug each for the headphones and the microphone. They do not have a USB connection. This is fine most older computers, but it will not work on some netbooks, tablets, and newer machines that have only USB ports. It would be helpful to have this information in the basic specs for the product."
4,Works as intended!,"I have owned several of these headsets over the years... They work as intended. usually last me about a year, then I junk em and get another headset. For the money, cant expect a life-long partner... Its a disposable headset and priced accordingly, but do function nicely for MMO Gaming (Ventrilo, TeamSpeak, Mumble, etc), if your looking for LucasArts quality sound, probably not the headset for you, but if your a gamer looking for a ""raiding"" headset, cant go wrong with these cheapies... Just expect to have to buy another pair every year or so..."
5,more than I need,"they work just fine for what I use them for, I'm not a gamer but mic works good and no distortion from the speakers"
3,Had to return it?,The mike itself didn't work for us. We weren't sure it was the headset or something else. We didn't have another item to try it out. So Amazon was kind enough to let us return it. Nice size for portablity but a tad small for my husbands head but fit mine fine. We could hear through the ears fine but made no mike connection. We bought it to use with Skype & lap top system so needed that mike part to work too.
4,It works,I use this to chat with family and friends and listen to some music. I could be better but I would say it works good for the price.
3,New Headphones are ok,"I bought these after looking to replace an old broken pair for a reasonable price. I play video games and appreciate good sound and only use headphones after the kids go to bed, otherwise I use my 7.1 suround sound speaker system which is spectacular. These headphones work but the sound is far from spectacular. If you want headphones for high fidelity sound this is not the pair for you. These are good for a call center but that is about it. I'm also cheap so yes I could have paid a lot more but for the amount of time that I use headphones am unwilling to do so. Overall just ok."
4,Great for the price!,"The headphones arrived in quick order and were a great buy for the price. I upgraded from a previous pair of Cyber Acoustics headphones that I had for over a year, but finally wore out in the ear piece.The only con I would find with this new set is the padding for the ears is a little bit uncomfortable, the material is harder than on their other headphones so after about an hour my head starts to hurt."
3,"Good looking, but....","I am enrolled in a Rosetta Stone language class and needed headphones with a microphone for it. My school lent me a pair from the same company so I bought these online to use. They are very comfortable and they look cool but the microphone is terrible. Over half of Rosetta Stone is pronounciation, which I am very good with, but with these headphones I have to scream to get the program to catch what I am saying. I have to redo every lesson multiple times because of this and it is extremely frustrating. I would not purchase a new pair of these for this purpose. Other than the microphone though, the shipping was fast, they have good sound quality, and are quite comfortable. If you need them for precise speaking, don't buy these, but if you are using them for other uses they seem to be a good choice."
2,"Very poor quality construction, POOR RELIABILITY","I have gone through 2 of these in one year of daily use in an office environment. When the first one broke I thought it was just bad luck, so I bought a second one. IT BROKE EXACTLY THE SAME WAY! What happens is that the wires on the left side speaker are poorly constructed with poor isolation/insulation material, so eventually you get a short circuit of the wires as the chaffing inside the left-ear piece wears down the lacquer electrical insulator, creating a short circuit, which causes the left speaker to work intermittently, and eventually stops working completely. Then if you keep using it, eventually the right speaker wiring will also short. The company that makes these needs to redesign them with better quality materials, even if it costs a few dollars more. Stay away from this product until they redesign the wiring."
3,"Good Sound, Good Mic, but shorted out at 6 months","I am sad these were not more durable. The flexible mic is great, the sound was very good. But now sound only come into one side. I am not able to access where the short is to try and fix it myself.Maybe I'm asking too much for a pair of headphones that will last 1 year or more! Frustrating!!!Buy them if you don't mind buying ""disposable"" headphones that will need to be replaced soon."
5,Terrific Read-Seven Days,Seven Days is a page-turning thriller featuring a hero you can't wait to take home and a heroine who isn't a shrinking violet! I couldn't go to sleep until I finished reading this spellbinding intrigue.What a terrific read! You'll want to add this book to your collection.
2,too gory,i did not like this film. it was too gory. would not recommend this film. the music was good. i did nkot watch gladiator so can't say about that one
4,Great picture quality,"I ordered this for a ""Man Night"" me and my friend had. The picture quality totally enhances these movies. I espcially liked braveheart, (gladiator was a bit more mindless but more action).I fully reccomend this package but I have docked 1 star because the box it came in was a little bit bent in the corner so it was not in perfect condition."
2,There are better poker games out there,"I found this game on sale for half price, So I decided to try it. I love poker, and have played a few games on the PC (free games), and they are much better than this, I was expecting a little bit more from a wii game than this, you cant play over the net, The screen is cluttered, and I dont like the camera angles. Also some of the noises can get repetitive and anouying, like the sneezing. I love the wii but not this game. I will wait and see if Nintendo brings out a poker game with online play."
5,FANTASTIC!!,The Wii Remote is just terrific for this type of game. I mean I have played other poker games on other systems and have always found the conrols annoying. With the wii Remote however the controls are perfect and the gameplay is just as perfect...This is a great game for those that love to play poker...(and not lose any money..lol) while feeling as if they are ACTUALLY playing with a group of friends...Only bad thing is it woulda been great if it had been online...hopefully the next one will have online...
1,unsatisfied!,"i have a psp slim, the itrip willnot even plug into the slim. someone needs to change the discription to let people know that it won't fit any ""psp"" only the older larger ones. it was a waste of my money"
1,wont work past 6 months,I had this for a little more than 6 months and it completely stopped working. They don't even make this product anymore because it is so bad. It would go on and off 6 times or more within one song.This is the worse ever. Buyer beware!!!
3,Works good but connection went Bad...,Had this for my psp in 07 and it worked good until the connector went bad. The sound was clear.
5,DJ db from NYC sm:)e communications is king of breaks!,"This mix, third in a series, is a great addition to you electronic-techno music collection. If you know db, you will love his breakbeat mix."
4,Sweet Mouse,"I love the feel of this mouse in my hand. It feels much bigger and better made in your hand than other notebook mice (sic?).Operation is reliable on anything but very shiney surfaces.I just wish frequency wasn't 2.4 GHz, the same as 802.11. So far interference doesn't seem to be a problem."
3,Mixed results,"I purchased two of these in December - one for me, one as a gift. I have a SanDisk 5-in-1 reader, and this card won't work in it. Don't know if the fit is too snug or if there's a different problem. It does work well, though, in SanDisk's 12-in-1 reader. I was hoping to use this in my digital picture frame, but now it only seems to work well in my camera. Great for taking lots of pictures - I'm just disappointed that SanDisk can't get its own cards to work in its readers."
5,my two cents...,Not a lot to add to the other reviews except to say it is everything it is advertised to be...a great product and you cannot beat the price. I bought it cheap and got it quick.
5,La uso para todo,"Uso mi tarjta conjuntamente con un lector, y la verdad es que la uso para todo, sustitui mi viejo pendrive por esta tarjeta, y ademas la utilizo en mi camara digital, lo recomirndo, aunque tal vez te convenga mas una de 2GB"
5,Great Price,"I wanted to purchase a SanDisk for an upcoming trip to make sure I have plenty of memory for photos. After doing some research I purchased from this company because of the great price. I also got fast delivery time. I have tried the disk - works fine in my camera. Great company, would definitely do business with them again."
2,"Good Product, Poor Service","First let me explain that this is a great product. I bought the card for my canon digital camera and haven't had any problems with it since.The large capacity allows me to take it on long vacations without have to juggle multiple cards around. And as an avid, amateur photographer that is important.The only gripe I have with the product is the rebate. I sent my original UPC code to SanDisk and now they are claiming it was incorrect. Luckily I had kept the packaging for just such an unfortunate occurrence. And as I had expected, I indeed did send them the UPC on the packaging; however, now they are refusing to follow up on their part of the deal.I sent them a letter over two weeks ago and have not received a response. This is unacceptable. It is my understanding that the SanDisk people are crooks. Buyer beware."
3,Mixed quality,I ordered two of these cards. One is fine but the other seemed to disintegrate after just a month or two of use. The connector end of the card crumbled into tiny bits of plastic and metal and the card was no longer readable in any device. I ended up replacing the card with another manufacturer's card.I've also trouble reading these cards in my PC's SD reader slot. Perhaps it is because they are high speed cards? My camera does fine with it so I have resigned myself to using the USB cable to get photos off the card via the camera.
1,digital card,bought this for my camera which sandisk says all there cards areguaranteed to be compatible with all digital camera's. except mine the minalta 414 ... but it was impractible to return because of theextremely high shipping and handling.... sorry amazon moving on to a different site.. you were no help in this matter
5,1GB SanDisk,"Why they even sell cameras with a 16MB memory card is beyond me as it is good for less than 20 pictures of poor quality - put at least a 128 and give the buyer a bit more picture capacity. 1GB gives me more than enough memory to take 100's of pictures at the highest quality. I can take as many pictures as necessary, review them and save only the best still having room for 100's more. Don't buy anything less than 1Gig, the price differential between smaller sizes and the 1Gig is not worth it."
1,SanDisk NOT,Purchased this for a sharp Electronic cash register. Could not get it to work. Called sharp support and was advised that it had to be formatted on a computer before using in the register. Card reader in computer did not recognize the card. Borrowed an external card reader and also did not recognize card. Then went to staples where I purchased the cash register and threatened to return because I could not get it to read t he sandisc card without being formatted and I could not format same. At staples they tried to for-matte the card on three different computer with out success. Finally determined the card was no good. My money was refunded but shipping was lost. Purchased a different mfg card and had no further problems.First time I have ever heard of a bad sd card but now I know its possible to have one.
5,"Works fine, and it nicely made",Works fine; It is nicely made; the memory is still good.Great for older cameras; so this way the camera willtake many more good pictures;
1,Hobbyists beware!,"This book and its sister volume are much too technical and verbose for the average hobbyist. The illustrations are poor black and white photographs and/or drawings that are not of much help in identifying cacti that most of us would encounter. The material also seems to be dated, and very, very limited in some areas of general interest, (schlumbergera, for example....) I have found these books to be of little help, and certainly not worth the price...."
3,so so,This series is not up to Stephen King's not too high standards. It's just not as much fun. For me most of his books are rapid page turners. I have come to expect them to hold my interest. This one simply doesn't; it's the bad apple in the bunch.
3,Rather disappointing,"I've read through the first two books and I have to say, it was a rather boring experience. I was recommended these by some online friends who said they were brilliant. The first book was rather drawn out; the main plot is based around the character's memories as he walks through a desert. It makes you feel like you've missed something the whole time. It made me feel like there should have been a book before the first and was a bit angry that he spent most the time focusing on the past than what was currently happening. Half of the second book revolves around the main character and one of the people he has 'drawn' into his world. It again was a dragged out narrative that seemed to go nowhere.I dig King's descriptions of the events, but I would have liked to see the plot move faster. I haven't read all four books in the set, but I imagine much won't change."
5,Bought for my husband,While I don't read this type of books he does and by the way he has spent so much time reading them I have to think that he really enjoyed them.
4,Offbeat Powell and Loy film,"William Powell wasn't making too many films at this time due to the recent death of his fiancee Jean Harlow. What he did make was made with Loy.Here he plays a bohemian/hippie type artist to Loy's hard working character. He lives in a trailer and gets engaged to Loy's sister but we all know what happens next. Despite knowing the ending, they do a great job with the story helped along with a strong supporting cast. 4.5 Stars"
4,Good early novel,"This early book of Iris Johansen is a nice blend of romance and adventure. What it lacks in coherent character development it makes up for in charm. Ten years before the book starts Gabe Falkner saved a 14 year old Ronnie Dalton from an earthquake wrecked hotel without ever knowing her name. Gabe is a journalist who managed to be in the wrong place at the wrong time and has spent a year as a hostage to a rebel leader, in part because of Ronnies' father illegal activities. Ronnie has hero-worshipped Gabe from a far from years. She even became a photojournalist because of him and this situation gives her the opportunity to pay him back by rescuing him. It is a decent early effort by a great author and well worth the read if you can find it."
3,Can there be too much sex? YES!!!!,"This book was good and not so much, all at one time.Never thought I'd say this but, there was way too much sex, or maybe too much detailed sex. Honestly, I was tired of reading the H/h's love scenes - it was too much people!Now the plot, I liked. Never warmed up to Seth that much - I liked him, but he was a little crass - but now that is just me, he might be another readers dream guy. Another thing, I did not totally hate the Villian (Victor) - there was something about Victor I liked, even though he was a bad guy (I might be a bit twisted...but he was a tortured soul to me).I liked certain parts of the book and other parts were boring. It was just soooo much stuff going on, I got a little restless.This one, you gonna have to give it a try; I am not sorry I bought it...but I left it exhausted."
1,"So, this is supposed to be love?","First, he watches her without her knowing. In Oregon, you go to jail for that. Next, he virtually rapes her. Lovely. Oh, and let's not forget about all that marvelous verbal abuse they spew back and forth under the heading of small talk. Sick, twisted and totally disfunctional.If you need a story of a broken hero being repaired, I recommend Dark Desire or Dark Magic by Christine Feehan. Avoid the stomach turning story of a woman who hasn't a clue about what love means. And on top of that, the 'steamy' loves scenes have all the heat of tepid water."
1,Behind closed Doors,"I just started this book and have no intention of finishing. I agree with one reviewer that it is nothing but a porn book. The story might have merit but the descriptive language is pretty much, too much. I love JD Robb Dallas Series and this doesn't even come close and her books are pretty graphic. Big thumbs down from me and whatever I paid for it was too much."
3,Not very good,"This was my first Shannon McKenna book and I'm not sure if it will be my last. The reviews on this book have been pretty good and I don't understand why. Sure, the sex scenes were steamy, but Seth was a jerk to Raine and she was such a wuss. He continually used his power to control her. It didn't make sense why Raine would take that from any man. I didn't quite understand how Raine could continually go back to him and let him take advantage of her. In the end, this book was not very good. There was no real love between Seth and Raine."
1,"Wow, just wow.","I tried to read this book with an open mind, but I'd only gotten a few pages in before my BS detector redlined.The fact that this has received any positive reviews, let alone christian book awards, simply blows my mind. No one involved in the production of this book appears to have applied any critical thinking to reviewing this book. Did the editor fact check any of the authors claims? Including things that should be easy to verify (such as winning a World Kung Fu championship three times).It just reads like total BS. Petting wild tigers in the jungle, Kumitai death matches, winning world titles for non-existant Kungfu organisations who also sponsor basketball players? Much of what the author claims as personal experience seems to be thinly veiled borrowings from martial arts and action movies.You would need a massive suspension of disbelief to enjoy this book."
5,Breaking The Norm...,"So I just picked up this cd and I'm very impressed. I'm not a SCI fan, but I have been waiting for this disc to come out for what seemed like months. I'm really into jambands and dance music, so I have tons of respect for a guy who wanted to bring it together. Basically the album is great house beats with SCI samples, all in a continuous mix. It is exactly what I thought it would sound like, it is a MUST for any fan of dance music and jambands, even if SCI isn't your thing. This guy obviously knows what he is doing and does this album justice, blurring the lines between jam music and electronic music."
4,Harvey Early Years,"This is a collection of three of Jonathan Harvey's early plays in a small print paperback format. Few notes or extras but at least it puts the brilliant Harvey into more circulation. It is interesting to note the mixed focus of ""Babies"" and the dead-on sharp focus of ""Beautiful Thing"", the turning point in Harvey's career as a playwright. This volume is probably primarily intended for actors and directors."
1,Not worth the money,"The mirrors were scratched, also one mirror was bright green and the other was red. I wasnt picky about the colors but at least wanted both to be the same color. Definitely not happy with this product."
4,Fender Deluxe Reverb Amp Cover,Very nice cover...it will protect the amp and it should work well. It is a tight fit and a bit short but should work fine. Thank you for the quick shipping.
2,Funny. Would be nasty if real.,Faces of Death 1 - 3 were more realistic. Nice try with 4. I laughed so hard my stomache hurt.
1,Why bother about this junk?,"Hey,I saw this so-called Faces of Death IV on VHS many years ago and I just think it is revolting. It is a another disgusting piece of gore-cinema, because 99% of this stuff is handmade, I mean faked, and not even good.You can not kill a man in a gory cult ritual with a pocket knife, neither you cut so easy off his nose. This whole movie stinks. It is just unbearable boring, just a few scenes are a little entertaining as the magican gets ""killed"" in a freak fire, head squashing accident (the fake head is great) and the hostage situation where the guy highly exaggerates his acting ability by far.But anyway it's just a garbage bag, not entertaining, not really scary and not near as good as it's reputation...File-it-forget it!jw"
5,Clever and Quick,"While all of the albums from EFO are exceptional Quick is over the top. Fun and witty lyrics matched with eloquent melodies... one of the best so far. In addition Quick holds the hidden jem of a lulaby in ""Hey Little Man"" that will bring you to a peaceful sleep every time."
2,"Not for the lay reader - uneven, often tedious and contradictory","I have been slogging through this book for weeks now, it was a terrible shock to the system after John Julius Norwich's excellent book on Byzantium. The book lacks any narrative thrust, often stopping and retreading events slightly out of chronological order and frequently bringing all forward motion to a halt by describing the intricacies of some bureaucratic office or another. The one consistent thing throughout this book is the author's obvious agenda to ""set the record straight"" and prove that the Ottoman empire was far superior to its ""barbaric"" European contemporaries."
3,Not for academics.,"A nice gloss, however. It should inspire more thoughtful readers to seek to expand their knowledge in more scholarly sources. Also, for clarity's sake, it should be pointed out that Kinross is English. The peerage thing never caught on in the States."
3,Surprisingly Easy Read for 700 Pages,"Lord Kinross is very successful at historic storytelling.To take a subject as vast as the empire was during its peak, and to organize it in such a coherent and readable fashion is no easy feat. He covers a lot of ground from politics to art, individual personalities to the ""Ottoman Image"" in the rest of the world.But I must add that as a Turk, I was dissappointed with the fact that it had a whole lot of overlap with our dismal history courses in high school. I haven't learned much, I did not really get the perspective I hoped for.I guess for a beginner, it's a great introductory text, but stay away from ""Ottoman Centuries"" if you already have a good foundation on Ottoman history."
1,Wrong information,"In the book, you will find the map of the Ottoman Empire in 16th century. However, just right up the Mesopotamia, its written KURDISTAN and ARMENIA. Just because of this wrong information, I quit reading the book and I do not want to share this book with the people around me. There were Kurds and Armenians, not Kurdistan and Armenia. Armenia was under the rules of Ottoman and Russia and re-gained its independence in 1991, not in 16th century. And where is even Kurdistan exist? I would recommend people to read another book that does not give WRONG INFORMATION about HISTORY."
2,"Read ""Report On Turkey"" By George Horton, Insted","I'll use the words of a former customer review : ""It's almost a modern soap opera."" If this is the average level of the american reader then I guess all books will be like this in the future! It's thrilling how a writer can turn a 400 year old empire that kept it's regions in a 3rd world state into a lovely novel. I knew Americans had a special sympathy for Turkish people, but history should be told as it was made, not through the modern commercial style, for which we got USA to thank for..."
1,A Nightmare!,"Would not install (non-stop errors). Continually showed ""disabled"" (I'd enable it on the menu and the icon would only show ""disabled""). Crashed my other software. Support is NONEXISTENT! (They have the nerve to charge $30.00 for technical support- per incident- for help with the garbage they've sold you. Perhaps the only way to actually get help but they weren't getting another dime out of me) I can't believe what's happened with this company. Three years ago it was all we used in our offices (and me at home). Honestly, this has been the worst experience I've ever had with any software. My other four computers have McAfee (no problems). One came with Norton AntiVirus preinstalled so I purchased the (same) firewall. Needless to say they BOTH went! Never again! Just hearing the word ""Norton"" gives me hives-"
5,Great Product!,"This product exceeded my expectations! Looks good, sturdier than I expected, very easy to put together, thankfully, since I usually fight with assembly. Much higher quality than I expected for the price."
4,Great product,"I made 4 calendars as Christmas gifts for relatives. I found the kit very easy to use, and felt it printed high quality looking pics. I did not like the binding which was too weak to hold a calendar with 15 heavy pages. I ended up taking my finished calendars to Kinko's. For less than $5 each, they added better binding and put protective plastic sheets between the pages. The end product looked very professional and fun."
3,Pepper pad,"neat little device. didn't do what I needed it to do though (lock onto one webpage). could have a little bit bigger of a screen. good to keep in the kitchen or living room to look up fast facts.....not exactly ""typing"" friendly, good for people who do not do alot of email or computer work. Good for the money."
1,Very disappointing,"The size, weight and design of the machine is fine, but the OS is a complete disaster. It was a bad sign when it crashed during the set up process, and things got worse from there. The touchscreen is awful, response times are slow, and it wouldn't even properly set the date and time. Although it found the wireless network, it could not transmit any data. (All the other devices in the house were transmitting fine.) The product is a great idea, but the execution is a complete failure. I sent mine back the next day."
2,Not good enough,"I as well do not own this.This machine missed the boat. Like the other reviewer said, it NEEDS 802.11g and I think the screen should be a minimum of 10"" like the viewsonic airpanel and a 15"" upgrade would be cool."
5,Quite simply: Amazing.,"My partner and I own an architecture firm; Thymes Azur is a favourite of ours for client gift baskets. Always, always are we in receipt of tremendous thanks for enlightening their lives with this fabulous product. Hasn't disappointed yet!"
2,Basic,"I bought this book for a biblestudy with my friend, and I just didn't feel it challenged me spiritually. We didn't end up finishing the book."
3,Can't find focus,"I read a brief, positive blurb about this book in the New Yorker and picked it up. I figured, what's not to like? Although Epstein is a pretty good storyteller, he can't really figure out what he wants to do in this book. Sometimes he's kind of doing a comparative textual analysis of Whitman's poetry and Lincoln's speeches, sometimes he's looking at spots of time where their lives intersect, sometimes he's doing completely independent biographical studies of these two men, and sometimes he's doing other stuff altogether. The results are fragmented, messy, disorienting. There are sections that, on their own, are quite interesting, but the book never delivers anything whole, and it certainly never delivers what it promises in its title. My recommendation to readers is to pick up individual authoritative biographies of each of these men, and let your mind do its own comparative work."
3,"Not So Much a ""Revelation"" as it is a REFLECTION","The author has not really ""opened any closets"" to the millions of attendees of this nation's Black churches. Everything printed is common knowledge to even the most infrequent churchgoer. It is that familiarity with the goings on that makes the book garner many smiles and ""Amen's"" as it is read. However, one must wonder what the author's purpose was in writing a book that is not likely to receive crossover appeal, thus the need to ""expose"" the Black Church. In addition, like an earlier reviewer stated, the shortness of the book also makes it highly overpriced."
1,Spammers Don't Deserve Your Business!,"Good heavens, I received over a DOZEN email spams from these people TODAY alone! I certainly won't ever buy their book, and I strongly urge that no one else do either!"
5,Excelent!,"This is the best motherboard I had ever had! The SLi feature to run 2 video cards make this baby a monster for gaming experience...I currently have it with an Intel Core 2 Quad of 2.40GHz, OCZ 2 GB DDR2 PC2-6400 and a Geforce 8600GT Pcie 512MB DDR2 and It runs perfect! No instalation problems!"
3,"This isn't for Dual Graphics Cards, It only supports 2 cards at 8x each not 16x each.","The board is great for one graphics card, and it supports one card at 16x. I am using an 8800gts and they work well together. The problem was when I found out this board only supports dual graphics cards at 8x each for a max of 16x. I know that the next step above this board is about $40 more and it can support dual graphics cards at 16x each.--I would rate it a 5 if for single card, but I can't believe they would even make a dual graphics card option with less than 16x each because you know anyone doing that will want the best. :)I am not going to go that far, and if I was I would simply get a new Mobo along with the second card.-Good luck to ya all"
1,No drivers for Windows Vista or Windows 7,"Although the product description states ""Supports most PC operating systems"", and the technical details goes further to say ""Jumperless configuration and support for all major operating systems"", this does NOT include modern Windows versions such as Vista, Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008. Also, no 64 bit OS support. StarTech tech support says there is no plan to add drivers for these Windows versions."
2,Boxing?,"This video was much different than i expected, not even close to as intense as i was hoping. went through very basic drills and exercises and was not much fun. I dont think I even watched it all"
2,Duran Duran Unseen ?,"Duran Duran: Unseen . . .: Photographs 1979 - 82I was initially very excited to see this book on the market. I was in my preteen years when Duran Duran first started out. I was not really exposed to the band until the ""Rio"" album became popular in the USA. I have been an avid fan since then, so I was glad to have access to a book of photos from their early days. The book to my surprise included many photos of people other than the band. Although these people may be very relevant to the ""New Romantic"" history, and what was going on in Britain's culture when Duran started out, I was surprised that not more photos of the band were included. Any avid fan, I believe, would rather have had the majority of the book be devoted to photos of Duran Duran themselves. I am still glad I purchased the book, but there was ""Too Much Information"" not pertaining to the band. Happy Shopping, Durannies out there!"
1,"Work, not play","At the risk of appearing too dense to appreciate this book, I must submit that the 3 rave reviews- which constitute its present entire coverage here- are *not* describing what I experienced from this book. I am an avid science fiction reader, averaging 10-15 titles each year. Still, my reading is my primary recreation, and I do not willingly subject myself to books such as this one. The plot line is *so* convoluted, and *so* impossibly imbedded in abstractions of dimension and mathematics that I was tempted to write a chart to keep some organization of the first 100 pages. Then I realized that the book was not an assignment- it was a choice! Too much work, too little pay off. Having just finished re-reading Vinge's last 2 novels, colorful, whole-world operas which took me to a wonderful place, I had no intention of swallowing Garfinkle's castor oil.Don't get this just to flatter your intelligence."
1,Couldn't Finish It,"I read Sci-Fi almost exclusivly. However, I am not a Fantasy fan and that seemed to be the flavor of this book. I gave up after 30 pages."
4,4 Dimensional!,"The idea of ""time wars"" is not a new one, but Garfinkle cannily sets the action in four dimensions, not three. The time warriors have ""tails"" -- their own bodies extending backward into the past -- and they use them! Mining technological treasures from an ever-changing future history is also a novel twist. This is a fun, fascinating read."
1,I could only stand to watch it once,I found the dvd to be very boring. A man does most of the speaking throughout. He was very monotone and not motivating. I was annoyed having some who would never go through pregnancy explain the benefits. He obviously will never have experience. The woman doing the exercises was pregnant.
1,Man and Dummy,"I didn't think this tape has nearly enough yoga postures and doesn't hold most of them nearly long enough. In the 55-minute tape, there is perhaps 20 minutes of workout and the rest is breathing and the man who does the tape talking, while his pregnant wife silently does everything he says (occasionally interjecting with her strange, useless information about how a pose made her feel)."
4,Gentle workout,"I enjoy the Yoga Zone tape & do it willingly because it isn't too hard & yet gives a nice workout. Afterwords, I feel relaxed & warmed up. There are some especially nice postures for the back. My only critisism is that it could use a little music. I play a Cd on my stereo to compensate."
2,Very Annoying!,"I love yoga but this work out left me wondering where the stretches were! They moved very quickly from one position to the other without sufficent time spent in any pose. The man's voice in this video just rubs me the wrong way and I used to watch it with the sound off, but just gave up and sold the video as I really didn't enjoy using it."
3,blessing,Is this bible on cd. I really like and appreciate the extent the author went through. It is a great study bible and helpful in doctrine.
3,Brutal,"This movie is brutal. I was introduced to it as a type of political comedy, but I honestly found very little humor in the story. The characters are excellently played. The script definitely draws in the audience. It is just a tough movie to watch. The ending is definitely not Hollywood Happy, but it makes a point about corruption, the senselessness that can be found in war, and how things just sometimes turn out badly. Definitely worth watching, but having something uplifting to do afterward or your faith in humanity may take a beating."
4,Great War Movie,"""No Man's Land"" is a great movie that deals with the Bosnian War. It has many unique scenes that give the audience more enjoyment to watch. The storyline was wonderfully written. It blends multiple stories into one movie. This is highly difficult considering most of it explores trying to rescue a soldier from a mine that'll detinate if he moves. The acting is great. The gun shootouts scenes, they express their characters' life threateneng terror realistic looking. The environment (the set) looks as if an actual war is breaking, which is good. Such wonderful efforts deserved the Oscar nomination for Best Foreign Film(spoken mostly in sebro-croatian). It later won. ""No Man's Land"" is a great movie for those looking for action and drama. Such substance will keep everyone entertained."
5,If you have ever thought about being a State Trooper,"This book is great if you have ever thought about a career in the Highway Patrol. Just realize though it was written back in the 1980's and things have changed alot in the orgainization as a whole, but the people are still as crazy and dangerous as ever. The Stories are real and you can't put this book down."
3,Faces of Death Collections,I first watched this movie when I was ten and could not keep my eyes off of the screen.Now that I'm older I still enjoy it but the fact that most of the scenes were not real really disappointed me but the movie is still off the wall crazy.Enjoy it best alone and in the dark
3,faces of death vol 1,i think that is a great documentary and itz very interesting too.i first saw it years ago and i always wanted a copy of it.
5,Great Buy,I purchased this double stroller for my twin girls. Very easy to handle. The swivel front wheel is a big plus and it can lock if needed.
3,I really wanted to like this,"I'm not sure why reading this is so tedious, but 279 pages in I'm still waiting for a reason to care about this overly formal simpleton, John Grimes.These stories start and proceed s l o w l y with too many words, too much nautical lingo and too little action. Then they end. I mean they just end.If there is humor or clever dialog here I must be missing it. It's just plodding flowery language that goes nowhere.I'm not sure how this author developed a following. His main character is just a stuffed shirt. This strikes me as almost fan fiction for the Hornblower books.I've bought two more books in the series and I'm still trying but ""trying"" is the word for these rambling go nowhere tales where the highlight is usually for good old John to get laid by a redhead."
1,A Boring list of common places,"Page after page, motivational phrases and cites with no structure or development of any kind.Boring, a waste of $$$ and time."
3,Smaller than a size #0,"I use size #0 envelopes to ship CDs and DVDs, while these envelopes are great quality, they are much smaller than the average size #0 envelope. It is highly difficult to fit a DVD inside these envelopes, and it's even a struggle for a CD."
3,Need To Secure Them With Extra Packing Tape!,"These are decent mailing envelopes, good trusted name brand. They seem to hold up well in the mail, I have mailed hundreds of them over the past few years. But the flap has a secure stick closure that itsn't that strong. I would recommend wrapping a piece of packing tape around it for added protection. I have sealed these envelopes and forgot to put something inside, and was able to open the package back up and add the item, and then fold it shut again. Yes, convenient, but it's not too satisfying to think someone could open the package during transit and do the same thing or take things out. I have recently found better sealing, better quality, better priced envelopes online than these."
2,Lids Will Not Close,I was a bit disappointed by the fact that the lids on these boxes will not stay closed. I should have gone with the more expensive Rubbermaid product.
5,Index Card file box,My wife is a bartender and has receipts on 4x6 cards. This box held a lot of her receipts.
2,Not for me,"I am not a perfume wearer, but I heard that this is very light and unlike any other perfume. I got this in the roll-on and I don't care for it at all. Just like all other perfumes, it makes me nauseated. I'll be giving this to a relative for Christmas."
5,Beautiful set,"This box set is a beautiful collection of constellation artwork, maps, and a brief guidebook. Great for people who love stars, art or a combination of both."
4,"Bueno, pero no como me lo platicaron.","Este audiobook es bueno, esta muy completo, pero al me lo habia descrito como algo espectacular, y esto hace que yo esperara mas, pero realmente es bueno."
1,Will only work with Valterra hose.,"Connection was leaking badly at connection. Clamp would not solve problem.8/22/2012: Finally figured out the problem. Valterra connectors have a right hand thread. Only Valterra hose has the same thread direction. These connectors will not work with any hose but Valterra,"
1,flimsy,I am used to the ever ready style leather camera cases on my film SLR cameras. This so called case gives no protection except from dust. Save your money and buy an SLR size camera bag instead.
3,"The Osprey Air Combat Series is rather uneven,","in content if not readability. Like all in this series, this book is very well crafted, an enjoyable read from start to finish. It is very strong on historical aspects of the Phantom, giving a wide range of stories from its very wide user base. If you are after tech data, it does come up short. No real specifications supplied, so if you are after 'how far/how fast', this book is not for you. If you want a well done good read, you will enjoy it rather much, however."
2,Disappointed,"I have been saving up for a while to buy this package; I have had my eye on it for years. I have owned the power yoga disc in this package for years and in all honesty, that is the only one you need. The Yoga for Weight Loss disc is for beginners and is very slow and doesn't do much for me. The Flexibility disc is ok; I expect more than OK from YogaZone. Of course the Power Yoga disc is great, but I already knew that.I would suggest avoiding this set and building your own library of discs."
4,Weight loss unnecessary,"I accidentally stumbled upon Yogazone and their videos. I like them, they're easy to follow, even though the instructors seem a bit overacting sometimes.I am new to yoga and I have picked up a lot from these videos (my girlfriend has taken classes and agrees). I should say that we mostly go by the Flexibility and Stress Release, because that is what we need! The Power Yoga is much more of a workout and we find it hard to follow when being tired, e.g. after surfing.The Weight loss is not needed, I think. It suffers from bad flow and the exercises are not as good as those for the other two videos.Taken together, the DVDs are very good, if you try to ignore the frequent acted chuckling of the instructors."
4,Just like the movie,"Undeworld was written just like the movie portrays it. The only difference maybe in the greater detail. I believe the book goes into a greater detail with some of the lesser visible characters and with some of the story. One instance from the story line is how Selene and Michael get back to the mansion after her car runs into the river. I also was unaware that the story took place in Prague (maybe I just missed that in the movie). There is also more detail about Erika, the blonde from the movie that chases after Kraven.I saw the movie first, but I still enjoyed the book."
2,Palisade Decision Suite Student Edition CD Does Not Work,"The Palisade Decision Suite Student Edition CD does not work on my PC. Installed with macro errors.I am on a Windows 7 Professional O/S on a 32-bit machine, using Microsoft Office 2010."
3,"Great, If you are still Using Excel 2003","This books was written to work with excel 2003. If you are using a newer version, you will run into some problems."
4,A toy enthusiast,"My son received this for his second birthday. He played with it for hours, it was his favorite gift. Very cute, love how the figures spin on the discs. Lots of fun! The only down side is that the large slide on the side keeps falling off as does the bench, a door and a piece that goes in the center of the middle disc. All pieces are safe and not small enough to choke on and does not interfere with the fun he has but it is a pain to have to keep putting them back on. I'd still purchase it again though."
3,Very Disappointed,"My son got this for his first birthday. It was his favorite toy and mine too. Then after just 2 months, the discs wouldn't spin when anything was on it. It basically teased him. He would press the button and everything worked fine, then he'd put a weeble on a disc to watch it spin and they would quit spinning. It went from my son's favorite toy to being totally useless. What a disappoinment."
1,Not Matte finish.,"When I ordered these cards it specifically said ""Matte finish"" 1/4 size Greeting cards but I received Glossy cards instead. Very disappointing!!!!"
1,Never received Item,"I paid for but never received this Item. Amazon did nothing to resolve this Problem as they thru it off on the sender and I wound up eating it.Be careful if you buy on Amazon.Thank You, The WolfmanLast Mile"
5,My Favorite Yoga Workout,"I have used about eight other yoga tapes and this is by far the best. I still can not do everything in the tape, but I love that I have some things to look forward being able to do. I don't think it's too advanced as long as you know your limits and there are modified forms of the poses demonstrated to keep you on the right track. The verbal instructions are great (especially since you are usually upside down and unable to see what to do). I feel strong, energized and cheerful after each workout. Highly recommended!"
2,Annoying Game,"When you first start playing, Howie's sarcasm is pretty funny, but it goes downhill quickly as you start to hear the same lines over and over again. Most of the questions are so bizarre that we had no clue what they were talking about. We all agreed that the hot seat mat and chips were pointless and this game could have been sold as just a DVD...not that we would buy it."
5,Dogs love it!!,Bought this for our Boston Terriers (9 and 7 years old). Put it inside a large round bed we bought from another source. They love it! Keeps the bed nice and toasty. I leave it on all day and only unplug it at night when we go to bed. Our older dogs spends most of his day on the bed and couldn't be happier. I definitely recommend this product.
1,Where's Quality Control????,"I plugged it in. It didn't heat. I returned it. Fool me once..... I'm looking for something better than this, especially from Amazon."
2,Maybe better for larger animal,For some reason none of my cats; inside or outside will not lay on whatever I have this under. I think maybe it is too warm for smaller animals.
2,"Great warm bed, while it lasts","My older cat just loves her heated bed. She has to have it because she has arthritis and is just so small and gets real cold without it. The heated bed itself is a lifesaver and works very well. But I've gone through two of these heated pet warmers. This last one only lasted about 12 months. I'm about to purchase my third heating pad. So, if it's important enough to you to keep your animal warm, it will cost you about $30 a year. Perhaps other people have had better luck...but a year to 18 months is all I've been able to get out of mine."
3,K&H Pet Bed Warmer (Large),"The power cord length should be longer. Temperature does not get very warm -- more like lukewarm and when placed beneath a thin blanket or lambskin cover, the warmth does not penetrate through making it ineffective. It needs a temperature control setting so it stays at a constant temp or the ability to set it on low, medium or high as needed. It might be more beneficial to the pet if a temp control feature was offered."
1,Dose not work,My four pound dog is always cold even with sweaters and hot water bottles this was not even worth his time to try no heat came off this. My cat perhaps may have liked it sent it back.
5,Works great,"I wanted something that would help my 16 yr old pup stay warm at night. This works great. I put it inside her bed cover and it's large enough that even if she's half off the bed she still gets warmth on some part of her body. She has another bed she can move to if she feels too warm but so far she's content to stay put once she goes to bed. It's a light warmth which is what I wanted. They don't need things that heat up the way people do. Anyway, I'm pleased, she's happy and comfortable. That's what I wanted."
1,barely warm,What a waste. I purchased 5 of these to donate to my local animal shelter for kitten newbornes and these warmers barely get warm!!! Even after 2-3 hours use they didn't get warmer. I had to return them.
4,My cat loves it,"This item is perfect for the kitty that needs a warm place to curl up.I leave it on 24/7, and my older cat is glued to it during the winter.Only downside is that it does not come with a cover...a fleece lining would have been nice. I just use a towel to cover it and place it in a pet bed."
5,Not too warm,You plug it in and wait and nothing seems to happen. It takes a while and it does not get very warm. HOWEVER my cats LOVE it. It needs a cover as it arrives without one or you can cover it with some cloth. I would buy it again.
4,Happy DogsOu,Our 2 20# dogs love having a heating pad. They are getting older and tend to feel the cold more. The dogs settle in on their heating pad and sleep all night. The heat seems to help their arthritis in their hips as they walk a little less stiffer in the morning.We are very happy with these pads. They are easy to set up and the dogs love them.
3,Rather disappointed,"I'll go ahead and use these, but next time I'll get heating pads (which is basically what they are anyway) except that then I could set the temperature myself. Supposedly these automatically set to different temperatures according to a cat's presence but now that I've seen them I believe that's improbable. They are just stiff plastic sleeves with the kind of wiring inside that electric blankets have. Heating pads would be cheaper, better quality and I think, safer."
3,my dog loved it alright... loved to chew it up,this got warm like it said it would but my dog could resist chewing on the cord. even when i wrapped it up and hid it the best i could. wasn't work my dog getting zapped.
1,Where is the heat?,"I got this for a stray cat that has adopted my wife and I as his caregivers. I care about the little guy, so I bought this to keep him warm. Problem is, this item produces so little heat it is of no value at all. Maybe the one I have is defective, but I am going to buy a substitute locally rather than order something else from Amazon. ( After I reread this review I thought I should point out that the problem is entirely with the product, not with Amazon. Amazons service in delivering the product and picking it up for return was absolutely 5 star.)"
4,My Cat Loves IT!,"We've only had this for about a week, but, so far, it works great and my old gal just loves it. It maintains a good even heat for her."
4,Good for a little extra warmth for your pup!,"We bought this to help keep our lab warmer during the winter months. Granted, we are in California, so the modest amount of warmth is fine for our climate - probably not for really cold winters, though. We put the pad under a blanket in the dog igloo, a combination that seems to create a nice warm area for her. This pad works as well as the $80 one that we bought last year."
1,Disappointed,"While I personally, very much appreciate and enjoy the spectacular images of earth as photographed from space, I would also have appreciated, indeed expected, intelligent and expert commentary. My children were bored to tears after ten minutes, as were the adults. I had this feeling that we were somehow ""stuck"" in a preview mode of the overall program. True, the soundtrack is both soothing, and well matched to the visual. But the absence of commentary soon makes you feel as though you're listening to the sort of trendy, cosmic whatever that you might hear in,...well, your dentist's office. Bummer."
4,This is a book review,"Please note that this article is only a two page book review of Neuhaus book ""Doing Well and Doing Good"" by Richard Bayer of Fordham University, published in Theological Studies. Not having read the book I cannot comment on the review, but though I should let readers know that this is not a ""paper"" or a summary of the book."
1,Lies from satan!,"Barbara and many other scholars apparantly are ""drinking the kool-aid"" found in the caves where the dead sea scrools were found. Good acheological find - for the lies of satan. It is also very apparant that they were planted by satan's followers to confuse people and denounce the Son of God. There is already too much geological,historical,Biblical,theological,and just plain common sense facts to dispel and contradict these artifacts. The researchers could better spend their time on researching the truth(s)found in Jesus Christ based on faith and knowledge of the one and only true Word of God. Watch out people! ""Anyone who adds to or takes from the Word of God is guilty of hell and damnation"" THIS IS LITERAL-NOT A SO-CALLED PARABLE!! Faith as a little child, and belief is the key. It is so sad how satan has blinded so many from the beginning by trying to convince people to become wiser than God."
2,Not all 140 lb paper!,"I ordered 2 packs of this ""Arches 140 lb cold Press Watercolor Paper"". Even though the water mark on the paper said it was Arches, several of the sheets in each pack were not nearly as thick as 140 lb Arches Cold Press usually is. It looked as if they may have been Arches rejects. The package was not the usual Arches plastic packaging that I have received many times when I have bought Arches from other sources. I ordered this for an upcoming watercolor workshop, to share with another artist. I thought the paper thickness (weight) may have been just my imagination, but the other artist called to my attention that the paper seemed too thin to be 140 lb as well. The cost was less than what I usually pay for Arches, but I guess you get what you pay for!! I won't be ordering from this source again."
2,Changes the Story (Potential Spoilers),"I originally read the original 600-some page novel of the same title and author was and knocked out by it and wanted more...so I went to this. Not my best idea. It's intresting to read, but this menga copy changes some major aspects of characters from the novel. One character seems to just turn into a sex-crazed nut, which is not the same way at all it happens in the original novel. By changing this, the characters become alot less likeble.On the plus side, the characters are actually drawn differently, making it easy to tell one character from another. I most likely will end up checking out some of the rest of the series; however, I would HIGHLY recomend going through the original 600 page novel instead of this."
3,"Brilliant story, horrible translation","I am a big Battle Royale fan, having seen the movie and read the novel, I naturally bought this manga the moment it came out. Sadly Tokyopop's tendancy to try to make their titles ""trendy"" kicked into overdrive, so alas we have what can only be described as ""an awful translation"".Keith Giffen, I am disapointed in you. Here is a list of some of his ""trendy dialouge"".""Level with me, Yoshi, was I not born to rock? That's rock as in roll, ,'freind, just in case you haven't been paying attention."" -Page 17""What? No boogie-woogie flue?"" -Page 146""Don't mind Shu. Got a bad case of the rock and rool pneumonia"" -Page 146While the story is easily a 5 star affair, the mind numbing translation used detract from the story so badly that it merely falls into the 3 star category."
2,Too many errors,"The focus on the queueing networks is novel and meaningful. But the book needs to be polished--reading with errata is anyway unpleasant. Applications to queues are good, but the underlying LDP theory are scratchy. Use it as a reference book, not a textbook."
5,Great product,"This luxurious cream is a great product! Light, fresh scent, with a non-greasy feel. I would highly recommend this to anyone."
1,not glossy at all...,"I have their matte and 30 spf matte lotion,, this ""glossy"" is the same stuff,, not glossy.... did mine come packaged wrong,,, waste of 10 bucks...."
3,Poor derivations,This book discusses more the theory of fluid flow versus the applications of fluid dynamics. I found the derivations to be poorly explained as well as the assumptions used for said derivations. I would recommend this book more towards Math majors interested in fluid dynamics instead of engineering majors because the mathematics required to derive the equations used are typically not taught to standard engineering students.
3,Why not try...,"Although significantly older than this text, I would suggest that readers look for a copy of 'The Aerodynamic Design of Aircraft' by Dietrich Kuchemann (Pergamon, 1976). Although not particularly up to date in terms of the advent of complex CFD methods, Kuchemann's text is an essential summary of the progress of analytical aerodynamics, and it's experimental underpinnings, from Gottingen in the Ludwig Prandtl era, through to the technology of the mid 1970s."
5,The BEST greeting card paper,"I've had a terrible time trying to find this paper, it is superior to anything I've used in the past - the pictures come out really crisp and the colors are clear and sharp. I've printed the same card on 3 different papers, and the one on Invent It paper was by far the best. Now the problem - it's impossible to find this paper anywhere - maybe it has been discontinued. I bought it this last time on Amazon through one of their independent dealers and apparently it is all that was left. Darn - find a good product and it goes away!"
4,"Good features, short life","These are the only frosted MR16 20-watt wide/flood bulbs I've found. Feature wise, they are very good and can broadly light large areas more evenly than spotlights, which can light smaller areas more brightly. There is a bit of multi-colored backspill like most of these bulbs have in case you use them without some kind of backing. Their main fault is that they do not last very long compared to longer life MR16 bulbs (which often last 3,000-10,000 hours instead of 2,000, but they are a bit more expensive), but I don't really have an option since I've never seen any longer life bulbs with the same features. The seller always packs things very securely, ships instantly, and I've never received a dead bulb."
4,Easy pocket backgammon,"Fits easily into a knapsack or laptop bag, and the magnets seem very durable. Only complaint I have - and this is very very minor - is that it can be possible to squish this a bit. Easy and convenient way to bring along a favorite board game!"
3,meh you get what you pay for,The green part of the flag had darker blotches but I mean you get what you pay forr
1,TOOO Expensive!,I chose this rating as it is entirely too expensive. Pure and simple. Why in the world would it be this expensive if written after the year 2000?
2,"Good as a reference book, bad as a step by step book",Well for one I am a novice artist ... actually I am totally new to drawing anatomy and was expecting both a step by step book and a decent reference book.Well the good side is I have a ton of reference out of this beauty ... the bad part is there is almost no step by step procedures. The drawings are nice but the very few step by steps are really accelerated ...All in all this is a nice book to have around for reference and might do wonderfully well for an experienced artist ... but this really isn't the best choice for starters.
4,Pretty good book.,"This book arrived earlier than expected. I read through it and it seems to be pretty detailed. I myself am not the best of artists, but I do know a bit, and this book certainly helps with anatomy, as that is not one of my strong suits. Overall, good book."
3,Soundtrack for the movie,"This CD contains some new tracks ( including the Terry Britten penned ""Stay awhile"") and some new versions of Ike & Tina classics. It's nice to hear new versions of ""A Fool in Love"", ""it's gonna work out fine"" and other classics. Personally however I prefer the original recordings by Ike and Tina. Especially the new version of ""Nutbush City limits"" and ""Proud Mary"" are much worse than the original. The real soundtrack to Tina's life has still to be released ! The ""collected recordings sixties to nineties"" (Capitol /1994) comes much closer than this. P.S. The European version contains 14 tracks."
4,Absorbing account of WWI experiences,"Irene Rathbone's fictionalized account of her WWI war-time experiences is fascinating and absorbing, but unfortunately often over-looked compared to other war memoirs. The strength of this novel is in the vivid descriptions of a variety of war work undertaken by young upper middle-class women. Rathbone details the working and social lives of her heroines employed in a YMCA canteen in France, as a VAD nurse in a London hospital, and as a munitions worker. The explicitness of her descriptions of tending the wounds of hospitalized soldiers and the conditions in a munitions factory are harrowing at times, but far more realistic than is often encountered in war-time memoirs. While some of the characters are merely stereotypes and the dialogue can be stilted at times, the exactness of her depictions of women's war work makes this recommended reading for anyone interested in WWI literature."
3,Buzz in Audio,"I tried two units before giving up on the JVC. The video was OK (not great color) but the audio was fatally flawed. The camera itself generates a 'whine' which is then picked up by the microphone and recorded. Any quiet recordings, when played back, have this buzzing whining sound added; I found it completely unsatifactory. No provision for an external microphone (which would have been a satisfactory solution) is made! Were it not for this flaw I would have been happy with the camera."
3,"Great Guitar, Weak Vocals","Gary Moore can play some fiery blues-rock guitar. Unfortunately, this is offset by a crooning vocal style that's not at all suited to the blues. Also, the three hardest-rocking songs, ""Cold Day In Hell"", ""Oh Pretty Woman"" & ""King of the Blues"" sound practically identical. Two of the best tracks are the shuffling ""Walking By Myself"" & the B.B. King-style slow blues, ""Jumpin' At Shadows"". If only his voice had as much life as his guitar."
2,2 Duds in a row,"Shipment was prompt but module did not dim....just turned light off and on. Company replaced defective dimmer, sending 2nd one promptly but this was also defective (would turn light off and on but would not dim). I am pretty frustrated at this point since it takes 30 minutes to dissemble pole lamp and install new dimmer and reassemble. Reported 2nd defective dimmer to company and they promptly said they would credit the purchase. Company has been excellent to work with; I'm just sorry they got stuck with defective dimmers. I ended up purchasing (through Amazon) a Thomas and Betts Dimmer which I have just installed and works just fine."
5,Hanus G. Johansen - the most outstanding man from Faroe Islands,"This is a very, very beautiful music of a singer Hanus G. Johansen from Faroe Islands, who is the most outstanding man from that place.The voice of Hanus is unique and his performance is on the highest level. Words of the songs of Hanus has been written in a modified form of the old Norse called Faroese. It is a very beautiful and peculiar language.Every track from this CD is so admirable, sincere and heartfelt that I want to say: 'Thank You, Mr. JOHANSEN, for this remarkable CD!'If You like folk music, if You like Scandinavia and the people of it, You MUST HAVE this CD! You will not be sorry for spent money for this one.In Faroe Islands, where live about 47 000 people, is there so advanced and beautiful contemporary folk music! It is unbelievable!In short. The music is very pleasant to the ear and the cover of this CD pleasant to the eye.Buy it and You will never regret it! You will enjoy it!"
2,Pictures Only,"Great pictures, but only print in the book are the captions. No trainer variant pictues. A good supplement for a book with detailed MiG-21 information."
1,it falls apart,Not a goog edition.It fell apart before I could finish reading it.Not a great content either.Go with weigth whatchers.It's a better choice all the way.
5,Pioneers,"I had the oppotunity to see a video on Paradigms. I bought this book as I have work colleagues who wil not move.(their way is best) I read the book thouroughly and enjoyed it very much and will pass it onto my colleagues.Having read the book I am convinced I am a pioneer who cannot get past the settlers. If you want to improve, read it."
2,Hegelian dialectics for Dummies,"I spent much of one grad school course being assailed by Barker's prognostications, which are essentially the entire body of Hegel's dialectical philosophy distilled to the lowest common denominator (Hegelian Cliff Notes?).Once upon a time, western civlization had intellectuals, and now we have wonks. Once upon a time, members of the business community were actually challenged to think, and now they are required to memorize trite management babble like ""paradigm shift"".As a side note, one of the most incompetent executives I've ever met had, as a stock answer to any question that required contemplative thought, ""that's a paradigm shift!"".Unfortunately for office brown nosers enchanted with Barker, other guru flavors-of-the-month have long since supplanted his musings, so you aren't likely to score any points."
5,The Perfect Beach Book,"This is the type of luscious, non-taxing book you want to eat with a spoon. It is that good. It has everything: A black stallion. A rugged, sexy, troubled but ultra-honorable hunk of a horse-training hero. A beautiful, fey, Irish heroine who may or may not be a witch. A sulky teenaged girl who has to learn a few lessons about life. A vile ogre rapist of an ex-husband.Are you still with me?Add in gorgeous descriptions of the Ireland coast, incredibly erotic and tender love scenes, wonderful descriptions of horse racing, a supernatural sea creature, a crumbling castle, a love affair of legendary proportions...and you will forget all your troubles. The only problem I had while reading this divine book was having to stop to refill my iced tea. This is JoAnn Ross at her absolute best, and I thank her. The pleasure was all mine!!"
3,Dvd #4 Won't Play on Computer or Certain DVD Player,"I liked the episodes in Collection 2, but I had a problem with Disk #4. It played on one of my DVD players (which is also a DVD recorder), but wouldn't play on my computer or my other DVD (play only) player. I don't know why. Since it'd been at least 6 months since I'd bought Collection 2 before I watched disk #4, I didn't even try to contact Amazon about it. So ... when you receive it in the mail, try it out immediately on ALL of the devices you'll be playing it on."
1,Not enough Emotions and Passion,"I felt as if this book was very long althought it only had two hundred and something odd pages. The beginning of the book started out okay but as the story went on it seems there was no ending to it.Carter is trying to find out who murdered his foster brother David, which is really not dead. Carter then notices that Delicia's dauther has a resemblence to his brother, but does not believe his brother will abandoned his child. Delecia tells him a man by the name of Richard fathered her child and left her. Things began to twist and they become attracted to each other when they try to figure out who is murdered and who did the murder.Carter and Delecia's relationship does not has passion as I think it should have. This book is not quite up there with other arabesque novels I read. There is not enough ""umph"" in this novel."
5,Perfect!,"Came in fast, and a really great price. I really needed this desperately, and I ended up getting it. Thank You!"
5,Buy this if taking the COA test,This book made my life so much easier and it helped me pass the COA exam. If you are going for your COA def. get it.
3,You get what you pay for,"Its a silkscreened piece of nylon. Its not high quality by any means, but for under ten bucks it gets the job done. I got it to hang up in my room, but if you wanted to fly it, you should definitely spend more money if you want to have your flag around for a while."
3,Came with thumbtack stuck on it,"The flag came with thumbtack stuck on it; it's hard to get off, it's ugly on it, and it's on both sides"
3,not delighted,"I thought I was getting a combination pack - must have not read the description carefully. I own a Performa litterbox, and have been trying to reorder the liners. I cannot find them - they seem to have discontinued them. I thought this was a combination of both, and even though I don't really want or need the filter, was willing to order it to get the liners. So, while there is nothing wrong with this product, it isn't what I wanted, or needed."
3,Sweet and Silver,"The bracelet came soon after I ordered it, and was in perfect condition.I love the bracelet, it is well made, and looks exactly as described. The only thing I didn't like is the clasp, it's too large, even tho the bracelet is large, I think a different clasp would have looked better.The sender also made it convenient to return the item (if I had so desired) by including all the necessary items/instructions.I would highly recommend this company to all."
5,This is a beautiful piece of jewelry,"Bright and shiny, wrapped around a pillow and in a velvet bag...very, very nice presentation and very well made. It is an extremely beautiful piece of jewelry."
3,Not a good description,"Although this bracelet is beautiful it is, in fact, hollow and not as wide as the picture looks. Certainly, I guess we can calculate mm into in but even then...Should you hit it against something it will flatten out the weave. From what I now gather most of this style are hollow strands of silver weaved together. I am returning this today as I really wanted a solid roped chain and a bit thicker."
3,So So Byzantine,"Bracelet is exactly as pictured, however, the clasp does appear larger than necessary in person. The clasp is difficult to open and latch. Also, the bracelet's light weight makes it feel inexpensive and definitely not worth $50. The finish was more muted than I was hoping. It wasn't shiny, nor was it brushed. It looked dull.It is lovely chain pattern, and it arrived in a nice blue suede drawstring bag with the bracelet ""hugging"" a matching blue suede pillow inside the bag. It would have made a nice gift if the bracelet hadn't felt cheap. I ended up returning it."
4,good band-if u like aerosmith,would like to hear more from brother cane-good band-sounds alot like aerosmith-but a little more rock
1,Unlistenable,"I inherited this album on cassette and digitized it for my collection. It is rare that I can't even make through the entire album once, but this album falls into that category. I'm glad I didn't pay anything for this album."
5,Janet's masterpiece,"I've been a big fan of Janet Jackson since the RYTHEM NATION album. JANET, released back in '93, tops all of her albums. First, it's the most diverse album she's ever made and it plays like a book. JANET clocks in at over 75 mins which makes it an album of epic proportions. The time passes qucikly though, 'cause the album flows very nicely. The interludes add a personal touch to each song. Janet's songwriting is a little more light weight on JANET, making it breezy, fun, sensual, and romantic. Laid back tracks like ""that's the way love goes"" and the tear jerker ""again"" are pop classics. The sound on JANET is R&B mixed with a lot of different influences such as: rock, pop, country, opera and classical to name a few. If you only buy one Janet Jackson album, this is the one to get."
5,You KNOW You Want This...,"For me, this is the definitive Janet Jackson album. So many great tunes fill this disc, from quite possibly her best singles ""That's The Way Love Goes"" and ""If"" to groove laden tunes like ""Because Of Love"" and ""You Want This"". Sweet ballads like ""Again"" and ""Where Are You Now"" are melted into the smoldering sexuality of ""Throb"" and ""Any Time, Any Place"". Summertime pop finds a place too, with the hidden tune ""Whoops Now"" and ""What'll I Do"" being prime examples. Album tracks like ""Funky Big Band"" are great too. Totally solid, it's very hard for me to find flaws in the album. If I only had one Janet album, it would be this one. Go On, Miss Janet!"
4,Couldn't be happier,"I think the contractor failed to install the third screw in this hinge when they assembled our kitchen cabinets, which resulted in strain on the part that broke it. I was able to figure out the replacement part, ordered it. It's an exact match. I would have given it five stars, except that it was really hard to figure out what the correct replacement part is - there are two very similar parts and clues as to which one you want are few.I guessed right, though! Not very difficult to install, and the cabinet door is all hunky-dory now!"
2,A little much,"Althought the story has merit, it was hard to read for all the poetic descriptive language. If I were looking for poetry, I would have loved it. I was, however, looking for a good story about Thailand, and had to wade through a too much flowery description. By the end of the book, it was almost a joke."
4,keith forever,"When Mick Jagger listened to Keith Richards' first solo album said that the sound of the drums was too loud. I am not sure that that was true with regard to Talk is Cheap (1988), but it is certainly true with regard to Main Offender (Keith's second studio album, released in 1992).The record is nice and there are several nice songs. My favorite ones are Eileen, Hate it When You Leave and, above all, Words of Wonder, which shows that Keith Richards is an extraordinary reggae musician.Main Offender is not as good, as interesting, as intense as Talk is Cheap had been few years before. But it is certainly a record worth listening to."
3,oh well,"When Keith's two solo records came out , (especially the first), the comparison to Mick's solo efforts made Keith's seem to be works of genius. A lot of time gone by has put this stuff into the broader perspective of Stones work in general ,and specifically, the best Stones stuff. Keith's hoarse voice seemed soulful at first, now it just seems limited...the band tracks have a rawness that at first gave me the feeling of being on the inside of the process, but now it's time for them to be more finished, and of course, they never -can- be....The real shame is that, while Mick records can , for the most part, be ignored, Keith's can not, because they could have been great Stones records, with a little more work, and course, the Stones."
5,Keith IS the Stones,"For the earlier writer, 999 is the code number for pharmeceutical heroin. That should shed some light on the ""Don't Panic!"" line in the middle of the song.And one more thing; DOES ANYONE KNOW WHEN KEITH IS GONNA MAKE A NEW ALBUM!?!?!?!?!"
4,...,"I read a lot since I work for a book store and this was a new release. I found it very easy to read concerning the print and completed the book during lunch breaks. I offer the simple comment of: It's not what I expected it to be as a poetry book. That's a good thing. I enjoyed it, it held my attention with anticipation and I""m not sure what style this poetry would fall under. It should be placed in a new catagory of it's own because there is every style of poetry in one book here, with an added bonus, ANSWERS. Just come to my store and read a page or two and I'll gaurantee you'll buy it."
3,Biodiversity and Pest Management in Agroecosystems,"The book is written with verbal complexity that is legible to those who have had a certain amount of training in the ecological and biodiversity fields. It puts forth the problems of pest management in monocultures and how they might be addressed by the addition of certain weeds either between the rows or in selected islands, in which the predatory insects might breed and feed when the the leaf feeders are not yet there. It mentions that a grass leaf spray might help to keep some of the plant leaf feeders away from the plants, since they do not feed on grass.There are many charts, some of which are difficult to comprehend.In my case it is a good guide, but not very helpful, because I am mainly interested in vinyards rather than vegetables such as corn or collards or broccoli. The ideas are worth a read as are the methods of control suggested.At least it gives a good background."
5,The clue to the prophetic puzzle.,"Despite the outright biases declared against this book, truth is, the Roman church still seem to fit the sterotype of a prostituted Christian church that St. Paul describes as 'Apostate'. Any doctrine that is not supported by the bible whether by Catholics or Protestants alike are plain and simple apostasy. The only way out of apostacy is for the Roman Catholic church to abandon its pagan traditions, focus on Christ alone, repent and go back to the bible as the sole authority in Christian faith, obey God rather than man. Otherwise, true Christian believers from the Catholic fold should leave this religious system and heed Apocalypse chapter 18, God's call 'Come out of her My people'. Many of the Catholics are true Christians in faith. Please understand that this statement is a call for the Roman church to reform and not against the individual Catholic faithfuls. We are individually accountable to God, and not by our religious affiliation."
3,A Good book...,I thought this was good. I want to say Excellent but I have to b honest. The first 200 or so pages were in my opinion rather harsh(i.e. an unfair lashing at catholics) but it then mellows out. Overall the info is correct and really answered alot of questions I had.
3,This Book Gets Close!,"I begin reading books of this nature because an author named Canyon Adams, who wrote 666 The Beast Revealed, first turned me on to how Christianity is the woman who rides the beast. After that book, I bought a couple dozen more, including this one. This author is very close, except for the fact that he points out how Catholicism only is the woman. Catholicism is PART of that woman, but Christianity, as other authors have pointed out, is the WHOLE woman. Good job, though. Thoughtful. Somewhat decently written. A bit weak in areas. But closer to the truth than some others I've read."
3,A Woman Rides the Beast,"Sheds some insight on the Catholic Church and its history, the Inquisition, and the priest sexual scandals. Rather heavy reading but ask the Holy Spirit to illuminate the truth to you if you read this book."
1,HOW ABOUT ZERO STARS?,"I read the the first 2 chapters of the book and skimmed throuth the rest. The title alone is very disturbing and made me very angry. There are many decent, hardworking Single Black Women out here like myself who do not play games and who yearn for a decent black man who knows how to treat and honor us. Black women today have a hard enough time out here just trying to make it through the day without some scorned black man like A. Marshall writing Black Trash like this. Many black men treat us bad enough, they certainly don't need to read ghetto garbage like this to influence them to act worse than many of them act already. I BEG EVERYONE WHO COMMES ACROSS THIS BOOK THAT DEGRADES BLACK WOMEN, DON'T BUY IT. DO NOT SUPPORT THIS BOOK. THE AUTHER DOES NOT DESERVE BLACK MONEY. HE DOES NOT RESPECT OR VALUE BLACK WOMEN. WE NEED A BOOK TO HEAL US. NOT FURTHER DIVIDE US."
1,Crap!,"Here's a person who has access to a powerful resources that reaches so many, instead of using that to heal, strenghten and enlighten our Brothers and Sisters he drives us further apart. It's pure sensationalism from a greedy, bitter, angry man.What I find disturbing is there are many men out there who takes this stuff seriously.No need to purchase the title and review says it all."
2,Arab Propaganda,"I don't like documentaries that refuse to give an accurate depiction of their subject matter and Tradgey in the Holy Land is as guilty of this as any I have seen. It is full of half truths that are convincing only when presented(as they are) out of context. Houston TX. is wrong in thinking this DVD represents anything more than Arab propaganda and to correct Tx. it is not a journalists job to make a ""DETERMINATION OF TRUTH"". However, their job is to gather and present all facts from all sides so the public is better informed. This dvd failed to do that."
4,Internal Diameters,"In case you need to prep your area ahead of time the daimeters of the holes are 4"" and 6"" and the full diameter is actually 15.5"". I wanted to put it under a light fixture but the internal diameter was a bit too small so you should should make sure where your light touches the ceiling is a little less than 6"". It is made of hard plastic so I wonder how well paint will stick to it, but thats a concern for the future since my ceiling is white. I find it a nice frugal add on if it goes with your room."
3,"An Interesting Read, But Too Uncertain","""William Shakespeare: His Life And Work"" is an attempt to integrate known facts about Shakespeare's life with his literary output. Although I found the information about his life to be interesting, the results are disappointing. I feel that, because of the sparse information about Shakespeare's life, Anthony Holden tries to infer too many details from his plays and poetry. I had hoped for a greater effort to explain Shakespeare's life and work through known facts of his era. This book makes for interesting reading, but it contains too much uncertainty for my taste."
1,dissapointed,The backs of the shoes keep folding down. You can therefore imagine why they are not at all comfortable.
5,Reggae in its Hey Day,"Once reggae was made popular by Bob Marley, there were, and still are, those who have tried to duplucate his message and sound. UB40 only kept the sound. By creating their own message, they were able to make their mark on popular music, yes popular. Though still considered Reggae, UB40 was and is enjoyed by those listening to it fot the first time not knowing what Reggae is. Higher Ground, and Promises and Lies are my two favorites. See if you can discover your own."
3,Good unit but a little short,"Not bad of a unit. Takes a bit of practice to make sure the chain doesn't get ragged on something in which it wont turn. My biggest beef though, is the pole portion is too short. I kept wishing for another 3-4 extra feet of extension which really helps with higher trees. Since the pole section is just a generic drive unit, I'm wondering if I can just purchase an additional pole. However, no info on this exists in the manual or manufacturer's web site.As for power, that of course depends on what type of trimmer motor is powering the unit. I have a Troy-Bilt 31cc 2 cycle and it has more than enough power -- I only had to use full throttle on the trunks, never on the thick branches since there was never a lack of power. The modulation of the throttle with the trimmer motor makes it wonderful to use."
5,Just what I have been wanting,"For several years, I have had a great string trimmer that takes EZ-Link attachments. I had been wishing there was a chain saw attachment for it, and then I found the Troy-Bilt 8"" saw on Amazon. It was a great purchase. It came promptly thank goodness, because I needed to prune some fruit trees before they began to leaf out. This chain saw made short work of the project. It allowed me to reach the top branches and shorten the trees to manageable size very easily. The saw worked great. It had plenty of cutting power. I love it."
4,8 inch- Add On Troy-Built Pole Saw Model PS72OR,"Having use it only a short time one afternoon , it preformed well . The saw seem`s to be fairly well made .I have No"" complaint`s with the saw it`s self. I Would How ever , like to know Who or where from , to but spair part`s for the saw .... Namely a spair chain for the thing , since I didn`t recive any book or paper work from the Troy - Built Co..... The people that built the piece of equipment . Can not find anything on Line about part`s for the saw , from TroyBuilt web site or other wise . Maybe the Troybuilt Co. Expect`s a person to just buy a whole new pole saw when this chain ware`s out or break`s ."
3,bore snake kit,"This bore snake kit is good but is not the one pictured. The on in the picture has a hard carrying case. The one i received came with a clothe carrying case. Don't get me wrong it's nice and everything else came with it too. The bore snake, gun oil, powder blaster and cleaning clothes. I was just dissapointed not getting what was pictured. The hard case would have been nice for taking it with to the range. Also the same kit i got you can find for less money through other retailers on amazon, but i decided to pay a little more for the hard case. I guess I learned my lesson."
4,A gripping story... even if a few things don't add up,"Blood Enemy is a gripping, Tristan and Isolde-like story about Lucian (a werewolf slave of the vampires) and Sonja (vampire and daughter of vampire elder Viktor). Once I started reading, I couldn't put it down, though I was a bit disappointed to discover that Selene doesn't make much of an appearance in this story. The only problem is that this story was obviously written before Underworld: Evolution, and as a result a number of things didn't add up. Marcus makes an appearance, and his character doesn't agree with that of Evolution, among other things. But, keeping in mind that the author was not privy to details of the future movie, it's a great story - I highly recommend it to all Underworld fans."
3,"great collection, ruined by atrocious subtitles","The series is great. a must but for all, but only if you do not intend to turn on the subtitles. they are absolutely pathetic.The people who did it had no idea what they were up to and have ruined such a beautiful dvd. They have not even bothered to read the stories before sub titling it. example Mr. Jabez Wilson is typed as Jay Beards Wilson and game of whist is shown as whiskey. and hundreds of such other errors which really need to be rectified in future editions."
2,Review of Adventures of Sherlock,All the discs worked except the 1st disc. It was 2-sided and neither side would play. I exchanged the boxed setfor a replacement. The replacement had the same problem.
3,The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes (Boxed Set Collection),"I view DVDs on my computer screen. The first DVD, which is a double-sided DVD, doesn't play at all on my computer. I called MPI, the manufacturer and they told me that they realize that a few psople are not going to have any success. MPI told me they might get around to rectifying the problem, but don't hold your breath. The other 3 DVDs in the package are just fine."
4,solid but not stellar,"Having read the many rave reviews of Brett being the best Holmes ever, I didn't share those opinions.This series is much truer to the books but in terms of interest in the Holmes character, I found Basil Rathbone as Holmes to be much more compelling and with a better script to work with.I did prefer this series Watson character however."
5,Sherlock Holmes at His Best,"Could Sir Conan Doyle have envisioned the perfect man to play the part of Sherlock Holmes? I believe he would be delighted with Jeremy Brett. This production of the Sherlock Holmes Stories is quite remarkable and ahead of its time in its use of special effects. I was truly amazed that these shows were filmed in the 1980's. You will not be disappointed, every episode a gem."
4,Nice guide to beautiful walks in paradise,"Walking in Mallorca is a great traveling book for Mallorcan visitors. Although I was unable to travel ALL of the recommended trails, many of the suggestions - particularly some in the North near Deia - were wonderful finds. The book makes much more sense once you get there and get a good feel for the island. I read the book in advance and was very confused about how or what to do -- once you are there (and in car, preferably) the walks all just work themselves out. I only wish the book had colour plates of more walks, etc. The ratings and descriptions of the trails were accurate at the time I explored using this book (2002/2004)."
3,A little skimpy and unfulfilling,"Two historians take a new look at the final days of Russia's Tsar Nicholas II and his family, using new information that has come to light since the exhumation of their hidden bodies. Much of what has been written about the assassinations of the Romanovs is inaccurate, according to King and Wilson, who provide details that are graphic and at times gruesome. ""Two generations have passed since the Ekaterinburg murders,"" write the authors. ""Yet somehow, the events of that night, and its victims, stand at the forefront of public interest."" There is no doubt that fascination in this tragic family will continue for time to come. Say King and Wilson: ""Perversely, in death, the once-despised emperor and his family have become all things to all people, embodying romance, sentiment, nostalgia, national pride, religion, and myth. This is the true fate of the Romanovs."" But their own research is frustratingly incomplete and begs more questions than it answers."
1,"More of the same, rehashed from other books","I was very disappointed with this book. Everything that is contained in this book is found in ""The Lost Princess"" by James Blair Lovell, ""Anastasia"" by Peter Kurth and a host of other ""tabloid trash bios"" written on the Romanovs. The evidence has been proven repeatedly by TRUE scholars and historians time and time again so why twist the truth with nonsense that the Imperial family survived? Ah, the old greenback no doubt. The book offers nothing concrete and I doubt very much that the authors researched any Russian archives. It is a disappointing fairy tale to say the least so save your pennies or buy a copy of Grimm's Fairy Tales as you will find more truth in that. It is a load of rubbish!"
1,More nonsense about the Imperial Family,"I was very disappointed with this book. Everything that is contained in this book is found in ""The Lost Princess"" by James Blair Lovell, ""Anastasia"" by Peter Kurth and a host of other ""tabloid trash bios"" written on the Romanovs. The evidence has been proven repeatedly by TRUE scholars and historians time and time again so why twist the truth with nonsense that the Imperial family survived? Ah, the old greenback no doubt. The book offers nothing concrete and I doubt very much that the authors researched any Russian archives. It is a disappointing fairy tale to say the least. Furthermore, I simply cannot believe that the authors have the audacity to coin themselves as ""historians"" and ""experts"". That is like saying that the papparazzi who hunted down Princess Diana were ""journalists"". The book is nothing but a load of rubbish and deserves to end up in the remainder bins of Barnes and Noble!"
1,Waste of time.,"These boxes are a waste of time. They were delivered in two halves of cardboard boxes hastily taped together without any kind of secure holding materials, thus they were torn and scratched up quite severely. Once I got them home I realized the boxes don't fold together properly. By the time I did get them folded together they were mangled beyond use: large gaps in the seams, rumpled material, warped sides, etc. Add to this the intense static cling that sucks up any bit of dust or strand of hair in a twelve mile radius, it's just not worth the time or money. Head to a local comic shop and purchase pre-constructed boxes for much cheaper."
2,"Title should read ""Using Red Hat Linux""","I have mixed feelings about this publication. I have Red Linux 5.1 installed on my system, so much of the material outlined in the book was relevant to the questions I had about installation set-up and configuration. However, the book seemed to be missing detailed information on internet access configuration. The book had a couple of chapters dedicated to the topic but after following the text I could not get Linux to dial-up my ISP. So if the examples in the book don't work for your particular situation, you are out of luck."
5,"Acessible, Readable","I needed to write a whole paper overnight on globalization and the environment and just picked this book up at the store the day before. It's very readable, with ideas that are easily accessible; most of which are thoughts that probably have had crossed your mind before; you just needed someone to logically link them all together and prove them for you.makes for very compulsive reading."
2,Dr King&JFK hold it down,the rest are weak.I don't care&never cared to hear what Reagan had to say ever.Dr.King is still a Force that hasn't been touched yet.JFK was cool as a Speaker if nothing else.
1,"The Evil Empire speech without the ""evil empire""","I bought this in order to hear Ronald Reagan's ""evil empire"" speech. However, in spite of the fact that ""evil empire"" is quoted on the back of the DVD's cover, one never actually gets to hear Reagan utter the phrase that shook the Soviet apparat. Instead, his speech to the National Association of Evangelicals is inexplicably cut off after he refers to the Soviet Union as ""the focus of evil in the modern world"" - some three paragraphs BEFORE one would have heard him implore his audience not to ignore ""the facts of history and the aggressive impulses of an evil empire"". Talk about ""Hamlet"" without the Prince. Irritating, to say the least . . ."
5,Pick your own disease,"I got each family member a microbe for their own most-memorable ailment. For me, lyme disease, since I had it twice. It's a fun way to mock that which only makes us stronger!"
2,Re-hash of plans from the 1930's,"The copyright on the book is misleading. What you find out once you've bought it, is that the house plans date to the authors' book from the 1930's, as the style of the illustrations clearly indicates. The plans are small and dated, with none of the architectural and building ideas developed in the next 70 years of the 20th century! A waste of money."
4,The Resident Patient,This was a strange one. I didn't see the way the story line was going. That is unusual for me. I usually can figure out the story line prior to the turn where it is spelled out for you.
4,Good turntable for the price...,"This is a good turntable if you are on a low budget. If you have a little more money...buy something that will last longer. This isn't made for heavy use, but if you just want a turntable to screw around with, this is the one. This turntable has to be kept CLEAN for it to sound good. If you have the money, I would suggest getting something that would last longer."
4,"Another good horror novel from Gary Brandner. It's short, inventive, lean, and fast-moving.","This book is about a young woman who drowns in a pool, has a near-death experience, and gets revived by an off-duty doctor who lives in the nearest apartment building.After dancing for hours, she gets severe muscle cramps while swimming in the pool. (The book makes it seem like she got her swimmer's cramps because she ate right before swimming, but all eating would do is give you an abdomenal cramp, not a leg cramp.)She goes under, loses consciousness, and drowns. She's technically dead for a short time, but either through her will to live or through the CPR of a doctor, she comes back.While she was dead, she felt the pull of a dark entity and the presence of many lost souls.The entity believes that she should have stayed dead and sends a series of emissaries to kill her. They are the reanimated corpses of the recently dead (the 'walkers' of the title)."
3,Is that all right?,"This album was released over three years after Roy Orbison died. It consists mostly of material he was working on at the time of his death, some of which was unfinished. So, they went ahead and finished the songs without him. But they still didn't quite have enough material, so they reused his old hit ""Crying"" (the duet version with k.d. lang from aJon Cryer movie) and ""Careless Heart"" from theMystery Girlalbum. But those songs were great in the first place, so it's nice to hear them again. Most of the other songs on the album are good, but a few fall a little flat. My personal favorite is ""I Drove All Night"" (which previously was a hit for Cyndi Lauper). Roy's fans should enjoy this album."
3,Has its limits.,I need more detail.Made me realize I don't have the strength to build it.For the experienced person only
2,kept collapsing!!,"My 51/2 year old son was so excited to get this toy for Christmas--but what a dissapointment for me. I spent a long time putting it together and then as soon as he plays with it, if one peice pops off during a sword fight--and he tries to fix it the whole floor collapses. Then to fix the floor you have to unhook the base--and the other floors collapse---AUGHHH what a HUGE frustration. HE was constanly trying to rebuild a heap of peices. We got the pirate ship too--and it was GREAT!!! It was more sturdy--still lots of building options and details--but you could actually play with it--move it around and stuff without having it all tumble apart. The castle has so much fun detail--but it is not usuable for play--not sturdy enough!"
5,Imagination at work!,"My boys ages 4 and 6 have had a blast with this set. Not hard to put together and built reasonably well. The boys play Battle then Dragon Family for 1-2 hours at a time without fighting. Interestingly, they are not fine motor kids and I wasn't sure if they would play with this set. It stays together and the accessory pieces are small but not tiny. The battery operated component is good for some excitement, but it isn't the primary focus of the set. The video is a nice jump start to get the imagination rolling. Overall, well worth the money, even for active boys like mine."
1,Save your money!!!,this toy is a piece of junk. It falls apart easily and literally takes at least 45 minutes to put back together. By the time the child is old enough to put it together they will be too old to play with it. My son wants to play with it but cries when it falls apart. It is a huge headache for me. I finally put the whole heap in a box and hid it. Some Christmas present huh. The testing and marketing team for this toy should be fired! Save your money!!!
1,nightmare putting together,This toy was a nightmare to put together. The kids are having fun with it though!
2,It won't stay together,"We got this set for my 4 year old son for Christmas. His eyes lit up when he saw it. He dropped everything and insisted that we open it right away....we didn't, of course...we waited a whole day...thank goodness...it literally took an hour to put together. There are so many pieces that look alike but are barely different. It was very frustrating...then it wouldn't stay together once it was finished. It has been nothing but a frustration for him and me ever since. He gets so upset when he tries to play with it. We saved the box. It's going back, if they will take it...."
5,Batteries Required,My sons 3 and 6 have enjoyed playing with other imaginext toys. This one was the best according to my 6 year old. One of the things that I have always liked about the imaginext toys is that there are no batteries required and the sets can be built together with previous sets. Unfortunately this set does require batteries. This is the first one that we got with batteries. Despite this the set is very cool with neat little surprises. The dragon is nice because it provides a rapid fire weapon for the boys battle scenes. We have not had difficulty with assembly as other reviewers. Also the sets have been durable. The nice thing is that you can put it together differently to make it more sturdy if the default design doesn't work for you. It just takes a little creativity.
3,Another Good Daniel Craig Performance,"This is a strange movie indeed. Although it is marred by a story line that is hard to follow, the film is redeemed ultimately by the acting of both Greta Scacchi (Agnes MacDonnell) who at times resembles Emma Thompson and Daniel Craig who plays a character named James Lynchehaun. Much of the action takes place in Ireland in 1896 and indeed is about both love and rage. MacDonnell, a well-to-do restless woman has a torrid but ultimately devastating affair with Lynchehaun, a passionate man beneath her station.The plot has many strange and unlikely twists and turns; the print-- at least in the DVD I rented-- is almost impossible to read; and the film needed a better editor. On a positive note, however, in addition to the fine acting by Scacchi and Craig, the scenery is exquisitely photographed and a joy to behold."
1,Extraordinary,"Has anyone noticed how Chopin has copied Michael Nyman's score for The Piano in his Piano Sonata No.3 in B minor, Op.58, Largo? Someone had better tell Nyman."
5,Very helpful,This pump has been very helpful at getting the water off of our pool cover. It is very quick and efficient. I was skeptical when my husband suggested it. Very happy with purchase and would recommend to a friend.
5,only used it once to empty my above ground pool,Worked fine to get the last foot of water out of my above ground pool. Only used it one season so we will see what happens next year.
1,This book sounds like 70s material,"I thought this book was terrible. The hero is a jerk, the heroine is a fool, and the plot made little, if any, sense. Many of the scenes were contrived and left me thinking I was reading a romance novel from the 70s. Beating women, forced sex, you name it, it's here. I'm looking for a little more escapist fiction than this novel offers."
5,Totally 80s,"I actually owned this ""tape"" before and loved it till I broke it. I was excited to find it here on amazon.com and bought it up! Totally takes me back to my younger days."
1,"The ad headline says 1000mg, but....","...the bottle says 750 mg. Which do YOU think is telling the truth? Never, EVER buy a health supplement that does not accurately list the potency."
5,This book is a Godsend,Our family used this book as a manual during the last 6 months of our father's life. We had never been through this process and did not really know what to expect. This book detailed everything for us and gave us insight into what our father was experiencing. I cannot tell you how valuable a guide it was and I heartily recommend it to everyone who is facing a similar situation. I have bought more than one copy to give to others because it was so central to our comprehension of the dying process. It also helped to eliminate a lot of fear that otherwise might have dominated us. Do not hesitate to buy this book if you or a loved one are caring for someone who is nearing death. I will forever be grateful that a dear friend gave it to us at our time of need.
1,Shirley MacLaine's Best Movie?,This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The characters are unlikeable except for Charity's two friends. The songs are far too long and I had to fast forward through most of them because they were so dull. I was especially disappointed with Big Spender because I love the song and expected a spectacular dance number from Bob Fosse and all they did was stand there draped over the bar. The only redeeming factor was that Sammy Davis Jr. was in it. He's awesome even though the song was fairly stupid. This was my first Shirley MacLaine film and on the back it said that Sweet Charity was her best movie. I have no desire to see her other movies then.
3,"GREAT NUMBERS, BORING STORY","Boy, what great songs and even musical sequences! But, yegads, is this a boring story! Prostitute with a heart of gold seeks Mr. Right in a city of Mr. Wrongs (gee, I wonder what happens eventually; then when THAT happens, I wonder what happens again--ZZZZZZZZ. As you can figure out, nothing all that unpredictable). You'll enjoy the numbers, but be bored to tears by the action. Rent it, then get the soundtrack or original broadway recording for the great songs."
2,For Serious Fosse Fans Only,"Ok, this movie is a clunker. The story doesn't hold up well in today's feminist or post-feminist era and MacLaine's performance made me cringe.However, here's the great thing about DVD: use the scene selector to skip right to the fabulous dance numbers! ""Rich Man's Frug"" and ""Hey Big Spender"" are two of Fosse's best on film, and big enough that you'll want to watch them several times to catch all the details and dancers. And as a special treat to Fosse fans, the extras on the DVD include some brief segments with THE MAN himself.Fosse newbies, skip right over this and go straight to CABARET which is a brilliant musical AND a brilliant film."
1,Junk,This charger is complete junk. I had two that lasted a very short time with minimal use. One about a month and the other a couple months.
4,Elissa sings as well as she looks,"Easy listening pop and dance music with a strong beat. Elissa has a young and pleasant voice. I don't understand a word of her songs but that doesn't matter, it's fun and youthful all the way through. The album is something of a classic in its style. The CD comes with a booklet giving the song lyrics in Arabic as well as Spanish for one of the tracks."
3,volume control?,It a great toy but boy they should have included a volume control! The cat doesn't care that it keeps making the same noise over and over and over but it can drive Mom nuts!
3,Credit where credit is due.,This Album gives no credit to one of the finest Flute Players in the group. Wachan Bajiyoperk played on this album but Gerald has failed to creit him. Beeatiful music tarnished by bad mojo.J B Roberson
2,Annoying Interviewer,"The interviewer is very annoying. At times he interrupted Jerry's answers, finished Jerry's sentences and blabbed on about his own ideas."
4,"a ""page turner"" but a disappointing ending","Even though I really enjoyed reading ""This Never Happened"" (after reading the other reviews, it made it all the more interesting to find that it was based on truth) I was disappointed with the ending....almost as disappointed as ""Bev"" when ""Jack"" didn't hit ""Richard"" when he confronted his father with the past. Ms. Summers built my hopes up that the devil was going to get his due, but actually got off easy. Even though I am not a fan of sequels or prequels, I can't help but wonder what was the basis for Jack's behavior, and whether or not that would make for good reading. A fast-paced book, I felt it did develop the characters enough to keep you wondering while reading, and tied them altogether in the end. But the ending for ""Richard"" was tied together in too neat a package....the parents got off too easy with that ending."
4,Japanese Decoration,I am interested in Japanese culture and and this wall fan makes a nice addition to our home decor. I would highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys anything Asian.
3,Laboriously tortured English,"While the concepts in this book are edifying, the language in which it is written is, at times, almost incomprehensible. One wonders whether the author first wrote this in German and then translated it into English, and then while translating added parenthetical asides that hadn't occurred to him in the original writing."
4,Its a Poly flag,"My child's interest in video games has given him respect for the japanese culture. Oh, and he likes sushi and miso soup too. What more can you say about a flag? It seems well made."
2,"Extravagance of Co-singers, rather than a profound album","This album has some exceptional works, but with an excessive quantity of co-singers. Greatest Hits I and II displayed the authoritative greatest hits of Queen's career, but this seems to be a memory tribunal of Queen's lead singer, Freddie Mercury.Most of this album's songs exuberate a competition of Queen co-singers, rather than an aggregation of Queen's musical exemplars.Another weakness rests in the re-mixes. The majority would rather hear the original masterpieces that altered music's footsteps than some modernistic amalgamation created by some other than Queen. My endorsement reclines with the inaugural duo of Greatest Hits."
3,A fitting epilogue,"Queen had enough material for a 'Greatest Hits III' without dipping into Freddie and Brian's solo catologue and it is disapointing they did not inc.. 'A Winter's Tale' however it is a fitting and cohesive final volume in the 'Greatest Hits' albums, with classics like 'You Don't Fool Me', and 'These Are The Days Of Our Lives'"
4,Thank God It's Queen!,"This album is better than I expected it to be. The only songs I don't like are the remixes of ""Another 1 Bites the Dust"" and ""Under Pressure"". It includes 3 of the best songs from Made in Heaven ""Too Much Love..."", ""Let Me Live"", and ""Heaven for Everyone"" (the liner notes are great, too!). I'm glad ""Princes of the Universe"" and ""Las Palabras"" were included. Add to that Freddie's ""The Great Pretender"", the beautiful ""Barcelona"", Brian's ""Driven by You"" and the poignant ""No One But You"" (which Brian co-sung with Roger) and you've really got a One of a Kind collection. Too bad they didn't include any of Roger's solo stuff or a song from the Cross. Also featured are collaborations with Elton John and David Bowie (from the Concert for Life). The final song ""Thank God It's Christmas"" ends the set perfectly, since after all Christmas is coming as I write this review (this rare song was originally found on the now out-of-print The Collection)."
3,SuperGoo 1.5,"I found it irritating that the brush and effects palettes could not be moved out of the way. They sit right on the picture when you're using them instead of staying off to the side or something. The reset only works for the most recent step - you can't undo multiple steps. It can be fun once you get the hang of it, but the directions could be better. I would recommend getting ScanSoft's PhotoFactory instead simply because you get two more programs plus the SuperGoo. It doesn't cost significantly more than the SuperGoo alone. ""More bang for the buck""."
5,Music of the Angels CD,"I put this CD in my clock radio aside of my bed. When I can't sleep at night I listen to the calming sounds of the harp, flute and soothing voices. I usually do not make it to the end of the CD before I fall asleep."
2,"Uh, not very accurate historically","Hmmm. This production omits that it was Richard II's gay relationship with De Vere that mainly caused the nobles' uprising against him. It even missed the significance of Richard placing what was basically a wedding ring on De Vere's finger after De Vere had died. That was the one episode I watched, figuring if it was that inaccurate (or, one fears, ""sanitized for your protection""), then the rest was probably likewise skewed toward glib simplifications and recastings. Such a rich history. Such a shame not to tell it with less ""editing."" You can't fit 20 years in one show, but given how much the episode harped on De Vere and how jealous the others were of his influence with the king, uh, well. Most historians accept this view, so even if you didn't, it seems like you might at least state, uh, well, ""most historians accept this view."""
2,Poor range,"After couple of years with this phone I can honestly say that this phone has great potential to be excellent phone if only Uniden fixes two major problems:1. Poor range2. Low battery capacityThe good thing about this phone is that it has very good sound quality (when in range), it has a lot of features, good display and a great design."
1,Worst and Lowest from Sabina. Normal for Fito,"Sabina's outstanding carreer has been almost desecrated with this record. After the last concert, I was concerned on the health of Juaco, but now I am sure that he can't die after this major mistake. Sabina has to create something great to make up for this disaster. Forced lirics and the disonant Fito makes this ""Enemigos Intimos"" an ironic truth, they really should be. I am just so sad and disappointed that I mailed my CD back to the producers, could not give less than 1 star because of this program, but if I could I would give 0. Juaco, fuera de caracter, y verdaderamente como pez fuera del agua junto con ""Fito"". Craso error comprar esto."
1,got know where,"This book was so boring it went know where. Every chapter was the same. Dr. Joni Forest was the acting administrator this major Baltimore ER, all she wanted to do was show the board of director that she was a better administrator then the former head, Dr. Don Rivers who left to started a private practice in Greece and now is back, challenging Joni's leadership. There are know sparks fling or passion. This was a boring book."
5,wooooooooo,This book is one of the best books of 2005. It has a great storyline and is full of action. When the movie comes out I look forward to seeing it. Greg Cox wrote a fantastic book version of the movie and I praise him for that. I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys the underworld series of books. This one takes the cake. I will not spoil it for anyone expect that Selene and Michael become closer and the action is bigger and more exciting.
5,"Good dirt, and funny anecdotes!","I liked this book a lot. It's been buried in Amazon's Business section when it's really a social history. There's some great dirt in here, especially about how pissed off catalogue employees were when 9,000 of them got the axe in one day in 1976. My dad was one of them. Loved the Buyer's chapter and didn't know that Eaton's employees actually lost their lives on the Titanic, Athenia, and Lusitania. And the description of how Eaton's Japanese employees scrambled to protect the contents of the Eaton's buying office safe after the 1923 Yokohama earthquake levelled the buying office, is wild. The war chapter is also amazing. Certainly proves that not everyone loved each other among the Eaton family behind the family! Funny stuff about Santa too.All in all a great read! Highly recommended. Pictures are a great touch. Phenix has a nice ascerbic style at times; writes like a man. But her picture on the dustjacket certainly proves she isn't one! (little sexism here, ha!)"
2,Boy was I dissapointed,"When I saw this movie in the store I was very excited. I thought it looked great. But after purchasing I was reminded to never judge a Book(or in this case an Anime) by it's cover. The story line was short and confusing with the first episode consisting only of flash backs and flash forwards. The plot was almost nonexistent, what little plot there was came across as a jerky halfhearted Evangelion copy without any of the redeeming features. The sound effects were poor and the action scenes while animated well made up less than 10 minutes of the 90 minute run time.Over all this is definately a DVD to rent and not buy. Or if you can't find someplace to rent it you should fell glad you won't be tempted to waste a portion of your life. If you feel the need to occupy 90 minutes of your time you would be better suited to watch the dust on your TV screen and try to decide if it affects the sound quality for 90 minutes."
1,Broke & Pukin',"The editors consored my first review of this disk, so I'll TRY to dress it up. I have been a fan of Hank Sr. and Hank Jr. for years. I saw III's disk and decided to give him a listen purely based on his ancestry. Oh well, here is where it get's hard to clean up my thoughts. I have wasted money on disks in the past and will undoubtedly do so again. If this isn't the biggest disappointment it is darn sure a close second. Nah-it's the biggest. I can listen to Granpa Jones and Jimmy Rodgers with more enjoyment. III sounds worse than the worst amature I've EVER heard. There may be other material he sounds better on, but this AIN'T it!!..."
5,Awesome speakers!,"This is one of my favorite speakers. The sound is smooth and clear. Obviously, you would need to buy a subwoofer for the bass. I bought my seven years ago and it is still working flawlessly.Highly recommended."
1,You've got to be kidding,"If guys actually read this book and think they can get away with what the author was saying, they are fooling themselves. If the author believes his strategy actually would work, he has a lesson to learn. Women are not that stupid. The more and more I read, I felt sorry for the author because he obviously was the narrator despite his opening remarks that he wasn't. It's fine to date more than 1 woman at a time, but be a man about it. The saddest part is, every guy I know who read this book, thought it was ridiculous so don't bother with a sequel."
3,3 stars/nice fragrance/defective bottle,"The fragrance was lovely, and was received in a timely manner. However, after only a couple of uses, the tiny stopper on top of the bottle broke off into the bottle. I notified the company of this, and they defended the product by stating that I may have been too forceful in trying to open the bottle. The stopper is so tiny, that it's difficult to get a good grip on the thing in order to open it. I don't believe I was too forceful; I believe the stopper should have a more manageable top portion, for ease of opening. The company did refund me $3.00, which I applied towards a new bottle of fragrance."
4,"Nice, but not quite as functional as expected","It is a good buy and is made of heavy duty plastic, but there is no movement/feature underneath to direct air straight up or in a certain direction. The only movable piece shuts air flow, rather than directing it. As long as you are okay with it blowing straight up, it is a good option."
3,"Ok, but no pictures","The book sounded great after reading the description, but after I purchased it and it was delivered, I was soooo disappointed it had NO PICTURES in it. I am a cook that LOVES to have pictures in her cookbook. Sorry, had to return this book."
4,"Good author, good read, satisfying...","If you want something to quench your romance thirst on a lonely Wednesday night this is it. I've always liked Elizbeth Lowell's books and this one didn't let me down. The heroine, Raine is a woman with that hint of vulnerability that makes you root for her and the man who can make her believe. Boy, is Cord the man. Sigh. The love scenes are hot, hot, hot. Did I mention they're hot? One of Ms. Lowell's best I think. I didn't give it the complete 5 star because the ending left me a little miffed, but I guess, neverthless, it was a happy ending. The best kind."
2,yeah this isnt a good hits album...,"all of the songs on this album are very good, however it doesn't live up to standards. sublimes a much better band than this album shows. if your a casual fan, i would not recomoned this to start. instead, i'd recomend ""40 oz. to Freedom"" thats my personal favorite Sublime album. it may not have all the hits on it, but is much better than robbin the hood and self-titled. great songs, terrible compilation"
2,How About Somebody makes a REAL Sublime Greatest Hits CD,"Sublime is one of the best bands of all time, and to make a Greatest Hits album that only features 10 songs is a disgrace. There are so many Sublime songs left off this album that it is even hard to begin. They left off great songs such as Same in the End, April 29 1992, Waiting for my Ruca, and Dont Push, but that is not all. I am an owner of all 6 sublime albums (2nd Hand Smoke, Self-Titled, 40 oz., Robbin Da Hood, Acoustic, and Stand by your Van) and there were so many tracks that were great songs but were not as well-known but should definitely make any compilation of their best songs such as Pawn Shop, Ballad of Johnny Butt, Caress me Down, Were Only Gonna die from our own Arrogance, and Rivers of Babylon.I think somebody should make a real Sublime CD to truly showcase all of their great songs, not just the 10 biggest radio hits.(...)"
3,DIE HARD SUBLIME FAN!,"I have seven of sublime's c.d.'s (40oz.,robbin the hood,self titled, second hand smoke,live,acoustic,greatest hits.) They are my favorite band and all but this album was a disappointment. It did not have very good songs on it if you ask me. Why was it only 10 songs long? Heres an idea for the future, how about a c.d. with only the rare tracks that are only on the bootleg albums?"
1,dissappointing,"Dont get me wrong... I LOVE Sublime, but this cd is terrible. Sure it has good songs on it but damn. You miss out on songs like April 26, 1992, Caress me Down, Pawn Shop, Garden Grove, and many others. I agree that this CD just capitolizes on Brad's death and that it wrong. Just like all that Princess Di bull$|-|it. It's completely horrible. I am glad that they didn't do that to Kurt Cobain and I hope they never do. Speaking of (this is for all you Nirvana fans) Dave Grohl and Kris Novoselic finally beat the system (Cortney Love) and are releasing the Nirvana box set which will include a new album of material that the band had record prior to Kurts death and Cortney stopped from being released, until now. Buy it. Anyway, if you were even THINKING about this CD, don't, but the S/T or 40 Oz. to Freedom instead. They're both much better."
3,The way a teenager thinks,"I fell in love with sublime when i hung out with my brother Mike. He and his friend Joel used to play Sublime songs on the gurata...Cant spell. I loved sublime after that and they are the best band out there now and forever. Bradley voice is smooth and he can sing with such a strong voice yet with such passion and heart... i will always love sublime and even though i never even heard of his death when it happen, i still feel alot of greef that i never got to see him on tv or hear a new song by him... i wish the best for Bradley Noel and all his friends and family. Love Melissa Fellows"
5,Vampire Princess Miyu (TV Vol. 5) a great disc.,"""Vampire Princess Miyu"" the TV series is no longer in print and hard to find. The entire series is a classic and as such all the volumes (including this one - Vol. 5) are neccessary to get the complete intensity and understanding of the series. I highly recommend this DVD vol. 5 of ""Vampire Princess Miyu"" as a part of the total series but not as a stand alone DVD."
2,Useless,Can't see the point in these. No redeemable qualities or reason for purchase that I can surmise.
5,Wow,"Abby is the best series character I have read about in the longest time! Her books give me somthing to do over the summer, not only reading it but thinking about too. I get lots of fun ideas. I recamend this book to girls who need to think of a plan to solve a problem or for fun!"
3,for younger girls,"I'm a middle-schooler and i decided to pick up ""EVERY CLOUD HAS A SILVER LINING."" Being a writer myself, i did enjoy it somewhat. But if you would like to purchase this book, I'd suggest buy it for 3-5th grade readers. This book was too easy for me and very predictable."
3,halve-halve,"I've read this book about 2 times none stop. but I sort of had to stop and think, what is this book about. All I see was introductions and she making friends, she likes to do this, that, all. but on the other hand, this is the first book. author that are good have to introduce their characters. So oh yeah, this is a great book but I can't decide I like it or not. I had read some more books after this and I decided I like this serie. So I think you can't really judge the serie by reading just one book. books will improve like you."
5,Great product for great price,I just love these Kodak Kits. it has everything basic things you need not more not less. and of course can't beat the price in Amazon.
5,My Review,"I got this kit for the Kodak C330 camera and it work great. I can carry my camera, 2 memory cards, 2 extra batteries, and the charger all in the camera bag that came with this kit. The charger breaks down(the prongs come off the back) for east storage in the bottom compartment of the bag with the push of a button. It's great and the batteries and charger work with the c series cameras too."
4,My opinion on After the Dancing Days,"After the Dancing Days is about a girl who is dealing with the death of her uncle,the war, and her father being away helping the doctors at war. When her father finally arrives, her life starts to change. She cannot stop thinking about all of the wounded soldiers. As the weeks go by she learns to manage her thoughts and keep up with her ever-changing life.I loved After the dancing Days. It was very interesting to see a girl about my age going through so much and handling it so well. It is also very inspiring to me because of the fact that she is so strong spiritually and emotionally.The war brought a great deal of depression to the family,not to mention the rest of the country. When everything starts to get worse,she loses a good friend who helped her through the whole time. I thought the book was really good and great for anyone who likes to read."
3,Guide unread,Haven't had time to read it. It WAS poorly packed and the cover and some pages were folded back.
4,Great attachment!!,"I have a Ryobi powerhead attached to my cultivator. It works great. I have a small planter 3'X 35' that I got it for. I was impressed at the job it does. I expected a power hoe, but this will turn soil. The only drawback is the clearance between the blades and cover. I got a small rock wedged. The blades are easy enough to pull the pins to release the pressure. They are held to the shaft with pins and spring clip cotter pins. It is a little heavy, but that is good for tilling, less effort to keep it in the soil."
3,ok,"well,the idea was great,but the documentary is boring,dull,no excitement.it's a shame they didn't put rare tv footage of vampira,only a couple"
5,The best test tones!,"I was able to test my box and sub to the fullest extent, as well as tune my box to the best frequency for my car. I have many bass CDs, and this one is in the player the most! -Matt"
1,Don't buy this unit as it does not work out of the box...,"I would not recommend purchasing this unit (Troy Bilt Hedge Trimmer attachment Model TBAH). I have yet to be able to make it work properly (already returned 2 brand new units for exchange to place of purchase) and the hedge trimmer attachment AND my complete string trimmer are currently in the shop under warranty service waiting for back ordered parts (4 months so far). Troy Bilt Customer Service is of no help, they constantly quote company policy to avoid fixing their equipment. Even though it has a 1-year warranty, you will also not be able to find local service, as the list of warranty locations on the Troy Bilt site are 2-3 years out of date (try calling some of the dealers listed but be ready to hear all the bad things they have to say about Troy Bilt quality or lack of!). When this unit is finally working, I will sell it as soon as possible and buy a real quality hedge trimmer."
2,Failed,"I purchased this unit under the name of Troy-Bilt AH720R,and when i opened up the box, it was the Walmart brand of AH720.I had already tried this unit with various types of plants.Pay attention to what models you are getting from amazon !I had to return this paying the return shipping fee.I give this 2 stars because it will cut little shrubs and trees, but fails to cut grass.Instead it leave the grass rippled and torn.It should also receive a 1/2 star for its quality.My neighbor has that exact brand AH720 ( not Troy Bilt )and his broke within 2 months."
4,A good trimmer accessory,"I like this trimmer accessory, and it saves me from having to maintain a separate hedge trimmer. It works well, is easy to attach & remove, and stores nicely on my shed wall. The only drawback is that when compared to a standalone trimmer, the long extension of the gas-powered trimmer it attaches to makes it awkward to use in tight spaces. It works just fine, but it's about 3 feet of ""extra handle"" that you need to take into consideration. I'm still glad I bought it, but this took a little getting used to."
4,Very Interesting,"After reading this book, you will have an entirely new appreciation for the republican system. Note that ""republican"" does not refer to the political party.Everdell explains why a republic is the most just and fit governmental system for humanity. He also relates the traits of republicanism and signs of its demise. It's definitely worthwhile reading, but be aware that the language is very dense. You really need to be interested in the topic to get through it."
2,Great Music ... Poor Fidelity,"Don't get me wrong, Di Sarli is my favorite, and this is the workhe spent his life working toward and is most remembered for,but the producers of this anthology didn't do his music or theconsumer any favors when they added a ton of reverb to themusic on this CD.This music deserves better than hamfisted sound engineering,so I'm giving this CD 2 stars.If you want the best CD of late 50's Di Sarli instrumentals, Ihighly recommend the Solo Tango release or the RCA Victor100 Anos CD (neither yet on Amazon)."
4,Good Plot but ICG,"As a book it was a good read through and through. There were, however some major details of the story that were almost illogical. Antarctica may be the last place on Earth where things like this would go on, but Antarctica isn't a big war-zone for countries to break international bonds. This seemed like the last place on Earth Reilly could have used and still have it somewhat believable. The ICG might have crossed the line though. It would be like the government to try to keep things like this secret, but not many governments would go to the extent of killing their own armed forces. Although this seemed to hold the book back I still enjoyed the book. There was plenty of action in the book, which is an affect that most of the time makes a good book. I would recommend this to anyone who likes to read action-packed novels and anyone else who likes a good conspiracy theory."
1,Garbage,"This may not be the worst book I've ever read but it is definetly in the top ten. It is certainly the worst military/adventure style book ever. The author assumes the reader is either an idiot or five. Mr. Reilly attempts to write about many things from killer whales to the French equivalent of our SEALS but obviously knows nothing about any of his subject matter. Good military fiction is at least based in fact. This book is based in nothing but mindless drivle puncuated by ridiculous and unbelievable action. The author doesn't even bother to adher to basic physical laws. He has his characters getting the bends when they dive rather than when they surface, killer whales eating humans like packs of sharks (they don't), and a container of liquid nitrogen the size of a hand grenade instantly freezing thousands of gallons of water. This garbage isn't even good enough to be fantisy. I would give it negative stars if possible."
2,The average action novel. It qualifies for 2.5 stars,"A simple action thriller.Guns, Mediocre plot, The invincible action hero, a couple of good guys getting hurt, All the bad guys getting killed, Hero saving the day and getting the chick.You know the drill."
1,Less than palatable,In simple terms this is by far the worst book i have ever read. No question about it.Definitely my first and LAST Matthew Reilly book.
4,Wow! great book,The only problem you will have with this book is the pace. I finished this book so fast that I was at a loss and needed more! Good thing I found a copy of TEMPLE. I am a new Matt reilly fan and plan to read everything he puts out.
3,Hmmmm,"I read this book in a course of a day. As an action thriller it belts along at great pace but unfortuately as the book progresses such things as character development and realism trailing beind in a sorry heap which in my eyes to a certain extent lowered the overall book. Its worth reading however if you can suspend disbelief.Having also read the next book in this series, Area 7, that one proved to be more grounded in reality; mostly anyway and is well worth a read"
3,"Action, action, action... and a little more action.","Seriously, from the first page until the last - despite the story being a little drawn out - the action/adventure is excellent. The technical wizardry is top-shelf, and there is enough gunfire/death/deceit/weaponry/transport to keep the pages turning themselves. And on top of everything, it is simply a good story - which is what the reader intially picks the book up for."
1,Star Drek,"Imagine a book written by a hyperactive fourteen-year-old who flunked every class in science, math, history, biology and gym he ever took: that book would be an order of magnitude better than this one.One example: our hero decides to swim three miles to the Antartic Icecap. Worried that he might not make it (duh) he fashions a safty line by wrapping a steel cable, attached to a drum-winch, around his waist and swimming off. In the real world, the weight of the cable would have, of course, dragged him to the bottom within the first hundred feet.AVOID THIS BOOK! AVOID THIS AUTHOR!"
1,I Can't Believe this Got Printed!,"This started out to be a good book, but along about the time people started getting eaten by Killer Whales I began to have doubts. It wasn't too many pages after, when our trusty hero started wiping out British SAS forces left and right as he danced back and forth between racing hover craft, totally ignoring the laws of physics, that I just had to throw the book across the room. It became so UTTERLY impossible and stupid I just could not finish it. Don't waste your money, it is not even worth half a star."
1,Unpickupable,When I started reading this book my eyes went wide. I've never seen such a barbaric use of the English language. This book should be used as a school text as an example of how NOT to write. Why the inappropriate italics? Why the nicknames for every character? Could the characters be more one-dimensional? Could the story be more implausible? Has there been a worse use of syntax in the English language? The highlight for me was the author's publicity shot - check it out.
2,Disappointing,"A friend recommended this book, but I did not enjoy it. Yeah, had some exciting moments but if you enjoy your action that is close to being technically feasible then do not read this book. This went to extremes of unreality in delivering a lot of aspects which was quite a turn off."
1,Disappointing,"I had read Temple and enjoyed it so had great hopes for this one. My Dad tried to read it first and gave up after two chapters - I managed to finish but only by skipping large portions of the book. There are many glaring errors (killer whales that attack & eat people? A woman with a bit-off leg swimming for miles in salt water?) and WAY to much repetition, exclamation, etc. I would not recommend this book unless you are really feeling brainless and bored."
2,Disappointing,"I started this book with high hopes of a good read after hearing several reviews about it. I was quickly disappointed. Mr. Reilly obviously failed to research any part of the facts he alluded to. He presented the Orcas as man killers which they are not. He was totally wrong in his description of the Marine Corps, Ranks duties and mission. I don`t know about the scuba diving but it sounded very unlikely even to someone who has never dived. So far as sinking the sub all I can say is that is was so far out of the realm of possibility that it was laughable.I feel that when fiction draws on factual matter then the fistion should be made to fit the facts and not the other way around.Perhaps when Mr Reilly learns to research his subject material a little better he will be able to write a much better action novel. In the meantime I could not recommend this book to anyone."
4,"Non-stop, unbelievable action","This novel is one of those you have to take for what it is: pure action. There is little thought to plot credibility or much emphasis on characterzation. With that mindset, one has to give the author credit for producing a wild technothriller. Agreed that most of the events are completely unbelievable and the characters are mostly caricatures of the ""rambo type"" action hero, it is still a good, quickly read, entertaining book for those who like this type of story. If you are seeking intellectual gratification, this is not the book for you. If you like mindless adventure, constant action and indestructible good guys, then you will enjoy this book."
1,"Book title should be ""Banana Smoothies and Their Friends""","The authors' write, ""It's hard to imagine what smoothies would be without bananas."" I say ""TRY!"" Nearly half the 50 recipies in the book have banana in them, so unless you are a major banana fan (which clearly, I am not), I would pass on this one. I'm going to."
5,Very interesting book!!,"As the book says ""50 recipes"". they are all good!! I try almost every single one. I would recommend for everybody"
5,Red Velvet Cake,Great product. Very moist and flavorful. Purchased mine at my local Target store for .97 cents a box. Well worth the price.
4,Simply Irreplaceable,"Here's the reason for buying this collection - these are the original versions!Yes, this collection is wa-a-ay too short in both playing time & song selection. I mean, something purporting to be the best of Robert Palmer that is missing Simply Irresistible, is simply irresponsible. But at least what is here hasn't been remixed or rerecorded. I don't like it when artists or record companies want to mess with history. Since many of these 10 songs were hits, obviously a lot of folks liked them just the way they were. That's why I'm not pleased with both volumes of Addictions, or Anthology, or The Very Best Of, because many of the songs are remixed or as in the case of Addicted To Love, a whole different version that's neither the original single or album version.Come on, Island, stop trying to switch the originals for imitations. These great songs by Robert Palmer are simply irreplaceable."
5,A must-have on .NET remoting!,This books does not need a wordy review. It suffices to say that it was written for a wide range of audience---from novice to expert. The material is presented in an amazingly clear and understandable way for any reader.The best book on .NET Remoting by far!
4,Its a real gentle detergent,"Almost to gentle and you need to do the cleaning twice.A quick arrival, high quality buy, fantastic buy, would recommend to anyone. I will do buisness with these guys again."
5,gem cleaner,used this product on all my gold and diamonds and it worked great! came out clean and sparkly just like the day I first bought them thanks so much!
2,Disappointed - doesn't seem to make much of a difference,"I bought this to use in my Sonic Wave CD-2800 Ultrasonic Jewelry & Eyeglass Cleaner and it didn't seem to work any better than just water. I also tried cleaning my ring in just it, like the bottle suggested, and also didn't notice any difference. I was disappointed and will not be buying this again."
3,Skeptical...,"When I started looking for a good jewelry cleaning machine, I came across this one, and was unsure about these machines anyway, But I started to read the reviews and they sounded pretty good. So I went ahead and ordered it, received it quickly and tried it out right away. I thougt the little light would light up but it did not so this one must not have one, so did not know it was working at that time, Then I expected tiny little bubbles to occur in the water when turned on, there were no bubbles, so I was really unsure if it was working, So just waited til it was done with the time. When I took the rings out they did look cleaner, but I usually keep my stuff pretty clean anyway.. So as of right now, still a bit skeptical with it. I guess I need to get my rings real dirty and then try again..."
4,Great for jewelery,My rings and gemstones look wonderful! Lots of sparkle. Will need to reorder more product soon. Great product for use with sonic cleaner.
4,Well worth a listen.,"Rainy Day Music is a pleasing return from the Jayhawks, and a definite improvement upon the slightly disappointing Smile, their last album. It's an album full of quality songwriting, and is possibly their most accessible record yet, which should please both existing fans and newcomers alike. 'Stumbling Through the Dark', 'Tail Spin' and 'Eyes Of Sarahjane' are all great tunes with memorable melodies, something we have come to expect from the talented Gary Louris. Elsewhere Tim O'Reagan chips in nicely with the Lennon-esque 'Don't Let the World Get In Your Way', and 'Tampa To Tulsa'. As a whole, Rainy Day Music may not be quite as sublime as Hollywood Town Hall or Tomorrow The Green Grass but it still has it's fair share of winning hooks and lovely compositions. I'm just happy that this accomplished band is still making music."
5,"Good, straightforward acoustic rock.","It's been a long time since I heard a song on the radio that made me want to rush out and buy the CD. Then, on an alt-rock station in Northern California, I heard the Jayhawks' ""Save It For a Rainy Day,"" and said to myself, ""I must have this!"" I bought the CD, and although ""Save It For a Rainy Day"" is still my favorite song on it, I was delighted to hear that the rest of the CD was of the same quality. The jangly, country-tinged guitars and lovely melodies make this CD compulsive listening, as does Gary Louris' pure, sweet troubadour's voice. A must for anyone who likes rock music the way they used to make it!"
3,distortion on vocals,While the music on this release may be the Jayhawks best since Hollywood Town Hall the distortion on the vocals ruin it for me. My stereo system is very revealing thus exposing every wart. I have seen this distortion problem mentioned at other web sites so it seems I'm not the only one having a problem. I believe the engineers/producers turned up the levels on the vocals to the point of distortion. This vocal distortion is not a first for American Recordings as I also had the same problem with a Red Devils release.
4,a 2003 must,"this album is amazing, don't care what the others sayit is the essence of melody. This is one of the best albums of 2003 by far. I listen to a lot of music and work in a record store and this album could never get the recognition that it deserves. A must."
4,"""Where has this band been all my life?""","It's one of those times when you feel like an album was custom made just for you. The style, the lyrics, the ""autumn day"" feel of the whole thing. Each song is so well crafted, with a voice to match. I can easily say that 10 of these 14 songs are excellent, so I won't start naming them. If you're an old fan of the ""Byrds"", or ""C.S.N.Y."", and feel like bands don't make music the way they used to, pick this one up. Fans of ""Wilco"" and ""Ryan Adams"" should dig it too."
5,"An amazing, amazing album.","The timing of this album could not have been more perfect. I'm not talking about wartime. I'm talking about springtime. It is the perfect April album - all harmonies and depth and sadness and awe.Also, ""Save It For A Rainy Day"" may well be the best-written pop song I've heard in the past 5 years. If only pop radio understood that image isn't everything, these guys would be justifiably huge."
2,"Superficial Devotional, Poor Structure, Hard to Read Print","The book is very cheaply made and the print is difficult to read. I found many spelling and other grammatical errors in the devotional on just the first few pages. It seems to be heartfelt, but lacks substance. I also don't like that it is arranged Monday-Sunday, with a decotional on each day for 12 weeks. This forces you to start on Monday (which I did, even though I received the book on a Thursday and was anxious to begin then). The book is written by a single mom, but the arrangement and structure of the book is not good. Unfortunately, there's a lack of devotionals out there for single Christian moms. I would not recommend this, it is heartfelt but too superficial."
2,Not as good as Long Way to a New Land,"This is the follow-up book to ""Long Way to a New Land"" about an immigrant family coming to America in the 1800's. In this book, the family has arrived in New York and has to make their way to Minnesota without much English. It should have been a good book, and we're interested in the family, but the story was very chopped up. We probably won't read it again."
3,One of the cereal cups opened and oatmeal spilled inside the box,"They are very handy, however, the lids glue is not very good and one of them came off during shipping, spilling cereal throughout the box."
5,Get into your own head.,"Every person with a career should read this book. With simplegraphs and clinical psychology in layman terms, Wareham givesyou the tools to understand why you are where you are. Morethan that, you will understand your hidden limits. As aheadhunter, this book must be read by every person whoregularly interviews others."
4,Nothing beats shootin' gungans,"Yes, I like playing on Naboo: Plains more than any other level. But how can you not have a good time playing this game? I love being able to have some level of control of my allies, not as much as Star Wars: Republic Commando's, but enough to give some support when you need it. It does get repeditive feel after a while. All in all is a great fun game to play and you don't need to be some uber-player to enjoy it."
5,Amazing!,"Ah, its been a few years since I've played this game. It is such a fun game. It can be repetitve at times, but if you have an imagination and a great liking for Star Wars, this is a game for you! Ages 1-100! I found out the other day that it plays on 360, so i ordered it up, and i haven't gotten off since. The order said 4-14 business days...I got it in 2! I will definitely be ordering from this seller again! Thank you!"
1,HORRIBLE DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Im not a big star wars fan and the only star wars game im ever going to buy is republic commando my friend has this game and he plays it a lot but its horrible they totalay copied BATTLEFIELD 1942 which is a great game:Pros:Some intense battles,real star wars vehicles and maps,o.k graphicsCons:Horrible A.I (sometimes just stands there waiting to be shot),very few maps (compared to BATTLEFIELD 1942),bad map design,very closed in maps,no jedis,a bunch othersso if your a really hardcore starwars fan you might want to check this out if your not buy a game like BATTLEFIELD 1942"
3,"Adequate, but not exemplary","This Xbox game is for the most part an adequate, first person play with lots of realistic graphics and options. I enjoy the opportunity to play each level with a different class of character from the movie. The levels get somewhat tiresome, however, as they are tied exclusively to the movies. It would be better if they had a random play generator that would offer play without ties to the feature films. The controls, once you get used to them, are great and comparable to other first person play. I don't, however, find the aerial combat options adequate. Controlling aircraft isn't easy and combat is even more difficult. I bought this game for less than $20, and for that price, it's adequate play. Would I buy it again? Sure, but I wouldn't have paid the suggested retail."
3,"Easy, visually stimulating...repetitive!","My old roommate Josh use to play this for hours. I mean hours...I once left home at 4:30...returned at 2 in the morning...he was still playing it...insane. To say this game is fun would be an understatement. Its easy to play and not very challenging. But there lies the problem, its too repetitive. The game play doesn't advance beyond the basic fundamentals of operation. You can't upgrade and such to enhance the damage you inflict. Its also time consuming between sets. So when you are doing the same thing over and over and over again for like 20 minutes you get bored fast. The story is really just battle after battle with no choice consequences that is the usual staple of Star Wars games. Fun if you are just looking to bag some rebels or clones. Not so much is you are looking to invest in a story. See Knights of the Old Republic for that."
3,BF I is great but BF II is even greater!,"this game is great, has everything that a person wants from a STar wars game, it takes you to the Clone wars all the way to the days of the Empire.Its not an Hcore game but it still is a good game!!...."
5,He loves it!,"Ordered this for a friend, had it shipped to his house. it arrived quickly, and works perfectly. He loves it!"
1,Infantile Production,"This is not a western as I thought based on the cover picture, but in the mode of the old McCloud TV drama series, I thought it might have some redeeming value as light entertainment. Sadly mistaken. This is a pitiful and failing attempt to capitalize on the (Chuck Norris) Texas rangers get their man no matter what. Poorly written, acted, directed, and edited. Cliche after cliche in one predictable scene after another. I labored through most of the film with the help of 2X fast forward ability, especially the lurid ""sex scene"" and promptly discarded the entire package into thrash recycling.Other than the above, I really liked the title."
5,best yet,An 8 oz bottle of this at my vet is $26.00.It is the best I have found for controlling the scratching of my yorkie.A wash then rub on while he is still damp and away he goes.Great product and I tryed a lot before finding this.
5,Love This Product,"2nd time bought, great price and works great. I will not change to any other product and buy off of amazon because of the reduced price."
5,Great keyboard for the clumsy and sophicated,Really cannot wait until my computer person hooks it up but its really the best it is durable which means a lot in this world of technology to the new and old.Jacqueline Battle
5,perfect sign,Good size and it fits perfect for my needs. Would definitely order more signs and my boys love it as well
3,Arizona Not Route 66,"Tin is great to accessories a thematic room; however, the product I recieved does not say Route but Arizona. This was disappointing, but still serves it purpose in kids CARS themed room."
1,Dark side of America,Things like this movie let you know whats really wrong with this country. Rednecks. Half of these 5 star ratings are clearly people who are racist finding a good place to vent their redneck fears. The main flaw of America is the lack of unity of a country founded on immigrants. No one race is better then the next and fact is America is going to be messed up in 2016 with Obama or Romney. Deal with it because half of you reviewers are to blame for voting Bush in twice. Dummies.
1,A hit piece that is nothing more than an extended attack ad.,This movie is a disgrace and it is outrageous that people do not see it for what it is. There is zero substance here and it is surprising that Obama is not suing for slander.
1,quick bucks,"too bad there are not negative star ratings for products like this. pure hate obama propaganda with rampant speculation and little regard for truth. save your money and watch fox news if you want obama bashing-or better yet do a little reading from impartial sources and fact based news services like npr, bbc and politifact. obama has failed to deliver the change he promised and made mistakes but this movie does not address that. a whole encyclopedia could be written about the disastrous bush administration's mistakes, crimes and corruption."
5,Should have ONE star because....,"..of what another 4 years with this man at the helm would bring this country and the world. DISASTER.The movie connects the dots! Obama-believers will, of course, rate the movie 1 star without even having seen it. Yes, what does that say about such people... People that refuse to take an honest look at the man running for President - again - are not doing this country or themselves a favor. Educate yourself. Some of us made a mistake the first time around, now, due to his record (5+ trillion dollars of added debt, fuel prices through the roof, wars, wars, wars, massive unemployment and division of the American people etc) and proper vetting there will be no mistake the second time around! This movie is a Must-See."
5,Now I Understand . . .,"Once you see this video, things you've wondered about President Obama's actions will start to fall into place. It is creatively superb. The filming and script are terrific. We saw it in the theater and now are buying the video because this is a part of history and we want to own a copy.The author/narrator is great, but we were particularly moved by hearing Obama's voice explaining his life and his motivation, i.e. what is ""in my genes"" at his father's gravesite. Two weeks ago we saw on the news a map showing all the countries where our embassies were under siege, and my husband pointed out that looked just like the map at the end of 2016 Obama's America. He was right. Just as the movie said and right there before our eyes.This video is worth its price and more.Quick and Healthy School Lunches (Moms Can!)"
5,wow!,"this movie isn't about obama, it's about the real obama! this movie will open your eyes and you will know just how far his plans have taken him. you will find out many things you may or may not know about obama.this movie isn't pro anything. it's a warning you will heed! take the time and watch this movie!"
1,2016 Obama's America,"I was not able to see the whole movie because about halfway through, the audio and picture stopped. Attempts to fast forward past any glitch did not work as the movie would not progress past that point. The same thing happened when I tried to play it on my computer so the DVD apparently was defective."
4,Good premise,The movie was not simply a political hatchet job on obama. It actually followed a well thought out and logical case explaining why obama may think the way he does or view america with a slight disdain. Happy with the movie and once again happy with amazon's quick service.
3,Scary!!,I think more people need to read this. This is truly about the person that he is and something we need to be very aware of.
4,Everyone should see this movie,"I found this movie to be very interesting and well done/researched. A lot of things in the movie give an explaination as to why Obama does what he does and thinks the way he thinks. Like him or not, he has kept so much of his life hidden that most don't know him at all. This movie helps fill in the gaps and gives understanding to his actions. It also helps show that Obama isn't a fool not knowing what he's doing; rather it helps to explain his actions and where he wants to take this country. Everyone who cares about the future of this country should watch this movie."
1,Waste of $$$,Typical conservative whack job and their lame views. I am glad I just rented this POS. He tries to link Obama to his theories and is very weak. Only a tea bagger would take this crap serious.
4,Very well and information is excellent.,"I was impressed as to how much information this movie puts out there. Understand that for entertainment value on a scale of 1 to 10 I rate it a 4. So unless you are looking for something in the drama or comedy or other than a political horror story. Then this in my opinion is not for you. I watched this after reading The post president and was impressed with were and how Obama has a very fragile mind set. The book also explains a lot as well. If you want to know what type of person we are dealing with as our president, then you will want to watch and keep an open mind while doing so, if you can."
4,Informative,"This movie really didn't tell me much I didn't already know, but analyzed things in a way that focuses the information into a lens that makes you look at the last 4 yrs in a way that actually makes sense."
4,Open Eyes,"I'm not doing a political commentary like a couple of liberals I noted in the reviews. This is a very well done documentary, one that everyone should watch in order to learn how the political process works. It was very even-handed. It presented the information and a conclusion. It answers many of the why questions that are being asked and NOT answered, especially since the Bengazi FUBAR. Very insightful."
5,Excellent!,A must see by everyone. A true eye opener! Definitely answered a lot of unanswered questions about the Presidents way of thinking and policies.
5,Very well done documentary...sometimes the truth hurts,"d'Sousa did his homework about Obama and Obama's roots. The truth of the facts is indeed frightening, especially when considering that in another four years it will be too late to turn the tide of the destruction of America. We are presently $16 trillion in debt. At the rate that Obama is spending money, even if he raised taxes on everyone to 100%, our debt will exceed our GDP. This fact alone, should scare everyone who even thinks of voting for Obama. He is a good father and husband, and a terrible business manager for the USA. d'Sousa explains the origins of Obama's tenets in this documentary very well. Highly recommended!"
1,GOP Bias,"Not very objective. Mostly conspiracy driven by a naturalized Indian who used his intellectual connections to lambast Obama's heritage. A joke of a project and a waste of money and resources. D'Souza should focus on actual facts not his ""tinker bell"" theories."
1,Insulting to my intelligence,Hyperbole! What a waste of my time to view. There is no concrete evidence to draw ridicules conclusions made in video.
4,A picture of the President elect.,"I thought that the film was well made and that it showed the ""real Obama"" and his intent for the future United States of America. To say more would be a political statement and therefore improper for a product review. The content and quality of the review was good, as was the price. It appears that a lot of research went into this story."
5,A Must See!,Researched well and very insightful. Presentation of facts was articulate and eye opening. This movie is straight on with what is currently taking place now.
1,Factless rantings for the determinedly ignorant,"Nearly every ""fact"" presented in this ""documentary"" has been debunked. Most long before this film was made.A person would have to work very hard at maintaining the level of complete political,and social ignorance it would take to buy into anything presented in this piece of garbage."
3,It is Ok,"This movie was ok, I would rate it OK, There has been some more movies, I would not purchase anymore, they are all about the same."
1,Annoying,I am not rating this as one star because I disagreed with the documentary or have a different opinion than the narrator does of Obama. I am rating it as one star because TURN THE DANG MUSIC DOWN. It was hard to concentrate on what was being said or take any interest when the stupid background music was almost as loud as the talking. I turned it off after 20 minutes.
3,2016 letdown,"This contained lots of interesting viewpoints, but really nothing new. I was under inpressed with it. It dragged on and on without reaching any point of closure."
1,waste of money,Don't waste your money on this film. It was recommended to me to watch it with an open mind. I did. But there was nothing about Obama's life past or present that made me want to vote for him. I think he not only got in with the wrong crowd in college....it appears he was in with the wrong crowd way before that. I do not like the direction he is taking my country and it's people to. He doesn't care about the people....it's all about him and what he wants to leave us with.
5,2016 Obama's America,"I was amazed at the detail and quality of the movie/ DVD ""2016 Obama's America. Especially in using Obama's own words from his books to understand his Anti-colonial mindset. We are in for an interesting next for years!! ""Remember Bengazi"""
2,2016,"This is a propaganda piece for the right-wing fringe, pure and simple. Not worth watching. Full of conjecture and faulty logic, in a slick infomercial package."
5,Explains Obama Very Well,Explains Obama's goals and his socialist plan for America.Liberals may not like it...but everything is backed up with facts.
2,Biased and non-factual reporting,"This film is presented as a well-researched documentary, but there are statements made that are incorrect and misleading. Half-truths or misstatements masquerade as documented, researched facts. Additionally, Dinesh D'Souza compares his background and early beginnings to President Obama's. There is no basis for this camparison. It appears that Mr. D'Souza came from a very comfortable beginning, I would say wealthy, in his native India. I would urge viewers to research Mr. D'Souza and use critical thinking skills to discern fact from fiction in the film, while noting that Mr. D'Souza has a conservative agenda to pursue."
4,Everyone in America should see this film,"One way of bringing to light who this man Really is and the people that influenced his Marxist,Radical beliefs.America is in great Danger with Obama and his administration.Just google ANY one of His Zars and you will be Shocked"
1,Just bad,Doesn't discuss policy and claims that ideas have no backing from other policy makers (not true) and that they must be anti-colonialist.
1,All rumors,None of this movie seemed accurate in almost any way. Dinesh is a conspiracy theorist and there isn't much else to say about it.
1,2016 obamas AMERICA,The reality of it. I would suggest that every American see it. Its' not political just factual. Very revealing and it gives understanding to the man.
2,2016 Obama's America,Was not impressed with this at all....had looked forward to seeing it and feel it fell short on many counts. It was a waste of money!!!
1,Take a look at the negative to positive review ratio of previous reviews,"An obvious partisan argument of epic proportions. The one thing I can say about this documentary is it IS epic. Epically boring that is. That this film actually can get traction in today's America is a sad commentary on our inability to do our own fact checking, accepting any sound bite as the gospel truth. People believe in God on faith, so why should a god-fearing American lie to his fellow man. Why don't all who view this film actually fact-check the details provided before condemnation of the man. We need to make our own decisions and stop being sheep in the media pasture. Let him who is without sin cast the first stone..."
1,Good for Romney supporters,"The word documentary is so interesting, it is often misused and wrongly stamped on products. Don't waste your money. Go and read a good book or enjoy time with your family. I was bored."
4,Curiosity got the best of me.,"Curiosity was the only reason I watched this movie. The price was reasonable, the content was okay. It's a different view of our president. It didn't change the way I view him at all."
1,Another Political Movie?,"Try as it might, this movie is just a negative political advertisement. No matter how hard it tried to present material as ""Just the Facts-Nothing But the Facts,"" it is still a character assassination of a political opponent. Can't wait for the sequel, can you?"
4,2016 Obama's America,"It is interesting that most talk show hosts are not educated in order to educate the people that listen to them. So often, I have heard people call in to a program to be shut off immediately or told they are a conspiracy nut. If the talk show host had listen back in 2006 Obama might not have gotten elected. I hope many will watch and do more research."
3,It did not tell enough of the real story,Right after reading the book and seeing the film there was another film of Obama admitting he IS a muslim. Shouldn't everybody know thiat? Nobody on any news or information station wants to cover those details.
5,The Truth about obama from facts about his upbringing!,The libtard element won't like this movie because it reveals the true background and upbringing of Barack Obama. The movie does not dispute obama's birth place nor does it call him a muslim or a communist. Rather from his own autobiography and from interviewing people from his past it sheds light on why he has made the choices he has. For those undecided or former followers of obama this movie will open up your eyes to the man who is potus.
5,2016 Obama's America,"All I can say is OH MY GOD! I ordered the CD, got it in a few days, watched it the same day. I was so taken back by this film, I pasted it on to a number of friends to see. Everyone should have seen this film before Nov. 2012."
3,The basis of the man today,2016 Obama's America I would recommend this book to anyone wanting to take an open-minded view of those we elect to highest office. This gave information throughout the formative years explaining how perhaps today's agenda of this person has been formed.
5,Awesome,"This is a must see for everyone, not just Republicans. You need to know what is in store for us all!"
2,BORING!,"I am NOT an Obama fan so I thought I might like this film but I will tell you that it is one of the most boring films I have ever seen. We turned it off about 15 minutes before the end just because we were bored. The information might be true but it is all stuff that makes you think ""who cares??"""
1,"HE WON, GET OVER IT!","This movie was trash. All you people who watched this (some watched it more than once) need to move on. You have an amazing President who was elected by the people. This is a new America, if you don't like it, move to CANADA!!!"
2,This is a political propaganga piece.,"Let's us be very clear that '2016 Obama's America' is a political propaganda piece for the 'Obama Haters'. My question to all those supporting Mitt Romney, why call your message 'Keep America American' when workers at Bain Capital-owned Sensata at 2520 Walnut St, Freeport, Illinois blocked the trucks that are loading and hauling their factory and jobs to China?. Read more at BAINPORT."
1,Disappointing,"I don't know why I thought this was going to be a biographical documentary, especially given the sinister appearance they captured in the graphic design for this film. This is purely a partisan Obama bashing campaign, released just in time for election season. The whole ""Hey, brown people hate Barack Obama too. See, we found one."" approach is entirely unconvincing. Try again."
3,Just not quite what I expected.,I guess I already knew most of this information and was looking for something different and informative but it was well done.
4,An eye opening film,"The film does a great job of explaining why our president thinks and acts the way he does. I can now understand....but just wonder at how he has become, and stayed the President of these United States of America."
1,Another attack on American freedom from the right,"Positive reviews cannot distinguish between chicken salad and chicken sh*t. If you hate Obama you will love this biased and manufactured re-vision of the man and ""the facts."" if you care for a reasoned and objective presentation of infomation, avoid this conspiracy-laden propaganda disinformation tool of the right. The source of this diatribe (D'Sousa) is known for his attacks against anything that opposes his extremely conservative world view. Racists, the Tea Party, and wing nuts will keep this video at the top of the charts until Obama is out of office."
2,Biased.,"People can argue all day long that this movie isn't biased, but I don't agree in the least bit. That is the only reason I didn't like it."
1,it was garbage!,"This is garbage, what's the deal? I guess the director/producer is writing many of these reviews because I was terribly disappointed! ~ I'm an independent so I have no bias either way!"
3,Very informative,It was very informative and now we know what he is really like and his motives for what he is doing to America. But at times got bogged down with so much info.I pray for America because if he is re-elected I am sure he is taking us down the path to destruction.
4,Revealing Report,The first part seemed to move slowly with lots of background info. The claims of Obama's future plans seemed very believable.
5,2016 Obama's America,This video is very enlightening. It presents the true agenda of Obama and his philosophy. Scary for our country!!! Every American should have seen this video before the election.
3,Should be in jail,i find it hard to beleave that so maney people voted for this nut. With everything he has done all the money he missspent He shuld be in jail.
5,2016 obama's America,Excellent movie to bad everyooone did not see it before he was re elected. He has done no justice to our beloved AMERICA. God bless the USA.
2,Should have been required reading before Election !!,"Probably the most truthful thing I have seen, read or heard in a long time! Really shook me up emotionally."
5,Very enlightening,This should be required viewing for all Americans. I feel like we have all been snowed by the liberal media
1,Yet another trying to get rich off of Obama's name,"This documentary was not worth my time or attention. It was based off of speculation and opinion, not facts. The credibility of the ""director and writer"" echo's nothing more than an opportunity to capitalize off of the Obama name. The finished product is evident that the ""director/writer"" knows nothing about President Barack Obama but knows a lot about twisting the truth."
5,Very Informative,The video was well-done and very informative! Wished more people had the opportunity to view this film. Might have changed the outcome of the election.
3,Everything I altready knew.,"The movie was everything I already knew. I am not and Obama fan, but I was not impressed with the information I gathered from this film. It was well done, but redundant to me."
2,disappointment in a shell,I was expecting some answers to a lot of questions. I think that there was a lot of hype over not much of anything
2,dissapointed,"by the tittle of this movie, i thought it was going to be a impartial documentary, instead came out to be a smooth theorist antiobama propaganda. I give him credit for the extensive research collecting background information, and the analysis of why America felt oblige to Obama on electing president of the US. But nevertheless, this film fails to signal key policies that this administration has achieve. I dont agreed with manny policies this administration has place, but i do agree with others. By being oneside view, this movie loose credibility."
2,"poor shipment, 2 day shipment will arrive in 6 days!!!!!","Paid for two day shipment it will arrive in 4 business day, or 6 days in total!!! not worth the extra money"
4,"Chilling unsolved crime as recorded by a contemporary, with Geary's fantastic pictures","The title page says it all: ""A Journal of the Whitechapel Murders 1888-1889 Adapted by Rick Geary."" Don't expect shocking new ""revelations"" or speculations as to the identity of the Ripper; the text comprises excerpts from the journals of an anonymous Victorian chronicler of the Ripper's crimes. Yet it is precisely the ordinary, ""following the day's news"" quality of this account that is so chilling---it reminds the reader that the lost lives of these poor women were REAL and that their murders were never solved. Geary's renderings, as always, succeed admirably in fleshing out the journal entries, and his use of maps as backgrounds for many of his panels is ingenious. Reading this book was a fine approximation of taking a Ripper walking tour through Whitechapel."
2,Even on DVD this can't be saved,"My brother actually got Nude basketball for VHS, then he rented this combo on netflix. Bad thing is that even on the dvd, there is nothing really extra. Like a past review n Nude basketball, they should had made the game like every few touchdowns then that team must lose a article of clothing but we are always interrupted by the host and when it resumes the gameplay the girls are either topless or naked already. Another excused just to see T&A very fast. The feature was partially saved by Nikki Nova who plays as muffy in Nude Football. She is probably the hottest girl to look at but, still like what I mention above, it is still a dissapointment. Have a nice day."
1,Think about it,"The quality of the movie is week, but the idea is interesting. It seams that being 'nude' is associated with 'adult films' when in real life 1000's of people do their things 'nude' without any sexual practises. This film is ok as a 'adult film' but not for the person interested in the 'nude way of life'."
1,BOX DOES NOT STATE WORKS WITH WINDOWS XP,"This is an older 2001 Year model which is discontinued.www.gyration.com has no information on this model as the items box states YEAR 2001 on the box.The box does NOT state the item works with Windows XP.I am returning mine and purchasing the new model together withthe keyboard and I am certain they will make a nice addition tomy computer.The owners Manual you download here at Amazon.com states itDOES work with Windows XP but REMEMBER it is discontinuedand the included RF receiver is different than the new models RFReceiver, so I wonder if it will work and is compatible with aNEW MODEL YEAR 2003 GYRATION KEYBOARD ???"
2,"nice looking, strange footbeds","Love the way these look, but...Tried these on for all of 10 min at home and had to send them back: the outside (lateral?) edge of the footbed is higher than the inside (arch) area. Very uncomfortable.If you are a person who likes arch support, or has a problem with over pronation (rolling ankle inward), then these are really not for you."
1,TERRIBLE SHOES!..FELL APART IN 6 WEEKS!,"PURCHASED THE JOURNEYMAN SHOES ON VACATION TO REPLACE A SIMILAR PAIR FROM KOHLS THAT LASTED 2+YEARS...THE ENTIRE INTERIOR OF THESE SHOES FELL APART WITHIN 6 WEEKS!!..SKETCHERS WANTED ME TO DRIVE 585 MILES TO RETURN THESE CRUMMY SHOES AT THE STORE I PURCHASED THEM AT....OR...I COULD PAY FOR SHIPPING,SEND THEM TO SKETCHERS, AND IN 8 WEEKS BE INFORMED IF IT WAS A MANUFACTURERS DEFECT...AND EVEN THEN,MY MONEY WOULDN'T BE REFUNDED, I WOULD JUST BE SENT ANOTHER PAIR OF CRAP!...AVOID SKETCHERS, VERY UNFRIENDLY AND ANTI-CUSTOMER!!!.AVOID THESE SHOES!!...WISH I HAD THE OPTION TO CHOOSE ZERO STARS IN THIS REVIEW,LOWEST I COULD GO WAS ONE STAR..."
3,Size runs small,"bought a size 10 (normal size) and could not get foot into the opening. Size runs very small, or misplaced in wrong box. I couldn't find a size marking in the shoe."
2,Stinky Shoes!,"The sandals are comfortable and they look nice. However, they have a very pungent smell. I am not exactly sure how to describe it. It is almost as if these shoes were made of recycled garbage. I know that sounds crazy, but the odor is really strong. I had hoped that over time the odor would fade, but that has not been the case. In fact, I do not keep the shoes in the house because whatever room I put them in begins to smell like the shoes. I also will not wear them if I am going to be confined to one place such as in a baseball stadium or at a party. These sandals are fine for for running errands or doing yard work, but the smell really keeps me from using them very much. Overall, I would not recommend these shoes nor would I buy them again."
4,My first pair of great sandals!,"I bought these prior to going hiking for a couple of weeks in the Tetons and in Yellowstone. I wore them practically every day and found them to be incredibly comfortable. While I have narrow feet and these only come in medium width (my reason for 4, not 5 stars), they are adjustable enough to fit comfortably. It was great to be able to hike along a path and ford streams without changing or removing my shoes, and getting through airport security was a snap. I would not hesitate to recommend these sandals to others, and they look great too."
2,God help your feet.,"These looked like a good pair of sandals. They would even probably be comfortable if they had some arch support. Believe the other reviews that say these have no arch support. After about an hour, your feet will be killing you."
1,Horribly cheap,Horribly cheap fell apart after 6 months my last pair I bought lasted 4 years of world traveling it sucked
3,Clip-on failure,The clip on weight used to determine placement of the permanent weight is plastic and was too tight for my fan blades. I broke 3 of them while trying to balance 4 fans.
4,Ficciones: aún relevante aunque sin la sorpresa de hace 50 años,"Borges es sin duda un maestro de las micro-narraciones. Cada cuento reunido en este libro es una lección de cómo escribir una historia en pocas páginas.Los temas que toca Ficciones son conocidos: laberintos, la muerte, el sentido de la vida, la mente humana, religiones, Dios, y otros. Una de mis frases favoritas del libro, ""Lo que hace un hombre es como si lo hicieran todos los hombres,"" da cuenta de sus creencias filosóficas y religiosas.Para el lector actual, si bien muchos de los temas siguen relevantes y las narraciones son pequeñas obras maestras, el libro sufre un poco de ""envejecimiento."" Laberintos, la mente, el materialismo dialéctico (sólo por nombrar algunos tópicas) son temas que ya han sido elaborados por muchas otras disciplinas. A diferencia de un Dostoyevski, por ejemplo, el libro no logró atraerme e iluminar con nuevos significados algunas problemáticas eternas del hombre. Quizás soy sólo yo como lector."
3,movie,i thought the movie was pretty good but some parts were kind of boring. i would recommend this movie to people.
3,OK,"I am a huge Keaggy fan, however thus album is mostly just leftover recording session jams. It is worth having in the collection ,but falls short for me. It reminds me of when The Who made ""Odds and Sods"", an album of material that was left over. A few selections are great, but the rest , not so much."
2,Why can no one make a good running light?,"Upon arrival, only two of the three lights worked. In addition, they were not as pictured-- all three had clear covers (no red). The light is not very bright and they take special batteries (this is acknowledged at purchase but inconvenient when they arrive in non-working condition). Okay value for the price but not recommended. However, since all running lights seem to be bad, maybe they're an OK option."
4,An essential for a tenor....a jewel for a music lover.,"I'm a music performance major in college. I need to collect a wide variety of performers on different pieces I add to my repetoire. Caruso is by far one of the greatest tenors of all time. Pavorotti is known for his high C's, well Caruso is known for the grace in which he can sing them. As a music lover I love to listen just for the feeling and emotion he puts into his music. As a student, he adds so many different embelishments on phrases that can change a boring phrase into a title line. I consider this a bare essential purchase."
1,Neat Idea - Annoying Listen,"Well, I thought I would be into the disk from the above description...but I don't think I'll really find myself putting this on very often. I guess the fact that it was done on laptop with probably the same software every joe shmoe has lends to it sounding somewhat predictable and boring. I guess they made good on delivering something made with adequate computer technical skills, but this is really lacking in inspiration. Sorry, you are not a winner, please try again!"
1,DO NOT BUY!!!!!,"these are free from bose!!!!do not buy them, go to a bose store or register your headphones and they will send you new ones regularly."
5,Piece of Cake,This is the story of the RAF in France and later at the cliffs of Dover. The acting is wonderful and the aerial fight scenes are unbelievably realistic. I'd seen the mini-series on Masterpiece Theatre when it was first shown in the States over ten years ago but had forgotten how gripping it was. I wouldn't give up this DVD for anything now. It's outstanding.
4,Piece of cake is good realism,"Let me say it was good - and why. I thought it was a movie and found it was a collection of a series of stories set in WW2. The realism was excellent in that it was not a modern day romance, but factual in how people related to one another a half a century or more ago.Friends who have watched the movie with us liked it too...even though one said that she probably wouldn't.My husband's only critic of the movie was that the Spitfires that they used were Mark 9's and not Mark 1&2's..as was the case in the time period of the movie.The air combat scenes were excellent."
4,"Read the book, see the movie, and then fly some flight sim","Both the audio and video transfer are good.The Dolby 2 sound is good. 5.1 would have been better.It is very critical that you first read the book. The character developement in the movie is lacking and therefore some of the scenes do not have the full impact; ie the back armour, Hart's Spain experience, the harmonization of the guns, and Fanny's concerns about leading the squadron.There are significant plot difference between the book and the movie.Upon initial viewing I was very disappointed. However, after flying some Microsoft Combat Flight simulator, and re-reading the book, subsequent viewings improved.If you have not read the book you will be missing a lot of the sub-plot lines that are barely touched upon in the movie."
4,Piece of Cake,"The only reason I give it 4 stars is because the (DVD transcription) dialog is hard to make out. The sound track is so muddy -- that combined with the British accent, it needs closed captions for hearing impared. Maybe I got a bad copy? I watched it twice on the tube - initial and rerun -- and loved it. As an old retarded fighter pilot I still recommed it highly."
3,Very helpful with a major caveat,"This book is good for the price. There is a lot of helpful advice in it on healthy choices for snacks, sensible meals, and he even ENCOURAGES cheating! A very good idea because, hey, we have to enjoy life, after all. Very helpful to have the paperback to carry in your bag because he gives sensible things to order in popular restaurants. Which are loaded with diet busting pitfalls! Even recommending what to order at DAIRY QUEEN!!However, the one thing I have a major problem with is how he pushes dairy. I do not buy into the latest propaganda put out by the dairy industry that says drinking milk and eating dairy helps you lose weight. I find that downright FALSE!! Also, he recommends whey protein which if you knew what it actually was, would never eat it. Put all that aside and he does have some very good advice on eating right sensibly and working out."
4,Eating Out...,And I don't just mean the ladies... ;) Great guide to help you stick to the diet if your out and aboot.
4,Great reference but repetitive,"This book again has great info in it, it does however repeat everything from the Abs Diet book. I just wish it was smaller to really make it easier to keep with you. It could have done without reiterating all the Abs Diet info and sticking to the ""eat this, not that"" kind of info, and helpful grocery tips."
4,Abs,Excellent book...gives you an outlook on changing your eating habits that is not your typical diet. A way to change your way of eating for life.
5,a way to live,"as a single person, i finally found recipes that i follow, thatmake sense, and are simpple. i feel like i have a new life. noneed to pound down 3 burritos or 2 star burgers on the way home.i did not read the first book and found this one to be all i need."
1,uncomfortable,The ankle braces do support your ankle properly but rub my side ankle bone when I try to run in them...very uncomfortable
4,Story description:,"Twenty years earlier, on the mist-shrouded North Fork of Long Island, Erika's mother was murdered by her lover. Erika's father closed his hotel and left to sail the seven seas, while Erika was whisked away to live with an aunt.Now Erika was back to reopen the hotel, and lay to rest the ghosts. But they refused to comply. The eerie strains of a waltz drifted from the deserted ballroom; someone or something, stalked her at night; then a fire...But most terrifying of all was the fatal attraction between Erika and David. For he was the son of the man who murdered her mother-and he was Erika's half brother..."
5,We love the Boy Wonder!,"My 3 year old had a great time as Robin! The costume fit well and with just the tie on mask, it was easy for him to wear and take off when he felt like it. No sweating and obstructed vision like masks that cover the entire head."
1,ooga horn,The horn sounds too fast so you dont get the good old drawn out oooga sound. It also does not sound clear and sharp. Not like the one when I was a kid.
4,"Excellent book, but vol. 3, not vol. 1","Lacey's ""Great Tales From English History"" is a great and entertaining series, but I want to emphasize that the Kindle download edition is volume 3 of the series, not the volume 1 that the description and most of the reviews reference. It's still a wonderful book, just know which one you're getting."
1,"great title,little content","This book takes a simple idea---that we all have slips of the tongue and you can learn what is on a person's mind from them---and turns it into a book which repeats it,over and over again,without any illumination."
1,Sony SRF-HM01V S2 Sports Walkman Street Style,The wearability of this walkman is fine but it is extremely difficult to program. Setting the channels is challenging at best and if you hit the wrong buttons by mistake you can wipe out a bunch of channels. If you do buy this unit make sure you keep all the directions. They're supposed to be on the web somewhere but even that's hard to find. No possible way of figuring it out on your own!!!!
1,"A good idea, poorly executed","If, like I, you are looking for a truly portable radio to use in the gym, take a pass on this one. Specifically:1. The controls are non-intuitive, tiny, and difficult to use.2. When used indoors, it is vulnerable to RF interference (static).3. Like most Asian electronics, it has too many features. Who really wants to listen to TV and weather bands? AM and FM alone are enough.4. The unit is reatively heavy, bulky and uncomfortable.Don't waste your money. You'll end up not using it."
1,Poor FM Reception,"I bought one of these for my spouse to use at the gym. She tried it once and immediately complained that FM reception was poor. We live in a major metro area with a lot of stations, but this product could not tune in many of them. We returned it to the store and purchased an older Sony headband radio model(that actullay works) on the web."
2,"OK reception, inconsiderate design, uncomfortable.","The first attraction of this headphone radion is it's sleek design. The reception is pretty good, the sound quality is not great but it's radio. People are made of different sizes. This headphone was not design to accomodate that. If you have a small or big head, this headphone is not for you. I have a neck size of 17"", this head barely fit on me. It is very uncomfortable on me, my ear feel squashed and pulled by the headphone. SONY should have been more considerate to people like me and design a better headphone. They should try harder and made it adjustable to fit all head sizes. I'm very disappointed but praise its sleek design. If you're petite/big/tall, this headphone may not be the right for you."
1,What a sad excuse!,"I have an old sony ""Sports"" headset radio -- Model SRF-M59. I have used it and loved it for years, but it's fallingn apart. When Sony came out with this one, I was happy to order it, thinking it would be as good as my old one. It is not. We have a strong local FM station and I can't even get it much of the time. I'm back to using my old one -- and buying duct tape."
1,Truly Pathetic,"The previous reviewer was generous in saying this video might be appropriate for children. It is simply awful. Not worth the shipping costs. Fortunately, I got it free through the public library."
1,A book that should have never been published.,"For the price, this book is trash. Learning PK parameters with this book is nearly impossible. I have been working in the pharmacy field as a hospital clinician for 18 years and I couldn't understand a thing from this book. Save your money and buy a well-known book. Michael Winter's book is a better deal. This (Borne) author seems to like $50-words that never say anything. This leads to a misunderstanding of terms. My advice to him: Stop taking everything rightly learned in nonsensical garbage."
4,Great Music,I really like this CD. Reminds me of 70 - 80's classic rock. Hope he puts out more stuff.
3,Not like the picture,"First of all the pads were not like the picture. There were no gathers on the sides. They are completely flat. Therefore they leaked during the night. They would be better if they had some kind of adhesive to stick to underwear. Using safety pins I don't consider too safe. You have to use something otherwise they will keep shifting. The pins can open during the night and stick someone. These really are too big for our needs, but we will use them anyway, and make due."
3,Portable 6 inch black light,Product works ok. Not sure what wave length. Makes some of my rocks fluoresce and others it barely does anything to
2,Very cheaply made.,This black light started smoking from around the light bulb about after five minutes. Please do not waste your money.
2,too cheap,"This item is really cheap, not really any good, too bad it doesn't have great brightness, don't buy. boo boo"
3,It's ok,"I hoped to use the black light to find stains. It took me a while to figure out what i was doing wrong, but I did find them and was able to clean them. No buyers remorse here."
2,Doesn't work at times.,It's a handheld blacklight. Nothing difficult about that.It stops working though at times. Not worth the money I spent on it. Could get better quality for the price somewhere else.
1,Trash,This item broke within 20 minutes of using it. The builtin flashlight still works but the black light went out. It was set up on a dresser and so not being jostled or dropped at all. No excuse. Verrry cheaply made
2,Quite Disappointing,"I have always loved books by Mrs. Forster and I look forward to reading her love stories. However, with Secret Desire, I was completely disappointed with how slow and long this book was. Even the flow of the story was not smooth and seemed sort of thrown together with a story line that could have been written better. I am still a fan and look forward to future books, but I would not suggest this book for reading."
4,Make sure this is the right tool you need,"The tool itself is actually pretty good quality. The problem is the item description doesn't make it very clear this tool is for old Hondas. It will not work on modern Hondas or Acuras with the hexagonal opening in the crank pulley. There is a different tool for that crank pulley and it can be bought here at A[...] at a very good price. I ended up keeping this in case I need it in the future or for any other pulleys with holes in its face. I purchased and also bought the other tool.This is the crank tool most Honda and Acura owners will need, search Amazon for:Alltrade 648796 Honda Crankcase Pulley Removal Tool"
2,"Right product, wrong purpose","I don't think I'd waste the money to use them for the intended purpose of disposable washcloths, but these things are great for parents of newborns for another use. A well-respected hospital in our area discourages parents of newborns from using baby wipes for the first few weeks because many newborns cannot tolerate the chemicals included in those wipes. They say to use a washcloth instead...we tried the soap-free version (not found on this site) and they worked great when moistened under the sink.However, if you use the soapy kind as wipes, you have to sit at the sink and rinse out all the lather so you can use it for your baby's sensitive bottom. We did that, and it's a pain in the...well, bottom. Another downside if you use this product for this purpose is that the cost is a little much considering you go through a package in 2 days."
2,Not that great.......regular washcloth and soap are better,"I got a sample pack of three of these in the mail, so I tried them out. I didn't really like them. They were thin, they don't smell good and are too expensive for everyday use. I regular washcloth and soap are better. Don't wash your money!!"
1,Worst Laptop EVER,"Within 3 months the modem melted. I took it to Best Buy where I bought it. After 3 months I got it back, without the battery/casing and powercord. It also wasn't my original computer. Best Buy refused to replace the battery which retails for $250 dollars. I called HP as well as Best Buy's corporate headquarters. No luck.Then after 3 months the ""new"" computer's harddrive started clicking. The click of death. The computer could be on for about 15 minutes before it shut down with severe errors. No virus or worm mind you.I would never buy a HP laptop from Best Buy or a HP computer ever after this."
2,"Limited depth, sloppy coding styles in examples.","I found that it is largely full of code listings, and short on background information. The coding style seems very much stuck in the VB6 world, and the author needs to acquaint himself with the guidelines for coding in .NET (e.g., naming, etc.).At the time I bought this book, it was the only book around for VS.NET add-in development. I did get some value out of it, but now that I've done more development of add-ins and VSIP packages for Visual Studio .NET, I find this book very thin on information, and full of sloppy errors.It might be useful if you are writing VS.NET add ins (but take it with a grain of salt). If you want to develop add-ins, and learn about Visual Studio .NET in general, ""Inside Microsoft Visual Studio .NET"" is a far better choice."
3,Warning to anyone outside the US,Digital FM does not work correctly outside the US unless it has a switch to change the way it tunes. Be careful that any FM you order outside your own country is compatible.
2,I wish I'd read these reviews before I bought one,"The reception is poor, the controls are difficult to operate, the armband is OK but awkward. Fortunately at the gym where I work out they have their own frequencies matched with the six TV screens arrayed at one side of the largest work-out area, and this gizmo works fine there. But when I use the Walkman when I'm running or walking outdoors, I get a delightful variety of staticky stations.Scott Morrison"
2,Replacement Parts? A Joke!!,"I purchased this product because I'm an avid jogger/runner and I like to be entertained while I run. Often, I use an MP3 player, but the MP3 player has a lousy FM tuner. Sometimes, I also like to listen to AM radio. Well, while jogging one day I tripped over a rock and fell on the radio that was strapped to my arm. The radio was built well and was not damaged, but the expandable strap fell apart. For about 2 weeks, I tried to find a replacement armband and there is no place where I can find one. So here I have a real receptive radio that I'd like to use while jogging and I can't find a replacement armband.What a joke! Maybe this is the time of disposable electronics, but, I still have a little tinny radio that still works as good as the day I bought it 5 years ago. Go figure. Maybe someone will respond with a location that I can use to buy a replacement armband and then I might change my review as to how good the unit operates?"
3,Solid product; TV feature disappointing,"I bought the S2 solely for the TV audio feature. Unfortunately, the unit only receives VHF-range channels (2-13). This limitation wasn't documented anywhere.Otherwise, I've been happy with the product."
4,functional and worth the money,"It works fine. The buttons are a little limiting- they're not in great order to go back and forth between fm1, fm2, am, tv easily while running but it's a good unit for the money"
2,Bad interface,"I intended to use this radio while jogging, but that's just about impossible. First of all, unlike Sony's older molder that simply had up/down bottons for moving through the pre-set stations, this unit uses a separate button for each station. It's very difficult to select a station without stopping and looking at the unit. The buttons aren't even arranged well so that you could just feel around for them, just look at the picture. In addition to the five buttons for the preset stations, there are 4 or 5 more bottons, all the same size, that can be accidently pressed as well. In short, navigating stations while jogging is about impossible. Too make matters worse, the volume dial is easily bumped, and very sensitive. So, while jogging along, trying to change stations, you're likely to blast your ears out accidently."
5,Kingston 2 GB DataTraveller II USB 2.0 excellent for Mac and PC,"I have used this flash drive for about a month now, going back and forth between a MacBook and a PC. Never any compatibility or accessing issues, files copy promptly, and it's been well-behaved. It's thin enough to fit side-by side with another USB device on the MacBook, and it feels quite sturdy in the hand. The removable top fits snugly, and has never come off in my purse. There's a teensy hole on this drive if you want to put one of those really thin-ended lanyards on, but it had better as thin as a thread. I haven't bothered."
4,Frank has gone back to his roots for a winner!!!!,"I was so pleased to receive the new Frank Delima CD. I have been a fan of Frank's for 18 years and have bought every CD and video available and was very disappointed with his prior CD Babooze...however, Ethnicology 101 has recaptured the old Frank at what he does best....combining Hawaiian Ethnic humor with well known tunes."
4,Useful and rarely explained concepts,"It is sad that this text is out of print. There are so many amazingly useful concepts developed here. For example, the estimation of difficult integrals and the use of polynomial generating functions as a way to handle many combinatoric problems are carefully developed here. These are the ""nuts and bolts"" of analysis that are usually taken for granted in other textbooks. The author sincerely tries to develop the ideas behind each of the concepts. My only complaint is that there are not enough exercises that illuminate the important concepts that are discussed. Also, sometimes the author seems rushed in his exposition, which really makes it hard for the reader to keep up. This book is part of the series that in general I highly recommend. In fact, this is probably one of the top five books in the problem series."
3,"These features are for true Christie fans, otherwise a bit tedious","We have nearly all Agatha Christie books and DVDs. My wife was struck by this set as John Nettles was featured (albeit he was only in one.) These are not mysteries in the classic sense of Miss Marple or Hercule Poirot, although they are mysteries of a sort with twisted endings. These four stories take place in the 20s and possibly the 30s so they do provide insight to that period. For most people they are slow developing stories and a bit tedious to watch. I would only recommend this Set for die-hard Chrisie fans."
3,Reynaldo,Spotty . You can tell Christie was in the process of finding herself as a writer.Production quality is not great. Not up to Miss Marple(Jane Hickson) or David Suchet's early Poirrot's.
1,save your money,"really, really, REALLY bad television. Believe it or not, I threw my copy away after watching only three episodes. These are not mysteries, they are pseudo dramas, as only the English can script--or enjoy.Bad production values, bad stories, unremarkable casting.tlt"
5,Rare and Undiscovered,"Very rarely do we have the opportunity to experience ""the real thing"" musically. Bonni Evensen offers the listner that rare confuluence of deeply emotive writting with subtle, dreamy musical landscapes. If the title song ""Lilywhite"" does not bring tears to your eyes then you must be made of stone. This is late night listening by the fire or driving on some lonely stretch of desert road.It is always fun to discover the undiscovered, it is breathtaking to unearth that rare gem... and a rare gem awaits you with Snowy."
1,"Fake Nokia battery, made in Korea and China not Japan","I just received my ""Nokia OEM BL-5C Li-Ion Battery with Authentic Nokia Hologram"" in the mail and it has a Hologram alright it's just been lifted in the corner of it and pried off another battery. This one was manufactured in Korea and ""further processed in China"". I was foolish enough to fall for this, trust me this is no bargain! Thanks BARGAINCELL, in South El Monte California, with no phone number on your invoice, thanks a lot!"
5,WOW!!,"I have had this almost a month. The display is unbelievable, I played ""Oh Brother Where Art'd Thou"" DVD and saw things I didn't even notice on the TV. It is simple has everything you need and the burner works like a floppy. If you want to use a mouse and/or a keyboard, it uses USB only. XP works great on it also. It does digital photos like an editing studio.I planned to use it for the vacation place, but my wife has captured it for her use in the house with a wireless connection to DSL, it goes anywhere."
4,Does Not Read Memory Stick PRO,"This unit features a decent price, however it does not read my Memory Stick PRO memory sticks. Putting one of these into the unit makes it shut down."
1,CAUTION NOT FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION,"I needed this for a special Iranian Recipe our dinner club assigned me. Bought it from the foods section, right on the bottle it says not to be ingested or swallowed. CAUTION DO NOT USE FOR FOOD! ! !"
4,Record,This product was just what I was hoping for and was received in a timely manner. It helped my family go back to their childhood and created a warm tone in our house at Christmas time. It was in great shape.
2,Not a good overview text of the subject.,"I used this book as the primary text for a graduate course on evolutionary computation. I was looking for a book that provided a good introduction to genetic algorithms and provided a wide cross-section of related algorithms and applications. At the time, this was the only book of its type on the market (other than Goldberg's book). The first couple of chapters (What is a GA, Why Does a GA Work) were pretty good, but then the strong focus of the remainder of the book on numerical optimization resulted in a loss of interest on the part of my students. Since then, I have had to re-organize the class to provide topics such as genetic programming, evolving neural systems, co-evolution, and artificial life -- none of which are covered adequately (if at all) in this book."
4,Good introduction to the topic of evolutionary algorithms.,"Note that a genetic algorithm is different from a genetic algorithm(Holland is responsible for the latter, Michalwicz for the former). The text is meant as an introduction to successful strategies for implementing EA's. As such, the text doesn't really cover any other areas(save a brief introduction to genetic algorithms at the beginning). Good as a primer and textbook. Not meant as a handbook of applications."
4,Entertaining & Nicely Written,"""Space"" is quite readable and entertaining, but all the people who plan to buy the book because it is about space, or rockets, or Cape Canaveral, should buy something else. How Ms. Kercheval remembers all this stuff from when she was nine is beyond me, and it was also a little confusing how she kept switching years ahead: in one chapter she'd be thirteen, than fifteen in the next. And her older years went by very quickly- she'd describe other things in detail, but I got the feeling that by the last chapters she just wanted to wrap it up. All in all, it was fun, in a depressing way."
5,Reading this book is like being there.,"Reading this book is just like being there. I am nearly the same age as Jesse Kercheval is and I loved her detail of the space center area. Our family vacations there occasionally. The stories in the book of her growing up were fascinating, and I found I could'nt put the book down, that's rare for me, and I read a lot. When an event such as a space launch took place that she wrote about I thought to myself that I was doing this or that, and where. It was great to get the perspective of a girl growing up in a time and place that will never happen again, and very humorous also, I laughed and laughed at times. Jesse, thanks for this treasure."
2,"Initially appealing, but eventually disappointing","Since I was fascinated with the space program as a boy in the mid sixties I was particularly anxious to read the memoirs of a young girl whose family was a participant. The book jacket promised a ""brilliant rendering of an era...of a whole country poised on the edge of...the future of NASA, the outcome of the war and women's lib."" The use of the term ""women's lib"" instead of ""feminism"" should have tipped me off that this would be trivial, trite, and superficial, but I persisted. Finally, on page 160: ""After Gretel left, no one scattered Kotex around the living room or ate all the Dixie cups from the trash can in the bedroom."" That's when I realized that this book is the literary equivalent of Bertha's behavior and moved on to two superb books, Rick Bass' The Sky, the Stars, the Wilderness and Castle Freeman Jr's Judgement Hill. Buy them instead of Space."
1,Europe's Monastery and Convent Guesthouses,A waste of money as a travel guide to monastery and convent guesthouses. Travel guide? It doesn't guide one anywhere to any guesthouse.
4,Europe Guesthouse & Convent,I found this book to be very helpful in detailing the options available to travelers in Europe. I know I will utilize it for and upcoming trip to Italy.
4,Practical & Spiritual,"We were very pleased with the format of this book. Not only is the book practical (it has the monastery contact information we were looking for), but it also approached the subject from a spiritual perspective - very important. The only disappointment, however, was that it didn't have any maps, which made it more difficult to find out where many of the places were located. But nonetheless, it's been very helpful for us, and we've also loaned the book out to friends who have also found it very helpful in making their travel plans. We give it four stars."
3,Not worth the trouble!,"I have purchased this item once before and have always been very impressed with it. But, this time when I ordered it, I did myself a favor!! I actually checked the shipping costs. WHOA!!! The shipping cost was only $2 less than the product. Never again! I will not waste my money on shipping for this product. I think the Blitz Company should be ashamed of themselves. The light weight of this item does certainly not warrant the amount of postage.Very unhappy customer."
5,best D'Amato yet!,"Lean, mean, and funny. This mystery/sci-fi concoction got it just right -- had me page-turning, chilled, laughing, contemplative about our future, all at the same time. And the New York City ambience is top-drawer. I could feel the energy of the city -- the music, the traffic, the crush -- on lots of pages (I've been to NYC many times, and love it). Eagerly looking forward to Levinson's next."
2,Two pouty-lipped girls decide to act spoiled. They succeed.,Two pouty-lipped girls decide to act spoiled. They succeed.Sometimes visually creative and interesting but never compelling. Also rather food-obsessed.
2,Crashes,"I have had this cfor 4 years and it is a decnt computer for the price, but it has hame extremely upset when it crashed the second time. This Emachines is very unreliable and I would not recommend it to anyone that wants a good computer."
3,Need Glue,"These headphones are somewhat comfortable with moderate sound quality, minimal bass response. The head cushion on my set keeps falling off which is annoying. I've tried every type of glue, the head cushion will not stay put. Detachable cable is a nice feature. Not as comfortable as I would like as I am always aware that they are on my head. They are worth the price but in my opinion there are better options, see Koss brand."
2,great idea to put them together but the sound is very dry .,"Very dry sound, it hurts my ear.It plays like poor AM radio sounds."
4,"Not Bad, a good read","I enjoyed the book and found it really interesting especially the complex, quasi father/son relationship between Woodward and Felt. The book has now created another mystery, instead of ""Who was Deep Throat?"" it's now, ""Why was he Deep Throat?"". Because of Felt's advanced age and alzheimer's, we'll never know. I would recommend this book to anyone that lived through that part of history or is interested in that part of it."
3,Deep Throat,"I enjoyed the book, but I do not think it added much to what we already knew about ""Deep Throat."" His coming out prior to this book being published removed all the suspense as to his identity."
2,A disappointment,"The good parts of the story are already in All the President's Men. The new material is Oprah-ready filler about a young man and his source. Woodward has not (dares not?) thought very deeply about Mark Felt, his motives, or his trustworthiness. This is the same incomplete Watergate story that his the papers in 1973.I know journalists can only write the first draft of history. But Woodward is still selling that same first rough draft three decades after the events took place."
3,Made in China what happened to made in England?,"It is a beautiful piece, but I am not happy that it is made in China.I don't believe that they hold their value when made in China. All of my other pieces are made in England."
1,Bad Quality,"Bad quality. I use a mircocassette recorder. These tapes have such bad quality, I am unable to use them and get consistent sound playback. The sound dips and raises to a point, that on the dips, I can't hear whats being said. Stay away from these. I don't know if it's because they were inexpensive but my Memorex weren't like this and they were pretty cheap too. I will not buy this brand again."
2,One problem with this dog trolley,"Seller calls this a ""medium"" dog (at 30 pounds) tie out leash?Our vet says our dog is ""medium"" at 40 pounds. I am now forced to pay them for a heavier leash to secure my dog who is anything but large.My advice: Their lightest leash should handle dogs up to 50 pounds....what's the big deal...why not charge a few bucks more?Tom Mathews"
4,Xceptional Single,"I love this song. It has VERY smooth female vocals and a good techno beat that makes the song a ton better than the original slow version from when they were Plumb. I have heard some remixes of this done in Orlando FL that were better than this mix, but this is still one of my favorite *slower* (compared to some songs like Darude's Sandstorm etc) dance songs. (and this is about the only mix of this song that you will be able to find to buy)."
2,Not the one!,"I'm very disappointed with this title, so much talk where not necessary, examples that not directly related to the subject in hand, chapters introductions as if author is writing an article in a newspaper not for a professional developers, Authors seem to know their stuff very well but there is a difference between knowing the material and authoring a book, clearly they doesn't have that talent. I can't dare to compare this book to Jeff Prosise masterpiece ""Programming Microsoft .NET"", but I found O'Reilly's Programming ASP.NET book a much organized and useful book, don't waste your time and money on this one!"
4,This is a unique CD,"I have been looking for a copy of ""You're Just in Love"" by Perry and the Fontane Sisters that I could afford for several years. I was delighted when this CD was finally cut. This is a great Berlin song done in an outstanding manner. There are scores of other Perry CD's but this is the only one with this song. You also get some other really good songs ie ""Play Me a Hurtin Tune"", ""Rollin Stone"". Too bad that this is the only CD with the Fontane sisters on it. They sing beautifully. Perry aint bad either."
2,water toy,We loved these water toys at the pool BUT they came apart within a day or two of use. Then they were no good as the batteries get wet and rust the insides. Did not last long enough to be worth the cost!
2,Not as well made as one would hope,"Not sure I am a huge fan of the layout of the pack, although it does serve its purpose. The downside, unfortunately, is it has started to fall apart barely a year and a half after buying it. I had a Speedo pack last me over 12 years, going through a plethora of abuse and this bag is already starting to tear. I'll give it four stars for design, but deduct two for poor craftsmanship. Hope others have had better luck, but it is not like I throw this thing around or it fell off the back of a truck. I have to think the sun and hot weather caused the issue at hand. Will start using my Gregory Backpack from now on."
2,Not too sturdy,It took my dog about three minutes to chew the strap off of this and then eat a hole in the side to remove the squeaker. If your dog is good at destroying dog toys like mine you should probably stay away from this one.
5,Great language based activities for any child,"Being a teacher myself, I was very impressed with the language based activities in this book. Even if you were not to do the ASL and just do the activities to help your child learn English, they would be great activities. This is important to me since my daughter is HOH (hard of hearing) and I want to make sure I am not only teaching her ASL, but also exposing her to lots and lots of English at the same time.I am currently trying to figure out how to get trained to be a Signing Smart instructor since there are none in my area; this shows how impressed I am with this book.With this book and our Signing Time! videos, we are quickly learning many signs. My 8 month old is just starting to sign ""more"" and ""eat"" and ""milk""."
4,be prepared for an emotional roller coaster,"like almost every japanese anime series, this ones also pretty damn sad by the time you are done, people dieing ect ect, wont spoil the plot but its a very good watch, that will leave you grieving the people by the end of it."
1,If you enjoy hitting your head against a tree this is the anime for you!,"This is something I am embarrased to own. The storyline is pethetic, about a mafia owning genetically modified dead people and taking over a city. The scenes skipped about randomly and it constantly reviewed itself making it like a clipshow of the episode before adding only a few new scenes.The supposed good point of the show is the friendship shared by the main characters Brandon Heat and Harry Mcdowel. They end up getting in a lovers quarral about loyalty to the mafia and try to kill one another. Here is the dumber part, they both succeed! This anime was utter torture to watch through and was honestly a waste of my life I will never get back.I pray that you do not suffer the same fate I have,"
2,not my favorite game,"i race a porsche so i think i know what racing a real car is like . i have played and completed every racing game that works with a force feedback wheel, games like all the needforspeed games , gt3 and gt4. i finished this game in 9 days and i was not very happy with it . my biggest complaint is that as you go up in the levels your competitors dont get faster thay just run into you more to make you crash out . real racing is not like that at all ! the car setup is not all that good ! the brakes stink my bicycle stoppes better than the cars in this game. on a good note i did think the rallying is better than what it is in the gt4 game and i did like most of the tracks .if you like to have the other cars take you out of a race then get this game ."
1,Dont Bother!,"I purchased this as a gift, and was very disappointed when I opened it! It says ""large"" in the description, and it barely held my hand-held camcorder, nevermind a large camera!! It is very small w/little room for accessories. Very unsatisfied!"
2,A Long Winded Political Harangue,"This book combines a terrific idea and well crafted writing with an a boring, constant political harangue. In short, the island of Nantucket is transported to the Bronze Age. Luckily for this island group, the population is a cross section of just those skills a society would need living in the Bronze Age! Lucky indeed. Oddly from my pov, the author insists on making heros out of the strangest people. The political leader is a tyrannt, the military leader a strange neurotic lesbian who abandonned her family to captain a Coast Guard ship (right). The most interesting and sympathetic person is the first officer of the ship who runs a string of bad luck almost as unlikely as the 'good' guys run into good. Throughout the book, the author berates us with modern US far left liberal beliefs as being the only true and shining path for this group to take. That is, unless the subject is the native population who exist to either obey or die."
3,good effort - interesting alternate history,Could do without the transparently manipulative gratuitous sex and violence. Also - the layouts in chapters between the protagonists and antagonists were awkward and distracting. Good research was done here.
4,island in the sea of time,"Just enough science fiction to set up a very interesting situation---modern man meets ancient man (from 3000 years ago) in both settings. I am halfway through now, and look forward to the adventures in each chapter. If you like this type of thing, this is a good one."
5,Action! Historical Detail! Characters! Plot!,"I've read the other reviews and I agree with most of what they've written. But I've got to say that this is one of the best books I've ever read. Okay, the-oh-so fortunate presence of the Coast Guard ship might be a bit contrived, but what would the story be without it? Kirk and Picard ain't got a patch on Captain Marion Alston. Not only is it a powerful rich story about time displacement and history, but it's also about humans doing what they do best: Surviving in the face of terrible odds. I can't wait to read the rest of Mister Stirling's work. It was the kind of book where you didn't want it to end because you don't want to leave the characters behind."
4,"Good research, good story","I've read all three in this series and I agree with many of the comments below:1. Maps! Yes! Put some damn maps in this thing. I'm lucky that I have a good background in history, but I still found myself looking things up to get a sense of place and distance. Maps would definitely help.2. Kurelo women -- the relationship drags on and on which is fine, but I don't want to hear about it anymore!3. The Event, other implausibles and unexplained happenings -- who cares? This is SF (speculative fiction). Stirling did a good job not making it too much of a focus and just getting to the real story here -- survival in the past. It's not like this stuff is Hugo material -- it's just fun. If you can't handle it -- don't read it."
1,Philosophical dictionaries should be about philosphy,"I was very offended to spend money to hear someone who uses a Philosphical Dictionary to ''Announce one's personal faith in Jesus Christ'' ....... If Mr. Adler wishes to proselytize, a dictionary of philosphy terms, or any kind of a dictionary is not the place to do it, in my opinion. ..... I wasted my money!"
2,A Journey Of Friendship,I have read many books on hiking the trail.This one is poorly written and not very exciting.You do not get drawn into the experience like someother books.
4,Pictures could be updated overall good,"This is an awesome book, so thorough though the pictures could be updated from the 70s and not be so cheesy. Otherwise great learning tool."
5,A Child Is Born - gives a view into the miracle of birth,This book gives the expectant parents a peek into the miracle of having a baby. Ideal for first-time parents ... and grandparents as well!
2,Way too graphic!,"I was so disappointed by this book. I purchased it for myself and my sister-in-law as pregnancy gifts.The photos of the baby in utero are Amazing, but there was no need to include photos of couples in bed together - and the photos of laboring women towards the end of the book were obscene. It was completely unnecessary to show completely nude women - it is very possible to labor & deliver a baby while mostly clothed (I've done it).These photos really detracted from the beauty of the story of the growing fetus.Needless to say, I returned the books and found something less offensive."
4,Un Poco de Todo,"Se ha convertido en uno de mis favoritos!A pesar de no ser aficionado del bachata ...siento bien escuchar la voz de Mickey.Ademas, sus arreglos son de corte sencillo, peroaltamente agradables.Lo mas cachimbon es que sus discoscontienen variedad de ritmos.Salsa, bachata y merengue!Que mas quieres corazon?Nota;Pues, he bajado la guardia y tambienestoy agarrando la honda del bachatafaltaba menos."
2,Born a Healer,Very simplistically written. Interesting topic and examples but the first part is way too elementary and self serving of the author. Some new information but not riveting.
2,"Great guy, so so book","Well, if you are looking to do spring forest qigong don't start here. If you want to learn about qigong or energy healing, don't start here either. If you can't sleep at night because you want to know more details about Chunyi then get the book. You will sleep well. Otherwise skip it and go to the DVDs from the spring forest qigong website."
5,Totally awesome story,I borrowed this book and couldnt bare to return it! A must have in my library. A natural progression is to move onto DVDs and CDs. Very healing and so genuine.
3,May improve with use,"I have used an Omelet pan for years to make cornbread in. I pour a little oil in both sides and coat the pan well, and pour the batter in, and set on lowest setting on stovetop. I flip it over after about 10 mins or so, (I can tell by looking if it's ready to flip) This pan looks and feels EXACTLY like my old one, but my old one looks so old. I have tried to make my cornbread in this pan 2 times so far, it burns before it gets done. I am going to try turning the burner off part of the time next time I try it out, but for now I went back to old one."
2,Bought this for my husband,"Thoughtvthis would be great, but even though he asked for it, he hasn't used it. It looks very nice and it is probably a good thing. Really hard to store."
1,Xylon coating on Norpro omelet pan,"I followed the instructions for ""seasoning"" the pan. The xylon coating melted and became a tarry substance that was difficult to remove from my sink when I tried to wash it. The acrid smoke filled the kitchen! What a waste of money and health hazard!!! Don't purchase it."
3,Good product.,I used it on my 1997 toyota tacoma 3.4L v6. On some of the cam shaft lobes near the cam bearing cap it couldn't be used do to lack of space. The tool make it easier and a lot cheaper than a snap-on or toyota special tool. Also I will only use it for this one or two time so the cost of this tool was important. It was the cheapest I found.
3,"good tool, good price","Although this did not fit over the cam lobe on my 3.0 supra turbo cams, I was able to make it work. I think the description should tell what size cams or what models it will work on. The depressing tool does seem to be flimsy but I had no trouble with it bending in any way. For the price its worth a try."
3,"if you freeze, lids break","These are good; the space saving works great. Can always find your lids and has a good selection of container sizes. However, I disagree that they are freezer safe. Once you've frozen leftovers a few times, the lids break. The containers and lids are thin, not as nice as Rubbermaid or whatever, but that did not seem to impact the functionality until, as I said, you froze them. Also, they will break when frozen if dropped. Would I buy again? No... Am I sorry I bought them? No..."
2,Not so much...,"All in all not a horrible album, but their Pink Floyd The Wall ending to the CD seemed about as appropriate as a fart in church."
2,What's so special?,"Im a guy who's been listening to dance music through the whole 90's and i've certainly heard funnier things in my days then ""Dirty Vegas"". So much hype about them lately so i decided to take a look at their debut cd eventhough they haven't had much airplay and dance music radio station or on TV. I was honestly not very impressed, many songs are nice but nothing i would pay to have, this is really a good relax music though, just lay back and i promise you will sleep in a few minutes, most songs are slow with hardly any lyrics either. ""Candles"" is a example of a song with lyrics though, it sounds like a mix of underworld and stereophonics, ""the brazilian"" is one of a few rougher songs, with faster beats and sample's. I can't say more then that this cd was very dissapointing, been there done that. Nothing new for me."
4,"British? Whatever it is, its got my attention.","Face it, one cannot escape this CD, but its for all the good reason, too. Dirty Vegas is a ultimately creative pop act, reminiscent to the UK acts New Order and Underworld. Rather easy to latch onto, the tracks on here make excellent background music and blend into the scenery of life (eg, its good for driving).We may think we have heard it before; for the most part, we have, what with all the anthemic tunes those UK arena-techno bands created in the early 90's, but Dirty Vegas injects a clean breath of fresh air into this vein of music. Dirty Vegas proves themselves as an established act in memorable UK techno."
3,good but not great,"Being a techno/house/etc. fan, I was intrigued when this group of three brits started getting famous over here. I don't usually hunt for music in car commercials, but whatever...Days Go By was a catchy song. And so, for the most part, is the rest of their cd. If you're looking for more ""Days Go By"" sounds, then this album is for you. If you're looking for something dramatically different or inspired, I wouldn't recommend it. The album mostly consists of simplistic beat tracks with sonorous voices coming in and out and the occasional acoustic, which admittedly is a welcome sound that fits well with their lyrics...all of which are broad and hit the spot in the uplifting category. A good listen, and for those who aren't hardcore into the genre, a great cd. But if you're looking for something amazing...sorry, no can do."
3,Too Dirty or Not Dirty Enough?,"Dirty Vegas brought to us an okay album, it's not quite the best and requires improvement. Don't get me wrong I think the beats are great and Dance friendly, but I wouldn't go as far as to say that these songs consist of good lyrics. I personally don't think this album has the quality of something one would play non-stop in their stereo. None of the songs on this album live up to the hit single ""Day's Go Buy"", the other songs lack the catchy lyrics and the unique beats. This fact is backed up with the acoustic version of ""Day's Go Buy"", which is a bonus 12th track. The acoustic version is extremely well proving that the song its self with its lyrics is fantastic, no other song on this album promises that. There are a few catchy songs on this album, but none that are that catchy enough for me to even mention. I think Dirty Vegas has potential but we didn't get the best of it with this debut album. I'm sure Dirty Vegas will grow in time."
