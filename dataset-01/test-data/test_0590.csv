2,I watch and listen to movies how about you.,"I judge the picture quality to be worthy of five (5) bright stars.I judge the sound quality to be worthy of (1)shabby star.I have to admit the looks of the player itself and the looks of the images it displays are amazing. However, I am still in disbelief over the volume of the mechanical whirring sound the player needs to emits in order to play a movie. I stopped and started the player a half dozen times to see if the 2nd, 3rd, or fourth time would be the charm that eliminated the noise. The sound the player generates to spin the disc is ridiculous. I wasn't going to try and ignore the sound or try and turn the volume on the player up to mask the sound. I returned the player."
4,"Works Fine, but didn't see much range boost!","This unit replaced a regular Linksys USB wireless; it seems to work fine, but, to tell the truth, I didn't see much difference in distance or signal strength."
4,Romans in Britain,"The title of this video ""Romans and Barbarians"" is, perhaps, too grand for the scope. (And perhaps too grand for a fifty minute treatment).Principally the video covers the Roman invasion of Britain, and the barbarians of the title are the Celts who inhabited the island.Visuals are good. The principal ""interviewee"" is a professor of miitary history at Sandhurst and the video includes discussion of Roman military organization, weapons and tactics. The time covered is from the reconnaisance in force by Caesar through the invasion of Claudius, and up to the suppression of the resisting tribes.Worth the money, as long as you understand the scope"
1,Another Warping From Llewellyn,"Once again, Llewellyn is making the ignorant mistake of equating Brujeria with the Wiccan religion. Wicca is NOT the Brujeria of today--there's already a longstanding tradition called Brujeria which remains the Brujeria of today, thank you. The text is obviously a rote translation from English into Spanglish, with all of the fire of a Babelfish translation. The more I read Llewellyn's titles in Spanish, the more alarmed I become at how little thought seemd to go into the translation. But the bottom line---NO, la Wicca no es la Brujeria de hoy. La Brujeria es la Brujeria de hoy!"
3,"The book is a classic, but this used copy was lacking","This is a wonderful, classic book that I enjoyed during my childhood. I purchased this copy to share the love with my 4-year-old daughter. I was on the page for the hardcover edition, and was offered a choice of several vendors to purchase used. What arrived was a paperback edition, and not in very good condition at that. Disappointed in the vendor, but the book itself is a great story."
1,Might work for you; didn't work for me,"I've been taking this regularly for more than a month and can tell absolutely no difference in any of the physiology the manufacturer suggests. I didn't even get a placebo effect.But I understand this type of supplement can produce results in some, but not in others. I hope it does better for you than me."
1,"cute, but not worth it","The Nike Presto is stylish and cute, but not worth the money. It hurt to wear and the strap/bracelet broke after only two weeks. I wouldn't buy it again."
4,great concert footage and interview,Been waiting in anticipation for this one! My only complaint is the SHORT concert footage! Why not include the entire show? Otherwise this is an awesome DVD. I highly reccomend for any fan of this incredible band. Can't wait for the next studio album!
1,The Family,"I ordered for the CD (audio), took a long time to get, then the album showed up. Rather than complaining again for something that I had waited a month for, I kept the album and will not order from these people again. A total of $99.00 was wasted when I placed an order for a CD and got a album, very disappointed.PSWhat was the point of returning it, it took a long time getting the family, so I just kept it, I had the album a long time ago, I knew the music was good, I ordered a CD. In any event keep my money I will give the album to someone else or get rid of it. Thank you."
5,The best movie music!,"I have seen American Beauty two times all the way through, and parts of it probably at least ten times. The music really is a major part of the movie, that sets everything. It's all just perfect for the characters feelings, thoughts, and actions. It all fits so well. I just got this CD, the score, for Christmas and I can't stop listening to it. Every time I do, I think back to the individual parts in the movie where the music was played. Then, also, the music just by itself, even if it wasn't part of the movie, is so wonderful. Some people I know who have listened to it and seen the movie, they didn't like the movie and didn't want to be brought back to the scenes of it from the music. I guess they just can't see the actual beauty of the music itself. But this CD is so incredible. I am very happy to own it and listen to it constantly. My favorite song is American Beauty, I love the piano in it. The only other thing I can say is to go out and buy this CD, you'll love it."
3,ver quick delivery,"Extremely quick delivery to South africa, thats very far. thanx. product was exectly waht I asked for and what was advertised."
4,Really good soundtrack,"This is just wonderful and compelling. Well written, perfectly executed.I didn't give it 5 stars because the CD doesn't stand on its on in terms of music I would listen to. It's just too one-dimensional.But as a soundtrack, it's awesome."
3,"Not a great soundtrack, though great music was featured in","the film. I liked the score and all the songs in the film, but this soundtrack lacks some of the best ones, e.g. ""American Woman"" and Annnie Lennox's song. ""American Woman"", in my opinion, was crucial to the film. I think a good sountrack should include all the important songs and that is why I give this CD three stars."
1,Who's Giving Jakatta the Credit?!!!!,"Thomas Newman may be good at sound editing and selecting great songs for great movies, but please don't give him credit for the songs!! David Lee, the brain behind the theme songs to Shawshenk Redemption and American Beauty didn't recieve the credit that he should have. If you want a real soundtrack, purchase his Album Jakatta: Visions."
3,"Good source of PL/SQL info, but too many errors","This is a good book on Oracle8 PL/SQL. The book has two weak sides though: firstly, a lot of errors, and secondly, poor description of Oracle8 related features. The book is written around older version of PL/SQL with new features added in a hurry."
1,A perfect example of a low quality work,"This book is a perfect example of a low quality Oracle Press work. Errors are prevailing -- starting from the Chapter PL/SQL Basics. Many paragraphs look similiar to those in the Oracle PL/SQL User's Guide and Reference, with wording slightly modified -- very often producing errors and confusions."
4,"Good reference, not as good learning","I started out learning PL/SQL with this book but switched to ""Teach Yourself PL/SQL in 21 Days."" I found the latter much better for learning. The chapters were broken up into reasonable lenghts and it had lots of examples. Oracle8 PL/SQL Programming looks more complete but its organization better for use as a reference text than for learning."
2,removes eyelashes with removal,"Everything was fine with this until I went to remove it. It comes off in clumps, which got stuck to my eyelashes. While trying to remove the clumps, my eyelashes came with it!"
1,Worst Eyeliner. Ever.,"The only good things I can say about it are the brush is thin and the product goes on easily. HOWEVER - less than two hours after putting it on, it is flaking and then it starts peeling off in chunks. I do not put a lot on, and only one layer. I've given it a couple tries, and every time it starts to flake within a couple hours. It's going in the garbage."
5,Acid Test: Kids want to hear it again and see the pictures!,"What a great book for me to use in our Rotary Club sponsored reading program with Will Rogers School in Altus, Oklahoma. I enjoy reading and making the farm sounds to the 1st grade class. We, (members of the business community), read twice a week to show how important reading is to us. This book is one of my favorites because it gives them a positive experience with a book. Plus, I love to see them smile and hear them laugh!"
3,BIG red bear,"This is a cute bear, but I was surprised out how large it was. The bear is about as wide as it is tall! (20"" tall measured in the sitting position, and 19"" wide) Bits of the red fur have come out where the bear has been handled, so I am not sure how long it will last. It is very cute and soft."
5,Enjoy it as a classic movie,"Dragonlance is the classic 80's campaign for D&D.; It is the occasion for you to enjoy this beautiful saga.Dragons of Despair is the beginning if the saga. Heroes gather after long wanderings at Solace, the small city build of their childhood. They're going to meet 2 new fellows who bring the first clue about the lost gods of the world. An incredible journey should conduct the PCs to the sunken city of Xak Tsaroth. At the same time, tales of war and slaughter come from north along with streams of refugees. Rumors tell that Dragons are rising in the skies again..."
2,many missing songs,"When i watched Play It To The Bone movie, i told to my self ""oh god i must own this soundtrack."" there are lot of cool musics played in the movie. But when i listened i wonder where were the rest of them. Especially the Moby's songs.Moby's two songs are missing one of them is; Memory Gospel. And the other one is Bedhead. And Bedhead can't be found anywhere. In my thought it played when the two boxers make ready themselves in their training room. but i'm not sure.The other missing is some kind of rap song; Fred Tucker's Step Aside. When Tyson (or his stunt) comes to Mandalay...Thanks god that they put Moby's Machete."
3,Kids gift,"I bought this book as a gift. It looks like good quality and my nephew likes everything pokemon, he is 5. I think it is a good gift for him."
5,concert,"I went to James Blunt concert in Columbia MD last night and he was fabulous, stage performance was outstanding and his voice is very unusal its the last concert in America for 2006 and I'll bet he's exhausted. The last song of the evening was Your Beautiful and he belted it out with the audiance singing right along with him of course i did too!!!"
1,My wife bought it by accident,"I would never have bought this, and I hope it is not a popular version of his song. I don't particularly admire James Blunt's work, but the clean version of this song seems to be popular for the skill of it's making. That I would give it credit for."
4,cute on my sheppards hook,I had one of these about 10 years ago and it broke. I have been looking and looking ever since. I am so glad I found this.
4,"A delightful, meditative CD","This CD, the second the Adagio Trio has produced, is a delight to listen to. The pieces are arranged very well, the trio is well balanced, and the recording has a nice depth to it. The performances are quite good, reflecting the quality of each of the trio. The pieces are meditative, but not heavy or dark. They prompt a sense of relaxation and reflection, almost a sense of awe for the universe we live in, and the One who created it. It is a CD that, with their first one called ""Stillpoint"", has found a permanent spot in my CD player."
1,A Waste of Money,"I bought the Wharton's Stretching book and liked it, finding it very useful as a martial artist. This book, however, merely rehashes everything in the Stretching book, but in an inferior manner. Although it has photos instead of drawings, the Wharton's Stretch book clearly shows acceptable ranges of motion for each stretch. In addition, the Back Book has a section on training with weights that bordered on ridiculous. The author's clearly know little about neither weight training as therapy nor weight training for strength and flexibility. This book was a real disappointment. Buy their first book, avoid this one."
5,Wonderful Book,This is a wonderfully written book with beautiful illustrations. A pleasure to read to your child!
2,how to paint your car,"Typical over load on words pertaining to auto body shop repairs and prep for painting,""but lacks in information on painting a car. Out of 159 pages of print there is only 6 pages that actually decscribes anything that ressembles painting. I wish i had known this before i wasted my money. I would not recommend this book."
3,Kind of cheap,Cheaply made but gets the job done. Bought this because I wanted to thin my hair out myself. It is ok.
1,Don't waste your time/money - get a lawyer,"I purchased this book to help file forms on a stepparent adoption. I submitted the form that was included on the CD ""Petition to Terminate Parental Rights of the Alleged Father"". To my dismay, they told me that I was using an ""outdated"" template, as the Civil Code 7409(a) that was referenced was repealed 10 years ago. I sought help from an attorney who told me that this is now under Family Code Section 7611. I do not trust the forms now, as I fear there may be other mistakes that I do not know of, as I am not an attorney.I emailed Nolo to see if they had any updated version of this form, but did not get a reply.Trust me, save yourself time, money and frustration by getting proper legal advice from a family law attorney.DO NOT buy this book, or you may be embarrassed when you try to file your paperwork and it is marred with incorrect entries."
4,AWESOME book!,This book has all the info we need to complete the adoption. This book was recomended to us by our local law library.
2,Not nearly as good as original,"I bought 4 of these to replace the original batteries that gave up the ghost in my phones. It's hard to estimate this, but I'd guess they have about 15-20% of the capacity of the originals- in other words, not very good at all.I am constantly having to make sure that at least one of the phones is charged up, and often I end up with a dead phone in my hand. I'm not a teenager folks, and I don't live on the phone. This never happened with the original batteries. I certainly can't recommend these."
1,Worse than my old batteries,"I usually do not write negative reviews but this product is one of the few that gave me no choice.I simply needed to replace my aging batteries. As soon as I received the batteries (bought two), I charged them overnight and started using them. Immediately, I noticed the batteries don't perform as well as my old ones (when new), it drains rather quickly even if I don't use the phones much. Now, after two months of using them, it's to a point where the whole battery is drained within a day (which I suspect them are not holding any charge at all). I'm quite disppointed. Luckily, I haven't thrown away my old batteries and will switch them back now."
3,Don't believe everything you read,"This book is a fun collection of obscure ""facts"", but shouldn't be taken too seriously, as there are errors on almost every page. The Philco Predicta wasn't the first TV set made (it dates from 1958)... Those of us who watched Howdy Doody on NBC in 1950 will be surprised to hear that Captain Kangaroo was the first network TV kid show in 1954... Napoleon certainly didn't appoint Louis Pasteur to a committee to study food preservation for his invasion of Russia in 1812, since Pasteur was born in 1822... Nor is chi a letter of the Hebrew Alphabet.My favorite entry is the one for the legendary Betsy Ross, alleged not only to have made the first American flag, but to have designed it (!), and to have been born with a full set of teeth in her mouth (!!)."
1,WRONG,"The Answers to the questions are wrong!! For Examples - they state the largest lake in the WORLD is Lk. Superior.. Nope, Caspian Sea. (Please look up the word lake!!)"
4,"Nice Basket, just watch your handlebars!","It's a really nice basket, but there are a few things you should be aware of. If you plan on using it on a bike with drop bars make sure the bars are wide enough that the basket will fit inside. I had to wedge mine in which sounds bad but I don't ever use the bottom sections of the bars anyway, I just rest my hands on the brake hoods. Also, the mounting hardware has the basket sitting quite high off the wheel. Again, this would be better suited for a bike with mustache or sweep bars. I had wanted to mount the rack just above the front wheel (below the drop bars), I still might but it's going to mean buying a little front rack or working on a custom hardware adaptation. But the basket is great and I find it really useful. Go for it!"
4,Awesome Basket for the Price,"I love this basket. I originally bought an ""M-Wave Wide Wire Bicycle Basket"", and it was so flimsy that it got crushed in the mail. I don't use this for the front though, I use it for the back. The arms that come with it didn't meet the wheel where they were supposed to be attached (i have 26"" tires). But I had a back bike rack, so I mounted it to there and it works perfectly. Pretty shallow, but I attached a wire bungee net that keeps all of my stuff in securely."
5,The Best thing I have done for my bike!!,This little Wald basket is great! Perfect for carting a 6 pack of beer or a small bunch of groceries back from the store. It's very sturdy. I am so happy I don't have to carry stuff on my back anymore!
2,I had a hard time using the product. ...,I had a hard time using the product. I tried it twice and it never took my hair off. It was messy and didn't work! I recommend you buy a razor!
3,"ok....but ""off-color""","I was disappointed in the product's color. It was not ""white"" as it should have been, so apparently was left sitting on the shelf for a very long period of time. It was ""brownish tan"". It had an ""old"" smell, also. It did, however, appear to perform the same as the new product. I ordered the same product at the same time from another Amazon provider and received an apparently ""new"" product which was ""white"" and more pleasing to me."
2,Overated Bigtime,This book is advertised as an A+ cram book. It is nothing of the sort and doesn't even cover the exam domains well enough to pass. Especially Windows NT. Hope you have lots of lots of time. Your going to need it with this book. I have five years experience with PC's. I needed a small book to help me focus on the exam objectives quickly. There are better resourses that are better rated than this book.Good Luck...
3,great for someone who has never worked on a CPU,I used this book as my main study resource for the exam and i was shocked when i took the exam because of questions the book didn't even touch on. The book is full of corny jokes and advertising plugs. The analogies used are not the strongest. The diagrams are also very weak. I would recommend this book to someone who has never worked on a computer.
4,Buen producto,"MUy buen producto, lo recomiendo.. Me gusta, lo recomiendo ampliamente...Me gusta.. me gusta...Voy a comprar otra mas.. me gustaria"
5,A Must Have,I loved this book. It is well written and entertaining. It reads so fast that you don't realize how much you have read. Full of suspense and surprises that I didn't want to put it down. And it also gave me some inside information to Silicon Valley.
5,Fabulous!,"I love this CD! Even my three year old daughter sings along to Old Guitars. I asked for this CD for my birthday because I am a big Kevin Bacon fan, but it is the CD I listen to most often because it is wonderful."
1,Boring - Stupid,You never see her in costume that is on the cover. I like sex and distruction as much as the next guy but this movie just did not do anything for me. I found it stupid and boring.
4,Extremely worthwhile and authentic,"The author is totally familiar with this subject and he conveys its essence with skill and wit. The reader will come away with a new understanding of Chassidic thought and he will hear the melodies of the Chassidim with deeper understanding.The author's style is disarmingly naive, masking what must have been many months of laborious research. Few Chassidim know as much about these unique melodies as is contained in ths delightful work."
3,"Quite Good, but lacking in character","The album is successful in that it is entertaining, but really fails to caputre the energy given in the bands previous recordings."
4,it okay,it just another game of bingo. My 4 year is getting the point of how to play. Nothing too exciting.
2,"Stuff happens, but so what?","I really wanted to like this series, but I just couldn't. Lawhead failed to make me care about any of the characters and his pacing is uneven at best. One moment, he'll spend a chapter detailing everything that happens in a scene -- the next, he'll skip over months in a few sentences. I'm afraid I would have to recommend against buying this series. If you'll looking for Swords & Sorcery that deal well with a character growing up and coming to power, look at David Edding's Belgariad."
4,"A sea of knowledge, one centimeter deep","This book widely specifies WHAT to do in strategic planning but it hardly explains HOW to do it. What I expect when reading this kind of topics is not the concept but rather the application procedures and practical techniques for implementing those concepts in an effective and innovative way. In consequence, I found this book repetitive and non productive for planning specialists. However it may serve a lot to beginners and students."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS DVD!,"This dvd is very bad for mothers in the 2nd or 3rd trimester. Lying on your back puts all the weight of the uterus and baby on your lower spine. This video begins by not only asking you to lie on your back, but it asks you to lift your pelvis at the same time (adding insult to injury). The first set of exercises had me in so much pain, that I had to shut it off. I turned it off and put on The Method prenatal yoga video, which causes me to feel BETTER, NOT WORSE!! Finally, abdominal crunches are not safe during pregnancy. This video asks you to do those as well. Stay away!!"
2,Pilates for Pregnancy,"I bought this hoping that it would give me a good workout that would be safe during pregnancy. I would rate myself with an ""average"" level of fitness, and this didn't give me a good workout at all. I would imagine that someone who has never really exercised and is pregnant may benefit from this."
1,Horrid!,"Stilted instructor. Annoying music. *This* from the entertainment capital of the world? Why is this on DVD when it doesn't let me skip past all the annoying intros? Instructions are delivered separately from the exercises themselves, and after three of the exercises, I gave up and threw it away. I have taken several pilates classes over the years, and this one is awful."
3,Rune returns,"With this, the second novel to feature the bizarre Rune, Deaver once again tempers his hard-edge tale with Rune's usual wierdness and inexperience in the world of crime fighting.This time, Rune becomes obsessed with a porn star whose murder she witnessed. Armed with a camera and her quirky attitude, Rune dives into the porn industry and ferrets out clues and suspects ... and once again puts her life in mortal danger.Once again Deaver delivers a compulsively readable novel, but the twists in this one are more guessible than usual, especially the final (whichs shows Rune is kinder to certain people than they deserve) and next to no mention is made of the murders she experienced in the first book. Still, pretty good."
3,The Boyfriend List,"The Boyfriend list was pretty good to read. I would not suggest it to middle schoolers or fith graders. The book is about a girl whos life is in shambles, after her boyfreind broke up with her to go out with her best freind. Now nobody will talk to her and she has overly protective parents. I cant tell wether she is telling the story to the therepest or to us. She ends the story with a mildy happy ending and you can tell they want you to read the second and third book."
5,High quality children's software,"I was VERY impressed by both titles in the Play Time collection, especially Blue's Treasure Hunt. There are countless clickable surprises to discover as you, Steve and Blue range through the game world. (My 3 year-old was utterly delighted to spend half an hour clicking some blocks to stack them up, then clicking a toy car to knock them down.)One of the things I most appreciated about this and other Blue's games was the control and gameplay were designed to be maximally child friendly. The feedback level is effective and appropriate for little attention spans (e.g. if you misclick while trying to match a shape, a little buzz sounds and you're allowed to try again... no long sound or video tracks to wait through).Overall, a fantastic deal on two very high quality software titles."
3,My Dying Bride lose ground,"In the race for the title of the doom crown My Dying Bride lose ground with 34.7888% Complete with a sub-par release when compared with expectations. Upon first listen the most noticable loss is of the violin. Alas, Martin is no longer with the bad and the loss of this instrument hurts. It starts off nice enough with the first song. Almost Industrial vocals, they are distorted electronically. The album goes down hill from there with Heroin Chic being an all-time low for MDB fans. Base Level Erotica picks it up again with a catchy bass line and some interesting lyrics. The CD ends stong with the last song as the most memorable on the disc. One of the bands finer points. All in all, 2 songs a good CD does not make. I gave it 3 stars over 2 just because the 2 songs are really quite good though."
4,My son loves it!,"We bought this video as a souvenir after a ride on a train, but my son loves to watch it often (he's almost 4 now) Each letter has several video clips of real trains in action and he loves to tell me what letter and train is coming next when we watch it together."
1,Disappointed,"We bought this for our grandson. He already has ""Train Crazy Kids"" which he loves. ""The Alphabet Train"" uses exactly the same content that is in ""Train Crazy Kids""!! Same thing with Little Steps ""Adventure with Trains""! Obviously wouldn't have purchased if we had been made aware that all 3 of these DVDs are essentially the same thing."
4,A Practical Item,The Nail Brush is a great item. If you do a lot of manicure work including filing and buffing your fingernails this is an excellent item. It cleans and clears away debris and gets deep into crevasses. My only complaint is that some of the bristles come apart after each use. This is a great stocking stuffer!
4,they work well.,"us these to control humidity in my smaller box and it is very consistent. no complaints. easy to recharge, and while not as good as the beads, these are great for smaller boxes."
2,Would Not Buy Again,I have two of these in a 25 cigar humidor and they won't get the Rh above 63%. I feel like 2 of these should be doing a better job of getting it to the desired 72%. I will not buy another.2 stars for quick shipping.
4,"Good, not great","This gets the job done, keeps a pretty consistent humidity. But be prepared to use about 5 in a 100 cigar humidor. Use less than three and they need to be filled every few days to a week. I generally recommend them, but make sure you have enough if your not living the rain forest."
3,It's okay,"Perfect description is it's okay. Never quite sure how much they help your humidor. Seems like a very tight seal is required to get any benefit from these - once you have a good seal, they work to a certain degree. Good supplement. Expensive for what you get. Make sure you really need and or want these before ordering."
1,Flimsy plastic tube,The product arrived broken. It had been squashed and the bottom was broken open rendering the product useless for $10 + s&h. Not happy.
3,cool,it does work but i only give it three stars cause you need to use more than one tube. i need 3 for a cigar box sized for 30 cigars to get humidity up.
5,Great,These little sticks are great because they fit in desktop humidors very nicely and preserve space for more cigars. Anything bigger than a desktop humidor may take a few of these.
5,Does what its suppose to for a fraction of retail costs,"Not much to review here, it does what its suppose to. So simply follow directions and put in your humidor"
3,High altitudes affect humidity levels,"I purchased my first humidor with one of these tubes while living in Albuquerque at 6200' altitude. I could never get it to stay at approx 70 % but instead, would drop down to approx 60%. I recently moved to central California and have noticed that it now reads properly."
3,Not too sure--too much hype?,"We have 2 humidistats in our humidor and both read well below what they should be at, though the crystals in the tubes are 'filled' (we have 2 of those in the humidor, also. I don't know that these are very effective. We have a very small 25-50 cigar humidor that is opened about every 2 weeks."
4,great,this is very good summer time beach music Although not for punks like most of the stuff on this lable but this is great beach party music
3,Crappy Gift,"For a gag gift, this falls short. The reindeer wouldn't talk at first and then when it started working it was so muffled that we could hardly understand it. The 'poop' candy even tasted terrible."
5,This is Brian McKnight at his Best!!!,"Any Fan of Brian or R&B Music has to get this! Wonderful scenic scapes, and Brian McKnight singing some of his greatest songs unplugged with Band or just to the sound of himself playing the guitar. I'm a big B. McKnight Fan from Germany and I hope to see more Releases like this from i.e. Joe, because I rate him to be as much as a virtuoso as Brian. Keep Up the good work!"
2,Fits but needed tweaks!,"Bought for chevy cobalt install, holes and instructions all match up but my double din didnt fit in the opening! Took a blade and sandpaper to shave off a few milimeters so that it could go on! And yes i slid it on from the back not over the front screen which is purposely bigger than the rear of the head unit! Installed a Boss brand double din touch screen."
3,CSI and Vista,"i was unaware that these wouldnt work in vista when i ordered. not the sellers fault, but im stuck with em and cant use em"
5,Csi game,"My grand daughter who is 11, just loved it. She solved all of them and can't wait for more. She enjoys the challenge and she is also learning a great deal from each case. Great game that makes you use your brain and all your senses.AA++"
4,Pleased Grandmother in California,"This was perfect for my 3 year old grandson for Christmas. This 12"" bike should be a great one for him to learn to ride without the training wheels because he can balance himself by putting his feet down. He has a 14"" bike that he still needs help getting onto.Only problem was the front plackard with the flashing lights. The holders snapped off while trying to get them on. Grandpa thinks he can rig something else up to keep it on.We are very happy with the product."
3,"Not bad, but 3cd set is a lot better","The Silver Anniversary album is NEW stuff, done in the 90's. The 3CD package, soon to be reissued in early '99--supposedly--has tons of the old stuff, and is amazing. If you can, get both, but I'd wait for the box set to hear them for the first time."
2,Poor Quality!!!,"The only thing good about this DVD is that it is classical Pilates technique. The DVD is very poorly produced. The performer, Melinda Bryan herself, is clad in all black outfit which it made it very difficult to see her body. She was the only performer in the DVD which does not allow one to see how the exercises could look on another body. The studio is poorly lit and the camera never changes angles so that the viewer can see the exercise from a different angle. In addition, the verbal cues felt rushed and no modifications were given for any of the exercises on the DVD (Level II if you are familiar with classical or NY Style).There are much more better produced videos out there to supplement mat classes when one is unable to take class or a private session. I would recommend looking into Romana's Pilates or the Bob Liekens set. Don't waste your money or time with this one."
5,Used in my Primo grill,Lets just say you won't be disappointed. It's up to you on how creative you want to be to season the bird but I used poultry seasoning and injected it with 50/50 apple juice and white wine. 14lbs bird finished in 3 hours @ about 350 degrees. Family loved it and can't wait to do it again. Of course I have the ceramic grill so that will help. If you use gas or a weber it may not turn out as great but still worth a shot. Just put it in a pan and add more juices so it will boil and evaporate into the bird.
1,Good in theory,"Good in theory however:a) Tube is cut at an acute angle at the top, leaving a sharp edge that cut my thumbb) Turkey is difficult to position correctly due to two prongs that extend off the sides of the turkey cannon. These are not shown in the company's pictures online or in the directions. Are we supposed to stick them INTO the meat of the turkey somehow?c) Directions do not instruct one to remove the plastic leg securing thingy that is included with most supermarket turkeys"
4,Great little sandbox.,"Lid does not stay on as tight as I would like, but otherwise it is a great little sandbox at a very resonable price."
4,nmickowski@wilmingtontrust.com,this was bought for my grandaughter who is 22 mos. old. it is the right size for her. very durable
4,awesome video; companion being the key word,"Aziza does not actually teach steps or choreography in this video. But as a practice enhancement it is a wonderful addition to my collection. She uses what I would call ballet terms. She doesn't explain some things; she assumes you have some background. I am in my 20th week of a belly dance class and there were a couple of things I said ""what?"" to. But for the most part a basic understanding is enough. I find the 'choo choo' a bit challenging. I love the Jumanna (sp?) points for chest and hips. She does the Egyption straight-legged shimmy which I wasn't used to, but my shimmy has improved (I think). She is facing you in the video, several students have their back to you. When says ""your right"" she is actually using her left. I find that helpful. Overall, I love this view and Aziza is her usual charming self. At the end she performs two dances."
2,Did not help with slipping... maybe made it worse,"Based on the reviews I figured I had a 50-50 chance of this working and although it did not, it was a cheap experiment!I am not sure if they changed the formula or something or perhaps it depends on the climate? Here in warm and humid Florida I might as well have put vaseline on his paws! To me the description on the can makes no sense as I can not imagine something that would condition AND prevent slipping? These seem like contrary processes, but maybe it is just me though. I gave it two stars because I suspect this would make his pads softer. Also I was afraid he would just try to lick it off which he does with other ointment type things, but he did not seem inclined to do that which is a good thing."
2,Paw Wax,Great thought but product a bit disappointing. As much as you pay for this tiny bit of wax that doesn't even seem to spread smoothly on the paw or stay on- The only good thing going is it has a decent smell compared to the other paw treatments out there.. returned and wouldn't buy again.
4,So far so good,"As other reviewers have discussed, I got this product for an old dog who has problems slipping on bare floors. My 14yr. old black lab has lately had a lot of trouble getting up and down and getting around in general. I received the Excel paw protector yesterday, and after one application it seems to have helped considerably. She still slips a little when standing up, but much less than before, and in general is more sure-footed. I will definitely continue to use.I do have two negative comments, although they are minor. First the cover to tin of paw wax does not seal tightly (it was actually off when I opened the box). Because of this the wax was hardened on the surface, which made application a little harder, and may have made it less effective. The second is a general beef I have with Amazon in that they use excessive packaging for everything. This little tin of wax was sent in a box that could have fit 30 tins in it. A medim sized envelope would have worked fine."
5,kicker sub,"i bought this speaker for my 85 chevy truck, limited room in the cab. first let me say im using a bridged 600 watt ab boss 2 channel amp, the 450 chaos extreme and this little sub pounds hard, i mean HARD. i know its not broke in yet i just got it yesterday, my amps at 75% input and 25% bass boost set to about 110 on the frequency on low pass, my stereo goes from 0 to 50 on my sony head unit(real sony not walmart) and at 32 it hammers and hits all the notes and all the frequencies and if its too low to be audible you better believe you can feel it thanks to the ported box. no need for two subs with this dude. honestly if you need more bass theres something wrong with you cause this dude shakes my eyeballs :)"
2,missing basic information,"I have some excellent Lark books on ceramics, but this book was a disappointment. There is no almost no discussion of the potentially serious health hazards of working with soapstone (rock dust, asbestos) and how to minimize risks. The project directions are somewhat repetitive. A more indepth discussion of the geology and history of soapstone would have been interesting. Information on sources of carving stone and tools would have been useful."
3,The Cd-Room is great but...,The CD- room is user friendly and thats good when you have to study a lot and need something easy .. But The figures in the book never had the zoom or the Microscopy resolution with every slide in the book. And well Is important to know that kid of information specialy if you are interested in microscopy
5,perfect,use as an in-class reference for lab. Students don't get enough microscope time or know what they're looking at. No one needs more words to read that don't say anything new.
5,This is a great histology textbook.,"This book was my assigned text in medical school. This book goes over all the squamous epithelial cells you can think of. It has interesting information that is easier to learn then other subjects. Histology is definitely one of my favorite courses in med school. This book is written on a high level. Yes, it requires some comprehension. However, without this book, I would have failed my histology class. From advice of one of the previous reviewers, I also bought, ""Histology Study Guide"", isbn 0971999686. This study guide was definitely very helpful for test preparation. It gets right to the point."
3,Groom Your Room,"I think that this book has some great ideas, but American girl could of been more creative.C'mon, now I know just about every tip from this book. The tips are common, widespread. They oviously listened to a bunch of three year olds."
3,"Fine, I guess","So I purchased this egg, even though it was more expensive, because I thought it was the entire set of 4. Its not. Its 1 egg. Its a fine egg I guess. Does the trick. Just know, that you can get ONE egg, for cheaper."
2,Picture is Misleading,"The egg itself is fine, but it's only 1 egg. I think the picture is misleading. I was placing an order from my phone and the print is small and I was in a hurry so I ordered. 1 egg for $6 is ridiculous!"
2,philips headphones,"the biggest draw with this set of headphones is that the cord more like a rope and its much much less likely to get tangled. and its pretty light. sound was decent. however, i tried tirelessly to get it to fit around my ear in an optimal position so that it would stay on and in my ear while running. i couldnt. i wanted to really get it working bc of the rope-like cord but just couldnt"
3,"A fine DVD, but why so short","Production quality is stellar. Inclusion of several new performances, especially Steve Hackett with Horizon,s, is a definite treat. Including the entire performance of Afterglow would definitely have been better. The documentary proper only runs 100 minutes. What could have been an excellent chance to offer fans an in-depth look at one of the best progressive rock bands is lost. Band members are interviewed separately throughout the documentary. At least one group session would have been nice to see."
4,Interesting and Insightful,"Whether you were a fan of the old Genesis with Peter Gabriel or the more popular Genesis of the Phil Collins days, you will find this history of the band fascinating. It covers everything from the band's inception in the 60s to the breakup several years ago. Rare clips include early concert performances with Gabriel in his trademark costumes and makeup crooning some of the band's most beautifully strange and complex songs. All of the original members are interviewed, providing an articulate and insightful look into one of the world's most original bands."
1,A a waste of time and money,"This DVD is titled ""songbook"" when it should be called ""talkbook"" . Too much talk and not enough music . Only snippets or teasers that are rudely interupted with more talk . Save your money cause if you think you are getting music here , you are sadly mistaken ."
2,Disappointed,"I bought this for a valentine's gift for my wife and was very disappointed to discover the tracks as listed on the front were mere snippets in-between the interviews with the band.I had expected the music tracks to be present and complete instead of the 95% interviewing it has. If you read the front cover it discloses ""features cuts from"". Good if you want to purchase a documentary on Genesis I suppose so I gave it 2 stars and not 1."
4,A.M. puts the YEAH in ye-ye,"A fantastic blend of garage and exotica, Chick Habit is long on pleasure with only a tinge of guilt. this retro-pop record is so flawlessly executed and recorded, you'll think you fell into the way-back machine set for '65."
1,"Proprietary, Paranoid, Corporate Greedy BS","I got a copy of Cubase4 with my purchase of an Alesis Multi-track Recorder. Let me tell you something. The Licensing/Registration crap this company puts you through is worse than torture! I'd rather be water boarded by the CIA or shaved by angry Afghan tribal women than have to go through this kind of grief. This company needs a reality check. They obviously take their product way to seriously. Believe me, if you're not a professional studio engineer, you can get more than you need you need from freeware; if you are a professional studio engineer, there are plenty of other better supported, more user-friendly products on the market. So, bottom line: Unless you're the type of person who gets great pleasure in banging your head against a brick wall until your ears bleed, stay away from Cubase4."
3,Interesting Take on Animals,You have to sift through this book but if you read it carefully it's quite good. I can't say I understand why the animals are linked with Christian iconography (the author's interest in all of his books is how Chinese philosphy and symbols are harbingers of Christianity). If you ignore that part of the text this is a top-rate read for symbolism.
4,good,"theres not much choices out there when it comes to two room monitors, but this one works just fine! the lowest volume setting is very loud though but it does the job!"
2,good item terrible service,"The item was good the service was terrible. It was promised by Chrismas, but arrived 4 days late after my son arrived home and I had to ship it to him at my own expense. Many emails to the company yielded no compensation. I will never deal with this company or Amazon again"
2,"Cute, but not worth $20","Our future son's nursery is sage green, so I debated between getting this toile Boppy cover or the balboa cover as the new ""soft"" cover to add to our collection (we have millions of cotton Boppy covers and LOVE THEM!) However, when it arrived today, I was greatly disappointed at how only the top side is the soft material and the bottom is the regular cotton. I knew it was reversible- but the picture makes it look like the cotton-print side in on the INSIDE (and can be reversed if wanted), not on the bottom as it really is."
5,Good sturdy body...just wish the wheels werent plastic,We bought this wagon for my 2 children ages 10 months and 2 years. It has been a good wagon for us. The body has held up wonderfully and my kids love the little compartment under the seat and the drink holders. But the wheels are made of plastic which we didnt really notice when we purchased it. It doesnt go very well in the grass or in rocks. We recently moved from the village that had sidewalks to the country where there are none and we wished now that we would have purchased a wagon that has real rubber wheels.
3,Difficult Door,"We liked this wagon for its features (door, 2 seats, cupholders, storage area). However, the door is difficult to close and does not stay latched while in use. I called Step 2 about this problem and they sent us a new door, which still has the same problem. I would not recommend this wagon based on the poor door design."
2,Repetitive Redundancy,"I love Tom Lehrer's work, BUT... When you buy this boxed set, don't expect each of the CDs to have unique songs. The same songs appear on all three CDs. They may have been recorded at different times, but I had hoped to purchase a set of CDs with unique songs on them. Too much redundancy!"
5,"Great, stupendous, amazing!",This is simply the best airline book I have ever come across. It has just about everything you're looking for. My only complaint is that it's from 1997 -- it should be updated ever year.
5,I Love This Book!,"WOW! I got this book for my kids, and they had to wrestle it away from me to get a peek! It is fun, clearly written and beautifully illustrated. It's a wonderful introduction to herbs for both kids and adults. Lots of recipes for tinctures, syrups, poultices, powders and more; along with lore and some really fun stories about the individual plants. I only wish we were a musical family so we could enjoy the songs!"
4,from the back,"The dragonmen have taken Solace. Its beautiful tree houses lie black and battered amid the stumps of great vallenwood trees. Kapak Draconians, armed with poisoned weapons, enforce a crutal martial law on the survivors.And Solace is only one outpost: the dragonarmies control the plains. Only the elven kingdom of Qualinesti stands unconquered. The rest of the plainsmen suffer the most: a long slave caravan hauls hundreds of them to the fortress prison of Pax Tharkas.""Dragons of Flame"" is the second in TSR's new series of DRAGONLANCE adventures for use with the ADVANCED DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game system. Your players will adventure in the world of Krynn and visit strange places such as Qualinost or the Sla-Mori, encountering bizarre draconians and disgusting Aghar. They can play the module as a set of seperate adventures or as a great quest that spans the entire DRAGONLANCE story."
3,Beware!!! of calibration problems when shipping through UPS,Beware of calibration problems when shipping through UPS. I recieved mine with the calibration off by 50 pounds. Lucky for me the Distributor is 1 hour from my home by car. I took it to them and was fixed to perfection. But for those who do not live in Northern California beware of potential calibration change during shipment. And the hassle you may have with all the shipping back and forth to fix it! Otherwise GREAT scale GREAT VALUE!!
5,just what i needed,"works fine and shipping was pretty fast, great scale if your looking for a heavy duty scale"
5,Best of Its Kind,"As a criminal justice professor and a reserve peace officer, I deal with crime prevention topics on an almost daily basis. In the arena of personal protection against violent victimization, I have found no book that I can recommend more highly. Mr. Hardy presents critical crime prevention concepts in a clear and concise format. His ""Ten Tips"" provide an organizational structure that is easy to remember and easy to implement.If you are looking for the top ten ways to kill an attacker empty handed, then this book is not for you. It is also not for those desiring to hone their combat handgun skills. Mr. Hardy focuses almost exclusively on the most formidable weapon of all: The prepared mind."
3,Made my hair really dry,This made my extenions really dry.I think there is a lot af alcahol in there.Biosilk is so much better.
1,Not recomended,"I tried it on a Nikon P500, the charge lasts half the time of original one and become too hot. I recomendMaximal Power DB NIK EN-EL5 Replacement Battery for Nikon Digital Camera/Camcorder (Silver)as I tried and sill working as Nikon original."
1,Belkin Blew It,"We took ours back. This is the first Belkin product that we have had a problem with. Under normal, non-stressful operation, this device fell apart and almost destroyed my wife's iphone on the 2nd day she had it. She was able to catch the phone on it's way to the floor.The AT&T; store from which we purchased this case said they had several of these returned already.I believe that Belkin will either a)take it off the market altogether or b) introduce a ""new and improved"" version soon. They certainly won't keep selling this beautiful but oh so poorly built device."
1,Do not waste your time...,"I purchased this guide, as well as an environmental science textbook to help me pass this Dantes test... Wow am I glad I bought the textbook! As one of the earlier reviewers noted, the Rudman book is nothing more than a series of tests! Furthermore, less than 5% of the questions in the Rudman book ever showed up on the actual test. If I had to do it all over again, I would NOT waste my money purchasing this Rudman guide! Spend your money on a good (up to date) textbook and your money will be better spent!In addition, the Rudman guide did not contain entire sections of the test, and was severely lacking regarding issues being addressed TODAY. I honestly wish I had not spent so much time reading through the Rudman tests, as they were nothing more than a waste of time.Oh, and this review isn't just sour grapes... I passed with a 67 (you only need a 46), but it was certainly not due to this guide! :("
3,don't look like copper,Bought this wire to run 4 12 in subwoofers but when i cut the wire it was silver on the inside so i just bought different wire 12 gauge monster wire and just doubled it. but it is 10 gauge.
3,Color info missing,"When added to cart, color choice does not show. This is rather alarming as am about to travel and haven't the time to deal with errors, so will order from elsewhere."
5,a classic,"My children worked with this book 30 years and more ago--we still have the paper constructions they made out of it. It was a pleasure to find a used copy with the constructions still un-cut-out and ready to make--my grandson noticed that he'd have to make his for a new latitude, different from what his father had used. Great learning resource for anyone over about 6 with some curiosity and dexterity."
4,Despierta tu inteligencia financiera,"Excelente libro para despertar la inteligencia financiera.Abre tu mente a nuevas experiencias y oportunidades.Si quieres buscar la independencia financiera, este es el libro indicado.Los consejos aplican para USA, y no tanto para Latinoamerica (Ecuador especificamente)"
4,"Padre Pobre,Padre Rico","Es tremendo libro, te orienta y te ayuda a no depender de tu trabajo y tus estudios(Padre Pobre), si no de tu propio potencial.( Padre Rico )"
4,helps for carpal; a little flaky,"these definitely help for carpal. my problem--mouse clicking hurts the heck out of my wrist area.of course, these give you ""carpal"" type pain in your elbow area although not too bad.the main problem with these mice is they deteriorate typically after a year of use. things that happen:--the cursor will suddenly shift to the far left of the screen.--the mouse won't select correctly.--clicking on something doesn't click--it either just doesn't work or it will do something else.that said, these mice have been a HUGE help. you just have to replace them much more frequently than a regular mouse."
4,Ergo Mouse,"Product does what it claims, it takes a bit getting used to as it combines the motions of a mouse, a joystick controller, and a 3M Ergonomic Mousetrack ball. Once mastered & once the perfect locations is found, it works well. I am still in the thinking about it a bit phase as the movements are not yet natural but I think I will get there.I definitely feel the difference in my wrist & shoulder - which was the goal!"
4,Relieves pain but doesn't point well,"This mouse has definitely eliminated all of my wrist pain, forearm soreness and forearm muscle spasms. The only thing I dont like is, because of the grip style, it makes it difficult to pinpoint the mouse. I do a lot of business process flows and other diagramming on Visio and it is often difficult to accomplish a simple task like extending an arrow to an exact location. Overall I'm happy with it and will recommend it."
5,"hard to beat this mouse, corded and lasts for years","I still use a regular mouse at work, but at home i use this one. It really varies the motion and using the thumb as the primary button pressure is great once you get used to it. The scroll bar on the trigger isn't as ergonomic or easy to use, but it is there if you need it. I generally use page up/down anyway."
5,Great Product,"My wrist started hurting. Due to over usage my Dr said. So I did some research and decide on this mouse it really helped, no more pain."
2,so so,"It is ok for using a few hours, but using more than a few hours gives me some pain around my thumb.."
5,NO MORE PAIN,"Let's keep this simple. After weeks of discomfort, the PAIN IS GONE.The mouse is super EASY to use and not heavy.It is not cordless but I can live with that as long as my hands are PAIN-FREE"
3,"provides modest relief over standard, but there are better alternatives","This mouse provided some relief over a regular mouse. I think angling the hand in a more ""pistol-grip"" manner is more natural. However, after using it for awhile, I still developed strain because of the need to move the mouse around.For me, having a stationary input device is the best. I have the Logitech TrackMan Wheel and I am loving it. It takes only a day to get used to. It is very fast and easy to use. I would recommend a trackball over this 3M mouse."
2,Key feature doesn't work on Macs,"I get pains in my hands and knuckles when using a standard mouse and this is basically perfect for alleviating those pains. BUT - the scroll feature doesnt work with my Mac. Its maddening - an absolutely vital feature totally useless on my Mac. A great mouse if you have a PC, but if you are on Mac, steer clear."
2,"Good for wrists, bad for thumbs","This mouse certainly reduced my wrist pain. However, even with the small version, it ended up hurting my thumb."
2,If it fits just right,"My hand was too big even for the LARGE version, which made my thumb rest in a very awkward position. While my forearm felt more relaxed using the mouse, my hand itself actually started hurting.Plus the drivers are old NT4.0 version drivers. They work with XP, but just barely. No support from the manufacturer."
4,I stand behind it!,"It is absolutely better for you than a traditional mouse! It may take a small period of adjusting for some, but many will take to it right away. Some reviews say it can stress the user's upper arm/shoulder, so be sure to adjust your seating position and keep your elbow in close to your body while using it for long periods. The 3 buttons work on the Mac, but only as a left, middle, and right click -- the programability and scrolling features don't work on Mac platforms. This is the ONLY reason why I didn't give it that fifth star! It's light, it's smooth, and it's very ergo."
3,Just started using it,"I have just started using this mouse, so I cannot comment on how effective it is at reducing pain. However, I can comment on which ""size"" is best: small/medium, or large. My hand is approximately 3"" across the palm (not including thumb), and I originally bought the small/medium version (3M recommends small/medium if your palm width is 3.5"" inches or smaller). I must say that I found the small/medium one a bit too small for my liking. However, the ""large"" one does feel a bit too large as well. I think if your palm is 3"", then you can probably go with either one and get used to it. I ended up going with the large one."
3,A Flaw Away From Perfection,"Due to using the computer at work & at home, I developed a horrible case of wrist and finger pain. It got so bad, I literally could not use my old mouse. After reading reviews on Amazon, I dedided on the 3M mouse even though most people said it was cheaply made.Within a few days of using the mouse, my wrist & hand pain disappeared. Now one month later the mouse took a two foot fall from my keyboard tray to the floor and it snapped where the handle meets the base. I plan on using some superglue so I can get back to work. I may even order a 2nd mouse as a back up. Even though it's cheap, it works wonders to keep the wrist pain away.If 3M would strengthen the plastic joint where the handle meets the base, they could create the perfect ergonomic mouse."
4,Give it time.,"I absolutely hated this mouse when I first installed it. It took about a day to get used to it. Also, I had to recalibrate the mouse rotation to get it working well. Now that I have it adjusted to my liking, I use it every day and no longer experience hand or wrist fatigue. I still keep a regular optical usb mouse attached to the pc for editing photos and other apps requiring precision mousing."
5,Awesome!!,"Cleared up my carpal tunnel nicely. My shoulder was a little sore the first month I used it but that's not any problem now, I guess I just needed to build up different parts of my arm.I do game (not hardcore or anything)and I found this mouse works well enough. I won't buy any other kind of mouse after this. I'd say if anyone has a problem with their normal mouse to give it a try."
3,Too sensitive,I bought this because of the ergonomic factor but I am having an awful time dealing with the sensitivity of the mouse. It's hard to click on things and the left/right click on one button is hard to use. Hope I can get used to it soon.
5,"Finally, the doggone pain is gone!","I was really nervous spending this much money on something that I had no idea would work for me, despite the many other good reviews but I splurged on one. I was having so much pain, not in my wrist but in my actual mouse hand and I work full-time on my computer so I had to change something. I was constantly rubbing all sorts of pain killers on my hand which hardly worked at all so I got this mouse. Bam! This mouse works fantastic! I cannot believe how fast the pain is gone. Yes, it takes a little getting used to (like mother in law visiting) but it is completely worth it. I have never looked back and ALL of my wrist pain dissolved like a politician's promises. Sweet!"
1,"Other Voices, Other Rooms","In my opinion, I swear I don't know how this book ever got published! For me, it was a maze of a menagerie. Every character seemed like they should have be institutionalized. In this early work of Capote I feel he spends far too much time on description than he does on story. I wouldn't want to be in the same ""Room"" listening to ""Voices"" of any of these lunatics!"
2,Stagnates,"A rather claustrophobic book which is regretful because the boy, Joel and the girl, Idabel are certainly well painted characters. The story towards the end seems to go nowhere and becomes somewhat absurd with the midgets and the carnival.Capote takes us to this rural southern remote area and leaves us with no place to go. He also seems to have a dwarf fetish.Joel would be Capote as a boy and Randolph an elder drunken, decrepit with very little to offer. The house where Joel lives stagnates, and the story does the same."
4,really really good,"i had the wonderful opportunity of attending EFY last summer during the theme ""Remember The Promise"". it was such a good theme for me to start off my first year of EFY. the book had a lot of great talks in it. many of them were funny and helpful. i recommend buying this book for any teenager.p.s.-its even better to actually be at EFY when the speakers give the talk!i recommmend going to EFY to everyone!!"
2,THERE'S ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT,"GOOD NEWS: Product is made in USA, and the material, workmanship, and fit are satisfactory. BAD NEWS: 1) The cotton sole is a half sole, although the illustration on the package clearly indicates a full sole. 2) The pale cotton color does not match the nylon color, so the toe contrasts very noticeably with the rest of the stocking. 3) These are 2 pair packages; one of 6 that I ordered contained 1-1/2 pair."
2,Provoking But Not Complete,"This was an interesting read. The author makes several valid points about the kind of person that enjoys professional wrestling, but it seems that he lumps all fans into one basket. Although I detest the death of territory wrestling and the glass ceiling that exists today, I do not believe that all fans are ""alienated, can't get girls, and are into the homo-erotic"" aspects of wrestling. The biggest complaint with the book is two-fold...he ignores that a lot of us watch because a.) it's a temporary escape from reality, and b.) it's a soap opera for males (and females). Not once is this mentioned....mostly because he spent his research time on backyard wrestlers and independent hardcore wrestlers.....which a lot of us hate."
1,"Snide, pretentious, garbage","This reads like a really bad student dissertation, where the writer feels the need to use long unnecessary quotes from scholars to show his intellectual credentials.Though seemingly well read the author only espouses a highschool level pop psychology to explain the phenomenon of wrestling. He is disrespectful to the people who were kind enough to speak to him, and carries his feeling of superiority through out the book.This is a really interesting sub culture of people that deserves a well researched, and well thought investigation this is not even close."
2,Never got this product,"I have been buying things online for years and have never had so much trouble. I was sent the wrong part months ago and emailed the seller. Some how most of my emails got sent to the spam folder. I have tried calling 3 times a day for weeks and nothing. The only reason I'm giving 2 stars is because i got my money back, but it would be nice to have the part i ordered 3 months ago."
3,The Minimalist Cooks Dinner,"The cover was a little more worn then I would have liked, and not glossy like the library book I had (was hoping it would be glossy, but it could just be a different release), but overall good condition. I am glad to have this cookbook, it has lots of yummy recipes."
3,Are the stress marks included or omitted?,I want a verb reference with stress marks (501 Italian Verbs by Barron's doesn't have them.) Does this one have them?
4,"The books live up, the packaging needs help","I bought these for my daughter, they were the first real book I'd ever read and I wanted her to have a nice hardcover set. Well, the set is nice, the stories are classic (... that horrible film) but the ""box"" this box set comes in is wimpy and hardly collectable Mine came smashed, looks like ... Don't order this perticular set if you want astetics."
1,Bouncer,i had to return the bouncer. It is too noisy and bulky for my baby. My baby was not happy at all with it. Very dissatified.
3,It's ok,I don't think this bouncer is the safest on the market. I wish it held my son more securly there are no sides what so ever on it and the straps are positioned so it doesn't hold him in secure. He likes the seat - although I think he just cares about the vibration - so another seat would be fine for him too! I would purchase a different seat with my next child.
1,Disappointing,"This has been a hazard to my daughter, now 5 months. She kicks her feet, as all babies do, and constantly her heels hit the hard plastic part in the front that has the vibration switch on it. I have to keep a towel or blanket over it. Also, the top of her legs hit the plastic swinging toys, which are also very hard, and she got scrapes on her legs. My husband had to unscrew the thing and take the swinging toys off. Finally, after a few weeks, the motor gets VERY loud, louder than the music that is played. Not what I expected from Fisher Price."
2,Colors are attractive but bouncer is cheeply made,"Bought it for my nephew at my house. He loved his OW swing so I figured this would be wonderful for him. I like the colors and it seemed to have the best toy bar. But the thing seemed to be made cheeply and was bulky. The ""safty"" straps are worthless since they attach behind baby. Like the pictures of one poster show. Baby can fall out of it easily while still being attached.I ended up taking it back to get a Graco Travle Light. I love that thing. It's compact so I can put it under a bed when he's not here and I could take it us when we left the house. It's easy to set up. The toy bar just clips on (but other bouncers seem to clip on in a similar way) but if baby pulls on it... It's just soft foam and won't hurt baby. The Graco safty straps come on the side of baby to sucure them. I've gotten to the point where I can't go wrong with Graco."
5,Lifesaver!,"I am nursing my son and for the first few weeks it seemed that he was always latched on...not that I minded...but if I put him in his crib when he feel asleep after a few minutes he would wake up crying again. I had gotten this seat as a babyshower gift off of my registry and it sat in the closet for the first 2 weeks. One day I really needed to get the house cleaned and I did not want to leave my son crying in his crib. I took the bouncer out of the box, assembled it and put him in it. He loved ti right away. Now I put him in it several times a day and he falls alseep in it often. He really likes the baby mode where he can make the music and bubbles go by kicking his feet. :)"
1,"Unsafe, my baby fell over the edge","I recieved this bouncer as a shower gift. At first I was very excited to use this product until I found my three month old son leaning over the edge head down. He was completly buckled in, I was horrified! It now sits unused in the corner, what a waste. Please if you buy this product DO NOT turn your back, sit next to the bouncer while your child is in it and keep your hands free to catch your baby. I would not waste your money on a bouncer!!!!!"
2,Toy bar out of reach,"The movement and bubbles in the toy bar keep my baby entertained for a bit, and the gentle vibration helps on a constipated day(!!). But sadly the dangling toys are out of reach (even for my tall 4-month old), and are more frustrating for him than entertaining. The poor guy has trained himself to bat at the toys with his feet, and even grip on with his toes. But at the end of it the guy is so wired that I prefer not to have him do that. Would have been 5 stars if the toy bar had been closer to the baby."
2,Doesn't last long,"I got this for my daughter shortly after she was born. The problem that we ran into is that at about 5 months old she was getting ready to sit up and would start to pull herself up on the toy bar and lean over. A couple of times seeing her dangling by the seat belt with her head inches from the floor, and I got rid of this quick! Never Never leave a baby alone in this."
3,This needs a 5-point harness,"I registered for this for my daughter because my son was so easily soothed by the Ocean Wonders Crib Aquarium as an infant. It soothes my daughter too, but I am shocked that bouncy seats don't have 5-point harnesses as do all other baby products (swings, high chairs, car seats, strollers, etc.). Today my five-week-old daughter fell sideways and was hanging out of it. Luckily the 3-point harness kept her from falling to the ground. I would recommend this product if the manufacturer would make next year's model with a 5-point harness."
4,Great bouncer,"My daughter really enjoys this bouncer. She loves the music and likes watching the bubbles and lights. While she may not be able to reach the toys attached, she does enjoy kicking them. I'm glad that I purchased this bouncer, it has been a lifesaver. I'm able to put her in it in the middle of the kitchen floor while I'm working and she's entertained, I can get some things done, keep an eye on her, and she can keep an eye on me."
2,OK until your baby starts to move at all,"My son liked the vibration when he was very little, but by the time he was old enough to kick the toys, he began falling over the sides. It doesn't recline enough and the harness is positioned too low on the body to keep a baby safe. For a while I used it when I was sitting next to him but by the time he was 3 months old I had to stop using it entirely."
2,My Baby fell out of it and was hanging upside down,"I think this is a great bouncer if you remove your child from it by the time they are 5 months old. I didnt plan on doing that as we used our other bouncer for a much longer time with our first daughter.With this bouncer my daughter was 5 or 6 months old and we looked down and she was hanging upside down at the side. The problem is that the straps that hold the baby in are anchored at the center and the baby can shift their weight and lean to one side. My other bouncer had a tight fitting velcro strap across the whole front which prevented her from leaning and falling off.Fisher price refunded my money once I told them about the problem. Im sure I""m not the only one that this has happened to. Be careful and watch your baby closely once they become a little more active."
2,It ok,"my active baby love lights n sounds this one is just not exciting enough for her, but its too loud for naptime so she just glares at it for 5 minutes then fussesi wish i had bought the kick n play"
3,Entertaining,The only thing I don't like about this bouncer is that it doesn't fold up or make it easy to travel with. Unless you want to take it apart. It is entertaining and fun for babies though and the battery life last a long time.
3,Be careful........,"Our baby girl liked sitting in this, BUT she easily ended up head down (hanging over the side). My friend also has a baby the same age as my daughter and he also ended up hanging upside-down over the edge. Our son had a different Fisher-Price bouncer 5 years ago and this never happened. The main difference that I notice is that the sides on this one are much more shallow (because of the 'aquarium' attachment). I did contact Fisher-Price about this issue and they were more than willing to issue a refund (they sent a shipping lable and I sent it back to them).Perhaps the latest styles are deeper (at least I hope so). Just be careful !!"
5,great product!!,"This is one of the best items that I purchased for my new baby. I couldn't be happier with it. He loves to sit in it, and it is the only way that I can get a shower everyday! I bought it when he was 11 weeks old, and he is now 17 weeks and still enjoys it. I only wish I had bought it sooner!"
4,GOOD BOUNCER,"WE RECEIVED THIS BOUNCER AS A GIFT BEFORE MY SON WAS BORN. I USED IT ALOT, MY SON LOVED THE BUBBLES AND THE LIGHTS. THE ONLY BAD THING IS THAT IF YOU ARE BUSY AND USE YOUR FOOT TO BOUNCE IT BE CAREFUL! I WOULD USE MY FOOT BOUNCE THE SEAT WHILE SCRAPBOOKING OR WHILE DOING ANYTHING LIKE GETTING READY. WELL THE METAL FRAME BROKE ON THE BOTTOM. I THOUGHT I HAD A DEFECTIVE BOUNCER SINCE I DIDN'T PUT ANY WEIGHT ON THE FRAME. WELL I BOUGHT THE SAME ONE AND ABOUT 2 MONTHS LATER THE FRAME BROKE IN THE SAME SPOT. SO DO BE CAREFUL IT CAN BE KINDA SCARY IF YOUR BABY IS IN IT WHEN IT BREAKS. BUT IT IS STILL AN AWESOME BOUNCER MAYBE I JUST DID SOMETHING WRONG."
3,"Not really a bouncer, but good chair","I bought this product to replace a worn out bouncer. The chair is quality made, doesn't feel cheap, and my little guy is quite comfortable in it. The vibrations are nice for him, not too strong. The swing out toy bar is wonderful and is the reason I chose this bouncer over the other bouncers.The only negative I have to say about this bouncer is that it doesn't bounce... And it takes the full weight of my adult hand to make it rock, and when I do rock it, its not the smooth fluid motion you get with most bouncers. It's kind of jerky, it's only as smooth as my hand motion can make it.It's a good chair. When he starts solids, I'll use it to feed him. It's a comfortable chair, I let him nap in it sometimes... But this product should not be considered a bouncer; it does not bounce."
4,pretty and useful,"we got this when we found out we were having another girl, and it is very pretty and very girly. we have used it ever since our daughter was 2 weeks old and it has worked perfectly. the 1 and only complaint i have is for the musical flower. the problem is that it hangs down low and in front of the baby's face. our daughter isn't old enough to pull the cord and the flwoer is a very hard plastic. i ended up cutting the flower off and have saved it for when she is older and i can reattach it. i would buy this as a gift for anyone having a little girl, it is vital!"
5,Best thing we have for baby,Seriously this is the best item we have for our son. Whenever he is fussy we put him in this and in seconds he is quiet and happy. We put him in this every night at dinner time and we actually get to enjoy our meal. When he turned 4 months old we used this to feed him his solids because he couldn't sit up yet. We got so much use out of this chair. If you buy anything for your baby I would say this should be it. I can't say enough good things about it! Worth every penny!
5,Love the bouncer!,"We have throughly loved the Ocean Wonders Bouncer. Nathan loves the movement of the fish in the water, the music, and the vibrating. I would highly recommend this product for anyone who has a small baby."
3,This bouncer is okay!,"I originally bought this toy when my son was just a few weeks old. At first he loved the soothing vibration and eventually became engaged with the kissing fish and bubbles. My son basically used this for 2 months and now that he is 3 months, refuses to even sit in this toy. Maybe it's just my baby and other babies find this bouncer interesting. My baby just is not into this seat at all anymore."
2,BORING,"This bouncer is ok. When my baby was younger and I couldn't get him to go to sleep I would put him in this bouncer with the vibration on & it would put him right to sleep. Now that he is 4 months old he wont sleep in it and wont stay in it very long. It is boring. There are no lights or upbeat songs. There is nothing going on with it, nothing happening, nothing exciting. I wish that there were more lights, along the sides, top, etc. and more activites."
3,Maybe good for a sleepy head,"Our baby never slept in bouncy seats, so we were disappointed that the ""entertainment"" portion of the seat was very mellow and sleepy. None of the music is upbeat for an awake baby that is looking for stimulation."
3,legs too wide,"I really like this bouncy seat. However, both grandmas insist that the legs are too wide and they are going to trip over it. Hence, I am only giving it three stars."
1,So Upset,I loved this bouncer when I sawl it.I liked all the colors and the fish overhead.My son loved it.It was all great until I had to replace the battery for the massager.Once we did that the bouncer rattled.I can't turn it on anymore and he loved it.I am so upset with this product.Do not waist your money.
3,"Why should you read ""The Trouble With Lemons""","The book ""The Trouble With Lemons"" by Daniel Hayes was a fairly good book. The thing I really liked about it was as you read along it was mysterious and exciting. It was also easy to read so you could understand what it was you were reading. I also liked that it dealt with a murder. It was fun to try and figure out who the killer really was and if he/she would strike again. The book left you wanting to read on and see what was bound to happen next. I would recommend this book to any one who enjoys funny and/or thrilling books."
3,The trouble with lemons is....,"The Trouble with Lemons was interesting in the beginning, with the murder and the boys finding the body in the quarry at night. It made it all very suspenseful and interesting. But after the body was found and they figured out who was killed, it started to get boring. They pretty much only talked about the boy's schoolwork and then how they would get in fights. Then finally at the end, they talked a little about the murder. It was sort of a stupid ending though. If you like murder and mystery (sort of!) then you will probably like it."
4,The Trouble With Lemons- An awesome read!,"It is difficult for me to tell you how much I loved this book! There was a number of reasons why this book turned out to be so good. First of all, it taught me a lot of lessons in different areas. The main character, Tyler, thought he had so many problems in his life, but it just so happens that he had everything to be happy about. I think this matter relates really well with teenagers that are growing up and searching for who they are.Also, this book kept me hooked so well! You might suspect this book is boring because it is just about some kid growing up, but of course it is mixed with a mystery which makes you want to keep reading. Hope you choose this book for your next read!!!!"
5,Liz In Va,"This is a great program that is easy to follow and effective. There are three parts, the first 15 minutes is powerwalking with hand weights (the use of weights is a great idea and the upper body moves are effective), the second part (15 minutes) gets more into cardio with several two minute low impact cardio walking circuits and each finishes up with a high impact modification. The last 10 minutes are yoga. This is perfect for someone who doesn't have alot of time as you can do one segment a day or all three and still get an effective work out."
2,Not to the point,"Not enough firm details, seems alot of theory of one man. The old history and dates are interesting. But it goes back and forth with lack of confidence from the author."
3,dry erase-flannel board combo,"The item is as described but the two boards appear to just be glued together with a glue gun. They are beginning to separate. It's an easy fix, thankfully, but I wish it was made better or at least glued together with a stronger adhesive."
5,Great hard drive.,"This hard drive is great if you have a HP computer with a slot in front of it. It works seamlesslly and there is no mess and no noise or nothing. It's great. It also looks cool with its nice metal shine. Plus, you can connect it to other computers with a USB 2.0 cable. The only downfalls are that you have to use an A/C adapter to plug it in to another PC and you only really need it if you have a slot in front of your computer. Otherwise, it's a must buy if you need it for big projects on HP computers, like video editing."
1,Lifeless and Dull,"This movie is as cold and devoid of life as the depths of space where it was set. A convoluted plot, bad acting, and poor special effects all collide to make this movie less than memorable. Matter as fact, as soon as you turn the DVD off, you'll be trying to forget that you just wasted an hour and a half of your life.Among other atrocities committed to film include blatant gender and racial stereotypes. African Americans in this movie are either muscle bound labor or drug crazy idiots. Women are either scared princesses or hookers.The special effects are just as poor as the rest of the film. The exteriors of the ship look like an extra credit project for an art student and the vampire `make up' is nothing more than Goth shop stick-on fangs and red contacts.Save yourself time and money and move on to another film."
2,"Yeah, it stinks. The story is worth another shot though.","This is a horrible movie, don't buy it. Rent if your a sci-fi curioso and can't resist, but otherwise there is no reason to see this movie. The Story though, could have been on to something, which is why I viewed in the first place.So you Producers out there: if your going to make a movie like this, give the 20thousand to charity instead and take the write-off. And spend some real money on the development of a Vampire Planet. You will engulf TWO markets in one, the headsucker wannabes and trekkies. Eh?"
1,PUT THE MOUSE DOWN AND BACK AWAY SLOWLY....,"This movie is so bad, it's not even entertaining in that cheesy B-movie way. It's so predictable, you don't even have to watch it to know how it's going to end. Really. You could've written this script yourself and it would have been better, even if you shot it using members of your family and a home video camera. If you've seen the cover, you've seen the good part.However, Dracula 2000 is completely and entirely different; it's not a series and THAT'S actually a good movie with some thinking going on. Go spend you hard-earned dollars on it instead."
3,Dracula in Space? That Idea Really Sucks...,"Well, I bought this movie for some unknown reason. I guess I didn't have enough cheese in my diet. Casper Van Dien (The king of B- Horror movies) is Capt. Van Helsing (sound familiar?) who is transporting cargo from the planet of Transylvania. Is this planet anywhere near Transexual? Maybe not, but Frank-N-Furter would have been more realistic than Coolio's stoner performance as 187. Ay,Ay,Ay! Resembling a low budget ""Jason X"" good ole Drac is biting people in space. I guess his reasoning is there is no sunshine in space. Well, there is some suspense and a few chills. The film isn't without some merit. If your in to Vampire flicks, add this one to your collection."
5,As important as it is profound,"I have no reservation in saying that this book was not only an engaging read, but also some of the most important lessons mankind should ever learn. Fouts takes us through it all - he fascinates us beyond comprehension with the accounts of his studies and conversations; he moves us as only the truth can with his descriptions of the bonds of friendship he has formed with his chimp family; he stirs our blood with outrage and disgust at the ""arbitrary and capricious"" cruelty inflicted upon these magnificent beasts; and he outlines some of the keenest insights to the mechanics and geneaology of human cognition ever laid to paper. Fouts' tale illustrates him as the epitomy of every title he might hold: scientist, teacher, father, companion, human. And I cannot help but beam with pride, respect and admiration for the great girl herself, Washoe. Required reading for all of us enrolled in this great course called ""life""."
5,Fascinating!,"I love this book! Roger Fouts brings the chimpanzee's in his life in to clear focus for us! This is a superb mix of entertainment and education. Dr. Fouts enlightens us about the plight of chimpanzees without leaving us to despair of their fates. Once you read this book you will understand why it is so imperative that we finally start treating these incredible individuals like the kindred creatures that they are. Roger Fouts has led a fascinating life and we are lucky to have this opportunity to share in it! Thanks Roger! Jean Swingle Greek, co author of Sacred Cows and Golden Geese and Specious Science"
4,RIP Roy...,"Although I do agree there should be a disclaimer on the album cover stating that these are indeed RE-RECORDED versions of the classic releases, the only reason an artist does this in the first place is because of royalties, period.I'm not positive, but chances are Roy was getting stiffed for contractual BS back in the day, and he wasn't getting the royalties for his songwriting from the original master tapes that he should have been. Whoever's fault that is, I haven't a clue. But the point is moot--this is a 1987 release that actually improves on most of his classics, and my only complaint is the background voices.They sound more whitebread than usual, like mom and pop showed up for vocals. That being said, the versions of ""Blue Angel"", ""Crying"", and especially the title track just slay me every time. Lots of bang for your buck, too--the original cardboard packaging for this disc was nice."
2,NOT his original recordings,"The ""What The Critics Say"" review above says it the best: Since these are not his original recordings -- but instead are versions rerecorded in 1985 -- there is some intangible quality that is missing.I hate it when artists do this. To be fair, Orbison still sounds pretty good. But I bought this album in a CD store, not knowing that it did not contain the original hits (nowhere is this fact stated on the CD cover), so I was pretty disappointed when I discovered what I REALLY bought.Then I had to go out and buy Rhino's compilation: ""For The Lonely."" This is the real thing. This is the one you want. Not this album."
5,A great buy,We just got this same bouncer but in the Winnie the Pooh pattern (couldn't find this one in the store) and I LOVE it. We borrowed a neighbors while we were out of town and had to get one of our own. It has enough support for my 3 week old and the vibrations help him when he is fussy with gas (must help work out some of the bubbles). If I could change anything about it I would just have the option for lights without the music simply for my preference. All in all this is awesome.
5,Great bouncer,"My little boy wasn't to thrilled with the bouncer at first and is still getting adjusted with the detachable lighted entertainment bar, but he just loves his bouncer now. The vibrating seat really helps him calm down too."
5,Baby & Mom Joy,I received this gift and love it so much. My infant is 3wks old and she loved it from day 1. We place her in the bouncer and she falls alseep. It is a much have. It also gives mom time to do some chores around the house.
5,Necessity,This product is a necessity. I did not want to put my child in an exersaucer or walker due to causing spinal problems. This seat is convenient. I used it to read to the baby. It is also convenient because you can take it anywhere in the house so that the baby is in your view. My son loves to play with the attachments. The vibrator is an excellent feature on this product as well.
1,ugly!,"maybe some babies like this, but mine does not, and neither do i. not only does it play really annoying tunes and look like a baby version of times square (hectic and overlit), but it is hideous. my husband and i want to hide it."
1,A training manual for insurance agents!,Run _don't walk_ away from people who want to sell you a VUL. There is a reason the WSJ and every one else in the insurance industry slammed this investment product: it is detrimental to anyone's ability to create wealth. In this case the old rule still applies- buy a level term policy and invest the rest of the money you would be saving in a mutual fund with better performance and flexibility than a VUL! I also recommend that you read The New Rules of Money.
4,can see again,I really like the product. It is amazing how large and clear you can make the print. the reason i got a new one (my old one was about 15 years old) is it was too scratched up to use. I got the new one and it had a scratch on it. Still usable. when i wanted to return it Amazon said not returnable but they would credit my account. Ride on Amazon.
2,Don't bother to order this,"I was very disappointed with the item for the price. Not what I was expecting, should have researched further. Don't bother to order, not worth the money!"
5,Defies Gravity!,"I choose the title ""Defies Gravity"" for my review because I literally could not put this book down! It would not stay down but kept ending up in my hands insisting I get to the next page, then the next, and so on! I stumbled upon this book on a book exchange shelf at a local coffee house. It is a great epic story of the Griffiths family and their move to America from Wales as immigrants in the late 19th century. Once you read this book you will need to find the next book in the series to continue with the brilliant story of the Griffiths family. I could write a longer review but you should spend your time reading the book, not the reviews!"
5,Enjoyable read,"Entertaining and interesting plot although it is, at times, a little far-fetched. I will buy more of this series in the future."
4,Great book,Had to write and say how much I enjoyed this book. Family sagas are a favorite of mine and this one did not disappoint. My only criticism would be that it had a pretty slow start and I almost stopped reading. Decided to give it a few more pages and am really glad I did. Hope to read more by this author.
4,Beautiful plant but...,"I'm rather ignorant about plants, I will admit... but I was a little disappointed when I received this plant only to realize that it's an outdoor plant. At least I assume that it is because it came with an ""Outdoor Bonsai Care"" pamphlet. It doesn't say anywhere in the description on here that it's an outdoor plant. It is a beautiful plant but I don't have an outdoor area to keep it in so I'm going to wind up giving it to a friend."
4,Good for the money,"Bought these to replace the ailing fronts on my '00 S10 4x2. Made a big difference, the truck brakes and corners much more steadily now. I do a lot of highway travel, and these ride firm but not harsh. Just the way I like it. Nothing difficult about installing these, but getting the old ones off was a pain in the can."
4,U581 Memoscanner,"I bought my scanner in Oct. 21, 2008. It came very quickly by the seller. And when using it at first, I had mixed results. Some times it would work fine and other times it would shut down after trying to connect to the Auto Link. Later I found out that you must press the enter button and release quickly, other wise it would think you wanted it to shut down, which it did. If you go pass the 30 day grace period, don't expect any support from the seller or the manufacture. They will not return your E-Mails. The unit performed as advertised and the up dating of software is probably a little more complicated than the average computer person can handle, but it can be accomplished.Thanks John"
1,Horrible read,"Being a vegan, I was excited to pick up the book. I haven't read a horrible book in a long time, and was disappointed to realize this was probably the worst book I have ever read. The character is not a vegan by the end of the book, which was probably the most disappointing aspect, but the characters were unrealistic and the plot was extremely boring and unoriginal. It was a quick read and you can read it in less than an hour, but I advise you not to waste your time."
3,Very Very Predictable,"Mara Valentine has her whole life figured out. She's well on her way to becoming the senior class valedictorian, she's been accepted to Yale and plans to spend her summer taking courses at Johns Hopkins University. Her neice Vivienne Valentine (otherwise known as V), is only one year younger than Mara and has nothing figured out. She couldn't care less about grades and extra-curricular activities. She just wants to party and have a good time.When Mara's parents agree to take V in for a little while, Mara is sure that it will be disastrous. And sure enough, the first thing V does upon arriving at the new school is make out with Mara's ex-boyfriend. V and Mara begin to loathe each other more than ever before.The story is formulaic, predictable and marred by unoriginal dialogue, but Mara and V's struggles are interesting enough to make this book a fun read."
5,"The Vallant ""Vegan, Virgin, Valentine""",I'm a 6th grade student and began reading all of Carolyn's books for a class project. I'm so glad I chose her. The book is very interesting...I read it in only a few days. The issues in this book are ones I'll be facing in a few years. I shared parts of the book with my mom and we talked about the issues Carolyn wrote about and that's cool. I'm recommending Carolyn's books to my friends and others my age. They are humorous and make me think.
1,sometimes being cheap isn't enough,"Especially if cheap is all you are.My list of gripes:1) The plastic case it came in falls open often, spilling bits everywhere.2) The blowmolded tray that is in the case, that the bits fit in, is weak as plastic wrap and the bits go sliding everywhere even when the case is closed.3) The metal is not hard enough and deforms with use. Don't apply too much torque!4) The torx security bit was made wrong and did not work.I don't enjoy looking for the bits in the desk drawer, and now I only use this for extreme emergencies because the bits don't hold up to much use.This item belongs in a dollar store, being sold for a dollar. I bought some tools like that in college, and this is the same poor quality."
1,Doesn't work,"I tried the tool and it is junk. The way the handle holds the blade, you can't control the angle and it is very difficult to use. The caps covering the screws both fell off and the handle feels hard and cheap. I tried a friend's furminator and it worked 10 times better."
2,Don't Care For*,"I don't really care for this item. It was just like a comb. I thought it would really removed excess hair, but, it doesn't."
2,Disapointed,I have a lot of cats and I didn't get nearly the amount of hair up out of the coat that they show on TV. Those dogs must not ave been gromed in a couple of years! Waste of money.
2,Didn't work well for me,"After reading some of the reviews, I thought this would be a great product. I had bought a similar cleaner at Wal-Mart for $30 so for $60 I had hoped this one would be much better. It wasn't. It leaked continuously. When I went from one room to another it left a trail of water. The floors were saturated when finished. The appliance is heavy, especially hard to push when full of water. The only positive thing I can say about it is that it did get my floors looking clean but so does a $5 mop!I can NOT recommend this product."
1,bad song by bad band,awful band. awful song. this band is pure pop not punk. if you want good punk then I suggest Offspring's Ignition.
3,Ok Vitamins,"I have 2 Labs. One of them loves the taste of these and the other spits them out and will only eat the PetTabs, but I do think these are quality vitamins."
5,A gentle series of encounters suitable for the very young,"Love Songs Of The Little Bear presents four new poems by Brown, illustrated with lovely gouache paintings by Jeffers. Simple interactions between a young bear and the seasons blends with a warm family setting in this gentle series of encounters suitable for the very young."
5,"An Insightful, Thoughtful and Excellently Written Book","A great resource for turbulent years, I found this book to be a great guide for those in one of life's many hardships. Waggoner relates the tough times that we all must face in an honest, realistic way, and yet points us towards the only solution in every trial. Excellent material, especially from such a young writer, she writes with a command that many veteran writers cannot seem to find. Simply an excellent work, I cannot wait to read this promising young author's next work!"
5,The Answers for the Questions Teen Face,"""This book is a great resource for any teen or young adult. Withcompassion and empathy, Brittany Waggoner reaches the heart of the reader, offering practical, scriptural advice for dealing with the tough challenges teens and young adults face today."""
4,An educated summation of Prog-rock,"This is a top-notch book on progressive rock music that any fan of the genre should read. In addition to providing a fair, credible defense of a style that has long been maligned or overlooked by the mainstream music press, Martin's analysis also probes into the theoretical as he attempts to craft a workable definition of the genre itself. Not everyone will agree with the narrow definition that he produces,(Pink Floyd, Frank Zappa, and Led Zeppelin, among other familiar names, are not considered progressive), nor will there be much consensus about the bands from the era which he deems most important. Nevertheless, this is a well-written and analytically consistent piece that merits the attention of all serious popular music fans, prog supporters and detractors alike."
1,Weak on scent,These little trees are weak on scent and do not have the lasting power to be worthy of purchase. This sometimes happens with their products from time to time and across different scents. I do not know why but sometimes they smell strong and sometimes weak. If they are strong they last awhile and if weak maybe a day or so. This whole set i purchased was weak. The scent smells like a mans cologne which is not bad and is up to your preference. I would not suggest any purchase of this until the company corrects the amount of scent on each. Considering that i have encountered this many times now with their product it cannot be accidental or a production problem. It must be intentional by design and with the intent to sell more product so i say dont buy little trees of any scent.
4,"Nice, but",This carry case is real nice. Does it's job well. The only thing is the magnets that close the case interfere with the outside display. I noticed this when I locked the key pad and run it by the magnet and the outer display would flash and then the keypad would be unlocked. Had to replace the phone the other day because the outer display went out. It would be a better case in my opinion if it was closed with velcro or some other method besides magnets.
1,waste of money,"i have had it for 3 years or so---rice is never right (no matter who cooks it)....tried to adjust the measurements--still not good enough.... too sticky, messed up and turns into a film on the bottom...expected better results.."
2,Disappointed,"I expected better from this rice cooker and warmer. Even on the first day, rice was somewhat burned. I wanted to return the item, but I used it once and I thought I would not be able to exchange or return it. That's why I keep it. Whenever I use it, I feel not good."
5,The best rice cooker I've owned!,"Wow - what a difference over those cheap aluminum cookers. This thing cooks delicious, fluffy rice every time. And all it takes to clean it is a dry paper towel. I couldn't justify the cost of those ""fuzzy logic"" cookers - and neither can you. Buy this one instead."
5,delicious sticky jasmati,"This is my first rice maker. I gave up trying to cook rice in a pot on the stove. I tried jasmati with the Zojirushi two times, skipping the rinsing beforehand and adding just the amount of water normally suggested. Rice came out harder than I like. So I decided to stop cutting corners. You need to rinse (soak) the rice about half hour, and THEN put it in the Zojirushi. And be sure to add more than the water suggested. Ex. One half cup of rice, plus one cup of water AFTER the soaking...and then add another quarter cup of water. Plug it in, and when the yellow warm-steamer light comes on, let it steam a half hour. Then fluff it as directed, close and let stay warm for as long as you wish. You get delicious sticky rice, so good you wish you had made MORE."
1,Messy and poor design,"Bought this as a replacement for a traditional Hitachi rice cooker. It is a mess to use as water bubbles out all over this thing. It is a mess to clean up as it has a number of small parts which are easily misplaced, and difficult to clean when they are covered with baked rice. I've already broken the lid-catch twice, replacing it once for $3, pretty good price, but no more. I am looking for another brand."
4,Good standard rice cooker,"I bought this as a gift for my mom, and it is a quality rice cooker. Not too fancy, durable and easy to use. The only downside is how the pot fits into the maker; there is a little ridge where rice cooker steam get collect and ""gunk"" up if you are not careful."
1,Poor Reliability,"I bought this rice cooker this month based on its 5-star rating.1) I understood that it had no on/off switch and you must plug and unplug to start cooking and turn off the power.2) It also took up more counter space because it was low and fat.3) It had no accessory as a steamer. But worst of all,4) It dropped power in the middle of cooking after only two weeks. It stayed dead even after cooling off or plug/unplug.Now I need to take it to San Francisco to get it repaired."
5,Great little trimmer,"I only really use it as a ""down there"" groomer and it works great. However, at the shortest guard level, I've nipped myself a couple times but not majorly. On closer inspection after being nipped, the trimmer's teeth are pointed... so I wouldn't recommend using it without the guard at all or on the shortest level near skin that might be a little loose.All in all, I've used it for a couple years on the shower and it's still going strong. A wise purchase."
3,Good Size/Lid Needs Improving,"The large size is great for serving a crowd. I use it mostly for keeping food warm for buffet serving at parties. I do have a complaint with the lid. The knob on the lid gets hot, so be sure to have a pot holder handy. When I replace this, I'm looking for one with a better lid with a heat resistant knob."
2,Disappointed,"I bought this to help cooking my dogs food. Looked fine, but cooks way too hot, dont look to cook anything small in here and walk away!! I was cooking about 6-8 cups of food and it burned overnight."
5,You can get this for $59.99 @ costco.com,"This rice cooker is great, but Amazon overcharges you. You can get it for $30 less at Costco.com!"
3,Fair to Good Rice Cooker,"I've had this rice cooker for about three months now. I wouldn't say that it is a great rice cooker, only slightly better than average. Does a better job with long grain than short grain."
5,Really Pleasantly SURPRISED!,"Pleasantly surprised by this book, how well the TRUE story is told, depth of detail, passion imparted by author to the story of the capture of his ancestor by Apache in 1870 Texas. Much 1870 era history of the area around Llano, Fredricksburg, Ft. McKavett, etc. I learned a lot from this little book, and will give the author my compliments on a well written, interesting story, well worded and told. Couldn't put it down! If you like John Graves ""Goodbye to a River"", you will love this book!"
4,"Good Travel Food Book ""Not Cook Book""","Very concise book on Japanese food and great descriptive traditions and cultural significance. For those look to find recipes or how-to-cook japanese, then its not what its meant to be. Its for travellers to Japan willing to try local food and try different things. It has very good nation-wide representation from staple foods, alcohol, history and cultural depth. I would recommend it those who love Japanese food and travels to parts of country other than Tokyo."
4,A great momy and my costume,"I used it to complement my kid's superman costume and take him treak or treating. We made an awesome pair. It fits very nice, makes your figure look very nice. The boot tops are a good idea, but the don't realy cover the shoe like in the picture."
3,SUPER FUN,I RATE THIS ITS OKAY BECUZ IT IS A LITTLE SNUG AND TOO HOT ON BUT I LIKE BEING SUPER GIRL EVEN IF I DON'T HAVE THE RIGHT HAIR LOOK FOR IT AND NOT BLONDE WHICH I USED TO BE. I DON'T LIKE THAT IT IS TOO SHORT AND MAYBE SHOULD OF GOT THE OTHER SUPER GIRL OUTFIT LIKE FROM THE MOVIE BUT I AM FINE. I RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE WHO LIKE SUPER HERO MOVIES AND SUPER GIRL
2,Not impressed,"I purchased this item because of the good reviews, but I have not had good results with it. I have used it on my own hair (quite damaged), as well as both of my daughters' hair (one's is somewhat damaged due to coloring, the other's is quite healthy). With all three of us, there was no discernable difference--although by not being able to use conditioner on the treatment-day after shampoo, all of our hair seemed dryer.Also, this product smells very much like beer or vinegar when you first apply it. The smell does dissipate, however, after several minutes. I also was having trouble applying it with the squirt bottle that came with it, so I started using a mini spray bottle, which did help. All in all, I expected better results, by far."
5,Grrrrrrrreat!,"I'm so excited to find this on Amazon.com. I used this years ago, and found that it repaired my hair from a really bad perm. It gives hair outrageous body. It's like a new head of hair! Great stuff -- just fabolous!"
5,LOREAL HAIR FIXER,"THIS IS A GREAT PRODUCT.I HAVE ORDERED IT THREE TIMES NOW AND I LOVE IT.MY HAIR WAS BEYOND FRIED.I FOLLOWED THE SUGGESTION OF ANOTHER REVIEWER AND I USE A CLARIFYING SHAMPOO THE DAY THAT I USE THIS.MY HAIR IS HIGLIGHTED AND PREMED.THIS IS AN INURAL CONDITIONER,WHICH MEANS IT GOSE INTO THE HAIR ,INSTED OF A TOPICAL,LIKE MOST CONDITIONERS.WHEN I USE THIS CONDITIONER I DO NOTHING ELSE TO MY HAIR IT GETS SO MUCH BODY AND SHINE,I REALLY LOVE IT.I USED IT FOR THE FIRST TIME BEFORE A COLOR AND THE DAMAGE WAS MINIMAL.LIKE ANY CONDITIONER WHEN YOU DON'T USE IT YOU CAN TELL THE DIFFERANCE,BUT I STILL LOVE IT ,IT'S LIKE NOTHING ELSE I'VE EVER USED!!!!"
4,Excellent Read,"I loved this novel! Dan Simmons took an ages-old story and combined it with more modern history and threw in some hemotology labwork and came up with a great book. I love the way he wove the legend of blood-sucking vampires into a plausible tale of a slightly different kind of human, who just happens to need blood to exist..."
1,"So, so disappointing.....","After reading 3/4 of the way through this book, I was impressed by the magnitude of research Dan Simmons had to do in the field of hematology, Romanian politics, and historical data on Vlad Tepes. However, towards the 3/4 mark, I felt that the characters were not behaving ""in"" character nor like real people. I found myself suffering to get through the final pages due to a decent plot that turned into an ""Indiana Jones"" movie. In a nutshell: I was very disappointed in this book."
4,"The Christmas Doll, By Elvira Woodruff","This book I really liked. I had this book for a very long time, but never really got to read it. I started it one day and I couldn't stop. I finished it within two days. Glory and Lucy Wollcot are sisters living in the workhouse (The home for little orphan girls)in London Town.Their meal are scarce their nights are dark and cold and they hear many terrible storys of little girls who escape then get caught. To brighten up their spirits, Lucy ""creates"" storys of their family that she barley rembers- and a doll named Morning Glory that they are sure they will find again some day. When a deadly fever comes accross the workhouse, the girls escape without getting caught to the terrible streets of London. When the sisters find an old, discarded doll, Glory is positive that it is Morning Glory. Morning Glory is different from other dolls... And she works her magic on every body!"
4,not a bad product,"I ordered a set of three balls recently and was disappointed with the lack of flex and the surface became sweaty.This ball has a nylon cover, it is a little bigger and more comfortable.Also the pliability when I squeeze feels pretty good.I ordered some hand therapy putty to see if it will be more satisfying."
5,The perfect stress ball,"I've had this for a few weeks now and have nothing negative to say about it. It's fun to squeeze, it's durable, but it's also very bouncy. I've gotten into the habit of tossing it into the air and catching it, but if I miss, it will bounce and roll under the bed or something, actually stressing me out further, but that's my fault. Assuming it's kept in your hands, it will serve its purpose nicely."
3,I THOUGHT IT WOULD HOLD THE SHAPE WHEN SQUEEZED...,IT'S A GREAT SQUEEZE BUT ULTIMATELY I WANTED SOMETHING THAT HELD THE SHAPE WHEN SQUEEZED. IT FEELS JUICY AND GOOEY NOT STICKY GOOEY BUT SLIPPER GOOEY LOL
5,great,gives me something to do when im reading or doing my homework. feels real good and is good quality o
4,Gel squeezies,"Excellent product, but could be a bit softer for my intended use. It would have been nice to get an assortment of colors, rather than all 1 color."
1,A Case Study in Turning a Term Paper Into a Book,"I was hoping for a model for conducting a case study. This is definitely not it. This is an academic discussion of sociology-based case studies.It may be just what some were looking for, but it is not the manual on how to do a case study."
4,Works,"I bought this product for myself out of curiosity and it works great. However, a few drawbacks to mention. The backlight is blinding in the dark, not soft at all. At any agle except dead on, the numbers are hard to see on the display. Also, the power socket is located on the bottom and is very small, making it difficult to connect. Projection is great, sharp and big."
5,Real World Instructions for Maya Users,"I had long wanted to begin the process of learning Maya, but was intimidated every time I opened the damned program. John Park's book allowed me to grow past that fear and build a strong foundation in understanding the program. His instructions are easy to follow and his exercises (included on an accompanying CD) provide real world experiences for learning Maya's basics. Additionally, it is a well-rounded instruction manual that teaches about many aspects of the program (instead of a few particulars). Please buy this book, so Mr. Park is encouraged to release additional manuals!"
4,It is very interesting!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! : ),I really enjoyed reading this book. It was so exciting but also used many interesting facts about crows and their lives. This was a very emotional story with sad happy and funny parts. This book reflects on Jean Craighead Georges life. I would definitley give THE CRY OF THE CROW a high rating!
2,Disappointed,"I paid $97.00 for this newly released book. Pages 23-54 are missing and I have little time to deal with a complaint and return process. In skimming the book, it gives a basic intro, overview of computer hardware/software, data management; applications, project management, and future directions. This information is available in less expensive textbooks."
5,Great Decaf Tea,"Once I tried this decaf tea, it is all I drink. I even take tea bags with me when I travel. Too bad it is hard to find in the local supermarkets but I order it on Amazon and it works out."
2,Needs A Rewrite,"While I'm sure this is a classic book, it's very difficult to read. It's a fairly deep subject and that combined with the poor writing makes it really tough to get through. I wish I had known that before I bought it.I'm really surprised given all the glowing reviews.Just be warned. Good content but will take some serious effort to get through."
2,Cheap quality,I just received the product and i will never buy this product anymore. Its made in China and the printed quality is horrible. The shuttlecocks appear to be flimsy.
4,Am I the only one with sound problems?,"I've received three copies of this disc from Amazon, and all three have dropouts throughout the DTS soundtrack. It happens less noticibly on the DD soundtrack (it only occurs on the rear channels, so I haven't checked the PCM soundtrack), but it occurs there as well. The three discs in question were played on two different players with the dropouts occurring in exactly the same spots.Am I the only person who has seen/heard this occuring?"
4,magic,Jim Butcher's Dresden Files series are well done and enjoyable reading. Make sure you read them in order though. Harry Dresden continues to develop as the series continues.
1,BEWARE... DEFECTIVE PART,PURCHASED THIS CAP... AND REPLACED IT WITH MY OLD ONE WITH IN ONE DAY MY CAR WAS OVERHEATING DID NOT UNDERSTAND WHY... WHEN I TOOK IT TO THE AUTO SHOP THEY LET ME KNOW THE RADIATOR CAP WAS DEFECTIVE AND HAD TO WALK INTO A AUTOZONE AND PURCHASE A NEW ONE... :(
3,good item but bought org instead,"i'm pretty sure this is a good product, still made in china, what's new, i don't think it worked well on my car, went to dealer and paid too much, but at least, i think this one was made in japan , still,stant is a good brand, would buy again in fact i bought 2 one in pep boys one online, same results... dealer overprice but still working ..."
3,Sound Quality Warning,"Warning this CD is protected by EMI's Copy Control. It will not play on a computer without installng additional soft software from the CD. You have no idea what is contained on this software. When played on a normal CD player, the sound quality is significantly degraded with lots of very unpleasant 'crackles' and 'pops.'"
2,Disappointed,"Being a fan of Hugh Laurie, I decided to investigate this collection, but it was disappointing. The humor was dated and at times crude. So sorry I bought this."
5,These Guys Are Just Amazing,"I haven't seen these shows in years, living in the states. Still make me laugh until I cry. What a great way to relax after a stressful day in the office!"
2,Don't waste your time or money.,"""Open this book as a Novice and Finish it as a Pro,"" that's what the cover says but this book is just about worthless. The author spends a lot of time telling you to click this and type that, without ever offering any coherent explanations for anything. You'll also find ridiculously out of place digressions about things like HTML. If you want to learn MSVC++ 5 look someplace else."
5,Holy music,A very powerful listening experience for religious or nonsecular people. Demonstrates the heart of the greatest Russian composer. Enjoy.
5,Absolutely beautiful!,"I really enjoyed this recording of Rachmaninoff's Divine Liturgy. The jewel case, in typical EMI fashion, is very pretty and pleasing to the eye. The booklet includes the handy, and mostly literal, translations of the words from Church Slavonic into other languages. As for the performance, it is exceptionally beautiful. I'm not sure that in Russian churches they use an all-male choir. But either way it still seems to work well. Their pronunciation was surprisingly good. Everything sounds really pure and clear. That's the best description for the singing in my opinion. The purity of sound is what I really enjoyed about this recording (though this may turn some people off). Rachmaninoff's work is absolutely wonderful. I really recommend this."
4,"a nice change from ""gloria in excelsis deo"" (... in infinitum :p )","I must say this is a very welcome change from the usual ""gloria in excelsis deo"" etc that I hear all the time in (mostly early) choral/vocal music. Not that I'm really sick of it, that's just what I'm used to & it's where I'm coming from. So compared to those recordings this one is sounds 'less complicated' than other choral music I have, I assume because of the restrictions on the composer. Most of the words are intelligible which also sets this work apart from the old-school stuff I'm used to. That's where the differences end though; although Rachmaninoff is a modern composer especially compared with Victoria, Rore, Palestrina, Morales, etc this work sounds like it was composed hundreds of years ago. I go for that old-school stuff because modern music usually sounds too discordant & 'weird' to me, but I really like this album. It doesn't sound like 20th-century stuff."
5,Wireless Adapter,"This wireless adapter is working well and I can recommend it to anyone looking for a PCI wireless adapter. Linksys was very clear that the adapter had to be installed before running the setup software. Pay attention to this. I ran into a problem installing the software, my own fault, and was not able to re-run the setup until I had uninstalled the software, deleted the device from my device manager, removed the adapter, rebooted, shut down, reinstalled the adapter, and started all over again. Once this was done I was able to re-run the setup again and all was well. Properly installed this is a fine product and the throughput is as advertised."
2,Boring snoozefest,"The trailers made this film out to be an action/thriller starring the man who trained Obi-Wan Kenobi and Batman. However, it's a slow-paced boring piece of film. If you were looking for a film like ""Taken"", you won't find it here."
2,One of the slowest and boring movie,This movie takes forever to get going and when it does get going its just boring and confusing. All i got from this movie is the wife and him aren't married they are terrorist or something. So dumb.
3,Starts off really good and then dries up,"It is a mystery, with some nice action scenes.The story starts off with this scientist coming to a convention. Suddenly, things start to go wrong, and he discovers that he may not be who he thought he was. People start to chase him, and people start to die. By which stage, I was starting to get into the movie. But then the story just started to go south. Your left wondering at the end whether the hero actions make sense. Without trying to give away the story, if I was him, and I learnt what he learnt I doubt I would act the way he did at the end.The acting was good. They played their characters well. I found them interesting.The filming was good, the action scenes were quite exciting.I would not see it again as I know the story, and I doubt I would recommend it, for anything else then a TV movie."
4,Good Movie,"I enjoyed the movie, true it could have been more action, but i enjoy Liam Neeson, I loved Taken it had action that keep you glued to the movie you didn't want to leave from in front of the TV."
4,FRANTIC,"Very similar to the Harrison Ford thriller Frantic, right down to the apartment of his female french accomplish. Heres a link if you like UNKNOWN you should enjoy this too.Frantic"
4,Liked it.,Very interesting.xxx xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx xxxxxxx xxx xxx xxx xxx xx xxxx xxxxx xx xxx xxx xxxx xxx xxx
1,"Bourne is dead , this is his corpse","I'm still not sure what this movie was about except that I saw a Bourne movie gone bad with no discernible plot , no direction , no talent maybe except for the young taxi driver that saved the (hero ? ) 's life , the only actor that gave a decent appearance and showed her craft. Everybody driving a car was clearly an expert , don't see them on my roads . And just what was this thing about ? I still don't know . Neeson stumbled through the story along with the rest of the cast , January Jones was about as frigid as the month she was named for , and Aiden Quinn was simply a bit of the background . I DIDN'T LIKE THIS FLICK MUCH ! ! !"
1,not same product,"while this movie was actually very good, it did not star liam neeson! it had great suspense and i enjoyed it."
4,Action Buff,"This is a great movie, if you like Action movies. He is a great actor. Liam Neeson always makes great action movies. I highly recommend this movie."
4,"An entertaining movie with a solid storyline, only weaker than Taken in the action scenes and the character played by Neeson","Because of the negative reviews, particularly those from fans of ""Taken"", I had hesitated much to pick ""Unknown"" up. Finally, I gave in to the attraction of Neeson and the marcom effort of the filmmaker. I am obliged to tell you that this is the best thriller action movie I saw this year. Not as good as ""Taken"", which is a classic, but not far behind, with a more captivating twist. For a night's entertainment after a day's hard work, this movie easily hits your target. For those who have higher preference of story over action, go for it at once. You will thank me for it."
2,Total Recall in Berlin,"I think a lot of reviewers missed it on this one - although it's based on a novel, the structure of the film, it's characters, situations, and actions, have been cobbled together into a poor remake of Total Recall. I realized this as soon as his wife didn't recognize him after he left the hospital, then it was easy to see where everything would go from there. I like Liam Neeson and he was adequate as was the rest of the cast, but the movie as a whole was a misfire."
4,I liked it but I wouldn't watch it again,"The show was a good show but it went on too long. I normally like longer shows but this took too many turns. I liked it, but I wouldn't watch it again."
3,Where's the outrage?,"Have you ever asked yourself, what would you do in a situation where they wake up from a coma (in a foreign country) and someone has stolen all of your identity? I know, that's something most people do all the time, right? (*wink*)The movie ""Unknown"" is as good as can be expected. Liam Neesan is a good actor for the role, but not truly believable in his role here.There are missing pieces to this movie, such as emotional outrage that any normal human would feel in a situation where they are backed into a corner scratching at anything to retrieve a thread of their identity.This film could use improvement, but is overall entertaining."
2,It's No Bourne Flick...,"I'm not surprised by the mixed reviews on this movie because I watched it with four other people and we were split on what we thought of the movie. I was in the camp that did not see it favorably. The problem is that I can't quite put my finger on what is wrong with the movie. All of the ingredients are there: a man develops amnesia, everyone he remembers doesn't remember him, people are after him, there's action, it takes place in Berlin, top actors are in the movie. But yet it didn't work for me. It was like someone threw all of the right ingredients together but forgot to stir and put it in the oven at 400F.The acting, in my opinion was poor. The action scenes were too brief and predictable for my taste.This movie seemed to borrow heavily from the Bourne movies, but didn't use any of the elements it borrowed in a new way. The final twists are verging on preposterous as well. I won't go into detail, but I found it hard to buy.Overall, I don't recommend this movie."
4,Really Good,"4.5 stars, only because I guess when you compare it to Liam's ""Taken"" from a few years earlier, it was a slight let down, but on its own it is a very good action-mystery."
4,Not a bad Liam Neeson movie,"Unknown does keep you guessing and can be pretty intense at times, but I'd rather watch Taken over this one."
5,"Excellent, Sexy Romantic Read!","This was an incredible story! The heroine was strong, sexy, intelligent and independent. The hero was sexy but sensitive, strong, just perfect! I loved the plot line, their family and friends were all loving and warm. The sex was yummy hot!"
4,I enjoyed it,Not great but enjoyable none the less. I wish they had spent more time talking about the kids high school life.
4,Engineering Mechanics : Statics,"The book as a matter of fact covers all the basic subjects required for a future understanding of strength of materials. The explanations are quite long, and shorter sentences could have made it more attactive as an excellent text book. I do recommend it as a text book for a basic course."
4,photo-filled intro to amateur astronomy,"1,750 entries, 350 color photos and 35 essays written by experts"
4,Insightful!,"Throughout the 1990s, consultants were the kings of business and one firm, McKinsey & Co., reigned above all others. In The McKinsey Mind, Ethan M. Raisel and Paul N. Friga, former McKinsey & Co. consultants, describe the methods that the famed firm uses in improving the performance of its consultants. These techniques, which relate to problem solving, management and communications, combine to produce the equivalent of a basic MBA textbook. But unlike much of your grad-school reading, this one is right on target to address your real-life business executive. As such, we from getAbstract recommend this book not just for its McKinsey cachet, but for its applicable approaches to business."
4,"Nice book, great concepts","It is a nice book, however, I enjoy reading Victor Cheng's blog and emails much better. I subscribed to [...] (free) and I find it a lot more helpful and intresting than books on consulting I was able to find so far"
2,Too Sickly Sweet Sugary for my tastes,"This book is the story of the Acadians being exiled from Canada and how they landed in Louisiana. It is written as if a Grandmother is telling the story to her grandchildren.Here are my big problems with this book-First it really isn't directed to a younger age group because of the language (high vocabulary words). It is almost too childish for an older age group. About the only group that it might be appropriate for is the middle school age child. However, they wouldn't tolerate the sugary words.It is too sickly sweet for my tastes. Open any page and it reads something like this 'My dear children, he said 'my good friends, our hopes have been dashed and our hopes were illusory.' Or 'They vied with each other in their kind offices with so much grace that it only added more charm'.It is an interesting read if you want to learn about the Acadian exile. However, there are other books out there that I feel do a credible job without all the sugary words."
4,Easy temporary shades,"Look good for temporary shades, you can cut them to size, and they're super easy to ""install"". I got a nasty paper cut while mounting it to the window though so be careful!"
4,So far it has been very helpful,"I pulled a muscle in my back about two months ago, with limited success visits with the chiropractor and the massage therapist, I opted to purchase this book, along with a Thera-Cane. So far the results have been promising. I have found at least two areas that I have been working on with very positive results. I have given this book to my father as he had some lower back issues. I hope his results are as promising as mine have been.I would recommend this book."
4,Hope on the horizon,This book offers a detailed treatment of the topic of self-treatment. Learning takes significant effort and time devotion - kind of like putting time aside for a course. I felt enormous relief and hope that I will succeed in improving my chronic pain from reading case descriptions of people who have struggled just like me! I have booked an appointment with a registered massage therapist who does trigger point massage and who will help me develop self-treatment skills. I am grateful to have found an avenue of potential solution to my pain thanks to this book.
4,Good resource,"As a rookie to trigger point therapy, I found this book to be easy to understand and it helped me locate and hit many different trigger points using the body back buddy device. It also explains the use of the theracane as well."
5,Greatest Trigger Point Therapy Book,"This book is just wonderful, information on taking control of healing ourselves, a wealth of self help information..Every Doctor should read this book too."
5,Educate Yourself !!!!,"You'll never regret the investment. I started to have a problem with migraines about a year and a half ago(very painful) and I went through a whole string of profesionals(Dr,Chiro,LMT,etc..)to find out what the problem was. Either no one knows about trigger points or they don't want to be bothered. In other words, no one was very helpful.I decided to help myself and its been working out pretty well. By educating yourself about trigger points you will save time and money and Clair Davies proves that you don't have to be educated as a Dr. to understand and get to know your own body.Highly Recommended!"
5,Well organized and easy to understand,"Love this book. Very easy to find recommended trigger points for symptoms, as a lay person. Using this with the Tigger Point Massage Balls and Trigger Points Quick Study Guide. Very effective and relatively easy to implement in to a busy schedule."
5,Trigger Point Therapy,"WARNING: If you don't know what the letters after the Author's name stand for, this book is probably not for you either. I bought this book figuring I would be able to figure it out. I was incorrect in that assumption. This book is so over my head because I am not a Massage Therapist, so I don't know the terminology necessary to apply the lessons within. This book is EXTREMELY detailed. Seems to be a great teaching tool for someone who knows the body. I am going to send it to my cousin who is a Certified Massage Therapist, she would find it useful and maybe I can get a discount on my next massage!"
4,Great Help,I have used the recommendations in this book for pain in my neck and hip. They are easy to follow and have proven to be helpful for relieving my pain.
5,TOTO - LIVE IN AMSTERDAM DVD,"I have seen at least one show of every Toto tour since 1986, and for me this captures one of their best. Whilst the hits were necessarily included to appeal to a wider fan base, there is ample album material and new arrangements for musicians and discerning music fans. Toto fanatics and cynics alike can get a flavour of the humour of this band on their own backstage video footage. Even if Toto don't achieve the recognition they deserve in their lifetime's, this DVD will be an excellent testimony to what Eddie Van Halen described as ""collectively the best musicians on the planet"". Fantastic post-production on both visual and especially the surround sound audio mixes."
4,Great Production and Sound - Poor song selection,"The video and sound production are top notch. You feel like the band is in your living room. They also sound extremely good in this performance. I can't believe Bobby Kimaball can still hit those high notes. So why only 4 stars. The song selection could have been better - Where was Stop Loving You and Pamela. Also, the track listing doesn't match with what's being played. And those two medleys. I hate concert DVD's that include medleys. You can't skip forward to song 2 or 3 in the medley because it treats it as one chapter stop. Play the whole song or don't play it all. If your a diehard Toto fan, then get it - you'll love it. If your a radio Toto fan - You'll only end up playing a few songs on it."
1,Please Dont Buy it,"I was really disappointed with Toto. My favorite songs of all time is ""Hold the Line"" i brought this DVD mainly because of that. They just totally screwed it up it sounds so different, the lead singer is atrocious i could do a better job than him. Steve lukather i thought was a great guitarist but he totally disappointed me the solos have no resemblence to waht your hear in their studio albums. The rest of the band is ok. The song I liked the most in the dvd is ""Africa"". The audio and video are excellent.VERDICT: If you are a hardcore TOTO fan you might like it otherwise please dont buy it."
3,OK,"I love the TOTO of old, but they are not the band they once were.Audio and video quality good, but song selection poor, many of their classic songs missing and it was very obvious they now can't hit the notes they once could.1 star for video quality, 1 star for audio quality, 1 star because I used to love Toto, not sure now though after watching this one!"
5,Fine Musical Performance,"This is one of the finest DVD music performances, period. Aside from Mr. Kimball getting extremely pained-looks on his face, even during the sweet and gentle ""I Won't Hold You Back,"" he really carried the highest notes strongly. Steve Lukather bears a striking resemblance (physically and musically) to Journey's Neil Schon, and that's a compliment! I have to disagree with the reviewer that thought the song selection was a reason for a lesser rating. A music DVD should be reviewed only on the songs played and the quality of the recording. This fine collection, (which includes a medley-sampling of ""99"")comes clear and sharp in video and DTS-audio. The musicianship is first-rate, vocal harmonies crisp, and the drumbeats powerful. This one rocks! A must for any melodic-rock fan."
5,Outstanding DVD.......!!!,"This DVD ""Live IN Amsterdam"" ROCKS...! The sound is incredible and the video footage is the best i have seen in a DVD ""Live"" Concert. All aspects of this DVD is a must have...! The song selection (in random order) is great and they put on one Hell of a show...! Every part of this DVD's footage is incredibly clear and shows every band member during each song performing ""their hearts out"". I have many live DVD's of groups performing live in concert, but this DVD beats them all. I would highly recommend any ""TOTO"" fan to rush out and have this in your DVD collection..! Good work, To TOTO and to the people involved in this excellent production...!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,The wait is over!,"The buzz is that this long-awaited DVD will be a hit with not only the ""Totonians"", but with anyone with an appreciation for the fine musicianship that this group is known for. I am giving this DVD an advance rating of five stars because I have seen them live, and it was one of the most satisfying concerts I have ever attended!"
5,Great if you know the songs.,I know Africa and Rosanna. Dont know the other songs. The sound and picture quality is great. Channel separation is great too. This HD-DVD was well done.
3,Interesting,"Margaret Anderson, Georgette Leblanc,Dorothy Caruso, Elizabeth Jens Clark, Solita Solano, Kathryn Hulme, Jannet Flanner... they are the most interesting part of the book, what Mathilda Hills tells in the preface. The book has many interesting pictures of all of them.The Forbiden Fires story is a good story that gets much more interesting if one knows about Anderson life, about her lovers, work and the times she lived in."
3,GOOD QUALITY CROCK,I LOVE THIS CROCKPOT BECAUSE IT IS VERSAWARE WHICH ALLOWS YOU TO BROWN THE MEAT AND OTHER THINGS BEFORE YOU START THE CROCKPOT. IT ALLOWS YOU TO SKIP DIRTYING A DIFFERENT PAN BEFORE. THE ONLY BAD SIDE IS THAT I WISH THE BOTTOM OF IT WAS AS BIG AS THE TOP. SOMETIMES IT IS A LITTLE CRAMMED TO PROPERLY BROWN THINGS BUT AFTER THAT IT IS GREAT. I HAVE USED THIS PIECE OF EQUIPMENT FOR SEVERAL YEARS NOW WITHOUT DISAPPOINTMENT. IT IS EASY TO CLEAN.
4,Great,"I loved this crock pot. I retired my old one for this one. The only down side was that the crock cracked. However, it was under warranty and I am told that I will be receiving a new one shortly.I use it to cook a whole chicken, make chili, beans, soup, stews. It really is awesome, can't wait to get the new one. Other similiar crocks are twice as much money. Can't beat this one!"
5,"Trying to find this book, no luck so far.",This book was highly recommended to me by the head of the repair dept. at my local Toyota dealership as THE book to have as permanent reference for my 1975 20R engine.
4,Out Of This World...,"Very interesting characters but too bad they had to die to reconcile with one another. The only strong charater in this novel is the little person Irene, whom in spite of a very disturbing childhood manages to become a winner, which goes to prove that you have to do the best with what you have. Alice Walker has a different approach on expressing the joys and pains a family lives through with lasting consequences. A very entertaining book."
2,an author's ego revealed,"Having only seen the movie The Color Purple on which to base my curiosity about Alice Walker, I was looking forward to a great story. Unfortunately, the first person narration switched around from character to character forcing me to think a bit more than I would like to when reading for pleasure. I found the details of the lesbian lovemaking to be more than I ever wanted to know about lesbian relationships - and the assumption that my dead relatives spy on me in my bed quite revolting. The story was unique but never 'captured' me. Nonetheless, Ms. Walker is truly one of the most daring writers of the twentieth century."
3,This was a challenge,"This book has a dream like quality as it slips between time and place. It moves seamlessly from one narrator to another just as Susannah moves between lovers.This is a novel about love, life and death. I am glad that I read it. I am unlikely to recommend it to my mother in law, but I feel that it is a novel which all fathers should read."
1,just dreadful,This book is so awful that it would not have been published if the author wasn't Alice Walker. So much drival and meaningless reflection.
2,Cheap and easy = short lifespan,"When I was shopping for an mp3 player, I wasn't looking for something really expensive, just something cheap and easy to use for when I worked out. It is extremely easy to upload and remove songs from - so easy I didn't even have to read the directions. No software to install. It doesn't hold an impressive amount of songs, around 50 to 55, depending on the length of the songs. I personally did not like the earbuds because they weren't padded and were uncomfortably large for my ears. I would recommend this mp3 player to the person just looking for something cheap and easy to use, but don't expect it to last you a long time - it only took a mere 5 months for mine to die on me, and I took good care of it."
1,a budget c s lewis,"For years Peter Kreeft has been trying to be the new C. S. Lewis. For years he has failed. He lacks the learning, the style, and the wit. He should stick to teaching philosophy at Boston University and abandon his endless series of superficial books(never acknowledged by professionals)which only serve to show how much he owes to other thinkers and how utterly unoriginal he is."
1,NOT THE BEST CHOICE,"If your child has a food allergy, this is not a cookbook I would recommend. It seems to me the authors went through some other cookbook, picking out recipes that sounded like foods kids would like. All they did to call it a book for kids with allergies is list in what you could substitute when a dairy product, eggs, or wheat is listed which is not particularly user-friendly. There is also a danger in that whenever cheese is listed as an ingredient, they simply tell you to substitute ""non-dairy cheese."" While it does exist, it is not always easy to find and you have to be really careful because most of the so called lactose or dairy free cheeses contain ""casein"" which is a milk protein-dangerous dangerous dangerous for a milk-allergic child! (I know from experience as my 16 month old has a severe dairy and egg allergy.) You would be much better off with the book by Coss or the one put out by the Food Allergy Network."
5,A Must Read for the Serious Preacher,"This book is for anyone who is serious about preaching; even if you have been preaching for a while! For the new preacher, Lowry explains how to make your sermons interesting, Biblical, relevent, specific and memorable! For the seasoned preacher he illuminates several ideas that you may already be aware of subconciously by using in depth analysis of the five parts of ""the sermon as preached"" and by giving excelent examples and analogies. Even if you do not adopt his specific format this book enables you to make your style more effective and crisper. This book should be in every preacher's library!"
1,Disappointed,"I bought this for my wife. It did not come in Blass box, but an envelope. Unlike other Blass perfumes, the scent lasted no more than a couple of hours compared to other Blass perfumes lasting all day. Wife also said she received no compliments from her co-workers compared to many with other products. It was almost like it was a cheap imitation of the product."
5,a new favorite,"I am partial to retelling of fairy tales. I've read at least 5 other re-tellings of this particular one. The ones that retain the magic are M/F and the only other one that is F/F strips the story of the magic and sets the story in early twentieth century USA. When I reached the end of this book - a novella in reality - I wanted more. Wolfe writes with a deft hand. It is a pity she died so young. I wondered for a while what the monstrosity of this particular beast was, only to find that her love of women made her a monster. The delight of this story for me was in following Angelique as she works to convince Drew that she isn't a monster and that Angelique does in fact love her and wants to spend her life with Drew.I've only had the book a short time and have already read it twice. It is one of my two favorite retellings of Beauty and the Beast"
5,Good play for young actors,"I am in the 8th grade and have just read the play ""A Play Called Noahs Flood"" It is all about the troubles of a village in medevil england that is attempting to put on a play for a play festival. The lead character (John) has the task of directing it, but it isnt easy along the way. For he has a wife who wont speak her lines, a son who wants to join the military instead of going to college, and the entire village whose hard work is ruptured by a surprise visit by the judge two weeks before expected. I was cast as John and had a wonderful time doing it. There was much room to add characters as needed, and set design was simple. I reccomend this play to any 7-9th grade theatre students who are interested in a fun play to preform."
1,not enough,"A great 50's show, perhaps the prototye for ""The 70's Show"", a series with the TV's most beautiful golddigging goddess Thalia Menninger (Tuesday Weld), Maynard G Krebs (""Work!"" Bob Denver, aka Gilligan), clothes-hound Milton Armitage (Warren Beatty), dwarfish Zelda Gilroy (propinquity) and let's not forget the rich Chatsworth Osborne Jr (Family motto ""Never dip into Capital"").However for $18+ you get only 2 twenty-five minute (without commercials) episodes. Poor quality print.Poor value for the money."
4,Great Read,I loved the book! It was a very fast paced great read! I can't wait to see the movie. I was a little disappointed that the story ended so fast. I was wanting to read more!
5,"Durable, inexpensive workhorse","I run a fleet of six cellphones in my family which currently includes 3 of these tough, entry level phones. My kids are capable of killing nicer phones, but have had a hard time with the Nokia 6010. It's a basic GSM phone that works like a tank. There's no speakerphone, but the texting features (predictive if you want it) are just fine (kids just have to text). The cool thing is if your kid happens to destroy or drown the phone, try to salvage the SIM card, grab another phone used online (may require unlocking, not too difficult), plug in the SIM card and you should be up and running again. I've done this three times now. It takes a full immersion or a devastating fall to kill this phone. I've used one of these phones myself for awhile (while I was setting it up for my daughter).There are tons of aftermarket accessories for this phone, and they'll be around for awhile yet."
5,Enjoy old sitcoms,I really enjoy all the old sitcoms that played around or after I was born. Lucy was just so hilarious in all the situations she ended up in.
5,The Fur Coat,"I have all 7 seasons of ""I Love Lucy"" on CD and love them. I am now working at getting them on my kindle. Imagine getting to watch Lucy while you are out and have some down time and have NO wi-fi connection. If you love lucy I recommend buying all 7 seasons for your kindle. A great way to brighten your day."
3,Stone Fox,The title of this book is Stone Fox by John Reynolds Gardiner. My favorite character in this book is Little Willie. The story took place at the farm. I learned that you have to pay taxes on farms. If you don't pay the taxes you can lose the land. I think it was an O.K. book. I would recommend this book to a friend.
4,a book review of Stone Fox,I thought Stone Fox was great. Grandfather knew the taxes were $500 and he was shocked. Grandfather was sick so he wasn't able to work. Willy planned to help his grandfather raise $500 to pay the taxes on the farm. Will Willy be able to help his grandfather raise the money? Would you like to read the book?
5,The book was very touching to read along with my son.,The story of Stone Fox was very interesting to me. My son was required to read this book for his summer reading list. The struggle that young people go through in life is sometimes overlooked. I feel that Gardiner focuses on the struggles. Willy has decided to save the farm and what he believes to be his Grandfathers life. In this story a young boy must make adult decisions. Willy could have easily let his Grandfather stay with someone else but he chose to care for him and perform the chores of raising a crop. These are very mature decisions made by a young boy. I could feel the love Willy had for his Grandfather as well as the love Searchlight had for Willy. Although the ending was sad it allowed us to view the reality of life. Some struggles end in death and not with happy endings. I would encourage people to read and look beyond the words on the pages. This book was intense with emotional moments that would bring tears to anyones eyes.
4,Sad but good,Stone Fox is a good book but sad and short. It's fairly easy and is good on the kindle fire. I'd recommend it. I like how Mat is trying to survive by himself.
4,Good book,I knew the ending to the book cause I read the book about a year back and felt touched each time all in all I'd say this is a fine price of short literature that I highly advise you to read
1,This was awful!,"This book was the worst one ever! I realy hated it!!! It burned my eyes to read it... I mean ""Litte"" Willy? What kind of a name is that? A dog THAT old couldn't poll a plow, let alone run that fast!"
3,willy and stone fox,Willy is a farm boy. His gandfather is ill. Willy enters a race. Willy is against stone fox the winner of all races. Will willy win or will stone fox ? Find out by reading the book!!!!!!!!!
3,A great book,"A boy named Little Willy starts off as a regular boy in Wyoming. But as the book progresses, Willy's Grandfather gets sick. Willy enters a race that no one thinks he'll win. Will Little Willy's Grandfather get better? Will Willy win the race?Read the book to find out!"
3,Reveiwed by a Bunny,"The name of this book is Stone Fox by John Reynolds Gardiner. This is a good book. The main characters are Little Willie, Stone Fox, Searchlight, and Grandfather. Little Willie enters a race to win[a lot of money] to save the farm. If you want to know who wins the race, you should read Stone Fox. This is a very good book."
3,Stone Fox,"The book Stone Fox was written by John Reynolds Gandinier. This book was ok. Little Willy had a big problem. He had to participate in a race to save his grandfather's farm. Sad things been to happen, like when his Grandfather gets sicker.Then Willy comes home and finds a stranger at his house. To find out what happens read the book Stone Fox."
2,Stone Fox,"My book review is about Stone Fox by John Reynolds Gardiner. My favorite character is Little Willie. The reason I didn't like this book is because it didn't have much action, only a race. I did not learn anything new in this book. The characters are Doc Smith, the grandfather, Little Willie, Searchlight, Clifford Snyder, Stone Fox, Mr. and Mrs.Foster, and Lester."
4,An exciting story and an easy read.,"Stone Fox is a great book for everyone. It is easy to read and not long at all. It has 81 pages and 10 chapters, which makes it easy for anyone to read. It's a book about a boy and his grandfather living at a farm. The grandpa gets sick for some reason, so the ten year old boy needs to raise money for the taxes and help his grandfather get better at the same time. He decides to enter the dog sledding contest with his dog named Searchlight against an Indian named Stone Fox. I really enjoyed this book even though I'm in sixth grade and the reading was easy. I don't want to give away the ending, so read this terrific book for yourself!"
1,Awesome Book,The book I read was called Stone Fox by John Reynolds Gardiner. My favorite character was Stone Fox because he had a gun and five Samoyeds. The setting of this book was at a race that Willy entered and won. He won money for his grandpa's farm. My favorite part was the race because it was fun. I recommend this book to you.
2,review of stone fox,I give this book a 2 stars because It wasen't the best book in the world.I don't like it that grandfather is sick and Lile Willy needs coleg money
4,"Willie, Searchlight, and Stone Fox W","Willie, Search light, and Stone FoxThe book Stone Fox by John Reynolds Gardiner was a good book. My favorite character was Searchlight because she was always loyal to Willie. The book took place in the country. I learned that some of the Native Americans tried to buy the land back that they lost. If I was the author, I would have changed the ending of the book because I didn't really like it. I would probably recommend this book to a friend."
3,Stone Fox,"I think Stone Fox was a pretty good book by John Reynolds Gardiner. My favorite character is little Willie because he has a lot of will power for a little boy. The story took place at a farm area. I learned that although things get tough, never to give up no matter what. I would recommend this book for someone who likes action books."
4,Make suer you have Tissues :),"This is a really good book, my 8 year daughter told me I had to read it because it made her cry in school. Yup she was right really good book and brought the tears to my eyes. Very good for young children."
4,Stone Fox is a great book,The name of this book is Stone Fox by John Reynolds Gardiner. My favorite character is Little Willie because when he says he will do something he does it. The story took place in the country. I didn't know there were sled races in the country. I would recommend this book to a student.
5,Tender Shepherd is a masterpiece,"Kim Robertson is one of the best Celtic harpers of the day. She performs her own arrangements of tastefully selected melodies, and she does this with skill and artistry.One would expect an element of simplicity in a album of lullabies. Robertson's simplicity is radiant. This is one of the most relaxing CDs I own and I recommend it for everyone who likes New Age music, Celtic music, or simply gentle music. This is the 5th copy of Tender Shepherd that I have purchased. When people hear my CD, they love it, so I share it with them and buy another! This also makes a great new baby gift."
2,BORING--They turned 9/11 into a chick flick!,"This could have been a spectacularly produced action movie with dazzling special effects. And, I was hoping that the main feeling the movie intended to invoke in its viewers is a renewed horror and anger at what those scumbag terrorists did to this country on that infamous day. Instead, they focus on only two of the hundreds of heroes involved in the tragedy, and hone in on the same old warm and fuzzy feelings about kids and marriages ""tainted"" by stupid trivial things like remodeling kitchens--BORING! While the support that the two main characters lent each other, and resulting in both being rescued, is indeed inspiring, I thought the movie got way too focused on one little story of the whole incident, rather than showing what happened on a grander scale. Luckily I only rented the DVD and did not buy it--it's not worth it. You can buy any number of chick flicks in the $5.50 bin at WalMart."
4,Good movie...A look from within.,World Trade Center movie brought the viewer inside the twin towers during the dramatic part when the first tower went down. The screams and horrors were enough to make want to run away from the TV screen.
1,Capitalization on tragedy,"Actually I never saw this,I boycotted it like any sensible person.capitalizing on terrorism and tragedy is disgraceful.aparently most people thought so since their hasnt been many films of this tragedy except documentaries made."
5,Used dvds,Order was shipped next day and arrived in very good condition and viewed like new. I would order from this person again.
1,"This is disgusting, not literally","I find the fact that this movie has been made to be disgusting. This movie should be FREE OF CHARGE if it is made at all. Personally, I think it's too soon to make a MOVIE about all those who died. What's worse is that someone is making MILLIONS off the deaths of thousands of Americans. They're not donating it to charities or the families of the victims. NO! They're pocketing it and buying their mansions and super cars. It's SICK, using our nation's tragedy to further themselves."
1,That's twice Hollywood has done injustice to 9/11!,"First they blew it with United 93, now this. I'm not saying that the two cops that this film is about didn't deserved to have their story told. But what about the thousands of other people who died in the Twin Towers? Ironic how the film is called 'World Trade Center' but there is not one freakin scene in the movie that takes place inside the Twin Towers. Viewers should know what THOSE people went through as well and what compelled some of them to jump out of the windows. Instead, the movie bores us with overlong scenes of idle chit-chat of the two trapped cops and annoying ""tear-jerker"" scenes of their bawling wives. Give us a break!!!"
3,DVD,I was not very happy with this DVD. I thought it would deal with more of the real time events. It only mainly dealt with Port Authority officals.
3,World Trade Center,Wasn't really a good movie as I expected more about the trade center. Moved to slow for me.
1,Somebody should have done more research,"I think this book was written very irresponsibly. Because I am a recovering self-injurer, I felt very offended! This is a very poor representation of what it's like, or can be like. Of all the self-injurers I'm familiar with, this is not a fair representation of any of them. The main character comes across as a confused, selfish teenager. Not every self-injurer is a ""druggy"" and most do NOT do it for the attention. I just think that this book is cashing in on a very serious problem without giving it the attention it needs."
3,above par book,"I thought the book crosses was a good way to see the problems teenagers have to face wheather it is a drug problem, sexual problems or even self inflicting injuries as a problem for alot of teenagers."
4,One of my top ten favourite books,"I can totally relate to how Nancy feels! I'm a cutter too, so I also know how cutting feels like an endorphin rush. A way to feel better. This book is wonderfully written."
1,Yet the worst Jim Carry movie.,"Always liked Jim Carry as an actor. But this movie just bad.Malicious and scatological humor, no real values.Screenwriters made a good job ruining a good idea."
5,GREAT FUN.....,"Between Mr. Popper's Penguins and The ZooKeeper, ... I liked them both, but I liked Mr. Popper's Penguins more. Kids loved it too. Nice story. Has been while since I saw a Jim Carrey movie,... thought he did a good job in this role. And the penguins are hilarious! I didn't quite get that incredible name of Mr. Popper's assistant,.... with the fun voice and accent, ... miss P (?),... but I liked her character/role too. So many fun scenes in this movie. We had a good time."
1,As lame as reviewed,"Wanted to give this movie a try, despite the bad reviews I read of it, because my girls and I had just finished reading the classic chapter book. This movie was a complete disappointment. Very little held true to the original. Crude language. Cheesy!! Painful to watch, really."
3,Mr Popper's Penguins,"Good family movie and funny, I liked it and kids love it, men aren't thrilled with it, but I like Jim Carry in most movies."
4,typical Annie Solomon read,"If you like/love Annie Solomon, you'll feel the same about this book! Got all her books on Kindle now. They don't disappoint. :)"
1,Disappointed....,"First off, I bought this since I am a Final Fantasy fan, and looking at the pics with a BLACK handle, and the price was right, i jumped on it immediately... well, you get what you pay for. I got a gunblade with a WOODEN handle instead, it doesn't look as good as th pics, the barrel of the gunblade is really flat, thats probably why you don't get a view from the bottom, it just really cheaply made... It would have looked better with a black handle, a barrel that sticks out a bit farther, and maybe a little more detail such as having the lion drawing on both sides of the blade, and in yellow or gold like in the game. Buyers beware...you won't get what you see in the pics."
4,Better than it looks.,The Sandcrawler never looked that fun to me but my kids got it for Christmas. It is actually a lot better to play with than it looked. The inside is wider than it seemed and the model comes with a lot of tank tread pieces. Two of the tracks swivel to steer.
5,"An amazing, funny and witty addition to the Vampire genre","All of the pre-publication buzz about Mario Acevedo's debut novel, The Nymphos of Rocky Flats, was certainly not undeserved. The cover is perfect, and from the moment I picked the book up and started reading, I couldn't stop laughing.I can't wait for book #2 in Winter '07!!!"
1,I disagree!,"I read the book, then read the other reviews thinking others would feel the same way I did about this book- utterly disappointed! The plot is so convoluted and complicated! It felt like the author didn't know what kind of book he wanted to write, so he just wrote everything into this book. Vampires, aliens, nymphs, you name it, it's in there! It's a soldier's vampire book with an alien plot and a little bit of sex thrown in for good measure. For a book with this title, I expected more lurid sex scenes, but was disappointed with that aspect of this book too. Maybe in the next book, the author will pick a topic and stick to it! Either way, I'll never know because I don't plan on reading any more novels in this series, ever!"
4,Good story,It was a fun book with a lot of entertainment I'm smacked out my dome yeah boy asap tell entertainment somethin
4,good for being portable,This is a good swing because of the portability. It is not our first choice swing because it does not have any lights or music or motion. But it has held up very well over the last year and the girls like it.
4,Second time buyer,"I just bought this to replace a 3 yr old swing. It's solid enough but I agree - it's a bit boring compared some some that have lights and sound. My 3 mo old looked around for entertainment when first placed in it but I've velcroed other toys to it and will use plastic links to attach something more solid when the time comes. I don't like swings with overhead pieces as they're awkward when you take the baby out, especially if you have an older grandma dealing with these sorts of contraptions. Both my children used to stiffen their legs and push off the chair straight into the overhead bar, often forcing tears if you weren't careful taking them out. Overall it's a good buy. I'd buy another in a heartbeat and I'm known as a picky mother."
5,Great swing for the price,"I bought this swing for my 2 month old mainly because it was ""plain""-- without all the bells and whistles. My son loves it!! It does what it is supposed to do, and that is provide him with a soothing swinging motion while I get some much needed hands free time. I also love the fact that I can carry him in it from room to room. Also the compact size and the way it folds up for easy storage. But best of all is you can't beat the price!! Trust me, I have tried other swings with my other two children and I could not be happier with this swing for my third."
1,doesn't work well,The seat sits so far back he was foot over head when sitting in the swing. He would cry the whole time he was in it.
5,Excellent Replacement Mouse,"I have an old iMac with an older OS, so I was concerned when I replaced my mouse that the new mouse might not work with my older OS... but the Logitech V100 Optical Mouseworks fine with Mac OS 10.3.9. Not all of its features operate with my older system, but it scrolls up & down and clicks just fine. The package says it can also scroll side to side, and has a zoom option, but these don't work with my old OS... but who cares? Reasonably priced and well-built, it serves my uses just fine, and when I buy a new computer next year, this mouse will rise to the occasion. I liked it so much I bought a second one to keep as back-up just in coase."
2,Two stars for Esme and Sebastian!,"I found this to be the worst of Ms. Jame's books. The only reason I would recommend it is to get to know Gina's friends, who have books that center more on them later. I found Gina and Cam to be unrealistic; or maybe just that I didn't care for them. However, Esme and Sebastian were what spurred me on to read more in this series."
1,third person garbage,"just a piece of crap , i paid 3 bucks and played it for a half hour or so and it just has no direction whatsoever just a mess , i can't recommend this at any price not even if it was free"
3,"Such a wonderful location, but so repetitive","I think the core of the game only has a dozen or so missions. The box says it has over 300 missions, which is almost a lie. What it has are maybe 15-20 meaningless side missions set in 20-30 different locations. I thought they had really thought up a nifty way of generating missions but they just cut 'n pasted the same ones all over the island.I thought the views were remarkable. Worthy of a better game. I experienced a few hiccups and lags, but I'm used to that on my sub-prime machine.Really, try to get this game for under $15, which is what I feel it's worth."
5,Bomberman is RAD!,"This game is GREAT, and the fact that you only need one game to do battle mode between friends is great!"
3,"OK, sort of","This book, like everyone has said, was really good at the beginning, but gradually deteriorated towards the end. I was really looking forward to see how Napoli would do the ending interestingly, and was really disappointed by its sudden stop, which really left me feeling like there was something missing, that she could have added a lot more to make this better. I think the awful ending more or less ruined this good book, and I really wish that Napoli had tried a little harder to make the ending better. I wouldn't really recommend this book unless you're willing to put up with a horrible ending, because the rest of the book is actually pretty good. It's just too bad that she screwed up the ending so much..."
3,Definately not her best!,"First of all, if you want a really good Napoli book, read Zel. Most of her stories are based on fairy tales and Spinners is based on the age old story of Rumplestiltsken. Basically, it starts by telling Rumplestlitsken's story. He was in love with the weaver's daughter, but she was engaged to the miller. She gets pregnant and the miller thinks it is his child. Then it fast forwards to the story that we were told, except it's different. Unlike Zel, this story is told from one viewpoint. And the story kind of moves at a slow pace. You're not very invovled in what's going on. Overall, it was an okay book. Read it for the ending."
5,Sad But Good,"I've never really enjoyed the story of Rumpelstiltskin but this story was so moving that I thoroughly enjoyed it. The tailor/spinner in the story is never referred to by his real name, instead he is just ""tailor."" When he was young he was in love with a farmer's daughter who was a spinster. In exchange for her hand in marriage the farmer demands a wedding gown made of gold. In making the gown by turning straw into gold on an old spinning wheel the young man cripples himself and becomes deformed. The young woman then scorns him and marries a miller.Later, the woman has his child (they'd slept together before he became crippled) and dies in childbirth. The story then chronicles the daughter's journey to adulthood and queenship in parallel with the tormented life of the tailor.Overall an extremely sad book that makes you really feel sorry for the tailor but one that is exquisitely written."
3,"Superb conducting, but....","The problem with this recording is not, and never was, Furtwangler's superb conducting, nor the great singing of Flagstad or Fischer-Dieskau; but the mediocre singing of Ludwig Suthaus and Blanche Thebom, and the wobbly voice of Josef Griendl, make this recording a third choice at best. My favorite ""Tristan"" is the one with Nilsson, Vickers, Hesse, Berry and Karl Bohm or the 1936 Flagstad performance with Melchior and Fritz Reiner."
2,Very dissapointing,I bought this book here on Amazon because of its cover and description but had I thumbed through its pages in a bookstore then I never would have bought it.144 pages of its 236 total pages are very primitive illustrations and the seal of the individual spirit. Even those only take up half a page each. I would say that well over 60% of this book is just padding.Other than the few pages that describe the evocation of Orobas I would say that this book stinks and that there is nothing new or useful in it for anybody who has any of the key of solomon texts.
2,Cheesy and uninspired version of classic Crowley material,"This can be summed up in a few words - despite the usually reliable standards amd scholarship of DuQuette and Hyatt - this is a cheaply and badly produced book with terrible illustrations that do no justice to the glory of the subject. For the Goetia, there are several better texts and editions. For sexual evocation, one would be better advised to get something like Frater UD's SECRETS OF THE SEX MAGICIANS or even a standard work on tantric lovemaking and supplement it by reading Crowley's writings on the subject in BOOK 4 and elsewhere...."
5,Goodnight Guitar By Ray Penney,"Truly an excellent collection of music and guitar performance for the kids and adults too. With the dozens of childrens cd's that we own, this one is always on top of the pile and in the cd player."
5,The best!,"I love the way my senior cats have actually improved in coat quality, BMI and overall health since switching from Eukanuba Senior to this. A couple of visitors did not recognize them and asked who they were, they were astonished. They don't look 18, but 4-5 y/o now. Cat and kitten is a wonderful concept too. They love the taste and finish every bit if you give proper amounts each feeding or pick up and cover after 30 mins of dining."
1,It aint nothing serious,"I got this Cd and was listining to it and i must say it aint one of them that make ya run out and tell your friends. It's not bad, but it aint great either. It could use some major improvement."
2,Aite.,This CD aint to bad for a new commer. It needs alot of work to even be considered a contender in this rap field.
4,memories!,So many songs from high school days were on this CD. I set my favorites to repeat and sing along loudly in the car. It makes the commute to and from work so much easier!
1,useless,"This gate is almost totally useless -- unless your doorways and walls are all /perfectly/ plumb and square AND happen to fit the arbitrary slots where the gate will allow you to engage the lock, that is..."
3,"Does the job, but man it's ugly","We purchased this gate to use at the landing of the second level steps of a townhouse (there are three levels total; the top floor and the steps headed down to the ground level are covered by metal gates). We wanted to use it as a pressure gate, but it turned out that we couldn't use it that way and had to drill into the wall and banister. It worked fine until my son decided that he wanted to know how to open the gate and developed a game out of pushing the handle down and begging me to lift it up again. When we finally took it down we were stunned at just how imposing of a structure it is, and were relieved that it was no longer there. It does the job, but it is quite imposing."
5,PERFECT gate for areas that have base moldings,"I needed a gate for my 41"" hallway for my dog....tried the safety 1st gate that is $19.99 but turns out that one only works for areas that are perfectly even and do not have base moldings (would work for a door frame but not for my hallway). Also the cheaper one is plastic lattice which my dog would chew on...This one is PERFECT, but you can not see thru the plastic panels as stated in review. Very solid gate, when you press down the lock handle to set the gate up, it custom fits to the space. Definally worth the $30...I did get mine at toys r us though :)"
2,Disappointed,"At first we were thrilled with this gate. It worked well. One of them did have a problem by not locking into the correct position as we had to keep adjusting the length whenever we closed the gate but that was ok, we could live with that. Unfortunately, we cannot live with the gate just popping open on it's own. This started happening a few months after we bought the gate. We'd lock it and sometimes it would pop open (while the latch was still in the locked position - pushed down) while we were right there and other times it would open after we've left the area. I don't know why it is doing this now as nothing has changed from before - dimensions still the same, house has not shrunk or expanded... child is not big enough to cause any damage to it. We had bought 2 gates and they are both doing the same thing. So, we're on the hunt again for the perfect gate - if there is such a thing out there."
5,I LOVE THIS GATE!!!,We have 3 big dogs and this gate works perfectly to keep them in or out. I love that it is secured into the door frame and that it is so simple to open and close!!!
3,Not bad but mounts may break,"We purchased 2 of these when we had our son 18 months ago. One was an open box with no hardware which was fine for a while. But if used in a high traffic area it is much easier to use the hinge mounts. The mounts are made primarily from plastic. OUr top hinge cracked after the stress of toddler has been pulling on it for a couple months. Still holds but i don't think this would be a safe unit for the stairs. This works great as a pet door as well. We keep it about 8 inches off the floor which is low enough for our dog and child, but high enough for our cats to go under.Also the hand mechanism doesn't seem as smooth operating as it should be, the gears or whatever in one of them don't feel like they are really working right and i ahve to fuss with it a bit more to get it open.All in all an average gate for medium use."
1,DON'T BUY THIS GATE,Unless you like wasting money I would not buy this gate. It is made of a good material and looks nice but... the gears for the pressure locking mechanism inside are made of plastic and STRIP after not much use. It will hold for a few minutes then while you are away and think your child is safely secured you will hear it POP open. We ended up having to buy another style with a simpler design. Hope this helps.
4,Perfect for OLD houses,"My house was built in 1862 and I have struggled with several different gates trying to get one to fit my odd sized, crooked doorways. This gate (when hardware mounted) adjusts to fit my doorways where no other gate could. I agree that it's not easy to use, you have to readjust the size each time it's opened or closed, but for me it's worth it to have a gate that fits my crooked doorways. Also, the hardware mounted installation template that was included made it SUPER easy to install. I'm very happy with this gate."
1,"Don't rely on the picture, It's not that easy!","We mounted this gate on the doorway putting holes in our walls only to find out how terrible this product is. The door is flimsy and not very sturdy, it rocks back and forth. It's not that easy to open (as it is shown in the picture on the box). You kinda have to lift up on the handle and put your weight into the door to open. When you open the pressure settings on the side rock back and forth making it hard to close. This one is going back to the store, and now I will be busy repairing the holes in the wall. Disappointed!"
4,"A great, confusing game","Love this game, a good time waster, if one has the time to waste...only wish that the action would slow down a bit, all that running around so fast is confusing for an ""oldie"" like me."
2,Fun game but not stable,"This game is actually a lot of fun. However, the game keeps crashing from every 5 minutes to 2 hours. I can't figure out what's causing it and it is very very frustrating. I downloaded their latest driver and even tried run windows 98 compatible mode as they suggested, now the program won't even start. I finally removed it from my system. It's a shame because I was about to be hooked on this game. So, buyers! be aware. This program is full of bug. I can't believe they released beta version. That's why I love Blizzard games, they delay their release schedules on their new games just to make it sure it's ready for the release. FYI, I have Intel motherboard with Intel Pentium 4 1.3 GHz with 128MB of Rambus RAM; 40 GB EIDE hard drive and ATI RADEON All in Wonder. I am running on Windows XP Home edition with 3 full patches installed. My system is very stable. This game is the only game so far wouldn't run.From Southern Califonia gamer..."
5,THE PURSUIT OF PERFECTION !!!!,"Much improvement over civ II. Excelent graphics, excelent animation. Civilization is on whole differnet level of computer game. The people who gave this game less than 5 stars dont have a clue. This is the best simulation of real world country/culture interactions ever. You would have to be an actual world leader to have it more real. Oh and this game is highly addictive. So dont play if if you care about your GPA"
3,"If you got tired of other civs, altho great, ditto here","The three stars are for people who have played previous civs. If you've never played it, then five stars!Much nicer graphics, more subtle diplomacy, tough opponents, endless variety of worlds and foes, more automated units....much of the stuff that made the first two civs so neat and addictive are upgraded.But some of us stopped playing after we ""got the idea"" with two or three lengthy and very engrossing, but increasingly predictable (in terms of the basic process), games. I'm one of those. If you're the same way, Civ III might not even last that long for you. I got it with a gift certificate and a little extra cash, so I can't complain. I would have not wanted to pay full price, however."
2,I want my money back!!!,"This game was a huge disappointment. I pre-ordered this game and was very excited about the release of Civ III, but it's definately not all than it was made out to be. I would reccommend either Civ II or the new Age of Empires rather than this waste of money."
5,Civilized Civilization,"This game is amazing, the details are just endless. There is numerable amount of resources and weopons, such as chariots, catapults, and later in the game, tanks and naval ships. The ONE flaw that this game has is the larger your civilzation is, the longer it takes to complete one round of turns. When i played as France once, I got so far and had so many people on the map, it took five minutes to complete one turn so i stopped playing that level. Another thing is that no two maps are the same. It is an amazing game!"
1,Don't waste your money or time,"This game is inferior to Alpha Centauri in every way. In addition to step back from advances in AC, this game is just downright boring! Impossible to expand away from your central cities due to exagerated corruption - and to build the required city structures to set on growth path can take hundreds of years - no lie! Your central cities quickly build all improvement options and have nothing to do but build troops which are used to conquer lands which you have no ability to grow into. Trading is a joke. I can go on and on but don't want to. I feel cheated and the game makers don't seem to have a clue. This game is simply horrible."
1,Extremely irritating,"Why are Ironclads sinking my battleships and Knights taking out my tanks??? Have the game designers never opened a history book or something? This game is slow and extremely, painfully tedious, especially toward the end when you have to control upwards of 30 or 40 units, one at a time. It has a few interesting add ons, like mobilizing your civilization for war and strategic resources, but I just can't deal with my marines being slaughtered by muskets! Civ III is a huge step back from Alpha Centuri, where they specifically addressed and solved this BS. I highly recommend getting Alpha Centuri over this game."
1,Nothing but problems,"Beware, this game is a tech nightmare. I spent 6 hours trying to get my system back together after the havock unleashed by Civiliation 3."
2,Comes Down To The AI,HIThe truth is i want an AI that competes and doesn't cheat...Brian Reynolds was the true Brians at Firaxis obviously.Civ 3 has a pathetic AI that cheats on every level..The programming of Jeff Briggs and crew is pathetic.I'd love to see a new Alpha Centauri Or a civ 4 with great AI...Sigh.
1,Buy Civ1 or Civ2 NOT Civ3,"Hi,Civ3, pretty pictures; unplayable, ties up CD player,slooooooow, lousy contrast on screen, not worth $5,not worth shipping,"
2,Give me a break!,"I have played this game trying to find some positive aspects for it.Give me a break list:1. How can a spearman defeat my tank? I know there is some degree of imagination here....give me a break!2. Why can't I group the units into an army more easily? I have to move each unit one-by-one and then watch them move!! Give me a break!3. I can't tell other AI's to keep there distance from my cities, but everytime my scout passes by there worker i get nasty messages! Give me a break!4. Resources.... can i find some please?5. Espionage? Do you have 3000 gold ? Give me a break!Bottom line... maybe some civ2 fans might love the upgrade, but it would only seem good business to get some freash opinions on the game revamp. Please test the game before spending money!!"
5,A great game,This game is the greatest game i have ever played. I don't no why everybody doesn't rate this a five star game.
2,Dissapointment!,This game is a graphical enhancement of CIV II with much of the playability removed. It is slow and tiresome to play - and not particularly rewarding. Strategy gaming fans - pass on this one.
2,Can be fun.,"Pro's:- Tons of fun at the higher ages.- Requires good strategy and logical thinking skills.- Lets you rebuild history.Con's:- Takes a VERY long time to get to a higher age.- Imbalanced combat. Example: My military advisor told me to get archers because they're better than warriors; then when my archer engaged in combat with a warrior he was easily defeated by the warrior.- Half of the time you're going to be hitting spacebar to skip your turn.- No online/multiplay capabilites (unless you waste your money on an expansion).- Can't choose a starting age.- No campaign/story mode.- Can sometimes take way too long to finally finish a game.Final Verdict:The cons outnumber the pro's and even though this game can be quite fun at times, it has way too many major issues and if you want them fixed then you'll need to pay extra money for expansion packs."
2,"Good graphics, bad game","Excellent graphics provide real enjoyment, but unfortunately, the new features of trade and resources result in bad science. If this game were to be believed, the most advance culture will develop advanced technologies such as gunpowder without any access to saltpeter, therefore cannot have musketeers. How is that? Trade routes cannot be developed without constructing a road to the others capital. And if trade is purely based upon resources, then insufficient resources are available early in the game. The early Vikings traded heavily in furs and hardwood lumber and became some of the greatest controllers of trade in the Baltic in the 8-10 centuries. Worse, with the advantage of iron and technology, it is overly difficult to attack other civilizations. Does anyone want to buy a game?"
1,Laughable crap,"So this game costs 0,70 cents. Hah! I thought so. Who could buy a game in whichIt takes a century to train 1 spearman?It takes half a millenium to build a fort, and the enemy can just walk around it?Units can walk around other units, taking cities without even fighting even if they are surrounded by enemies on all sides?A caveman can destory a 21st century tank?This kind of crap makes me laugh. Get Victoria: an Empire under the Sun, Hearts of Iron II or Europa Universalis II. Search for them here in Amazon, to at least know what you are missing."
2,Civ3 is a big step back ...,"from Civ:Call To Power 2.1) It's not multiplayer2) The combat is back to that old ""one-at-a-time"" system.3) Units only reflected current tech, no futuristic stuff. Or lawyers, televangelists, etc.4) The AI players *still* cheat, but you can't cheat at all... in short, why did they bother ? Does Sid need the paycheck ?"
4,a great game,this is a great game in the Civilization series but it is not as good as Civilization 2.
2,"Not a Sequal, A re-release with New Graphics","I bought this thinking I'd find a new game, with new units, with some interesting changes from the previous two versions.Instead, I got Civilization that was released in the early 90s with new graphics.There is nothing new that I would justify this being called a sequal. This is simply a re-make of a great game. It's not worth the investment in the high price they are asking for this item."
1,"Very fun, but read the end of this review.","It's tremendous fun being a king. Now with improved trade, superb graphics and mind-bending strategy it's very cool! You can rewrite history with about 12 civilizations from the history books. Talk to major world leaders like Abe Lincoln, Joan of Arc, and Bismark. However there are many flaws too. If you retire or have a bad score, (It's almost impossible to get a good one) you see your picture with brusies and band-aids all over you. And they call you pathetic or even worthless. And if you want to be a world power, you have to look like a world power. For example if you want to be American, you have to look like Abe Lincoln. Kids would hate it. Bored adults and teens would not find it as offensive as younger kids. Overall, I think it's stupid!An offended ten year old boy,Joseph"
1,Its just plain boring,"I got this game for my birthday last year and I hate it. There are no battles, and all you do is sit there gazing at your city in a bird's eye view. Plus you take turns with your opponent, which is quite possibly the most ridiculous thing i have ever heard of since the making of the computer game Risk. I enjoy all the other cool games like starcraft, warcraft, and ages of empires, but this game is simply stupid. If you are considering making a puchase on it, don't. Youll throw it away once you play it."
1,this game is sick........,"This game is poor. i have civilation call the power, the game play isvery slow, this mode of game is very sick, because you can play allday and don't win or lost, you can play more days forwin?when the PC attack you, you can think with suficenttime what do.Games of strategy have to be in real time, in realtime you need have strategy to win, do you need stay prepared for allmovement of yours enemies.do you want thisgame?think this before buy."
3,Not my type of game,"A strategy game without decent battles are not my type of fun. Make no mistake, this is a great game, but I rather go for Medieval: Total War."
3,"No multiplayer support, but otherwise good","It's like previous CIV's, with better graphics and sound, and a lot of rules changes that are, for the most part, well thought out. If you've played previous CIVs, read the manual to get the changes, because some will significantly change your strategy.HOWEVER, it does not yet support multiplayer. If you like playing by yourself, buy the game. If you like multiplayer CIVs, then hang onto your CIV II Multiplayer for a while longer until CIV III Play the World becomes available.One bug I saw -- the ""establish an embassy button"" mentioned by but not pictured by the manual, which is supposed to appear once you have writing and contact with other nations, does not seem to exist."
3,AWESOME (with some flaws...),"Got this the day it came out. The store did not have the regular version in stock, so I bought the special addition. I have been looking forward to this for a LONG time, as I am sure many of you have been. I will glance over the positive first - game is great - more or less same as before - which is what everyone wants. BUT, the game crashed on me once so far. It is also VERY slow, and I have a very fine machine (P4, 1.4MHz, etc.). These two quirks, sadly, upset me, and I think that others should be made aware of them. Perhaps a fix will come out over the next few months. The game is great, as shoudl be expected, but perhaps some more QA time should have been applied."
2,Not as good as Civilization II,"Civ III is much anticipated and I would say quite disapointing. Civ II had a number of unballanced aspects (howitzers that won ever engagement and railroads that allowed instant transport to name a few). However, it was a good simulation of cultural development. Civ III lacks many of the key technological improvements of Civ II (no rail so you always use the same roads that you built in 3000 BC and no improvments in agriculture) that makes the game less fun. They should have made the game more ballanced but still kept the flow of history that made it great before."
1,BIGGEST DISSAPOINTMENT OF THE YEAR!,I enjoyed both CivI and CivII. I fell that Civ III on the other hand is not well developed. In the older games I liked the units politcis econemy and the scenarios. Civ III has no real improvements save for grafics. It is a slow a boring game and I would reccomend to everyone DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!
2,Civilization 3 used price is higher than in the stores new,For the most part this game is boring as is a couple other simular games.i.e.Pharaoh/etc. I guess I like creating things that I have control over and therefore Roller Coaster Tycoon has been something I have throughly enjoyed. For interaction I think Black and White is great/creative.
2,Not That Great,"As another reviewer stated, sort of a blend of The Postman Always Rings Twice/Double Indemnity type story - hero immediately falls in love with and wants to marry murderous woman. Does her bidding, regrets it, ridiculous ending. I mean, do people really abandon their moral code that quickly and easily? I don't believe so, therefore the whole premise seemed outlandish."
3,"Disappointing, not comprehensive","As a novelist, I was looking for a wider variety of forensics case studies. This book is very narrow in scope. It's readable and understandable, and does cover the basics, but it's of little use to me."
1,I can't belive this book was even published!,"I agree with what everyone elese had said, the book was horrible. She got many, many facts wrong, and the poor editing made this book almost impossible to read. If you want to learn about the mormon battalion, I would suggest reading the book by Daniel Tyler."
5,Excellent and practical,I use this book as both a pastor and theology instructor in a seminary. It is amazingly practical. Not from a classic Pentecostal viewpoint but that's not an issue.
5,A Valiant Effort that Prompts Repeated Listening!,"Jazz comes in All Shapes, Sizes and Colors. This Release stretches to embrace them all without losing the band's fresh originality and focus. The Crisp Snap of Jere B Beats, Jim Couchenour's sprinting melodies & The thump of Phil The Beat's bass wrapped around Paul Doud's fiery guitar and Keith McKelley's lilting saxophone make for a listening experience that prompts repeated listening again and again!"
4,Tropical!!!,"Positive: Sexuals of mango, banana, honey dew etc... It'll make your man groooaaa...Negative: It's not for kids!!! It may be too strong for certain sections!"
4,buen producto,"el producto llego con el tiempo que se informo al momento de la compra, son personas responsables, ademas tiene un olor agradable"
1,Inept,"Without a doubt, in the BOTTOM ONE PERCENT of any novel I have ever read. The beginning of the downhill slide of Janowitz's premature and now-forgotten fame, the point where she began embarrassing those who overpraised Slaves of New York. Her one idea, grand satire of irresponsibility, is relentless here, the sentences plodding, the character motivations cartoony. A must-read for up-and-coming writers who need the ""I-can-do-better-than this!!"" push. Pretentious, unimaginative, and awful."
3,Fine for what I need it for,Got it to hook up to an intercom. Very small and good for that. I wouldn't use it to make actual phone calls though...
1,Umm.. the review is off a bit.,"The whole premise of the GBA SP is that it doesn't have batteries! It's a rechargable unit. You can buy this, but I can only think of a few times where it may come in useful. The GBA SP has a battery life of approx. 8-10 hours with the light on, and 18-20 with it off. Now if you're going on a long car ride with children and they aren't going to shut it off all the way there, or you won't be stopping at a hotel, I could see purchasing this. I can't find any other reason to buy it though."
2,Old fashoin like grandma had better,"This is obviously designed to hold in one hand and the fruit (I'm juicing lemons) in the other. The comfortable position is horizontal, however, that doesn't let gravity help so much, so there is a little juice left inside the lemon. If you turn it up vertical you can get the rest of the juice out and it runs down your hand. The seeds pretty much stay in the splines and you can get them out with a knife, but I think it's easier on the old fashion juicer grandma had. I'm going back to the old style that's been around forever."
1,never again!!,I would never order from this company or this item i received it in the mail and it was only one sled NOT a 24 pack. I paid $20.95 to ship a 22 pound item and what a i got was one plastic sled that weighed 3 pounds this whole add is a lie and i would never order from them again. I have written e-mails and called multiple times with no response. This was going to be a christmas gift I hope they feel awful doing this to people but i am sure they don't.
1,"Bad, bad, bad!","I can't think of any redeeming qualities to this CD, other than the appreciation of the quiet when it is over! What a good voice to be wasted on such drivel!"
4,Acquired Taste,"Carly has never been a casual listener's pleasure, sure there have been a few very commercial songs that she has done, most of The Bedroom Tapes do not fit the commercial aspect and is not meant for someone who is unwilling to really listen to what the layers of music are about. These songs, like most of Carly's work, are very complex and require attention. This album can't be played once, it has to be played over and over again to un-layer all the textures. Once that is done this album is brillant. Listen to the textures, lyrics, and the haunting music. This is by far Carly at her best. So, my advice is to buy this CD, play it several times and fall in love with the comfort of a great and very unique artist. If you are a music fan you will be delighted by how Carly has not bowed to the norm and predictable. Hey she is offering you something here, and it is not popcorn music... Take it. Enjoy it."
5,I love my mom's music,"I think this is some of the best music I've ever heard in my life. Of course it doesn't hurt that my beautiful, glorious mommy made it. But seriously, check it out. This is the stuff that dreams are made of!!!"
5,the beging,Not really a basics but a great book though.It has really good out lines for character drawings and is the beging of the rest of this fab series.
3,good beach book,"Gutcheon's book began with such promise, i.e. the coming together of five emotionally scarred women, but ended up as pretty predictable fare. It's easy to read and would make a great beach book, but I was hoping that there would be more emotions and feelings to explore, rather than trite girl beats guy and everyone lives happily ever after."
3,A Good Summer Fluff Read,"This was a good book to sandwich in between some other heavy duty reading I've been doing. It was enjoyable mind-candy -- the characters are fun and likeable. I vicariously enjoyed their stay at the Fat Farm -- wishing I could have been there with them. Yes, it is a predictable story line, but, sometimes, you just need to know that there will be a happy ending. Take a break from Oprah and have some fun."
4,A slice of fat-free adventures richly iced by five lives.,"Five Fortunes is a great read. Gutcheon lets you eavesdrop in wonderful situations among the very best company-- with a few lowlifes thrown in for good measure. Her plot is a pin ball rocketing around from hazard to hazard--a fat farm, the White House even widowhood-- as her heroines involve you in their romances and their politics, family dynamics, searches for self-esteem and a smaller dress-size. Five Fortunes is a who-dunnit, a boy gets girl, even a modern parable. The conversations are bang on and Gutcheon's dry wit is a pleasure to savor as private jets and jalopies careen through the skies and along our cities' streets, and separate lives intertwine to pull off a team victory."
2,Cartier meets Fossil,"There is no shortage of praise for this watch. And that is the problem. This is a mass advertised watch unlike other Cartiers of the past. The result? Any status conscious person with a job is buying one and making this Cartier a common sight. One of the things that makes Cartier watches special, besides the understated elegance is that they are less ubiquitous than Rolex. Not anymore. Also, this model is a little too bulky looking for my taste in a Cartier; Breitling and Rolex maybe, Cartier, no."
5,Very Satisfied,This takes scrapbooking to another level. I've tried some of the techniques already. I love it.
3,Cutting Edge Photo Cropping for Scrapbooks,"Seemed a little difficult and not quite what I was looking for. However, it does have a great ideas for someone who has a lot of time on their hands."
4,very nice tea at a great discount from Twinings,I really like this tea. At times I blend it with other teas like orange or peach. Buying it from Amazon through subscribe and save instead of from Twinings saves just about $20.00. Now that is a lot of bread. all-in-all a very nice tea with strong flavor made better by such a great price.
5,English Breakfast,"This is the only English Breakfast tea on the market that earns its name.. It is full bodied, rich, and flavorful. Earl Grey tastes like perfume and the majority of others are thin and lack the depth this has. Have no fear, drink here."
2,The worst English Breakfast tea I have tried,No character or defined traits as in any other English Breakfast I've had. I prefer the ones that are made with Chinese blends. I'll drink it when I'm out of stock of any other tea.
4,Pleasant.,"Completely different story than the book by Louisa May Alcott.It is not a great movie, but I enjoyed it. The school is quaint, on a farm. The story is really about a boy's father, a struggling and charming swindler, in the likes of Long John Silver, searching for new schemes to swindle money. His son, who goes off to school, is a bit embarrassed by his father's career. Nothing exceptional, but pleasant, and keeps your interest.The father advertises in the newspaper: ""Send $3 and receive a fine quality portrait of President Washington, by a professional artist, with exquisite detail""."
1,Little Men (1940),"I thought this movie was an absolute failure in almost all aspects! The actors were horrible (except Kay Francis as Jo Bhaer). Fritz was displayed as a naive, Swiss professor--almost completly stupid--now why would you marry someone like that? And Dan was a horrible crybaby! I was very disappointed in this movie and I would not recommend it to anyone."
3,Where is Laura Nyro?,"Laura's music gave the film so much in the way of soul, hard to believe it's missing here. Hmmm...anyway, I'd still recommend the film and soundtrack!"
2,WHAT? NO LAURA NYRO?,HUH? Laura Nyro is clearly a part of the film's dialogue and sets the mood for integral scenes. I'm glad I knew that her songs had not been included--it saved me some hard earned bucks!
4,Best unit for price,"I have had no problems with this receiver. Though set-up and instructions can be a little confusing. All-in-all, there isn't anything on the market in the same price range with the full range of features this receiver has."
3,Just okay,there are too many of her slow jams missing from this compilation. While the songs on here are excellent some wouldn't have been the chosen by me to make up this CD
5,Love Songs,"This CD compilation was missing from my Teena Marie collection so I had to get it even though I have the songs on different CDs, all my favorites are here on this one CD."
2,Drive Failure after 6 Months,"This has been a great drive until it failed. I use the Maxtor strictly to back up my system each evening. After several months I noticd an occasional loud grinding noise coming from the drive. Eventually it made the grinding noise all the time - sounded like an electric pencil sharpener. Anyway, I informed Mxtor/Seagate. Their warranty records were good. They offer an option where for $20 they send a replacement drive to me and I can send my old drive back in the same shipping container. It has taken a couple weks for a replacement drive to come in stock. I just received word today my replacement is on its way. It's een frustrating having to wait so long to back up my system. Fortunately,because it's a backup, data loss is not an issue for me. I hope this review helps you make a decision."
1,Failed...TWICE,"I bought this to use with my macbook pro to do some video editing. Within a month, the hard drive failed and I had to get a warranty-covered replacement. I have hardly used the drive in the past 3 years and it failed again and this time I lost all my family videos that still needed to be edited and burned to a DVD. The failure rate when considering how much I used the drive is disgraceful. I would not buy this same drive again and it will take A LOT to convince me to ever buy a Seagate/Maxtor drive again."
4,Works pretty well and is quite fast,"This external HD is really good, just a squeemish below five stars. Easy to setup and easy to use. Although I don't use its own software to make my back ups, using it as a regular pen-like flash drive is superb. Just turn it on, plug the firewire and drag and drop your data to have it safe. Also, it's portable, another plus!"
5,Excellent investment,"I picked up this hard drive recently and I must say it has been a great investment. For the money I spent on it I definitely got my money's worth. It's quiet, fast, and outperforms my current HD beautifully. I cannot recommend it enough. I shopped around considerably before settling on the Barracuda, and I must say it has paid off!"
3,Deadweight REVIEW,This book seems to be very informative. The only problem i had is that it was not in NEW condition as stated. However the books information is laid out easy to understand and thorough for the subject matter. I have enjoyed the stories that kind of break up the book as well. Overall I would recommend this book to others.
1,WAY Too Small,"A year or so ago, I bought several of these on sale. They are poorly sized (I have 4XT), far too tight for a big man like me to wear comfortably. Maybe you could order several sizes too big to get a good fit, but unless you want everyone to see every roll of fat, I'd avoid buying these."
2,A real disappointment,"I was terribly disappointed in this book. I've been quilting for approximately twelve years now, and I had waited eagerly for it's arrival. All I can say is don't waste your money. I felt it was lackluster in it's presentation style and boring. If you truely enjoy quilting in the primitive style, you will be disappointed in this book. If you are new to quilting altogether this book will leave you feeling as though something was missing."
5,"The best use of scraps, ever.",An innovative book for quilt and animal lovers. Loved the use of varied fabrics and the fact that it is so free form. I have a lot of scrap fabric that I simply can not part with. Now I can use them creatively. This was a library book that I kept renewing. Decided I just needed to buy it. Thanks.
1,"Never received item at all, instead received an Underarmor Back pack.","I can't review the Apple Wireless Pro Mouse as I NEVER received, nor did I receive an answer to my email. I am still holding the Under Armor Back Pack which obviously was supposed to go to someone else, but I can't help that person as I have no idea who they are.Satisfied, NO I AM NOT SATISFIED! I really wanted and needed the mouse. I won't order again. Thank you."
1,american idol's hunchback,"The idea behind the american idol doll is great... but it really doesn't have an everflex body.. the arms and legs are everflex and skinny like a string bean not realistic looking, but the worst part is the fact that the entire torso and neck is made of hard plastic, and it is stuck in that strange bent over position.... not by accident, they did this on purpose, she can't wear reg barbie clothes, she's too skinny, and her body is crooked, she cant ride in barbie cars because her legs are too long, and she doesn't sit up staight. my daughter actually started crying because the doll was crooked... she thought it was going to work like the cheerleader dolls with the everflex body... the product really is a waste.... you can't play with it ..."
2,How am I supposed to move?,"Tori needs some serious help. Why they chose to make the doll permanently bent in an awkward position, I'll never know. Despite this fact, my daughter still loves her. Tori is hard to dress, which frustrates my daughter and requires my assistance every time.If I had known all of this, I would have bought her a more traditional Barbie."
4,it works good,"i bought to connect two gameboys, and that's what it did. It works and has not caused any problems. It's at a good price too."
5,BETTER than SOUTHPARK and Celebrity Deathmatch,"Eminem did it again! Yeah, he produced some dope,cool cartoon,of his alter ego Slim Shady.Slim and his homies are beating up Celebrities and are doing a lotta [stuff] on this dvd. You can also see Marshall,Eminem,the gay-guy KEN KANIFF (from Eminems CD's),BIG D (that's like the big bully) DAVE ... and Southpark,NSync,Aguilera,George Michael,Ben Affleck,Olsentwins and lot more.If you like Eminem,you'll love this DVD,I can watch it over n over again.Many Characters are spoken by Marshall Mathers. It's really funny,it's worth it,I swear by my mom =o)"
3,Good Collector's,"I used to own this and am an avid Eminem fan so I had to own it! However, I will admit that it's not the most hilarious thing I've ever seen. I still love him tho!!!"
4,Include all the movies BUT...,"I was very exited about having the omen collection , eveything was great when it arrived BUT, the Bluray case is in a cheap cartoon , The whole thing that contains the blurays is made with a thin cartoon, this is awful thanks God I bought it when it was in promotion."
2,"Poorly staged, boring, slow, and overly contrived","This concert was apparently just a stunt. It has all the feeling of being assembled to please the performers, not the audience. The false Hollywood feel between the performers, the shortness of the show, the waste of talent, and the meandering pace all detract. The stage is too wide and poorly used, and it's like this was all done to give everybody some work. A big disappointment. McDonald's voice and ability to entertain are not in question. This DVD detracts."
4,GOOD SUSPENSE!,"Good romantic suspense about a blind cop and his rehab counselor who happens to have been ""plain Jane"" in high school who had a crush on him. They both learn to live in a different life than what they had planned."
2,"Great nib, poor body construction; a good starter pen","This pen made me feel like one of the forefathers. Sadly, it only lasted about a week before it broke. Here are some details:Pros:Lightweight, thanks to the aluminum body; very modernNib looks great and ink flows really wellA good size, even for small handsCons:So lightweight, it actually feels cheapUnder the aluminum is a poorly constructed casing; my pen broke in half after one week of useThis is a great pen if you've just started to explore the greatness of fountain pens. But with fountain pens, more than anything, you really do get what you pay for. Most of the reviews for this pen are stellar, so chances are I had some bad luck and ended up with one that happened to break."
4,"It was Good, But not the Best!!!","The 3rd sequel to the series ""Not quite Human"".Chip Carson, is android who was built by his scientist father.After his father gives a speech, he is kidnapped and tortured by a company who wants his secret to building androids.Chip finds out about his father getting kidnapped and that his father was replaced by a clone.With the help of Chip's new friend, they must hurry and stop this evil company.2 other sequels were made before this, ""Not Quite Human"" (1987) and ""Not Quite Human 2"" (1989).Both are Out-of-Print.I hope you enjoy this movie as much as I do!Enjoy!!!"
2,"Good Movie, Overrated ending.","If you like character studies then this is your type of movie. It provided a lot of interesting mood swings, and even the red herrings tossed our way are interesting. The acting is great as is typical of European cinema.But...I was so hyped up for the ""masterful"" ending and was sorely disappointed. I wouldn't call it ""Hitchcockian"" as much as I would ""Rod Serlingian"". It's a gruesome ending, but nothing you wouldn't see in a C-grade horror flick."
4,Just the facts,"As an historian (and ex-Mormon), I found Charles M. Larson's work well researched, and reasonably well written. Some of the chapters (9 and 10) might have been ""tighter,"" but this a critic of style, not over-all method. While Larson clearly demonstrates that J. Smith faked the Book of Joseph, he does lesser job in speculating ""why."". Larson shines, with the letters from T. S. Ferguson as particularly powerful evidence. However, Larson might have left the appeal to ""Bible believing"" Christianity out of the work. Is the work an expose of Smith's fraud, or a long, and not so direct, evangelical tract?"
5,I love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This is great and works wonderfully. My 3 year old granddaughter was sent home from school with a temp. I had no problem taking her temp with this and checking to see if it went down after her meds. She never fussed or minded me using it either. Her mom has the one that you rub over the forehead and I can never get that one to work properly. This one is terrific.
3,Not very accurate for infants,I was a ped nurse not too long before i became a mom and it is not recommened that you use these thermometers on infants. But I must say that the ear thermometers used in the hospital seemed a lot more accurate that this particular one. It is all abt technique and even someone like me still has trouble with it. My husband and I used it one ourselves and got temperatures off by a degree with several reads! It is probably more user error than a fault in the thermometer. I still think a rectal temperature is the most accurate on an infant.
2,Batteries die to often,"We only had this thermometer a few weeks when the battery went out and I haven't been able to find a replacement battery so I haven't used it since. Overall, I would not recommend this."
2,Not the most accurate thermometer,FYI...my baby was delivered at 35 weeks causing a stay in the neonatal icu. I was considering purchasing this thermometer before our arrival until I asked a couple of nurses if it was better than the under the arm thermometer that they use. they use the under the arm because it is the most accurate reading. The ear readings can be very inconsistent according to different factors such as which ear they use and position of the ear and lack of steady contact. I will be using the under the arm when my girl gets home. just wanted to pass the info along.
2,Breaks easy and not accurate,After purchasing three (call me a slow learner) of these products - and having all of them break - I would not recommend it. The ear piece is temperamental and provides inaccurate readings. Not being able to get an accurate reading when you have a sick child is worse than not having a thermometer! Continually putting a new covering on the ear piece every time you use it is a hassle too. Save yourself the hassle and buy the fever strip stickers or temporal thermometers!
1,not very reliable,"The read from this thermometer is always different from thetraditional thermometer. The problem is that the differenceis not consistent, swing from 0.3-1.0 F."
1,Ever-warped body,"My daughter wanted this rather expensive Barbie primarily because it said on the back ""Ever-flex body"" and showed the doll with the waist bent. She and I assumed that Ever-flex meant flexible. Given the bizarre angle shown, it never occured to us that anyone would sell a doll locked permanently in such a strange stance.We would not have purchased this doll, even at half the price, if their packaging had been honest. 'Ever-flex' means that the waist will never, never flex. It's locked that way forever.On the other hand, my daughter likes the clothes, and maybe she'll have fun with the karaoke machine. This might be worth buying once it goes on sale, but keep in mind that you'll be stuck with a permanently weird-looking doll that will never stand or sit straight. If the makers of this doll believe that there's a market for that, then they should have been honest about it on the packaging."
1,I'm not that innocent!,"Why would parents want their 3 to 10 years old (more like 3 to 7, really) singing the lyric ""I'm not that innocent!"" (lyric from the song Barbie sings)? I don't want my daughter walking around singing that!"
1,ewwwwwwwwwwwww!!,ewwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww!!! What an ugly doll! ewwwwwwwwwwwwwww!!! She's soo tall like some freekish tall anorexia freek. She is not flexible at all! And the song is soooooooooooo old!!
4,The Lincoln Lords by Cameron Hawley,"Written with the same narrative skill that made 'Executive Suite' and 'Cash McCall' such wonderfully readable books, Cameron Hawley now achieves the full dimension of a truely major work. This is a truly rewarding novel, a book that no perceptive reader will soon forget."
5,the unwanted,Morgan is a blood witch. She was adopted. Morgan's life has been changing and is changeing still. THen Hunter another blood witch enters her life. From the very first moment she saw him she disliked him but now she absolutely hates him. Hunter is saying things about Cal that hurt her. Then things take a turn for the worst and Morgan is to blame. What did she do? Read this book and find out!
3,Ehhh...,"This stroller is not what I had expected. For me it is easy to fold and unfold, the hard part is maneuvering it. The wheels don't straighten out on tile floor and sometimes the handle part pops out ! I love how small it folds though. It's a win lose for me."
3,"Problems with ""hide number"" in caller id","Overall no major problems with the phone. Some difficulties with sound quality, but I don't know if it's phone vs. Cinguular.One major glitch is inability to switch into ""hide number"" in caller ID. When you do that, the phone stops dialing out after an hour or so. I thought it was a problem with a particular hand set, got a new one and same thing happens.Will have to exchange it, since I like to keep my number private"
3,very large diameter,"The large diameter of these makes it difficult to use for anything but the thickest of cookies, and it also affects their shape. works best if inserted after baking."
4,Summer Infant Fold N store Tub Time Bath Sling,This product made it a lot easier to bathe my newborn. Great Quality and easy to use. Good Quality product works great.
2,PF 100 great gadget. ...Poor software,"The PF-100 is a great gadget for checking a few values that can indicate general lung health -> Asthma. Its easy to use, inexpensive, light weight. For a stand alone device it works great as a spot check.Software? Toss it. It looks like it should work great for managing the data recorded. But it locks up on WinXP and is pretty much worthless as you cant get the data from the device. Attempts to resolve this with Microlife were not productive as they stated "" we have not heard of this problem"". I Find it hard to believe. This is most likely due to support for Win98 as indicated. Who still uses this Win98? Its 2007."
3,Save your money,There is so much variability in the readings that it's more likely indicating your technique in the blow than your condition that day.
1,1 of 2 did not work,"I purchased 2 of these meters. One of the two did not work properly. The readings were over 100 points higher than my mechanical meter. I kept getting a new ""HI"" reading just about each time I took readings. During an attack, I took my readings, and received a new ""HI""(reading over 685). I then used my mechanical meter, and found I was in the red zone (actual reading 370).The second meter I purchased is for my son, his 'appears' to be working properly. I will monitor this closely. As far as I am concerned, this meter is a piece of garbage."
1,Software inoperative on either Windows Xp or 8,"Ordered this version for the computer SW tracking feature. However, the SW cannot install on windows 8 (it only yields an error message) and my Windows XP machine cannot even recognize the disk (yes the drive is working).So, I'll have to return as defective. I like the device, but really wanted tracking function to use in conjunction with a Lung Training device because I have poor lung function. PS there is NO SW patch or drivers to download from the MicroLife website. They seem not to support this product."
5,I highly recommend the Microlife PF 100 Peak Flow Meter,The peak flow meter is easy to use. It is also of very high quality. The traffic light color code system makes it easy to know when your in trouble.
5,More than Excellent,"I read all of the Instinct Series a long time ago and still have the books. Now I have started to read them all over again on my Kindle Fire and they are just as good. If you like this type of Genre, don't miss out on reading a really great series."
2,Killer Instinct,"I had a really hard time getting into this book. I think there were too much information that went off on a tangent. This made it it a little tedious to follow. I am not sure I would read the other books in this series for that reason alone. Sorry, but I don't recommend this book for a good read....maybe last resort."
3,"Some of his ""facts"" are pure fantasy.","I've read all of Patricia Cornwell, and have just about OD'd on Ridley Pearson, and this was an Amazon suggestion. While it was a decent read, I found two major problems by page 37. First of all, what Medical Examiner would be out in the middle of nowhere conducing a scene investigation in a skirt and high heels? Sexist, if you ask me. Secondly, he paints the ""small town medical examiner"" as some sort of villain and says HE will embalm the victim. Having both funeral directors and medical examiners in my family, I know that no ME will embalm a body...and you do not need an MD for embalming. It was a decent read, but some of his descriptions and action scenes get a little drawn out. I found myself skimming some parts. I may try another Coran novel, but it won't be my first choice."
3,Satisfactory,"Although I loved the video, honestly I must say that I wanted to see more of the Zoomer in Wonderland and The Cat Came Back, more of the games and finally where are they are now. It was nice to see the kids though it brought back a lot of childhood memories for me. I was a major Zoom fan."
4,French Special Forces!!!!,So cool to see the Special Forces of other countries in a movie. It's usually just the special units of the US and many times a little hard to believe. Great action scenes and realistic for today as far as I know. Not that I've seen action in a few years. As far as crossing frozen mountains with no specialized gear...........it's a movie. If I'd wanted a mountain climbing documentary I'd have watched one. I wanted action and drama.
5,The Shore -- Absolutely awesome,I heard tracks from this release several months ago on the airline audio on a business trip. I've been waiting anxiously for the CD release and now it's finally here. Go get it. It's some of the most refreshing rock I've heard in years.
4,Inexpensive and easy way to make a cappuccino,"The quality is just 'ok' as it is made in India rather than Italy and you can easily see it when you unpack it. The handle feels a bit cheap, the lid also looks like it could break if you ain't careful and the metal also has some defects.But for the price it is rather excellent at what it does, which are espressos. You just fill it up with water, add you favorite coffee and in less than 5 minutes you are done!If you do it properly the espresso it produces is great and you save quite a bit of money by avoiding the expensive options. And since I'm using it only for my personal morning and evening cups of cappuccino I don't see the point on spending $300 to $400 dollars on a big machine.You are better of using that money on getting a high quality grinder, gourment coffee grains and some very nice Italian coffee cups or glasses."
3,espresso pot,"It was as it was advertised, I am just not happy with the pot as it gets a rusty residue and I thought it was suppose to be stainless steel, I didn't think stainless did that...?"
3,"Pretty good but made in India, not Italy!","I feel a little duped by Amazon with this one. It says the product is made in Italy but when I received it, the box said it was made in India. It bothers me that I paid extra for an Italian-made espresso machine, only to get one that is not authentic Italian at all. I'm sure it is just oversight on Amazon's part, however, because this is really the first problem I've had with them.The product works well enough. I was able to use it after about 20 minutes of washing out the rust and grease which were really hard to remove. Also, there were no instructions on how to use the product in the box.** UPDATE 10/24/08 - sending back because the coffee has started to take on a strange chemical taste that no amount of washing will get rid of. Not sure if it is coming from the rubber seal or the other metals in the device. I switched espresso and only use pure, filtered water so I can't see how it is anything but the pot itself."
1,Is the handle supposed to fall off mid-pour??,"I've been using this for about 5 months and was very happy with it, and then one day the handle just came unattached from the pot while I was pouring coffee! I was checking the reviews to see if this happened to any one else.... Makes me a little nervous about buying another..."
1,Worst production- Don't waste your money,It's probably the worst Penthouse video ever made. It seems like Penthouse hardly has any money to pay for some decent models... Besides photography is awful. It doesn't deserve any star.
1,Misleading Title,"Very misleading title. This book is about teleoperated robotics. If you are looking for information on remote controlled robotics, this book is not likely to help."
5,Jesus would like this one,"Martin Simpson takes American Gospel songs and gives them a wonderful blues twist. Mark Twain said one of the things he wouldn't like about heaven was the angel choirs. This is no angel choir. This is gospel a la mid-western praries, truckers, small cafes and bars, rough edges. God on a slide guitar. Well worth the listen."
5,Martin is an all time favorite,"This is possibly my #1 favorite CD of all times. If you like guitar music, you will love Martin's interpretations of these spiritual tunes. He is a true genius at his art."
2,Too Scary for Toddlers,"My 16 month old LOVES Elmo and Sesame Street so I was very surprised at his reaction to this DVD. When the Big Bad Wolf blew away Prairie Dawn and the camera, he started screaming and crying and climbing all over me (like the wolf was ""getting him""). I try to remember to fast-forward past this part but sometimes forget. He knows the scene is coming several scenes before and climbs in my lap for protection. This comes from a child who has NEVER been frightened by anything on TV.Also, my 2 1/2 year old neice was afraid of the very scary tornado in the weather segment. This DVD may be appropriate for older childrn, but definitely not for toddlers."
1,Worst copy ever,"This is an outrage - these people dare commercialize such an awful copy of the film, which is supposed to look beautiful (strong pictorial influences on the director, Andrzej Wajda) in a shameful, washed-out, second (if not third) generation copy. As if this were not enough, there are drops on the tape! The sound quality is mediocre, too. I've seen 'Brzezina' on TV and in a theatre before, so I know what it's supposed to look like - nothing like this nightmare. I regret having purchased anything from PolArt, and if their DVDs are the same quality, then I will have lost about $100 for no good reason..."
5,"easy to install, working fine","The software and instructions that came with this drive made it easy to install. Open the case (for my ancient Dell, this was the hardest part), switch wires to new hard drive, put in a few screws to hold it in place, close case. Pretty much that easy. Seems to be working fine after about 2 weeks."
5,amazing,"Being the hard core grunge fan that I am I absolutley love this video. It helped me gain more knowledge of some of my favorite bands. I've always been intrested in the seattle music scene and this was just a tool to help me learn more. If you like this check out ""the sound and the fury"" a good book on the seattle music scene."
4,Hype was excellent...,"I was *very* impressed with this film. I had already seen Doug Pray's ""Scratch"" documentary, and felt the need to work my way back from there. I spent the latter part of my adolescense and most of college in the midst of the grunge ""revolution,"" wholly unaware of its true musical origins in the pacific northwest (I'm speaking of the original bands themselves, not demographically). My only complaint with this film is that it wasn't long enough, and Doug definitely seemed to side with those who felt the ""scene"" had been compromised...but it seems to me that the owners of Sub Pop are the ones who made that determination. The majors just capitalized on their decision to ""go commercial"" -"
3,history of keyboard,Very expensive book which could really use some pictures. It would be helpful to see the early clavichord/harpsichord design. Also a picture of one from a museum which shows the decoration. Drawings of the composers would be nice.
5,"Not all ""Ladys"" are perfect in historicals...","Another winner from James. This is the follow up to Duchess in love, which I admit I had a hard time finishing but this one is much better, and like her previous trilogy.Lady Henrietta has a limp and a weak hip which she is lead to believe means she can not have children and there fore shall never be able to get married. Nut, she longs for children. Enter Simon Darcy and his step sisters. But, wait there is also a twist with love letter and a few scheming friends.I love how she puts Simons close friend Rees in his place and actually makes the wife hater defend her."
4,A very satisfying romance,"I loved Henrietta! She is not the cliche ""feisty"" heroine who is constantly contrary and angry and rash. She is strong-willed, but not stubborn. She knows herself, she's smart, and she's honest. No silly misunderstandings that last the whole book because the heroine can't tell the hero how she feels.Simon didn't fall into a simple mold either. I would have liked to know more about his feelings towards his late Uncle, his Aunt, and his step-sisters. But the important thing was that I knew exactly how he was feeling about Henrietta, and so did she because he showed her and told her.Esme and Sebastian's story is compelling (although not complete in this book). In all, this book manages to be fun and witty, and also portray deeper feelings authentically. It will stay in my library!"
4,This is a load of fun,"Everyone loves this. I was frustrated with it at first but discovered that I didn't put enough air in it. That is the key: put in as much PSI of air as you can. If it's too low, water gets in between the nylon cover bag and the air bladder and then it rides too low in the water to ride. In order to get it to spin, the riders must counterbalance their weight as best they can. For instance, if you have 4 riders that all weigh 70 lbs, it will spin with no problem. If you have 2 riders that weigh 60 lbs and 2 that weigh 80 lbs, as long as they ride across from each other, it will spin with no problem. If you have riders that weigh 50, 60, 70 & 80 lbs, they will have to do some weight shifting to get it to spin. Even if you can't get it to spin, it is great fun.Even while your boat is tied off at a dock or on a beach, the kids love to play on it and dive from it.Make sure you get the biggest beefiest tow rope you can find."
3,Not for Beginners !,"Not for the average user. Hard aluminum wheels can recall harshly. Real people will never use its highest end performance. Unforgiving of any accidental impacts, floor, wall, any body parts! All that being said, it is great fun and makes a HUGE impression on any audience as it sleeps far longer than any other super yo-yo I have used, long enough for 5-10 good tricks and a smooth recovery."
1,Junk!,This timer keeps on losing time and can't seem turn on the lights! I own other Intermatic timers but this one was crap right out of the box. Intermatic's products have a real quality problem I've also encountered lights that don't work out of the box- even with bulb changes.Keep your receipts!
1,What I Leared About Shooting at the Police Avademy,"The contents of this book are largely lifted from Police training manuals, and are not suited for the average citizen, unless you happen to be in a militia or you are a member of Al-Queda. I can't imagine why ordinary gun-enthusiasts would be interested in combat with fellow citizens, clearing and entering houses with hostile foes, and all the other techniques on offer here. Suarez makes a big deal about how he is a decorated officer, but no police officer worth their salt would put out books teaching citizens to be members of a tactical SWAT team.The author obviously isn't a police officer in good standing anymore because no commanding officer would permit someone to profit off the tactics presented here.If you are a gun-enthusiast, you would be better off buying something by John Farnam or Andy Stanford. Their books are written for citizen gun owners, and they don't teach how to indiscriminately kill people."
3,Did not fit a vintage Schwinn World Sport,"Got this to replace worn parts on a vintage Schwinn world sport. The cups did not fit in the frame. They a couple of mm's too big. The product description just says fit older American bikes. I guess I'd give the product an OK rating. there didn't appear to be anything wrong with it. But Niagara cycle works could stand to update the product description, maybe provide some actual measurements. Yeah, that would be nice."
2,Good while it lasted,"Bought this drive primarily for the 5 yr warranty. For the 2 years it was in service, drive was error free and operated relatively noise free. Disk died on me around the 2nd anniversary. Sent to Seagate for data recovery. Balked at the estimate of $1500. Most data recovery efforts will void the warranty anyway. In future, i will be more focussed on taking backups, and paying less attention to the warranty details."
3,Works but had issues,Right off I will tell you I'm partial to WD Drives.I bought this for an old computer I was giving to my son.This drive worked for about 50 days then sounded squeaky.I bought this based upon price.I then bought a WD Drive to replace this drive.It wasn't worth sending it back to segate to me.
5,Healthy Dog Food,"This dog food is not only healthy, but my dog loves it. She transitioned to this food with no problems at all. I definitely would recommend this selection to others."
5,solid debut,I enjoyed reading what I hope to be the first of many Kaluzny novels. He combines wit and intrigue marvelously throughout the story. I felt like I actually knew Randall by the end of the journey. Kaluzny displays the tools necessary to become one of our generation's great literary voices.
5,A must read!!!,"I absolutely loved this book. It is a book that anyone (male or female) can relate to. If you are single or ever have been, than you can find yourself somewhere in this book. Once I started reading, I could not put it down until I finished it. I definitely reccommend this book for a fun, easy read."
1,Clearly an amateur,"I cannot figure out where all these 5 star reviews are coming from,maybe the authors friends. Heavy on dialogue is one thing, but this book, if you will even call it that, is 90% dialogue. Not to mention the fact that the author's bouncing around from one time frame to another without any clear rational is the least of the problems. It's almost like someone did a first draft in a couple of weeks, and didn't bother to do any editing. I read a ton of books, and this might be one of the worst I've ever read. The humor involved is tiresome, cliched drivel."
2,Loved the poems BUT,"It would have been better if the table of contents had hyperlinks that would allow the reader to jump to the page of the selected poem. This edition doesn't allow that, thus the 2 star rating."
3,Very romantic !!!,"Interface: Poetry and Selected Readings, Volume One, 2010I was looking for a poetry book of ancient poems and found a lot more. Many of the poems are popular ones and are somewhat ancient. These are poems written in a foreign tongue and not the common tongue but a lot of technical skills has gone behind it. But the paper quality is very poor and the cover design is boring to look at. You cannot beat the price though."
3,A good introduction to poets,"For me, I guess I prefer a book by a single author. I get to find out about the person behind the words more when I read a book entirely by one person. It is a good compilation and if you like that kind of thing, then go for it. For myself, I just like it better to be a single pen. It has great poets in it. William Shakespeare, Wordworth, Shelly, Poe, Whitman, Dickinson, Frost and more. I guess it could be use like a teaser, to get you interested in more poets and set you off to find a complete works by the ones you liked. There is a bit of history on each one before the poem, so that is nice too."
3,Not what I was looking for,"There are many anthologies of ""Best Loved"" poems. I was hoping to find the Kindle version of the book that my English teacher gave me in high school around 30 years ago but this wasn't it. This anthology seems to have selected one poem per author as ""best loved"" and I can't say that I agree with the editor's picks, though it does have many famous poems in it. I have been selecting poems at random and have not read the entire book, so it's possible that parts of the book may be different than what I've found so far."
3,Buy it for what it is,"This is a good game. Quick, fast and entertaining. The lush cinematic sequences during the game create an excellent atmosphere and the D&D mechanics are well adapted to an arcade format. The game survives on coolness alone, with the character moves and cinematic feel of the action, and it will definetly keep you entertained. Do not, however, let yourself be fooled with the allegedly ""intense storyline""; it's lame, predictable, the characters are cardboard cutouts and will definetly leave you cold. Just turn off your brain, pick up your joypad (absolutely necessary, and still some control problems with the PC version, forcing you to use keyboard keys for the very important funcion of switching characters) and immerse yourself in the furious action of the very well executed fight scenes."
2,quick to dissapoint,"great graphics, and that's about it.Story line is too indepth for a hack and slash, though I am a big fan of Salvatore. Game play is repetative and too do this do that controlled."
3,good story but obvious platform game,this games graphics were good for how old it was and the story line was writen by my favorite author but the controls were obviously ment for a playstation game but for what it costs id say its worth the purchase
5,good fit,this model fit my 07 g5 very well. I would suggest this to anyone trying to protect their vehicle. Locks fuel tank nicely
4,Stant fuel caps are the best,"Like a previous reviewer, I could not find this fuel cap anywhere. None of the major auto parts places carried it. Amazon not only had it, but also had the best price! It seems to fit well and lock well. The true test will be tomorrow when I drive it;[keeping my fingers crossed that the dashboard light does not come on.] This fuel cap doesn't provide miracles, it just gives you a little peace of mind that no one can siphon your gas or put something into your tank. Thanks Stant and Amazon!"
2,The Book of Eleanor,Not very well written.Skips decades without explanation and oblique references to things that happened in those decades.I expected something close to a biography in the form of historical fiction. This was mainly historical fiction.Did do a nice job in following up on Eleanor's daughters. Not enough is written about Eleanor's daughters and it was nice to see historically correct information about their adult years.
1,Not what I thought...,"Ok, I guess I misled myself on this one. My parents have this game for their Wii, and I enjoyed playing it when I was there. So when I saw it was available for my PS2 (and cheap) I thought 'why not?' But it was nothing like the Wii version, not even half the same games. Plus, it doesn't even work on my PS2! I played it at somebody's else's house with no problem, but I get a disk error on mine! Could be an error on my end, but I have no problems playing any other game. So this was a disappointing buy."
2,Really basic and super male-centric,"I felt that this book was very simplistic in its explanations and its exercises. That's not to say that sometimes the simple exercises aren't the hardest, but rather I could've and really have thought of these things before. It also was completely centered on the male experience of sex addiction. All of the case stories were about men and most of the examples of behaviors/thinking were very male oriented (ex. going to strip clubs, hiring prostitutes, thinking that women want to be dominated) and completely ignored the particular way that women experience sex addiction. Resources that I've found to be more powerful and insightful: the basic text for SLAA (Sex & Love Addicts Anonymous) and ""Women, Sex, & Addiction"" by Charlotte Kasl. This last text is the only one I've ever seen that adequately deals with the female experience."
1,Poor reference for PCB construction,"I have a little PCB construction experience and wanted to get some expert advice and pointers. This book was a serious disappointment. It skipped over much nomenclature that a true beginner would not understand and did nothing to improve my knowledge. The writing is sketchy, especially later in the text. The formatting seems to be messed up; there are bulleted lists in the middle of pages with no context. Finally, the text copies (plagerizes?) some TI docs (74LS08) and does not give TI credit. Save your money and find another book to buy."
3,I'll be seeing you,This cd is not just Beryl Davis and the music is quite recent compared to record 'I hear a dream'
5,HOTTEST UNDISCOVERED UNDERGROUND!!!!,I listened to the CD from start to finish and the WHOLE thing JAMMED HARD!! I know they are H-Towns hottest undiscovered underground label out and when they get picked up --For sure PLATINUM!!! Don't miss the bunus CD---I got more than my $$ worth with the 1st one and the bonus tracks got me hooked for LIFE!!! This is the best all in all CD on the market.
1,Cheap,"The watch is very cheaply made. The watch came with the battery cover OFF and it could not be put on. So if you want to wear a watch where the battery and the watch's working parts are exposed, than this watch is for you! If you want a watch that you can wear, and be water proof as advertised, than this isn't the one!"
4,JAKE GOT RINGSIDE SEATS FOR WRESTLE INSANITY!!!,"Yep, Jake got 'em. Ringside tickets. Being the great fans of wrestling they are, they are really excited. Andy sneaks backstage and switches bodies using the mini- dits (a small replica that switches bodies of ppl). He starts getting beat up in the match and is making a total fool of the wrestler who's body Andy is in. Can Jake and Josh stop the madness???"
2,Different from prior versions,"I would certainly recommend this item because of its 2006 updated information; however, if you are accustomed to the prior versions of QuickLook, be prepared for it to be a lot different. There is a delay before the program opens. When you search for a medication name, the result shows at the very bottom of the search result field instead of at the top where prior versions show and where it would be most logical, and the appendix tab is 'hidden' in the filter dropdown which overall makes this a more time-consuming process. It does have the same great features, but it's different and more cumbersome to use."
1,Run-- Do Not Walk Away from this film...,"I was a big Asimov fan and made the mistake of seeing this film when it came out in the cinema, since it was the first movie made from an Asimov idea since ""Fantasic Voyage"" YUCK! Over half the audience LEFT the movie and by the time it was over I wished I had, too.This movie has nearly NOTHING to do with the original novella and undoubtedly was the major reason that no other works of Asimov have been adapted to film (even though they are among the most deserving to be adapted)I continuously wondered throughout the film what major chemicals the cast and crew were consuming throughout the production. The acting, the cast and the production values are among the worst I have ever seen outside of old 8mm student films with budgets of less... I think we have a film here that can easily displace ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" as the worst movie of all time.Please boycott this film."
2,Bleh...,"Probably the only difference from the average review here is that mine gives an extra star. I've not read Nightfall but I have read a couple of Asimov's Foundation books (Prelude to Foundation twice). I wanted to see if there were any movies out there of his work. Nightfall was the only one I found so far, so I wanted to check it out...Well, aside from cute Jennifer Burns and finding a few Space-y shots intriguing (for my 2nd star), I'm convinced it doesn't do the book justice---or rather it ruins it. Right away I thought, 'Serious? Low-budget, crappy, acting?, weak, 2000?...etc.' I thought part of it was made in 1970's. Really unfortunate I say. I wonder if they actually collaborated with the man for input or simply went from the book and applied their subpar film skills for such a work.I hope better Asimov films rise from truly talented filmmakers. I'm hoping for Prelude to Foundation 'cuz it's my favorite. And the actress shouldn't just be cute (sorry Jen), but cute AND a great actor."
3,Not That Bad,"No, it is not the classic story written by Asimov. In fact, it seems very loosely based on it. Apart from this fact, the movie is mildly entertaining and NOT the terrible anti-classic that most of the other people writing reviews seemed to think. Overall a decent movie, decently acted."
5,A have to read,This is the first book by Mark Twain that I have read. I found it by searching through the Kindle book store and liked the title. I read the reviews and decided to order it. I am so glad I did. I began reading it as soon as it downloaded and only put it down when I could not keep my eyes open any longer. As soon as I woke up I began reading again. The dilect was a little hard at first but as soon as I got the hang of it I very much enjoyed it.
4,PSYCHEDELIC POP HEAVEN,"For those people out there who thought director Tinto Brass only made movies about female bottoms, you will be pleasantly surprised with this gem. Cult Epics should be congratulated for releasing this wonderful hommage to Giallo films, comic books, swinging sixties London and Humphrey Bogart. Movie fans who loved Mario Bava's 'Danger:Diabolik' and Roman Coppola's 'CQ' will love this film and Ewa Aulin never looked sexier. Quality is fair to good with bright vibrant colors and in 1.85 wide screen in its Italian language with English subtitles. Also includes great audio commentary with Director Brass although sometimes his heavy accent is hard to decipher. Recommended"
4,very good among camomile tea bags,"I like camomile tea, and this one is among the best tea bags and gives a mild, soothing flavor. Very good for morning calm or when ready for bed."
2,Ugly color,"I ordered this umbrella thinking it would be a neutral canvas or beige color. I got the umbrella about one foot out of the box and said ""ewww"". it is sort of a yellowish beige color. Really ugly. Back to Amazon!"
5,Works well,The charger tower looks exactly like the one it replaced. It works. No more need be said.
5,great,I would say this is basically the same as the original product. In any case it works great. Very satisfied.
3,Definitely not bad...,"I'm a fan of a lot of Steel Guitar and Hawaiian classics, and i love the old recordings i've heard. I also love Kid Koala's stab at this type of genre. So, i'm a little biased.While this cd's good, some of the ""Hawaiian"" elements feel a little gimmicky, and something about it feels a little too clean. Some tracks are absolutely spot on; others feel like Jack Johnson b-sides (which isn't necessarily bad), and others are annoying at best. Still, gotta give 'em credit, and it IS a debut. So i'm hoping for a little more of the dirt next time around. There is a lot of history to Hawaiian music, and i tihnk they'd be better off letting that show a little more."
1,MAKE SURE YOU HAVE WIN98 CD,you must have your windows 98 disk to load the camera to your computer. I dont have mine and can't download my pictures so i have a camera i cant use
5,Convenient,"I got this camera for a trip to Ireland. What a good move.Not only did it last the entire trip in my pocket, in humidity changes, temp changes, altitude/pressure changes, but i came back with over 200 8x10 quality pictures! A 128meg memory card allowed me to take more pictures durring a day than i ever needed. Bringing the upload cable allowed me to dump my images onto cd-r's every couple days. it comes with software to manage pictures, merge panoramas, etc. Definitely the most user-friendly digital camera i've used as well. The menu system is simple and easy to navigate.The flash on the camera is outstanding. Taking pictures in a pitch-black room gave me images that seemed like daytime.There are too many features of this camera to list here.I bring this camera with me to work, to my parents' house (when i visit), on short trips, to the beach, etc. What an amazing product.If you are in the market for a digital camera, this should be on the top of your list."
4,"Battery life, et al.","Neat camera. LCD use sucks the battery flat. Canon's web site suggests turning the LCD off--which does NOT prevent viewing the snapped photo. Snap a photo, keep the shutter button held down and the pic will show in the LCD. Release the button and the LCD goes out. Five stars if the menus were intuitive. Take everywhere and enjoy."
5,My favorite toy!,"I purchased this camera for daily use and I use it everywhere. It's simply awesome and the quality od pic's are incredible. Another great thing about it is that it's so compact and easy to use. You can carry it with you anywhere and just take a shot. The menu functions are easy to read and the lcd monitor is sharp for it's size. The only thing I would recommend is that you upgrade the 8mb compact memory card since you can only take 11 pictures at 1200 x 1600 resolution and 46 at the lowest resolution. The software is super easy to use and once you connect the USB port to the camera, the sofware automatically opens up with the pictures right in front of you. It's a great buy and no one will be disappointed."
1,Canon Digital Elph S100 USB compatibility stinks,"This camera claims to be USB compatible but is not! It is only compatible with computers running Windows 98 or 2000, not NT and then only with computers with the latest USB standard. Most computers built over 6 months ago do not comply with this standard. Before purchasing, go to your PC manufacturers web-site or call them to check on compatibility. As an laternative Canon recommends a [memory] card reader but these have the exact same issue. I have NOT yet been able to load pictures onto my PC so have NOT been able to send or print anything whatsoever. The camera does NOT support serial or any other connections, which I knew when I purchased, however Canon's literature both on the web and in-print is very misleading with respect to USB compatibility."
3,I wanted to love this camera,"In the next 8 hours I have to decide if I am going to return my elph. And I am stumped, here's why:Inconsistent quality control -I bought one that had a big green dot in the middle of the LCD screen so I returned it. The new one I bought has a big problem with white balancing - caucasian skin tones turn yellow brown indoors with the flash, and black shapes become two dimensional in dim light. In addition - the LCD does not work in dim light.But on the other hand -Size- I have taken more pictures in the last 29 days than in the last 6 months. Wow Factor - everyone at every party loves to play with it Digital Convenience - not having to worry about film, you can shoot away at things you never would waste development cost on.So do I return it and pay 200 more for a Fuji 40i? Or do I wait a year for the next generation and continue to shoot on film.You decide."
3,Tangled Webs and Other Complications,"Even though I love this series, I gave this book three stars because (1) I do not think it is important to keep describing the sex between the same two characters in their every scene that leads to sex (so I just skipped over it which means I probably lost some fascinating story line dialog, but nothing that apparently detracted from the overall series), and (2) It was not necessary to make William Sebastian's son. Both of those things detracted from the story. That being said, Bea was my favorite character in this book. She represented every girl/woman out there who's taken a wrong turn in their young lives and unheeded, just kept going. God Bless Amy Winehouse. May she rest in peace."
1,gardener,"What a piece of junk. I bought this radio to use around the yard in September of 2010. AM disappeared after four months. The preset buttons do not work anymore, it was not easy for me to set them either. On top of all that, it seemed like I was replacing the batteries monthly. There must be something better out there with digital tuning that you can listen to w/o headphones. Could it have been the worthless clock that used up all battery power? I would not even give this one star. It just seems like things are not made to last anymore."
5,Easy to use,"This radio is compact and easy to use, ""even a cave man could use it"". Sound quailty is good. I use it in a brick building and reception is very good too. I've only had it a couple of weeks so not really sure about the battery life yet. NO problems as of this time."
2,Tough to find a small radio these days....,"I had high hopes but this radio does not fill them. First, FM sensitivity, (the ability to pick up weak stations) seems worse than my cheapo Sony analog radio. Your lucky to get all the stations you are accustomed to. Alternate channel selectivity (the ability to sort out one station from another when they are close in frequency) was lousy. But the worst part of all is the FM noise floor. This radio when receiving a strong signal is not quiet. You can hear background hiss on a strong station even in MONO mode. So I either got a bad sample of this product or this is simply a very average performing radio. I would say not worth the price. not recommended."
2,"Not bad for the low price, but...",It is perfect to put under your rear view mirror so that you can see your baby and not have to sacrifice your big one. The only problem is that everything is pretty small. Only good for a check on safety. Not enough for the child to see you back.
2,Don't bother with this one!,"Bought this necklace with the matching earrings. The colors of the beads are dull and the clasp andextender are cheap, cheap, cheap. O.K. for a young tween or child but a big disappointment for anadult. No length or width dimensions were posted on the product and the beads look smaller in person.Don't waste your money!"
5,EXCELENTE PRODUCTO,"todo OK se instaló y esta funcionando perfectamente, no necesita configuración, en mi caso la tarjeta madre de mi PC cuenta con dos ranuras para memoria, sustitui la que tenía por una de estas y coloqué otra igual para la ranura desocupada, la instalación es muy sencilla, solo entra de una solo forma debido a una mueca que tiene en la parte inferior lo que evita una posible confusión, la tarjeta madre tiene unos ganchos de seguridad que con solo colocarla y empujarla se cierran, no debería, pagar para su instalación.PNY OPTIMA 1GB DDR 333 MHz PC2700 Desktop DIMM Memory Module MD1024SD1-333"
5,Perfect upgrade for the Dimension 2400,"I used to have 128 MB on my dimension 2400 windows XP that is about 8 years old (got in 03) and just recently i upgraded the memory with this 1Gb. It's now a lot faster and works very well. Of course, I do recommemnd also upgrading the CPU, amongst other things.Its only $30 and the best 1GB upgrade available."
1,"This is a pair of 512 KB memory sticks, not a single 1 GB stick","A single 1 GB memory stick is shown, but it is actually a package of two separate 512 KB memory sticks. The package I received was clearly re-labeled as this part number (MD1024SD1-333). I ordered two items (2 GB), but my computer doesn't have room for the four memory sticks that I received."
1,I was srewed /Ripped OFF /,I was sent something that will not work and the seller knows and dosen't care He Just wantedthe money.NO response [contacted 3 times] NO response from AMAZON either . I did not receive pny optima 512-ddr 333mhz PC2700 desktop DIMM / MD0512sd1-333 . What I was given will not allow to be inserted into memory SLOT .I was sent PC 100/8x64 m004101s !
1,Not sure why,"Installed the RAM which created intermittent errors. Not sure if I screwed up and ordered wrong, though its labeled same as previous RAM. Make sure what you order."
1,Poor Quality,"Purchased this for a Christmas gift just last year. And have already thrown it away. In putting it together it was not looking like it would hold up. And that it did not, the weight of albums bowed the bottom. And in moving it away from wall afew inches to clean behind, top broke off and split at sides!"
2,not for me,"I found this book a drudgery to read. It was required for my class, I would never have tortured myself otherwise."
1,Waste of time and money,"To be honest, this book was pretty badly written. The author seems to have trouble leading the reader from one sentence to the next. Also, the information presented in the book are not very useful for someone who just has SOME form of access to general reading material like news, magazine and internet articles. All the book does is telling us the obvious in a different way. I don't learn anything new from reading this book. If you are totally clueless about lefties, you may learn something. Otherwise, don't buy this book. It's a waste of your time and money."
2,Calculator,I am not very impressed with this unit.THere are many cheaper units available with more features.I seldom use it prefering other units that I own.
4,"Charming, Entertaining and Somewhat Sobering","Burns has produced a fascinating book and demonstrated that alcohol, as well as Americans' ambivalent attitudes towards it, has been an important subtheme in American history. Breezy and energetic, the book is well organized and moves briskly through many good stories of temperance wars. A fascinating read and a reliable historical reference."
3,a mixed up book,"This book has some usual abercrombie style photos of half naked guys and girls. It also have a picture of Robert De Niro. Then it has pictures of dogs, old people, nature.In the end of the book, it had about 5 pages of Weber's sort of bibliography. It is quite interesting."
5,Terrific device to save money!!!,"How anyone can criticize this product is beyond me! Although I didn't buy this on Amazon, I had to throw in my ""2 cents"". (I bought on ebay for $44).OK, so it has a few limitations....call waiting? Small color screen? What? Why is everyone so picky? This is a telephone. Use it to make FREE phone calls. It worked excellent right out of the box. I could wander 2 rooms away from computer and got perfect reception. I have not had any dropped calls either.If you want all those special features, pay the phone company. I am saving about $30/month. I LOVE SKYPE and this Linksys phone!"
2,Great when it works,It is the the third GPS Unit I have bought. It is great when it works but it has broken (won't power up) for the second time since I bought in in fall of 2001. Last time I sent it to Garmin for repair I had to send it back again after they returned it still broken.
5,Magical Feelings,"This CD is wonderful. The story is read by an a person with unspeakable talent. When hearing this story it sets you back in a time of pleasantness, and utter joy. Listen to this CD and you will be taken into another world, one of joy, hope, and tranquillity."
4,Works great,"I have used the USB version with my laptop and since my desktops have SCSI but not USB, I just connect it with the SCSI cable and it works great with those computers. Love the 2.2 GB.."
4,Gets the job done,"They get the job done, are a lot less harsh than using a flat head screwdriver. No scratches yet. Only thing is that they aren't as stiff as I thought they would be. They have some give but are sturdy enough to get the job done. I do use them to pull off tabs from my honda civic to get under the bumper and wheel wells. You do need to pry the tabs with a screwdriver first once and a while otherwise these work for that too. Make sure you don't use alot of force or have alot of flex in the tool if you are removing those tabs. I had one shot out and catch me in the eye. For that I'm buying the screwdriver style fastener tab remover. But these are a good buy if you are look for something like this."
3,They do what they are advertise,"Quality is good, no sharp edges. Seems to be a quality product, just a little bit bendy for me as I would like a bit stiffer product."
3,good poster,im happy with the poster...its hangin in my office where evryone can see it. everyone that walks in has asked me and its a good way of passing along chinaski to other people
3,Death By Owl Eyes,"""Death by Owl Eyes"" is my all time favorite song and Carolyn does it no justice, I can only imagine that MK sang it like a wonder....."
4,First pair of yoga shorts that fit..,OK..These are very nice.. a built in brief so I don't have to wear anything under them..I had a nice pair of shorts that worked well and I was loathe to spend this kind of money on yoga specific clothes .. but. I needed another pair of shorts .. It works well for yoga .. stretchy .. comfortable .. dries fast.. I do hot power yoga and these work well!! .. I do wish they were a little longer.. below the knee... but I knew the length when I bought thembut.. why do yoga clothes cost twice as much as regular athletic clothes..!!5 stars for use3 stars for price4 stars overall..
3,Great for home use.. not so much for commercial use.,"I've had this peeler for about 2 months now and while I had it, it was a great peeler. Peels through the skin of a sweet potato no problem and it doesn't take off too much which is great for asparagus.However, through more and more use peeling many potatoes and asparagus, i've noticed the swivel head does not lock on anymore so while i'm peeling a potato the blade rotates which is a nuisance. Now my blade seems to have broke and there are little chips in the blade. It still peels but it barely takes anything off and the width of which it peels has been reduced. I've had the blade come off of the peeler but I could put it back in and haven't broken the hinges that connect the blade to the peeler itself.All in all, great tool but expensive for a commercial style peeler that will now be used as a paper weight sadly."
3,"Very nice blade, but BROKE EASILLY, and no potato eye remover","Very nice blade, but BROKE EASILLY, and no potato eye remover..I had mine maybe a year or more... Never dropped, never abused in any way.. One day I picked it up and the cutter fell off..I always thought this was the best peeler I ever owned, and wondered THE HELL WHY THERE WAS NO POTATO EYE REMOVER??? Which is probably a prime time thing to have on a device such as this.. I gave it 3 stars rather than 1 because it is so nice in so many ways (red is easy to find, multi positions make it so you can pick your favorite, very nice peeling blades).. But easy to break, and no eye remover are kind of biggies.."
3,Not as sharp as expected,"I was disappointed in the quality of the blade. It isn't nearly as sharp as the peelers I am used to (e.g., the cheapest ones from Williams-Sonoma)."
2,Great design but fatal oversight in construction.,"After less than a dozen uses, it broke and is now useless. If you look at the image of the product, you can see how the blades are housed in the black rotating frame. The problem is, the black frame is held in the red brace by tiny black plastic protrusions on both sides. Minimal pressure can make one of these snap clean off, as it did with me. Now it is worthless. Great idea, poor execution. Wait until they make a new version with metal protrusions."
5,Sharp and slick!,"I gave this peeler 5 stars because you are able to peel from almost every angle you can think of. The ceramic blade is super sharp, it will never rust like all those other peelers.Kycera Perfect Ceramic Peeler (Rotating) Red"
2,RIP peeler,"I love this peeler, it is great. However I have to give it a bad review because it is also very fragile. I have owned this peeler for almost a year to the day when the little plastic pins snapped. For a twenty dollar peeler I expect a whole lot more."
4,It works,"I did feel a difference, I have degenarative arthritis in my hip and L5-S1,and the pain of this and all other joints. This Tumeric force did help!!"
2,Not as great as they claim,"I really couldn't see where it helped that much. I have fibromyalgia and hoped this would help with general inflamation in my body, but my latest blood panel didn't show any improvement."
4,good vitamin,it has slightly higher concentration in some of the nutrients i decided i need so i alternate it with my other multivitamins. i am taking supplements due to th low iron and potassium percentages but the other nutrients it has makes it worth keeping in my diet.
4,Upcountry Bounty,"Just returned from ""Paradise"" (Maui)and had a chance to visit the wonderful ""Hali'imaile General Store"" restaurant-what a experience!! Outstanding meal (didn't get a chance to sample the 'crab dip'-and unfortunately, it's not in the cookbook),amazing artwork, unbelievable floral arrangements and excellent service!!I just had to buy the cookbook and I'm so glad I did-the same wonderful foods, artwork and floral arrangements are in the cookbook-wait until you see the pictures-breathtaking!! It's more than a cookbook (with some wonderful receipes)it's a picture book to enjoy!!"
4,"A fine radio, a mediocre MP3 player","This device makes an excellent shower radio. It's FM only. It can store 20 station presets in 2 banks of 10. The volume can go loud enough to be easily heard in the shower. Battery life is excellent (at least 2 months on my first set). It even comes with an external wire antenna in case you need better reception; this is amazing.As an MP3 player it leaves much to be desired. It comes with a ""pavit"" which is some sort of USB flash drive. At only 32MB, it holds about 6 songs. Supposedly there will be a 128MB pavit available, but I can't find one for sale online. The player doesn't recognize mp3 files loaded from OSX, so you must use the included Windows software to load mp3s on the pavit. The software didn't recognize a 512mb flash drive that I plugged into the computer."
2,You get what you pay for,"I wasn't expecting anything great, but was a little disappointed when it was missing the Security T20 Torx bit (something I commonly need), and instead had an extra size 0 Phillips bit. Sorting them into their spots (half of them are loose in the container) wasn't too bad since they are marked with what size they are (up to the user to determine what type of bit it is). The magnetic quick connect bit holder is a wobbly piece of junk that is so off center, you can't drive a screw without jumping out.For the money, it's OK if you need a bunch of random bits and don't plan to do any serious work. I think I'll go ahead and spend extra on a quality set that isn't made in China. The Torx bits are cut very poorly, and half the security bits aren't drilled concentric."
4,Like it,"I'm not sure if this really is working. But, the size of the pills is easy to swallow. I believe keep taking this for a long time will improve the system. I like it."
5,"Light-weight, well-designed, comfortable cast aluminum patio chair","We bought eight of these for our patio. They are easy to move around because of their light weight. The seat is very comfortable and dries quickly after rain. Several of the chairs were tippy on the diagonal, but the screw levelers at the bottom of the legs evened them out. We look forward to many years of enjoying them for eating, reading, socializing, and warming up around the aluminum firepit table we also bought by Strathwood. Thank you."
3,looking for pork seasoning by lawry,"I was looking for a pork seasoning by Lawry that I bought a while back and my family loved it. Since you didn't seem to have it, I tried the chicken. Not the same."
2,Maram,"I was so excited to get my oil-food color but got really disappointed when I got the box. All colors melted and spilled outside the small containers. I barely can use any of them. I'm sure Wilton colors are one of the best but wish if they can pack them ina better way, make sure they're sealed so that customers wont get them spelled all over the box!I like the product but the shipment method ruined it"
1,This game is good for nick!,"Nick has had some bad games in the past but this is not one of them. This game is oneOf their very best. The game is a little boring the first few moments of the game. ButThats the pacing for it. Games have to introduce the characters and their qualities.And this game has very good gameplay.Good characters with interesting powers are shown in this game. Their special powers areOnly a little repetative at the beginning. Later in the game the gang learns many new andOutstanding moves. They all have trademark moves and fighting styles. The enemies includeDark wolves and Canyon Crawlers. All of which are original to the show.Giant machines unknown to the show are also in the game. Such as the final boss.After all being a nick game, it is extremely easy. But the game gives youMuch to fight. The plot could be worked on a bit though. The story isExtremely basic and corny. But it was still a good game."
2,Ridiculously long (24-48 h) drying time,"I've used numerous different Epson paper products and liked them all. But, this was my first (and last) purchase of Epson Presentation Paper - Matte. This paper is advertised as being for ""everyday projects,"" but requires special handling: 1. Let paper dry for 15 minutes, 2. Put it on a flat surface and cover it with a sheet of plain white paper for 24 HOURS, 3. Check to see if covering paper exhibits waviness, and 4. If covering paper is wavy, replace it with a new sheet and wait another 24 hours. 24-48 hour drying times for ""everyday projects"" paper? Epson's highest quality coated photo paper dries faster.Other issues: The paper is too flimsy for most presentations (40-50 lb weight is needed, this paper is only 27 lb). The paper is a rather dull white. Even with proper printer settings, the output was too saturated and too dark."
4,Good for Crafts and Photo Projects for school,"Think about it. The paper is 100 sheets for 11 dollars. That's VERY inexpensive for photo paper. I used this paper to make nice wrappers for around Hershey's candy to make favors for a 50th wedding anniversary. It is also great for making photo pages for the sports teams memory books. It is thin enough to not make the pages bulky, but thick enough to not let colors bleed through. I use it with an HP printer and it works great. I don't own an Epson, so I could not say how it works. I do know that it works great for sending a collage of photos to several people as it is inexpensive and the thickness makes it easy to fold into and envelope.(I did just that for Christmas cards) I would not use this for making long lasting photos, but if you want a better quality page than normal paper, this is the route to go!"
4,"Great book filled with Seuss' best, but too bulky for young child.","Bought this so my 3-year-old son could enjoy some of Dr. Seuss's best stories, the ones I fell in love with as a kid. Seemed like a good deal to get many stories in one, instead of buying all of the books separately. The book has some interesting anecdotal/historical essays (written by the who's-who in the literary/dramatic arts field) to each story which are interesting to adults, but your young child will care less about. My only true complaint about the book is that it is large and very heavy and therefore too difficult for a young child to handle by himself. Since my son is only 3 I hold it and read it to him now, so it's not a deal-breaker by any means."
3,Okay,"This book is a collection of Dr. Suess books, and it is very handy, and reasonably priced! It lacks some of the classics though, like One Fish Two Fish Red Fish Blue Fish. It is however a great book to read in bed, despite the largeness!"
3,Only part of what I bargained for,"I just started playing first person shooters and needed a corded mouse for better optical tracking. I was using the Microsoft wireless optical mouse which I love, but isn't ideal for playing FPSs. The optical tracking on this mouse is outstanding, but there were a few problems. I went in to the software to program the buttons and went to program the thumb button, and you can only program it as a keyboard key or keyboard function. The scroll button you can actually program as just a button, which annoys me because I can not use it for the game. I also went to the store and bought an new optical mousepad for the desk which was padded, as the one I had before wasn't. The mouse jumps around the screen when I use the padded mousepad. It worked flawlessly once I got frustrated and threw the new mousepad on the floor and went back to the uncushioned one. I do like the mouse, but there are just a few changes I would make."
4,review,"I've had this mouse for quite some time now. It's been pretty good, but there are times where it would jump around the screen for no reason at all. It would often get on my nerves, but other than that, it is convenient and works fine when it isn't jumping around the screen."
3,Could have been better!,"The author states in the notes that he could not afford to hire an editor. However, he COULD afford to proof read! He also mentioned he didn't feel like going back to re-write a sequence in the book to make it better. WHAT?!!! A true writer is passionate about his/her work and strives to make it the best it can be. Although Mr. Smith does have talent, I think he has a way to go if he wants to make a name for himself in the literary world. I cringed each time I saw a typo. There were so many it was ridiculous!"
2,It's okay....,"Be very careful how much you use....it does weigh your hair down if you use too much. While I like B&B products, I don't see myself buying this again. No real benefit to using it."
2,A True Non-Phish Experience,"""SHOCKED"" was the only word that came to mind while hearing this box set. The thought of brilliant musicians such as Phish releasing such a sloppy display of music is beond my comprehention. Sure, the set-lists look quite promising, but how does the music sound? Slopy, and loose. After attending 25 shows, I can honestly say that I would rather have a Box Set of 24 of them rather than this. I understand having a ""bad night"" on stage, but to sell it is another story. Needless to say, I look forward to many more mind-blowing Phish shows, I just can't understand why the band would agree to release these as an example of their work."
2,Shred Elsewhere,"I have owned this shredder for a few months now, and several issues have become apparent.1. The container is small. If you shred more than 15-20 sheets you will have to empty the machine.2. The machine is noisy. Plan on waking up the neighbors.3. Paper will eventually get caught in the rotors and jam the machine. My machine actually pulls paper into the casing where the motor is. This has to be a fire hazard!Overall, I would recommend that you look elsewhere for a scanner. This one is not worth the hassle."
1,Dreadful Audio Book/Excellent Bonus Features,"Hein narrates his first book, Opening Minds, in an amateurish, monotonous and anesthetizing drone that would cure the most resistant case of insomnia. Hein's unimaginative original sound track does not hide the fact that he has obvious difficulties in pronouncing his own text nor does it off-set the awkward pauses that punctuate the entire work.The bonus features are the saving grace of this entire recording. The Bashar and Mother Earth channeling sessions will delight fans of both entities. Hein's acoustic selections run the gamut from well produced elevator music to the beautifully sublime voice of vocalist Elisa Brown. His radio and television interviews are engaging, informative and fun. Its a shame that Hein did not choose to narrate his audio book with the same authenticity that resonates in these vibrant interviews."
3,not as good as,"Loofas never really did it for me, but for as long as I can remember ,I've been passively looking for a decent back scrubber. I have broad shoulders and it seems impossible to get that spot in the middle of my back and below my shoulder blades. Being a little fed up I ordered this one and the aquis and this one had slightly better than usual results. The Aquis Backscrubber had more contact, more abrasive, longer. If you like loofas this is probably a good one for you."
1,Just painful!,I tried it and just didn't like it. I swore it took whatever hair I had off my back plus a few layers of skin! I was beat red and was in some minor pain afterwards. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone!
2,Dull and pure 'whitebread' hokum,"This is dull tripe, totally lacking in character. The singers may not all be Caucasian, but they certainly sound it. Better to go back to the originals, or listen to 'Sophisticated Ladies' which has 10 times the character of this. This is certainly not the way to be introduced to such great music (complete with out-of-period and horrid 'orchestrations'). I think the composers were all collectively rolling in their graves when they heard this CRAP!"
5,A fabulous score to an eye-popping show,"Any who have seen ""Swing"" on Broadway know that the dancing is fantastic. But those who love swing music, good singing, and superior musical arrangements will love this recording. The singing is top-rate, no matter who is doing it; and the arrangements are complex and delightful. I can't stop listening to this CD. So, if you love swing, go for it!"
1,Junk,"I purchases this item and installed in my pond April 1, 2012. In less than 30 days one of the lights went out...I let it go. Last night another light went out (today is 6/23/2012). I purchased an inexpensive egg light set 18 months ago that have been in my waterfall since last year and through a cold Wisconsin winter yet they still work. I do not understand why these lasted for 60 days, I wouldn't purchase again."
4,Color ink cartridge for Epson 1280 printer,"The colors are very good (blues) to outstanding (reds and blacks-the black is in its own separate cartridge of course). I get about 20-30 full page 8x10 color prints on Matte paper per color cartridge. This is a much more realistic idea of ink use than Epson's claim of over 300 with 5% coverage...you buy this printer to do photos, not to make text pages with a little color on them. Nevertheless, the ink quality is very good."
1,Not Epson as advertised,"Although I suspected as much, when I received these cartridges they were some off-brand made in China. Everything in the listing said ""Epson"" and even showed Epson packaging (I saved the original page), so I thought maybe these were just grey market instead of being made for sale in the US. Some off-brands can really foul up a printer, and who knows about fading, etc., so I'm not about to use them. I've returned the items, so we'll see if I get a prompt refund."
5,Best for photos,"I've tried discount brands and they work fine until I print photos. I have had amazing results, but not the kind I wanted as images took on strange colors."
5,Best of the bunch.,"I've had Bushnell range finders for the last 5 or 6 years. They worked ok, but are bulky, and both of them finally petered out, and Bushnell refused to fix, just wanted to sell me the new 1500...I used the 1500 for a week, and it was ok, then I ran into the Nikon Laser Caddy, that a friend was using. The Nikon was much smaller, and with the scan feature, much easier to use. I sent the 1500 back, bought the Nikon, saved about $100, and I love it. Maybe its because I'm used to range finders, so I had no difficulty locking on to targets. All the range finders have gotten better, and this is the best of the bunch....wish it had a nicer case, the one it came with is cheap."
5,Nikon LaserCaddy 500G,Can't beat Nikon glass! Great optics. I've compared it to several Bushnell models and the Nikon is clearer. It give fast readings easily up to 300+ yds. There is slight magnification which is a nice feature. Easy to hold steady and best of all it's SMALL enough to fit in your pocket during play. It's a hassle trying carry around (with case/in/out of cart) the Bushnell 1500 during play. HIGHLY recommend!
2,This is the strangest one yet,"I tried this book because I enjoyed her book Love Invents Us. This one was way out somewhere. Not only were the stories weird, they were not the kind of weird that is engrossing.In short, don't bother."
5,Indispensible,"I've been climbing sport for about a year and a half, some multi-pitch. Just started leading trad this season, thought it was time to learn how to manage accidents/crises. This book has been just right for me. I have Freedom of the Hills, but this covers self-rescue in more depth (""self"" means your party, as opposed to calling for search and rescue). It touches just briefly on ice climbing/big wall, covering topics that are applicable to most types of climbing. Table of contents: The Basics, Rescue Knots, Escaping a Belay, Descending, Ascending, Raising, Passing Knots, Scenarios and Solutions, Getting Outside Help (33 pages of 29 scenarios/solutions). The authors do a nice job of directing you to other resources outside the scope of the book. Concise, well organized chapters that build on each other logically. Set up to read straight through but also easy to reference specific topics/knots. Easy to follow diagrams/instructions. Nice mix of photos/illustrations."
1,"Weak electrical signal, no healing effect","I supposed this is a case of, ""You get what you pay for."" This TENS machine certainly doesn't cost very much. However, what it is required to do, send out a healing, electrical signal that causes tensed muscles to untense, isn't very complicated, and this device can't handle the job. The electrical signal is too weak to have any effect.I returned the product for a refund."
5,"YES, good punk","SO you want punk that is understandable and has good flow and mixes different sounds not just hard pounding guitar riffs and the same drum beat over and over again? Check these guys out... hard and edgy with melodic undertones... a great expansion of Refused, you should check them out too, this isnt as hard as refused but I still dig it and think you will too if you like Refused, Bad Religion and bands like that."
5,very well done,I am a Spanish teacher and I have been looking for a good video on Day of the Dead this is the one. I purchased two or three others and this one is by far the best.
4,Does not fit 97 Jeep Wrangler front,"Pretty sure these are the wiring harness for my sound bar (already upgraded) but these do NOT fit my front speaker harness. On a 97 Jeep Wrangler these won't work on the front, may fit sound bar. My front harness plugs are just black smooth rectangle plugs."
4,2012 Caliber Speaker Harness,I used these in a 2012 Caliber to install aftermarket speakers and the speaker harness fit with very little modification. Metra does not list this harness for this vehicle. However this harness will fit the original speaker harness in the 2012 Caliber both front and rear doors. The only modification is the polarity (+ and -) needed to be switched. The wire terminals can be removed like any other connector and switched. Swapping the wires was the only modification needed to make these work in a 2012 Caliber.Metra 72-6514 Speaker Harness for Select Chrysler/Dodge Vehicles
1,Badly designed and unreliable,"After slightly more than a year of very moderate use, one of the drive gears lost several teeth. The gear train appears to be poorly designed and not up to the task (I'm a mechanical engineer, so have some basis for judgment). I certainly wouldn't buy another one, and have not yet been able to find a source for replacement parts."
3,Zipes misses the point about Harry Potter,"While I admire Zipes work in general, I think he's missed the point about Harry Potter. Zipes remarks that Harry is a classic boy scout, a straight arrow (...). He complains that the novels follow a tedious and grating fairy tale formula (...). The only difference between Harry and anyone else, according to Zipes, is that Harry has a lightning-shaped scar on his forehead (178).Zipes misses the point on the importance of the scar - the scar is the central metaphor of the series and the importance of scars and wounding says something about our culture's adoption of this particular hero."
2,Adjustable but not rugged,"Bought 2 of these for our dogs and after 3 wears, one of the black straps came out of the seam. Since I sew I fixed it and reinforced all the places the black straps hit the orange fabric. The stitching it comes with is single line and weak. Won't last if you're dog/s run through woods/brush or wrestle. At least the price is right and it was an easy fix if you can sew. I ordered L's (1 55 pound husky and 1 55 pound lab) but which fits in around the body but the fitting is too long, so the back strap goes too far back and makes it bunch. If I had male dogs it wouldn't fit comfortably. I would order a Medium next time and loosen the black straps."
1,Bad customer service,"Sent seller e-mail asking about return policy. To date (7 days later), no reply. With customer service like this, recommend NOT buying from this company."
5,easy to see,very easy to dress the dog in it. easy to see my dog at night due to reflective stripes. adjustable straps dont stay tight though so you may have to adjust them periodically.
4,a must for spencer moody fans,not on the same level as mcd or even dead low tide but spencer's lyrical prowess is still there. sound quality is not so good but still worth the five bucks.
2,Disappointing,"I bought this for its 1280x1024 resolution, but in fact its native resolution is only 1024x768 (XGA) -- at least, that's what it says on the carton. The manual says nothing (in 14 different languages) except that the recommended resolution is 1024x768 and the maximum is 1280x1024 (on a PC). It is possible to run it at 1280x1024, but then text looks fuzzy. The monitor works very well at 1024x768, but there are much cheaper alternatives that also work well at that resolution."
2,Rehash,"The number of books in my astrology library is well over 50 books, and probably closer to 100, so when I purchase a new book on the subject, I expect to learn some new information. This book, Predicting Events With Astrology, was a huge disappointment because it was nothing more than a rehash of other better manuals on predictive astrology. It's not even a good primer for beginning astrology students. I regret having wasted $17 for it."
3,A Pleasent Waste of Time,"Being a fan of the series I decided to give this a try. It has a pretty rudimentary storyline and limited side quests. It isn't as boring as that, especially if you like the T.V. series. The makers could have put more effort into the puzzle solving adventure end of things, but the combat system works well and the animations are decent for the dated technology. If you just can't get enough Avatar, then by all means, here's another fix. Otherwise, there are bigger fish in the sea."
5,"great band, great CD","'Curious Corn' was the 1st album I heard by the Ozrics, and their heady and organic fusion of jazz as well as space rock, dub reggae, electronica, glissando guitar and exotic beats and percussion was definitely my cup of (mushroom) tea, being that Im also a big fan of bands such as Hawkwind, Gong, Shpongle, Farflung. I subsequently acquired 9 more of their CDs, including the excellent 'Live at the Pongmaster's Ball' DVD '. I would also recommend to fellow Ozrics fans an obscure band I recently found on Amazon: 'CoelacanthDance': 'Sonic Excursions and Audio Spasms', who I'd wager have been influenced by the Ozrics."
4,Amazing soloists (except for that tenor),"As a former student of Carol Smith, I heard a pirate recording of this performance. I've always been amazed by the way she and Martina Arroyo sing the incredibly difficult soprano and mezzo parts. Carol Smith's ""Liber scriptus"" will part your hair, and Martina Arroyo's ""Libera me"" will make your hair stand on end. I""m very happy this performance is available on CD."
4,Real world advice,The XP book market is getting increasingly crowded; this book differs from the pack as it walks through examples in an easy to grasp format. The book is geared towards Java developers; this is not a problem per se but non-Java developers should be aware of this. My copy of this book is beaten and worn!I think this is one of the only XP books that links back into Agile Modelling. This is very helpful as XP readers sometimes get the impression that XP throws the baby out with the bathwater; design is still important!Another aspect I liked was the inclusion of quite few photographs; this helps bridge the gap between the words and understanding. If you're seriously interested in using XP you should get this book.Where was this book 2 years ago!
3,it could work but not full proof,My 10 lb baby was strong enough to get out of the swaddler. it needs to be multiple sizes and it would help if the adjustable wrap was more adjustable. His arms got free often but if the arms wrap came around more and the velcro was stronger i think it would've worked better. So it could work just not for my baby.
2,Not very comfortable,I got these because everyone told me about the benefits of swadeling. However this is complicated and not easy to handle. Is easier to get a regular blanket.
2,Didn't work for my baby,I bought this and tried it once. The velcro doesn't hold well and it doesn't keep the baby snug. It leaves too much room to wiggle around. I found that just finding a blanket large enough to swaddle is more worth the money.
3,"Better than just a blanket, but....","Had both this and the Miracle Blanket, in addition to various receiving blankets. Would definitely go with the Miracle Blanket again, before the Swaddleme, however this is alot easier than a regular receiving blanket, and the safety of a blanket like this outweighs any negatives."
5,Awesome Product!,This blanket makes swaddling a piece of cake! My baby is unable to undo this swaddle unlike regular blankets! It helps her feel secure and I used this to assist in getting my baby to sleep alone in her own crib!
1,HORRIBLE_ DEATH TRAP!!!!!,"This item needs to be taken off the market. My son almost suffocated to death in this. He kicked his way out of it and the whole thing ended up covering his face with the velcro part. I had been hearing muffled cries, so I went in to go check on him, and he could barely breathe. I was so scared!!&^@%&!%&!^#%!&^#%& DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I repeat- DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!"
4,Great product!,My son will only sleep swaddled so this blanket is a life saver! I like the fleece one better than the cotton knit. It seems to adjust better. The cotton knit have the velcro tabs in a different position and he seems to break out of that one more than the fleece. I recommend having 3 on-hand. You never know what kind of mess they'll make in the middle of the night!
2,Get a real blanket instead,"We got this as a gift when our daughter was 2 weeks old and tried to use it even though we'd already pretty much mastered swaddling her with a stretchy thermal blanket. Even though she was born at 8 lbs and has grown quickly (over 11 lbs at this point) she practically falls out of this blanket. I don't know what size baby they were envisioning when they designed this product, but it certainly wasn't an average sized newborn.The silliest thing is that the only thing they'd have to do to remedy the problem is make the velcro area bigger to allow more tightness, but they just put this tiny patch of velcro on there making it fairly useless unless you just want a weird, non-rectangular blanket to drape on your baby. Maybe it'll work on her by the time she's 4 or 5 months old, by which time she won't want to be swaddled at all."
5,Love it!,"We used the small one until my son outgrew it, then moved to the large version. We just stopped swaddling last night (he's 6 mos) and we loved this product! He was asleep in minutes and began to know when he was placed in it, it was time to go to sleep!My new shower gift for everyone!"
3,GREAT for Short Term,I received this item at my baby shower and used it when my son was born... He was ok with it for the first 4 week but after that he wanted his hands out and then after 4 more weeks he just hated it and would find ways to get out of it... He also outgrew it very quickly. It's great for a short term sleeper but not for long term.
3,"Works Well, but too small","This blanket works really well, although they are too short. My son grew out of it by 2 & 1/2 months."
4,great product,"I bought this one for my cousin's new baby girl but I have one for my baby boy and its great. The older they get they will get their arms out though. Overall a great thing for babies to be comfy, cozy and warm at night or naptime."
2,"okay for its type, whatever that is","I was blown away by both Olivia Tremor Control releases. If you're one of the early purchasers of ""Dusk at Cubist Castle"" that got the bonus ambient disk and didn't care for it, you probably won't care much for this either. A few interesting sounds here, but overall one of those discs that you spin once, say ""hmm...interesting"" and then permanently shelf it."
3,excellent,The epson 1270 makes beautiful pictures... the ink fades if exposed to sunlight... which can be sad...
5,You Will Not Beat this Monitor for the Price,"Not only is this an excellent price for a 19"" monitor, but after several months, I am amazed at the quality of the display. It scores outstanding marks for the brightness and contrast. I have run this monitor at 1600x1200 and it looks great. The only minor issue I can find is that the control screens are a little hard to navigate through, but hey, I have a $1200 Sony as well that is even harder. If you are on a budget and want a great monitor, you won't regret this purchase."
1,AWESOME,Man o Man these are GREAT!! BUTTTT the price is outrageous!! the price totally takes away 4 stars dude. But they look great on men too. I surf andddd it gets shiny in the sun!!
1,A great product and good buy!,"A great product at a good, fair price: Nice-looking, well-made, artistically designed and attractive. The magnetized pieces make it a great chess set for travel and vacation spots (though the magnets are a bit stronger than they need to be)."
4,shredder,"Tried 2 Fellowes shredders, both of which had defective switches. So I decided to try another brand. So far, the Royal works well."
4,When Dinosaurs Ruled the Earth,"When I first saw this movie I liked it. Victoria Vetri was wonderful. For the time, the special effects were pretty good. I loved the unique way they created the language in the movie. Very creative."
4,classic babes & beasts,"This seems to be a long lost relic from Hammers 60's opus. Here in Oz I have seen it on tv twice, since 1978! And once in the UK in the 90's.It has it's own particular niche. Nowhere near 1,000,000 years bc in terms of, well, everything, but much more entertaining than ""Creatures the world forgot"". The SFX are adequate at best, the plotline absolutely insane and the dialogue may have been improved by using mere grunts, instaed of 4 or 5 ""words"" meaning anything you damn want them to.The great attraction is of legendary status. Victoria Vetri, Magda Konopka, Immogen Hassel and swarms of other 60's dolly birds in their amazingly well constructed fur bikinis. I have had shoes that didn't fit as tight!All in all, a good flic for a cold nights viewing."
1,If you want to torture someone....,"This movie is pretty bad.... The acting was horrible, the dialogue was ludicrous (a bunch of people speaking gibberish), and the so-called dinosaurs were kind of lame (most of them looked like modern day reptiles with things stuck to them). I'm not quite sure why anyone would want to watch this movie; but then again, different people have different tastes."
5,Love of the Truth,"An excellent work for anyone who wants to learn Christian Philosophy as taught by the Catholic Church. It is a faithful and comprehensive synthesis of the teaching of the Magisterium and would serve well as a text for courses in Christian Philosophy.Richard C. Caporiccio, MA - Theology, Notre Dame Graduate School of Christendom College, and Advanced Chatechical Diploma, The Holy See"
2,Not all looking is good,It's some awesome cool looking keyboard. All the keys worked everything works like a charm. Until 3 months of use and perfect take care. I used to have one and it broke (i was thinking it was my fault) so i decide to get another one.And guess what......... yeap you are right. It stop working with no reason and i take care of it like what ever i adore. So to be brief it really stink. To bad.
2,"looks and feels quality, keys quirky","The keyboard looks quality and feels quality, but I already have buttons that don't produce a letter each time I press them."
2,Too Bored to Finish,"I love fantasy, I love mythology, and I love New Mexico - used to live outside of Santa Fe - but I could not warm up to this book. While the concept of the Athanor was very interesting - Arthur Pendragon living in Abuquerque with Enkidu, Loki and Lilith running around, etc. I could never really care about the characters. It reminded me of the TV showCharmed: The Complete Series, the characters spend lots of time standing around talking about supernatural things but little time actually doing anything."
4,Not only for your car,I used this product to remove fine scratches from watches and laptop displays. When used carefully it works like a charm.
1,transfer paper,"this is a rip off for this terrible product .since the paper is the same on boht sides ,making hard and dificult to see wich side is the printing side and . in the end wasting all the transfer with out finish your work. stay away fron this product"
3,Seems OK,"It seems to work OK. The dry iron gave mediocre results. The transfers work much better with a dry mount press at about 300 degrees for 45 seconds. By all means, wait for the transfer to cool before peeling. Would purchase again."
4,Wonderful Scope of Systems Analysis and Design Methods,"Provides a wonderful scope of systems analysis and design methods, and a bunch of related topics. After reading this book, you should feel comfortable going to any organization and providing them with a model/graphic of their business processes."
3,there are better text out there,"This text book was the only one of its kind back when I took the class. However, now there are much better textbook out there."
3,Elmo tub treads... just ok,"I purchased these for my 1 year old based on the others' reviews which were very accurate. The treads will stick to the tub but they slide very easily and my baby can peel them off with little effort. Knowing this, I still bought them b/c he loves Elmo so much & I'm using them as tub ""decor."" They're fine for this purpose, but don't expect them to save a child from slipping in the tub."
1,false sense of security!,"We just moved to a new house with a slippery tub. I had a bath mat, but got these instead, thinking they'd be better and more fun for my two year old daughter. They didn't stick well at first, and I thought maybe they'd hold stronger with time. Last night, after they've been in for four days, my daughter slipped on one of them and hit her head. Cried like a banshee, and caused me a sleepless night of worrying if I'd caused permanent damage by opting for aesthetics over function. Even though she loves Elmo, I'm tossing these and going back to the bath mat. Whatever happened to those adhesive sticker treads I had in my tub when I was a kid? When I find those, I'm getting them!"
2,Cute but that's about it,"My son is a big fan of elmo so I ordered these for his bath. Well, first they do not stick at all!! But to be fair, it is written on the package that you have to have a completely smooth surface for them to stick. The second reason I don't like them and I would not even get my son close to them is that they smell so badly! The plastic chemicals kind of smell. Would not get my son exposed to that."
5,Big Hit!,My neice loves Elmo and she loves these in the bath! Perfect for the ELmo loving baby! Happy to have purchased this item.
4,Good read,"I consider this a good read....kept me coming back and staying up longer hours to read more. I think the premise is factual, however some of the units/bases/reactions are a bit outdated. But I found the book easy to read, detailed enough to keep interest and looking into some other books by this author."
3,a list of jokes,"i love bob hope hence the purchase of the book...i was disappointed in the fact that it was a small hardcover book, and simply a copy of his jokes for the various times of his life...i believe that very little effort went in putting the book together, and it was a disapointment...find another book to read about this great man..."
1,NOT premium presentation paper as shown in picture!,"OK- I just ordered this paper, but only once I got it did I realize that the title clearly says it is Heavyweight Matte inkjet paper, NOT the 4 star premium presentation paper shown in the picture. While the paper that was delivered says ""perfect for high quality photo reprints and enlargements"", its not! Its perfectly fine as cardstock but horrible to print photos."
3,Wanted More,I'm a hopeless romantic and this book left out a lot of the romance. It tells how they met then it tells how their relationship goes after they're in love. But it does not tell HOW they fell in love...the little sappiness that makes your heart melt. All that was missing. It was a good book overall but would have been excellent if it had had a little more...about the evolution of love in their relationship.
3,Not entirely sure....,"While my dog LOVES these, I'm not entirely sure how I feel about them. The filling more than likely has some weird stuff in it that I wouldn't want my dog to eat. Then, he loves to chew the bone after the filling is cleaned out, but I'm just too worried that he'll chip a tooth! Not sure I'll be buying any more of these...."
2,Poor packaging,"Gift for my father so I haven't seen the movie. Video quality is OK. Realize that this is a DVD-R. That is fine since it is disclosed. However, the DVD Jacket has NO artwork. It is a white colored jacket. Title is the only thing on the front. Back has a description. DVD-R also has no artwork. Cheap."
3,mwc hard trivia,"I am not necessarily a trivia nut,but I do love this show, but I think the book was ok, but not that great, as some of this trivia is quite hard and I, personnally, did not like the way the book was laid out,but it was fun and informative."
2,A let down,"If you like the game and are a fan. then buy this DVD, but don't expect much because it doesn't explain anything and a lot of things counterdict what is going on in the game. IE the marker size in the DVD compared to the game. And also the fact that they could not come close to the marker in the movie not so in the game. And how the infection got aboard ship. its different from the game to the DVD. I hope the get it together before the next movie"
1,Disappointing Movie,"This was a decent movie that had much potential. However, the best scene was the one they didn't include in the actual movie. They were thoughtless enough however to include the rough draft of it as a deleted scene.This could have been so much better. I doubt I'll bother with the video game because of it."
2,"Come on, how dumb can you get?","Mulla Nasrudin can be a pretty entertaining guy, but in this book the stories are uniformly just plain dumb. It's as though he's operating on another planet. The drawings that accompany the stories are pretty pathetic too. Maybe my mindset is jaundiced, but my father used to tell me Mulla stories when I was a kid and none of them were as off the wall as these."
2,Not worth the price,I didn't really notice a difference when using this product. Would not purchase again. I used this shampoo once a week for four weeks. I have highlights and lowlights. My hair looked the same after using this product.
3,"Solid, but hardly spectacular","Reading all the reviews below, I can see the view of both the positive and negatives. The publisher is Traders Press, who are known for their over priced books, huge pages, fonts and often minimal content. This is no exception. There are 200+ pages in this book, but half of the pages are just charts that may take 3 seconds to look over before moving on. I finished reading this book in about an hour with little effort.I do like Rudd's style, he gets straight to the point with his pattern setups with very simple (sometimes vague) explanations. He uses typical TA that we already know - support, resistance, price targets, open, close, high, gap resistances. Nothing particularly special for an informed trader. I can't say this is a bad book, the price is reasonable compared to a Joe Ross book and a trader may pick up a thing or two that he isn't aware of."
4,Very good,The candy was very good. The only complaint I had was that some of the bars were smashed and could not be given as gifts.
1,Beg to differ,"There are readable comics and then there are the others. Watercolour splashes abound on every page. Whimsical writings and drawings. What more could any poet ask for? However, this is NOT a comic. I defy any reviewer to state the plot here. Not thick enough for a doorstop."
1,Do not order,"I ordered this product on November 20th. On December 26th, I entered a claim and my credit card was refunded.Prior to that the last status from CatsPlay said it would ship on December 20. It did not ship and did not arrive by Christmas.This was a frustrating and disappointing experience. It was like trying to do business with a neighbor who makes cat towers in his garage rather than a real business. I am disappointed with Amazon for having such low standards in selecting vendors.I don't know if it is a good product but with the service of CatsPlay, I guess I will never know. My future pet orders will go to drsfostersmith.com"
5,Good quality bit,"I was skeptical when I ordered this bit as it was so much cheaper than any other 3/4"" rabbet bits I could find. I am totally pleased with the bit. It came very sharp and I cut approximately 100 ft. of rabbets 3/4"" deep and 3/4"" wide in hardwood, which is a ton of waste removal, and the bit held up throughout. I am very hard on bits and take as deep of a cut as I can get away with and it never burned or became dull beyond use. I had expected that I would have to have the bit sharpened or replaced before the task I needed it for was complete, and I ended up not having to because it held up so well. My future router bit purchases will be Magnate."
5,Exactly what I needed!,"Needed this for a Recording Class. Trying to make Recording my career, and so far this book is going to be very valuable."
2,Bad sound,"This is, in my opinion, a bootleg and a very bad one - no matter what sellers are saying. The sound is bad!Still, after a while you get used to it and actually start enjoying it. Some of the tracks have slightly better sound and these tracks show you how raw and andrenaline-filled power Iggy & The Stooges had back in those days. This is not an album for the masses. This is for true fans and collectors only."
3,meh...,"I hate Pan and that effing robot Girru, Gearu, or whatever his name is. This is not Dragon Ball Z. Don't expect the same action and story that Z delivers. Goku's fight with Nova and Ice was good though. Try to borrow GT from a friend who has the set because it's only ok at best. Not worth what is asked for it."
1,If You Want Orange Hair Instead Of Gray This Product's For You,"I've now tried several Just For Men colors. They are all good for a few days, but within a week or two the results are always the same.Copper!It'd be fine if the dyed hair simply went gradually back to gray, but no such luck. As the color fades, orange is left in its place. It doesn't matter if I use medium brown, dark brown, darkest brown, ash brown... Orange, orange, orange are the results. And each time in between i waited several weeks to grow out the previous copper before i planted a new Just For Men in order to grow a fresh crop of orange.Haven't you seen men with copper hair color and wonder why they would dye their hair that color! It's not them, it's the product!This review is for all the men who slink away thinking it must be something wrong with them or how they applied the product. No, no, and no. Should be our response. This product is not the answer for us."
3,"Nice, but color doesn't last long","This is a great color - I have a hard time finding it in stores. Only CVS seems to have the Ash Brown. Walgreens, Rite Aide, Target, Safeway -- none of them carry the ash brown - at least none of the stores near me. The price on Amazon was about $1 cheaper per box than what CVS's regular price is. This is a good color - the ""ash"" in the brown helps make the color look more realistic than the medium or light brown colors. Problem is that within a week, I see gray strands popping up on the sides and top of my head. Ideally, I'd have to use this product every two weeks to stay on top of the gray. I use a shampoo that is formulated for color treated hair, but even still, the color just doesn't last anywhere near what they say it should."
4,Wonderful but not exceptional,"There are plenty of surprises in this book. You'll read what director Frank Capra and the players themselves have to say about making ""It's a Wonderful Life,"" and you'll discover some interesting names among those who were almost cast. You'll also learn that some of the film's legends are true, while others are not. For example, while it is true that Carl Switzer (Alfalfa from the ""Our Gang"" comedies) was the rascal who opened the gym floor exposing the swimming pool beneath, it is NOT true that muppets Bert and Ernie were named as an homage to Bert the cop and Ernie the cab driver -- that's just a coincidence. In spite of the book's rather crowded layout and lackluster production, if you love ""It's a Wonderful Life"" and/or if you collect IAWL memorabilia, you'll want to have this book."
1,Surprise,What do you get when you rush a book to press?? A poorly written book for a very difficult test. I took the test and used this book for my first test on the MS 70-223 and I got burned. I then took the test after purchasing the Microsoft Training Kit and had no problems. I had a discussion with the author of the book by e-mail about my first failure. I then asked him two of the questions on the test that I did not understand. I got an answer back that pretty much said that he did not know the answer. Exam Crams are usually great. Do your self a favor and save the money for the Microsoft Training Kit. You will be better prepared for the test if you do.
5,Underappreciated!,"It's sadly shocking that after all these years this book hasn't gotten more reviews than this! It's a truly amazing piece of art and literature the likes of which set story-telling and visual feasting on a whole new level. I don't equate it with Dinotopia because it simply surpasses it, hands-down. On every page a full on treat for the eyes, a story suspensefully compelling. There are literally thousands of species of animal detailed with the highest regard not just to anatomy, but behavior and fantastical clothing.I can't spout enough about the lavish images. The story is also one to pull at the heartstrings and make you really think about society (as an adult) structures and people, albiet told from the eyes of animals. This book is so overlooked, apparently, and I have been trying to get everyone I know to get a copy of this book. It's nothing short is epic and should be in every library! Both for children and adults alike!"
1,7 Wires!?,"I bought this wire set for my 96 Neon, i finally get it and it has 7 wires in the box for a 4 cylinder engine....not only that but none of the wires had spark plug boots attached to them and only 2 of the wires had angled wires you know from the distributor cap. I don't know if it was an amazon mistake or an manufacturer mistake but i wouldn't recommend these wires."
2,it was okay,a bit too small and the binoculars are too hard to see. it does keep the bug in but i wouldn't recommend it.
1,Buy at your own risk,"I bought this mother board (MOBO) in August 2007, the item arrived very fast (a good point for the seller). I dont have much experience with retail MOBOs but as soon as I got the box I noted that the board is just put inside it, there is nothing to prevent that it suffer if the box received a hit. It is just inside a plastig bag with the accesories apart. With all this, I was afraid that it won't work. When I assembled the pc it started just fine and I felt fine, but the next day it died, I press the star button and nothing happened. I verified the processor, the hard drive, etc., in another MOBO and everything was fine. It was the MOBO that died. Next time I will buy a ASUS.PS: I live in Venezuela, that's why I can't return the product.Sorry the horrible english B-("
2,Mini Rose and Teddy Bear,"The roses arrived dead, and only one bloom on either of them. Was disappointed with product. Not as pictured."
5,She loves it!,"The perfume gets ME great reviews and she insists on saving those ""beautiful red bottles""."
2,Disappointing at best,"A geographical companion and atlas could be very helpful, but this didn't answer. Perhaps someone else will try their hand and be more successful. The maps are inadequate and omit important and interesting locations. The maps are also rather crudely drawn. The text is unnecessary and silly, attempting to recap each book and at the same time not give away the plot.I can imagine a book arranged as an atlas, with colored detailed maps which include all named locations. Maps with exploded detail would be necessary to show harbors and navigation hazards. The index would include all place references with location coordinates on the maps. Latitude and longitude references should also be included. I'll buy one as soon as it's published."
4,Reformatted version for Kindle - great companion for books.,"The print version of this book is great. The Kindle version used to be unreadable - and the publishers responded to feedback and replaced all the maps with nice scans. If you're reading through the O'Brian canon, this is a great companion to follow the voyages!"
2,Disappointing,"The comparison with Jim Thompson is obvious; one can only assume that was the target Starr was consciously aiming for. I think he falls badly short of the mark. He's got a tin ear for dialogue and with interior monologue he's even worse. That is a major handicap to an author who is describing a descent into madness, and at the same time it is precisely what Jim Thompson excelled at. Further, Starr seems to lack a voice of his own. It seems impossible to consider the book on its own without comparing it to others in the genre. Overall it is a very forgettable book."
2,"Weak, Bland, Poorly Written","This was the first book I've read by Jason Starr, and I'm sorry to say that it disappointed me on every level. First, the writing was weak and amateurish. Second, the plot--an average guy gets so fed up with the stresses of everyday life that he finally snaps and goes nuts--just didn't work for me. The main character's problems really weren't that bad, and even the one ""big stresser"" that suddenly pops up in his life just wasn't integrated into the plot in a realistic manner. Last but not least, there wasn't a single likeable character in the book. From the whiny, mopey main character to his bitter, shrew-like wife, the obnoxious co-worker, the always-angry boss, the sleazy new friends, there wasn't a single person in the book to feel sorry for or care about. I had higher hopes for this one, and it really let me down."
2,Disappointing,"Having just read the author's ""The Pack"" I wanted to try another of his books. Unfortunately, the lead character in this book is the same type of loser as the protaganist in The Pack. The exception is in the former book, the character overcomes his problems, much as Jack Nicholson does in ""Wolf."" In this book, the main character never recovers and spirals ever downward."
1,Unsafe Material,A sticker on the packaging clearly stated that the potty material includes a known cancer causing agent. I sent it back to Amazon immediately. My daughter was very disappointed because she loves Dora!
5,NOT WORTH THIS PRICE,this is a good book but a book with 151 pages and from 1964... this is not the right price you will never sell it
2,Totally dead after 2 months,"Well, I got this product as a gift, and it did work well for awhile. One day, about 2 months after I got it, I plugged the thing in and it just wouldn't turn on. I should've sent it back. What can I say, I was busy, I didn't have a receipt, I really wasn't thinking about it. I never dropped the thing, and I even opened it up to see if it was a busted fuse or something. Now I'm sure the warranty is expired. Sad thing is is that I can't even find any info about it on Toshiba's website, it's as if the thing doesn't exist to them.So it's a neat concept, DVD/VCR, but buyer beware, it might fail after a bit. Maybe I'm a victim of planned obsolescence gone awry."
4,Very good but predictable ending,Brilliant writing as always but disappointing ending & some predictable sections of the book. Have read many of Martha's books & highly recommend them :)
4,"Good Work, Lacks Integrity","Very well done chap. Probably could not have done better myself. There were some soft spots in it which caused me to look at it poorly for a moment. If I weren't so nice, I might have given it a 3 star rating. Don't get me wrong, it was well written and I enjoyed it dearly. I do rate books rather harshly sometimes. Only cause I want people to understand that they and we or all of us can do better."
2,Awful camera,"I got this camera 4 years ago to photograph my first children being born. I thought the pictures were good at the time, but now that I look back after getting a real camera, I can see how bad the pictures were.All the pictures are grainy, even on a low ISO. Red-Eye is horrible since the flash is so close to the shutter. No Zoom either!Not that anyone would really buy this camera these days, but don't buy this one!"
5,Maybe I'm biased...,"I AM a friend of his :) Normally I don't enjoy poetry, but his is really easy to relate to (especially if your name is Bret Easton Ellis). The poems themselves range from introspective to insightful and if he's lucky, both! As a whole, the collection is wonderfully eclectic and a joy to read."
3,This one had major problems!,"1. These people were all ""St. Claire's"" by blood:TylerTyler's brother DavieBoth of Tyler and Davie's parentsTheir Aunt Matilda and her husbandDavie and his wifeDavie's daughterEvan, the copMaybe it's just me but it all sounds on the incestuous side.2. Tyler's made-up swear words/descriptive phrases were cute, at first, then they were just plain annoying.""Spit and decay"", a ""dipsomaniac, douroucouli on Drambuie"" which I think was a drunken monkey.3. The supposed ""Roman Trio"" was some sort of mafia running illegal gambling in Western NC. Western NC is home to a very large Cherokee Indian reservation, with a very successful, growing legal gambling industry. Illegal gambling would do very poorly in that area.4. The characters were all cardboard and one dimensional.5. There was zero chemistry/romance between Tyler and Evan.Now that I think about it a three is somewhat generous but it's not quite bad enough for a two. Wish we could give stars!"
5,clean white,I recieved this watch on time. This watch is so clean and white i love it. Very simple and stylish. Straps are very comfortable where i can't even feel a thing.
2,Ignore one-sided reviews,"I have found the one-sided reviews on Amazon of no value in selecting a book. Some are laughable. The fact that 100% of people found these reviews useful is even more amazing.EDN writes: ""the elegant simplicity of Maxwell's equations"" - simple? really?A Customer writes: ""If I was an emags professor, I would definitely make this required reading ..."". At what university would this be? Another found the book ""very useful ... in solving some very real problems (e.g. in antenna design/analysis)"" How? Please elaborate.Electronic engineers are unlikely to learn anything new from this book. It contains few design formulas, but is mostly an overview of some principles."
4,Very good review and convincing explanation,"If you are not an expert in Electromagnetics and would like to get a broad perspective of the field without going into complex mathematics, this book is the right choice for you. All the explanation is clear and convincing. You will not feel like you are reading a book, but in stead listening to an expert in RF engineer speaking to you. In addition, you will find the references given in separate sub-topics very handy. They leads you directly to the right books when further knowledge in a specific area is required.(Why 4 stars? Some topics can be given and discussed in more detail.)"
1,Rebecca Ryan,"The choice in tunes is fanatastic but Rebecca Ryan hardly does them justice. The emotion is watered down, her voice sounds like a parody of Marilyn Monroe singing Happy Birthday to Mr. President though a nice novelty but song after song in this style becomes old and annoying. The piano playing deserves 4 stars but unfortunately you are distracted by the the weak whispy voice that lingers much like a mosquito in ones ear. This cd left me craving the talent of Keely Smith, Dinah Shore and Julie London, who are the strong voices usually associated with these great torch songs. Your money is better spent with the originals."
2,fly away flying saucer attack,"Strange music to say the least. Strange not as in wiered, I mean strange as in tons of time and work where put into the washy background guitar-scape with gentle flow, and then dave sings over top of it completley destroying the mood. Dave can't hold a harmony if his life depends on it. He's always of time, and his acoustic pluckings sound worse than a three year olds efforts. How did HE get a record deal when me or anybody else could do much better?"
3,OK for fake flowers,It's a nice decorative piece. I didn't realize that it's not designed to hold water... so can't use for fresh flowers.
1,Worthless and ineffective,"My wife tried Cutter Advanced over a period of 2--3 weeks, and found it to be completely without any mosquito repellent qualities, despite slathering the spray on in hourly doses.Today,I got Deep Woods Off with 25% DEET, and THAT product worked well,no mosquitoes or other bugs even landed on her. I called our local Agway and told them what they had sold uswas useless,the Manager said ours was the first complaint he had heard.However it works for other people,it sure didn't work at all for us. Deep Woods Off 25% was very effective, and next year we'll try the Avon Lady's ""Skin So Soft"" which is supposed to be even more effective. Maybe I'll mix up a combination of that Avon, plus some DEET 100% and REALLY get something worth putting on.."
4,Crossroads of Destiny,Why do things happen the way they do? This book helps identify the significant crossroads in your life as they occur.
5,Definitely a broad range of sound...,"I happened to catch one of the tracks from this album on Pandora and, as it had a sort of Eastern European Cold War spy movie sort of feel to it, decided I had to get the album. All of the tunes are catchy, and each one seems themed to a different location; one has an Arabian or Turkish feel to it, another has a Far East sound, and so on. Volapuk also has a somewhat experimental sound to them, using occasional discordance (violin screeches, cymbal crashes) to accentuate short portions. I like it, but it's not for everyone; one of my friends with more conventional tastes found short portions grating."
5,Good News by Abdullah and Mbizo,"Pianist Abdullah ""Dollar Brand"" Ibrahim series of duets with the late great South African bassist Johnny Dyani captures the energy and virtuosity of first class African and jazz giants conversing in the esoteric language of the ancestors. The album manifests Abdullahs' religious beliefs but do not take away from the music. Abdullah doubles on flute, with mbizo on cow bells, both in vocals call, and Africa answers. True Giants, a must have."
3,Stupidly Happy...,"The title of the second track is an adequate description of this album. This is a decent pop record, heavy on electric guitars, but is put to shame by Apple Venus Pt. 1 and previous XTC works. There are some high quality, infectious pop songs here (Playground, Church of Women, My Brown Guitar), but this record on a whole is still somewhat disappointing. I'd recommend Apple Venus Pt. 1 or Skylarking for the XTC beginner."
3,This fan misses Dave Gregory,"How the times change! It seems not all that long ago that I was rocking my little baby boy to the strains of ""Then She Appeared"", and now he's an 8 year old with a wicked fast-ball and we have two new XTC albums to enjoy. From a long-time late 70's fan, I miss the intricate guitar work that kept this band head and shoulders above the other poppy groups of its time. It almost seems like we have to settle for the easy guitar riffs in order to get to the candy of Andy Partridge's lyrics that we crave. Please reunite for the next one!"
5,Wonderful fragrance!!!!!,This delicious scent is unlike anything available in department stores currently. I was thrilled to be able to find it on line and hope my luck continues indefinitely. Highly recommend this lovely eau de parfum. Only wish the perfume was available as well.
5,Scherrer Cologne,"Scherrer is my ""signature"" cologne. It's not sold in many stores, so I tend to be the only one wearing it wherever I go. If you are looking for a jewel tone scent you might want to give this a try.Their is an asian/eathy ""feel"" to Scherrer. I think that most of the women's fragrances that are sold in traditional stores, i.e., not stores specializing in fragrances, have similar, if not the same base note. It reminds me of the rhyme, ""sugar and spice and everything nice."" Those scents don't have the freshness to them, nor the feeling that you're not just one of a million. To me, Scherrer has the feel that you are one in a million."
2,'The Chick's Inability' To Deliver The Goods...,"Disregard the Product Details for this one, kiddies, as they're outright lies. Which is unfortunate,'cause it sounds like we've wandered into exploitation heaven. Promoted as South American 'PORNOCHANCHADA', it sucks like almost all other 80's soft-core crap available - stick with 70's exploitation if you're looking for something with a sleazy retro feel, or watch Skinemax on satellite for something newer (though that s#*t ain't my cup of tea either). This flick drags like hell - it's like a bad Italian Gaillo, or a Latin soap opera with mild nudity, so don't say you weren't warned. 'Pornochanchada' I don't know much about, but this was as arousing and elusive as 'PORNO-CHUPACABRA'..."
1,Los Angeles Princess with a Tourist's View of NM,"She was banned from the pueblos for things she wrote in this book that offended the Pueblo People. She came here with a time limit. She had no idea of slowly finding her way before writing a book about a subject she knew nothing about. She managed to insult the Indians, the Hispanics, and Anglos whom she professed to befriend. Her predjudices against Hispanic peoples was appalling. Her rude comments about Pueblo women whom she professed to love were inexcusable. She pushed her way into placeswhere she had no business. I found the book laughable, when not offended by her naivete. She is banned from the pueblos of New Mexico as a result of her rudeness. She said on the radio that she is trying to sell this book as a screenplay to Penny Marshall. She should stick to subjects she knows best: La La Land and Gollywood!"
3,Good but not Resnick good,I'd wait for the paperback. I am not disappointed that I read it but it doesn't live up to his other works. There were some short stories in there that were quite good but the book as a whole didn't have as much flow as I expected; I did not become engaged by the characters as much as I expected; and I could put the book down (which I did not expect!).
1,Quite a letdown,"This book shows no trace of the writing that has earned Mike Resnick a Hugo and Nebula award. Dull, repetitious, unimaginative stories about ridiculous one-dimensional 'heros', as he calls them.Evidently a book written for young teens judging from the constant boring sexual fantasies/exploits of the characters. It seemed totally pointless. After awhile, I used it to put me to sleep."
3,the software sucks,99% of the time the voice commands don't work while driving and it gave routing direction going against one-way traffic!!! Be very careful if you are relying on it in an unknown area.
2,Inaccurate Maps,"You got to have both accurate GPS receiver and maps in order to get accurate positions and directions. I believe that the GPS hardware works fine, the maps that come with it is grossly inaccurate. I drove around my neighborhood, it showed that I was driving way off road over other people's houses in certain sections of the road.The user manual does not list MS Streets and Trips as one of the support maps. I guess I will have to live with the DeLorme's own."
2,Not very good,"The GPS works great. The software is difficult to use, voice commands do not always work and if you make a wrong turn it does not recalculate. I would not recommend buying this product. Software has too many bugs."
3,"Good, but not the best","i've used this a little on the mac... quality wise, it isn't that great. I get better quality on the camera on my cell phone. i can't get more than five frames a second, even though the box says 30. the web cam is really lite, so i'm gonna secure it with string... or tape soon... if you need a webcam and are hurting on money, i recomend this item. but if you have the money, get a firewire camera... or something usb2.0"
4,For Brave and Iron-Stomached Readers,I read this book in the early '80's and I still remember the queasy feeling it gave me. It's an oddly powerful book that can do that and it's unique in my experience. It's not for everyone but the power of the writing and the evocation of a life are certainly worthwhile for courageous readers.
3,Not for serious UV viewing,"The light, while neat, is not for serious applications. It's great for small jobs, such as identifying counterfeit bills, but that's about it. The UV LED is very dim, even when shone at items that fluoresce.The pen is great if you don't get a lemon.I've purchased this pack three times. Once for myself, and two other times for my brother and dad. My pen's felt fell apart within several normal uses, and ran out of ink fairly quickly.My brother's example, however, is great. It's ink is plentiful and it's nib is solid.All in all I would recommend this, but only for those who either need a good UV ink pen. If you need a UV flashlight I suggest the wonderfulUV-1403: Ultra Violet 14 UV LED BlackLight."
5,Great CD,"This CD is lyrically brilliant delivered with the cool yet passionate voice of Deasy. It is very mellow. Check out his Gathering Field CD's for the same lyrically genius and passionate singing but with more rock and energy. Latest is called So Close to Home, but Reliance and Lost in America are all awesome. Deasy is one to watch with the best stuff ahead of him."
3,Not to good,"So i did my research on this product, wanting to spice up me and my bf sex life. Although he enjoyed it and said it felt like ice, the taste was unpleasant and i didnt feel anything, and the product was messy."
2,Boring movie even for this die hard fan!,"The first half hour was pretty good, but the movie got progressively more dull and boring as the rest of the 2 hours dragged on. The men, with the exception of Big, were reduced to cameo appearances and the ladies are getting a little too old for the sophomoric escapades in the movie. Samantha, at 52 (Kim Catrell being 54 in real life), is getting too old to play femme fatale while Miranda and Charlotte complain how motherhood is soooooo hard while both of them have live-in nannies and Carrie, after 12 years, needs to leave the whiney crap for the angst ridden 20-something year olds. This movie will do good for the first few weeks, but as word of mouth spreads; the revenues will stop. No hope for a SATC 3 after this turkey. Better they should have a prequel, set in the 1980s, with a group of younger actresses. Avoid this one and wait for the video, but I know you won't."
3,Not the SATC you fell in love with,"As a die-hard fan of the show I went to see this movie. I hope they let this show rest in peace and that they don't plan to butcher it worse with a SATC3. Much as I disliked this, I'll still buy the dvd but for once I'll wait on the price to come down. It was nice to take a peek at the characters again but it was more like all the same people were playing different parts."
1,terrible 2's is more like it,they should have stopped at the first movie. i always loved S&TC but they have taken it a step too far. i could barely stand to watch the movie. i love the series and characters but there was nothing of substance or drawing me into this film at all. i could not see myself watching this movie again.
1,This mess was NOT Sex & The City,"Terrible from start to... middle. I only lasted about 40 minutes before giving up in absolute disgust.Culturally ignorant, CHEAP, vapid, crass and utterly declasse. This ""film"" transforms what was once an audaciously intelligent and sassy series into a revolting caricature. So bad is it that I won't squander precious words in attempting to describe the repellant nature of it all.In short....UGH!"
2,Dvd,The item arrived quickly but the disc was loose in the case so it earned a few scratches in transit.
2,Not good,"I'm a huge Sex and the City fan, I loved the first film and expected to like this one too, but I don't like it that much, I found really disturbing and dangerous the publicity it makes (through one of my two favorite characters) to Suzanne Somers' hormone theory (or un-theory, which is what it, in reality, is), I'm really, really disappointed, I'm not giving it one star only because the other parts of the film aren't too bad."
2,A Let Down...,"I kept hearing bad things about this movie and that is what kept me from seeing it for so long. I was at a Blockbuster kiosk the other day and it was only $1 so I decided to rent it. After all, I loved the series and the first movie. I should have listened to everyone I talked to about this movie.IT WAS HORRIBLE! So bad. Oh, man was it bad. The only thing I found funny was when Charlotte said something about not wanting to lose the nanny.The movie went by so slow and I was thinking ""when will this be over!?"" throughout most of the movie.Too many bad puns. Jokes fell flat. And I didn't really like any of them. They weren't themselves. I'm just going to act like this movie never existed."
4,Not as Good as the First,I bought this for my GF and she tells me it wasn't as good as the first. I tried to be supportive and watch it with her but I ended up sneaking off to play video games! ;D
3,Not as good as the first,This movie was not horrible. It was decent. I don't know why when there is a sequel it will come out very quickly after the first and is poorly written. If there is to be third movie for this I think I will wait until it comes on cable
3,not the biggest movie of the year,"I love the satc series but this movie certainly lacks its main background character which is new york! its sort of ridiculous to see the money overflow in this film, i liked it better when it was less dresses and more plot...at least its entertaining!"
4,"Fun, but SITC1 is better","It is always great to visit the SITC ladies, but the first one is still the better movie of the two."
5,Lady C gives it 5 stars,Love the girls and the movie. I like that they include details of each of the lady's lives. The scenery is beautiful.
5,The Critics Don't Know What They're Talking About,"Yes, this movie is for fans of the series (I've watched the entire six seasons about a dozen times). It's a wonderful homage to the series and to the unforgettable portrayal of the friendship between these four women. It was so fun to see all the references to situations from the series woven into the story. It was like a trip down memory lane yet it progressed the story of the friendship between Carrie, Miranda, Charlotte, and Samantha in a very funny way. After all, SATC has always been about friendship. I think Michael Patrick King is brilliant, and I'll never tire of the girls. I want more."
3,Cute!,"This was an enjoyable film. The first movie was much better, but this was pretty good. Good charachter development as well as wonderful costumes and good storyline."
1,disapppointment with price,"thought amazon had the best pricing for dvds BUT after receiving this one yesterday, went to walmart today and a big display of this movie for $15.00..guess i will wait and look there next time before i order from amazon"
1,Utter Dross,I would rather burn my eyes out with a aids infected hypodermic needle while listening to justin bieber than watch this crud ever again. Someone please put these poor dogs down.
2,So sad,"Stick with your memories of the series and first movie. This is not worth viewing, Carrie becomes such a hateful selfish witch, it's painful to watch."
1,Terrible,This movie is terrible from beginning to end. None of the characters are acting like themselves. It was very long and very boring. I was actually surprised it was this bad. There wasn't any good music besides the beginning song. I have the first movie on DVD but the 2nd one is just a waste of money. Soooo disappointed.
1,Doesn't work with my computer,"I currently use a PS2 mouse with a sieral port adapter. Which is the way it came, giving you the choice of using a PS2 port or a serial port. I use the serial port because I do not have a PS2 port on my computer. This Labtec is a PS2 and I assumed I would be able to use with the serial port adapter as I do with the one I have now. The instructions say you do not have to do any installation for this mouse. Just turn your computer off, plug the mouse in and turn your computer back on. I did this and I get a message saying the computer can not find a mouse. So is that because the mouse I received is defective or is it because this mouse won't work with the adapter. I haven't had the opportunity to have someone else check it out on their computer, so I don't know."
3,Ok,"This product is good. The only thing I wish I would have known before purchasing it is, the grey risers do not have a middle section so its not like you can use those as separate steps from the blue riser. The are merely for raising the blue riser only which is ok for that particular workout that is included with the high step. If I would have known they grey risers do not have a middle to step on, I would have gone with something else."
5,Great stepper for Mike in Nome,"The stepper will be great for exercise here in Nome, AKToo much ice and snow for outside walks.The stepper is what my wife and Ineed and it meets our expectations.We are satisfied customers.Mike Cusack in Nome, AK"
3,Boo amazon Yay product,"I bought this item with the understanding it was new. I read the reviews and one person did state she received a product that was used. I know you can buy new and used items so I just brushed it off. I paid for a new item and got a used one. I could have paid less if I wanted a used item. It's not all tore up, it looks as if it had been used a handful of times. I only noticed becaused the top step had something on it and didn't look clean so I turned it over to look at the bottom and you can see it has been used. I'm just mad at the principle of the matter. I made a choice and I paid a higher price by choice. Nothing against this product. I like it and i will use it. It's amazon that I'm dissappointed in."
3,Sturdy but too small,"Although it is sturdy, the size is too small if you use side step exercises. It is well made. Dimensions should be clearly identified."
2,"I didn't realize I was getting a ""square deal""","I had no idea this step was a square instead of the usual rectangle! I am extremely un-happy about this. I am a personal trainer with a lot of clients that are obese or elderly and they need that extra space on the step in case they have balance issues when they step up. I read all of the reviews before I ordered and am very surprised that no one else had an issue with this. I just thought the picture had been taken from the end of the step. I will not be returning this because I will need steps for other client's that are more stable, in which case these will work... Perhaps it mentioned something about it being square in the companies product overview, I admit I just read the reviews of everyone who bought it, but I am still un-happy. It was delivered promptly and I am pleased it came with a DVD."
4,Very good,I actually bought this stepper to use in conjunction with my weight training. Quality of construction is excellent and the adjustable heights feature is a definite plus.
4,Polygyny in our Future?,"I found ""Why Sex Matters"" by Bobbi Low a worthwhile read. It was both well grounded (fully a third of the book is devoted to references, notes, glossary and index) readable and convincing.Having previously read ""The Evolution of Desire"" by David Buss, ""Making Sense of Sex"" by Barish & Lipton, and ""Sex on the Brain"" by Deborah Blum, I wasn't expecting much new material from Bobbi. I was pleasantly surprised. One topic I found particularly interesting, if somewhat disturbing was her discussion of polygyny, and the factors that influence the choice between polygyny and monogamy. Monogamy is pretty rare as in most species where the female can raise her young alone she usually does so. So should the family values folks campaign against equal pay for equal work? Perhaps. But one of the factors weighing in on the other side is the increasing investment required to ready children to be a success in our modern world."
2,I never finished,"There are two problems with this book. Low is not a particularly good writer, and is highly repetitious. She is interested in ""proving concepts"", and the nature of the proof is often correlation: the concepts make sense, and correlation may be the best available evidence, but it does not make for a very compelling read when combined with Low's writing style."
2,Bought for a class and then never used it.,"Title says it all, really. The only reason I'm not mad about it is because it was so cheap on Amazon. I was also able to sell it back to the book store (for like $1. CHACHING)"
4,Cool blues rock,"Came across these fellas by chance. It's got great blues rock sound, with good guitar slidin'. Sits in my car cd case - perfect for long drives. Certainly worth a listen & I'm sure you'll consider buying."
3,"Not that great, but does the job","This product is really not that good or exceptional, but for the money, it will do the job against heavy bags."
4,Good gloves,These gloves are good for practicing boxing and martial arts.I use it to practicing Muay Thai and are great.There are just one thing that I dont like it about them: In the thumb has a hole where the finger is show it. It's ok but I prefered the another ones where the thumb is hide it. Anyway it's ok to punch the boxing bag and practicing some martial arts.Everlast is always synonimous of quality.
2,WATCH OUT!,"Not until your set is delivered will you realize that Act IV (the part with Elena) is missing!URANIA should have announced this in the front cover, not only in the back cover, which was not showing on this site.(See picture of the back cover that I uploaded)Conductor VITTORIO GUI is excellent as usual.Orchestra and Chorus from Opera di Roma are also first rate.BORIS CHRISTOFF plays BORIS CHRISTOFF as usual, but as Mefistofele, he sounds even more exaggerated than usual.GIACINTO PRANDELLI as Faust is excellent as usual.ORIETTA MOSCUCI is the most awful Margherita I've ever heard.PIERO DE PALMA as Wagner, and AMALIA PINI as Marta are very good.Surprisingly enough, the sound of this studio recording is very good."
5,AWESOME NINJA MOVIE,"This movie is a must for all ninja movie fans ,one of the best more modern ninjamovies .Great visuals,this is a very well done movie based in historical truthbut spiced up for film . This is not the cheesey type ninja movie that most peoplethink of that came out in the 80's era.Do yourself a favor and pick up a copy ifAmazon ever carries this title again ,otherwise it is worth the hunt."
5,If you don't have this one yet...,"If you're a Zellar fan, this CD is a must. If you aren't a Zellar fan YET, here is a great place to start! The live CD offers a snapshot of the unique musical energy and general goofiness that characterize Martin Zellar and the Hardways at their best. This one has a good mix of songs that will satisfy the ""daddies"" fans (with the exception of those who can't live without ""Zamboni""), those who love the new stuff, and those begging for great covers that only Martin and this band could deliver. Here we hear Martin Zellar's amazing lyrics come to life with the personality of the Hardways and the excitement of the local MN crowd. Along with Nick Ciola and Dan Neale, the new CD features Scott Wenum on drums and vocals. This is the only project so far where you will hear Scott's drumming styles (minus the cowbell) and hear his conversation-stopping voice on supporting vocals. If you can't make it to all of the live shows, get the CD and pretend you're there."
2,sleeper,"CyberTiger has no excitement. I was expecting booming tee shots and Tiger's excitement in golf, but this game has put me to sleep! Graphics aren't bad, but the excitement in the game isn't there."
3,Good but basic,The book is a good way for students to review their basic facts. Since it says grades 4-6 I was hoping there would be more complex multiplication and division. Outside or a few pages most are basic facts. I would say suggested grade levels 2-4 instead.
4,Good game for online experience,"I bought this game exclusively for playing online. The actual game experience is very good, however I rated the game overall at 4 stars because of network issues that continually pop up online. Online play is frequently interruped by ""network errors"" in addition it is not easy to set up a server to host online play.That being said, if there are no errors, the game is great. Voice communication is clear, and the graphics are good. In addition there are may opportunities to play different characters. It is not simply a ""shoot em"" game. I love the opportunities to parachute, drive jeeps/tanks, fly helicopters, etc. In addition the playing venues are large with little risk of going ""out of bounds"".Enjoy!"
1,The worst Blu-Ray I have seen,"Take a public domain print, cut off the top and bottom, and filter and smear all detail out of the image and you've got this Blu-Ray disc. A major disappointment and worse quality than the out-of-print SD DVD release."
5,Knitting Color: Design Inspiration from Around the World,"This is an interesting book. I like it because it takes ideas from what we see around us. We are different from each country -- only we are the same as each other., Thanks for a great book. Patterns given and the colors are wonderful. It makes the imagination start to flow."
1,not the one,"Dr. Pagano is right. But don't take our word for it. Just a simplea/b comparison with the same cuts on the new Phil Spector Retrospective(excellent) not only reveal these versions to have been remastered into oblivion but that a layer of echo has been added, all apparently to make a more ""modern"" sound. Yech!!! See for yourself. I wish I could recommend this since a few of the tracks I really like here are not available elsewhere that I know of, but this is not the one!"
1,Great Artist and Songs - BAD quality,"All Ronettes fans are familiar with the track listings and the group here, but the ""stereo"" sound is transferred from vinyl and in some cases is very tinny sounding. In addition some of the tracks,most notably ""Best Part of Breakin' Up"" are OBVIOUSLY SPEEDED UP. How the bootleggers could do this without thinking a Ronettes fan would not notice is beyond me. I mean I have nothing against bootleggers but if you're gonna do it, do it right."
2,Misled,It really sounded like a cheap bootleg copy. It would surprise me to hear that The Ronettes actually released this.
3,Amazon you are so lacking...,"Did the Ronettes just come out with a new compilation? If so, where is it? Why does this COST SO MUCH? Oh because there is just ONE (& it is used). Try stocking the new product for a reasonable price. And please spare us the $30.00 used CDs in the future unless it is the Beatles' Butcher cover"
5,Cable management,Gosh they really hold speaker cable in the wall when nailed in. Oh and they are white (to match my wall).
4,helpful just for few months after C section,be very honest i start to follow this workout Video after 3 months of my C section because i feel that its best to rest for at least 6 to 8 weeks. c section is major surgery so its better to be very careful with exercises you do first few weeks.over all i feel this video is good for few months. after that you feel you do some thing more challenging. i don't find result very good but its good for beginners. i like Tracy Anderson workout much better and you will see result but be careful with her Abs workout very hard to do so its better to follow Jennifer for 6 months after that switch to The Tracy Anderson Method: Post-Pregnancy Work.
1,not the mugai ryu I know,"I bought this book because it is quite rare to find any book in English on the subject of Mugai Ryu. I have a specific interest in this school of Iaido which I have trained and studied together with Muso Ryu Jodo in Japan. Apart from the historical errors described in one of the other reviews, there are also quite a number of inconsistencies with the kata I know.If the historical accounts are not correct and the technical descriptions of the movements differ from the actual Mugai Ryu kata, I wonder what the purpose of this book is, and indeed why anyone would consider buying the book."
2,Not one of their best,"I love this band, but this was not one of their better offerings. There a couple of good songs you won't find anywhere else."
5,De Burgh's Finest Hour,Chris De Burgh is a gifted musician. He entertains you through his music while at the same time makes you contemplate religious issues that most of us think about but never verbalize.
2,Generic At Best,"This seventh book in the now stale Net Force series offers nothing new and is better left alone. The Net Force series started off fresh but the books have since grown forced and clichéd. Writers Perry and Segriff seem to still follow the same plot blueprint that most of the books have followed: ruthless bad guy with a diabolical scheme (even though we never learn what it is), a lowlife assassin, a new set of net viruses (a requirement), and Net Force saving the day. At least in this book the writers decide to change the status quo a little in the ending and provide a jumping-off point for bored readers.There are a wealth of better alternative books: readers looking for military/political thrillers should check out Tom Clancy's REAL books, while readers wanting action/adventure should try Clive Cussler's writings, and readers looking for future/tech should try some of William Gibson's books."
3,"Not the best, but a fast read","I have to agree that this book does not live up to the expectations of anything associated with Tom Clancy. The book was a fast read for me. I agree a lot of the computer stuff is fantasy at best, with a little too much Virtual Reality [...] involved.The entire book would probably take only 30 minutes in a film. If you like the Net Force series, you will probably like this one too, but if you are a Tom Clancy fan and have never read this series, be warned that it is not written by Clancy, and that is quite eveident."
5,"Gentle, but Penetrating.","Read this, then find all of David Richo's books.Top quality, fast delivery, great price. It is amazing how convenient it is to buy such worthwhile books, and, unlike a library book, you can keep these purchases for future reference and make notes right in your books."
4,extremely enlightening,"I was inspired to read this book by the other comments that I read here and I feel compelled to write my own also. This is one of the most beautifully written books about relationships that I have ever read. For me, at this time in my life (almost 50) it was very poignant and spoke to me at a very deep level. The author writes in such a gentle manner that you feel as though he takes you on a journey of spiritual self discovery. He made me aware of many aspects of my inner self that I was previously completely unaware. It is a very worthwhile and growth producing book for those who are ready to hear what he has to say."
2,Disappointing,"Okay - I only managed to read the first chapter and then skim over the following two because this book is really badly researched despite the author stating that she has spent many years researching the topic.My first impression was that it was almost identical at the beginning to Tom Cowan's ""Fire in the Head"" to the extent of quoting the same quotes - but who copied who??Conway's recalling of even some of the basic Celtic myths has a lot to be desired - even her version of the ""tribal invasions"" appeared to have various errors in it (and I have personally researched and written about this topic myself!!).Overall extremely disappointing for what I read of it. Research is questionable - there are many better written and better researched material available."
1,Fiction,"""Modern Celtic Shamanism"" is a myth. Most books claiming totell about ""Celtic religion"" and Celtic ""magic"", includingthis work of fiction, are full of inaccuracy, fantasydisguised as historical truth, and items that have beenproven time and again to be completely false."
3,Strange sizing,"I'm a long time boot and Frye wearer. I'm used to buying a larger size than I actually measure; it seems to be the nature of boots. I measure 8-1/2. After a return and reorder, I'm currently up to a size 10. They fit, with a great deal of struggling, and very tightly. Because of my history with Frye, I'll hope that they 'break-in' comfortably. I might try a stretcher. Seems light a huge discrepancy in sizing."
1,GET SERIOUS,"With over 15 years of experiance and up to date on all of the new product lines as well as the upper level machines, I must say that this book isn't worth the paper it is printed on. Most if not all of the information contained is readily available from the manufacturer of the appliance. If you have a more serious problem with your machine then you do in fact need a technician to inspect it and give you the options to repair it CORRECTLY or to purchase a new machine. Put your dollar to use and hire a real professional, with real, in the field experiance."
1,Curious? Save Your Cash!,"Being an appliance repair tech with over 15 years of REAL field experience, I can say the info in this book is at best common sense and at worst just plain wrong. Save your money to spend on a service call to have a real professional service and maintain your appliance."
3,average performance ease of use,"these would be perfect if the stick didnt needed any drivers but i have to carry around their Cd or another thumb drive with the drivers, performance is not so great range either. the computer to computer feature works fine"
1,Worst GPS I have seen,"I got this GPS in June 2008. It is very slow catching the signal and very hard to follow the directions. For every exit automated voice mentions to be on the left. I generally don't try to write bad reviews unless the item is horrible. One positive aspect is JVC customer service has done repairs and sent me back while I complained. Even after the service it's slow but works better. Invest your money on Mio, Magellean or Garmin. I used these 3 brands and they are pretty good."
2,So...where's Will's voice?,"First, I am a die-hard Will Oldham fan. So it disappoints me greatly to say this CD is a self-indulgent throw-away. There seems to be only a couple of different songs here, played over again with only a slight change here and there. Sorry Will:( But I still can't wait for Lost Blues 2."
5,Track listing...,"Tracks...1. Hay Ride2. My Home in Pennsylvania, (Welcome to)3. Sweet Home Indiana4. Parson5. Graeber Be Good6. Y2K Crash7. Wear Black8. All Right Cow9. Amish Man10. Donkey Walk11. What If Tom Was One of Us12. Parson Klaus Is Coming to Town13. (Untitled) - (hidden track) (song is ""We Are An Irish Band"")"
5,Concepts of Biology,this book came in on plenty of time. it is a good book. has everything i need with it to help me with my class.
3,Clamps,I ordered these to modify them and help me load my kayak on top of my SUV. They must be positioned perfectly or the suction cups will not hold but if they are they work good.
1,Contributing to our moral decay,"Although Klein's novels have been praised for being ""realistic"", they fail to encourage correct behavior and rather paint a beautiful picture of not so beautiful lifestyles. Pre-marital sex, and sex among teenagers, even inappropriate relationships such as the one in this book of a married teacher with one of his students in the name of ""love"" is glorified rather than condemned. Abortion is portrayed as being just another daily happening in this book, and no consequences to badly made choices are ever presented. I fear that books such as this one are the forces degrading our teens and helping them to justify wrong choices that they are making rather than helping to teach moral values and the difference between right and wrong."
2,"so-so instruction, OK exercises",The exercises are OK for tennis but the instruction is only so-so. I found some of the exercises too hard and some too easy and the stated modifications were not very understandable.
5,Very Good General Refence,"Very descriptive, very thorough survey of mass spectrometry science and instrument types. Scientific principles of ion sources, mass analyzers, and output spectra are well illustrated and supplied with chemical equations. The book also has sections on biological macromolecule analysis, and a brief chapter on analyzing spectra output. It also has a section on multiple reaction monitoring for tandem mass spec.This is an excellent go-to-book for getting background information before approaching a problem. I used this book frequently while writing a lengthy thesis/report for my Master's degree, during a HPLC-MS technician internship, and I still to use it today.The writing is concise and descriptive, though at least an undergraduate background in physics and chemistry is necessary to get the full value of the book.I highly recommend this book for undergraduate and graduate students, and for professional review."
3,Best with V&A's Fashion in Detail Books,"Since other reviewers had remarked that many of the photographs are in b&w; and are very small, I worked my way thru the book with my copies of V&A;'s Fashion in Detail (17/18th and 19th Century) and my Janet Arnold books and found this to be quite satisfactory, albeit a bit tedious.The book is 176 pages long and is a paperback worthy of V&A; (the binding is good, the colors are as good as a printer can get, and the paper is good and heavy).The chapters are:IntroducitonWomen's Dress before 1900 by Madeliene GinsburgMen's Dress by Avril HartWomen's Dress since 1900 by Valerie D. Mendes (which ends in 1983)Accessories (small discussions by various of the staff)CatalogueThe stength of the book, for me, is the Men's Dress discussion and catalogue, since men's dress is rarely covered."
4,Another Stockwin home run.,"Stockwin hits another into the stands with his latest in the saga of Thomas Kydd's Royal Navy career at the time of the Napoleonic Wars. Plausible, very readable and addictive. Keep them coming Mr. Stockwin."
2,You would have to have been there,"Buy earlier books by this author before this one!!! I picked up this book in complete ignorance of what or who this is. Don't repeat my mistake. I stumbled through it in total confusion but with a feeling I was missing something worthwhile ... so I researched the book, only to find that this is one of a series of books whose parts no doubt make a whole.So, probably it is true that these books (for children) should be read and enjoyed in sequence. Out of sequence, this book was a little too obscure for my taste. Unless, of course you like feeling just a tad stupid."
4,"A Puzzle, Not A Novel","I should warn you before you read: this isn't meant to be read as a story. It is purely a puzzle, to give us things to speculate on when we read the Series of Unfortunate Events. It's a fun and funny puzzle, but if you haven't read the entire series it is probably very confusing.Another good thing about this book is that whenever a new SOUE comes out, you can get a new perspective on the book, so it's fun to re-read it. ^-^"
2,Just another way to make money?,"First of all, I must say I love the series of unfortuante events, but Lemony Snicket has gone a little too far. His ""biography"" is confusing and makes no sense! **WARNING** make sure you look through some of the pages before you buy this book. In the table of contents it made it sound like this book would answer all your questions, it doesnt! I was tricked into buying this book by the table of contents. The reason I gave this book 2 stars is because there is a funny parody on the back cover of the book. Lemony Snicket should be ashamed of this book!"
1,A Let Down,"I felt that this book had wasted two hours of my reading time. It was just a collection of letters and documents that made no sense and were unrelated. I would have enjoyed finding answers to the original questions posed at the outset of the story. I am a huge Snicket fan, but this book was rather disappointing. Although I liked the reversible jacket and the intriguing comments by Snicket, I didn't think the book was worth reading. I didn't put the book down because I thought it would all come together in a strange way at the end, but it never did."
3,Daughter liked it,"Really getting tired of buying these throwdown books by the author, but my daughter ""has"" to have them all or be left out I guess."
4,Snickety Snicket,"Any fan of Lemony Snickt should buy this! This is definite hilarious. However you have to be a true fan to understand. My daughters like ""A Series of Unfortunate Events"" so of course we had to get this too, and we've enjoyed it mostly."
3,Umm..........,What a life that Lemony Snicket has. I loved the format of this book. It was like a newspaper artical at first. I didn't think it was that interesting. I mean peoples lives are interesting its just i couldn't get into it. I love all of this other books just not this one. This book tell about the life of Lemony Snicket.
1,Insufferable,"For reasons I cannot explain, even to myself, I actually finished this book. Oh, I had to scan over some of it, but I read it only because I so admire the Baudelaire orphans saga. Anyone expecting this bogus autobiography to be in the same vein is doomed to utter disappointment.Why? Because the book TRIES to be funny. It tries very hard to be funny, grunting and groaning and acting silly like a twelve-year old boy trying to impress his little girlfriend with his manliness. Just as the hobbledehoy is not manly, this book is not funny. I'd like any reviewer who said this was funny to point out a single page that was even vaguely amusing.Silly pictures, inane newspaper clippings, bogus scripts--Lemony should stick closely to the orphans. Very closely. Very, very closely."
1,A Piece of Plastic Junk,"I researched microwaves and read hundreds of reviews before selecting this make and model, only to find that it's absolute garbage. Just one button works (Jet Start). Even the Off button doesn't work - I have to open the door to turn it off. No other features work except the clock. Because it's made of very light plastic, if I press a button or the door latch, the whole microwave slides across the counter. The turntable isn't level so the food moves off-center on it. I'm so disappointed, I will never buy anything by Whirlpool again. I don't know where this was manufactured, but it looks and acts like something built in a sweatshop in a third-world country."
2,Poor Quality,"The microwav was what I expected. Except there were dings & dents on the microwave and, specifically, the stainless trim was of poor quality. I believe this was reboxed by the seller and then sold again as it looked as if it had been a previous return. Either Whirlpool or EvVive, or both, need to improve their quality control.However, it was easy to return and I was told today I will receive my full refund."
5,Avail Eagle shirt,"I needed this for a gift and was able to only find it here. Quick turnaround and i got the shirt relatively quickly. When the person receiving it opened up the package, they were pleasantly surprised! Great transaction!"
2,Not the quality I expected.,"Soon after installing in my street rod, my dash lights quick working. Attached the wire toparking light terminal to get dash lights. Will replace with another brand."
1,Flimsy,"You get what you pay for. I'm not in the car often or for long durations so I just wanted something that would plug in if I was low and give me some extra juice before I got to my next destination. This plug couldn't even do that. Also, it finally fell apart after maybe a month. as in the black plastic housing separated at the seam."
4,Great Grinder,"The Kitchen Aid gives consistent, even results. It did require an adjustment to get true Espresso quality fine (burrs had to be moved closer together), but otherwise outstanding product. Hopper is large. Only a few beans remainunground. Unit is quiet and clean."
5,Great buy,"This is the same KitchenAid Pro Line grinder which sells for $200 if you buy the black or silver one. I have no idea why the red one is less than $100, but it's an incredible deal while you can get them. Even the refurbished red ones cost more than this. I have purchased five so far. It's the best burr grinder I have ever owned. The grinder produces a consistent, smooth grind with minimal noise. It is quite heavy duty and looks nice on the kitchen counter. I highly recommend buying it while they still have them in stock at this price."
5,great seller!,thanks for your great description & fast shipping! we are happy with our purchase & grateful for your wonderful customer service!
1,4 English copies ordered so far - 2 Russian and 2 Spanish copies actually received,!So far I've ordered 4 separate copies. Two have come in Russian and I am also the proud owner of two Spanish copies as well. My fluency in either language is approaching nil.Any advice out there on how to secure an ENGLISH copy? This is all quite humerous really.!
3,Educational and Necessary,"This is definitely a great read. This book is gripping and insightful and there is a lesson to be learned from it. Education kids, I can't stress this enough, life is all about choices and life circumstances and how you deal with them. Great book, great message even if you don't agree with the messenger."
5,Mini-Book Projects for 2012,"I can barely wait for this item to arrive. This year (2011) I have found so many interesting things to help me with my students.One of the things that I am going to use in classroom with my students are mini-books. I encountered some ideas at ""Youtube"", Amazon, and other sites at Internet.I want to bring new materials to estimulate my students, to help and share these 40 easy-to-read mini-books. I am sure we will have a lot of work ahead, next year.When the item arrives I will be able to share my opinion with you. Stay tuned! And, please, feel free to contact me any time to share ideas.Thank you very much for your attention."
3,Good luck!,"Ah, yes - now I remember why I quit Jazzercise after two sessions - there's no basic instruction before the leader is off on some crazy combination of moves. You end up just standing there watching everyone else (who have memorized the moves) work out. You don't need any special equipment for that - just watch ESPN! The actual step product seems adequate, but the video is useless unless you've stepped before. Yes, they start with basic steps (for about 30 seconds), but quickly move on before you even figure out which foot belongs where (remember, they're facing you as you watch them, meaning you have to reverse everything they do). So, buy the step, but find a better video, or keep replaying the beginning of the DVD until you get to square one! Good luck!"
3,DVD didn't match the product,"The step itself is fine, but the DVD they sent me was for a totally different product. It had this really small high step with four risers. It is hard to do the workout with this step. I wish they had included the correct video."
1,I guess you get what you pay for,"This product was much more cheaply built than I expected. It comes to pieces if I try to move it at all and it's too short for me to fit on when laying back to do ""pec flies"" with dumbbells. I'm pretty disappointed. Should have gone with the $90 version."
3,Disappointed,"The four risers do not lock together or to the platform. So, you can't just pickup the unit and move it to another spot without resetting the risers.The box appeared to have been opened and the DVD was not sealed and had a number of minor scratches indicating it had been used. Everything was suppose to be new."
4,Good home stepper,"As many other reviewers have mentioned, this is a pretty small step (about 2/3rds the size of ones found in the gym) so it would definitely be a better fit for a shorter person (like myself - I'm 5'3""), although I find it even a little too short and wish it were slightly longer. Even though it's made purely from plastic, this little stepper is a trouper. It's sturdy and easy to store away. The dvd that comes with it is difficult at first especially for someone new to step aerobics but after going through it about 2 or 3 times, the routine becomes easy to follow and gives a good workout. It's great way to break up my routine cardio and makes for a nice change from power walking and bike riding. Plus it's fantastic for rainy and snowy days when it's just too awful to workout outside."
4,The safe and legal cure for road rage !,"For all those times you've been caught in rush hour gridlock with a road full of indecisive morons; dreaming you could just run a dozen or two of them up on the sidewalk or off of the nearest cliff.....this game....is for you.What a great stress reliever !! Blast into a crowded intersection with a city bus...awesome. Pulverise the driver in the lane next to you until his car flips end over end 5 times and then explodes....yea, take that !! The detail is great, the cars are awesome, the tracks challenging without being too terribly impossible; this game is a great way to vent all of those everyday road frustrations...without running up your insurance rates or ending up in prison. I would recommend it to anyone !!"
3,Buyer Beware,"I have been a long time fan of the Burnout games and this one could have been the best.....but I must say I have put Burnout 2 in a few times since I bought this one....The soundtrack is terrible....The worst of guitar bands you've never heard of....I wish they had left the generic music from Burnout 2 in there..It was much better...I, and many other buyers have been unable to play online at all, regardless of how we configure our ports and firewalls. Rent it, don't waste your money."
4,Very fun to play,Took a while for me to get this game but I regret every moment of hesitation. This game is extremely fun to play. It is almost comparable to the feeling you got when the first time you playedd Gran Turismo! Overall the approach of knocking your opponents out of the game or being knocked out is graet.
5,Sweet...,"This game is amazing. Just plug in two controllers and go away in any mode of playing. This game has fantastic crashes, and effects. Just buy it. I'm sure after looking at these other reviews, you will LOVE it if you enjoy smashing cars ( fake ones or real ;) ) and/or racing games. I am a hardcore gamer, and this is in my top 5 for all time favorite racing games. ( Probably number 2. ) There is only one flaw though.. I don't know why this is, but on two player, there are very few levels.. and when you hit random, you WILL get the same track every time."
2,worst car game ever made,DO NOT BUY THIS GAME the gameplay is crummy the music is crummy the graphics r okay dont waste your money
4,Crash N Burn Return,"It's a great game for $20...putting it simply...you race and you wreck everyone thats racing you...the game would be more fun if you could customize your own cars but there are only preset cars like in all other racing games...the game is a prettey decent length...about the only drawback to the game is the music...only like 3 good songs...like ""I wanna be Sedated by the Ramones""...a plus side is you can always turn off the music"
5,The origins of Germanic tribal naval power and more.,"John Haywood has brought a wide range of resources together to show the development of Germanic naval power from c.200 BCE through the 9th century. While most of his emphasis is on the Saxon and Frankish pirates in the North Sea, Haywood also provides information on early Germanic ships and their evolution.Dark Ages is extensively footnoted and indexed. Included are maps and several drawings.Information on early Continental tribes not found elsewhere in English helps make this a valuable text to anyone interested in the history of the Saxons and the Frankish tribes as well as pre-Viking raiders and ship building.This revision of Haywood's earlier work is by far the best and most comprehensive review of the subject I have found."
4,Prompt and beautiful,My wife wanted this to find a recipe. She found it and now we have added this book to our enjoyable WS collection. Great service from this vendor.
4,Good Bang for the Buck!,"I bought this nailer to re-roof my house...best $199 I have spent in a while. The nailer performed flawlessly except for a few times the collation was bent on the cheap generic roofing nails I bought (did not feed well)...won't do that again. For the money, I was very pleased."
2,Didn't finish 1 roof,"I bought this to roof my own house. It loads easily, it never miss fired, and it never jammed. Unfortunately, it only made it 16 square out of 24 and therefor it does not get 5 stars. Had to go buy $99 dollar gun at Menards to finish. Tool shop gun miss fired like crazy and was very difficult to load."
4,Another good one!,"I liked Leota's Garden, however, it wasn't my favorite by Franicne Rivers. There was a great story line to it. There were a lot of minor details that I wish were answered and would have better developed the characters for me. There were a lot of issues going on and a few untied strings were left. I do recommend reading it though. I couldn't put it down the closer I got to the end."
4,"Forgivness, painful memories and family","I loved the story. Painful childhood memories and the effect it has on our adult life and the need for forgiveness reconciliation. So many times as a child we think and act as a child we respond in a child's mind.Although this story is a wonderful story and I highly recommend it for reading I will tell you do not waste your money on the e-book. The formatting in this e-book is the worst I have ever seen. For the $8 they want for this book, go find a hard cover or paperback. Many of the words are run together, sentences run with no spacing, and punctuation often out of place. All this makes the reading difficult.Buy the book not the e-book.The story is fantastic."
2,"Backup, Short Again","Once again Microsoft has failed the customer. Instead of backing up specific files by choice of the user, Microsoft assumes that we are all stupid. A proper backup in my opinion, would allow me to pick in detail the files that I want to pick. Instead, Microsoft makes that decision in a broad choice and then to make matters worse, backs up the files in code so that i cannot review them at will. This gives the customer only limited ability and control over those files. Whatever happened to making a mirror image that would make sense???????????"
4,great for an at home workout,I do step at a gym and their step is a little longer than the one you get with this. But this is a really great deal for all that you get. I was wondering if anyone knew where you can buy more risers? That would be my only complaint is that they don't have any instruction sheet or any other info in with it.
2,Not the original by any means,I was extremely disappointed as I wanted the original version and didn't realize that this CD was a shorter remix.
2,"This is the TECHNO REMIX version, not the original","******WARNING!!!! THIS IS THE TECHNO REMIX!!!!!******* If you're looking for the fluid version that opens with the Eastern female vocals, this is NOT IT.The more elegant fluid version is off the Brand New Day album, not the album listed by the same name as the title.Cost a buck for me to find that out... unfortunately Opera isn't recognized by Amazon for a lot of their previews so I couldn't listen to it before wasting the buck. And if you're wondering why I'm not using IE, which is what everything is built around, check out the Acid3 standards compliance website as well as reading up on the latest round of security oopses native to IE."
1,I really like..,"the song, Desert Rose, but not the re-mixes in this CD single. Buy the album - the original song is much, much better - I give that one 5 stars. In the Melodic club mix Desert Rose Cheb Mami is drowned out by the instruments at the beginning and that is one of my favorite parts. I think I'll find someone to give this to or donate it to the local library and listen to the full album instead."
3,Good Amateur Fax Machine,"Easy to set up and use. This fax machine does a good job of sending faxes in excellent quality. My only complaint is that when receiving faxes, the quality of faxes this machine prints out is only fair. The print outs are a little faint in spots."
4,ONE SOLID LITTLE MACHINE,"THIS IS ONE SOLID USER FRIENDLY FAX MACHINE. IT WAS EASY TO SETUP, PROGRAM, AND USE. I SUGGEST YOU ORDER ANOTHER CARTRIDGE WHEN YOU ORDER THE MACHINE SINCE THE CARTRIDGE IT COMES WITH IS GOOD FOR ONLY 30 FAXES. THE REPLACEMENT CARTRIDGE IS GOOD FOR 150 FAXES. THIS IS NOT A HEAVY DUTY MACHINE BUT WILL SERVE YOU WELL FOR PERSONAL USE. THE PRINT QUALITY FOR COPYING IS OK, NOT GREAT, BUT PASSABLE. DOLLAR FOR DOLLAR YOU CANNOT BEAT IT. I COULD NOT BEAT AMAZON[.com]'S PRICE."
5,Exactly what I needed!,This product is exactly what I needed in order to start and continue with my personal project. ;-) I recommend using this product on clean skin that was wiped with rubbing alcohol to remove oil and residue.
4,"Great hooks, well made, serve a purpose, but be sure to measure.","Ordered these hooks to use for hanging keys from a small shelf, hanging crystals from beams, and general use. They are well made and quality is consistent. No problems with threads or product. I just wish I considered the measurement was the INSIDE of the hook, so they are a bit smaller than I expected. Overall, I will order again, if I need more hooks."
3,I dont know where to start,"I can't have a go at what he has put but wheres the profound, inspirational information that just wants you to go back for more. If you have read a few self help books you will find this book puts a few together for you but just seems to be more in the summary than the book. A good marketing pitch that didn't live up to the hype but still a book worth reading.Tried to be honest,Steve"
3,Good For Audio Book in Car,"I didn't realize when I ordered this that this was the guy who had the individuals die in the tent at his seminar. This guy is highly motivated but I questioned many of his philosophies. It sounded familiar to the ""Secret"" where if you ask of the universe one will receive. I'm not saying there aren't things we don't understand about our universe but I tend to gravitate more towards proven science rather than the mystical. However, he does hit on some interesting topics and the reader will more than likely feel at least energized after listening to his presentation. He refers to this as a reference or like a Bible that should be referred to indefinitely throughout one's life. I start looking for the cauldron of Kool Aid when I hear that."
5,A MUST-HAVE!,This sheet is so convenient! It is super easy to change the sheet--no struggling with the crib mattress and bumper. I have rotated just 2 sheets for over a year now and they are still bright white and in great shape--even through diaper leaks and tons of spit up. I would definitely recommend buying 2 so that one can be in the crib while the other is in the wash. I have only washed the actual crib sheet one time and I can't imagine having to go through that hassle every time I change my daughter's sheets!
2,Not as great as I'd hoped,"I bought this on recommendation from the book Baby Bargains and I'm not very happy with it. First of all, it shrank when I washed it. Second, the elastic straps that secure it at the foot and head of the crib need to be fastened to the part of the crib that the mattress sits on. If you have a dust ruffle on your crib as we do, you can't fasten the straps without the ruffle bunching up around it. I ended up buying some Carters waterproof pads which are much less expensive and they are working well for us."
3,"Doesn't fit my crib well enough for daily use, but found another use for it","Our son uses the babi italia pinehurst classic crib...bought the ultimate crib sheet for it but it doesn't fit the crib very well. It is good for backup use if my other regular sheets are in the wash though. It just has problems fitting around the big 4 corner crib rails so I am forced to attach the snaps on the regular rails instead which makes the sheet not be able to stretch to look completely flat.Today I just found another use out of it though after feeling that it was a waste to buy this. My son has been pulling up to stand and teething on the top side rails and actually made teeth marks with paint coming off! AH! So I improvised and used this crib sheet to cover the top rail, it fit perfectly in length and snaps perfectly together to stay on. It would have cost about the same price to buy an actual[...] rail cover so it works out. He usually only teethes on 1 side too!"
4,Good product but....,"These only work if you crib slats are a certain size. Our slats are too wide and the sheet would not snap around them. We had to jerryrig the crib by adding plastic hooks that the snaps could fit around. This won't work for us as baby gets older. I do like that the sheets are easy to change, clean well and allow you to keep the crib safe without having to add a lot of bedding. This product works well with the Halo Sleep Sacks."
5,"Great, Great, Great!","I wish I had gotten this 2 years ago. Our little girls mattress is so tight in the crib that everytime that we went to change her sheets it was like a workout. The Ultimate Crib Sheet fits on top of the ""pretty"" sheet so that the ""pretty"" sheet still shows from the sides but the top is covered and easy to get to. I highly recommend this for any parent with a child in a crib."
5,Great Sheet!,"I absolutely love this sheet! Changing my babies sheet is effortless, thanks to this great invention. Just snap one off and snap another one on- so convenient, especially for those middle of the night changes! A couple of my snaps have fallen off over time, but it's no big deal, and the sheet will still work- I highly recommed this sheet to anyone who has a baby!"
5,Awesome product!,"I love it when companies come out with products that truely make life easier for parents. This was great for us (especially during the first year). During the ""baby blow-out"" stage, it is a life-saver!"
3,Does not fit the crib,"I have 2 ultimate crib sheets. The first which I purchased earlier this year is great and fits the crib well. The second which I got more recently, does not fit the crib and is 1.5 inches too small on the width. I recommend this item, but first suggest that you fit it on your crib, before you wash it so that you can return it if it doesn't fit. I suspect I got a bad item from a bad batch."
2,Gave it a good shot,"We used this crib sheet for baby's first 6 months. It's great and convenient to attach to the crib slats. The concept is great and it's easy to use. However, after the first wash, the top of the sheet started pilling. Every subsequent wash after that just pilled even more. Now that our baby (6 months) is moving more and is more aware, I don't want him picking at the pills/lint and putting them in his mouth. I tried multiple times after washes to pick off the pilling and have even tried to use a lint remover in addition to picking each one off with my fingers. Why does no one else complain of this problem? Maybe they changed the fabric used for the top of the sheet? Wish it was better because I would still want to use it. Glad we bought only one instead of two."
2,Concerend mom,"I got this sheet as a present for my first child. I never used it as a crib sheet but as a mattress pad because it seemed inconvenient to change with all the snaps. A friend gave me a crib sheet that is safe and it is so easy to change called the QuickZip crib sheet. My baby can't pull it off the mattress! When I change it, I just zip off the removable sheet and zip on a clean one. No lifting the mattress or bumpers. This is my solution for my child."
2,Poor quality,The sheet started to pill after just 2 weeks of use. Not happy with the quality of this product. You would think the manufacturers would have thought to use higher quality material since babies would be using this...apparently not.
1,Waste of money and uncomfortable for the baby,"it seems to be that my baby wasn't comfortable on it. The cotton layer really doesn't insullate well from the plastic underneath so my baby would wake up with a sweaty spotty back (we didn't find his skin to be especially sensitive otherwise so it's definitely a reaction to this product...) Just to make sure you undertand how your baby feels, think of the hospital beds. They are lined with plastic with just a cotton sheet over them. After a day or so they make your skin itch. This is the same construction so why should it feel any different...It does protect the pretty sheet underneath but why would you even bother having a pretty sheet if this thing completely covers it... Just buy those white & blue sheets that you can use and then toss."
5,Make Sure You Buy This!,"I've been using The Ultimate Crib Sheet for the past two years. They hold up well through numerous washings. I wash them on my gentle cycle and have had absolutely no problems. Yes, the vinyl does become crinkly after numerous washings and the elastic does stretch out somewhat but not to the point that the sheet can't be safely used. The cotton is soft--softer than most crib sheets. The Ultimate Crib Sheets keep your bottom sheet and mattress completely dry, even if your baby has soaked through his diaper and clothes. This is a total God-send, especially in the middle of the night. I keep two on the crib. I just take the top one off and don't have to worry about putting another one on in the dark. Skip the multiple decorator crib sheets and buy this product."
1,BEWARE,This item posses a chocking hazzard. I woke up to my 6 month old gagging on the elastic strap that holds the sheet to the crib. While it may seem like a wonderful invention (oh how i miss it!) I don't think it's worth the risk.
3,Boring,"Neat idea. Although, I thought it was boring, so I wanted to put my sheets over it. Well, it's not possible with the straps. So, I have my sheets over it and it's not attached with its straps. I never thought of leaving the sheets on underneath it to show through the sides until I read a review just now. Perhaps if this was offered in colors as well as just white, it would be less boring."
3,Good product but shipping took over two weeks.,Product is definitely worth the money compared to getting a professional to do it. The company who sells the product is no where close to speedy. Took over two weeks for product to arrive and when I contacted them they did not respond for a week.
1,I don't suggest it,"I followed the instructions to the letter...and it hurts like hell. PLUS, I had a bunch of little bits left after peeling away the ""bigger"" parts, and they are well and truly stuck...even the ""wax off"" that comes in the kit is not getting rid of it. The kicker? It didn't even take off much of the hair. The pain it caused wasn't even worth it if it HAD worked completely properly, so it's definitely quite annoying that it didn't even do what it was meant to do.Not impressed at all."
3,Everything you need,"The kit includes everything you need, and is easy to use (once you get the hang of the wax) Worth the buy."
4,It's OK,"This is my first ""match quality"" ball. One of the reviewers mentioned that the stitching is not visible. That's a *good* thing, since the ball doesn't take up as much water on a wet field (it does pick up some) and it glides faster through the air. And boy does it glide! It seems to pick up speed in the air much faster than other ball I played with. Goalies hate that. This ball is not ""sticky"", so it's not the best dribbling ball around, and you can't bend it as much. My ball doesn't hold the air very well - it needs to be pumped up a bit from week to week. After a year of rather intensive play, it looks a bit more worn out than I'd like, but there are no cuts, so it should last for two more seasons or so. All the ""damage"" is purely cosmetic, not structural. Would I buy it again? For the $40 I paid, yes, without thinking twice. $60? I'd probably look at other alternatives before making a final decision, but don't get me wrong, this is a very good ball."
4,looks a lot better than pictures,"I just got my Grand Stade soccer ball today and it looks ALOT nicer than in the pictures. It looks quite awsome actually. The only bad things about the ball is that it doesnt seem as 'soft' as I thought it be, and I dont see where it was hand stitched (maybe they hand stitched the inside?)"
3,could have been made better,step is VERY long which is a good thing but the quality is not great. the rubber matting on top appears as if it hasnt been glued down right and is bumpy not flat. very dissapointing considering the price!
1,Why>...,"on earth does something like this cost so much?????? It is just PLASTIC. It doesnt take a rocket scientist to create a design for something like this either.Am i missing something? I really enjoy step classes and would love to do it at home w/ a DVD, but WTF????????????????"
5,Molly the train,My grandson plays with this toy for hours at a time. The train was well constructed and shows no signs of failure at the hands of a 2-year old.
3,A little warm,"It does what it is intended to do, protect mattress from wetness. But it makes you sweaty when you sleep on it."
1,NBC is dumb,"I love this show. And I hate NBC for spitting in the face of Apple users by making it impossible for us to buy downloads of this show. Fine, don't sell it on iTunes, but why exclude yourself from all potential customers that use Apple computers? This is why illegal downloading exists... when companies make it too difficult for nice law-abiding folks like myself to pay for downloads. So NBC is dumb, even though this show rocks."
1,Where in the world is episode 6?,"What happened to episode 6 of this show? This is my Thursday night ritual. I need to see this show, I work when it's on!!!! I guess the consumers have to suffer because big business won't given to the writers demands? I don't think they're unreasonable! Without them the networks suffer. Serves you all right you greedy bas*ards!"
1,NBC...why?,Jack Donaghy would never make a misstep as big as pulling this show from iTunes. If only the real NBC execs were as clever as their TV counterparts. For shame.
1,30 Rock has seen many better days,"I'm sorry, but this season is awful. Someone has to say it and I hate that it's me because I love Tina Fey and I loved the previous 3 seasons. This season has very few laughs and it has lost its originality and comedic touch. The characters are the same, the jokes are of lower quality. Nothing happens in any episode. It's like watching extra material that was left out because it lacked substance. The fans will like to watch it regardless of the reviews (like me), but in retrospect this is not a DVD collection worth purchasing. Get the other 3 and let's hope the 5th is like the first 3."
3,Pleasent junk,"I downloaded this as MP3 by accident (you know, can't turn off ""one click"" and themouse slipped while scrolling).It is arrangements of (mostly) common things for violin and orchestra (including, of course, the 24th caprice, which is really for violin solo). Theseare nice arrangements that are easy on the ear. In other words, ""pops""arrangements. Not actually bad (except the 24th caprice, which should sound impossibly hard.)"
1,Misses the Mark,"This is the first review I've ever written. I have to say that I'm very dissappointed with this book. As far as a reference book I think it's good, but as far as a book to learn VB.NET, it's terrible. It spends about 300 pages just talking about general and OOP principles. Then when it finally does get into making programs in VB.NET, it just gives small code ""snippets"". Furthermore, it wastes pages of code showing you how to set properties that can easily be set using the GUI. At the end of the end of the book you're left with a bunch of cute snippets but example of how to pull it all together. This book should really be called VB.NET by ""Snippets"" because as far as how to make a real program that actually does something...there is no ""Example"". If you're new to VB.NET and need something to get you up and going...look somewhere else. I bought the Microsoft VB.NET ""Step-by-Step""...hopefully it'll be better than this book."
1,Bad Book,"This book is a waste of time and money. The book takes 3 pages to tell you to input simple statements. If you want to buy a novel, buy something else that is more enjoyable to read. If you like to read and want to read hundreds of pages to learn a few things about Visual Basic .NET, then buy this book."
3,Really is tiny,"I don't think I was paying attention when I bought this for my niece--but be warned, it is true to it's name, Itsy bitsy. You can almost hide it in your hand. Very cute, though."
5,Wubbzy is always cute,"Wubbzy really can't ever disappoint my child. And it is one of very few kid shows that I find cute to watch. The fall season episodes are especially cute and funny. There are a few episodes that aren't on tv (at least I have never seen them), so that in and of itself made the purchase worthwhile."
5,Definitely palatabe,"My kitty Pluto was in renal failure for 6 months, with low potassium as one of his problems. I decided to supplement with Renal K+ because it also contains B vitamins for energy. Pluto was a very finicky cat and he loved Renal K+ by itself or mixed with wet food."
2,Wrong Cherry Tint,I haven't used this product yet but the cherry color is a wrong match for my Cherry colored Polk Rti series. I wish I had a heads up on this before buying.
3,the jury is out,"I , bought the polk sub with the monitor series frt and rear thinking I should match brands. well, apparently that is not necessary, so after i received the system and set it up I found the polk sub to be underwhelming. granted, i did not spend a lot of time in calibration so this may have tilted my opinion somewhat.It may be suitable for some but i was expecting less of a ""muddy"" sound. Unfortunately, the sub looks awesome with my surrounds, but that isn't enough to satisfy my sensitive hearing. I'm sure others would be happy with the performance at this price range but I returned the polk and am now shopping for an upgrade"
5,"A gentle, warm, humorous teacher of a book","At first I thought I was going to be bored with this book, but about 25 pages in, it got much better and stayed that way till the very end. So much better than I plan on rereading it in the near future!I knew most of the Buddhist doctrine that Bhante (spiritual friend) teaches in his book, but it is ideal for newcomers to Buddhism. All quite clear, quite understandable.The confrontation with the Baptitst minister at Northwestern University was comical. But I was puzzled by the story of the nude sunbathers. I couldn't see what was so horrible about that! It seemed like the puritanism of some Buddhist clergy was coming through and nothing else. Jeez! We live in the U.S.A., as Bhante goes to such pains to point out elsewhere, that we should conform, somewhat. But what the hell is wrong with nude sunbathing?"
2,very hard,I have done pilates for years before I had my baby so I thought this would be a fun workout to do with her. It was WAY to hard! My baby got way to heavy and she was only 5 weeks when I tried to do it.
1,amazon sells garbage,"well everything was fine until i pushed played to watch the movie, i could hear the video but i would not see anything, my tv,and bue-ray are 3d, i dont know why this people from amazon dont answer my e-mails i already told them whats going on like a month ago and still i havent heard anything back."
5,Takes Down The Competition!,"The racing genre is perhaps the hardest for developers to produce good games for. After all, it even seems hard to continuosly innovate a genre that is all about running laps around a track. Thankfully, EA's Burnout 3: Takedown has so much innovation it keeps itself alive play after play.Graphics- 10/10From textures to particle effects, (Which, by the way, are the best I've ever seen in a game) they aced everything.Sound- 10/10The music fits the game perfectly, as well as the sound effects do.Control- 9/10This game has great control, but just not much better than most games. (That is, unless you have a wireless steering wheel)Story- N/AWhile this game doesn't have a story, it just doesn't need one!Gameplay- 9/10My only problem with gameplay is that road rage mode is so fun, you won't play the other modes!Overall- 10/10This game is just different enough to make it a winner!"
5,Awesome Game!,"This is probably my all time favorite car racing game. I LOVE IT! The only one that might be slightly better is the PSP version. But that's because I can take that version with me.But for gameplay on my 55 inch widescreen, this game is bomb baby!Very realistic! I love the custom soundtracks. I love to put in great smooth jazz and 80's hits, while I race around the roads, and run over other cars! It rocks!Buy this game, and enjoy videogaming for life!MC White said: Check it out!!! It rocks!"
4,Carnage is Fun,"This game is for the destructive kid in all of us. It has full, all out high speed action, spectacular car crashes and great team as well as versus play.Make as much money causing mass destruction or win new cars by knocking out the most oppents.Overall a fun game to play."
3,Another So-So Romance,"Hannah Howell will always be one of my favorites. It strikes me as funny that the lead female has ""very long legs, slim & beautifully shaped. (even though she is very short and has on a dress). To give Hannah credit it does say that the dress is old and worn, fitting her snugly. I don't know how you can tell that legs are beautifully shaped while wearing a long dress.The Scottish brogue in this book makes it a hard read. I usually like a little bit of this added but this book is full of it. I also felt like Hannah keeps going around & around in just about every chapter how Maldie will be seen as a spy if they find out she is Beaton's daughter. I never could understand this plot. She wanted the same thing Balfour did - Beaton's death. It never made sense to me why she kept it a secret."
3,Not bad,"This was not the worst book I have ever read, and not the best. The story line was pretty good. However the brogue was ""verra"" strange and I couldn't get over the main character's names. ""Maldie"" made me think of ""moldy"", and what kind of name is that for the heroine anyway?! Balfour also is weird and doesn't make me think of a handscome Scottish laird at all. The conversation had a Shakespearian feel to it as well. I could never get into Shakespeare, thus I couldn't get too much into the conversation flow here either. But, it does start the Murray clan series books, so that's why I read it."
1,I hate books written with a phony scottish brogue!,Why is it that some authors need to make us work at trying to figure out what the characters are saying? I am looking for story to enjoy. A book that I can curl up with. Instead I get a book that is hard to read. Ms. Howell is infamous for doing this. Please stop.
3,Helpful for the Soul Searcher,"I read this book on the recommendation of a friend, teacher and coach during a time when I was off studying about my own spirituality.I was worried at first that this book would be too much overload on an otherwise throbbing mind and psyche, but it wasn't. It was thoughtful, insightful and invited me into the life Elliott leads. Sure, it's about him -- there's nothing that proclaims otherwise!And that's what I wanted to know -- how does this life come about? This healing work? And how do you fit it into your own everyday perception of yourself? And the perception others have of you? More importantly -- does that perception matter?This book truly helped me on this journey of mine and I'm glad it's in my library!"
4,Intellimover transfer your PC Deluxe software,The Intellimover software worked great to transfer my data files and program setting from my old computer to my new desktop computer. I only ran into one problem for which I had to call tech support. The USB drive on my old computer had an old driver and wasn't compatible with the data transfer cable. Tech support told me how to update the driver and then the program worked as promised. It was well worth the money and made setting up my new computer so much easier.
1,Doesn't work with Vista 64-bit,Advertised to work with Vista but if you have the 64-bit IT DOESN'T. No customer support!
5,"Lov'in Him, going higher and deeper in HIm.",Rita Springer is my absolute favorite Praise and Worship Artist. Excellent to pray with. I go into the Lord's presence on the first note played. This is also my favorite album but I like them all.
5,excellent step!,love it! sturdy and strong step... I get a great workout using it. It 's totally worth the money.
5,Just like in the gym,"Does the job: steady, secure and with plenty of stepping room. All you need is some music and to keep moving - step, step, step, step, step, step! Plus the two height adjustments are great!"
5,Love this Bench!,"I just purchased this bench and absolutely love it. It is just like the ones at my gym, is very sturdy, and doesn't take up a lot of space. This is awesome! Well worth the money."
5,It really works!,"I got this stuff yesterday. I've been two days into a cold and was sore all over. In an act of desperation I went to the local health food store and asked whether they had anything that could help with a cold and they immediately pointed to this, and said that it would make me feel better by tomorrow. It's expensive, but I bought it because I wasn't thinking clearly and really needed to get over this cold for work. I was even skeptical after reading the ingredients seeing stuff like VENUS FLY TRAP in it. Nevertheless, I took it, religiously through the night, even though it tasted AWFUL.I BS you not, it works! I'm not completely over the cold, but by god, I don't feel like death and I'm completely functional. Comparatively, I feel like a million bucks. And no, I don't work for the herbal maker company. And due to my initial skepticism, I wouldn't think that it was a placebo effect. I really can't explain it."
5,"Maybe its the alcohol, but it seems to work","OK, like a hot toddy, it's got something like 24% of the hard stuff in it, so maybe that's why it works! Whatever - it just .... seems to work ..."
1,Mother's best interest or childs?,"I have news for Deedra, it is just as humiliating, infuriating, and degrading for a father as it is for a mother. If women spent more time meeting the short and long term needs of their children they wouldn't be so wounded. Mother's start out on top with the legal system and usually end up on top. Deedra and the other women are heard by the legal system even when they whisper. It doesn't need to be a fight if everyone is concentrating on our children. Children need a mother and a father even if those people live in different homes."
1,Not my cup of tea at all,"Over the past years I've red over 300 books on investing, with at least 70 on the subject of technical analysis. One cannot read so much books on TA without ever having heard of the famous Elliot wave principle. I decided to give this book a try, but to be honest I already stopped after the first 3 chapters.This stuff just isn't based on any principles. The author claims to have find some kind of order in price movements, which he tries to illustrate with his wave movements. He goes in great detail into trying to develop a theory on the logic behind these movements. What I missed the most are backtests supporting his theory.He also doesn't hesitate to charge people money selling his wave theories. As if all of that ain't enough, a lot of his predictions on the stock market were completely wrong.Honestly, I don't see a reason why a trader anno 2011 would pick up this stuff trying to improve his/her market skills."
2,NOT ENGLISH SPODE!!!,"I ordered this to use with my Spode Blue Italian dishes, however, it is NOT made in ENGLAND!!! MADE IN CHINA!!! The color is slightly off from the dishes, and not the same quality. beware."
2,Very Disappointing,"I was very disappointed to see the way this book turned out. I've been buying this book since the first edition and I have to say that each edition has gotten progressively worse!This monster is over 1500 pages - way too big to be a good reference. Some topics I consider ""basic"" such as UDFs aren't covered until the Advanced Book. I see this as another money making scheme - put some basic stuff in the advanced book, and make people buy both! Another point that really irritates me is that the tag and function references were pulled out of the book and moved to a CD. If I wanted online docs, I'd just use the ones that install with CF. Not that it really matters in this case as the references in Ben's book have always been almost a direct copy of the CF documentation.The book isn't all bad - there is some new material and good examples that still warrant consideration."
4,"Afternoon Teas: Recipes, History, Menus (Between Friends Cookbook)","Though I have several other books of this type, this is a very nice little book about afternoon tea. I've tried several of the recipes and they were yummy. Interesting information about the tea and the history of afternoon tea. It would make a nice gift to include with a a special tea cup or tea pot."
4,Great home office or small business laminator,"I have had one of these for over ten years. I've used several cartridges and it is still working like new. I don't do a tremendous amount of laminating, but for what I do, it is super. The only minuses I have for it are that it crinkles the laminating if you go too fast or are not careful, and I have to really think when I load a new cartridge to get it right. If this one ever breaks, I'd buy another one in a minute."
5,"So easy, so nice!",I used my laminater for the first time today and was very happy with it. It worked smoothly straight out of the box. I would definitely recommend it. It comes with a 15 ft roll of laminating paper; the refills are 100 ft.
3,Micro Focus COBOL? A little old to be relevant.,"The book truly was in great shape; clean and unmarked. Unfortunately the book was printed in 1982, which I didn't see from the picture. The book was well written and informational but was written for a much older version of Micro Focus COBOL than I had."
2,not pleased,"READ THIS! if you want a review of what i received then go back to the search page and look for the Aegean greek fisherman's cap, because that is what i received. all the reviews for it state it is an ok hat but is not high quality. i bought the Natashas cafe hat because the reviews all praised it's high quality. I AM NOT PLEASED! if i had wanted Aegean i would have purchased Aegean and paid three dollars less. i have already requested either a return or a replacement."
2,Hemp-Choker Necklace,"This choker was about what I expected . It was a gift for my 17 yr old son who thinks it looks good. It is of average quality, fine for a teen."
4,"Ignore the Dumezilian prattle, and you've got a winner.","Pollington does two things that make me very happy. He cites his sources, and he tells you what assumptions he is making. So, it is easy to ignore him when he goes off on Dumizilian-style tripartate healing theory (which is utter bunk).The rest of the book is very useful. He brings together a lot of material that is extremely difficult to track down. His translations are reasonable and accurate, if not inspired. It is well organized, and he gives a lot of context from Latin and Greek sources.Pollington isn't New Age. This isn't some Llewellyn ""how to be an authentic Anglo-Saxon witch"" fantasy. This is serious scholarship. However, it is readable enough to be of use to most Anglo-Saxon reconstructionists, with enough meat to satisfy a true scholar."
4,I really enjoyed this game,"FYI, I'm female and 51. I really enjoyed this game. I just finished and am thinking I will play again as one of the 4 possible characters with different skills. It reminds me of the gameboy 2d zeldas. I've not played any other mana game so I can't compare them but if you are hungry for the old type rpg, this one may fill the need. You can keep playing after you beat the last boss but it lost something for me then so take your time, do sidequests, dudbear jobs, collect gems, enjoy killing monsters. Oh, and stylus use is kept to a minimum which is always a plus for me."
3,not what i expected it to be,"I like the mana series so I got this to play it, but it wasn't what I expected from a mana game."
5,laundry,I make my own laundry soap and this item is a must.Sometimes hard to find in a large size.Great quality item for a lot of uses!
4,Laminating film for 3M DL951,We have been using this double sided laminating paper in our Montessori classroom and everybody has been very happy with it. The quality is great but still a little pricey...
5,Drop in Refill,"I am amazed at how simple this refill is to install in my laminator...just had to drop it into the machine. It produces bubble-free, double-sided laminating with great ease. I will definitely order it again for future refills."
2,Baby food book,My son is a very picky eater so I thought this book might have some good ideas. Unfortunatly he has not liked a single thing I've made. Some things they mention for toddlers I think are alittle too advanced for their taste buds. The first 82 pages don't even have a recipe on them.
5,This is fun.,"Okay the one flaw to this design is that it has a weird skinny metal peg that you insert into the back to use to hold it up on a table or desk. There is no where to store this peg, so if you lose it then pretty much you'll never be able to put it on a table or desk ever again. For instance, transferring it from wall to desk to wall again is going to be difficult without the peg.However, it holds pictures quite well, and is easy to use and really looks nice. The kids drawings have never looked so cool before! And my fridge is clutter free now."
5,Lil Davinci,"The Lil Davinci art cabinet is so clever! It's a nice way to neatly display children's artwork and save the projects, too. The frame and mat are good quality and they match a variety of decor. I only wish my parents had one of these when I was a child. My art would probably be in the MOMA!"
1,"unusual bulb, not available","I have to agree: the bulb is a nightmare! I've ordered many odd replacement lamps on the Web, but can't find one in this configuration (4 pins in a square layout, with no protrusion at the bottom). Even disregarding the ""PL-13W"" marking (which looks like a bulb type but is not) and scanning through hundreds of 4-pin 13W CF bulbs, there's no match; even the base configuration does not appear in charts. Ott lamps use a real PL bulb, which has a standard 4 pins in a row. It appears that the manufacturer got a cheap price on non-standard bulbs.Buyer beware! Tensor, for shame!If anybody knows where to find a replacement, please post that here. Otherwise, this lamp is useless once the tube burns out."
5,3 1/2 Year Old Granddaughter LOVED it!,"I bought the book for my little reader, Olivia. We had so much fun with reading the book together. It is not frightening like many of the old fashioned fairy tales are. I am browsing through Amazon.com to see what else Patricia Seibert has written."
3,A complex novel that fails to deliver.,"Alice Hoffman attempts to combine many elements in this short novel. At the center is the wolf man (Stephen) who is obviously fantasy and a particularly unbelievable one at that. Surrounding the wolf man story line is a multileveled relationship drama. Finally, toward the end of the novel is a touch of whodunnit. The main character Robin is going through a divorce when her life is intersected with that of Stephen. In addition to her divorce, she also finds that her relationships with her son and her best friend become strained when her son begins dating the best friend's daughter. What is lacking in this novel is any type of true revelations or dramatic changes by the characters. In the end, Robin's personality and motivations are unchanged by her experiences with the wolf man and the reader is left unmoved."
5,Good book,"Awesome read, very easy, not too complicated and not very long so great for a nice weekend"
3,Missing something.,"This was the third of Hoffman's books I've read. I'm drawn to her books because of her writing style. Her writing is enchanting and draws you into the books. However, I'm always disappointed by her stories and characters. I think they fall suprisingly short for such a talented writer. As for this book, it was okay. Not something I'd choose to read again. I didn't find it hard to get into, but I think her characters where a bit flat and the story line the same. It felt like there was something missing."
4,deciding who should live or die,"I enjoyed the book. The storyline was good but I thought the characters could have been developed a little more. This is a medical mystery. Cassandra Kinsley, who had been a pathologist resident but had switched to psychiatry because of her failing eyesight, is married to the top heart surgeon at the hospital. Their marriage is getting a little rocky and Cassandra thinks its her fault and then she discovers that her husband is taking drugs to help keep him going with his hectic schedule. To top it off, patients have been dying off that she and her former pathologist partner think is suspicious, but they haven't been able to discover how it is being done, then the pathologist dies after he has surgery and then when she has eye surgery she is almost killed. The book is action packed to the end."
4,More depth than usual,"""Godplayer"" is probably not the book for those that enjoy Cook for his fast-paced thrillers. In this one he takes his time to develop the characters and puts more focus on their emotions and relationships to each other. And, biggest surprise, it doesn't take the usual path of entering the bold knight at some point that rescues the lady in distress. For that Cook has to be applauded."
2,Do Not understand the great reviews?,This is another YA Lord of the Rings knock off. The characters are black and white with good vs evil. I couldn't finish it and only got half way through.
2,A hard read,"I've read all three books and I can honestly say that I'm happy that I've ended the story. On the whole, the story is a good one. Though too orchestrated for it to become the adventure it should have been. The colour was taken away with the lacking detail and the telling of it. The author's third person style grated on me from the outset. I imagined little children sitting around her feet as she told a children's tale, careful not to mention gory details or an impolite word. It is the kind of story where if there was a need for something, voila, it was there. I believe that this story could have been so much more than it was. The characters just didn't get a chance to tell it though.I'm disappointed by the telling the most."
3,Elfhunter,"Ever since my son and I read Robert Stanek's wonderful Kingdoms and the Elves books we've been looking for other indies to read. Elfhunter was one of our most recent picks. In this story, Gaelen and Nelwyn try to defend their people from the monstrous 'elfhunter'. One of my favorite things about this book is that the story has a potential to be epic though it falls short at times and tries to explore too much. The author has a second book called Fire Heart too."
1,Where is the lady grapplers?,"Although the title named ""Grappling Girls Volume #1"", it was very surprising that 3 of the wrestlers were men. As expected these men dominate the tournament. Moreover the final match was between two men. Grappling Girls tournament between men!!!The tournament was divided in two divisions: Light weight and heavy weight. However there were wrestlers who were not fighting in the proper division. There were female grapplers in heavy division that were lighter than wrestlers in the light weight division."
5,It works just great,I've used a variety of different memory sizes and this thing has worked fine. It's great because it's inobtrusive.
4,Good projector,"I purchased a used 3M 9100 for my wife for her craft projects. The projector arrived with a significantly damaged projector head and a twisted and bent projector arm. Surprisingly, the lenses and glass table were intact. Following contact through Amazon, the seller (realfinds) offered to send a replacement unit however I requested just the arm and head and replaced the damaged parts myself (just one screw and a bolt to remove the arm assembly). As for the 3M 9100 - Pluses: The overhead projector works well for our purposes, sturdy base unit and arm, arm pivots for storage, easy bulb changes, focus and adjustments are ok. Minuses: bulky to store, even with the folding arm, no carrying handle, lens mount rather flimsy, hard to access lens for cleaning, middle grade fit and finish. A 4 star product."
1,sent unusable equipment,"On May 12, 2010, I ordered a used 3M Model 9100 overhead projector from Oneil Imports in Carrollton, Tx. - I was so excited and pleased when it was actually delivered On May 17, 2010. We took it up to the church (for which it was ordered), to try it out - and when we plugged it in - and turned it on - were delighted to see it turn on and showed a large lighted square on the wall for our overheads. Then withing seconds of turning it on, it quit running. We tried several times to get it to stay running. It would not. - I believe this to be a defective piece of equipment - I would like a total refund of cost and shipping.This company is not rated by the BBB. And to the BBB's knowledge this business had closed their doors - not so. I would not recommend ordering anything from this business.I tried calling this company - two different phone numbers - both had been disconnected."
3,Smells Great But Should Last Longer,"I hate that they appear to have discontinued these, as they smell great (and I didn't have the musty issue the other reviewer mentioned.) What I especially like is how clean they smell, as opposed to many air fresheners (even other little tree scents) which seem to be masking odor, rather than just smelling clarifying (if that makes any sense.) The real drawback I found was that they don't last long enough...One tree only lasted about two weeks for me (and I don't think the whole ""partial removal of the exterior bag one week at a time"" thing works.) Also, it isn't like I have a strech Hummer or something, it's just your basic Honda."
5,Highly Recommended,"I would recommend this CD to anyone who is looking for a general Latin Catholic CD. The music soars and takes me back in time to the reverence of the Mass, and the focus on what truly is most important. Great to calm the mind and heart and guide in meditation. Especially appreciated are the liner notes in both Latin and English."
4,A Sad but happy ending story!,"Katie is one of the main characters in this book. One day she was walking to school and she saw a dog stuck in a junkyard that was all dirty and very skinny, because the manager never feed him. She was so sad to see this dog suffer so she feed it dinner scraps every day and night and even named it Lucky. Finally she told her mom's boyfriend Jim what was going on with this dog. He wanted to help so they decided to build a dog house for Lucky. They asked the owner if they could put the dog house inside the fence? He didn't mind. They also wanted to fed him every day. Then Jim talked it over with Katie's mother and they decided to move to a country house and get Lucky to keep as part of the family."
3,Good book,"Well after reading another in this series called ""yesterday's Dawn"" I was very unsure of how I would like this book. Well I was suprised.I found that the characters of Falcon a Jaguar warrior who's first wife divorced him after his son dies, and Star a Badger woman who becomes his slave are both strong and emotional. He is fighting the demons of his past concerning the son who was crippled and died and she is afraid that she will never see her people again and wants desperately to have Falcon's love for both her and any children they have.This story is worth an afternoon."
4,great fun,Keep your party or just your friends singing and dancing with these great songs. They won't want to go home!!
4,Pass Port money Case,"The fastener a little disficult to manuever, struggled with fastening and unfastening. Just returned from a European trip, and the money case was needed. Felt secure that money, traveler checks and passport all fit nicely within the case."
4,MUSIC TO DIE FOR,"I watched this video for a school research paper on Eminem's lyrics and how they affect teenagers. I really got a lot of information out of the video and he really had some good messages in it. I really liked the video and recommend it to anyone who is interested in today's music and the impact it has, good and bad."
2,Not too satisfied with this book,"Hi, I am sorry to say that I did not find this book very helpful in any way. I learned very little and most of the things that were shown had very few examples to go by. Real-life problems and situations were not represented. A good portion of the book focused in Windows NT 3.5 which had little appeal to me. For a more advanced user, this book may be helpful, but for a beginning and high intermediate user, this book is of little or no use."
1,was not accurate,Where are the Natives? where are the pirates? this is not an accurate portrayal of colonial life. I bet non of the other reviewers have even read a history book. But these people did not live like this. Roads? where did these roads come from? I can't believe that Jesus is not in a single scene. what a terrible depiction of colonial America. Just absolutely appalling. I will not show this movie to my class ever again. Just plain stupid.
5,Great product for binding cables,"First of all, the vendor ""Cyberguys"" is great. They have prompt and courteous service. They even quality checked my shipment both times! The Velcro is genuine Velcro, holds together very well and is strong.The Velcro straps are great for small appliance storage by binding the folded up power cords. You can bind the strap to the cord first, and then use the strap to bind the cord. Very convenient.They also work very well for computer cord management behind the computer.I also use it for cord management when storing my power tools."
5,"This Yule Log has been ""burning"" non-stop during this Advent season.","We tried out the three ""fireplaces"" available on Amazon Instant Videos, and this one is definitely first place. It runs for two hours, and is an actual burn-down of the logs - with some enhanced flames in the back of the hearth, which the chemistry / physics teacher in our household figured out. There are satisfying crackling & burning sounds, the occasional sound of a burned log dropping. The image is a little blurry, at least on our TV, but we don't mind. Maybe irrational, but we love this one."
5,Nicest fireplace video option on Amazon,"We decided to rent this video when our nephew wanted a camp-out theme for his birthday party. We pitched a tent in the living room and put the computer screen on the floor for the boys to gather around -marshmallows in hand. The rental downloaded and started to play almost instantly. We liked how the fire is set up - not too zoomed in, and with the logs stacked in a space that actually looks like a fireplace. Plus, it started as a large fire, but burned slowly to a soft rolling fire - over a period of almost 2 hours. We turned down the crackling sounds until it was just the right amount for our room. Would recommend for family fun."
5,300+ Ways to Internalize Magick!,"Wow... what fun! I was at a festival where they used this book to make the feast and it was delicious for body mind & spirit. Recipes for every type of dish, with lots of easy stuff for time challenged folk, and other more detailed recipes for those who really enjoy cooking. Great correspondence lists too."
3,A little outdated,"I must confess that I have not gotten very far with this book. It is a really old-fashioned kind of typing book. I am sure it is good for you, but it is kind of like taking cod liver oil. I wish there was a computer version that would do all the charting for you, etc. Also, it just generally needs to be rewritten for this day and age. For example, who needs to know things like the ""Main Parts of an Electronic Typewriter"" and how to load the paper into your typewriter?! The picture for the ""Main Parts of a Microcomputer"" shows a really old style computer with a slot for a floppy disk with no CD-ROM drive."
5,AWESOME!!!!,"This book is ""the bomb."" As is Ms. Vaughn's first novel, Murmur Of Rain, this story is rich with history that moves with excitement as it sharpens your mind while entertaining you. I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It's a shame that there's only 5 stars to give. This critic gives ""Shadows On The Bayou"" a Hot Fudge Sundae with Nuts, two thumbs up with a full circle and 5 out of 5 stars. ***** Bravo!!"
2,Disappointment,"I bought this book from amazon just for curiositys sake. I was pretty sad as it did not hold much of bold scandinavian cooking. Best this book has to offer, at least for me was seared scallops with celeriac pyre and green cardemom flavoured red wine sauce. It was nice. Also the low temperature cooking of salmon is good thing.But seriously these being the nice things is a little too little for me. Okay, I'm a professional chef so I might be a little picky. But I do think that I might have spent my money somehow different."
4,Great Collection - but not as good as Darkwerks,"This is a good collection of Brom's art... but if you are thinking of buying a Brom book... buy 'Darkwerks' before you buy this book.The art in this collection is more mature and refined in comparison with Brom's Darkwerks collection, but is lacking in quantity and the spontaniety of his card art.He is one of the few artists who rarely uses reference material whilst painting. This approach is evident due to the fact that a lot of the figures have comic-book figure proportions -- which is admirable in this day in age where painters trace from photos.Verdict: Buy Brom's Darkwerks first, buy this after.Reviewed by Harrison Chua"
5,Very Nice Old Style Shirt,We loved the vintage look of the shirt. Johnny Bench was one of our favorite players and we love collecting things that represent him.
5,Brand New VS Used,My grandson saw this on ebay and wanted me to bid on it. I did until the action figure price got too high for a used wrestling figure. I checked Amazon and ordered a brand new one much less that what I had bid on the used one.ULTIMATE WARRIOR CLASSIC SUPERSTARS 14 WWE JAKKS WRESTLING FIGURE
4,Like the writer,"My wife liked it and will read more of her books, and she's pretty picky. She reads much more then I do and has control of the kindle now. lol"
4,Loved it!,"After reading ""A Month at the Shore"", I couldn't wait to read another book by this author and I wasn't disappointed!"
3,Dime Store novel,It was predictable....althought it keeps you reading. not really any surprises here....I was ready for it to end before it did.
4,"MTC's ""Holiday Favorites""","You're bound to find some of your favorites among their favorites. A good collection...including their absolute best version of ""Once in Royal David's City"" (a HUGE discovery for me since that's not a title to which I'd normally give a listen)."
3,Very Morbid book,"Not just Collosus dies in this book. This book is full of death of long time x-men characters. As for quality, this book seems typical of the late 90s art styles.I don't know if it was for all of them, or just a defect on mine, but on a few pages there were errors of printing, that the word bubbles on 2 pages were flipped.It's on ok book, but there are lots of better X-books out there. The final issue of the book, with Kitty Pryde delivering Peter's ashes to Russia is 5 stars by itself."
1,Startling terrible,"I can barely slog my way through this book. Heavy on dialogue, light on sense, plot, story. This is the reason that the X-men needed a reboot, which thankfully was done by Grant Morrison and Joss Whedon. This book is a horrific collection of stories written by Chris Claremont, Scott Lobdell, sadly, Robert Weinberg and Joe Pruett, both of whom show much more talent when not doing X-men comics."
3,a fun adventure but not much more,"See the book is a lot of fun, kind of a summer blockbuster of x-men sories, lots of bang, funny one liners, fun characters but mostly is lacking in great story telling, it's a bit short and the new x-men are not fleshed out enough and then they are gone, but overall it's a fu nread, and sometimes thats all you need, i was just looking for a fun adventure with wolvie, cyclops and the rest and thats what i got."
2,A rare miss by Milligan,"If you're a fan of Peter Milligan, as I am, you may want to skip this trade (and in fact his entire run on X-Men). It is nothing like X-Factor/X-Statix, and nothing like his Vertigo work. Quite frankly it's awefully similar to every other X-Men writer since Lobdell that can't really find their own voice and just try to take the Claremont formula and throw some EXTRA angst and in-fighting in. Granted, this story has a reason for more in-fighting than usual, but still... this is merely middle of the road, certainly not as bad as the Austen issues, but nowhere near the level of Morrison/Pak/Whedon and it's really a tame superheros as usual letdown from Milligan, a man who has used superhero metaphor so well in the past."
3,Cute but not very accurate as a time piece,I ordered this for my cow-loving 3 year old daughter and overall she loves it though we did have a phase of fear as well. It's cute and sturdy but it requires 3 'D' batteries and 1 'AA' battery and sadly doesn't keep time well but almost a year later it is still ticking. I do like that it has a light sensor that silences clock at night. A few months into owning the clock my daughter told us she was scared of it but when we tried to move it to another room she wouldn't let us. My 2 year old son likes it as well as long as it's high on the wall and not directly in front of his when the cow does come out (or else he'll freak and cry). Overall I'm happy with the purchase and the discounted price but I won't by buying one of the other versions for my son had I originally planned.
1,Disappointing content,"Everywhere on the net, I read this is the ""service manual"" to have... Unfortunately not enough info for me. I needed a specific tolerance, (end play for rear axle, for rear drum to disk brake conversion) and it didn't list it. I would have passed on it had I known it didn't have what I was looking for."
2,Sets smoke alarm off every time,"Every single time we use this, it sets the smoke alarm off. We aren't sure why. It happens at my home and at my boyfriend's home. It's really annoying. Plus, it's really flimsy so you need to put it on a baking tray when you use it otherwise you might drop it. It's really awkward and I regret buying it."
4,Everything as expected,"There was no trouble with the purchase. The item arrived on time, and in the expected condition. All in all, everything we smoothly."
5,Transport yourself to the Parisian Cafe,"This is an artistic and literary presentation of the Parisian café. The beautiful photographs and matching quotes are an inspiration to the reader who readily senses the author's knowledge of the subject and her devotion to those cafes that were the haven for great painters, photographers, and writers. As one traverses the pages of this elegant, petite volume, one becomes, in one's imagination, a frequenter of those cafes, enjoying their seductive ambiance, while sipping coffee, chatting with artists and friends, admiring the decor without and within, and hoping to find, in this world, a café that can bestow upon him such joy and offer him a home away from home."
5,excellent book,"this book really has it all. I bought this book after reading previous reviews and I was not disappointed. It takes you through all of the silkscreening approaches from begining to end. It also gives you loads of resources for shirts and supplies. It gives alot of advice from the business end as well. My book also came with a helpful DVD. Of all the books that i've seen for sale on this subject, I think this is probably your best choice."
3,"Good book, not enough step by step projects","AS far as Screen Printing: This is good for someone that has some knowledge of screen printing, but not for a beginner, there is no step by step projects. This book has alot of detailed info. But not a book for someone looking to do projects. This book also gives alot of info on transfers and other ways to print. I would of given a 5 star if this book had more of step by step PROJECTS!"
2,Appears to be CENSORED,"According to IMDB, this is supposed to be 93 minutes long. The region 2 version (La Ragazzina) is also 93 minutes long. This one clocks in at 82 min."
2,Worked great for 5 minutes...,Bought this to install Dynamat Xtreme and after 5 minutes the metal portion bent and the roller kept slipping out whenever you gave it some pressure. It is a very disappointing product given the price and the fact that it is a Dynamat product.
1,Not Worth The Free Shipping,"As everyone else found out, the metal parts bend as soon as I started using it. They also pull out of the wood handle very easily. The frustration of trying to install the dynamat with this...er...a...tool (roller would be an over-statement since the thing mostly rubbed the mat down) almost ruined the fun of getting the project finshed. I had to keep straightening out the metal pieces, assemble them with the wood roller, and jam the assembly back in the wood handle, over-and-over-and-over again. Really, just use your thumbs instead if this product. You'll have a better time of it."
4,Yet another interesting Australian film.,"Although the script somewhat concerns discovering a method for controlling the aging process of humans, this low-budget film is most notable for top-flight satirical writing and exceptional acting. Heather Mitchell, a stage trained actress Down Under, is remarkable with her acutely accurate sense of comic syntactic timing. She, along with Geoffrey Rush, much lauded for his performance in ""Shine"", thoroughly enjoy creating their roles. Australian politics, hardly different from any other, are broadly pastiched. The director, Peter Duncan, also scripted and nicely plays a barrister. The plot is wildly improbable but each scene presents something of interest. This little known work deserves a wider audience than it has had."
2,Not Great But Loved,"It's mostly white which lasts about 2 seconds in the yard. It's heavy so it does'nt fly well. It has a strange rim on the botton so the there's even more weight.It does not wash well. The other cloth"" fribees"" are much better.Still my fetch obsessed dog loves it. It could be a tree limb as long as I threw it... Save your money."
4,Good Moneybelt,This money belt does what it's supposed to do. Might be better without so much stretch to the strap used to secure it in place.
2,"cheaply made, buy it at your own risk",Feels really cheap and the belt attaching to it feels like it could snap at any time. The plastic clip looks like it can be broken easily. Should've make it more secure if I'm paying $15 dollars for it.
