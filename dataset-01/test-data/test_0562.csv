4,An intimate album,"First things first: this album will not knock your socks off. There, now that that's out of the way, let's get to why this album is well worth a listen: it sounds like Annie Hayden and friends are in your living room. The songs have a warm, intimate feel that is as comfortable as a pair of broken-in boots. Rock and roll? Catchy pop hooks? Nope. A good listen, with nice melodies and substance? You bet. Intelligent lyrics and nice instrumentation lend it a nice polish as well, though it is not an overproduced piece of ear candy. Give it a shot."
3,Not as good as some of her other albums.,"I bought this album after she performed a few songs at the Mall of America. The songs she performed (""Powerful Thing"", ""WYRL"", and ""TGMB"") were all pretty good on the album, as well.But, the rest of the songs were not as nearly as good. To me, many of these songs were awfully depressing -- and they were so depressing that it gets annoying. It's a change in the wrong direction, I think, since I really liked her songs that dealt with normally somber topics in fun and joyous ways.All in all, it's worth buying. But, don't feel guilty if you don't play it as much as her other albums..."
5,I feel the pain,This got me throughmy bad times when Ileft my boyfriendlike a jerk I was.I feel the pain and it helped me and it will helpyou.
4,More Bite,"This album is a healthy 4 stars. It's stronger than her previous album, Real Live Woman, in that it has some songs with more energy to them, although there's still a fair amount of the low-key stuff too. Good tunes on this one:There Goes My Baby - soft and mellowThat Ain't the Way I Heard It - speeds up, song's about the rumor mill outing her man's activities to herPowerful Thing - has zip and drive, good energy hereWouldn't Any WomanBring Me All Your Lovin- has been done by others, including Alison Moorer. Trish's version is very goodWhere Your Road Leads - strong duet with Garth Brooks."
2,Print Quality Not Great...,"I have now purchased 4 of these cartridges. One did not work at all, and another leaves gray stripes down the page. Quality control must be non existent."
3,"A talent like this needed a bigger book, in every sense of the word","If you dislike small art books, with small images inside, then stay away from this one.SPECIFICS:Page Count: 128Number of images: 128Small images: 65Half page images: 27Full page images: 30Double pages: 6BW images: 0TEXT:1 page introduction1 page introduction to each chapter (4 chapters)3 pages with the index of works1 page acknowledgementsBiography of the artist scattered throughout the book in the form of an interviewTitle, real size and medium used for every piece displayedART:16 images: 5 stars52 images: 4 stars52 images: 3 stars8 images: 2 stars0 images: 1 starOverall: 3,5 stars"
5,Best of the old school detective shows,"It just doesn't get any better than Columbo...the plots are interesting, the acting is great, there are some terrific cameos by various Hollywood stars, it's funny and Columbo's investigative skills can't be beat. My 10 year old son loves to watch Columbo episodes with me and we laugh at Columbo's antics and marvel at his skill. The writers clearly put a lot of thought into each episode as the stories are consistently good. I have watched every episode from all six seasons and I recommend them to anyone without hesitation."
5,Columbo Season One,I am a true Columbo fan. This set of season one DVDs are terrific! They are the original of the series and were worth the money to get them. My husband and I both enjoy classic mysteries and these are no exception. You will not be disappointed with Season One and I highly recommend it for family entertainment.
3,Make Your Marriage Passionate,"I was hoping to glean more for professional development from this book, but it was still interesting. It's a quick read especially if your marriage is lacking in the passion arena. Its not as comprehensive as some marriage enrichment books, but this is because of its focus. If your marriage is in need of more passion, this is for you. However, look to Willard F. Harley if you're interested in an overall marriage book."
3,Interesting but oddly written,"My therapist recommended this book for reasons other than marital issues (I'm single) and it is definitely thought-provoking in regards to codependency and ""keeping the fire alive."" However, I find his writing style unclear and muddled and wish he used more specific examples of his concepts."
2,Weinberg Becomes A Cheerleader,"Unfortunately the author assumes the role of cheerleader rather than an objective observer of Josef von Sternberg's films and life. Although this is an information packed book, Mr. Weinberg unnecessarily attacks other critical assessments of von Sternberg's work. Another disappointing facet of this book is Weinberg's convoluted phrasings and writing style.Certainly the subject matter (von Sternberg) is of importance to film and photography buffs but the reader of von Sternberg's life and works would be better served reading von Sternberg's ""Fun In A Chinese Laundry."" The information contained in Weinberg's book is sufficient for a 2 star rating, but not more."
5,MY WONDER CAKE PAN,"I was looking for a pound cake /tube cake pan. I searched til I came aross this one. Read others review'a & decided to give it a try. I know that you alway's get whet you pay for & believe ME, I got just that. I CAN'T SAY ENOUGH ABOUT THIS CAKE PAN!I LOVE IT!!!!! All my cakes have come out of this pan just Perfect. Want a great cake pan ""Then"" this is the #1 to buy."
3,Light grey. Not silver. with non-stick coating,Based on other reviews I was expecting this pan to look like Nordic Ware's other aluminum cake pans. It is more of a light grey. Not a silver color. I've posted a picture so you can judge for yourself. It appears to be heavy weight aluminum with some sort of coating. I just noticed in the description the pan is described as non-stick. That would account for the coating. I've rated it three starts only because it was not what I expected. I haven't used it yet. I will update after I use it.Update: I made an angle food cake in this pan. It turned out fine but I must say I don't think this pan is anything special. I still rate it 3 stars
4,Favorite candy,"The candy is great, but a little too hard. Other than that we are enjoying it. They shipped it fast and we got it when it was expected."
2,Quite a letdown.,"Most people who buy this single will have already bought Frances the Mute, which has ""L'Via L'Viaquez"" in its complete form. There won't be much appeal in owning the radio version that I can think of, unless you are a completist. The accompanying music video is definitely a trip, but not so much innovative as well-marketed. I don't see as much true creativity in it as I do in the videos of other progressive artists who have attempted to use music videos as a means of visual expression (for instance Tool). As for ""The Bible and the Breathalyzer"", it's essentially a spoken word piece. Interesting, but certainly not a true supplement to The Mars Volta's catalogue of studio recorded songs as it doesn't seem to occur in the context of a particular theme, even that of ""L'Via"" (although this is arguable).In short: collectors and die-hards only. This is not essential material unless you absolutely must see the music video."
3,Feels like a book I would read for homework,"Bechdel's father was an intriguing enough character to keep me reading. Other than that, the story seemed aimless and pretentious. I did not have much interest in Alison's exploration of her homosexuality, and the references to literature and philosophy seemed present for the purpose of the author's bragging rather than advancing the story. There is real shortage of autobiographical graphic novels, but this one is probably my least favorite of those I have read so far."
5,small wonder it won prizes,"Bechdel examines her relationship with her father in the context of the different eras in which they lived---he, during a time when closeting was the only option for safe life as a homosexual, and hers, after the first decade of Gay Rights. That she did this in a graphic novel is absolutely perfect: her illustrations capture the nuance and punch of her text beautifully. Read it!"
5,Funny but profound bookA toyughtfull,Fun Home is both thoughtful and amusing with many allusions literature and popular culture. The simple line drawings are good and add agreat deal to the text.
4,Allison Bechdel is genius,"This book is not a fun read. It can entertain, but for me it brought up those covert creepy memories of growing up with a family. I resonated with this book. It has depth. It's philisophical and personal. It's tragic mostly because of the dissonance each parent has with who they are and who their kids are. Weird as life. Thank you for putting into pictures and words what are the things many of us have trapped in our psyches. Brilliant!!!"
5,What an unexpected treat,"I've never read a graphic novel before so wasn't sure what to expect. I was blown away and am telling all my friends, 'you must read/view this book!'"
4,First Graphic Novel,"I have always passed on graphic novels, associating them with the comic books of my youth. But it was definitely an adult work and rather compelling. I did find it somewhat repetitive. The same thoughts were drawn and written multiple times. It was difficult to read on my Kindle DVX. It looked much better on my spouse's Ipad.Overall its' a sad story of a young girl growing up lesbian with a father who was gay and closeted. The father eventually commits suicide as his world becomes more hostile. I suppose most gay men were in that state in those decades. The basic ethos of the novel was the contrast between her experience as a homosexual and her father's. It made me wonder if lesbian daughters of gay men have a special bond.""Fun Home: A Family Tragicomic"" is part of my suggested reading for a MOOC course, ""The Modern an the Post Modern."""
3,Not for everyone,"I am a fan of graphic novels and this is a very well done example of the genre. The drawings and text work well together and the story line is interesting. That said, it is not for everyone. There are some graphic drawings of lesbian sex and the subject matter is heavy and depressing. I realize the author is writing mostly from a child's perspective but her father's problems extended well beyond being a closeted homosexual. Despite my criticism I am going to read her new book about her relationship with her mother. It's a bit like gaping at a car wreck. You want to know what happened."
5,wonderful!,"This graphic novel is splendidly written and quite engrossing, an excellent weaving of personal history with literary classics. I went to buy this in hardback the day I read the NY Times Sunday review of this book, but my local Borders had to seek it out from the back room. I hope they have since shelved it prominently. I never buy hardbacks because of the cost, but I am so glad I bought this one. I've never read the author's comics or seen any of her other work, but I will read what she produces in the future."
2,better than nothing,"The first 100 pages of this book were fantastic for concepts. After that, there were numerous code listings of various dialects of assembler that were each several pages in length. The premise is that you should learn to read assembler so that you can write better high level code. However, there is no tutorial on what the various assembler keyword instructions mean. This book feels like it was slapped together because it was the long overdue volume two in the series, and has so many references to the first volume that you practically need to own both. There is not enough on Java (or OO in general) as the reader's high level langauge of choice, and far too much on Pascal."
4,Best recording quality in my collection!,"I'm an audiophile and bought this cd because it was recommended by another audiophile friend. He told me the recording quality was top notch, so I bit the bullet and bought this cd. Well, he was right. It is one of the best recorded/engineered cd I have in my collection. The music sounds expansive, dynamic and I use it to demo what a high resolution cd can sound like. This is the first XRCD I have in my collection. I have lots of SACD's and HDCD's. I would definitely try other XRCD's. The actual music I find to be 3 stars. It's a little boring at times, so this cd doesn't get a lot of playing time in my home. Recording quality is easily 5 stars, so I averaged the whole cd to be 4 stars."
3,Ok for reference,"This text makes a decent reference book, but I find that the introduction of new ideas is not accompanied with sufficient explanation or motivation. I find myself continuously refering back to Burden and Faires, ""Numerical Analysis"" instead for more clear and concise descriptions of the same concepts. While our professor required the book for the course (because it is on the book list for qualifying exams), he rarely refers to it. I have accumulated about 5 numerical analysis books now, and I would recommend Burden and Faires, ""Numerical Analysis"" (7th edition) as the best for senior undergradute to 1st-year graduate level, as it has the best combination of theory, explanation, and examples. Stoer presents slightly more theoretical motivation to problems, which I think would be more interesting the second time around, but not as an 'Introduction'."
4,where is this movie??,"i am a huge fan of diagnosis murder, even ordered extra cable channels just to watch this show every week. i was so excited when i saw this was supposedly coming out on dvd. i was hoping since this collection was on its way, that maybe the other seasons would be released as well. i tried to order this every time it was said to be coming out, with no success. very disappointed that it is still not available"
4,Strong Roots,"Heard Laurie and Cary do most of this one live at the Hi-tone in Memphis in mid=March. Bought it on the spot after one of the best shows I've seen in years (second only to Alvin Youngblood Hart two weeks before BM's set). Cary played like a man possessed. Laurie's vocals were superb. (This was the third time I've seen them live -- and no question, the best.) Something about the Hi-tone and Mempho makes musicians shine. Anyway, this is a great CD and has replaced Homegrown as my favorite Blue Mountain effort."
4,Just a plain good movie,"Nothing complicated. Just a a plain, old-fashioned good movie. I liked the movie, but I like all Tom Hanks' movies."
5,Great story,"Maybe it's because I grew up in the late 80s and early 90s - but I really like this movie because of Tom Hanks and Julia Roberts. And there's Fez, so that helped too! Tom Hanks really made you root for him the entire time and made you laugh at JR for her character's eccentricities!"
4,"Entertaining and inspiring, poking fun at recession hard times","Both actors as always earn their wage. Very entertaining, full of quality and spunk. I did however although refreshingly different events happening think it lacked that certain something for greatness but overall was still a nice movie with a somewhat or semi happy ending. They could have tied up loose ends. And its a persnoal peeve when they do that, esp. if there is no sequel. I would have enjoyed them re-writing this a little to give it that pizazz. It had the the making of something great but fell into the definitely decent category (dd). They could have wrapped up Larry's relationship with julia r. and the young female bff more. Seemed like the girl liked him a bit? Idk but I definitley got my money's worth from this film and gladly add it to my movie night recommended list. Thanks. Godbless. Merry Christmas. Praise jesus~shauns movie review"
5,Love This Film,"This was a Wonderful film.A Beauty of a film.This film has the best Cast ever.I'm not a big fan of Hollywood films, I mostly go for U.K. filmsbut this film is Tops."
5,If you don't like it...,"If you don't like it, your to young. Cast, acting, plot, theme; are all excelent. Younger people might not get it because they lack real world experience and anything like a real education or an ability to aply what the've memorizid in a class room to the real world.Screw'em!!!This is a movie for real people who have lived for a while, not snarky high school dropouts!"
1,insufferable,"i was forced to watch about 10 minutes of this waiting for a friend. these communists don't really have much chemistry and the script was thick-headed. from what i saw, at least, i cannot possibly recommend this garbage."
5,Nokia Charger. No ifs ands or butts.,"This is a Nokia charger. Standard stock item. Nothing special about the product. What was special was that my first arrived broken, but the seller replaced it immediately no questions asked. Great Service."
4,Original Charger for my e61,I like this original nokia charger..Very cheap but shipping is more expensive than the original price.
3,Seems to Fit Nicely,"This product seems to fit snuggly into the port. I've purchased three chargers for my phone (E71 Unlocked) in a year and a half and this one seems to work so far. The original charger had a short, one car charger got a short after about year and felt loose and one that I recently purchased which is another car charger and it is loose and has an extremely short cordNokia DC-4 Mobile Charger(although very stretchy, but useless because it pulls out to easy).Pros: Charges phoneCon: Takes up two or three ports on power strip"
5,Capitols Steps keeps on rolling!,"Released in 1990, the ninth album is right in line with the previous eight - outstanding! This in studio recording displays the exceptional talent of each and every member of Capitol Steps.From the first track, Leader of the PAC to the last track, the infamous Lirty Dies, you have over 40 minutes of pure political parody at its very best and brightest. Capitol Steps has once again done an excellent job.Laughing hysterically over songs like Who put the bomb on Saddam Saddam Saddam?, We Arm the World, Read My Flips and others, I can now see why the Washington Post praises them so highly.Grab a copy today and let the laughter begin, you will not be disappointed!"
5,"Beautiful technique, beautiful paintings","This is an excellent discussion of how paintings can be enhanced by balancing opposites (light/dark, up/down, left/right, front/back, big/little, warm/cool, strong/soft, complements, thick/thin, transparent/opaque, short/long, slow/fast, blurred/sharp). The paintings are beautiful and the concepts are worth studying in detail."
4,Great character study!,"This is a terrific book & you can't beat the price.After I read it, I got online and bought the rest of the trilogy."
5,"Brutal Singing, Brutal Beats, ... BRUTAL CD","What Nile is to some fans of Death Metal, Brutal Truth is to grindcore. They are hands down my idols, and this cd brings out the best of it. Not a single track will force you to skip it, and every song will make you want to jump up and thrash every single one of your possessions. And although sometimes the lyrics are indecipherable, they are excellently written, as shown in the cd booklet. Get this cd."
3,FRAGILE PROPS,Really not sure this model will fly for me seems underpowered props break very easy and hard to replace when they do break as other viewers have said.I don't think this is a good choice for any young person without some RC experience pretty fragile and will break easily. I got this for close out price so was an okay deal.
1,JUNK,If you are even planning on buying this product DON'T!!! It is a piece of garbage! My 8 yrs old could have built a better toy. Did I mention it is Styrofoam.... It looks like the stuff your trash form the mailing boxes. And then you also have to by a battery pack that is $30. So you're over $90 and you could have made this product for $10 all together. They should recall this item..
4,neutral taste crackerrs,"The crackers are very good but a bit too sweet. I was looking for a sesame cracker to go with cheese, egg salad, salami, etc. but not flavored with sour cream etc."
2,If only it were satire,"Ms. Klausner's review gave me pause. As satire, this book would have been interesting and would have merited her glowing review. Unfortunately, I think the author was utterly serious with this book. The turgid focus is mindnumbing, without ever being attractive or interesting. The perpetrators of the central mystery are obvious. And yet...Mr. Ryan can write. He held my interest all the while I said ""this is appalling, what a narrowminded, pig"". I would buy a paperback of the sequel in December to see how the lead character changes, now that she is leaving being a tigress behind."
5,Best Boots Ever,"I was looking for a pair of winter boots that would be very warm; but, also somewhat stylish and fun. I definitely wanted a boot with sheepskin lining; but, wanted to avoid the Ugg-style. I also wanted a boot that was cut narrower for smaller calves and that could be easily worn with pants or skirts. These boots fit every requirement. They are the warmest boots I've ever owned. I was able to wear them all day in NYC without ever feeling my toes go cold. I have also received tons of compliments on them.They are also extremely comfortable and they feel almost as if you're walking on foam.The only complaint I have is that the Chocolate Brown color was a lot lighter shaded than I had hoped for. I prefer a really rich dark brown color which this is not.But, if you want to be warm and cute, for the price you can't beat these!"
4,warm,"PRO: Warm and look goodCON: Too narrow for those with large calves, and size appears to be smaller."
5,"Extremely Comfortable, Looks Great, Amazing Price","The delivery was very fast, the boots arrived 2 days after I ordered them. The boots are extremely comfortable. The fur lining is throughout the whole boot making them very warm and cozy. They have a zipper on the side making it easy to put on and take off. They fit perfectly. You will not be able to find a similar quality boot for a better price. I highly recommend Bearpaw boots."
1,"Bo-Ring, Bo-Ring, Bo-Ring","The computer-generated instrumentation just doesn't do Mariah Carey's voice justice here. Every song sounds like the one next to it with a different button pushed.It's a sad state of affairs when a mediocre song like ""We Belong Together"" (whatever remix) is number one for 10 weeks. What does that say about the rest of the chart?Clearly, she has to get a new producer and get away from this paint-by-the-numbers over-researched style and get into music that has wider appeal but with sales as they are, that obviously won't happen. Another victory for the almighty dollar.Maybe even use real instruments and have guest singers who actually have talent.Oh, and Mariah, lose the phony bronze skin color and the front-end augmentation. You don't need it."
5,"Mariah's ""going to get it"" on this album.","This is the trpe of album you play over and over again because it does move fast. Each songs seems direct and to the point, however Mariah pulls it off. I mean we all know she can stretch a note into like 10 but on Mimi she has toned down in many ways(Please note that a toned down Mariah is still way over-the-top)...Lets start with the songs..It's Like That is a true party record ""them chickens is ash and I'm lotion""...We Belong Together is an entity all to itself and this song alone is worth the price of the cd. It's pretty impressive to think that in 2 weeks We Belong Together could become the biggest hit of the 2000's according to Billboard. Mariah also had the biggest song in the 90's with ""One Sweet Day"". Nonetheless Mariah's a proven hitmaker and Shake It Off is no different. Plain and simple, the streets love Mariah's summertime music."
3,little bit thin.,I like the pattern so even I think it is not thick enough compare with my others. Price is OK. i got for ~40.
2,Not very good at all,"I purchase this bar in spite of some of the negative reviews I've read and boy do I regret it. It has a nasty aftertaste and a sort of wierd smell. The first time I ate one I thought it was ok for a protein bar, but I haven't been able to eat another one. I hate wasting money so I'm trying to eat another one now, and it is taking me over 30 minutes!! I will never buy this bar again. It is disgusting!! I have tried many protein bars in the past and this is by far one of the most disgusting even down to the texture. Please don't waste your $$$ on this one.However, the mixed nut and white chocolate one is awesome!! I'm ordering more of those next week."
2,"""Think Thin"" to get yourself through eating one","It may have great protein and be sugar free, but there are better tasting bars out there (I like Pure Protein's chocolate-chocolate chip). The moment I took my first bite I thought, ""Wow, Think Thin must be the mantra you have to repeat to yourself to get you through one of these things. It was so depressing to eat. I'll stick to my Pure bars that also have 20g of protein, better flavor, and 40 fewer calories."
2,"Love the product, but not too great shipped from Amazon","I Like the ThinkThin products and had good luck with a shipment of the peanut butter ones, but these brownie crunch ones arrived in poor condition. From my best guess it looks like they were stored someplace that was hot enough for their chocolate coating to melt. Each one is splotched with white, the chocolate is brittle and flakes off immediately and bears imprints of the outer wrapper, exactly as if they had melted and then re-solidified. They need to be stored someplace much cooler. They tasted fine, but were a huge mess and very unappealing to look at."
4,taste GREAT,When I started eating these I did not even realized that they were sugarless and low-carb. They are so delicious. The only ones I've tried are peanut butter (I like both crunchy and smooth - don't really seem too different).I was baffled to see some 1-star reviews but when I read them I saw that everyone was saying that they LOVE these bars BUT got a terrible quality shipment from Amazon. So I should add that I only buy these in local stores - have never purchased from Amazon!
3,okay tasting...,"I like these bars, but do not love them...reason? They have an okay taste. There are plenty of other bars out there that taste better, but these have decent health benefits over others (like not a lot of digestible sugars) and for that alone, they get 3 stars...."
1,Warning for the weak of stomach,"I am not a regular reviewer, but this product was so awful that I would be remiss if I didn't warn others. The taste is what I suspect compressed sawdust would taste like if it has a sticky chocolate coating. Even my dog - who will usually eat anything won't touch these. If you don't trust me and want to try them anyway, I suggest you order one box only. I ordered four. Guess where they are going?"
1,Melted Energy Bar,"This product was REALLY BAD.When it arrived, after opening one of the energy bars, it looked like it had melted and also had some white fuzzy stuff all over it.YUCK!Because this was so bad, I hesitate to buy more food products from Amazon grocery. I've asked Amazon to resolve this."
2,Waaay too sweet,"I wanted to to like these things, I mean chocolate and peanut butter, how can you go wrong, right? WRONG.These are way too sweet, even with no sugar added, I'm not surprised why. I bought these too eat for breakfast, its like taking bites of a soft sugar bar."
1,Stay away!,I tried a bite after receiving this pack and it was disgusting. I ended up throwing the whole box away!
5,Great Protein Bar,I eat these bars after my workout or for a snack. They taste better than any other bar I've tried and I like that they are natural
1,Two words: Toilet time.,"The brownie one tastes good. The problem is the severe GI ""discomfort"" (to be polite) that follows a few hours later. I know it wasn't coincidence because I tried it 3 different times on random days when I felt fine otherwise. Ex-lax doesn't work as well or as fast as these! Have a thinkThin bar, grab a full magazine rack, and head to the head for some good quality time on the toilet.Enjoy!"
1,Old Product,I've ordered this product a couple of time. Both orders were past their sell dates...FOUR MONTHS OLD. Bought in November product had a July date. Food was discolored. For a dollar more a box you can purchase at TRADER JOE's.
4,Think Thin Chocolate Fudge Bars,This is my favorite flavor of the Think Thin bars that I have tried so far.
1,Bad bars!!!!,"These bars were old and had a really dry taste, and had a grey discolration to the outer of the chocolate. I think they were missing the plastic wrap to the entire box which keeps them fresh. The other box I've ordered in the past had this freshness wrap and these did not. They were bad bars."
2,Not my favorite.,"I'm a chocolate lover, and these did absolutely nothing to satisfy my craving. They have that blah, chalky ""health bar"" taste. Very disappointing after trying their really good mixed nut bars. Won't be buying this flavor again."
1,Tastes terrible,"These tasted absolutely terrible to me. I can't understand why any one would like these. I didn't expect it to taste like a real brownie or candy, but it should at least be edible."
5,Tasty and low-carb/low-cal!,"Individual tastes differ, but I find these bars to be a delicious meal replacement. I've lost 80 lbs over 3 years on a diet which includes these bars (40 lbs in 2012 alone). Highly recommended."
1,Awful,Have tried many gluten free products but these were about the worst ever. Tasted like dirt and consistency of dirt.
5,The only problem is...,"..that you'll get addicted to these and want to put them everywhere. I'm finishing my basement and just installed these over the new 8 ft. bar, and they look AWESOME! Now my builder wants to put a set up everywhere. Super simple to use and they look really nice."
1,Awful: avoid: doesn't even deserve one star,"For starters, the head title ""Mary and Martha"" is disappointingly deceptive: only the last 26 of the some 138 pages of the book are devoted to the stories/characters of Mary and Martha. The earlier pages are taken up with an attempt to construct a so-called ""Greco-Roman"" profile of the social, economic, political etc conditions applicable to ""women in the world of Jesus"" in the first century. Such a profile is assumed to apply to women across many cultures and countries - hardly likely. To make matters worse, the entire book is vitiated by an INCESSANTLY SHRILL feminist voice that twists all to support the feminist cause. And, to make matters worse, it is a voice that speaks in crabbed English. English is not the author's first language, but the editors should have put her English into respectable academic language - essentially a full re-write of the whole. As for the feminism, well ... feminists are often their own worst enemies, as this book evidences."
3,extreme delight,Nice to hear from the talented Mr Cherone again. Title track very catchy. All in all good EP.
3,"Good Resource, but Dense","It's probably a good thing that this book is about the size of a 4x6 index card, as that does make purse sized if you wanted to take it to the market with you. It's pages are stuffed with definitions, pictures and useful tips. To that end, it is a great resource and well worth keeping on hand.At the same time, the pages really are stuffed - compact text that flows from one topic to the next in a relatively small print creates a feeling of claustrophobia while reading and I think that I would have a hard time actually finding what I wanted in a timely fashion if I were using this at the market.All things considered, I recommend checking it out at your library or bookstore before purchasing to make sure it's really the best guide for your purposes."
4,Fun Read,"This book is a fun and interesting read. It covers all meat from beef, pork & poultry to alligator, armadillo, squirrel and racoon. There are pictures and helpful hints. Good gift to give to the hunter/butcher in your life!"
5,A Lovely Read,"This charming vignette of stories will leave you with a new and wonderful perspective of wildlife, as well as a great deal of respect for the people at Wildlife Rescue & Rehabilitation in Boerne, TX. This book is a must read for anyone with a love for the wildlife of these United States."
2,not for man's use,"The armband is pretty, use good and pleasent materials, and it seems to fullfill it's promisses, but the band is not big enough.I am not iron pumper, but a big man, my arm has near 50cm and the band don't fit, It became some kind of elbowband.It is a great product for not so big costumers."
5,Herakhan Babaji is not Mahavatar Babaji,"The reviews of Radhe Shyam's book reveals a serious misconception. Babaji is a common title of respect in India for a realized master. Herakhan Babaji is not Mahavatar Babaji discussed in ""Autobiography of a Yogi."" The Babaji discussed by Yogananda was born in India around 200 A.D. Through the perfection of certain yogic techniques, he attained physical immortality. He taught these to his sister Mataji, so that she too, is immortal. He has never left his body and according to Ram Gopal's testimony in ""Autobiography"", he promised Mataji and Lahiri Mahasaya that he never will."
4,Very nice,"I am very glad that I decided on this case over the few alternatives. It is very aesthetically pleasing and looks very professional. It fits my Vision: W perfectly. The seller I bought it from sent it first class, and I recieved it in two business days.My only problem with the case is the kickstand. I appreciate the idea, but it does not seem to work properly. It snaps back to its closed position as soon as you let go of it, even if the player and case are on the table. The kickstand only proves to make it hard to open the case, as it gets in the way of the strap which must be unsnapped in order to open it.Other than the kickstand, this is a perfect product!"
4,Well Made Item,"Bought this for a 4-day meditation workshop and it was perfect. I love the handle on the zafu, and I would have loved if the zabuton had something similar...maybe even a way to roll it up with a strap or something. It just was not easy carrying it. Overall though, great product and I'm happy with my purchase."
4,Great Watch,"I gave this watch to my husband for Valentine's Day. He loved it. It doesn't look childish with Mickey's hands as the hour and minute hands. The music could be a louder when the button is pressed. If you want a men's watch that's unique and reasonably priced, this is the one for you."
3,GUTLESS WONDER,"I guess I was expecting to much from a mixer that uses 2 AAA batteries. This thing has zero tourque. If you even sightly touch the sides of the glass it stops turning. This thing is only good for frothing milk or fruit juice, a concept I wasn't aware of at the time of purchess. If you add a powder mix to the milk it won't even mix that up well. If all you want to do is froth milk, it works fine for that period!"
3,ok foam... not really cappucino quality,"It makes milk really airy and big- but it's definitely not the thick foam you expect on top of a well made cappuccino. That being said, I haven't found anything that makes foam quicker or easier."
4,Does the job,It works very well for frothing milk for cappuccinos and lattes. The kids enjoy using it for blending drink powders in their beverages. The Aerolatte is easily to clean and store in a drawer too. For the price you can have a couple on hand. I also like that the batteries last a long time especially for how often we use it. I would recommend this product for those that do not have counter space for a cappuccino machine and for those who have kids that enjoy well blended chocolate milk!
5,Froths milk beautifully,I have had a lot of trouble getting good frothed milk with my Jura machine. The Aerolatte solves the problem beautifuuly. I heat about a third of a cup of whole milk in the mocrowave for about 50 seconds (don't lat the milk boil) then apply the Aerolatte. I then add the espresso directly to the frothed milk. Works great!!
5,Amazing Frother,"A little gadget that's simply amazing. It's small, neat and fast. In seconds your milk is perfectly frothed. You have to heat the milk ahead of time, of course (unlike a steam frother), and it warns not to heat to boiling or else it decreases froth. But still, for ten bucks, you can't go wrong! Great for camping (battery operated, included), traveling, or for everyday use. A quick rinse and you're done."
5,Love it Love it Love it - for the price it is amazing,I got this as a gift and thought it was a $50 item. Imagine my surprise when I found out it was $15!Pros:- It does exactly what it is meant to do > makes frothy milk for coffee drinks- It does it fast and quick- It looks just like a professional coffee shop coffee- It is small and compactCons:- If you are not careful you will make a mess !- It is addicting !Highly highly recommend !
5,so far a keeper,"I read the reviews, and I was cautious, but so far it is a neat little unit (a couple of weeks of using it each day). My last frother died a few weeks back, and I wanted a quality unit with some power. It looks like I found it. It is just plastic, but the end is metal, and it has so much power I was able to make some meringue out of an egg white the other day (it takes a really high speed to do this). The unit is very quiet and relatively smooth when it is on. I don't know how long the batteries will last (the directions say 120 uses). It all depends on how long you operate the thing each time you use it. It even comes with a nice plastic case. Anyway, it has been a good unit for me, so far."
2,Dancing on the Bridge of Avignon,"Rosa De Jong is a ten-year-old girl living in Holland occupied by the Nazis. She is a talented young violinist that takes lessons from a man named Mr. Goldenstein. Rosa is a EJwish girl and the kids at her school make fun of her and dont like her at all. So Rosa stays inside and daydreams about all the Nazis disappearing.I disliked this book because at times it got sort of boring. It kind of depressed me because of all the killing, but at other times I liked it because it taught me a lot about the Holocaust.Ida Vos has written other books about World War 2. In which her family was involved. Those books are called Hide and Seek, and Anna is Still Here."
4,VERY THICK WOOL BLANKET!!,"This is an EXCELLENT thick/heavy blanket for keeping off the cold or for using it as a cushion or yoga mat! There is just one small problem, the smell of the blanket is a very strong chemical smell (probably from the color dyes) when it is brand spankin new. I washed it about 4 times before I used it. Washing the blanket also took out a TON of lint and small fibers that would have made for lots of dust to clean."
5,Finally getting the CD treatment!,"I have the Original soundtrack on LP off of e bay. I will have to get a listen to it when it arrives.. The abridged versons are on the LP too... I think that it gives the listener a different view of how the songs could have been in the movie... I might get the greatest hits of helen Reddy here in the future for the pop verson of ""Candle on the Water"".Either way, I am going to enjoy this new CD... Should be interesting to hear what Jim Dale sounds like on CD... At least it is FINALLY being released under the Disney Label... Thanks again Amazon.com for bringing the music of Pete's Dragon Back to the forfront again..."
4,moves air like a mofo and is loud like a mofo,"This thing pulls fresh air through my house and keeps it cool on hot summer nights. If someone is smoking, the smoke goes up and out immediately. Installation is as easy as it can be but does require cutting a large hole, some light framework and running electrical. The sound of the motor is low but the sound of the air movement is loud so I suggest putting it in a hallway or someplace away from where the noise would be a problem."
1,Some Listed Falls are on Posted Private Land,"At least two of these falls, Clifford's Falls and Hulls Falls, are on posted private land and not ok for public access. There may be others as well. The author should get this corrected.Readers should respect landower's wishes and avoid posted property."
1,this blanket is junk,I bought this as a baby shower gift and my sister loved its softness. However the blanket has started to unravel after 1 washing. The company has not responded to my requests for return or replacement. Be wary if you are considering purchasing it.
4,The actual Kew gardens is gorgeous!,"Don't go to the actual Kew gardens during the weekend, it is FULL of screaming children. Aside from that, it was gorgeous and I loved hearing my tour guides. It is a very large place so bring walking shoes and some time. The book is an excellent supplement to the experience, as it lets you see the entire 12 months of Kew. It was given 4 stars because I didn't enjoy my experience as much as I wanted to. They'd make a killing with an open bar, lol, tolerating all those kids."
5,Finally!,I am so excited to finally see a book that backs up my beliefs and shows the Bible advocates not killing & eating animals. I hope everyone reads this book and sees the dangers of eating animals and drinking their milk.Thank you!
1,Disappointment,I purchased this DVD to see Rin-Tin-Tin but he is not in any of the movies mainly because he died before this films were made. Rin-Tin-Tin Jt is the dog start in each movie. This fact was not stated on the advertisement or the cover of the DVD.
4,head cook,I found this produced excellent results. The main drawback to this item isthe pedestal heighth being too short to allow the hand crank to turn freely when sitting on a flat surface.
4,Not a bad deal for the price.,"Be sure to clean this properly before using. I don't think that I did clean it all the way, and the first few pasta strips I sent through had black smudges on them. Also unless you dry it completely, vs. air drying, it will get rust spots on it. It is a little bit of a chore to clean. I tried running paper towel through the rollers and that worked fairly well in drying it and cleaning it out. It did shred the paper towel when going through the fettucini and spaghetti part, but that was to be expected and it got the job done. I would imagine any pasta maker would be equally difficult to clean because of all the hard-to-reach spaces, so I don't blame this brand for that.Other than that, it rolls pasta perfectly. I love that it does fettucini and thin spaghetti. It also rolls the dough out flat enought to make perfect ravioli."
4,It works as advertised.,"I am a beginner at Yoga and so have little experience in necessary products/equipment and qualities. The strap adjusts neatly around my 1/4"" mat with no trouble. I have no complaints in ease of use."
2,Disappointed,"I bought the 84"" yoga mat from the same vendor, but the ""adjustable"" strap didn't fit it. You would think that they would make it to fit all the mats they sell."
5,Wine Country Wisdom,There's a lot of detail packed into this small guide. I liked the winery reviews because they outline what kind of experience each winery offers along with the basics about their history and wines. And restaurant reviews were frank and on the money.
5,This stuff is Awesome,"Please spare me the rhetoric about abortions. That said...I am a 50+ guy that has always had problem skin; oily, acne, rosacea, and numerous other unexplained skin problems. Frankly, I have not really ever done much about it. I have always avoided almost all products, including soaps, as everything seemed to make it worse.I discovered Neocutis products. I now wash my face twice a day with their mild face wash, which is absolutely wonderful. I put on their bio-restorative cream at night, and their bio-restorative cream mixed with some Rosac (rosacea cream with sunscreen) in the morning. At age 50+ my skin has never looked this good or been this problem free.I would highly recommend Neocutis products."
5,Great for sensitive skin with rosacea,"I'm in my late 40's and have very sensitive skin with rosacea, which includes acne even after menopause. This product works great for my skin - no more breakouts and it's helping decrease the lines around my mouth and eyes. I tried using this with Finacea gel, but I broke out less with just the Bio Cream, and it really helps to reduce the redness. It's moisturizing, but not greasy. My plastic surgeon recommended it after a breast reconstruction surgery, to help reduce the scarring - it works well for that too."
5,I love this product!,"I am in my mid-forties and live in an extremely dry climate. This product moisturizes very well without feeling greasy. My skin is soft and looks more supple since I've been using it (about 3 months). It is the only product that I have found that makes my hormone-induced malasma nearly disappear for most of the day. As long as I keep using the product, it stays VERY faint."
4,First prescribed by a dermatologist,I had used Neocutis before. It is a great night cream that I use in conjunction with a Tretinoin Cream nightly. It was somewhat cheaper on line then at the doctors office.
1,too shabby!,This stapler is very clumsy and hard to operate. Very uncomfortable grip and difficult to squeeze without any paper much less trying to use it with papers inserted. My stanley-bostich model ssp-99 is a much better product. Very easy to squeeze even with twenty thicknesses of paper inserted. I would not buy this stapler again. A very poor design!
2,Did the job but could have been better quality...,"This template did the job, but I wish it had more holes to work with. My biggest complaint is that this product is made in a very cheap manner - the template was warped and bowed, it should have been more ridged and straight so it lays flat when marking the holes to be drilled."
1,Uselsss,My hardware was larger than the hole choice; very annoying as I called the company before ordering to check on the sizes--called them twice in fact--and they never answered my calls. So I took a chance which was obviously stupid.
2,to grill or no deal,The only true indoor grill is a cast iron. This grilled nicely before it started chipping and peeling a little. I gave this away to someone who didn't mind the flaking. I ended up purchasing a cast iron grill for all my winter grilling.
5,Great product,"I use this constantly! I'm not all that into using an outdoor grill, so this is perfect! It's just the right size for 2 - 4 pieces of chicken, portobello mushrooms, burgers, steaks and it washes up in a snap."
1,Way too slick/Not enough of a ledge/back wall for the griddle.,"I bought this pan specifically to cook pancakes. On all three times I used it for this purpose, I could not flip the pancakes. The pan is way too slick and the half cooked pancakes slide right off the pan onto the stove. One time it slid and stuck onto the backspash of the stove. Now what are you supposed to do with that? The real problem is there is nothing on the sides to stop the food from sliding right off the pan. It needs a taller ledge/backspash to keep your food in the pan."
4,"Spotlight, Fashion, and Weridos",Paradise Kiss is a fun but odd read. All the characters have certain loveable weird qualities to them. The manga full of emotion and load of crazy hijinks. This manga is fresh and just in time. It has an unique art style with unique characters to back it up. Paradise Kiss isn't for everyone but it's a fun journey into fashion for those who are interested.
3,"Be careful, use it to learn tips for analysis","It seems everyone has a system for beating the market or sell books and newsletters. I recommend learning about investing through the NAIC. It is non-profit, has no agenda and has been around since 1951. Value investing would seem to make great sense in a market that made sense. But we all know, the market does not make sense. Check out the returns on the ""value"" mutual funds before you rush into this kind of investing. Be prepared to read thousands of Annual reports and balance sheets to find 1 company. Values are not as easy to spot as in Ben Graham's day or when Buffett started his investment partnership. The author has good tips for analysis, but don't rush into this method unless you can buy enough shares to put yourself on the Board of these type companies - like Buffett."
3,Could not get it to work but.....,The top of my remote broke so it would not hang from my keychain. I ordered this and it came in the wrong color. I could not get it to work. As I sat looking at it I realized that I might be able to switch the broken case for the unbroken one. Popped it open and just transferred the guts. Now it attaches to my keychain and I have an extra battery.
2,Don't Bother,"While this guide is not a complete waste of time, there is no compelling reason to pay for it. All of the relevant information can be found online at various fan sites. Hang on to your dough and save it for the Rome:TW expansion packs we know will be coming along!"
1,sigh,"This guide is utter piece of crap. 90% of this guide is covered by manual and in-game tutorial. The guide's soldier count isn't even correct. Most of the unit count listed in the guide is half the amount in the game. For example, Hastate is listed as 40 soldiers per unit, but in-game it's 80 soldiers per unit.This is probably the worse Prima ""strategy"" guide I purchased. It's so bad; it prompted me to write my first ever online review. Don't waste your money on this crap. I want my money back!"
5,2nd Volume for Paradise Kiss,"Yukari agrees to model for Paradise Kiss (George, Isabella, Arashi, and of course Miwako) and they begin to work on THE DRESS to enter in the competition. Yukari becomes attach to George in a romantic relationship but knowing George he'll just go for anyone! ;P We are introduced to new characters that are from Ai Yazawa's previous work, Gokinjo. Miwako and her sister, Mikako (she's introduced in this volume) looks exactly the same when in fact, Mikako is much older than her little sister."
5,Curious,This is a wonderful dictionary filled with everything you need to know about the Bible. It has great pictures and is something my husband and I will use alot. We bought one for a friend who has recently become a Sunday school teacher. There are so many things in the Bible that we just look at and wonder what they are. This will explain them to you so you will actually want to find other things that you are curious about.A great book and a great gift for those interested in the Bible.
4,Replacement power supply,Power supply for our Cisco phones went bad and we were able to fine these at a reasonable price as Cisco no longer supports it product.
5,Excellent resource,"Toni Jackson, a well known and regarded breeder-judge in the United Kingdom, penned this book in the 1990's. It remains the only English language resource on the breed, and includes many details on the breed which a person cannot find in web based research in English. Your options to learn about this breed are to learn Finnish, or purchase this book. I am a Finnish Lapphund breeder in Canada, and I suggest this book to anyone who would like to learn more about the breed."
1,Get Your Glasses Out,"I've been thinking about buying this book and finally came across it in a bookstore so I was able to preview it before buying it on amazon.[com] I'm glad I did because like other reviews, the main disappointment with this book is that the paintings are reproduced small. They're reproduced almost as footnotes to the text but my main reason in buying an art book is for the visuals. And with Bosch, there are so many details but they were just too small to see here. The art should have been given a full page without text surrounding an image. This was a big let down, I was looking forward to buying this book, but now I'll pass on it. With the small reproductions it just isn't worth the price. The 1 star is for Bosch's art which is still great despite the poor book design."
2,Disappointing,"This book accompanied a Bosch retrospective in Rotterdam, 2001. It is not a catalogue nor an illustrated biography. It is made up of 3 art history essays (without references) and lots of pictures. The latter are ""OK"" - not more. Many are too small. Most of the captions are in minute type, not helpful in content and sometimes not even near the picture. Some pictures have no identification that I could find. Too bad - it could have been so much better."
2,Lacks Basic Data,"This book doesn't contain the data needed for developing even a simple design for a home water system. For example, there is no data to calculate friction loss from water moving through pipes. The book notes that friction loss is easy to calculate using a table. The book includes a table that lists friction loss for valves and fittings in equivalent length of pipe. But, I can't find a table on friction loss per length of pipe. A third of the book and most of the bibliography is devoted to the author's opinions on water politics, he is no Marc Reisner."
1,Does not live up to it's brand reputation...,"I have always thought very highly of any Scotch Gard products that I have used. Thus, when I was looking for an upholstry cleaner for our fabric covered bar stools, I bought this item. To sum it up in one word - worthless. I followed the instructions, and this cleaner did not remove one single stain. It didn't even make a dent in them. In all consciousness, I cannot recommend this product."
5,Can I really be one of the few who like this series?,"I was shocked at the negative reviews for this book. Strangly, I enjoyed this sci-fi romp. Some reviewers question where the science is: but this whole novel revolves around a rare, generally manually processed, crystal, that is used in Tao space for very very fast space travel. How much more sci-fi can you get? Some reviewers didn't quite like the Dexta bureacracy-yet I think it's a marvelous Machiavellian creation and a nifty counterpoint to an Emperor who holds a lot of power. While it's true there is some sex and details on the skimpy clothing, I don't feel that it is extraneous. It simply clarifies the cultural norms and expectations in the 33rd century. I'm not saying this is some deep 2001 satire on the state of being and the reason for creation-it's not; and CJ Ryan is clearly not trying to go there. But it's definitly a good romp and I recommend it."
4,What makes Avengers great are great writers and rotation of main characters,"For me, first four books of Essential Avengers are better and better. Only Kurt Busiek does superheroes good in his ''Astro City'' title today, but if you want more of the same or to see where it all originated, get all four books of Essential Avengers."
2,More of a commentary,"I found this to be more of a commentary on a dance class. I did enjoy the cane dance that Hillary performed, along with a commentary telling you which steps she is doing. Also some interesting bonus material, so if you do get this, watch the bonus material, too. Good dancer, not so great dvd."
5,"PVD, Tiesto, take note.....","Okay, this is THE tune for all trance enthusiasts. If you like your big, epic, hard trance then you have to own this tune. The P(l)ump mix is amazing, full-on, hands in the air, bring the house down stormer. `For an Angel', `Café del Mar', `Iguana'??? This wipes the floor with all of them.No trancy set is complete without this, the essential dark mix can fit in well but the pump mix will set the floor on fire, come on, bring it on, you love it!"
2,I really hate girl G-Shocks,"I've gotten other G-Shocks for my daughters and they all sucked. They aren't very durable at all. The biggest issue I've had is the small part that holds the band in. That piece always wears out and brakes, so the tail end of the band just sticks out. Also, the little metals wires and the plastic piece on the face will eventually change colors and that bar will start to rust. Thing is, my other G-Shocks for guys are tough as hell and never broke on me. It just seems to be the girl G-Shocks that suck."
1,Desecration of the dead,"I don't know about other people, but when I am lied to, I feel angry and cheated. We were promised that this version would ""set the record straight""; furthermore, Julian Fellowes then appeared on many a talk show junket decrying the inaccuracy of the James Camerons' version ... and then he comes up with this drivel, the errors of which are described on many a website, such as Paul Lee's collection of gaffes. Fellowes is described as a Titanic nut (he provided the foreword for the new edition of ""A Night To Remember"") and wrote the scripts over an 18 month period, so how can he have made so many glaring errors? Did he do any research at all? I am not blaming him for the film restarting from scratch on every episode, as this was the decision of the producer, but for the writer to populate the ship with caricatures of real people, or by people with whom this reviewer felt no empathy (Paolo and Annie possibly excepted) I felt this Titanic was doomed like its namesake."
1,"Not very good, unfortunately.","I was so excited when I heard about the new 'Titanic' TV-Series. With all the new information being released, I thought that this time the film would be based solely on facts. Unfortunately, the film was a disaster. It made everyone who sailed on the ship look like miserable, stuck-up beasts. There was hardly any truth to any of it. I would not recommend this film if you are looking for something to give you true stories of the Titanic."
3,Not as good as I expected,"I ordered this for my grandson who still wets the bed on occasion. Of course in order for it to be comfortable to lay on (as advertised) it must be placed on the bed with the flannel side up. Once it gets wet at all it must be washed. After the first washing the edges curled up and it would no longer lay flat. I hadn't even dried it in the dryer, but let it dry over a clothsline. Once the edges curled, it was no longer comfortable to sleep on and moved all over the bed when he moved in his sleep so it no longer did much good. Wouldn't purchase again even though the price was not too bad."
2,Not worth it!,"For one, it was very stiff, even after being washed. It wasn't wide enough for a single width hospital bed. Wasted money."
4,"great game, great movie","When I first got this game, I really liked it. I LOVE dinosaurs, but there was only one thing I didn't like in this game: no Bruton! He is my favorite dinosaur! Don't ask me why. My favorite level in this game was level 7; Finding Neera. I don't know why, it's probably because t's nighttime (don't worry, you can still see the numerous raptors, about 3 or 4 Albertosaurus and the Spinosaurus that's attacking Neera). My least favorites are level 5 and 6, The Lake and Baby Sitting. If you're a little stupid (like I was) you'd be stumped on level 9 Unwelcome Guest. Here's how you do it: have at least 3 lightning energy (which helps your charachter do a special attack), go to one of the loose ceilings(make sure the Carnotaurus follows) and do Aladar's thunder stomp. the ceiling will fall down on the Carnotaur's head. You have to do that on all 3 loose ceilings until the Carnotaurus is buried under rocks. Anyway, I'd recomend this to a dino lover."
1,Awful!,This was by far the worst brown rice I have ever eaten. It was mushy and tasteless. I bought a dozen of them on automatic shipments. I am tossing 11 of them away and cancelling the auto delivery.
5,Organic brown rice is a must have!,"Organic brown rice is healthy, has no bleach or chemicals like white rice and it is gluten free for all to enjoy. Heats about a minute and a half in the microwave and this size container can serve 2 or you can spoon out half to microwave on a plate for one night and save the other half for the next night. Buy and enjoy along with your meal!"
5,"Soft, a mini crib mattress yet ample sizing for thicker 50 coil mini crib mattress!","I was very pleased when I opened the package of this delightfully printed, mini crib sheet. The softness of the material and deep pockets, regarding the sizing, was a happy discovery. I did not expect this fine quality in a mini crib sheet,so reasonably priced. I am very pleased with this product!"
4,cute and so soft,Got this for our new mini crib. Fits the mattress just fine and is so very very soft. We will be getting more in other colors :)
5,add me to the kudo list..........,"This is another constant around the house............ useful for just about everything doing with squeaks, tough to move/operate and bind-ups. It's much better, quicker, less messy and easier to use than any kind/form of oil on hesitant, noisy hinges My dad was king of the WD-40 use - sprayed it everywhere, helpful or not!"
4,Fast cleaner,"The setting on my wedding ring gets dirty very quickly, and has a lot of little crevices. This product did a great job cleaning my ring quickly and beautifully! I also tried to use it on a pair of earrings which I thought were silver, but it turned them a yellowish brown color. It did the same thing to a metal (not silver) ring I had, too. That is the only reason this got a 4 star rating instead of 5 star."
2,Was Not Impressed,I didn't think this worked any better than an ammonia solution and a tooth brush. I would not buy it again.
3,Looks GREAT immediately following a cleaning but...,"But the cleaning only lasts about a week. It seems like there's some residue left behind that ""attracts"" dust/dirt. I definitely need to give my platinum/diamond ring a good polishing once a week with this."
1,Do not use on silver!!!,"I have almost exclusively silver jewelry and I bought this to clean up older pieces that I haven't worn in ages. Unfortunately I only paid attention to the good reviews, some of which said this was fine for silver. This product is most certainly NOT FINE for silver. I left a Tiffany bracelet - nothing fancy, just a chain - in there for 3 days, and it came out almost black. I was shocked. I haven't worn it in a while so it's not a key piece but I am very disappointed and frankly surprised that a cleaner that would work so well on gold and diamonds would ruin silver jewelry. I will be requesting a refund."
4,Another good Mr. Putter and Tabby ...,"This is a wonderful series for beginning readers. The characters (Mr. Putter and his fine cat, Tabby) are captivating and endearing to readers of all ages. Their antics are always interesting, if not downright hilarious. Unfortunately, this story is not as good as some of the others. My kindergardener read it to me over the last few days. Although he enjoyed reading it, because he loves the characters, he did not laugh or get excited like he did when reading some of the other books in the series. Nevertheless, I do recommend this book. It has a nice message of friendship: Mr. Putter's neighbor, and friend, gives his writing a ""good review,"" even though it isn't the book/story that he set out to write. It has a nice message about life too: Mr. Putter enjoyed the experience so much that he can't wait for the next snowstorm so he can write again. I'd recommend any book in this series for beginning (k-1st) readers."
4,Jersey,I ordered this jersey for my 12 year old brother in law for his birthday and he loved it so i was very happy!
5,Excellent collectible game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Love Monopoly and have been a collector of different versions for years. If you're a real Monopoly lover,golf fan and a true aficionado, then you will have the taste to appreciate this game!"
4,Calico Bush is a great book,"The author, Rachel Field, excells at making her book come to life. The people in the story show quality traits of courage and kindness. The first part is a little boring, but the rest is superb. I love history and this is one of my favorite books that takes place during the French and Indian War."
2,Didn't Care For It Very Much,"Less than halfway through the book, I found (to my disappointment) that there was not much new here. I slogged through the rest of it, but didn't care for it very much."
2,PRODUCT FEATURES,"To: Amazon-HELP NEEDED!This item's description on AMAZON'S webpage is incorrect. Buyers will be confused and uninformed about the purpose and quialty of this product. Please take note that this item is a soap dish. Its finish and size are not known, but are needed for buyers to make an informed decision. I am interested in purchasing this product, but don't have enough information about its description. I prefer solid antique brass finish.Thank you!"
1,Not worth reading,"Just started reading Charlaine and have enjoyed one or two. Read the first Aurora and enjoyed.Unfortunately, A BONE TO PICK is not worth the time. The plot is somewhat suspect (no pun intended) and after some 200 pages (and end of the book almost upon us) we still have no substance.In fact, Roe has spend most of her time debating moving into the inherited home and wondering as to whom is responsible for the skull.Incredibly boring. I will move on to Aurora book 3 and hope things get back to normal"
3,Aurora becomes a lady of leisure,I think I may have nailed down why I like this series. It's about the Aurora's personal life first and the mystery second. Aurora doesn't go out looking for murder or mayhem but it finds it's way into her life and she has a curiosity that won't let her just let it go.
2,Silly,"This Southern librarian turned amateur, bumbling sleuth novel is now a teenager, and as such has not aged gracefully.I don't mind far-fetched plots, some of the time, but I object to far-fetched, silly plots peopled with silly, unlikeable people.No, I do not like Aurora Teagarden, although I did in Real Murders. However, I find her mother obnoxious to the point where I cringe when she comes on the scene. Even more, the whole community in their little town is enough to send me looking for another book.I am definitely not crazy about flat characters who judge others by the value of their houses, the perfection of their make-up or the cut of their bridesmaid dresses. And who are more concerned about personal inconvenience than going to the police...Or authors who seem to think that first babies are born within ten minutes of one's waters breaking."
4,Another Harris winner.,"Harris has done it again! This is my second Aurora Teagarden story and I can't wait to read more. Much time has past since I last left Roe in Real Murders, but Harris fills in the time nicely. And for the second time, the murderer surprised me...that's my kind of mystery. Well done!"
5,An Easy Way to Identify Spending Habits,"I've enjoyed this book so much. It has helped me to determine which rascals are at work in my spending habits and which ones need a little more attention.It's an easy to understand explanation of how to help yourself change old patterns.Kudos to Susan Zimmerman, the Fiscal Therapist!!"
4,The Weirdest Dance Record I've Ever Heard,"This album is fun. Sure, Reed was over the top at this point. But isn't that where fans expect their heroes to be? The lyrics are strange; one song depicts a cat and dog shooting up human sweat! Meow; I can dig it, Lou! Buy 'Sally,' then head straight to the follow-ups: 'Lou Reed Live' and 'Metal Machine Music.' If one can make it through these drug-obsessed, self-indulgent (but interesting) outings, a huge reward comes via his 1976 masterpiece, 'Coney Island Baby.' Lou, I swear I'd give the whole thing up for you!"
3,Missing Subtitles on Episode 6,All other episodes have subtitles. I tried multiple copies and the subtitle problem persists. Rather disappointing given the otherwise excellent anime.
2,Print too small,"I love the look of the bible, but the print is too small even for my 22 year old for whom I purchased the bible"
3,Not a bad product,"I've had one of these little gadgets. It worked really well. My favorite attachment was the little sponge. It was just the right size to allow me to focus on specific areas of my face that needed extra exfoliation at times. It also had just the right texture to scrub and smoothe my skin. For a battery-operated unit, I found the tool was powerful enough to be effective. The only issue I had/have with this product is that after about a year of use, the little sponge sponge finally detached from the base and the manufacturer offers no opportunity to purchase more attachments, forcing satisfied customers to purchase a whole new kit. Otherwise, I really like this product better than some other kits I've tried. It worked well. It's compact and convenient for travelling, and I was able to use it with my favorite facial products.-CG of NYC"
4,"Pedro visita los estudios Tepeyac. ( ""Gable visits Paramount","A nostalgic film in many ways, with great cameo appearances. The most notable is a brief argument he has with Tin Tan (playing himself), that should've last longer, but the one when he sings second in a duet with Pedro Vargas is undoubtedly the best version of ""La negra noche"". Oscar Pulido and the unforgettable Vitola are the indispensable ration of comedy and they are in top form. But to top it all, he ended up married in real life to his sister in this movie (Irma). It's great to see this kind of movies restored and digitally reproduced in DVD. Thank you. We need more of this to preserve all those wonderful Mexican movies of the 40's and early 50's"
1,Not Helpful,"This book is a nightmare! We have been doing this book for 3 months in a Tech Class Monday - Friday 5 hours a day!The book for me, is so crazy. The author jumps from one thing to the next and puts labs thoughout the chapter that are long, and you think you are reading the chapter, but you end up reading into the lab. The labs should have been at the end of the chapters.The questions at the end many times don't make sense, and you can't find the right answers in the chapter.I have been so dissappointed with so many books from Course Technology, as they all seem to lack real information and ways to impliment it.So far everyone in my class who went for the XP exam has failed, and said the book was useless, and didn't cover the things the exam asked for.One class mate did pass, but that was because she was using several other books and some video DVD's.Once again, I have asked my Tech School to take this book and have it replaced!Useless for the exam!"
3,Grill Pan,"The product is fine, exactly what I had ordered. Unfortunately, it seems that everything that comes from Amazon is improperly packed. There always seems to be some kind of damage. In this case the grill pan was slightly bowed. So eventhough it looked to be in perfect condition the pan doesn't sit completely flat on the grill."
1,2 in a Row and Still Nothing.,"I ordered this after readin lots of reviews. But after receiving it I was disappointed after only weighting myself one time, it quite working. It would come on but would not stay on or take my weight, so I figured i would give it another try and sent it back and get another. But after i receive the second one i had the same problem. So unitl they get this fixed this is the worst scale availble..."
4,Should have been called the R1100RS book,"It covers the history of the brand, of the boxer motor and the developement cycle of the R259 series. It has LOTS of nice photographs of the prototype motorcycles for the RS, pictures of the new motor under various angles (assembled & dissassembled) and of various parts of the RS. It has a somewhat limited coverage of the GS, S, RT, 1200C, F and K series (about 6-8 pages each). Very good for boxer enthusiasts, but I was a bit dissapointed since I am an RT fan I would have liked to see more of it in the book."
5,Excellent,"Very happy with these lights. We had 2 other sets of the parrot and palm trees and added this to our collection for a Margaritaville theme. These fit right in. The cord is nice, not too thin like a lot of other sets. Would order from this store again. They shipped quickly and verified the item arrived to our satisfaction."
2,broken impact wrench,The unit was broken when I received it. Amazon was very good about returning the product and my reimbursement.
2,Runs a Bit Small,"Oh, how I love PrimaDonna bras! I own about 7 right now. Everything from the Deauville, Madison full cup (and that Madison that is basically a demi bra), and the Sambal. I really wanted to get the satin underwire as my t-shirt bra. Unfortunately, the bra runs small, at least for me.All other PrimaDonna bras I have in a G cup. For the satin underwire, the G cup is just too small. The band size also seems on the tight side, but not nearly as bad as the cup size. If it were up to me I would get this bra at least one cup size up; but, PrimaDonna doesn't make an H cup in my band size for this bra, so this will be just one PrimDonna I won't get to add to my collection. :("
3,Not recommended,"I bought this book when it was first available, because I urgently needed a book to learn EJB. It turned out that this book taught me much less than I learned from the EJB Spec itself, which is more clear, logical and rigorous. As a first book in this new technology, it is acceptable, but today I think there're definitely better choices."
1,Too simplistic and full of typos,"This book takes a very high level simplistic approach. In doing so, it sometimes provides the wrong information.An 'old-line monitor'??The author also seems to be confused with OLTP. There are plenty of 'white papers' and online tutorials on the web that provides better and correct information.The publisher should have provided better 'technical reviews' and 'typos checking'for this book. I would suggest the other EJB books that are currently on the market."
2,Simply an overview - nothing to get excited about,Nothing spectacular about this book - but yup its a gentle intro to the newcomer. Better off reading the specs & other articles available on the net
3,Delivered as Promised,"This book does exactly what it promises. It helps the average Java developer to understand the EJB world. This is the first real book on EJB. I'm sure that the author was trying to get the book to market so people like me could learn from his midnight-oil sessions. I hope that the author does a second book to discuss more advanced topics.My only ""problem"" with the book was an error (in my humble opinion), where the author confuses the issue of bulk-loading vs. OLTP, and states that, ""...indices can actually slow performance and should generally be avoided"" pg.188 - I don't expect the author to know everything, so this one I blame on the technical reviewers & editors."
1,Avoid the new formula,"The old formula was great. Darkened my beard in minutes, with no smell and no skin irritation.But the manufacturer changed the formula, probably to save a few pennies. The new formula feels like acid on your skin. It can give your skin a nasty chemical burn.If you contact the manufacturer, they try to dodge responsibility by blaming YOU! ""Well, you must have extra-sensitive skin.""What management IDIOT was responsible for this change?The new formulation probably saves them a few pennies, which is a drop in the bucket compared to the huge loss of revenue as longtime users like me abandon this product!The old formula was great. They should have stuck to it. If it ain't broke, DON'T FIX IT!"
5,It is very good for my Golden Retreivers coat.,Great for my Golden Retreivers coat and shine and soft. Also Omega 3 and no scratching in dry winter weather
4,An important read,"Despite feeling defensive over some questions of motive and accuracy about Jack's public school years, this book is a must read for those of us who want to know more about our dear Lewis. Sayers treats his life very thoroughly and satisfyingly, and Jack's years of maturity are full of wonderful quotes and personal stories, as he was then a good friend of Lewis. I hope you read it and endure to the end! I could hardly put it down- Lewis' life is a singing testimony to the glory of God and the mythic wonder of man walking on the earth."
3,Good book BUT contain STOLEN documents from SMPTE,Good and complete book about digital TV Only problem many of the pictures which are copyrihted are STOLEN from SMPTE
2,Not a fundamental book,"Though title indicates this book is about fundamentals of Digital TV, it is for people who have prior knowledge of TV. This book is not beginners."
3,Pretty cakes but not descriptive enough,"I'm a beginner cake decorator and this book said great for beginners. Not really true. The cakes were beautiful and there were some helpful hints in this book but, there were no color pictures except for the cakes. The cake recipe, which I made, really did not give you enough info, like what size cake pans it would fit in. I found other books to be much more helpful. I was disappointed to say the least."
3,From the back cover,"Could East and West love side by side? They were in love - why shouldn't they be married? But both Felicia and Faisal knew there would be problems. Ordinary English girls just didn't marry wealthy Arabs.On a cloud of love and optimism, Felicia flew to Kuwait to meet Faisal's family, to gain their trust, love and approval...But Faisal's dictatorial uncle, Raschid, had no intention of allowing Felicia to marry his nephew, and his methods of driving her away were dishonorable and grossly unfair. Though Felicia resented his prejudiced attitude, she had to admit the man himself fascinated her."
3,SOOO OVERHYPED,"For all the raving Ive heard about this band, I expected sooo much more from them. I tend to agree with the reviewer... Theyre not bad, theyre okay, but its just that. Okay. Theres nothing new, fresh or different here. Theres also nothing particularly interesting about the lead singer's voice.I venture as far as to say Cooly's is a poor man's Brand New Heavies/Incognito. Imagine being used to barbeque spare ribs, and then being offered some barbeque flavored potato chips. Thats my analogy. Theres imitation barbeque seasoning on your fingers, but wheres the sauce? Use your discretion... and go get you some REAL ribs :)"
1,No sizes listed!,Can it be possible that these idiots forgot to include the SIZES of the bandages they're selling? Or have I missed it? Surgilast has at least 16 different sizes (with corresponding Catalog numbers) available. All I see here is a price. Is the product for a finger? For a chest? There are many listings for this company and they are useless to us! How can anyone know what to buy?
2,Way overpriced!!,"Hmm, ok. Was irrated with my first attempt at using this thing. If I'm going to drop $200, I'd expect this type of a program to be error free- but it turns out there were MISTAKES in answers. I triple checked and even had another person confirm the error. Super freakin' irritating. I;m better off shelling cash over to sites like lumosity since they are web based and can be accessed where ever one can use the internet.. not to mention cheaper."
2,Alternate mixes my a**e!,"Having just done a side by side comparison with Massacred Millions vs One Struggle One Fight, I've got to say that to me, they sound exactly the same, except One Struggle One Fight has been nicely remastered while Massacred Millions sound terrible in comparison.Save your money, & just buy One Struggle One Fight.If like me, you bought Massacred Millions expecting alternate mixes, at least you console yourself with getting 4 tracks which don't seem to appear elsewhere, Intro, Enter A New Phase (only live versions previously available), State Enemy & Never Let Go."
1,SPEND YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY ELSEWHERE,"This video was really bad. Too much fading in and out of scenes. Mostly stadium riding with lots of sparkley fireworks. One of the biggest dissapointments was the N.Zealand and Western Oz section. It was the same stadium junk and none of the awesome natural terrain there.This video seems to be a bunch of old tape slapped together. None of the old Seth footage is on it. Its mostly ""metal dullisha"" junk. Deegan acting like a moron as usual. If this represents freestyle motocross, its time for a new crew of strictly natural terrain riders. This stadium and ramp game is lame.Just buy the 1st Crusty Demons of Dirt.After that they all went Hollywood."
3,got the wrong product,"Since this didn't suit my needs I subsequently got another Taiyo Yuden product. I got the watershield version and it was just like the CD-R version and gave me the exact same results. By the way, I had to start using the CD and DVD logos with my burner/printer so people could tell the difference. As of now I have about 150 DVD-Rs that I probably won't ever use. Shopping can be a trial and error experience. Don't get discouraged or give up."
2,Not like the old ones,"I loved the LeapFrog Maracas my niece had, so I bought these thinking they would be as good. They are really heavy for my little one to hold, and they don't hold her attention for more than a minute or two. They count, make silly noises, and say the colors. My little girl loves music, but these don't actually play any. The old version has a clear top, so the kids could see the beads shaking around. These are not see through. Just a disappointment."
2,A bit disappointing,One of the maracas lights up and makes sounds instead of the traditional rattle sound. The other is the traditional rattle one. The battery operated one only works sometimes and it's disappointing that the two aren't the same.
5,Fun,They are so fun my grand baby loves them. He has dropped them several times and they still work great.
3,Not as exciting as I'd hoped,"My 10-month old loves her Alphabet Drum so I figured these would be fun for her as well. She likes the one that just shakes, but the one with the activities doesn't do a thing for her. She has very little interest in them..."
4,Shake It Slowly,"I bought these for my neice for her 1 year old birthday. I read reviews that said the one maraca that lit up and made noise got more children's attention than the one that was a normal maraca, however, my neice preferred the plain one the first time I gave them to her! She liked how she could shake them to her own beat. She didn't quite get how to shake the one that counts, sings, and tells her the colors, but she liked how it lit up....This toy requires a little patience because if it is in the middle of saying a color for example and you shake it again, it won't register and immediately switch the the next color. I think with a little time and help from mom she will put 2 and 2 together that the words match the actions of the toy."
5,Counting maracas - fun for several ages,"Both nephews, and both my kids, all different ages, were wild about these."
2,A let down,"After opening it we realized its one regular maraca and one that lights up and sings. So my son only plays with the one colorful maraca. I bough these because he loves real maracas in music class, but theses just don't do it in out house."
1,Does not work.,It doesn't count numbers when you shake it or do what it was supposed to do. Only sings an introductory song and that was all.I am going to return it
1,Very disapppointed!,"This toy is too heavy for smaller babies. Not only has my son smacked himself, he's given ME a fat lip with them. You have to shake them just right for the battery operated maraca to register, which isn't real helpful in learning cause and effect or to count.They also are not durable. Four months after buying the battery operated maraca will only play in Spanish, no matter how many times we try and change the switch. Very displeased. This is the second leap frog toy we've had break (technically the third, we've had two of the musical tables break). I will not buy another leap frog toy, they have a quality control issue."
4,Fun toy for my 1 year old,"I really like this toy but with all toys, my son seems to play with it and be over it pretty quickly. He still likes it though and he's had it for 6 months. One of the maracas has sound with a counting option, color option etc. The other one is just like a rattle. I don't think I realized that before I bought it. Anyway, the top changes color anytime you bang or shake it. That is one thing though...even I have a hard time shaking it enough for it to change. My son just bangs it on the floor or on his hand to make it change colors etc. Overall though, it's a good and extremely durable toy. I can't tell you how many times this toy has been drooped on our hard floors."
2,learn adn groove maracas,"My teens love this toy, but the baby could care less about it. Only one of the maracas work; the other is just a rattle. Don't waste your money!"
4,They work great!,"The goggles work! They may not be for professionals, however using them for enjoyment has been great. They don't leak and they are crystal clear.Thanks!"
5,Best Goggles,I have a hard time getting goggles to fit my eye socket so that water doesn't leak in - these solve that problem and they're very comfortable.
5,Finally -- goggles that I love!!!,I love these goggles -- great visibility and clarity. Best of all they don't leak!!
5,Awesome,"My husband never liked the tight feeling of wearing swimming goggles. In a recent search for comfortable goggles he found these Aqua Sphere Seal Swim Mask and bought them to try. He had them on and swam some laps. No leak, very comfy. He just love it."
1,Not for EVERY head,"Like another reviewer said, this mask doesn't fit well if you've got a somewhat big/wide head. Shame on me for not fully testing this before a recent triathlon! I had to complete the darn swim portion using strokes other than freestyle--since anytime I twisted my head during freestyle, water leaked into the side of this mask. Clearly, it's one size fits *some*. If you happen to wear a large-ish hat size, think again about buying this particular mask."
3,"Don't trust John Matlock ""Gunny's"" review",I bought Thomas Teufels book and found it semi useful. I went back to see if there were any other SAP Business One books published. Checking the reviews I noticed someone who had given the book five stars. I found this strange and checked which other books he had reviewed. Turns out he has reviewed almost 2000 books and from what I could see he has only handed out five stars with a few exceptions which have been fours.He is making a mockery of the whole rating system and should not be allowed to mislead Amazon customers any longer.
3,Good Sequel,"This was a good sequel to ""Hot Blooded"" but not nearly as compelling.It started slow. Once it picked up, it was much more interesting. However, it felt like there was too much going on at once and when everything came to a head at the end, you were left feeling like not everything was quite resolved.I look forward to more books from this author."
2,Great Wanderlust... Just Leave Home Without the Author,"I thought that the author did a good job of putting us all in the cockpit as they sail the world. However, while this book may recieve 5 stars from husband/wife teams who love to hear endless stories about the ups and downs that sailing can have on a relationship and on a persons mental health, for me it was more of a soap opera than a sailing book. While the mental aspects of both crew and captain should be heavily discussed in such a book, this one lacked any shread of detail about (1. the different cultures visited, 2. SAILING THE WORLD IN A CATAMARAN) My main objective was to hear about the plausibility of sailing the world in a Cat.. To be honest, I would have tossed the author overboard within the first 2 months of the trip."
2,"""Unbreakable"" File Arrives Broken!","Perhaps the clear plastic part of this hanging wall file is ""unbreakable"" (doubt it) but the darker colored back piece arrived broken in my shipment. There's a little plastic piece on each side of the black backing that catches and secures the clear part of the file, and these little pieces are not reinforced.I happened to have super glue handy and was able to do a quick fix, but receiving the ""unbreakable"" product obviously broken is VERY disappointing. And really, how many people have time to deal with sending things back nowadays?And to be clear, this is not necessarily a packaging issue - the product itself has weak plastic parts that likely will not last long."
5,A long time ago!,"I read the book as soon as it was published. I presume I was one of many hungering for the book as I knew vince bramley personally, although he himself will mostprobably not remeber me.He was a L/CPL in the trg BN that I did my basic training in, in 1990. I had a face and a voice to go with the book! As a young soldier the book gripped and excited me, it made me fearful and thoughtful.In hindsight the book was good for me in one way: as a soldier it opened my eyes to the extent that war was not glamourous and very dangerous indeed, through personal experience later in my service I thought back to when I bought the book and my thoughts were: ""HOW TRUE"".Excellent book!!"
5,"A real excursion to war, the worst hell on Earth","I'd like to recommend this book because it means a lot to me. As a argentinian that I am it touched my feelings and the way the author describes his story is impressing. You can actually feel that you are at war and afraid to die. As himself describes usually soldiers' stories are not told, and they dies with the people who fought. This book is exactly what it takes to show how stupid are human beings solving troubles by killing each others."
5,THE BEST ON THE PLANET,I PURCHASE THE NUMARK WM200 MICROPHONE IT WAS THE BEST PRICE AND FASTEST SHIPMENT ON THIS UNIVERSE.
3,Shame about this single,"After great songs on Step One (now out in the US) I was slightly disappointed by this song from their second album. It has little of the dance-floor feel of ""One For Sorrow""""Better Best Forgotten""""Tragedy"" or ""Last thing on my mind"".I would definitely advise US fans to buy Step One, and maybe Steptacular. Generally they try to be nothing more than cheesy but the music is still upbeat and fun. It has got to be the dance music around if you like dancing properly. p.s. One for Sorrow is such a copy of ABBAs ""The Winner Takes it All"" that it is unreal."
2,Almost Unreadable,"Murphy's Law of College Textbooks: When an author prepares a textbook on a topic he doesn't understand thoroughly, his work will only be understood by those readers who understand more about the topic than the writer . . . thus defeating the prime purpose of writing, which is to inform those who understand less about the topic than the writer.The above statement applies to this textbook more than to any other that I have ever read in my life. Each chapter reduces to nothing more than an inscrutable collection of formulas. The authors do not provide even the slightest beginning of an insight to a student attempting to learn the material from this text."
5,"Unique, surprising puppet","Very cute and unusual. My toddler was intrigued right away, and still requests the scallop frequently. I also like that the Folkmanis puppets come with a tag giving basic facts about the animal."
5,Laziness is a mantra for me...,"I'm 19 years old, I have to say that Laziness has become a true way of life for me. I got my copy of ""Master the Grill the Lazy Way"" yesterday afternoon, and it's already become my cooking bible. The book itself is absolutely histerical, and the recipes are remarkable -- both tastey and easy. The writers are truely fantastic people, and I aspire to be as Lazy as they are some day."
1,My fate is not being able to play the game.,"I enjoyed playing this game up to the point it becomes impossible. How is this? It started in Dragast, the second stage of the game. The first puzzle I encountered was visually blocked out by green and white vertical lines that cover the entire screen. I thought maybe this was an isolated problem. I was able to get by this one puzzle referring to a walkthrough (kind of ruins it for me). The very next puzzle had a similar problem. I contacted Dreamcatcher and was given a patch to download and install that was supposed to fix the problem. No such luck. I have since been requested to provide some information from my pc and I am waiting for a response. This problem occured with two separate sets of disks. Only some of the puzzles are affected. I think the graphics are great and would love to be able to play this game minus the problems."
1,Stale bits of cardboard,"I really thought I would like these crackers, but I hated them. I started giving away the tubs of crackers to my friends, hoping that someone would find them edible, but no luck. I think all SIX tubs went in the trash. Big waste of money."
4,Fly Tying and Fishing for Panfish and Bass,L like this book because it tells you something about the fish and how to fish for them. At the back of the book it gives plenty of fly recipes.
3,"Functional enough, but pointless if you're serious about violin","This rosin works okayish enough, but as others have said, it's pretty much what you expect to get for free when you buy your violin, which is to say you get what you pay for. For only about $10 more you can get the stuff professionals use, so why not? Cheap rosin doesn't make economical sense. I kinda bought this in a rush because I was so excited about getting a violin but I should have researched more."
5,Super Sensitive Light Violin Rosin,"Super Sensitive Light Violin Rosin, good price and easy to use. My daughter loves to apply and play Rosin to her violin herself."
4,Good for learning,"This rosin may not be top quality stuff, but if you are a student or just casually learning to play violin, this is perfect for you. The lower quality of this compared to premium (and expensive) rosins will not be noticed unless you play at a proficient level and have a pretty high quality instrument. I recommend this rosin."
2,Not so great,You would be better off spending a bit more money and getting rosin that covers better. Doesn't really work too well.
5,A blast!,This ensemble is extremely creative...and always has been. Fun to listen to! Very enjoyable. Will definitely check out their other offerings.
2,Not a great buy,I bought one of these and within the month it broke. I contacted the seller and they quickly sent me a replacement. That one lasted about 2 months. I wouldn't buy it again that's for sure.
4,T.Rex,"It is with much joy that I learned via the purchase of this great dvd how good a band T-Rex really was.I am 53 years old and listen to most music from My Bloody Valentine to Peter Frampton. I was never a fan of T-Rex in the day as I was listening to Hendrix, Led Zepelin and the Stones then.Fortunately this disc was released and I happened to see a bit of it at a friends house recently.I was so impressed that I ordered it from Amazon as soon as I was able to.The second disc explains how painstaking it was to get this venture together and in so doing a group who were the biggest rock outfit for 2 years, can now really be appreciated live.The disc makes it clear why T-Rex were so popular. Glyn Johns has done such an oustanding job with the sound that the picture dissapoints,understandably, seeing as it was filmed all those years ago. A great dvd to be enjoyed by all."
4,Lighten up!,"Three for this price?! At a popular chain store they are six dollars a piece.I bought these to go with the Litesnow pendant lights. When ever I need to bump up to free shipping. I just might order more.LitesNow Valo Instant Track Do-it-Yourself 3 Fixture with Shades Hardwire Pendant Light Kit, Silver"
5,Beautiful Sound,"I am delighted with this wind chime. The tones are astoundingly beautiful. This chime has added significantly to our backyard area where we have worked long and hard to provide a peaceful, restful sanctuary."
2,Not as good as i thought it would be,I was surprised I didn't like this book as I usually like this author but frankly I couldn't even remember what it was about a few weeks after I read it. Oh Well different strokes for different folks....
1,Boring!,"and bad fantasy, too! This book was a thorough disappointment--stiff, unbelievable characters, tedious, lame world building...not worth your time or money."
2,Ok here are the facts....,You love sci fiction you will love this book. If you are into seemingly pointless plots more power to you. Great art but the plot has little interest and half the time you are confused out of your mind about what is going on. I thought it was going to be a good read but read the first couple of chapters before you add this book to you collection. Save yourself 10 bucks
5,Not Just For Young Adults,"I know the category states ""young adult."" Maybe so, but I'm no longer anywhere near ""young adult"" and I still find the durable (and classy) metal cover (either ""thirsty"" [ISBN: 0-8423-7232-6] or contemporary cross [ISBN: 0-8423-7233-4]) and ""New Living Translation"" to be an irresistable combination and a great addition to my ""commuter kit.""Want a compact Bible that will be able to withstand the rigors of always having it with you? Want a readable modern translation that is faithful to the original texts? Buy this - you won't be disappointed."
1,Tiger's view of men is unfounded,"Tiger's view of the decline of males fails to take the power of the patriarchy in contemporary society. When he speaks of the lack of a ""male"" activist group such as the National Organization for Women, he fails to see the domination men have in some many sectors of society. Is a United States Congress that is over 90 percent male not patriarchal? When over 99 percent of Fortune 500 CEO's are male, is corporate America nota patriarchy. And the family problems that have been created in the last half of the 20th century have far more factors that a partial expansion of Women's Rights. Maybe some men have problems with being able to control their body through birth control and abortion. But the changes that Tiger would espouse would again give males a ""biological"" influence over a women's body. The decline of males is not as severe as Tiger states. And the changes he espouses would merely reinforce the patriarchy."
1,Major problems with a pattern in this book,I have been trying to knit the Diamond Lace Baby Set and am facing major problems! Even the errata sheet that came with the book has errors in this pattern. The chart for the sweater front contains several errors.
5,the only childrens book you ll ever need,"This book is the only one you ll ever need to knit for baby and child ! the explanation is clear, the photos are very beautiful and the selection enormous. Even if you cannot knit, it is a great book to just look through."
5,"If you've seen the film, read the book.","I first learned of Geoffrey Wellum by seeing his story on DVD and it was a great film and as an aviation buff, I just wanted to see if the book would back up the film. It did and more as many facts are in the book that weren't in the film. It's honestly written and a compelling read."
2,repetitive,"This book certainly does not rate more than two stars. It is repetitive ------ with beers, toast, tea, clouds and dozens of names. The trouble is some sixty years after the experiences Wellum tries to write as a twenty year old rather than tell the whole story other than `Boys own' Except sometimes when he moralizes with hindsight which is dreadful. There is no mention in the book whatever of any German attacks on the airfields he flew from which were well bashed by Goring and his boys prior to the Battle of Britian.The feel of what went on does not come through with the passion it deserves."
5,Gripping Read,Excellent book. Tough to put the book down as the author's narrative takes the reader into the cockpit of a Battle of Britain Spitfire. Should be a Hollywood movie someday.
3,Challenging,"I found this very helpful in helping me to understand women and the way we approach fertility. At times I found it focussed a little too much on your familial relationships as being the basis for fertility difficulties and I think there are a lot more aspects to it, but having said that, the emotional aspect is important and not to be sidelined by a focus on the physical"
3,the plot; and the contents:,"My problem with the book is that it takes her more than half of a really long book just to introduce all the characters (each individually) before beginning to bring them together; and them being together is the point of the book. Her writing is good, the aliens and cultures interesting.... but the start is very very very slow....My other problem is with the reviews. One reviewer, (male) says that the sex scenes, while explicit, ""do not quite reach the level of rape"". Since there are at least three very explicit and violent rapes, including one with incest/molestation, and one with rape and murder, while the third is repeated rape and physical abuse within an arranged marriage, I fail to see where it ""does not quite reach the level of"".....I applaud Crispin for addressing these issues and making strong anti-abuse and anti-slavery statements, embedded in the story. Obviously some readers still didn't get it."
1,Sometimes you wonder why you keep reading...,"It's because you've read most of this author's previous works, in various formats, from the mysteries, to historical and even the lesbian leaning. And liked them.But this was a huge disappointment. Although most probably, I would agree with Ms. Brown's political leanings and share in her fears of biological warfare, if I wanted a lecture, I'd attend one. If I needed to reinforce my paranoia, I'd read non-fiction. But I read to be entertained, and this was not entertaining. I read to escape those very things she hit me over the head with. Yes, books should make you think, but if she wants to enter that arena, she needs to re-market herself.I wanted a mystery. The only one I got was trying to figure out why in the world I kept reading this book to the finish."
1,13th book in the series,"13 proves to be unlucky for Ms. Brown as the 13th book in this series is pretty unreadable. I look forward to new installments and was very disappointed in this book. The plot is thin and the book is overloaded with heavy handed lectures and dialogue that is contrived, artificial and pedantic. Too much research on 'slew' of subjects and not enough attention paid to the whole point of writing the book in the first place.....to tell a good story! Sadly, there was not much story, not much mystery and not much reason to buy this book."
1,Very Dissapointed,"I have always loved this series, but the last two have started to take a downward turn. This one is so dissapointing I don't even think I will keep it (I have all the others and enjoy re-reading them). The bio-terrorism stuff was really not needed, the characters were never engaging, and the book really lacked the come on in and sit down feel the others have. You never get involved in the story, and most of what happens really isn't developed enough. If Archie is a past relationship of Harry, why did we never hear of him before? Why was Todd so crazy? Character developement is sorely lacking, and it is what I have really enjoyed in the past installments. And although I love the animals, and admit their banter keeps me laughing, I don't think they should always be coming to the rescue of Harry every single time. It is getting a little tired. I hope the next book goes back to the standards of the previous books, I will keep my fingers crossed."
4,Love Mrs. Murphy!,"I really enjoy all the Mrs. Murphy mystery stories. This book, Sour Puss, has my favorite scene of all, Harry and Fair's wedding, during which Mrs. Murphy and Pewter have a ""cat fight"". I howled with laughter the first time I read this scene and have re-read it several times, as I enjoyed it so much. Thank you, Rita Mae for your always entertaining views from the animal world. I always new they talked, now it is confirmed. :)"
1,Very Disappointing,"I'm a great fan of the Mrs. Murphy series - I've read every book in this series. Sour Puss is a HUGE disappointment. What made the previous books in the series so delightful was the wonderful animals, of course, but also, the portrait of small-town life in Crozet, populated with fascinating characters. Sour Puss is a complete departure from the rest of the series. While we still get some charming scenes with the animal protagonists, the humans are one-dimensional. The book is one long lecture after another on Ms. Brown's political views, vineyards, bioterrorism, and Ms. Brown's increasingly elitist economic views. The book seems obsessed with wealth. Now that ""Harry"" has remarried and left the Post Office, perhaps this series needs to be retired. Personally, I'm not interested in reading about a bunch of smug rich yuppies, even if they are in rural Virginia!"
3,What Happened?,"I've always been a fan of Rita Mae Brown's works. Her Sneaky Pie series has always been the rose of her works, with wonderful character development (human and animal). I don't even mind her political leanings, to me they add to the charm and realism of the novels. However, I was disappointed in Sour Puss. It seems that a lot of the characters are settling down so a lot of the tension is gone in the novels. While I enjoy the realism this provides, the tension in characters that you can relate to really made her earlier works come alive. I'd like to see some fresh, permanant charcacters come into the series and stir things up a bit."
4,The unlikely vampire story,This is my first book I read by Anne Rice. I decided to hear it on tape during my interstate trip by car. I was suprised to see that vampire character had a tortured past and that the enourmous suffering he encountered propelled him to cross roads with the middle aged woman from New Orleans horribly shaken by the losses in her life. The two are joined by their love for the violin and the wonderful music the instrument produces. It is an unlikely story of redemption for both characters and that is what I liked about this book.
1,Utter drivel,"Sorry Anne, I tried...from the deepest bowels of my wretched soul, I so did try. It was my heart's utmost desire to be enthralled and engrossed by this novel. Alas, it read about as painfully as the opening lines of this woe-some review thine eyes have just read, oh dear reader.The dialogue was contrived, unnatural, overly dramatic. And frankly, rather than devoting hundreds of precious words to describe, hair color and texture, chest hair, skin colour, waif-like physique and the like, how about using that towards ACTUAL plot??? Once you've described a tall, thin, dark stranger within the first few pages, do I really need to be reminded in every subsequent chapter?I used to love Anne Rice's works hence the reason I keep coming back for more punishment. This however may be the last novel I buy of hers. Pity, because she really is a brilliant writer."
3,Too much in one,"I don't like this toy, because it tries to pack too much into one toy. Yes, exposing children to numbers and letters early on is good, and this toy will definitely get their attention, but I think the LED letters and numbers on top of the music are just too much at once. Maybe if you could turn off the background music and listen only to the numbers or letters, it would make a little more sense."
3,"We use it everyday, but not as a drum.","I bought this toy for my 8 month old daughter. My daughter likes to hit the table or anything in front of her, but not this drum. But I found the other use of it. I bought the drum together with the music table(highly recommend). The drum is perfectly fit the table as a small bench. So we use it everyday, in another way. :)Maybe when she gets bigger, she'll start using it as a drum, so far I'm not regretting to get it."
4,Fun Toy (Age recs a bit off),"We bought this for our 6 month old per the guidelines on the box. He is now closer to 8 months old and just starting to appreciate it. I think at around a year old he will love this toy...it's just a bit advanced for younger babies. You have to hit the drum around the center of the pad and reasonably hard to get it to change letters -- it's not badly designed, but it just requires a bit more coordination than most 6 month olds possess."
2,This Is NOT a Drum...,"We've had this toy for about a year. My son (now 1 old) has never given this toy much play time. I can't say I blame him. I purchased this thinking it would be a good learning toy, but also a drum that he could bang on and make some noise with...not so. While it is a decent learning tool (the letters light up brightly and the voice is clear in it's pronunciation), the drum portion is absolutely useless. When set on the drum setting, banging on it only produces the faintest little tapping noise while lights stream across the top. Those lights will hold his attention for a few minutes, but once he sees that he can't make much noise with it, it gets pushed aside. Overall, I can't say I recommend this. The idea was a good one, but they just didn't execute it very well. If you're looking for a drum, buy a drum. If you're looking for an ABC learning toy, there are many out there, but the two together (at least in this case) just don't make a very exciting toy."
2,leapfrog drun,"After a lot of research, I decided to buy this toy for my 15mos old daughter. She is not interested in it at all. Maybe she's too old or maybe she'll grow into it, but right now she wants nothing to do with it. Overall a waste of money for us."
4,Leap Frog alphabet drum,"I believe this toy is great, only probelm I think it is better for a younger child. My grandson is 17 months old and he just can,t sit still long enough to sit and play, however he does like the portion that plays the music. I would recommend it for a younger tot who has not yet started walking."
2,She's just not that into the toy.,"My now-toddler has had this drum since birth (it was a gift at her baby shower). When she started to crawl, I thought the movement option on it (when you put it on it's side, it's a roller toy that plays music with movement to entice baby to crawl) would make her want to crawl after it...but it didn't. When she learned to sit up on her own, she learned to hit the top for the alphabet option, but lost interest in it quickly. The option to make her own drum sounds didn't quite take off with her either, because the sound of her hitting the drum is soooo soft compared to the pre-programmed music it comes with. I liked that the letters were large and easy to see, but she's just not that into it. Now, she just turns it on herself to hear the music, and lets it play while she goes to her board book collection. I even put it away for a month, thinking she'd ""rediscover"" it when I brought it out again.....nope. I'm sure it's a great learning toy for others...just not mine."
2,Can't hear drumming noise,"We bought this for our 11 month old who, like most babies, loves to bang on things. However, she has shown little interest in it. I wouldn't give it a bad rating for that alone, but our biggest gripe is that you can't hear the drumming sound - which is the whole purpose of the toy! The music (which isn't bad) drowns out the drum, and makes this a glorified radio (that plays the same songs over and over). Don't waste your money."
3,meh!,"I was planning on getting my child a drum because he loves to bang on things, and I got this one because I thought ""Oh, multifunctional! It's a drum AND he can do letters and songs if he wants to."" But in reality the ""drum"" sound is not very appealing whether the machine is off or on. My 18-month old does like the letters and songs, but the diction of the recorded voice is not clear enough to be teaching him anything. I often can't tell what the recorded voice is saying (a problem with MANY electronic toys, I find). I haven't donated this toy to some other unsuspecting mom yet, because my child will at least play with it on his own for 10 minutes, which is not true of all toys. So I think this toy is of reasonable use for giving a poor mom 10 minutes of peace, but I feel it is fairly useless for teaching the child anything. In retrospect, I wish I had gotten a basic ""real"" toy drum, since I think the fun value of that would last longer."
1,Don't do it. They're the worst.,"These sleeves are absolute trash. They stretch and bunch as soon as they get wet from sweat, and slide off. I wear an XL in Rehbands, which I bought after months of fighting this junk, and I couldn't even keep a MEDIUM TK sleeve on. The shape makes no sense, and putting them on is a hair ripping nightmare even if you put them on inside out and flip them around as recommended. They also tear easily and begin to disintegrate after a few months. But don't worry the warranty is good for a whopping 90 days - just shy of the point they're guaranteed to go to pieces."
4,I like,"I don't know how I've been lifting without these. They really help. I've even had a friend try them and he's planning on getting some. The only negative to these are how much you're going to sweat from having them on, but I say it's worth it."
1,"Amazon, Are You Listening?",I searched for Tommie Copper compression sleeves and kept getting these. How come? They are not TommieCopper and are much more expensive. Hmmm.
5,Confidence inspiring knee bands,"I ordered these from Amazon after researching knee wraps/bands from various sources on the internet. These looked like the solution to making lifting with the legs safer than without any aids. I used to have knee pain from squatting without any proper support. These gave me the confidence and ability to squat more safely. They are difficult to put onto your legs and recommend reading the instructions to bend them in half and pull them over and around the knee caps. These are a great product that looks to be built to last, but I've only used them for 3 workouts so far. I ordered size medium and I weigh 180 lbs."
1,Way too tight.,"Ordered 2 pr. knee pads, large, and couldn,t even think about getting them close to knee. Sugests baby powder but didn't want to ruin before sending back. Would have needed miracle powder."
1,God awful,"Coming from an ex pilot, this game gives a high performance jet the manuverability of a Piper Cherokee. I played this game for about 3 minutes, then I was off to EB to trade it in. It might have been a decent game for the Nintendo entertainment system (yes the 8 bit fossil). Save your dough, get a game that is worth it, 'cause this is possibly the worst I've seen yet."
1,Could have been good but it seems rushed,"This game is no where near as good as Ace Combat 4. I might have kept the game if not for one glaring flaw. It will not remember your choice of control setup. There are 4 to choose from. It will remember the setup on the memory card but once you change to a different mission it reverts to the default setup. This should never have gotten by the beta tester. Who ever they are, fire them. Bombing could have been handled better. When you switch to bombs you are switched to a 3rd person view. I found it impossible to fly the aircraft in this view. An arrow that points to your selected target would have been helpful but instead you just get a left/right arrow. With some proper testing and tweaking this really could have been an adequate game. But as it stands I would stay away from it. I wouldn't even buy it in the bargain bin..."
1,NOT SO GOOD.,this game is fun if you like plane games. it has very good planes but the details are not very good. I would not recomend it because it's worst than falcon 4.
3,ehhhhhhhhh,"not bad, but I was a little dissapointed, it wasnt all that much fun, it seems like you are flying a Neuport 17. All the missions are SEAD battles (strike againts anti-air) which stunk, And the AAA tear you up like nothing ive ever seen, The plane detail may be ok for Hornet and Tomcat but once you get to newer jets like the Raptor the design stinks, why does it change to 3rd person view when you bomb how do you expect to hit anythingRent this because it is fun for a little whileDont buy because youll be bored in two days."
3,Top Gun: Combat Zones,"This game was good, but the only thing that was bad about it was the controling. If you are not good with the anolog this is not a game for you. The stearing in the game is like a real jet. In most other jet fighting games when you push the anolog button hard left < or right > you turn really fast but with the top gun controls you do a barrel roll, when you want to turn you have to push down left/right. Itis confusing but it is easy to get the hang of. If your up for a challenge take this game to the limit!"
2,Don't believe the hype,"I played this game at E3 and it was horrible. It was the only game in its area of the show without a line of people waiting to play it. Unless it's revamped by Titus before its release date, I would recommend staying away from this thing. It needs major, major work. It's kind of a bummer because I'm a big Top Gun fan and thought this would be a great game on PS2."
2,Therabead Moist Heat,This product for the money is not worth it. It does not hold heat for more than a couple of minutes no matter how long you microwave it. It's bulky and does not fit into my small microwave. I used to have a homemade rice pack that held heat for and hour. It lasted 4 years with daily use. I guess I'll have to drag out the sewing machine and make another because that worked alot better than this overpriced item.
4,as expected,"this was a replacement for the same product purchased some time ago...very good for the purpose used, that is heat for an injury or in this case for lower back pain relief."
5,Ergonomic doorknob,"I love this little knob. It works great and it was very easy to install. They should call this an ergonomic knob, instead of an egg knob. It's really easy on your wrist. If your hands are moist, it's easy to open the door. I highly recommend this knob."
5,Wonderful Video Calming!,"My children absolutely love this video. This video has several short stories and some subtle lessons. My children sit there and actually watch the whole thing. That's something for them, their 2 and 4 years old. I recommend it. The narrator has a nice soothing voice and the music is calming."
5,Great stuff,"This was a thoroughly enjoyable thriller. Despite knowing the plot I still really liked this.It is very fast paced, well written and even amusing at times.It does require a certain amount of suspension of disbelief but it is so well done that I didn't really notice any of the possible lack of realism.The central character, Leibermann is really well portrayed and makes a welcome change from the usual hero of thrillers.****SLIGHT SPOILER*****With the benefit of hindsight it probably gives too much credit in portraying some of the Nazis who fled to South America as evil geniuses. Josef Mengele seems to have been a psychotic killer rather than a serious scientist and his time in South America was somewhat seedy."
5,The thriller from Levin,"Some reviewers complained this title lacked the excitement of modern thrillers. Who cares? Levin presents a compelling conspiracy more logical than most modern action media. And, no, I am not going to tell you what happens. But, most readers will be paranoid enough to accept the what-if hypothesis and occasionally look over their shoulder. And, while you're at it, watch out for Rosemary's baby. A fun, worthwhile, and even thoughtful read."
3,Delightful light read,"A delightful book, with humor and believable situations. I agree with another reviewer that Gil's casual language is odd, even irritating, but he is such a positive person in other ways that it is minor.I did love the deus ex machina nature of Lady Gilliland. She reminded me of the father who appears in several Loretta Chase books and serves as a secret matchmaker for each of his sons. A really delightful bit of humor and showing that the older generation knows better."
5,Excellent Job Thanks!,The service you provided me was excellent!! Fast and efficient and arrived in perfect condition. thank you!!!!
1,Boogeyman-not very good...Devonsville-sucks.,"The double feature of ""The Boogeyman""/""The Devonsville Terror"" aren't very good horror movies. ""The Boogeyman"" is a Halloween ripoff to a certain degree although there is some variation for sure...as a whole, this movie isn't terrible, but the mirror theme that the movie is essentially based on was pretty stupid in my opinion. The Boogeyman is a ghost confined to a mirror until it is broken and then people start dying at the hands of this Boogeyman...this movie is very slow to develop and the acting is poor.As for the movie called ""The Devonsville Terror"", it sucks! It starts with three witches killed during the Inquisition. These three witches come back to get revenge from the descendants of their murderers. Again, the movie is slow to develop and boring. I don't recommend this DVD to anyone...I'm thoroughly disappointed."
3,Interesting,"My husband and I were expecting something different, but as a story, it was probably a true concept. That was a terrible era in our country. I just wasn't prepared for the sudden ending. Excellent acting by everyone."
1,Unbelievable that this was actually released.,"You will be amazed by the lack of quality within 30 seconds of the start of this film. While a couple of the actors do what they can to make the best out of their parts, Eric Braeden couldn't have done worse if he had just stood there looking into the camera without uttering a word. Armand Asante did a good job as the menacing crooked Sherif and Billy Zane almost pulled off his role as the ne'er-do-well carpet bagger, but the rest of the cast was all over the place.Already crippled by the poor acting and a laughable script, the amateurish production work took this disaster the rest of the way to the bottom. Amazing that while the movie supposedly took place over more than a years time, most of which the protagonist spent in prison either locked in a box or tied to a pole, he managed to maintain the same well trimmed mustache.I am just amazed at how the makers of a movie this bad managed to get the names who were in it to actually show up."
5,Great tips for new (and experienced) eBay sellers,There is a lot of good information in this e-doc. I think that the tips will help anyone who is new to selling items on eBay. The document guides one through the process of writing good marketing descriptions for their sale items. Also included are tips on going through a complete transaction and avoiding some common problems. This short e-doc gets right to the meat. Many bound books contain a lot of filler that one has to wade through to glean useful information.
5,Awesome table,"If there is 1 toy that I can recall has been value for money for my baby girl, is this table. It is amazing toy and very durable and my daughter enjoyed it to the fullest.Plus whenever some kid visit us, they enjoy this toy and even my cousins started liking this toy so much as started to play with it and most of them are 20+... :-)There are review that children tend to use it as stool. But then there are so many things in the house that children learn can be used as a stool... e.g. we bought a small chair for her, she started using that as a stool. At least for this one we can take out the legs."
5,Great learning toy.,Great product. My baby love this toy. It keeps her entertained. Great music and songs. It plays ABC and 123. The only drawback is for baby who just started standing and holding onto objects. My baby would hold onto this and sometimes it tips over.
2,Disappointed,"My son received this table when he was 5 months old. By the time he could actually play with the toy at 11 months old, it no longer worked. THe lights flash but the music will no longer play..the whole point of the table. Needless to say, the toy wasn't overplayed with. It was barely touched for months. I tried two brand new sets of batteries but all Leapfrog wants to say is replace batteries in response. They will not even consider replacing without a receipt. And, their warrantee is a measly 90 days. I will never again purchase a leapfrog toy for my son or for a gift and I will be sure to ask people NOT to buy it for my son in the future. I would recommend you do the same. Fisher price has EXCELLENT customer support and I have found that all my son's Vtec toys hold up my better...even the ones he plays with several times a day."
5,Table turned walker,"Length:: 0:19 MinsWe bought this table for Christmas when my son was 7months. At first we didn't put the legs on but once he was interested in standing he LOVED this toy. He loves turning the pages, spinning the rattle, and of course pouncing on the music keys. It can get annoying which is easily fixed by turning the sound off. My son is now 10months old and still loves this thing. However, he figured out if he pushed this off the rug and onto the hard floors he can use it as a walker! Luckily it doesn't scratch my floors so I let him use this as a walker now but he'll walk with it until he gets stuck on a wall and becomes extremely angry when he can't walk anymore so the table has been in time out a few times."
2,No sound after 2 months,"My daughter liked to play with it. But after two months or so, some parts of the table did not play music. This lasted for a couple of weeks and then no sound at all. My daughter was only 8 month when we got it and obviously she couldn't do anything hard to damage the product. This product does not last long."
2,Didn't Last Two Months!,"Our 9 month old loves this toy, so we want to love it too. Unfortunately, it no longer works after only a month and a half. Looks like we'd have to pay for return/exchange shipping through Amazon or Leapfrog, so we'll have to see if the little guy still likes it without the batteries while we try and seek out a higher quality replacement."
5,WONDERFUL,"I purchased this for my 9 month old nephew and he love it!! He crawls over to it and get much enjoyment out of this table. Its durable, he stands by it and turns the ""pages"" and pushes buttons. Simply enjoys it. So happy I purchased this for him!!"
3,My 18th old baby lost interest already,Only 2 months into this toy and he's already ignoring it. not sure why but toy is so tedious. But then he's more interested in board books.
4,Fun at One!,"My daughter received this for her first birthday. She is still having fun with it multiple times daily. It is the perfect height for her-and she loves all the noises. God help you if this gets switched to Spanish. SO ANNOYING. haha. My biggest issue with this toy is that it is not necessarily musically accurate. I would like this better if it made more ""real"" instrument sounds. Overall she has fun with it-I guess if I want her to have real instruments, I will have to get those :)"
4,Great toy,"My twins looove this toy. I got it when they were around 6 months old, they used to pull themselves up. It is a lot of fun and everything has sounds and music. The only reason why I did not give it 5 stars is because the little door it has broke when they were 8 months. That is 2 months after I got it. It may be because there is two babies, but I would expect it to last longer. They still have a blast anyway. I do recommend this toy"
2,TWO Broke!,"My son loved this toy...until it stopped working. I wrote customer service and they replaced it after many emails back and forth. The replacement was put together, hardly used, and immediately broke in a different way! They refuse to replace it since it was already replaced once, so I'm stuck with two useless broken music tables and as a ""peace offering"" I was given a 15% off code for their online store! I don't want to buy another one even though my son adored this toy, because I am not spending another penny on their junk and poor customer service. An expensive baby toy like this should function well through multiple children, not break immediately upon use TWICE!"
3,good toy but......,I would have loved this toy for my son had it been made a little shorter. He loves playing with it but after he plays he sits and has been hit in the face several times by the edge. I hope they can figure out a way to prevent that.
4,Great Fun and Entertaining!,I purchased this toy at a garage sale for ten dollars and I still would have paid full price for it! My daughter was 9 months when she started playing with it. She is twelve months now and still loves banging the buttons and dancing to the music! This is one of the few toys that still remain to keep her attention and she is pretty rough with it!
3,9 Month Old's Rating,"I just bought this toy an hour ago, brought it home to my newly 9-month old and he immediately pulled himself to stand on the table and almost tipped over the table! To prevent this, I put the table close to the couch so if he tried to pull himself up again, it would have something to lean up against. Other than that, he played with the table for about 7 minutes and then crawled away to something else. Maybe it will take a few days for him to show more interest. I will give him time and hopefully he'll get more enjoyment out of it. I can't lose because this was on sale for $19.99 on Target today!! Oh! Also, I liked the sounds and music but the music started making a ""skipping"" sound like it was stuck...anyone else have problems with this? I will put some more brand new batteries inside and see if there are any improvements...So my rating...? I give it a 3 out of 5 for good music but falls short in other ways."
4,Thought it died after a few months - it didn't!,"My daughter has loved this toy since she was about 6 months old. We thought it wasn't very durable, because it stopped working properly intermittently (she'd push a button, and one of the lights would flash while it made a weird mechanical buzzing noise). We figured out after a few months that it was low batteries causing this problem - replaced them, and it worked perfectly again."
3,Fun Table but BEWARE: legs do NOT detach once attached!,"I was interested in this table because many of my friends purchased for their children and raved about it. I was excited to receive it as a Christmas gift for my 6 month old son. The directions say ""detach legs for floor play"". So, we tested putting the legs on when we opened it and THEY DO NOT DETACH! Therefore my son is unable to play with it unless I hold him standing up to it. We can not have him experience the floor play as I was hoping it would keep him entertained while I cleaned/cooked. My friends table legs detach so it must be a new thing as I emailed Leapfrog and they told me they no longer do. They must not have updated their instruction manual. I was very disappointed. So make sure you DO NOT attach the legs before your infant can stand on their own."
2,Didn't last very long.,Gave as a gift to 1 year old triplets. It broke within 2 weeks. Not very impressed with this product.
5,Amazon Not Fair,"I wrote a heads-up recently concerning this item, but Amazon has opted not to publish it. Is it because I revealed that Target is selling this item for $19.00?"
4,Great toy,"My daughter is 17 months old and loves the LeapFrog Interactive Learn & Groove Musical Table. Out of all the toys that she has that are interactive, this one keeps her attention the longest."
5,Great for babies just learning to stand!,"I like this toy a lot. It is a perfect height for babies just starting to pull up and stand. The sound quality is very good, has English and Spanish, very interactive. Overall great quality. The only gripe I might have is that it isn't very heavy, in the sense that once your babies are very good movers/walkers, they tend to push and slide it around, so increases baby spills...but not in any really alarming way. Still great."
4,Great for learning to stand and play,"We bought this when my daughter was 8 months old to help encourage her to get herself up to standing and pull up in general. It was great for that! There are a lot of different buttons and colors and things to do and my daughter really enjoys playing with it. For the parents the songs get a little old but thats pretty normal. She is now almost 10 months and doesnt spend as much time at it as she did when she was younger but she still goes to it everyday. Only 4 stars for durability because we have only had it 2 months, so we will have to see how it holds up in the long haul."
5,My twins love it!,"My twin boys who are 10.5 months old LOVE this toy! I like that you can take the legs off, and that it has two modes. They really enjoy it and both can share and have a ""side"" to themselves!"
2,Great toy but gets stuck constantly,"Great toy with lots of things to do. However it constantly gets stuck and needs a few days of rest before it comes to itself. By stuck, I mean it gets stuck on one annoying note and won't do any tricks while it it in this mode. We use it mostly for climbing practice at the moment."
5,Great Toy,I bought this item for my granddaughter's first birthday. She is now 21 months old and has played with this item every day. She started out playing with it on the floor and has continued to enjoy it with the legs. I highly recommend this toy. It has certainly been her favorite.
2,Nice but LOUD!,We got this for our daughter and it is a very nice learning table but be warned it only has two volume settings and they are basically Loud and Deafening. It really needs to have both settings adjusted down a full volume level. Unfortunatly as great a toy as this is I think it will be used sparingly to keep us from going insane due to the noise level.
2,Don't put the legs on this table until your little one is ready!!! They don't detach even though the box says they do!!!,My 7 month old really enjoys sittig and playing with this toy (he isn't crawling or pulling up yet). Our 9 month old neighbor who is crawling and pulling up also likes the music table. We put the legs on the table for our 9 month neighbor and it took HOURS and a flat head screwdriver to remove the legs (and my husband was really worried he'd break the legs)! DO NOT PUT THE LEGS ON UNTIL YOUR LITTLE ONE IS READY.
4,Great purchase,This has been a great product for our little one learning to pull himself up. It has enough to keep him while mom makes dinner.
5,Highly recommended,We are very impressed with this toy. It has tons of songs - even if he hits the same key twice it will play something new. We love the English/Spanish feature and my baby can't get enough. He's also been pretty ruthless on it and it hasn't broken.
3,Super cute and fun but moves with the slightest pressure,"My son (and I) love this activity table. It's fun and very interactive and for that I give it 5 stars. However, the legs are not weighted at all so if my son leans against it the slightest bit it moves...I tried pushing it with my pinky and it moved. My son has already fallen down due to this flaw but he, thankfully, didn't land hard and was fine. We have to stay close when he uses it (which kind of defeats the purpose) and have to be very vigiliant about what is around him in case he falls. It really is ashame. We don't want to return it because he really likes it so we are trying to think of a way to get the legs to stay put a little. There isn't a lot of room on the bottom of them so we're still trying to figure it out. Everything else about it great but LeapFrog should definitely think about weighting the legs a bit."
5,10 month old loves this toy!,"My son is 10 months old and he is learning to play standing up. He loves this toy. It has two modes, music and learning. He especially loves the music side. You could also play with this toy during tummy time with a younger child by removing the legs. Great investment! Only wish the legs were a little sturdier."
3,"Fun, Fun, Fun","I purchased this product for my grandson 1 year grandson last year for Christmas. He absolutely loves it! Every time he comes to the house, it was of the first toys he runs to. I like the fact that it has music, numbers, and alphabet. There could have been more than one page to run on the 'book' portion, but he loves it just the same. The height is shorter than I expected. This is a very durable toy because my grandson went through a stage of throwing his toys; he picked this up threw it, has climbed on top of it, has jumped on it when it was upside down! This tables has definitely taken a licking, but it's still ticking and in great shape. It still looks brand new."
3,"Daughter loves it, but quality is unacceptable","My daughter loves this toy, but we are currently on our fourth. After a month or so, each one has stopped playing music correctly and gets ""stuck"" making certain noises over and over. We've replaced it each time, but it has happened three times and I'm waiting for the fourth one to break. This poor quality is unacceptable for a $40 item. Overall, she loves playing with it, but be prepared to request a refund or exchange after a month or two."
2,Sound Broke,"This was a great toy for a few months when our son learned to stand up, but the sound and lights broke. The music would stick and make the same noise over and over again, which was really irritating."
3,"My son loves it, but it needs one small fix!!!","My son loves this little table. The noises and music are only slightly annoying. I do wish the volume went lower. But the issue for me was the fact that the bottom of the legs are just plain hard plastic. So it slides VERY easily on tile, wood or other hard surface floors, which obviously gives very little stability. Even on carpet, it slides but gives him enough stability to stand and walk around it. He is 11 months old and can stand and cruise very well. For a younger child, it would not give enough support to pull up. It would slide right out from under them! I do love this toy. I just wish they would make this one major fix!!! It seems like it would be pretty simple. Too bad :( It could have been really great!"
4,Grand loves this!,Got this for my 11-month old granddaughter for Christmas. She LOVES it. She dances and tries to sing and entertains us all when she is playing with it. Only problem I see is that she scoots it all over the floor as she is learning to walk.
2,Awful Warranty,"This product kept my daughter entertained. I have two issues with it.(1) The table will slide around so you have to put it against a wall or on carpet. Otherwise, when your baby is learning to stand, they might push too hard against it and fall forward.(2) Customer service is awful - the down button on the xylophone stopped working around 4 months and they wouldn't replace it b/c it was past 3 months. I wouldn't expect it to break so quickly and it's not like my daughter was playing rough with it. Their solution was to give me a 15% off discount code that could be found on many websites and that was after I asked for some sort of compensation. Wished I had bought the fisher price one since they have better costumer service."
2,Slightly Disappointed,"This toy eats batteries like crazy! I've gone through two sets of batteries in 3 days. My son only played with it for a short amount of time one night and the next day it wasn't working any longer. Replaced the batteries again with brand new ones, since I had used batteries from a flash light the first time, and the same thing happened. He played with it for a short time, and the next day batteries are dead already. On top of that, it gave him a bloody lip because it tips very easily when he is trying to pull himself up to use it. It needs heavier legs or something. I was really excited to get him a toy he could stand to play at now that he's enjoying being on his feet so much, but it has been quite a disappointment to me and him. He hasn't even showed interest in it since it hurt him, and I hope it hasn't discouraged him from pulling himself up all together. I do not plan on replacing the batteries yet again, only to throw a few more dollars down the drain."
4,It's great but needs improvement...,"My 8 month old son loves to pull up and stand to play with this toy, he loves it. However, I had to put a rubber grip on the legs to keep it from moving since we have wood floor. But for the manufacturer, that will be a good improvement to this product for the future."
2,Tips Over!!!,"I bought this table and within the first hour I had it in my house, my 8 month old tipped it over on to herself!!! She had been standing up playing with it and when she went to let herself sit down (plop on her bottom) she took the table with her. I purchased this item because most of the reviews talked about how sturdy it is! My daughter is 8 months old and still weighs under 20 lbs so she's a petite thing, although strong. I'm going to have to find a way to make the legs heavier so she can't tip it. Overall, I'm extremely disappointed."
5,Highly recommend - worth the money!,"I bought this when my son was 6 months old. Since the legs of the table are removeble, we used only 2 legs and propped the table so he could play while sitting on the floor. Great entertainment! Not hours (like someone here mentioned), but kept him busy for good 20-25 minutes, which is pretty good for a baby. Buttons are easy to push and slide. He loved the book in the middle, too bad it only has 1 page to flip - oh well. Plays like 30 different melodies (they differ based on what page is flipped and what color buttons you push). Now my son is 15 months and is still enjoying playing with the table. Money well spent!"
4,Great toy but could use some portability improvements,"I bought this toy for my daughter when she was about 9 months old. She had one at daycare and seemed to enjoy playing with it. It has served us well and now she's 13 months old. I know it will last us through multiple children! I have 2 suggestions for improvements - 1. there should be rubber on the bottoms of the legs to avoid it being used as push toy, it slips all over if the kid puts any weight on it which can be dangerous; and 2. the legs should be designed so they either fold in half or can be stacked and clipped or clicked into place underneath the top, this would make transporting it 100 times better. Other than that, your child will love this thing!"
4,Great for infants & toddlers,"My daughter has a sensitivy to milk protiens, so this product is great for her. It tastes like orange jello, & goes great with her apple juice. With her being 18mos old, its important she gets a certain amount of calicum. This product lets me give her an accurate dose.The lid does need some improvement. It doesn't have a secure fit, & needs to be cleaned off daily (or after each use). I would not recomend laying it on its side once it has been opened."
2,NOT what I thought!,"Upon receiving this bracelet I discovered that I didn't like it because it appearsthe silver had been painted or applied to it. This is a sure case of "" a picture can be deceiving"". The bracelet had a feel of plastic not metal. I decided it would betoo much trouble to return so I gave it away. No I would NOT recomend this item."
1,AAAAUGH!,I'm sorry that I have to give this album even ONE star. This album is TERRIBLE! I got out of the car after listening to this abomination and felt ripped off. The LAST time I buy a tribute album comprised of a single performer!You've been warned: STAY AWAY!
5,Puts everything within reach,I purchased these turntables for the far reaches of my corner cabinets. It used to be a pain to retrieve anything from these areas. Now everything is easily within reach. I love it! And such an easy fix! I also purchased a smaller one for the cabinet next to the stove to store spices and herbs. No more clutter next to the stove or in the cabinet!
3,oxo good grips 16 inch turntable,"I purchased two. One works great, the other does spin well at all. I didn't call about this as I just moved and was so busy. I don't know if it is exchangeable for one that works well."
4,My son Love's it!,My Son really loves and spends a lot of time making bugs. The only problem is that it needs a funny sized light bulb in order for it to work. The funny size bulb is not included in the kit. Go Figure! We would have rated this product a 5 if it included the bulb and better instructions.
4,Worthwhile contribution to the subject,"Gay and lesbian parenting is a firecracker of an issue that won't go away even when gays and lesbians are free to raise children. This book is an intelligent examination of the subject, although as others have mentioned, it's not necessarily intended for the ""lay"" reader. Nonetheless, it's worth reading for anyone interested in the subject..."
1,Garbage,"If you finally get this thing on, it takes about two days for the stiching (that on the cover, not that you put in) to give way. You would be better off with a paper wrap. A shame we can't give zero stars."
1,You think we're joking.,"If you're one of those people who reads negative product reviews on Amazon and thinks, ""Oh, well, they're probably just computer illiterate or have a really bad computer. I'll give this program the benefit of the doubt because 2 people gave it a high rating,"" then let me add my voice to the tons of people telling you not to take the bait.You think we're joking, but this program really does not work; and there is nothing more frustrating than spending money on a program that is supposed to work on your computer and does not. Also, Roxio ""Support"" is virtually nonexistant.I rarely write reviews, but I've had such a bad experience with this program that I can't help myself. I will never buy anything from Roxio ever again. Please, do yourself a favor and do the same."
1,Flabware that confuses the issue,"I have used CD Creator 5 for quite a while and bought this because of 5's brilliant interface and ease of use. Suffice to say that this program is a considerable downgrade, mainly because it tries to do too many things. Instead of an intuitive interface (I never had to call tech support) there is a welter of choices and options, very few of which made any sense. Unlike 5, there is no manual. Oddly enough, 5 had a manual and didn't need it. As for DVD creation, this is very underpowered. If DVDs are what you want to make, go with Pinnacle Studio 9. DVDs are all it does, and it does them brilliantly. As for making CDs, I uninstalled this hard drive hog and went back to Creator 5."
1,What a piece of trash. Waste of money & time - BEWARE!,"I'm tired of waiting for software that actually works! OK, if I could rate this a negative number I would. Make sure and back up your configuration and drivers before installing this piece of trash. It has destroyed the drivers on both of my computers (laptop and home). Neither computer will create a CD. It doesn't convert music types (and there is downloadable shareware that does this). Lots of fancy screens, lots of fancy words in their product description. Roxio has joined the ranks of so many other PC software creators (marketing, marketing, marketing). DO NOT BUY THIS SOFTWARE. Matter of fact, send me the $100, you'll be better off!!!!!"
4,too much,"Have had several different CD Creators, this one has a lot of goodies with it: more than I needed. Lots of good stuff. Works fine in Windows XP Home edition no gliches that I could find.If you don't need all the extra's might want to try an earlier version:Does exactly what it advertizes and more."
1,counterfeit,The product wont upgrade and Roxio says my version is a counterfeit.This seller new this and ripped me off!!
3,The Simpsons are capitalists!,"While I am still very excited to have some of the best episodes of Treehouse of Horror on DVD, I am so very dissapointed that all the episodes are not here. It's a DVD, for crying out loud!So, while I don't regret shelling out my money for this DVD, it's obvious that The Simpsons are going to squeeze devoted Simpsons fans for every penny they can."
2,Fox is stupid,why does fox not put all of the tree house of horror episodes in one set i would buy that and same for the christmas why are they taking so long to release the dvd box sets i mean ok the comentaries take a while to do but not one year they are realy good so far but why so slow i dont get it why don't they put all the simpsons hallowe'en specials in on set i would definately buy that for shure and why did they cancel family guy that show would have been the next simpsonsI would have given one star but you know it is from the simpsonswho here hates fox
3,Correction to Simpsons comments...,"A correction here, from the ""first time Simson viewer"". My daughters informed me that it is NOT Bart who does the axe murder in one episode on this DVD. Rather, it is HOMER who goes nuts and chops another character to death. There, I stand corrected. Whew! All else the same, though."
4,Good episodes but I'd like more,"Contains the classic, (and insightful), Kang vs. Kodos episode, but I'd like more. The Halloween episodes are among the Simpson's best. I don't see why they couldn't assemble a partial, but current, compilation of Halloween episodes while the series is still in production. I'd buy in."
3,A good value DVD,"I don't reget buying this DVD. If you love the Simpsons, this is a good choice.I agree with the common gripes. Why didn't they release more of the good stuff? A collection of Treehouse of Horror episodes would sell big. I found the lack of good extras disappointing, too. The DVD seemed just thrown together.On the plus side, these probably are the best epidodes of Treehouse of Horror, for a pretty low price. Number V is probably my favorite, and clinched my decision to by the disc.I probably would have given this a two, but I think that the low price brings up the rating. The store price is about half the price of the average new DVD. They aren't trying to pass this off as some ""special edition"" DVD. This is just some of the best episodes of the Simpsons you are going to find on one disc."
3,"Good, but only if you don't plan to buy any of the seasons or if you're a completist.","Alright, what we have here is a somewhat random collection of Simpsons Halloween episodes. The episodes are great, no question about it, but this was a wasted opportunity. Why Matt Groening and co. wanted to release this, I have no idea. As far as I know, Simpsons seasons are selling great, so I wouldn't imagine this is a desperate attempt for money. But if you ask me, if they wanted to make a lot more money, they would have made some big expensive collection of EVERY Halloween episode made up to the point this was released. I think that would be awesome!!! Also, this is nearly osbolete, since every season except for one have been released that contain these episodes. And once the 9th season is released, this won't be worth anything.So, once again, this is good if you're a completist or you don't plan to buy any of the seasons. Otherwise, stay away and buy all the seasons instead."
4,met my expectations,Anouar Brahem once again delivered his mysterious flow of middle eastern music to the listeners ear. bravo...
3,It's cool.,"I'm happy with the quality of the book, the one thing that bummed me out was they didn't have the work book CD! They shipped the book very fast,nice to work with. I would buy from them again.Thanks"
4,"A good reference source - full of ""how to"" details","I was advised to buty this book for a Photoshop CS2 class that I'm taking. The class (8 weeks, 2 1/2 hours/week) covered so much material and went so fast that I (a novice at Photoshop) had difficulty keeping up. The book made all the difference!It covered all the techniques, tricks, and concepts in good detail, and made far more sense than the instructor did. It will serve as a worthwhile rerefence as I get more deeply into Photoshop in the future."
2,Poorly Organized and Hard to Follow,"Superficially Evening's book appears to be all that anybody would ever need about Photoshop CS2. In fact, it is an impossible introduction for people making the jump from a simpler program, say Elements 3.0.The organizational structure is poor.Many ideas are used before they are explained, a fatal flaw as a text, tho' excusable in a pure reference volume. But ""For Photographers"" claims to be a text and not a reference.Terms are slipped in for somewhere without adequate definitions.And neither the table of contents nor the index are detailed enough to help somebody find most detailed topics.I bought Scott Kelby's book after putting Evening's on the shelf, probably for good. Kelby gives the info a photographer making the jump to CS2 requires, although his language is famously just a bit to glib."
3,"The first account of the Wake saga by the only man to serve on Wake, Midway & Guadalcanal","Bayler and Carnes chronicled this piece at arguably the height of the Pacific Campaign. With this in mind, it is important to understand that Last Man contains a fair share of propaganda.As a first-hand account, this book contains some interesting anecdotes, but be prepared to negotiate the typical language characteristics of the 1940s. Also keep in mind that this piece is typically absent of modern political correctness and strongly reveals Bayler's and/or Carne's own sense of racism and cultural relativity.An interesting first-person narrative that contains historically important accounts of three major combat areas.REVIEW EVERY BOOK YOU READ, AUTHORS DESERVE YOUR OPINIONS."
5,Take Care You Get A Complete Version of The Brave,"The Brave is one of my favorite movies: powerful, unforgettable, beautifully filmed, great acting. However, if you need a Region 1 DVD please be very careful what you purchase. There is a Korean distributor whose copy of the film is missing 26 minutes. Its a very different film without those minutes!! A group of us are trying to get a complete region 1 version available in the US, but its going to take a while. I have heard that the VHS from Korea is fine. How can you tell if your missing those minutes? If early on your copy goes from Rafael sitting on a hill overlooking his family's trailer to pulling his kids out of the trailer to see the lights he's strung up -- you've been had. There is 20 whole minutes between those two scenes. So, buyer beware."
5,A pleasing and beautiful movie,The script was well written.. This is easily one of the best movies I've watched. I love how the story moves and how they narrate and justify both main characters. Very Enjoyable and very different from typical movies you watch. I loved it. I love it so much I would watch it again and again.
2,Leave the good one alone,Typical poor remake of a good thing. Felt that it actually undermind and belittle the original movie which was excellent.
4,Footloose,I was pleasantly surprised that this movie was as good as it was. I expected to be disappointed because I liked the original so much. I thought the movie was extremely well made and well acted.
3,Original Is Better,I'm not a fan of remakes. They changed the story line a bit too much for me. The original version was better and will always be my favorite.
2,another lame re-make,"This was an updated, yet not so great, version of the Kevin Bacon classic, with many of the same scenes from the original, and some similar ones as well. At least Julianne Houghe is nice to look at lol. The original is so much better."
2,Not quite laughably bad,"I never saw the original and having seen this, I will not be. It's supposed to be a dance movie, but there's not much dancing. The acting from the leads is pretty terrible. The protagonist's accent comes and goes throughout the movie. Whenever someone mentions Boston, he'll remember that he's supposed to have the accent, but the rest of the time, it's just flat. Julianne Hough is cute, but not a great actress, and she doesn't get to show off much dancing, which seems like a shame. I thought it was fun seeing the Deadwood reunion between Ray McKinnon and Kim Dickens, but that's certainly not enough to recommend that anyone sit through this movie."
3,Solid remake,"Unlike the recent Fame reboot, this remake provides solid retelling of the town where dancing has been banned. The story and characters mirror the original pretty faithfully, and the actors cast, although they harbor similarities to the actors we remember, has found a way to own their roles. I didn't think I'd enjoy the movie as much as I did. Try it, you'll be pleasantly surprised."
1,HATE REMAKES,"Well sometimes 20 words is too much for these reviews. I can't stand remakes as a general rule, but some are okay. THIS is not one of those. It is horrible the way they changed the story. It completely lacks the magic of the original, so do yourself a huge favor and watch that one instead. I cringe that this terrible movie is even billed as the same as the first one."
2,Bad,"Nothing like the original, should have tried to make an original movie instead of trying to copy one better luck next time"
1,I may have liked it had I not seen the original,"Oh, I had a hard time with this movie. I heard it was nothing like the original, but it wasn't even in the same league as the original footloose. I'm not one who doesn't like movies redone, because I do, and footloose was one of my favorite movies as a teen, but this one irritated me so bad. So, instead of the tractor race, they have a school bus race on a track. The amazing scene in the first one where he dances all over the empty warehouse was terrible. The music for the most part was terrible. They had some original, but not much. I was so disapointed in this movie. There was some great dancing, but not even enough to make it worth the 15 bucks I paid for this. What a complete bummer. I wish I would've read reviews before purchasing."
4,Nice Blend,Nice blend of old Footloose into a contemporary milieu. iPod with beat up VW bug. Older sounds with contemporary sounds. Older dance with contemporary style dance. Acting was naturalistic and not overly pop Hollywood. Overall just nicely scripted. Suggest seeing the original first then this redux update.
2,BLah,I hated the girl. Acting was Mehhhhhhhhhhhh~Dancing was Mehhhh too.Not as good as the original. go watch the original.
2,A very confused albeit 'fun' attempt at remaking a childhood favorite,"No where near the original, and it gets confused throughout the movie - from playing modern hip hop in their cars and new country pop in the bar, to having a 1st gen ipod and everyone talking about cell phones but only showing the old rotary dial landlines of the 80's, to them breaking out a tape deck to play the 'music they aren't supposed to listen to'. In effect, I didn't know if it was a failed attempt at imitating the kitsch of ""Napoleon Dynamite"", or if they really were just too lazy to decide if it was the 80's or modern day. I suspect the former, but who knows...The movie does have it's moments though...in all 10min of actual dancing, and in one line that came out right...""Play fair, punk!"" made me laugh out loud, and the choreography at the end is great. The rest of the movie is better suited to entertain small children...that is, if you don't mind your kids looking up to a swearing, disrespectful ballerina."
4,"Great, fun movie!","OK, so Julianne Hough stole the show. I knew she could sing and dance like crazy, but her acting was amazing. What a talent she is. I'll bet Derek, her brother, could be right up there, too if he had the same opportunity. Anyway, this is a fun remake and Dennis Quaid made a great Dad, but Julianne really stole the show."
2,Stick with the original,Loved the original movie way back when with Kevin Bacon- so thought I might like this one. A friend who hadn't seen the original watched it with me.A fourth of the way through we were already wanting it to be over. I guess the acting is OK- but this movie is really for teenagers.I'm assuming all these raving reviews are from that age group.This is not a movie your kids should be watching. At least 13 and up in my opinion.Sometimes Holywood should leave well enough alone. Oh- and my friend who hadn't seen the original hated this one.Wish I could get that almost 2 hours of my life back!
1,ZZZZZZZ,"Since I liked the original, thought I'd give this a try. Didn't even make it through the credits. Sometimes it's best to leave well enough alone."
5,great service,"received my order quickly, great service what else can i say. received my order quickly, great service what else can i say"
3,Tavist antihistamine,This is the Best price that I've found not only online but also in stores and it does the job!
2,Some good ideas,"There are some good ideas in the book, but some of these ideas are free on the website provided in the book. There is also a sample in the intro pages of the book about a pillow made from a design on a tissue box, but no instructions on how to replicate the project."
2,Remember to always be true,"In keeping with the truth, I must say it's a lovely book just too old for the younger set and too little for the older set."
2,writing does not match achievement,"This is a difficult review for me to write, because I have much admiration and respect for Ms. Deeds and her accomplishment of hiking the entire Appalachian Trail. I was very excited to read this book, because I have hiked parts of the trail and enjoyed other books about hikes by through hikers. Unfortunately, the writing does not rise to the level of the achievements. There are many little anecdotes about other hikers, and experiences, but the descriptions of the surroundings, the trail itself, and even Ms. Deeds' inner journey are skimpy and wooden. This is worth reading for a person planning a through hike, but otherwise there are better personal adventure books."
1,Totally Useless,"I had mixed feelings from the reviews when I set out to order this book and, in retrospect, I should've listened to my gut.This book is so full of typo's that it should've never hit the presses. I could live with that if the material had any benefit regarding the subject at hand, but it didn't.The author may have risk management credentials from his work experience but they never translated to the written page. Totally useless !!!!!"
5,Beautiful and intimate,Thanks to Peter Roberts for this beautiful and intimate look at a month in the life of these handsome birds as they mate and launch their offspring into world. I would not have imagined ever seeing a fight between a loon and a beaver! The film maker's commentary is particularly interesting.
1,purely bad thriller,While the title Jill the reaper will entice or even shock you the truth is the opposite Dolph Lundgren plays a cop trying to stop a serial killer a female serial killer. The main actor does okay on playing a cop but the story itself cannot be saved and truly it needed some rewriting.
3,Dolph Lundgren does have acting talent.,Dolph never was a good actor only Blackjack and The Punisher were his moments of good unless he played a villian. but with Jill The Ripper he is the only reason to see such a bizarre film. Lundgren and Brett have on screen chemistry.
3,Another add to my collection.,Good information on techniques. I find myself going back to look at the examples. It's a nice add to my collection of books.
5,Oscelot Weight-lifting Gloves,"The Oscelot weight-lifting gloves (available both with or without wrist-strap) are well made with the needs of the serious lifter in mind. The leather is supple and the mesh back provides the required ventilation. Most important, extra padding is provided in the most needed areas: the thenar (base of thumb), palm, and on the fingers just past the distal interphalangeals (the last nuckles), and the distal phalanx on the thumb (the ""fat"" of the thumb). This extra padding both helps to grip the weight-bar more securely and provides relief. Plus, they look good too! I would, however, recommend any buyer to purchase one side larger than their normal glove size as they seem to run slightly on the small size."
4,Cultivating Communities of Practice (Purchased on 07/09/2009),Great book on utilizing principles of Community Development in managing an organization. Including all stakeholders is so very pertinent.
5,Cat Who series--1st timer for LJB,"I ordered this book for my mom, who thoroughly enjoyed all three books within this one book. This was her first exposure to Lillian Jackson Braun, and now she is hooked. She lives in assisted living and has limited ability to get out and shop for herself, so I especially appreciate being able to order from my computer and have books sent to her from Amazon. The process is easy and I can check my prior orders to be sure I don't duplicate books, and she enjoys the surprise of an occasional package with something fun inside. Thanks, LJB and Amazon."
5,cat-alicious,I am enjoying the Lillian Braun Ct books. simple but a little mysterious & you get to know the characters easily
1,Don't be fooled!,"These are like sodas and fast food. The one ""normal"" size they sell is actually extra large. Returned this one, and still haven't found one small enough."
5,classic,"Has littered the floor of my bathroom for years, I love it. I like picking up old issues and re-reading them too."
2,Lower Price Available,Shortly after ordering Guns & Ammo at what I thought was the best price I discovered that the card inside the magazine offers a better price. I tried canceling the order with Amazon nine hours after I placed it but it was too late. I'm simply posting this so others will know that you can get Guns & Ammo for $10 per year via the card in the magazine.
2,Slower Than Molasses/No Customer Svs,"I ordered this subscription in Dec 2010 & it is now Feb 7th & still not received my first mag. I wrote to then indicating that I saw the Jan issue and since my ETA on the 1st mag was Feb 2011 can I buy the Jan issue if I was not going to receive it. No attempt to answer my question. I am totally dis-satisfied with this mag and will not ever buy it again. Also, read on the web that they have no real evidence for evaluating ammo since they use non-scientific means in doing so and have no clue on ballistics.....THIS WILL BE MY LAST YEAR ORDERING THIS RAG"
1,hasnt shiped yet!!!!!,i subcribed to this magazine to send to my father for his birthday. i ordered in mid august and it is now october and no word from them yet...no magazine...i have many subscriptions and this is the only one that hasnt shipped in an appropriate amount of time! grrr
2,2 1/2 MONTHS TO GET THE FIRST ISSUE???,Subscribed on April 18th - still have not yet received the 1st issue as of June 10TH ! I'm being informed that the first issue is now expected on July 5th. Why so long?? Be advised of this slow service.
3,Kinda Small,The cake pan was a little on the small side. Maybe i didn't read it close enough but i was expecting a larger pan.
5,Loved it ! hope we have season 2 coming up soon !,"I loved Political Animals, interesting drama series and great actors. Sigourney Weaver are fantastic as Secretary of State, and I can not wait for her to be President !"
3,Good book,"This is a good overall review of the subject. Contrary to what the title says, the book is very light on math. If you want to do serious work in this area, you'll need some more in depth references, but this book gets you started, and points you to the references you'll need."
2,It DOES break!!,"This item DOES break! It comes in two pieces, one unbreakable front piece, and one BREAKABLE, hard-plastic back piece. The front piece hangs off of two tiny support hooks on the back piece that appear too weak to handle any kind of weight.While trying to adjust its position, the file came off and fell 3 feet to my hard floor, and BOTH of the support hooks on the back piece promptly broke off, making it impossible to hang the front piece anymore. I had to resort to using double-sided tape to keep the two pieces together.If you have a soft floor, dropping the file should not be an issue. But, with a hard floor, I recommend using double-sided tape to attach the two pieces to lessen the chance of the support hooks breaking if the file falls to the floor."
5,highly recommend,This book is even better than I expected. I couldn't put it down. I will be keeping this book around and rereading it.
2,Very slow camera.,"Picture quality is excellent, especially for a 4 mp camera. The problem is, even with a high speed (80x) SD card installed it takes 5-6 seconds for the picture to save; even when taking low res pictures (that doesn't sound like much unless you consider the millisecond that a kid is able to hold still and look at the camera). When I researched SD cards, I discovered that a high speed card, should be able to transfer data at 8-10 megs a second so I'm not sure why the 4100 is only able to transfer 1/2 a meg per second.Nikon support states that the test camera they have there also saves at that rate.My Dad's 5 mp HP camera saves pictures in less than 2 seconds :("
1,Snail,"If you ever want to photograph some events or occations where you cant say 'can you please pose for me?' dont buy this camera. This is the slowest camera I have seen. You WILL miss some actions for sure.For Indoor photos, you need to use the flash, almost always. Else it gives blurr. This eats up the battery lifeIt has the other features as you can see in the specifications.Nikon itself came out with a new 4.0 MP model and ignores coolpix 4100 and that says it all."
2,Poor customer service,"This was a great little camera until the screen turned blck, and looked like it was shattered. We sent it in to the dealer, hoping to have it replaced as it was under warranty. They would not honor the warranty, and said Labor costs would be 180.00, plus 12.00 shipping, plus almost 8.00 tax for the repair!!! (Almost as much as the camera cost).... After many emails back and forth, they could only offer 20% 'good will' discount. We were very disappointed that they would not try to do more to keep a satisfied customer. We will never buy another Nikon."
4,"Consistant, fun, old school Marvel comics!","By the time I got to this volume of IRON MAN I had begun to really enjoy Gene Colan's artwork. He is replaced partway through this collection by Johnny Craig and then the combination of George Tuska and Johnny Craig. I found all the art teams to be quite enjoyable! Within these pages you will see Tony Stark struggle to maintain his secret identity, further development of Iron Man's supporting cast including Pepper Potts and Happy Hogan as well as the introduction of SHIELD agent Jasper Sitwell (who I found to be a surprisingly good character). Villains face include the Mandarin, Unicorn, the Black Knight, Titanium Man, Mole Man, Grey Gargoyle, the introduction of Whiplash and more!"
5,Ceiling Mount,This is the best ceiling mount anywhere! Its pricey but you pay for what you get and this product is well worth the price. Absolutely no worries.
2,Overall good but limited,"We have this printer and have been impressed overall. One thing to note however--HP has purposively not allowed the user to set printer settings to greyscale in order to try to get you to use the [more expensive] color ink. So if you want to print in black and white, each time you print you have to open up the printer setup and change it to ""print in greyscale"". What a pain in the neck, I don't think inconveniencing the user should be part of a business model but this appears to be the case with hp...would welcome any advice from anybody who has been able to get around this limitation, hp technical support was unable to help. other than that the printer is pretty good, doesn't jam often."
2,INCOMING FORCES,Had a hard time getting this game to work on my computer although I was eventually successful. They went overboard on making it difficult to install and get to function properly. Bad copy of what originally was a decent game. I bought it because my original disk became to damaged to function and the original game manufacturer no longer sold this game.
4,Works fine. Comfortable.,Adjustable armband is comfortable. Works better for working out than a case that clips to your waist because it keeps the cord more out of your way and doesn't pull on your waist. Needs to be laundered occassionally.
2,"Defective Product, don't buy.",I had the same problem where the glue inside the case was exposed and stuck to my iphone. It made case removal difficult and cleaning the iphone a pain. I would not recommend this product. I gave is 2 stars because I liked the look of it but the built quality is shoddy.
4,"Different sounds, but still rockable!","If you love punk rock, mixed with hip-hop and rap, volume and scratches, or if you love the Phunk Junkeez, this album will satisfy you. Disko Danny D informed me that there is a deeper meaning to the songs, so listen to this cd over and over again, and maybe you'll pick up on some of it! Even if you don't who cares! It's a great cd from a great band!"
4,SATIN PAJAMA,"SOFT AND SLICK LIKE SILK. EASY TO TURNOVER IN BED. GREAT PRODUCT, HIGHLY RECOMMEND. MAZENC"
5,Intimo Men's Classic Satin Sleep Pant - Very Comfortable.,"Found the 'Intimo Men's Classic Satin Sleepware' very Comfortable, of Good Quality and I highly recommend them. I liked them so much, I bought four extra pairs, in the different colours."
5,Kindled my interest in mathematics,"My father gave me this book in 1958. It inspired me to think more about things in terms of numbers and puzzles. I truly believe it started my interest in perception, and being aware of how people use abstract reasoning to solve problems. I think it changed my life and my ability to understand the world in a new way and increased my general I.Q. at the time. That is quite a bit for a 123 page book! Good illustrations and index.The puzzles, riddles and tricks are not all about numbers. It is fun and entertaining. A perfect gift for a young person."
5,Grandson will love it,"Good detail on the base but the lamp shade is just semi-transparent plastic, still looks very nice tho."
2,nice dog,"a nice story, but bad acting, by a few of the ""b"" stars. a bit thin in the story line, it should be more of a childrens walt disney movie , on a tight budget. the dog steals the show. so does the scenery. the little girl needs more acting lessons, she was the directors daughter, and it shows. next time get a real star. with some personality."
2,Use Caution,"Was sent wrong parts, as per my mechanic, return procedures, nightmarish and costly, I lost money on restocking fees. However, the prices were affordable, my suggestion, use a local source to get specific part/model numbers, then use your computer to shop. DO NOT RELY ON THE VENDER YOU ARE DEALING WITH, to give you the right part."
4,Simple Understanding,"This book just makes sense. The cases and explanations are wonderful and make it easy to understand a complicated issue. This is not an instruction manual. It makes the nature of addictions clear. I would have liked a suggestion on how to help someone you know that was suffering from and addiction. However, the book brought a whole new sense of understanding. Very well written and easy to read!"
3,Nice fit!,"Thin but it fits! Hopefully it will last through the winter. Actually, I was really thinking for the price the material could have been made using a more weather resistant type of material."
4,Better quality than previous version,"We bought a previous version made of cheaper material which was ripped after not too long, this new version is sturdier and looks well"
2,Char Griller Cover 5555,"This cover is not one which will last several seasons, especially if you live in an area where it snows. I have purchased a new cover every year for the past three years, but for only $20 I can't see complaining. A canvas cover [if one were made for the Char-Griller Pro] would cost at least three times that [if not more], and would succumb within three years to the weather & UV light as well. I have not yet found a canvas cover for the Char Griller Pro, so this vinyl one seems to be the only option. My grill stays on my back patio, and is therefore exposed to the sun, rain, snow and wind. This cover will fade due to UV exposure, and it will tear especially in strong winds. For the price, it's better than using no cover at all! If you have the option of taking your grill into a covered porch, patio, or garage, I suspect this cover would last a bit longer."
4,fits a little snug but does the job,"Fits my grill pretty good but if you have the side burner it fits a little too snug, but it works well."
5,Great cover,"I was nervous purchasing this, mostly because of it's price being so low.When I received it I was so happy to find the quality material and build of the cover and the excellent fit.I have used it for 2 years and it has stayed in very nice shape, even with it having to fair the elements.I don't have the cover anymore since I lost it in a storm do to my stupidity of not having it on the grill.This spring I will be looking for another one.Loved it, I would recommend it to anyone."
1,Lasted about a year,"The cover faded and ripped in several places after being outside for a year (in Austin, TX). I'm now looking for something to replace it, but I won't be buying another one of these covers."
1,Not what it says!,"We purchased this same cover from Lowe's last year and it didn't last the year. It faded and disintigrated. The original cover that came with the BBQ was vinyl and lasted for years! I just purchased this one from Amazon because the description says ""vinyl"". It is NOT vinyl!!! It is the same crappy one that I bought from Lowe's last year. CHANGE YOUR DESCRIPTION!!!! I wish I could find the original cover that came with it when we purchased it 8 years ago. What a waste of money!!!"
1,Doesn't Hold Up Well In The Heat Either,"This cover is definitely affordable, and it fits the grill perfectly. The problem with it is the same problem everybody seems to have with it - durability. Granted, we have very hot summers here in Arizona, but it was tearing every time it was taken off or put back on the grill halfway through it's first summer. This was never stored in direct sunlight either, it just couldn't deal with the heat. Going by the other reviews, it doesn't hold up in the cold either. Great idea, but very poor execution. I am very disappointed in this product, although the grill is still awesome. Either plan on buying one or two of these a year, or get yourself a tarp to cover your grill. Not recommended."
4,A Treasure of Ideas for Teaching Storytelling,"Simi and Cordi have given us a treasure of activities, resources, and ways to organize the teaching of storytelling. From the Table of Contents to the Storytelling Resources the book is written with clarity and excellent organization. The extensive activities and reproducible pages make it easy and exciting to plan classroom instruction. This is a step by step program with lots of room for imagination and creative planning."
1,Not a very good book,"I have been a Huge fan of Lisa Jackson, I have read every single book of hers and this one is by far the WORST book I have ever read. It takes so long to get into the book. And the big huge shocker that everyone is writing about was SO obvious I couldn't believe it. It is too obvious what is wrong with Caitlyn, so easy to figure out the first time it happens and it is so obvious who Sugar is having an affair with. Also, the killer, come on, way too easy to figure out. I can't even believe that Lisa Jackson could write a bad book let alone a horrible one. I am a huge fan and i'm sorry but this book was HORRIBLE. Way too easy to figure out all the ""surprises"" they were too obvious."
5,Awesome Read!!!,"I'm not a big romantic suspense reader, but this was absolutely fantastic. I kept thinking I had a clue to the real identity of the killer, and then I changed my mind. Talk about saving the best for last. Just might keep this one and read it again sometime"
4,Real interesting one!,"I truly enjoyed this western tale by Hubbard. For one, I learned something from it. The historical facts are very interesting. For another, it pulled me right on through. Short and fast adventure read. I could say for any western fan or non-western fan (your never a western fan till you read a great western) you will get glued to this one."
2,Good attempt,"I can commend them for at least trying to put some meaning into the song, which they did, but doesn't that one line get a little too repetitive? They sum up the message 40 some odd times in a 3 minute song with one elongated sentence."
5,solid quality,"This fixture is a lovely quality, nice and solid looking and easy to install. It looks best with a fat lightbulb because the shade is a bit larger than other one-bulb shades and a regular bulb looks small. I love the way it looks with my cast iron accessories. It's hanging over my kitchen sink and gives nice warm lighting to the area. I installed it pointing down, and it worked great!"
4,A Great Blend of What Jonn knows best &Native American Music,"I've been a long time fan of Jonn's space music. This is a great blend of what he knows best and the blending of Native American music. If you meditate, this will take you to the realm of Native American spirituality."
1,Good coverage for grill and charcoal box......,....but ripped about a month after we got it. Not sure why you would create a cover designed to protect a grill from the outdoor elements that deteriorates (sp?) so quickly.
1,"Please Char-Griller, make a fabric cover!!!","I love my Char-Griller 2137, I have one at home and one at the beach house. However, this cover has to be replaced every year, it's like a bad joke, it just disintegrates in the sun. I'd happily spend more to get a premium cover that would not fall apart, but as it is, within a few years I will have spent more on these terrible covers than I did on the grills themselves. I only wish I could give 0 stars. If anyone ever finds an aftermarket cover that fits this grill with the side smoker attached, please post that information here."
2,"Nice fit, not durable..","I bought mine directly from CG. A much thicker material than the one they were selling originally no doubt due to the many customer complaints of poor wearing. While the newer version is a much nicer cover, it still does not last. I keep mine under a permanent covered patio so it only gets partial morning sun and no snow/rain. Mine has worn in the front area where is is in close contact to the lid handle. I think if they put reinforcement patches at the edges/corners where it will rub against the BBQ this would be a much more durable cover. I can't imagine how long it would have lasted if I had kept it out unprotected."
1,can't rate it,"Cannot rate this product, because I never received it. I sure can rate the place I bought it, thumbs down. Did get a refund from Amazon guarantee."
5,Springbok City Market puzzle,This was a gift for a favorite brother-in-law. I give him a puzzle every year and buy nothing but Springbok because of the quality and variety. He loved it!
5,Loved it,I loved this book! The world that Croggon creates is so thourough that I think you'd have to look hard to find holes. I couldn't put it down!
3,"Confused, please enlighten me","Hi, this is not a review as I bought the book yesterday and have not started reading it yet... it is stock for my upcoming holiday. I have a book called ""The Gift - The First Book of the the Pellinor"" and on amazon it is called ""The Naming"". Why the change of title?The bookstore had the 3rd and 4th book but typically not the second, so I can't say whether all the titles have changed. Doesn't it drive you nuts when book stores don't have enough stock of the whole series!!Anyway, please can someone explain the mystery.Thanks"
5,relationships(mother/daughter ),As one that never had a good relationship with her own mom. Until later in life. I would tell anyone that have relationship issue to read this book. It one that your heart will keep pulling you back to once you put it down.
2,eh,"Got these for my son who loves bath time. At 8 months he didn't pay much attention to them and at 1 year he still doesn't. Occasionally he'll hold them in his hands and shake them-esp the one with little colored pebbles inside the plastic. He really only enjoys them when I do things like toss them in the water and make splashes. Otherwise, doesn't hold his interest much. Cute concept just for my son he didn't find them interesting."
4,Cute turtles...,"and the only thing that got my son's switch to the ""big boy tub"" to be less scary. I wish they didn't flip over so much...but they are all different and very cute toys."
4,Nice rice milk,I'm allergic to all dairy and soy. Finally I found a dairy free milk that tastes good and not like dish water. thanks.
3,David Frye IS Bill Clinton!,"For those who thought David Frye disappeared with Richard Nixon, good news: he's back, and the best Bill Clinton impersonator you have ever heard. Unfortunately, the writing on this album is inconsistent, but the funny bits -- and there are plenty of them -- are as good as the best of Frye's Nixon send-ups from the 1970's. The album even correctly predicts Bob Dole coming out as a spokesman for Viagra! If you liked Frye's Nixon, you will enjoy this most recent poke at the President."
3,bought somewhere else,"i bought these shelves from somewhere else and i'm missing pieces, any of past buyers please tell me what type of nails or screws to use!?!?!?!?! please!"
5,great,"this book came in reasonable time, bought it 2nd hand,lots of highlighting, and i kind of like it because it is a text.makes first scan easy.and im very happy i can get a book like this for one buck.yippie. thanks"
1,Poorly edited and incoherent,"Based on the reviews here, I thought this might be a decent book to get my feet wet on game programming. I'm an advanced C# business application programmer by trade, but thought the simple approach would be a great refresher while taking me into a new programming area.Unfortunately, this book is the most poorly written computer book I've ever read. The writing is incoherent and a spate of bad editing throughout chapters 1 and 2 make me wonder if this book even *had* an editor.There are several places where the sample C# program listing have syntax or other errors (such as mixed case variable names in the same section that it explains how this can cause problems).Also, the general organization of the concepts is horrible. It darts all around in the introduction to C#, leaving some concepts unexplained after talking about their significance.As a seasoned C# programmer, let me assure you, this book is NOT an adequate introduction to programming, game or otherwise."
2,Get a decent publisher,"Imagine a book typed on a Canon Starwriter without formatting or spell/grammer check and printed on a printer with a defective toner cartridge....well that is what you get with this book. The exceptionally poor presentation is not a reflection on content, however, it does distract one from the quality of the information contained in the book. The rating I have provided is for content and most certainly not for presentation.Caution - do not buy this book if you are offended by spelling errors, grammatical errors, poor formatting, faded/distorted print quality and considerable lack of attention to detail."
3,Recording quality not up to par,"Unfortunately, I also own the Philips version of Handel's Water Music performed by Marriner/ASMF. The sound quality from Philips is far superior. All the details and crisp highs are missing in this recording from Hanssler. I'd give it 4.5 stars for the music and interpretation. But for sound quality, I only give it 3."
1,Product odor is so strong,"The product has very strong odor, you can't wash it off from your hands with soap and water just doing it once. The whole car is full of the smell of vinil or whatever it made of. Make my wife and kids throw up. Walking into Wal-mart, you will find product with thicker padded soft material and odorless, no need to drive with all windows down."
4,"Hard as heck to get on, but its great other than that!","Nearly broke my fingers trying to get this stearing wheel grip on my car. I had to use a butter knife, and all my upper body strength to get it on. But Item is durable, I will give it that!"
4,Steering wheel cover,"This has a snug fit like it should, it was a little hard to get it on the steering wheel but works great."
3,The best book ever? Not.,"The book is a pageturner, no question. Still it was a thriller, NOT a masterpiece! I must congratulate Mr. Garland on a brilliant psycho-thriller that definately got into and under this veteran traveler's skin. I felt a been-there-done-that-jesus-that-could-have-been-me-and-I-know-those-people, kind of feeling the whole way through. Its a good read. Its worth it. But it should be compared with the likes of Stephen King, NOT Golding or Huxley."
4,X-pose,"Don't make the mistake of expecting anything from this book. Simply read it as if you were listening to a young man retell an experience. Don't dissect it for literary merit or compare it to other works. It stands alone as a definitive piece for this generation. This is what makes it so good. We see who these people are, what makes them tick, their affections, delusions, the substance of their hearts. It made me shudder as I read it and I felt sad to know there really are people who could have an experience of such tragic magnitude, not only the loss of life, but the loss of identity, morals, and the absence of conscious.I took it with me to Pelee Island, a small island on Lake Erie that belongs to Ontario. I sat back in an Adirondack chair sipping wine and truly enjoyed it."
5,"Adam, Eve and Piggy too!","Thank god for Alex Garland! He grabbed me by the shoulders, slapped my face, told me to pull myself up by my boot straps and re-ignited my passion for the written word.He deftly narrates his tale as though you were sitting right alongside him in a seedy, sweltering Thai bar sharing a beer and a cigarette. Garland captures the essence of the traveler -- no need for journals, photographs and tourists. The only thing that's important is what you remember because after all if you can't remember why should it bear retelling or reliving? And what the protagonist remembers is a startling, savage, beastly tale that is equal parts ""Platoon,"" ""Blue Lagoon"" and ""Lord of the Flies."" Odd huh? Intriguing no? Read it"
2,Utter tosh but quite engaging,"This is really little better than Jeffrey Archer. I found it an engaging read but ultimately wholly implausible, full of dead ends of undeveloped plot and written in a rather pedestrian prose. Simply quoting Conrad won't buy you any credibility here. We are meant to believe that life on the Island is some sort of paradise though it sounds suffocatingly boring and I really can't imagine these youngsters putting up with it. The idea that the whole thing was tolerated by some PC drug dealers is laughable. The one real moment of tension is Richard's surfacing in the unexpected air hole but that turns out to be unimportant. Lousy plotting. Hopeless. Read Sam Shepard's Cruising Paradise if you want to know how to write."
1,Thumbs down,"I really enjoyed the beginning of the book, but unfortunately it got more and more annoying the further I got. Because I normally don't put down a book when I'm in the middle of it, I worked my way through it (maybe hoping for a change for the good), but when I finally finished it I was mad and felt like I had been made a fool of. There was nothing in the characters that made me want to like or dislike them, nothing in the story that touched me positively. It was just a waste of time."
4,"Mrs. Kane, here is my review","The Beach was an interesting book. I thought it had wonderful descriptive writing. The author, Alex Garland used great language to describe Mr. Duck. The story is something that sounds like it would be fun for a while, but overall, very scary. The main character, Richard is staying in a small hotel in Bangkok. The man in the room next door gives him a map to a secret island. Richard, and two others set off to find the island. The plot was a little far fetched but that just added to the excitement. I don't want to give away the ending, but believe me, you won't be disappointed. Alex Garland also wrote The Tesseract, and I'm thinking of reading that one, since this was such a great book. One thing about this book is that it has some mature themes in it, like suicide, drugs, and bad language. If that doesn't bother you, you should definetly read this book."
3,Captures the flavor of an uncertain Asia at millenium's end,"Garland has pieced together a haunting document of what it's like to be a desperate, irrational and doped up outsider looking for escape. What could have been a gratuitous travelogue of jingoistic ""helpful phrases"" turns into a brilliant chronicle of the paradox that is South East Asia."
3,Preferences,"It's not something I normally say, but I prefer the movie to the book...it's got more flair, if a little less guts."
3,A disappointment,This book was recommended to me. I found it to be a disappointment. It was a great concept and ok story but it lacked the suspense that other authors can give. It is certainly an over-rated book.
3,better than the movie,I remember this movie being a stinker so I only reluctantly picked up the book. I was pleasantly surprised that it is quite a bit better if still not great. The author was in his early 20s when he wrote it and it shows. The writing is good it's just a bit juvenile in parts. Overall it's a pretty solid adventure with a great location. I might be tempted to check out some more of Garland's books.
2,"Boring, reads like a screenplay","The Beach has all the makings of a great novel - original story, interesting environment,etc. - but the writing is so dry that I could care less about any of the characters. This book was written with one philosophy in mind - concerning pop culture - but with these one dimensional characters I really didn't care about the author's views. I'm sure Leonardo Di Caprio will be perfect for the film. Hell, the screenplay was written even before it was adapted. Boring stuff."
2,can you say OVER-RATED!!!,"While in Italy a ""friend"" recommended this book. Anyone who has ever traveled alone, like Richard in Garland's waste of shelf spacing, knows how shallow friendships on the road really are, and this was no exception...Oh and speaking of shallow, this book is a farce! I only wish the story was only half as deep as the lagoon that provides the utopia with substance!Garland makes a number of vain attempts to be sharp and witty, neither flies well! His stereotypes are juvenile, pathetic, and bothered me to no end! The only portion of the plot that was of interest (conflict between Richard and his French companions) fizzed out faster than Crition's ""Andromeda Strain.""In short, wait for the movie to come to a blockbuster near you, and don't get your hopes up!As for this book as a whole...I still have the scars!"
5,Just a great book.,"I found myself, when I was at work, unable to wait to get home to continue reading. I purposely did not take it to work with me because I was afraid I would be interrupted! Just an incredible read. I have a very good friend who went to Indonesia as a backpacker, and stayed. He is now, after traveling around, teaching english in Jakarta. I love this book."
5,An excellent read!,"This was a recommendation on Amazon's vacation reading by topics. Took this book with me to Maui and I could not put it down. It is well written and very suspenseful. The metamorphosis of the lead character, Richard, is intriguing and ropes you in. A fantastic read from a terrific writer. I can't wait for his next book."
4,A fine novel,"This is a terrific book.The constant labeling as a ""Generation X"" or ""twenty-something"" novel does it a real disservice. I enjoyed it a lot and am not of that age group - or supposed mind set. You don't have to be a 1920's flapper to appreciate ""The Great Gatsby"" or a 1950s beat to appreciate ""On The Road"" , so don't worry about labels and enjoy this thought provoking book."
3,The lights are on--brightly--but no one's home,"It's gripping, it's a page-turner, the locale is exotic and intriguing, but The Beach is also obviously the work of a young writer just finding his way with dialogue and character development (the endless puffing on cigarettes is a dead giveaway). And what were they attacking the narrator with at the end? Shrimp cocktail forks? I don't think the book warrants the lavish critical praise it's received, but a writer with such a gift for narrative drive bears watching."
3,Paradise is not all it's cracked up to be !,"This enjoyable novel follows a young English traveler, Richard, as he seeks a rumored paradise away from the throngs of tourists. The personal interactions and Richard's slow descent into emotional instability make a great counterpart to the beautifully described island. Missing the romantic elements of the movie based on this book, it still managed to keep this reader interested to the end. Though there are elements of this book that lack punch, and the end was anticlimactic, this is an author I will look for in the future and a read I recommend."
1,The Beach: Bogged down and boring,"Having read shining reviews for The Beach and expecting it to be a next-generation Lord of the Flies, I was disappointed to find that the novel fell far short. The author spends 350 pages providing a mundane travelogue and spinning out pointless dialogue that leaves the character development weak, at best. I plodded through the book, though, expecting a well-crafted, thoughtful climax but was disgusted to find the trashy, pointless waste of words that were the last 50 pages of the novel. Don't waste your time with this one. It is highly overrated."
1,"I hated ""The Beach""","Having been encouraged by all the hype to read ""The Beach"", I was really disappointed. The book read like the first draft of a manuscript that the author should have been told to take away and revise, edit and rewrite until he had a proper novel, but publishers these days don't seem to have the staff. In any case, why bother when it sells like hot cakes?If Alex Garland was seeking to employ the most self-absorbed narrator in all recent fiction, he succeeded, but the result is that the events of the plot come out of nowhere. Since the protagonist is so uninvolved and unaware of the motivations of those around him, it is impossible for the reader to engage with him or them. There is no development; things just happen, and the narrator is unaffected by them.All I can say is that the blank canvas of Leonardo DiCaprio is probably an apt choice to play the lead role in the film of the book."
1,LAUGHABLY BAD,"This is the worst book I've read in a long time. What makes it so awful is the kind of bad writing John Gardner refers to in the Art of Fiction, wherein the author undermines any empathy the reader might have with a character or situation by making gross comparisons or connections. Gardner's example is a writer describing his red-faced, weeping father as looking like a baby trying to squeeze out a dump. Though I don't have an example from Garland -- I couldn't get rid of the book fast enough -- believe me, it's full of them. The whole book, in fact, is nothing but a series of ridiculously inappropriate and wholly incredible reactions -- e.g., the narrator risks his life to get away from dope farmers, then returns to taunt them. I might be able to stomach this book better if there were a little irony in it. But it's just dumb, dumb, dumb."
3,"Good start, boring finish","Bought this on biz trip to London. Loved the concept and openng scenes. then it spiraled into cliche. action was not very believable. stick with lord of the flies, not this backpacker nostalgia"
3,Have I read this novel before?,"Throughout reading The Beach I felt a sense of deja vu. Perhaps Lord of the Flies; Perhaps Heart of Darkness ( The Horror! the Horror!) I think we have a copycat on our hands! Despite a unique situation and setting, this modern day paradise seemed also unoriginal and bland. The ending was unreal and although I gave this novel a 3. The 3 came from my like of the characters."
5,Perfection,Alex Garland's The Beach is one of the best books I have ever read. He hooks you from the very start with intriguing descriptions and thought processes. Garland's style is original and never drifts towards the cheesy or bland. His insight into the psychology of smaller groups is so alarmingly acurate that one has to wonder if the story was at one time a reality. One would be hard pressed to find another author of Garland's caliber who also has Garland's respect for the assumed intelligence of his audience.
3,over rated!,"contrite topic that's been written about a thousand times... Lord of The Flies, Rushing TO Paradise, Eco's The Island of The Day Before, Films-with Anne Heche and Harrison Ford, Return to paradise... someone winds up in se asia or an island things go wrong then they discover themselves, whatever... this is a good book for armchair adventurers and wannabe backpackers... much better adventure travel reading like Redmond O'hanlon and Tim Cahill... a big fan of Thailand in general his descriptions of Bangkok and the islands are great, and he does have a pleasant voice... I would say see the movie but Leo depresses me, so you might as well read the book..."
3,Phat book for the millenium.,"Generation X takes Eden by storm. Forming a community with what little the island gave them. Beautiful sunsets, massive amount of marijuana, freindships - relationships and tragedy all in one. It is also compulsive and clever for the young adults of the world."
1,what a waste of money,"Don't get anything from Cowon...it's a waste of money. This Mp3 palayers don't work as advertised, you don't get any technical support at all (they don't even have a phone #) and if you have a Mac forget about upgrading a firmware. You need a PC anyway, but of course they won't tell you that. Instead they say ""Mac compatible""....My first unit wasn't working after 1 week and they wanted to replace it with a REFURBISHED one.....I had to fight to get a new one.Stay away from them, for the same price you better get an I-pod or something like that...."
5,Amazing Sound,"It's incredible how much sound can come from that tiny little thing. Many sound enhancements including 5 band eq. with presets (each one of them you can modify). VERY long battery life, great for traveling (replaceable battery). VERY GOOD construcción, even the little buttom on the carry on case has the company name on it. Lots of features, too many to describe. Very small size. User friendly. GREAT BUY. GREAT SOUND. Just be sure to get some other headphones, like sennheiser hp 497, px100, or Grado's SR60."
4,Excellent personal narratives--4 stars overall,"The history of Gallipoli, the Mesopotamian Front and the Palestine front are complex subjects, but to discuss all three in 324 pages does not do each justice. That being said, Lord Carver has written an average history of each campaign. But what is noteworthy for the historian is the incorporation of personal narratives found by Lord Carver, and woven throughout the book.My interest in this book was solely in the Mesopotamian portion of this book. However, I did read the entire book, because I found that the stories were extraordinary glimpses into these actions. It is one thing to read history, it is another to read eyewitness accounts of the actions. The book is a bit on the pricey side, but for anyone interested in the Turkish front, this should be a must for your collection"
3,Stuck halfways...,"This is book is mainly concerned with the theory of electronics, and presents it without getting bogged down in advanced math. However, it does not really explain things - most of it reads like a summary of a more detailed book or an article from an encyclopedia - very dry. Also, I found it rather brief on the practical aspects - here, you will not learn how to read schematics, understand why components are where they are, and take educated guess at how to adapt a circuit for your needs.In this sense, it is not a practical beginners' book. In my opinion, if you are serious about theory, this is not the book for you, and if you want to do practical projects, you will not find anything here."
1,no good,"waste of money, big time.dont believe the above review - hundreds of better cds to spend your hard earned cash on. this one stinks. i just flushed ""my money"" down the toilet."
2,Volume Problems,"We thought this was a great idea but we found that it's impossible to get the volume down low enough. The volume on our I-pod is down nearly all the way, and still the music blasts out of the speakers. We have to use it on the far side of the room, or cover it with a heavy blanket to keep the sound down."
3,inferior sound quality,"This is a cool idea and product, but the sound quality is poor. We returned ours."
3,It smells funny,"My daughter have been exclusively breastfed so she refuses to take any bottles/cups. I decided to try this straw cup based on the reviews, but she rejects it just like she does with other cups. I also noticed that this cup somehow has a funny smell to it, someting like mint, so the water tastes funny too when using the cup. Now I have to keep looking for other cups.Update 2/29/08: I finally found the perfect cup that my daughter is willing to take. It is Nuby No-spill Gripper Cup for less than $3. It has soft spout for babies' tender gums, built-in vavle for easy cleaning, special design allows babies to control the flow rate, very easy to suck from, light and easy for babies' small hands to hold, no leak, no spill, safe to throw around, a great great transition cup for breastfed babies. It is the only cup my baby ever took!"
4,Peter finally gets to sing :),"Hi-- this is a wonderful, easy listening CD. It's great to pep you up, relax or just be. I especially like Peter's version of ""One Trick Pony,"" and ""Hi Babe."" I am so glad to hear his voice so clearly and fluently. He shines as the talented folk singer he is. :)His harmony with James Lee Stanley is perfect. :)Dana"
2,Does Not Perform As Advertised,"I upgraded from Wordperfect Office 12 to X3, but have returned the upgrade to Wordperfect. The much touted ability to import PDF files is so poorly implemented that it is all but unusable. In addition, the Wordperfect Mail component will not load data files while my antivirus (ZoneAlarm) is running in the background. Corel Technical Support takes no responsibility for the incompatability. Do not upgrade unless these issues are addressed."
3,Watch out for OEM versions,"Be sure to check out your purchase. OEM versions do not have certain features that the full versions do, such as QuickFinder, manuals, customer support and cannot be used as an upgrade. So when you are reading all the wonderful stuff on this page be sure it applies to your specific purchase."
1,Quattro does not work as advertised,"The claims of smooth integration with Excel are inflated. The first Excel file I attempted to open caused Quattro to crash. Rebooted and tried again, same result. Tried to open a tab-delimited text file, crashed Quattro as well.Tried to run quattro in both Excel mode and normal quattro mode, didn't make a difference, the excel file crashed quattro in either case. There was nothing special about the excel file (no VBA code, no formulas, etc.). It was a basic file with inventory data (name, quantity, SKU, etc.)I have not been able to open a single non-Quattro document in Quattro. Don't waste your money if you are looking to use this with Excel files, CSV or text documents.Online help isn't helpful. They don't seem to acknowledge the problem online (would clearly hinder efforts to sell if this appeared on their support site). So you are left to relying on their tech support which I have not been able to get a response from."
3,Gossip girl,Arrived within the correct time and its a great season! Disk 4 in the set jumps during episodes which is so annoying!!!!!
1,"Dear Amazon, Whats With the Poor Quality?","I purchased this on Amazon rather than iTunes to save $1 per episode ($1.99 on Amazon as compared to $2.99 on iTunes). It doesn't download to your computer and I am forced to watch it on amazon.com...Which would be fine if it weren't for the awful quality? If I wasn't concerned with quality, I would have watched it on one of those illegitimate pirating websites. I expected high quality from Amazon! Where do they get off charging $1.99 to stream this low-quality fuzzy blur? Awful. I'm calling customer service tomorrow to get a refund and going to buy it on itunes right now. Never again purchasing video from Amazon I'd rather pay the extra $1 per episode. (And no its not my computer or internet access, I have excellent quality in both)."
5,Great,Easy to use and easy to watch. I like to be able to catch episodes whenever i want. I will order again.
1,Worst Season so Far,"Unless you love storylines about guest stars, this season of GG is not for you. It's also not a good season for any couple or character as far as development goes. The writing is plot driven and there's no continuity from episode to episode. Basically, skip it."
4,do you really want to make vegan desserts?,"If you really want to make vegan desserts at home, this is a good reference. However, be prepared to shop for hard-to-find, expensive ingredients like arrowroot, kuzu, and agar. Also, I wish the author included approximate times for each recipe, like some of my other cookbooks do. I made the tofu frosting, and even though it was good, it wasn't good enough to justify the two hours it took to make. I think this book is good enough to give it four stars, but I've discovered that, personally, I'd rather just go to a vegan bakery than bother doing it myself."
3,Octinomos - Fast BM,"Octinomos is on Baphomet records and they hail from Sweden, they play totally fast violent black metal, in the vein of Marduck. There really isn't much diversity in the songs, this whole album is usually running at 666 mph. This can get really boring really fast. The vocals are in the more high pitched department, they don't sound grim at all, the drums are constantly blasting, and are usually in the same pattern. The 1st song is my personal fave, and has some killer riffs. Hmmm.. what else is their to say about this.. Nothing really, if you dig the hyper fast swedish sounding BM then you will love this. This album just doesn't do much for me, unfortunately. It isn't a bad album, but I was just expecting more. Anyway.. I really recommend Axis of Advance from Canada!"
5,great book about the company covering many items of history,this book covers the making of statues of great war heros of the past to truck anr car parts. manufacturing of boat and boat trailers. it is amazing the amount of interesting questions i was asked about my all steel mullins trailer at the yuma az. car show this past weekend. the trailers are so popular they are reproducing them in fiberglass now. i have loaned my book out due to so many people cant believe one company had theit hands into everything.
1,waste of money!!!!!!,"I had the Honeywell uv lamp installed in my home for $589!!! within 2 months it blow a bulb I replaced it(and the bulbs are Expensive!) and one month later it blew another bulb The installer checked it and found nothing wrong with the install(which is basic,cut a hole in the duct and plug it in) so I contacted Honeywell and they were a waste of time They had excuse after excuse, blaming everyone, installer , me etc... Dont waste your money even when it was on it seemed to do NOTHING Read the goverment reports there is NO proof that it does anything unless you put a professional, real professional (thousands of dollars) This is my opinion from my time of using it but now its just an expensive plug to cover the hole in the duct!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Honeywell RUVLAMP/1C UV Air Treatment System,"Honeywell RUVLAMP1/C UV Air Treatment SystemI recently purchased and installed this unit in the return side of my HVAC system. It comes well packaged and secure. The instructions are very clear and very specific about the dangers of looking at the UV light when it's operating (DON'T DO IT!). A 2"" metal cutting hole saw and a 3/32"" drill bit are the only tools required. It comes with an installation template marking the center of the 2"" hole and the 3/32"" holes. Installation is a snap. It also includes several warning labels (self adhesive) to apply below the unit and 2 other locations to alert service personnel about it. I highly recommend this unit. I'll update this in a few months after it's been running for awhile."
2,unacceptable wait,The order was placed 5/1........Just got a postcard (5/28) stating the start of the subscription is delayed and the first issue will arrive in 10-12 weeks............order date 5/1.....receive first issue around September 1....unacceptable!
2,ADS ADS ADS,Lots of sex/tobacco/inappropriate ads. Seems like there are far more ads than articles. Definitely canceling my subscription.
3,Popular Science Magazine ( present ),"The past year's magazine seems rather light on content/depth in its articles, as compared to the same magazine 10-15 year's ago."
5,Popular Science Mag,"This magazine I have been wanting for a long time. It is simple , fun and so interesting to read. Enjoyable and informative for even the youngest future scientist or not. Also could not beat the price for what Amazon had listed."
1,Magazine has not been delivered,"Ordered Popular Science on June 27. I received this request to review the transaction today, but the magazine has not been delivered. I'd actually forgotten about it . . . now I'll have to see what's going on."
2,still waiting,So far I recieved two of the same mag's in two month's time. I am waiting if I will get the exact same one for a third month.....
3,Out of date issues,"Popular Science, one of many that does this. After about 2-3 weeks after you order it, you will receive 3 different copies of Popular Science. One that is current (selling in book stores) and the 2 month before that one.Let's say your first copy comes May 25, you will get July, June, and May. Most all magazines ship new ones 45 days before the month comes.So your 12 issue order is only 10. Ok if you don't like old news and don't mind getting ripped off.If you call them, they might change the exp. date. They did for me.Over all I like Popular Science."
2,Delay?!,I have not received a single issue however I did get a card from PS saying that the delivery would begin later (more than 6 weeks) than advertised because of demand.
1,Where is it?,I'm sure it's a great magazine! If I ever get one I'll let you know what I think of it. I ordered it in March and my grandson still hasn't recieved one.
3,Constant billing at higher rate after payment,"After payment by Amazon, Popular Science has billed me three times at a higher rate.I will not renew, I would like to cancel.The magazine is fine, the billing is offensive, and incompetent."
4,Short and Sweet,"If your into science and tech news this is a must have magazine. It's packed full of interesting information and light on ads; but as a whole it is quite short, coming in around 50 pages or so. The writing of the editors seems to be pretty well done, it's informative with an occasional witty quip."
5,Husband Loves It,My husband subscribes to this magazine and reads it from cover to cover. He loves all the articles on the latest developments in science and technology. Highly recommended.
1,have not received anything,"this is the second magazine subscription i have signed up for in the past two years, and have not received one of them???please help out, my bank account was charged, please send my subscription."
1,you guys are kidding right?,"how can you ask me to rate a product that I haven't received yet? by the way, when will I receive my first issue? I will revisit this rating after I get my first issue. it's only been two months so far."
1,"Should be Titled ""Populist Science""","I too am disappointed with this magazine.Currently subscribed for two years now, and for many more years when I was younger, and found it very enjoyable reading back then, but today, I find a Liberal, Left-Wing Agenda of the completely defraduded Global Warming & Climate Change issue. It is constantly presented, and the many articles are geared towards convicing you of this populist agenda.That is not what I want from this type of magazine and I will not renew my subscription.I may try another, or just forego any more of these rags, which is disappointing to me.Many others must feel the same, as they are giving the magazine away at $5.00 for 12 issues! That tells me that their core readers are falling off a cliff, and they are scrambling to find new subscribers."
1,UNHAPPY,How can you send me a review on a product that I ordered on October 22 of 2006 and have not so recieved it. I can not believe you are still in business selling magizines at this rate.
1,Stay away from this product-Company no longer sell or services this crib light.,"Recieved this item as a gift, worked great for about a week. Out of the blue it just stopped working. Switched to new batteries and reset the device. Nada.Amazon was swift with sending a replacement, however it was dead right out of the box. When I called customer support they stated they no longer service or sell the crib light and that I needed to return it back to Amazon because ""They take returns on everything"". So much for this crib light and Munchkins customer support."
2,Battery eater,"I received this as a gift when our daughter was about a month old. We have hardly used it, but it has still drained through 2 sets of batteries (4 AA) very quickly. It did turn on when she cried, but was too quiet to actually soothe her. There is no volume adjustment, and the only sounds it makes are the 'womb' sounds. I think the changing color lights are neat to watch, but unfortunately they haven't really captured our baby's attention. Since it drains batteries so quickly, we likely won't be using it much except to watch the colored lights occasionally for entertainment."
2,Not at the price,"This book is NOT for the lay reader. You must have a grounding in statistical analysis to appreciate the research articles. Nonstatistical articles include a nice one on forensic archaelogy, three on ethics and two on cybercrime that essentially say there is a hacker subculture out there. The book has only one article with Godwin's four way classification scheme. A person who wants to learn that would be better off buying his other book (which I have not read). This book is a textbook and I've had much better textbooks. FYI Although I have taken many of the Justice and Paralegal courses at the University of Alaska, Anchorage, I have no background in law enforcement whatsoever."
3,Primarily a book of advocacy,"While the book purports to give the reader information on implementing web standards, there actually isn't a lot of meaty code examples. The examples are too shallow with insufficent discussion. Mr. Zeldman, however, is very good at advocating why designers and businesses should support web standards. There is quite a bit of advocacy in this book. If you take out the code examples, it becomes a very good ""high-level"" web standards advocacy book for neophyte web designers, technical managers, and business clients to read. As the book is currently packaged, though, I feel the book does not do what it advertised.If you're looking for meaty discussion of techniques for coding web standardized markup, you will definitely want ""Web Standards Solutions: The Markup and Style Handbook"" or ""Bulletproof Web Design"" by Dan Cederholm."
3,"Authoritative, tongue-in-cheek, wordy","Jeffrey Zeldman is an authority on the topic. You should read this if you develop Web sites...but be prepared for a Frodo-like journey through Middle Earth to find the tokens of wisdom in Zeldman's circular, cliché-per-minute writing style.Don't get me wrong, it's better than boring, but it could have used a wave of the wand by a concise-thinking (redundancy-slashing) editor. After reading the book, you'll know your stuff, understand the history, and be prepared for productive future-minded, accessible, and tidy XHTML coding."
3,Bad experience with this knife,"I got the knife for Christmas 2005. It is of a high quality, and I was very excited to receive it. I put it on my keychain and have used it since. Unfortunately, the USB stick stopped working the second time I tried to use it. I sent it back to Victorinox (just the USB stick), and never heard back from them. It's been four months and I called them but they don't acknowledge receiving my USB stick.So I've got a nice knife now, but no USB capability. I am utterly frustrated with the terrible customer service (I call them and call them but they never give a straight answer).The light is not very bright.. I can barely use it to find the key hole on my door when I'm coming home at night. So it's not really useful to illuminate anything significant.The knife and scissors have served me well. The file is not really great compared to other files. I wish this had a ruler like other knifes (it would be easy to etch a scale on one of the tools)."
2,Watchout!,"Only buy this with a good in-store replacement warranty (which bumps up an expensive device to an unreasonable amount, BTW).If the USB memory module is placed in a USB port and pulled out too soon, you could permanently corrupt the drive.Swissbit will RMA the drive for twice what 512 MB versions are currently going for! That's not a warranty!"
2,Poor quality,"For the price, I guess this smoker is good. However, the paint on the side firebox crackled and started falling off the first time I used it. Since I don't need the paint to be there to cook, I give it two stars but this will certainly cut down on the life of it. It also needs better support on the bottom of the firebox next to the grill. Overall I can cook with this but if you make a firebox for a grill, you would think you'd choose a paint that didn't crack and start peeling off the first time someone used it."
4,Hubby is in Heaven!,"My hubby got a great deal on the grill at a local grocery store and has ALWAYS wanted a legitimate smoker. I found this one and had some AMEX points which made it nearly 50% off! He's used it every weekend since and loves it. It makes him happy. He said it was easy to install but sits a little crooked. This hasn't affected it's usefulness. I would've given it a 5 star rating but the first time he used it, the paint bubbled off! I understand this means the fire was too hot but my thought is, ""It's a grill/smoker!"" He touched it up with spray paint and it's good as new. We love this grill/smoker combo!"
3,Charming story but dwells heavily on infertility theme,"Beautifully illustrated! Dan Davis has penned a truly charming story for children in The Blacksmith's Gift, but has failed to divorce it from the central theme of his previous work, ""Infertility's Anguish"". Heavy emphasis on the main character's obsession with his own lack of children bogs down the beginning of this otherwise engaging tale and may turn off readers before they get to the heartwarming story that follows. Parents and young children may not relate to a character who laments his empty nest obsessively to the point of financial ruin, so I strongly recommend that parents preview this book before reading it to their children and consider whether or not the themes presented in the early pages are suitable for them. They may wish to skip some of the introductory material and begin reading in the middle."
5,You must read this book!,"In the Reasonable Faith, Dr. Craig has provided us with an impressive, up-to-date and scholary treatment of Christian apologetics to equip true believers in proclamation of the Gospel. His work is careful, acurate and fair.It clarifies many different issues from a biblical point of view. You must read that book."
4,fantastic read so far,"I've been enjoying this read from the beginning. I must admit two things however, it is my first read into this field specifically and I am only half way through the book. As such my review can only be partial and perhaps on completion my rating should be amended.Aside from the above the arguments put forward in this book so far are coherent and exciting. I would recommend this to anyone who is interested in theism and learning more about why one can logically hold to this view. It gives great insight into how one might articulate such reasons in conversation and I have been encouraged deeply in my faith as a result.William Lane Craig is a respectful and deep thinking Christian. He easily articulates difficult topics and shows an honorable respect for those that would discourage him which for me are telling insights into his worldview and the faith that he holds to. I feel refreshed with every new page read and will be taking away more than just good arguments from this book."
4,Intellectual Reasons for Faith,"This is not an easy book to read. There are some very intellectual arguments that need time to study with effort to truly comprehend. This is another fine resource, though, for those who are willing to boldly proclaim the truth to an unbelieving world. Worth the effort."
1,Theological Onanism from a Hack,"Personally, I find it insulting to see apologetics reduced to the bland rice mash this man feeds to the readers. The complete disconnect from reality is pathetic to see in an adult, as he waxes eloquently, yet incoherently, on what he wishes were true instead of what can be revealed through actual scholarship."
1,Does not have the 4 studded mounting bolts,"This product does not have the 4 studded bolts, which are essential for installation. The old ones cannot be extracted."
5,very cute,"very cute, it was exactly what we wanted to complete the decorating for our daughter's room."
4,Not bad for the price,"The battery drains pretty fast, but these are still expensive compared to the major brand ones. Not bad for the price. I will defintely repurchase, esp with the free shipping option."
3,Davies in Vaudeville,"This was originally released in '72 as a double-LP, one disc featuring new studio material and the other a live set from a two-night Carnegie Hall stand. It's a vaudevillian music hall mish-mash of variable attraction, but also features sublime tunes such as ""Celluloid Heroes"" and ""Sitting In My Hotel"". The overriding vibe seems to be one of either blissful or resigned insobriety, but still highlights frontman Ray Davies' unique and compelling stage persona."
2,"Isabella Alden, Christian?","This seems to be a pathetic attempt at Anti-Mormon Literature, made worse as it is from a popular Christian writer who gave only one case and only one side of that case. To have re-printed it without an explaination of the true history of Polygamy is to hit the LDS Church again. Most reading this book will have never met a 'Mormon' and this will be all the exposure they get. Is that a Christian way of doing things. By the way, the LDS Church is the 5th largest religion in the USA and most of its members live outside of the USA. Very poor writing and re-printing. If you write anti-Mormon lit. at least be up front about it."
2,Not very good on Kindle,This book is difficult to navigate on a Kindle. Only around 175 restaurants and just about every town that I look up- does not have a restaurant reviewed. As an example seems strange that several restaurants are listed for Key West but few other places in Florida. Wasted Money.
2,Predictable and full of inconsistencies,"I usually like Ms. Garwood's historical romances, but this one left me disappointed. Too many inconsistencies in the story, and the main characters frequently behaving in a manner that has nothing to do with the time in which the book is set. If you haven't read Julie Garwood before, I would suggest you not start with this. ""Saving Grace"", ""The Bride"", ""The Secret"" and others are much better examples of her writing."
1,JULIE GARWOOD,I AM BAFFLED BY JULIE GARWOOD. SOME OF HER BOOKS ARE AMONG MY ALL TIME FAVORITES (SUCH AS THE LYON'S LADY) AND SOME OF HER BOOKS I ABSOLUTELY HATE LIKE GENTLE WARRIOR AND THIS ONE.
4,"Entertaining, love the challege between the two of them!","I read the book in one sitting. I have read most of Ms. Garwood and found them all very entertaining. Although most of the romance novels depict two people with opposit personally, it is refreshing to read a novel that the two characters can chanllenge each other in most ways. Caroline and Jered had more in common than other heros and heroines. I would have love more of a plot twist from the event Caroline witness when she was young. The prologue was very dramatic and the story did not seem to explain the subsequent events sufficiently. Caroline's relationships wither her cousins are endearing and full of personalities. Although Jered is somewhat egotistical, who can blame him for his status during that period of history?"
3,Rebellious Desire had no rebellion whatsoever!!,"The Duke of Bradford desired Caroline (a mere Colonial from Massachusetts) more than any other woman in England. (If you can believe that). Caroline wasn't really rebellious to anyone and had no reason to be so. Well, if you call not wanting to marry Bradford rebellious, then I guess the title qualifies.There was no great mystery to keep you spellbound except the fact that someone wanted Caroline dead. Bradford's jealous behavior and Caroline's desire for his ultimate trust became boring.In other words, the book was a decent read but had no plot of characters that kept me spellbound. But I'm going to offend many readers and say that very few of Garwood's books encourage me to keep turning the page.But alas I give Rebellious Desire three stars for those readers not desiring adventure, action, mysteries, or comedy."
3,What a block-head!,"This is the most stubborn hero I've ever read in a romance, and that's saying a lot! It takes him AGES to finally realize he loves the heroine! She is spirited in the beginning, but as soon as they get married she turns into a wimp! The story is O.K., but not up to Garwood's usual standards."
3,Not so much,"I thought I would like this album based on the song samples, but I'm not loving it when I hear the whole songs. Seems like one of the singers is sometimes slightly off key."
4,Haunting Account of Murder,"This book captures your attention from the start. It goes into detail on the characters involved and you learn their mental states early on. I would have given it 5 stars except that I don't care for the in-depth background on the detectives that is given - some may find this enhances the story, but I could do without it."
1,Cute premise--sloppy editing,"I was planning to purchase this book for my first-grade son. He loves castles, cathedrals, and everything to do with the Middle Ages. But once I looked inside the book on Amazon's website, I decided against the book--because the editor didn't catch the misuse of a pronoun in the preview pages. I expect the books my children read to be not only enjoyable but also to demonstrate the correct use of the English language. If the preview pages aren't written correctly, what other errors will I cringe about in the rest of the book?I never write reviews but feel that books for our children must be held to the highest standards."
3,Cool book! Fun read with a bittersweet ending,"This book is interesting in that it is told from a straight man's point of view .... for a while. Both exciting and engaging, The Chimney Sweeper is a murder mystery that revels in its reverse format. It's not the greatest book you'll ever read, but it is really a fabulously enjoyable one."
4,Does what it says on the tin,"Its funky!Although the cover would lead you to believe this is a bona fida Dr John album, in fact its not. Orginally it was released as The Donald Harrison Band with Dr John. Makes no difference though its still great.Tracks 2 to 8 were recorded live at Birdland in 1991 and most of the time the music reeks of New Orleans, but just occasionally some great straight ahead Jazz playing slips in (not surprising as they were playing at Birdland) such as a minute into Iko Iko when Harrison takes a great Jazz Alto Sax solo and there follows a Piano solo that clearly isn't Dr Johns. On Mamzelle Zizi Harrison goes into a Coltrane like solo over a modal vamp. So its a very interesting mix!Its all great stuff and you'll love this if like Dr John and theres plenty of great Alto playing to justify buying this if you're a Jazz nut."
2,Disjoint,"This book is crammed with information on ""everything""but it's disjoint. It needs a serious edit and I would notrecommend it. I'd compare this work with Wall and his PERL books. The exception being that Mike isn't obnoxious ortrying to convince us that he's so smart."
3,It does the job,"This is exactly what the price states, an affordable solder sucker. Don't expect it to last too long for you. It does work and gets the job done but it is not of great quality. If you want something that you can put in your tool kit and last I would spend a few more bucks on quality. All I needed it for was to fix my girlfriends laptop and it did but I wouldn't bet on it lasting for much longer. Short term it is good but I like quality which is why I knocked it down to 3 stars."
2,"The best word to describe this product: ""Lame""","I bought this as an advertized package with Elenco AmeriKit Learn to Solder Kit. I saw a review on there talking about how they wished it had a ""Desoldering pump"" My solder-friendly friends told me they had never heard of a ""Desoldering Pump"". This is likely why-a product this poor is not worth notoriety. The pump is incredibly weak, and works about 1 in 10 attempts. The only way to get enough suction to pick up the melted solder was to hit the release button, which would then kick-back, suck up some of the solder, and then smush the rest onto the pad. I recommend just using the sponge supplied in the learn to solder kit."
1,"Barely adequate, and then it broke. Garbage.","Agree with other reviewers that this product is cheaply made. The recoil is a bit much, it was definitely hard to use it with any precision. The suction is just barely adequate for cleaning small solder joints, but the plastic tip is so large it's hard to get it right on a small joint.So, this was mediocre in the first place.. and then it broke. Pulled the trigger and got a wimpy result, then pushed the plunger back in and it's never coming out. Probably a total of 30 cycles before it broke.I suppose I should have known better and bought an actual tool in the first place instead of this toy."
3,"Flimsy, but it works.",If you need a cheap home use solder remover you have found it.An ultra thin casing and plastic nozzle. I wouldn't use it for heavy duty or a lot of any duty.
2,Check it out of the library instead,"I only bought this cos my little one was going through a Cookie Monster phase, but it truly was a waste of money...there's not much in this book...and for the price, its better to get it from the library instead."
2,The Secrets of a Fire King,"I loved Kim Edwards novel, ""Memory Makers Daughter"" so I decided to try a book of her short stories. I am not as impressed by this book of short stories as I was the novel that she wrote."
3,"Baby loves it, but not durable","Our son loves these toys, but they aren't very durable. Since it was a 2 pack we kept one of the toys in a drawer and used the other one. The one we were using actually broke because the spring that connects the ""bobber"" to the rest of the toy rusted through! I can't believe they used a material that would rust in a bath toy -- especially one designed in such a way that you can't really dry it off completely between uses. We just started using the one that was in the drawer. I wonder if it'll last longer.Pros:- bubbles and dripping water are interesting to baby- ""petals"" around the perimeter are ""chewy""Cons:- metal spring rusts after a couple of months of use- clear dome appears to be polycarbonate, so I'm a bit concerned that it may contain BPA"
5,Very durable!,"I've had this cover for over a year now and other than fading from the sun, it has held up pretty damn well. It fits my grill perfect and only takes seconds to slap it on. I'm extremely happy with the cover especially after reading some of the negative reviews."
4,Good Stuff!,"This is a quality-made product of heavy duty material. It fits like a glove over the smoke stack on top. I did not purchase the optional side fire box on the right side. The drawback to this is the fact that the cover was designed to cover this also, resulting in the wheels running over the excess material and stopping suddenly. You must be careful when moving the grill."
4,Nice Story,"I loved the story and all of the characters. The only thing I didn't like about it was that it had a weird ending... ""Then ran back towards m Aunt's house"". I just don't get that."
2,It was a disapointment,"I was quite disapointed in this book. I KNOW he is trying to lower fat, but I was expecting to find recipes that would please the whole family, and instead found things like stuffed chicken with peach pican stuffing. Many of the recipes are just too fancy for my ""meat and potatoes"" spouse!"
1,Useless,To add to the other review about how terrible this product is...It would seem obvious that you would wipe a rectal thermometer off after use with alcohol right? The alcohol ate into the readout screen and I can't see through it any more.I'm on the hunt for a new one.
2,Reflections on geotechnical practice,"This is a descriptive expose of personal experiences in geotechnical practice. There are some interesting ""case studies"" presented to illustrate points. But much of the rambling is about conflicts between engineers trained in specialties other than soil mechanics and their lack of comprehension concerning geotechnical principles. The book would be better titled conflicts in engineering practice. The author uses the problems that are created by bad engineering practice to explain by example what to watch for when responsible to over seeing construction practice. It is a book about construction practice more than design analysis. Though the book is titled Construction of Fills, 50 plus pages of the 253 text pages is devoted to construction of septic systems. If you like to read war stories this is your book."
1,I can't believe I bought or watched this movie!,"I can't believe I was stupid enough to buy or watch this movie. I kept thinking this movie is going to get better, but never did. Don't waste your time with this Hollywood version of the Iraq War."
1,Poor story,"This is a very poorly written story, the creators only got an oscar because it was a current war film. very far from plausible."
2,Real Soldiers,"They should have interviewed real soldiers. The campaign ad wizards made sure to add in their biased reviews ""a non-political"" depiction .........I recommend ""Orientalism as a Tool for Colonialism"", or any book by Norman Finkelstein, Noam Chomsky...etc."
5,A Masterpeice!,One of the best war movies I've seen.Entertaining from start to finish.This movie will have you at the edge of your seat.Gripping and some intense moments.Jeremey Renner does an outstanding job.I can't believe the low rating on this film.It's a masterpeice.I rarely ever give a movie 5 stars and especially not a war movie but this movie captivated me.Give it a chance.You might just be blown away by this movie too!
3,No Closed Captions,"The problem with renting your movies is that it does not permit closed captions and therefore I could not fully enjoy it,"
5,The Hurt Locker,Great movie about one of the jobs that have to be done in war times that nobody wants to do. It takes an almost genuis/warped individual to look at it a different way to keep himself going. Very intense just try taking a breath.You can see why it won best picture and best director.
4,Hurt Locker,This movie was not what I actually expected but I thoroughly enjoyed it. I found myself getting wrapped up with the characters. The movie is about a team of guys who disarm bombs in the midst of war in the middle east and how they each cope with the intense pressure of their day-to-day job. Highly recommend this movie.The Hurt Locker
1,Hurt is right !,I was hurt just watching this movie I been to few military funerals and I hope I do not have to go for long time. I only watch 10 Min's of this movie and like I said it was to painful for me to continue. Why ? because having family and friends in the military and knowing that 9 young men who served in Iraq are buried near my father's grave who served in WWII made me very sadd and also greatful that we have freedoms today because of their service to us.
1,Garbage,"What a load of crap! This is the biggest waste of time I have sat through in a long time. Unrealistic, poor story line, shallow characters and the most annoying camera work you can imagine. I don't understand the recent surge in the directors looking for a shakey look in the way they shoot films. It does nothing but make me dizzy and leave me feeling ill.This movie is not worth the plastic its embedded in."
5,9 TIMES!!!!,"I LOVED THIS MOVIE, I WATCHED IT NINE TIMES! I WAS ALL LIKE, EIGHT TIMES WILL NEVER BE ENOUGH FOR THIS MOVIE!"
3,"Meh, Dissapointed","I was expecting a great movie after this won a bunch of Oscars as when I've watched most of the previous best movie winners it's usually amazing. This movie was average, some interesting moments but still not something you will look back on as amazing. There where plenty of better pictures up for the award that deserved it but looks like it was a political decision to give the finger to Cameron. You want to see an amazing movie that was up for the award see Precious."
3,"Great action, but with a bomb crater where its heart should be","2009's Oscar winner for Best Picture was a bit of a bust. The film follows the work of a bomb-disposal unit in Iraq. There's plenty of boom-boom, and the film provides a sense of Iraq that is dreary, desolate and dangerous. But like many recent war movies -- ""Jar Heads"" being one -- it fails to deliver on the inner lives of its characters. We see comrades fighting brutally among themselves and taking insane risks, but get no insight into what drives them. Even the ""hurt locker"" of the title barely gets its due. Some might call this respecting the audience's intelligence, but I call it lazy and shallow.At the end of the day, the film has little to say about Iraq, and less to say about modern warfare or the life of a soldier. Other than ""war is fun for some people."""
1,Horrible! I'd rather poke myself in the eye with a pencil,This movie is boring. I love war movies but I could not wait for this movie to end. Don't waste your time with this one!
1,DON'T BOTHER,"This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen.....HOW did this win best picture???No set up of characters, no plot, and no ending.....it's just a documentary on bomb disposal and a boring one at that!"
1,"Dull, predictable, shallow characters, no drama, no story","Not once did I become emotionally invested in the characters in this movie. There is no exposition of the characters, no development of a story line. I think you would find more drama and interest in a well done news piece on the war. The characters are poorly written, we know nothing about them, they are just ""soldiers"". I can appreciate the attempt at detail for a soldier's life in Iraq but for a movie to succeed, it still needs a story and interesting characters. We never get a sense or where they are, what city, or anything about the local population. The movie is shot ""hand held"" style with fast ""news footage"" like zooms and shots and this tend to keep the viewing oscillating between feeling its a documentary versus a dramatic presentation.People die /explode on cue right when you expect them to, not because of the story, not because of random chance, but to simply shock the audience and make you go ""oh""."
2,Too Much Motion,"I guess they did a good job of depicting a true to life war atmosphere but 1/2 way through the movie I started feeling nauseated with a bad headache and had to go lay down, I just had to get away from all the noise & motion. The close-up scenes and constant camera motion was just too much for me, and I'm an avid gore/horror buff plus I've enjoyed many war movies. I was disappointed in this one after all the hype."
4,A winner.,"Pam and I both like this one. It very relivent to today's wars. As a Vietnamvet, I can relate to those who war becomes a drug.MLN & PBN"
1,Worst Movie Ever,Does not even come close to giving a look at what EOD is about. Makes all EOD techs look bad. As a Retired Navy EOD Tech I hate the movie. Bought it watched it then returned it. It is sort of like the 80's Navy Seals with Charlie Sheen. If they are going to make movies this poor then they should make a fictional Rate (job) in the military so not to disrespect them real Heros and Warriors.
5,Definitely a best-directed movie!,"When ""Zero Dark Thirty"" came out, I realized I should see Katherine Bigelow's first major work. This is a great documentary-style drama. Jeremy Renner is perfect as the bomb-disposal guy with PTSD."
3,this is just an ok rating,"I like it and it is the kind of movies that I like but it was way to long. The action was very slow and through out the movie the action did not change. The action remained slow and it was repeated through out the whole movie. I keep expecting the action and fighting to get intense but it never did. I heard so much about this movie and wanted to see it. After seeing it I was pretty disappointed in the film. Some of you might like this but I would not recommed this movie, it is not that great."
1,"Documentary style, without the substance","I would describe this attempt at a movie as a documentary, overly embellished, and without interesting voice-overs. I just kept waiting for something of substance to happen, and kept waiting, and that moment never came. I felt like I might learn something, but it's just about as dull in most points, as it is over-the-top in others, following the standard cliche of ""rules are meant to be broken."" The Academy cut off its nose to spite its face by giving this an award over the banal Cameron movie."
4,excellent,"The Hurt Locker is about the fog of war. The modern fog of war, with explosives, insurgants, cell phone detinators, where a servicepersons death can lay in the next trash pile, in the next pale blue Honda Civic. Any object we see every day.The story is about a bomb squad in Iraq, and you see them in constant danger under such circumstances. The acting is terrific. The story does not have a traditional arc, but that is really not what Hurt Locker is about. It is about the constant danger, over there.A lot of reviewers here who were there say this was not how it is. I am in no position to argue with them. But for a basic idea of how deadly the Iraq war can be--and for that matter any insurgent war we are now involved in--this is the movie to watch.Policy differances don't matter. For the Iraq war or opposed, we should all as Americans see this film"
1,A French Made Film That Sucks!,"Having served in the military i had thought it may have good performances, action scenes and so on.I soon realized very quickly that this is another failed attempt by a Frenchman that wishes he could direct and produce a military drama out of a documentary.Since the movie was released worldwide sooner than it opened in the states it was leaked onto torrent sites.Many people downloaded it but found out that it was just another poor foreign film.The producer, Nicolas Chartier claims he lost revenue to people downloading it so he is suing his fans that actually liked the film."
1,Worst Movie Ever,"I'v seen some bad movies in my time but this takes the cake, the plot is predictable and mind numbing, overall I'd rather watch godzilla with mathew brodrick or slide down razor blades into a vat of salt..."
2,The Hurt Locker,"The Hurt Locker was intense. It depicted the unnatural, demanding, hard, life-threatening life a soldier experiences in his/her daily routine. Very distressing for soldier and viewer. Stories based on fact are sometimes more frightening than fiction stories."
2,It was okay...definitely not worth an Oscar,"This movie is a series of vignettes without much of a plot. The main character is opaque, which is fine, but not for a movie which is character driven. Also, I found some of the action cliched. My husband and I were left thinking ""this is what all the fuss was about??"" Honestly, there were times when I was a little bored."
1,Do not sue people for enjoying your movie!,"The producers of this movie decided to sue everyone who downloaded it from p2p networks. That's thens of thousands of people, most of them probably big fans of this very film. That is not a good idea and for that I give the movie a lowest possible score."
1,"Hurt Locker, Hurt Audience","We've all heard the same old Hollywood mantra repeated ad nauseum: downloaded films fund fear/terror/crime/jihad/drugs/atheism/paedophilia, etc. and cost the industry and its overpaid ""talent"" untold millions in so-called lost revenue. However, Hurt Locker is set to put a new spin on that by actually making more money from prosecuting its audience over allegedly infringing downloads than it made at the box office. I don't think I have the stomach to recommend a film that seeks to criminalise its audience, and nor could I support it by shelling out for a DVD. I haven't seen this film; nor, on principal, do I want to--via any means. Hurt Locker, there goes another lost sale ..."
1,boring!,"dont get the hype either, tried so hard to like it and tried to enjoy it but the pacing is way to slow, it looked great and there were good actors in it, but it just dint work,wasn't griping at alltotally overrated."
3,Entertaining but average,"An entertaining two hours, but very unrealistic because of the risks taken by the ORD soldiers. Also, when one of the characters returned home, he longed to go back - in reality when you return home even the supermarket is a fun and fascinating place. Being deployed overseas is overrated (which all soldiers know), and so is this movie."
3,"Fair Action, Very implausible story line","From the opening scene, I had trouble w/ the details in the film. When the wheel on the trailer falls off, the guy in the explosive suit removes the explosives and neatly lays them on the IED. I don't think dropping the trailer off would have been so neat. The way the bomb squad leaves the base and arrives before other teams is also unbelievable.The fact the academy showered this movie w/ awards just confirms my thoughts- at least half of them are nuts!"
1,Hurt Locker,All of the reviews of this movie were great. We were not impressed. It was very slow moving and not what we expected.
4,one i couldn't put down,Another great story by Linda Warren. I am enthralled by the McCain saga. This was a book that kept me up most of the night i couldn't seem to put it down. It shows that although no family is perfect we learn to live with and love the ones we are handed. Caroline and Eli make a stunning combination.And it was great to see how jake and elise with little ben was doing .
2,Compendium of unconnected number factoids,"This a dictionnary comprised of number theory factoids. Admittedly it is well researched, but I found it dry and hard to get into. You must know quite a bit of number theory to appreciate the subject matter, which will limit the appeal of the book to the layman.I just happen to think that what makes MATH interesting is the interconnectedness of ideas and facts?Let's hope Wells can get back to writing an ideas book, instead of yet another dictionary.sigh..."
3,Ok,"The bag made it to Mexico and back so that's good. It's a pain to carry around if it's not pretty full. The handle needs an adjustable strap, then it would be almost perfect."
2,Another modern choral recording,"Why our modern choral conductors have insisted that just because music has a chorus in it means that it has to be constantly up tempo, dry, and clear. This is Beethoven, not Monteverdi! There is absolutely nothing inspiring about this recording, it is simply the notes as they are written. If that is your thing (all you Robert Shaw fans), then by all means, buy this recording, but if you like your Beethoven to sound like Beethoven, find another one. All of the above applies to both the mass and the oratorio."
5,Battery tender 800 12v dual charger,"Item looks excellent and works great. The two quick connect clamps included allowed me to hook up both atv's without worries of dead battery when ready to ride in winter. I would highly reccommend.Kids love the reving sound when you connect assuring you thet the battery is connected properly. Can;t beat the price on a dual charger,period!!"
2,Specific uses,"This product is good for smaller batteries, Lawn Mower, motorcycles, etc. Not so good for car batteries or Marine batteries."
3,Strange game,"Loved this game when I was a kid for the puzzles and bizarre ambience. Never thought I would see it again, but lo the wonders of amazon!Just a warning, this game will not work unless you run it in comparability mode in xp home. I have to run it on a vm, but it works. Resolution ain't so great on modern monitors, but you can't be too picky when you are playing a 14 year old game on a modern machine."
3,Great for a little over a year.,"I ordered this module as a replacement from the stock version I had on my 1988 Chevy Pickup, after it went bad. I took the old one out cleaned up the mess that was on the distributor, put on the new ""heat sink grease"" that came with it and put everything back together. It fired up right away. My truck ran good for a little over a year and I had to replace it again. This time I went to Napa auto parts and bought the OEM style and it's been there for around 3 years now. Maybe I got a bad one from Accel, don't know, but it didn't last like it should have."
3,"Good Game...cute, but not the best one","This is a cute Leapster game..not a wide variety of different games, but still good for the Scooby-Doo lover. My son plays it regularly. What is nice about this game is you can pick 2 players and have your kids play against each other or you.Level 3 is hard...much more difficult math problems, which is very good!Worth the money!"
2,Still Love the Character but not the game,"My 5 year old daughter is a huge Scooby Doo fan. She loves anything with Scooby Doo and was excited to find this game. So when I finally got this game for her, the excitement wore off quickly. She loves many of her other Leapster games that offer various games to play and different levels. This game only does the one game with the same objective of throwing food at monsters when you answer a math problem correctly. Not what I expected at all! I would check out the other Scooby Doo game for Leapster 2 as that may have more options for the kids to play."
2,Very snug,"I purchased these shoes for my 2.5 year old, and was very disappointed that they didn't fit. Although the length is correct, the height of the shoe seems very shallow; I was not able to slip my son's foot in at all. I am willing to believe he has chunky feet, but I have never run into this problem with him before."
1,Another disappointing MW:DA novel,"This book was pure torture to read. The characters were mostly sterotypical and, as with many of the MW:DA novels, I didn't really care what happened to them.The battles in this book were extremely unbelievable and annoying. Somehow minners and farmers who had little to no training or experiance and piloted Industial Mechs were able to land hit after hit, while elite and experianced mercenaries piloting battlemechs missed their shots almost every time.This was one of those books where you find yourself hoping for the ""bad guys"" to win. I'd advise anyone who dislikes constant pain while reading to avoid this book."
3,Recommend for PRESCHOOLERS,"This game is way to easy to engage any child over 5. Because the age range indicated on the box is 5-8, I thought my 7 year old son would love this game because he loves animals. It is just WAY to easy, thus making the game boring. A younger child would probably love it."
3,Kids love it.,"My 7 & 5 year old love this game. But the games don't advance properly. Before my 5 year old had ""won"" all the animals in each area, he advanced beyond the capacity of 3 of the 4 games and the games simply quit running. (my son's smart but not THAT smart) He can sign in as a different user and start all over again, but he can't finish under his original sign in name.I would not buy this game again unless for a 3-4 year old."
1,poor quality,The vibrating unit only operates if it is within a few INCHES of the main unit. I cannot place it under the mattress as the directions state because even that short distance is too far. It was a useless purchase.
4,Works Great!,"Our daughter loves the vibrate function of this. It is nice to have it turn itself on when she wakes up. We originally had problems with our Fisher Price Dual Sounds and Lights monitor with this, then I realized they were interfering with each other. I moved the monitor across the room and now they both work great. The symptoms of this were the vibrate wouldn't work unless the box was within inches of the vibrate box. I highly recommend, but be willing to move items in the nursery around to avoid interference."
2,Not great,"Our newborn daughter turned out to be a car baby, that is she fell asleep easily in a running vehicle. Because of this we purchased a vibrating bouncer chair, however we did not want her to sleep in that chair all the time. After doing research we settled on this unit. It did not work well at all. We have an Ikea crib that the under the mattress vibrating unit will NOT mount on. Also, the communication between the control unit and the vibrator was horrible at best. The vibrations would last about 45 seconds and then stop unless we were touching the control unit. The only reason I gave this a second star was the audio capability of the control unit. It was very soothing to the baby."
3,Not worth much money,"Simple and plain but not totally cheap looking. Unfortunately the chain and wiring provided is only long enough for a single, straight hang of the light. I have 9' ceilings and the electric box is not over my table so I need to loop the chain to a ceiling hook - but the chain and wiring is about 12-19"" too short. So it's totally useless for me. It's about worth the seventeen dollars shipped I got it for but not a whole lot more."
3,tube top,"well, I got this top and its not totally bad. It does come with a built in bra but the problem, like all tube tops, is that it needs to constantly be lifted because it goes down a lot. I would suggest buying a size larger since it is short and you may need more room for your breasts in the bra."
2,Upset customer,I finally received the dvd which I purchased as new. Received it after a month of waiting I got a hold of seller he forgot about the order and rushed one to me. I did get the product but it was not new. The plastic was not on the product and the cover has a tear in it and I was lead to believe I was purchasing a new one since I paid 18.00 for this? The dvd works but I will never buy from Amazon again.
1,This is NOT the Veggie Tales of old.,"I am usually lover and supporter of the Veggie Tales series however, this video Pirates Who Don't Do Anything: A Veggie Tales Movie crossed the line. It started off by asking if I wanted to override the parental controls. What? Then here comes the secular movie advertisements, all of which are unable to bypass/fast forward. After seeing some scary ghost scene, I took the DVD out of the player, put it back in the case, and tossed it in the trash. Maybe not the best decision but I needed to do this. BEWARE of videos after 2003, they are worldly influenced."
5,Great entertainment for kids,"This movie is a keeper, one that I'm happy for my children to watch over and over. The graphics and music make it highly entertaining and eye catching, and the message is a valuable one. I recommend this movie to anyone looking for great, wholesome entertainment for their kids!"
5,Pirates,"I bought this video for my youngest grandson, Hayden, 3yrs old and when he tore into the paper he had this big smile on his face and said ""this is what I have always wanted"". We watched it that night along with his other cousins, ranging from 2 to 4 years old. My grandson loves all of the Veggie Tale movies and this is one I know we will be watching over and over again."
2,Scary and not much point,"We are Veggie Tales fans and chose this to watch with our 3, 5, and 7 year olds. I regret it. We almost turned it off a couple of times, but decided to keep going, hoping it would redeem itself. All three of our kids were scared to the point of covering their eyes or ears at various times. Whether it was the pirates themselves, the scary storms and ocean scenery, the attacking cheese curls, the giant walking rocks, the dragon, the dungeon scenes, etc., there was plenty of scary stuff in here and little other content to make this a movie I can recommend. If your kids don't scare easily and really love pirates and all that they are about, you might like this movie, but it seems to me as if the creators had a hit song and forced it into a movie. They should have left it at the song in my opinion."
5,Extraordinary,"A Likely Story covers the extraordinary events in the author's life from the age of eight into his seventh decade. This is a fascinating narrative and written with candor, whether relating to the adventures of childhood, the sometimes arduous process of growing into adulthood, or the tragedies that life has a way of inflicting upon us. The thing I love most about this book is the wonderful sense of humor. I found myself laughing out loud while reading numerous accounts. This is a truly remarkable story. Audrey"
3,Tenth printing,"While I've always loved Irene Haas's beautiful illustrations (I saw them in person at a children's book workshop when the book orginally came out-they were even better in real life), I don't think the production values on this book have been held over the years. If you get a good copy of an early printing, it may still have the clear colors it should have. But I recently bought one from the tenth printing and, sadly, the interior colors were muddy while the jacket was overly forced into brightness on a strange stock.I still love the story-not too scary and has a gentle, soothing ending which is perfect for bedtime. If you're not a picky person in book production, like me, it will still be one of your favorites."
5,Great tool for imagination,"So much is done for kids these days. The toys talk to them, even some books do. They lead very passive lives. This book is about a child and her imagination and the sea voyage she dreams of one evening. It is a great story complimented well by great illustrations and is sure to enccourage your child to dream ""in color."" Also, with the songs, it makes an excellent read aloud book."
5,Strong and well-made; dimensions are confusing,"These bags are very strong and well-made. However, I was confused by the dimensions: I returned the 21x36 bag and ordered a larger one. As the bag is more or less round when packed with soft items like clothes, I had assumed that 21"" was the diameter. In fact, 21"" is the width when the bag is folded flat (i.e., half the circumference); so the true diameter of the 21x36 is only about 14.5"" (or 0.7 times the stated width); or, if the back is packed with something square, each of the four sides measures half the stated width (i.e., 10.5"" for the 21x36)."
4,Nice color,"Liked it so much, replaced it after it was stolen at the airport. (Lost Luggage) Husband has shoes to match. Great buy."
4,Good book,Very encouraging! What an awesome testimony of how the Lord can restore something broken. Would recommend this book to anyone who just needs to be reminded about how much God loves us.
4,Good Inside Look At Skating in the Cold War....,"I bought this book when it came out around 1994/95 and re-read it recently. The best part of this book is the section where Ms. Wilkes, a Canadian Olympic medalist in pairs, talks about her experiences coming up in the sport. It's a great read and gives the reader a lot of insight into what the sport was like at the height of the Cold War. The rest of the book is basically commentary on skating at the time the book was written. I thoroughly enjoyed the parts that talked about Kurt and Elvis, but I didn't really agree with some of her favorites in the ladies' department (she also doesn't seem to be much of a fan of Kristi Yamaguchi, who is one of my favorite skaters, so that might have something to do with it). But this is a minor complaint. Buy this book for the great retrospective on the 1994 Olympic season and for Ms. Wilkes'very absorbing tales of skating in the 1960s."
5,Fun letters,"These stick well to our tile shower walls, the bathtub, and texured ""glass"" shower door. There is only one of each letter and number, so spelling words is difficult, but they are good for letter recognition. My daughter is 2 yrs and she has fun with them."
5,Perfect!,The Vortex Crossfires are the absolute best binoculars for bird-watching. Very fast focus no matter what the distance is. I would recommend these binoculars to anyone for any purpose. All around great pair of binoculars. Great buy!!!
2,"Interesting premise, but....","This book was poorly written, and the characters shallow and trite. The book was based on an interesting premise, however, just poorly executed."
5,JoJo's Review,I am a die hard SugaFree fan. Unfortunately I moved back to the midwest and I cannot get none of his underground stuff. Keep it pimpin SugaFree.
3,Outdated Dating,"Please check the published date and you will find that some of the references to dating are a bit outdated. With the help of online dating these days, I think you tend to meet half way when it comes to a first date! The book references alot of 'when you see him in a bar...' today, my girlfriends and I are using online dating sites so rules apply a bit differently. I certainly would not give my address out to someone I had just met in a bar or online to pick me up at my place, I think it's perfectly acceptable in this day and age to meet out!The 3 stars were given because I found the book to be quite amusing...the Author does have a way with words!"
4,Good but needs more...,"I read the book cover to cover and really enjoyed it, but I felt like she needed to flesh out her chapters a little more. For instance, where are we supposed to meet all of these available guys? How do we flirt appropriately (not desperately) so they will ask us out? And honestly, the whole part of not paying for part of my date is just a little awkward. I don't know how to let a guy pay for the date, unless he's stated from the beginning that he intends to pay. I am all about letting guys show their interest by investing more into the relationship, especially in the courting stages, but I just don't know how."
1,Advice to catch a game player,"Her main advice is don't call a man...I understand that men like a little chase, but if you want to continue to play games and/or show a man that you are uninterested (by not calling him back), then buy this book. Her advice is dated."
1,Exactly,If it wasn't just 1-7 but 1-8 I would have ought it but unfortunately they didn't wait.Well maybe they'll make an another whole seasons box who knows?
1,Requiem? I don't think so!!,"Well I am going to start out by saying that almost every part of the Mozart Requiem when conducted by Jordi Savall takes at least one whole minute shorter to play. That is why he added that five minute long piece at the beginning of the CD. I have a copy of the score and printed in big clear letters at the beginning of the first part is says ADAGIO. Now maybe Jordi can't see that or he thought it said ANDANTE. But either way, this is the most horrible recording of the Mozart Requiem.The only time I ever listen to this recording is to laugh at it.DO NOT BUY IT!!"
3,grrr,"I love this book. I carry it with meto read/study when I have some spare time.But the typos are killing me. There's at least 4on the 1st page of the Preface. And the most helpfulpicture in the explanation of Mosfets (Figure 4.65)is significantly wrong.I'm looking forward to a new, corrected edition."
5,Best Overview of Electronics Around,"Good introductory books on electronics are rare birds. This book is a rare breed indeed. The scope of this book shocked me, from the section on explanating the root underlining reasons where complex impedance theory came from, to describing the core machine codes used by a microprocessors and microcontrollers. What really caught my attention was the manner in which the author explaned things. I can't quite explain a similar style--somewhat like a physicist, somewhat like an artist, somewhat like an engineer, and somewhat like an inventor. This combination of styles gave the subject matter practical, theoretical and imaginative qualities that made learning a rewarding expierence. This is not to say this book will be the only one you'll need for designing your circuits--but it's the best starter I came across by far."
2,A disappointment,"I am a member of the forensics community, and thought this book might help me learn more about the other areas I am not familiar with, but it didn't. The material did not flow within the chapters, and I found several mistakes/misinformations. Also, the chapter on DNA technology was mostly negative. There are many positive aspects to DNA testing, but Mr. Zonderman didn't seem to want to address them. All in all, the book was a disappointment."
1,Another disappointment... :(,"The way this book is put togther is what leaves me feeling a bit ripped off. I feel the author and/or publisher owe me some money! At least one third of the book was copied over from manufacturer's free publications. If you want to read a list of available programming instructions contained within the language written about in the book just vist the mfg web site and save your money. And, Hex listings in the book! Give me a break! You can read what this book has to offer in under an hour! This book stinks..."
3,Does the job,I've never owned one of these before so it was quite a challenge to get in place on the basketball rim. Since it is somewhat difficult to put back on it is not getting the use I had hoped for from my son. This product is made of plastic but seems to be pretty sturdy. It does catch the ball well and returns it to a predictable place on the court allowing more time for shooting and less time chasing. If there was a way to assign a 3.5 rating I would give it the extra half point.
1,"Everyone has a bad day, and this was one of Bill's.","Having listened to ""Wonderfulness"", ""A Very Funny Fellow, Right!"", ""To Russell..."", and ""Why Is There Air"", I was unsure whether this was actually Bill Cosby. It was flat and uninspired. The others were great! This one is going to the CD Swap to get some money back."
1,an ordeal for me to read,I bought this book on the strength of the back cover reviews which compared the book to that of other well known travel writers. However I found the book to be boring and in the end too much of an ordeal to persevere with.
2,Not as Good as the Original,"I purchased these after losing one of the original cushions off my Sony earbuds recently. The replacements are a thinner material that is too soft to stay properly fitted in your ear. I find it necessary to constantly readjust the earpiece with the new cushion so that it properly seals. My earbuds are the noise cancelling type, and a good seal is very important to properly eliminate outside noise. Any jaw movement seems to dislogde it, so eating, drinking or chewing gum makes the headset useless with the new cushions.Also, like other reviewers, it is ridiculous that you have to purchase all three sizes of replacement cushions to get the one size you need. Why not sell a package that includes all one size? If you are buying replacements, you pretty well know what size you need.Bottom line, they work, but not very well. I would not recommend this item."
3,best rhymes?,"I was a little confused with this one. As with the Loc'd out cd, there were no liner notes or anything to let you know who produced the tracks or who the unlisted featured artists were. Also, this cd had a lot of recycled tracks on it from other cds put out by dogg pound members. However, the recycled tracks were some of the better efforts put out by goldie loc, so its not that bad. This guy needs to hook back up with Tray Deee when he gets out and put out another awesome Eastsidaz cd."
4,Great,"I have Track and its not the season for track yet, but I want to practice. I couldn't find a discus anywhere and especially the ones we use, I'm so glad I found it and for such a cheap price. Buying it was easy, now I just have to master throwing it..."
1,Would LOVE to review if it had ever shipped....,"I did not ever receive this item even though it is fully paid for. I would have been happy to share a different review, like one that actually talks about the product. But it is not to be, apparently. Not impressed."
1,I hope aliens eat Kris Bhat,"I am scared to think of the sheltered world that the author has established for his children. Those poor, poor souls."
2,Did Not Work to Keep Toddler Out of DVD Player,"I'm not sure why I thought this would be any different than it turned out to be, but it's just a piece of plastic. And it covers the place where the DVD slides in and out of the player. Baby wasn't more than 1.5 (probably less) and quickly figured out how to move the DVD player so that she could still push all the buttons. This product was not the solution. The solution was to put that DVD player out of reach. Why didn't I think of that first??"
1,Not very satisfied,"This didn't work at all for my 13 month old. It's pretty flexible plastic so she was able to just go up and pull it away from the machine and push the buttons anyway. Also, you attach it with squares of hook and loop and when the machine warms up they let go. Maybe if I had started using it sooner it would work better into fooling her that she couldn't push buttons. But if you have a curious and busy toddler like mine with any persistence at all, this probably isn't going to work very well."
2,Poor construction,"It is a great idea, to be able to exchange every part of the figure, but it has giant joint ball marbles that come apart too easily. Some of the joints are just those steel marbles connecting other parts of the figure. HE fell apart when I took him out of the plastic, was nearly impossible to hold the figure without him coing apart in my hands. The marbles can easily get lost.I would suggest going with Mag Warriors by Mega Blocks, they are normal action figure size, and they dont fall apart if you pick them up. There is a less likely chance of loosing parts, since all the joint marbles are mounted on the torso and the limbs have the magnets. They are also much better looking. Who has ever seen or heard of a purple Viking."
2,A Landing on the Sun,"Totally ureal premise regarding the title; took slogging forever to get into. Best thing to say, ""weird, but it is British, you know."""
4,Understanding Motivations,"Mirroring others who have similar chemistry to mine has given me insights into difficult relationships. Recognizing my own misconduct in these relationships because of similarities in our reactions has freed me from misinterpreting motivations. I have been given a key to understanding.I do not agree totally with the author's life-style, a bit New Age, but some of his principals are well thought out and a true discovery."
5,A must read for every person on this earth,Such an important part of learning about life! Get it for yourself and give it away as a gift. So great!
3,New Age wrapped in Christainity,"I read the reviews and bought the book. I agree with some of the reviewers that this book does have a lot of New Age principles in it, however in saying that, it's also very Christian centered, which is not bad, but not what I was looking for. I was hoping to find a book less focused on religion and more directed to finding forgiveness.It wasn't a bad book, but not what I was expecting."
5,Moore's movies are less abrasive every time,"i've seen all of michael moore's films but i didn't really like his stuff until ""sicko"" came out. and, now having seen this one it seems he has matured as a film maker and a person. this film is more sensitive, thoughtful, and thorough than his others (with the exception of ""sicko""). he still has his wise ass, comedic moments but it doesn't detract from the message as it did in ""farenheit 9/11"" and ""bowling for columbine"". this is a good film. it's tame enough to watch with your kids and you'll learn something, even if you don't agree with everything."
2,Capitalism: A confusing story,As a democrat I have to say Moore is really out there. He fails to realize off the bat that the gov is involved with evicting those homes. He fails to mention freddy and fanny being responsible for these people not being able to pay. He leaves out any kind of hint that the government allows all this to happen and is involved. I don't think he understands corporatism vs. capitalism.
5,Required Viewing for all Economic Students,Brings the history of America and its development from WWII until the late 1980's when we were the best of the best intoa new broader prospective.
5,"Informative, bit one-sided but good!","Informative, a bit one-sided, but pretty good.Rich get richer...works if you're rich. :)I learned many things which I didn't know, like companies profiting from life insurance policies on their employees. Dr. Salk giving away the polio vaccine, derivatives, get senior citizens out of their homes, etc.A bit socialistic, but informative none the less. ""Welfare, union, WE??"" (from the Constitution)I liked STEVEN Moore's, columnist of WSJ, comment about capitalism > democracy. US constitution DOESN'T GUARANTEE happiness!There are people offering alternatives.So, if we try hard enough we'll make it right?"
5,Great movie!,"""Capitalism: A Love Story"" is a great movie that adresses the issues of a poorly regulated free marketplace.Very good!"
5,Michael does it again,"Once again Michael Moore shows us on film what we might never have a chance to go out and see for ourselves. For those criticizing this film as anti American, America is not just about money. This great nation is about our people, their talents, their drive, their dreams. Pointing out where greed has gotten out of control and is hurting families and striking at the heart of our strength, our people, is what Michael Moore has done in this film. Thank you, Michael."
1,LOL,"A big fat socialist who makes millions of dollars attacking the very system that allowed him to prosper. Surely you jest. Solution, stay in Cuba next time comrade."
2,Old Cologne?,"I have worn this cologne for years and I love it. The dept stores have stopped carrying it . I ordered it on Amazon and it just is not the same. The scent is ok, but the scent is so weak, that it doesnt even last until I get to work. very very dissapointed with the cologne and the entire process with Amazon on this order."
5,Sung By Alfred Sung,Sung By alfred Sung has been and continues to be my favorite scent to wear. I often get wonderful compliments when I wear it.
2,Deceptive - TESTER,"The add was very decieptive, it showed the product with the packaging, however what I received was a tester. This was not mentioned or shown anywhere in the add. If I purchased it for myself I wouldn't be so upset, but this was supposed to be a Christmas present! Sucks."
5,Finally found this,My wife has been looking for this for a while. It was also only a fraction of the cost in stores.
3,Moon Cycles review,I bought it as a relaxation recording and it wasn't consistently relaxing. I had only heard a portion of the music before ordering the CD
3,"less than expected, but still good","I absolutely LOVED Chocolat and could not wait to get my hands on a copy of Five Quarters of the Orange ~ when I finally did, I was a little less than impressed. The story of the shocking and tragic scandal that drove the Dartigen family from their home in the small French village of Les Laveuses during the German occupation was doled out so slowly that by the time the truth was revealed, I hardly cared.Five Quarters of the Orange definitely lacks the charm and wicked humor of it's predecessors, Chocolat and Blackberry Wine, but is probably worth a try if you're looking for a darker, more serious read.Joanne Harris is unquestionably a talented author and I look forward to her next effort."
5,Read straight through in one day,"If you haven't read the book don't read too many comments here. A lot of people give too much of the book away.I read this book straight through in one day. I haven't done that since I was a kid. It seems all I read now are technical computer books for work so this was a real delight. I recommend it to everyone. I read it so my wife and I could do something together and finished it before she got home from her book club. What a beautiful book, what a refreshing change of pace. I am eager to read fiction again. Thank you Joanne."
2,Five Quarters fo the Orange,I just didn't like the way the book was written. Didn't enjoy the story line. I had to wait a long time to receive this book. I guess there was a problem with the shipping.
1,Maybe good fighter Poor Instructors,Some people can fight and some people can instruct and some people can do both. This is not a good instruction tool.
1,Scanner software (was) terrible,"Mac OS X purchasers should check the HP support website before trying to install for information on how to keep the installation program from hanging. They also should search the web for advice on how to remove the intrusive icon from the dock, and keep it from returning. There are more that 10,000 items that are installed and no custom install option to avoid the unnecessary stuff. Using the scanner requires that the psc be turned off, the computer restarted, and then the psc turned back on--EACH TIME. (2/23/05 review)HP has updated the software since my initial review. The software is still bloated and there is no custom install, but at least it works now and Director no longer keeps reinstalling itself on the dock."
4,I like 'em.,"I bought this set of leads to extend my meter's 'reach' and I use them for low voltage continuity checking. Work just great for me.Are they made from thin wire? Yes. Are they crimped, not soldered? Yes. Are they ten pieces for less than five dollars? You bet! A trip to the 'Shack would cost me almost a gallon of gas. Much better to have Amazon deliver to my door.My only con would be the slick vinyl on the alligator clips. For me, this has a tendency to 'squirt' the clips out of the vinyl cover. A small learning curve."
3,SE Clip Test Lead Set (10 Piece),"Yes, they're very inexpensive.HOWEVER, they have 2 SEVERE FAULTS:1) The plastic clip insulator covers are EXTREMELY SLIPPERY ! They have no good excuse for this stupidity.2) MUCH MORE IMPORTANTLY, THE WIRES ARE NOT SOLDERED TO THE CLIPS. They are POORLY CRIMPED. This guarantees poor electrical connections. Having to carefully re-open the crimps, tin the wire ends and the clips, solder the wires and then re-crimp the wires is a **very** time-consuming PITA !!! THIS PROCEDURE IS ***ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY*** TO GUARANTEE PROPER ELECTRICAL CONNECTIONS.There seems to be no competitive products, alas."
2,Se Clip Test Lead Set,"These clip leads win the prize for the absolute worst item I ever bought, So sorry I didn't read the previous reviews first.The Clips themselves are ok but the wire is such a tiny gauge and the insulation on the wire is equally as terrible making a very fragile clip lead at best."
2,pain in the,the vinyl is not attached to the wire so: the insulating vinyl is more slippery than a sardine in oil so the clip rotates in your hand when trying to attach themthen the vinyl sleeve slips back along the wire negating any insulation effect sorry I bought them
2,They work but for how long?,This product is extremely CHEAPLY made. The clips are standard clips but the boot covering the clips is really low quality. On top of that the wire can't be 16 AWG there is just no way. Its more like 20+. Then put that together with the fact that the plastic sheathing is just garbage. To put it in context have you ever left an orange extension cord out in the sun for a long time and the sun has faded the color and broken down the plastic? That is what this wire is like. Like another person said if it wouldn't cost me more then the products worth I would return them. If I get a chance I will post a photo.
2,Wires Are Too Thin For RF Use Up to 10 MHz,"I bought some of these, but when I got them, they worked good, but somehow the wire was thin. I tried to use them with my antenna experiments, but they were kinda lossy for low frequency to HF use. They come in handy for quick connections to shortwave radio antennas that cover from 1 kHz to 10 MHz. After 10 MHz the signalmay become lossy. They work good for temporary installations and breadboarding, engineering, and for power supplies, and battery connections. I would buy them again if I had the money, they work just as good as regular 24 gauge wire, but I would not recommend them for voltages higher than 12 volts. I would recommend types that are more thicker than these stranded pieces of spaghetti."
5,The Heart of Reiki,"I found this album on youtube in part and loved it. I went searching for the full album and bought it. I am not into meditation, but I love this music. I usually put it on and listen to it as I work at my computer in the morinings. Coffee and Reiki are a great combo."
2,Good Grief,"If you are easily frustrated or a little uncoordinated, forget this. I've done many exercise classes (one taught by a dancer) and step aerobics, this gives you no chance to learn. I'm so disappointed. They jump right in, and by the time I had half a chance to master a step, they were already throwing something else into the mix. This is not for the fainthearted."
2,Graphic SF Reader,"This is easily the lamest of these trades so far. In the comic, they are making a Spider-Man movie. Just a pathetic plot, pretty much. So, he isn't happy, neither is Dr Octopus, whose wife has sold rights to her story to the producers.He breaks out, wants to get even, ends up fighting Spider-Man in a plane to Brazil.Gwen Stacy finds out who he is by breaking into stuff in his room. The rest is rubbish."
4,Great Book!,This Book Was a great help to me. I read it in a couple of days and now I'm going back through to do what it's telling me to do. This helped a lot...that's all I'm going to Say! Get It!
3,Haven't I seen this some where before?,"This is an abbreviated version of the book ""Secrets of a Golden Dawn Temple"" by the Ciceros. This book is newer and doesn't have the instructions on how to actually make the tools. It is just a guide on how to use them. So if you already have Secrets, you don't need this volume."
2,Only One Mighty Mouse Cartoon,"Fair quality copy of one public domain Mighty Mouse short: ""Wolf, Wolf"" from 1944. Released to television December 1955, only 25 of the total 80 Mighty Mouse shorts were even made in the 1950s; majority are 1940s cartoons."
3,It's only okay,"For the price of this phone, it works okay. The answering machine is easy to use, and the buttons on the machine and the phone are big and easy to push. But there is an echo in the phone so any background noise makes it hard to hear the person you're talking to. I also found a lot of static, when my last phone had no static at all (which was also a 2.4gh AT&T;, just different model)I would not recommend this phone.."
4,"Dual 5 1/4"" Outdoor speakers","Even though these are made by Dual, a recognized quality manufacturer, the packaging seemed a bit flimsy for the product and surprisingly the speakers took no damage from shipping. As someone else mentioned, the ""heft"" of the speakers was a pleasant surprise, which generally means better quality / larger magnets, for speakers.Installation is very easy, mounting a breeze, allowing a great deal of horizontal adjustment while mounted. There is no vertical adjustment however, so pick your location with care.The sound is crisp, and volume quite a bit higher than standard bookshelf speakers hooked to the same receiver. Unfortunately the bass is somewhat disappointing even though I have mine mounted in corners.Overall good bang for the buck, you will probably be hard pressed to get better at this price."
2,Disappointing Deal,"Purchased this for our daughter as she loves the TV show. The game continually froze...thus making it a frustrating to say the least. When it was working, we found it boring. During the process of choosing a case number to open next, we had to use the up and down arrows as the remaining case numbers were displayed on the screen one at a time. It was slow. With that being said we will have to try it on a different DVD player as other reviews here have had different results based on the machine they used. Who knows!?!?"
1,2 Copies: Both copies did not work!,We looked forward to playing this game. Do not buy this product. As others have posted...the game freezes up. Both copies I bought freeze as soon as you get to the point when the banker is to appear. Game does not work beyond that point. Disc acutally gets stuck at times in the dvd player.
1,"For me, it was a no deal","I got this as a x-mas present. First off, it wouldn't play in my regular DVD player, so I had to stick it in my computer DVD. On top of that, you have to sit through Howie's opening schtick with every game. On top of that, the selection of briefcases is tedious. You have to go through them one by one until you want the case of your choice. When I played this, the deal went up even when I selected a case with a high amount. It just wasn't fun. How did this even get approved by NBC and Endemol? They should've done their homework on this one because it was tedious and just not fun. Thankfully, it was returned to Wal-Mart. When approched to get this game, just say ""no deal""."
5,Great game to play!!,I purchased this gift for my dad for christmas. He is a huge fan of the show! this game is easy enough for both my parents to play plus their grandkids love this game also!! i have played this game also and found it to be a lot of fun! this game is just like the t.v show it's like you are actually on the show. I would recommend this game it's a lot of fun!!
3,its ok but kinda boring after a while,I love the gameshow on tv and this dvd is ok ..although you dont see the models during gameplay and where you pick the cases is not the same as on tv either..its ok for a little while but gets boring quick..
1,Absolutely Terrible,"1. Game is slow, unresponsive and glitchy2. The interface is poorly designed; you can only see one case at a time, eliminating the visual of seeing all the cases and knowing which ones you have left, which defeats the entire purpose of the game.3. While choosing cases the game is totally silent. There is no music or banter from HowieOverall:This game is painfully boring and poorly made. It is ridiculous that a game this bad was approved for distribution. All those responsible should be fired."
3,Deal or no Deal DVD game,"I bought this game for my dad for Christmas, he loves this show. We played it over the holiday and had a blast. The only bad thing is it's a little on the slow side. But we still had fun. Great family fun for slower non-gaming people!"
2,Kinda lame,"I heard It takes a fool to remain sane in Norway and it blew me away. I bought the CD and was horribly dissappointed. THe songs are very lame and corny. It has 4 good songs, 1 ok song, and A fool to remain sane which is fantastic. A fool is the second star I gave. If you like A fool to remain sane don't expect all the songs to be like that one. Listen before you buy. It's a waste of money in my oppinion but other people might like it."
1,not fitted,This sheet is not fitted on my standard PackNPlay mattress. I do not use it because it is too lose.
2,Too big for the pak n play...,keeping it only because I had washed it before putting it on the mattress... wouldn't buy again or recommend. --
3,B+,"There is a better book on the topic. Take a look at Campus Free College Degrees: Thorsons Guide to Accredited College Degrees Through Distance Learning by Marcie K. Thorson and read my review. Plus, it costs less. You will be spending a lot of money to get a college degree, so do your research thoroughly! Thorson's guide will help you do that."
4,Great Resource,"If you are looking for a resource that will provide literally thousands of addresses (snail mail, e-mail, web addresses, phone numbers) with a brief annotation about each school that offers distance learning, then this is an excellent resource. If you are wanting to learn the very basics of accreditation of online schools, this will be a starting point. If you want a detailed, technical look at online learning and about higher education accreditatiion, this is not the purpose of Bears Guide.Reviewer: Dr. Kellemen is the author of Beyond the Suffering: Embracing the Legacy of African American Soul Care and Spiritual Direction ."
4,The real side of wrestling,"Shaun Assael gives the reader a glimpse in the controversial world of wrestling. From highschool gyms to sell out crowds in major arenas, this book gives a personal look into the lives of the McMahon family, Ted Turner, and everyone else who built these wrestling companies into the mainstream sports entertainment in which they are in now. Prepare to be shocked on how real wrestling really is..."
2,This is a REAL story?,"This book definitely didn't live up to it's title. Most of the 200+ pages are just the same old stories that can be found on any wrestling web site. Also, much of the book isn't even devoted to Vince McMahon and the WWF. It's clear that Assael put Vince McMahon in the title for name recognition alone. It is comprable to the movie Beyond the Mat putting the Rock on their poster. This book is pure propaganda as Assael jumps on the anti-Vince bandwagon."
4,Shows How Wrestling Has Changed,"I loved it when they talked about how they used to tape 3 weeks worth of wrestling in 1 day at the allentown fairgrounds.I remember those days when I used to watch wrestling every Saturday afternoon on my local uhf station.Those were the good old days.That's when wrestling was wrestling.Remember Bob Backlund,Ken Patera,Ivan Putski,Larry Zbyszko,Hulk Hogan (pre hulkamania days). Now wrestling is just a circus..."
2,A Good Book...for a new fan...,"This book sounded like it would be an interseting read, about Vince McMahon and the WWF. However, the book rarely touches on either subject in depth and without bias. There was no topic metioned that a fan of a few years would not be familiar with. All stories in the book have already been covered online, in magazines, and other books. The biggest dissapointment overall was the fact that book focused most of its energy on federations other than the WWF. It gives a decent account of the other wrestling organizations without the negitive slant the WWF is veiwed in by the author. The book in no way lives up to its title."
5,Great little dishes,"I bought these to match the Simple Lines dishes that I have, but they would really work with any simple dishes. I got them mainly for giving my kids maple syrup to dip, but I have ended up using them for many other things. They are a little bigger and deeper than my ramekin dishes so they hold a little more.We use them for little candies, controlling portions of ice cream (I have a tendency to fill the bowl even if it is big!)ketchup, dyeing easter eggs, single serve apple cobblers, jello, even pennies and paper clips. I find myself reaching for these so often, they have earned a front place on the shelf!I would also like these in an even bigger size maybe 10 or 12 oz size, but I don't think they are offered in this shape."
2,Not Challenging,"I've tried quite a few Pilates videos and this is one I would not recommend. When I started the video, I was really disappointed to see that a pilates band was required for the exercises. But nowhere on the box did it mention that. There were a few movements such as leg circles, rolling and the mermaid that are done without a band but most of the workout requires it. Thankfully I rented this and didn't spend money on it."
2,poor quality,I just received 6 Divas (white wine glass) and was shocked to see that they are not round on the inside. As you twirl the stem you can see a wavering inside the glass. They are not as thin and delicate as Riedel and Spiegelau and others. I broke two of my red wine Zwiesels last week in my all plastic dishwasher. I do not see the advantage of this brand for drinking and enjoying wine.
4,Can't wait to drop one!!!,"Have the Riedel glass ware and already have a 'nick' in rim of one costing about $12 each....knew that day would happen and just chalked it up to 'doing business'.ENTER TRITAN:PROS:- it truly is no different than Riedel glass ware- HOLDS UP TO DISHWASHER- HOLDS UP TO CASUAL SMACKING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!- ALL the above = the only reason to NEVER buy a Riedel or other stemware of Lead Glass again.CONS:- CANNOT hold up to a hammer: no, haven't tried this yet...really want to...but, well, perhaps after that special Sonoma Carnneros red....I will ceremoniously, accidentally, have one 'slip' from my fingers on the balcony over that blasted patio brick near the fushia......'ok, i dream'...NAW< I'm going to do it, will report back on that later."
4,best when high,This thing is a hell of a trip. Mirabella is my hero. The glow worms or.. caterpillars or whatever they happen to be are really freaky.I recommend this to anyone who likes incomprehensibly insane kid movies laced with freaky animation and weird dubbing. In the suuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuummertime. HELL YES.
5,Good phone.,"I've had this phone for about six months and have had no problems with it. It's a little plain, but if you just want a phone instead of a toy, it's great. Holds charge for about 3 days with normal use (I talk for about an hour to an hour and a half a day).And just in reponse to another reviewer's comments- I've had a similiar experience with Verizon where I was required to purchase a replacement phone (not the A650, this was an older Nokia) when mine broke. Yeah it sucks, but it happens. And I wouldn't really compare the inconvenience of buying a new phone to being imprisoned. And for the record, I beleive most Iraqi POWs are held in Iraqi prison facilities, not at Guantanamo Bay. You're probably thinking of terror suspects, as THEY are held at Gitmo. That's understandable though- you're definitely not the only American to confuse al Qaeda and Iraq."
2,Hinges Break Too Easily,"Our familiy owns threee Samsung SCH-a650 phones. So far, two of them have broken in the exact same place: the right hinge material near the antenna. Both occurred soon after the one-year warranty was up.This appears to be the result of weak plasic in this area. With the hinge plasic broken, the phone opens and closes with difficulty. There is no longer a nice snap shut, and it will open too easily. Eventually the phone becomes unservicable and has to be replaced.If you have this phone, I recommend that you treat it more gently than is normally required for this type phone."
1,Don't buy this phone,"I have now had two Samsung A650s. Both have cracked on the exact same side near the indicator light. It has been three months since I paid $50 for a new phone. Now, Verizon is saying that Samsung won't replace the phone since it apparently has water damage. The water damage indicator on the back of the phone must be sensitive to humidity since I never dropped it in the water. So my only options are to either repair it myself or pay $170 for a new phone. I will never get this phone again and I wouldn't have bought it this time around except it was the only one I could get for under $150. By this time, I've almost spent that much, so I might as well have bought a good one to begin with. Don't buy this phone if you can help it. A phone should last longer than 3 months."
1,Bad Model...,"Initially the phone worked fine until 5 months later. Without dropping the phone (which Verizon accused me of) the screen turned black. For $50 I received the same model replacement phone. This 2nd phone gave me problems 6 months later with call reception. I either couldn't hear the caller or the caller was coming in and out. After much complaints to Verizon, they exchanged my phone with another one (same model). Now this 3rd phone is giving me problems also. The reception is fine, but now no one can hear me. My voice comes thorough very low, faint, and with the complaints from my friends that I sound like I'm far away. I have had it with this phone and with verizon. Very poor customer service and handling of this problem. I can't wait for my contract to be up."
1,Avoid!! Pieces break easily exposing sharp edges!,"My four-year-old daughter loved this toy, until she accidently stepped on one of the plastic ice cream cones and it easily broke, exposing dangerously sharp edges."
5,Excellent - highly recommended,"This was my first pregnancy and I found Cathy Louis' DVD to be very enjoyable. I especially liked (and appreciated) that there were modified sessions for each trimester. I always felt much better after a yoga session and could feel the difference if I was not faithful practicing.My one complaint is that the yoga poses and the best way to position and surrender your body are not described in detail, so a basic knowledge of beginner yoga would be helpful.I will certainly be using this DVD in future pregnancies and would highly recommend it to any woman who is looking for a low impact, relaxing way to surrender to your changing body throughout your pregnancy.-Renee"
5,The best pregnancy yoga DVD,"I am currently 39 weeks + 5 days pregnant (nearly there!!). When I was in my first trimester, I bought 4 dvds from the web. Cathy Louise's DVD is, by leaps and bounds, my favourite. I find it relaxing and strengthening and whenever I do it, baby also seems calm and serene. The different work outs were perfect for each trimester and I have to admit to (at first) being a bit sad when I had to move onto the next one. However, as soon as I did, I thought it was more appropriate than the last for where I was and the size of my bump. It's a great way to ensure that you do your pelvic floor exercises and relaxation breathing. Also, seeing a woman carrying twins doing this yoga work out was inspiring and wonderful. I would, and do, recommend it to anyone."
4,Exactly what it looks like,I got exactly what I expected from this purchase. It is a nice simple decorative item.Quality is fine and it looks nice hanging in the garage with the fishing poles.
3,I replaced the original drill (same model),The price was okay. I replaced the original drill because the clutch collar behind the chuck started to bind and finally froze up rendering the drill useless. It's been about a year and a half and this one is starting to bind also.
2,outdated,"I bought this drill because of price and after I used it for some time and compared to my other Dewalt drills I should say this ones is only for light works. As a professional tool its useless because it limited to drilling, chunk design is outdated and motor itself cannot handle heavy loads."
4,Scary Readers Theatre,Great short scripts for young kids to get used to reading out loud and presenting in front of an audience.
4,For Parents (and Grandparents) More Than Kids,"This collection is a treasure trove for anyone who grew up with The Howdy Doody kids' show, or who just enjoys classic, 1940's and '50's TV. The set comes in a nice box and has 40 of the best episodes of the show, as originally aired between 1949-54. The extras include a nice, 32-page booklet of pictures from the show, and some interviews with some of the people involved in the making of the program. There's no question that grandparents and some parents will enjoy this greatly, but there is a question of whether today's kids will get anything out of it. It just doesn't look or sound and act like anything they would have seen before - but maybe that's not a bad thing. I think it will vary with the individual child of today whether they get anything out of it or not, but there's no question that this will make an excellent holiday gift for anyone who grew up watching it."
5,Perfect!,I absolutely love this group. I miss their presence on the music scene today. This is a great compilation CD fulll of their hits from 1983 to 1993 and there is also a song that really makes this CD worth having. It's called New Star! The best song Roland has ever written. That song alone makes this CD worth owning. Go out and buy it. While there's even more than what's on here you get 79 minutes of music! You couldn't ask for more playing time.
5,Got to hear this...,It truly has their best songs ever. Every song in this album is increadible. If your a fan of theirs than you must get this cd.
4,Good,Good selection of songs. I prefer the original versions than remix but it's good overall. I think the price is right
5,Stay Tuned,"Not the most accomplished violinist so I don't know about all these descriptions for sound quality, where to me it is you make a sound, or you don't, unless you include squeaking noises.This is my excursion from steel core strings and I didn't want something that you have to constantly re-tune because I am just not used to having to do that. These work well in that regard, meaning once you get them well stretched out they pretty much stay in tune under not too heavy of usage.I agree with the other reviewer about the G string and I think if anyone wanted to try just buying a single string to mix in with other strings on their violin, that is what I would recommend, the G, it sounds great. I am actually using the E string that is a Dominant because I like it so much I don't feel like changing it out with the new one from this set and will keep it as a back-up in case I break the one I am using."
5,Kitty,"My 3 year old loves this ""kitty"" and carries it with him everywhere. The soft, fine fur has held up well, but after so much abuse it has gotten a little matted. DO NOT wash this cat...the fur gets completely matted. We actually bought the current kitty as a replacement for one just like it that went in the wash."
3,Cleans the air but it's noisy,"I ordered this to use in my new car, which smelled terrible for the first few months. It did make it smell better, but it's so noisy that I stopped using it. I definitely wouldn't use it with anyone in the car if I want to carry on a conversation."
4,Build Your Own Printed Circuit Board,"Good book full of hints on specifically the EAGLE s/w. As with most free s/w the documentation is sparce and criptic that accompanies ite installatio package. Therefore, a good how-to is essential to fully utilizing the application. The book provides both general and specific schematic and PCB skills. It's an essential book and well worth it in time, money, and expertise. Recommended for your technical library!"
1,A cut and paste of eagle manual,"A big portion of this book is literally a cut and paste version of eagle manual and screen snapshots. If you have slightly ECE and chemistry background, you will find this is an almost useless book. I give it one star because this book collected some useful URLs. However, you can always find those links through online search engines. Don't waste your money on it.In addition, the preface of this book contains some inappropriete politics story that ruins a technical title."
4,"Disturbing PVC news, but unfortunately one of the best cups","This was my 22-month-old's first sippy cup. We've tried numerous brands, but this one seems to be one of the best ones in terms on leakage. Other ones will simply leak when put on the side, or when thrown. This one does not leak on the side and only a bit when thrown.However, I was disturbed by a previous rater's PVC warning. I am European and it is true that PVC in children's products was a huge case a few years ago. Many big companies had to pull products such as clothes with print (always try to buy some with stitched decorations rather than big printed ones). It is beyond me why companies are being so treated so lenient here in the US, despite well-documented evidence of harmful substances."
5,Fits like a glove,Very well made and fits like a glove on my Toyota Corolla 2008. Color is darker than in pictures. Extremely comfortable and just perfect grip.
5,Because they really are!,"""Because I'm Awesome"" is a well produced, fabulous album(CD ?). I'f you're into to power pop/punk, then this is the group for you."
5,"The Dollyrots Are ""Awesome!""","The Dollyrots play fun alternative music with an upbeat tempo that can fill even the most cynical with joy. The lead singer/bassist Kelly is amazing, full of spunk and vigor. Their guitarist Luis plays amazing riffs and their drummer Chris Black set a powerful backbeat. Like Gwen Stefani in her early NO DOUBT days, The Dollyrots are a fun band guaranteed to brighten your spirits on a rainy day - Because we're all awesome!"
5,Well written and argued -- A must read!,"I have to say it is one of the best I have read! MacArthur makes very good points against Rossism and his way ofexposing OEC errors is very well written!Great teaching about how Scripture should guide ourinterpretation of nature not vice versa like OEC argue.OEC wouldn't have as much support if it weren't forthese undiscerning Christian leaders like J. Dobson, etc.If this book was written 20 years ago there would not be nearas many OEC'ists and I would not have been duped into going that rout myself in the early years.Get a copy today!"
3,will point you in the right direction to find more info,"impossible to cover every possible variation of m&a but this book gives you a pretty good idea of what the process is about. it is a little heavy on things the buyer should consider and a little too light on the seller's perspective. not enough detail on types of offers (i.e. all stock, cash, owner carry, etc.) nothing on employment agreements or types of compensation agreements. a decent first book."
3,Out of date material makes book less relevant,"While interesting, the material does not reflect changes in the types of businesses that are currently being acquired; tax, accounting and financial reporting changes; new technques for financing transactions, dramatic changes in the anti trust environment, and the emergence of multinational transactions. The discussion of valuation is extremely simplistic. The book was written before the explosion in high tech acquisitions. I do not recall any reference to internet-related businesses and the valuationn challenges they offer. The book is largely focused on evaluating large businesses, and provides little insight into handling small to medium sized businesses. To the author's credit, he does a good job of explaining basic deal concepts."
2,After 5 years of use,"My unit is 5 years old now and it has pretty much become an expensive battery maintainer if it wants to. It won't charge a weak battery anymore. I don't think I would spend that much again on a ""does it all with a brain"" charger/maintainer. I think you would be better off buying a cheap little maintainer or battery tender and leave the charging part to something more low tech. Mine is so smart now, it won't charge anything.Their customer service was good while under warranty though and I commend them for that but in my opinion it's an expensive battery maintainer."
3,I guess it's about time,"Well, I guess after digging deep into the vaults, this was bound to be released at some point. ""By way of the Drum"" is a pretty lackluster effort from the once glorious Funkadelic. What made this album so desireable was its unavailability. I was fortunate enough to come across a low generation copy of this album a few years back. I suppose the most essentail track is the ""Sunshine of your Love"" with vocals. An instrumental version of this track has been available for some time on George Clinton's collection of rarities released sporatically.The album pretty much sucks, due to overproduction and lackluster songwriting, but it is still something of interest to anyone who obsesses over the funkmob's output like I do."
4,Free your mind and your body,"Laura Shanley's Unassisted Childbirth is not a How To manual. These are the stories of one family's experience of birthing their own way. Laura Shanley does not say, Do what I'm doing. She does not set herself up as an expert. She says, Do it your way. Do not allow your mind or your body to be controlled by experts, even Laura Shanley. I read the book. I did not do it her way, but reading her way helped me to find my way. I birthed unassisted. I went through the whole pregnancy unassisted. I was not lucky--I was smart. For Laura Shanley to take an unpopular view, and put herself in public talking about this view, makes her a woman I can admire. This book helped me become a better me."
3,"Read the first part, ignore the rest","This book has some great information on interventions and how they harm the process of natural childbirth. That is very useful. So after reading about medical interventions one would expect to read about unassisted childbirth and how that would work. No such luck. She write about weird psychological stuff, which is interesting but not really why I wanted to read this book. She has some birth stories and then her own story. She is an odd person and when people read her book it's really no wonder they think anyone giving birth unassisted is crazy. I think it would help to have more useful information like what to expect during labor, how to tie the cord etc."
4,A fantastic surprise,"That Gordon Beck is a criminally underrated piano player despite his time with Phil Woods, etc etc is well know. But this album is a surprise nonetheless. The title is certainly offputting. The personnel is very intriguing. The song titles make you cringe. If you haven-t given up then maybe you get to the music and it is truly great. 30 years before Mehldau etc made conversions of pop seem viable, Gordon made this masterpiece. Get it before it disappears again."
2,Not Worth It!,"My 3 yr. old LOVES construction vehicles, but this drum compactor isn't loved like a Rolly from Bob The Builder. It hardly ever gets played with. I don't understand why the high reviews, there isn't much to this over-priced toy. The front/back roller drums spin, the fake steering wheel turns, and it has a pivot point in the middle. No sounds, no compartments to store things, zippo. If it is so realistic, why not allow the engine compartment to be seen!?! I'd be less annoyed if this was a $5 dollar item, but it is more than 3x that. Do your-self a favor and go to a garage sale and get 10+ toys for the price of this boring item."
2,Another lacking Uncanny X-Men entry from Chuck Austen,"With Grant Morrison's prolific run on New X-Men nothing more than a memory, this TPB takes place after the cataclysmic events in his Planet X and Here Comes Tomorrow arcs (both books you're better off picking up than this). With Magneto dead (yeah right), New York City in ruins, and the mansion in shambles; the X-Men re-group to pick up the pieces. Bright New Mourning manages to bridge the gap between the events of the aforementioned stories and Marvel's recent X-Men:ReLoad event, but the book is hurt badly by some atrocious dialogue and weak storytelling, courtesy of longtime, and long criticized, Uncanny X-Men scribe Chuck Austen. It's only saving grace is the art of Salvador Larroca, which was also the only saving grace of the previous Uncanny X-Men arc, She Lies With Angels. It's worth checking out if you missed these issues, but other than that this is best left on the shelf."
5,Stranger No Rules - from a Central FL fan who was there!,"This is a great CD. I own the original release from the 80s. I live in Central FL and must have see stranger 20 times in local clubs. These guys were fantastic. Ahh...to those who where there...do you remember the Budweiser Pledge that came with each show? Good times. I get this CD out every once in while. Takes me back to great live rock and roll. Back then, every Friday night was another club and another great show. Still loving Stranger after all this time and this CD still rocks."
2,Nothing special,"This product doesn't do much more than water in my eyes, and I expected more from it. I won't buy it again, since the relief it provides is very scarce and brief."
5,everything I need for my small business,"Ordered this phone and the first one came in broked which left me skeptical... was not a huge deal to exchange and the new one works great. I've been looking for a cordless phone, fax, answering machine, was told that it didn't exist, but it does and this is it. I am sooo happy with this phone. Perfect for my work needs in my small boutique."
5,Exactly what I wanted,"Had an old Panasonic for years and years, and when I needed to replace it, it took a long time and Amazon, to find this one. Love that it has everything I need, which includes a CORDLESS phone."
2,Phone's battery doesn't even last a full day,"I bought this item in hopes of replacing my ailing phone/fax unit. The fax part of this item works beautifully but the cordless phone is terrible! The volume on it is so low as to make it almost useless, and there's no way to turn it up. Also, if the phone sits out of its cradle for more than 24 hours, whether in use or not, the battery goes completely dead. This item is now just a fax machine and answering machine."
2,Don't be fooled,"I am a Marillion fan. I am a Marillion collector. I was told Marillion performed on the DVD. I was not told it lasts about a minute. I've made better decisions buying bootlegs than getting duped on this release. In fact. I am a Mott (the Hoople) fan as well, who Angel Air has done quite a few re-releases over the years. Because of this DVD I have refused to purchase anything from this UK company again. I have been trying to unsubscribe from their email..but I keep getting haunted."
3,"Helpful Book, Bad Consulting Service","This book was useful in BEGINNING a search of schools which would provide the education I was seeking via the internet. I had to do lengthy and extensive follow-up/research based on the information provided in this text. One word of caution, an offer is made for ""consulting services"" (for a fee) to assist the reader with their search. I was most dissapointed by this service. The information provided was not individualized based on my responses to their questionnaire and request for further assistance (as was offered) was ignored."
4,"Front Aux Input, Good Reception, CD Player, AND a Low Price","For the last few years, I've been using my portable MP3 player to listen to music in the car. I connected my player to my stereo using one of those tape adapter thingees. This worked well enough, though the tape hiss was a bit annoying.When my factory stereo decided to commit suicide a few months ago by eating the tape adapter, I decided to replace it with an aftermarket unit that had an aux input and be done with the tape hiss nonsense.I used the following criteria to select a stereo:1. Aux input, preferably on the front panel.2. Good FM reception (<= 10 dBf FM sensitivity)3. CD player4. Low price (<= $150)The Aiwa CDC-X504MP met all of these criteria. It may be the only one around that meets all four; there are very few front-panel aux inputs out there."
2,Not up to Prof. Garner's high standard.,"As a great admirer of Prof. Garner's other works, I was very disappointed by this volume. It provides little advice that cannot be found, in equally brief form, in any number of ""general"" writing guides already on the market. I believe lawyers and law students would be better served by buying, first, Garner's *Modern Legal Usage* (a true masterpiece) and reading the essays on general stylistic topics in that excellent volume. If one has additional money and time, Garner's ""Winning Brief"" would be a wise second purchase. [Note: This review, originally written several years ago, was of the first edition of Prof. Garner's *Elements.* The second edition appears to be much improved over the first.]"
3,"easier than SAT review workbook, good ""warm up""",I am using this book to help prepare an adult for the GED. It works well as an easier exercise book.
2,Much better fuzzy logic books are out there.,"With the exception of Ch. 1, the first part of the book is o.k. To see my problem with chapter 1, simply look at the article on bounded rationality he uses in his discussion of a chess game. First, several parts of the article are coppied word for word directly in his text; I have no problem with this, but they should appear in quotes. Second, I don't think his analysis of the article is accurate.Ross does an excellent job of introducing binary logic and extending the results to fuzzy logic. However, other than this one chapter, the rest of the rest of the book is not worth the read. A much better book is by Yager and Filev. I went with Ross' text because it was published in 2004 (you know, latest is greatest) compared to the 1995 publishing of Yager's book. Don't make the same mistake, just get Yager's book; you will learn more and save yourself some money!"
3,My Families Response to Gripper,"Definately not the best gripper around. Grippers issued by hospital much better, even though little shorter. The difference in length is not worth the difference in trigger strength, trigger response speed, etc. The long magnet on the top end is way too long. With the shorter one from the hospital, I am able to use that as a shoe horn in a pinch although it might take a while to make it work correctly.If I had known these things in the beginning, I would not have purchased this gripper. In fact both my mother and I wanted to send it back. My husband was the one who said ""keep it for an emergency"". Looks like that's what we're gonna do although it will be rarely used.Think twice before purchasing please."
3,Works well; could be sturdier,"I can pick up even the tiniest things (like small post earrings) with this reacher. It works well. The only real complaint I have is that it is not durable, contrary to the name. I am on my second one, and can tell you it would not last 6 months under daily use."
1,"Not sturdy, magnet will not even pick up five keys","I got this because of the length, but it has not worked well. The claw had one string to close it and the magnet is too weak to pick up my key ring with five keys. I have a shorter Sammons Preston version with a double string on the claw for a better grip. I am sorry to say I cannot recommend this product, from this manufacturer."
1,Absolute Junk,"Is there any rating lower than one star? This reacher looks like the one used in my hip replacement class, but it is useless. It's very cheaply made. The lower ""jaw"" does not line up with the upper ""jaw"" or gets knocked out of alignment with even the lightest use. The grip is so weak, it won't pick up anything. If it did, it would probably break. I bought one of each length. They went straight into the trash. Don't waste your money."
4,best reacher I have had but still room for improvement,I have purchased 4 different reachers in the past 8 months and this one seems to be the best so far. My gopher was good but like most the suction cups fell off. My pik stik took to much effort to squeeze the handle. The 3rd one fell apart the 1st time I squeezed the handle.This one has many pro's and few cons.pros:lightweightnot much hand strength needed to operatemagnet on front endrubber teeth in gripperraised screw on the front can be used as hookcons:handle is a little small for big handstrigger is small
1,Another near useless reacher,"If picking up small nuts, bolts, and screws with the magnet, andsocks I guess this has a use. The construction is poor. The shaftis very flimsy, u channel aluminum that bent when the pop rivetsthat hold everything together were installed, making the clawoff center so that the ends didn't meet. Some adjustment witha pair of pliers and now they line up but any thing weighing morethan an ounce will pull the jaws back out of alignment and the item will be dropped. The jaws don't even open wide enough to pick up a can of food.I would not recommend this."
2,Reacher Aid,"I have purchased several reachers in an attempt to find one that is capable of fastening the velcro closure of my shoes. This reacher seems to be poorly made, the jaw slips off to the side and is no help at all for the purchase purpose. It is adequate in picking up small objects and clothes etc off the floor when you cannot bend over to get them. The magnet is there if you drop a pin or some other small metal object."
4,Basic small biz backup that does the job,"Works reasonably well to backup my small biz server and my desktops. Installed easily on the server and was easy to configure the clients for remote backup. The wizards help you step through creating backup schedules. None the less, ths is a bit complex so unless you have done tihs before, some experimentation will be needed.A nice option is ""Open File Backup"" which is not included - $1000 extra. This enables backing up of files that are in use (like your open email folders or word documents). This is a valuable feature but the price seems prohibitive."
4,More info,"This watch looks owesome but I think would be helpful to know if the band is adjustable. If so, I rate this item with 5 stars."
1,Adolescent Behavior: A Dull Read,This book is definitely a boring read. Elizabeth Aries uses what others have found instead of making her own conclusions.
4,Risky Love,"Look at Me is uninhibited, robust, and very wide-open. Lauren Porosoff Mitchell is a master at teasing a phrase, capturing a mood, and orchestrating the sensual leading to the psychological. Dana's compulsive adventure -- a back-and-forth romp through the real and the virtual -- is seductive yet distant, bold yet timid, and flirtatious to the point of personal danger. Here is the rational in service of the irrational . . . the science of seduction. And yet here, too, is strength borne of vulnerability . . . the object of desire beckoning the voyeur to ""look at me."" It is into that beaker that the author pours out her soul and thereby colors her world. Love is a risky experiment. Indeed!"
1,BEWARE!!!,"The one I received in the mail (and pictured) is NOT the Disney version that featured the Andrew Sisters. However, kudos to the company for being good about refunding my money for this."
1,Apologist,I was very disappointed by the book.I wanted an explanation for Israels continuing occupation of Palestinian lands but got only apologistic rhetoric from this obvious pro zionist.Much of his writing I thought quite racist and certainly biased.
1,A very cumbersome and one-sided read,"I purchased Alan Dershowitz's latest book as a result of reading the New York Times Book Review section. His latest, The Case for Israel sounded intriguing, and, as almost an exclusive hardcover reader, purchased the book. Sadly, I was disappointed. Although I found the book well-researched, it is very repetitive, almost hammer on your head repetition. It is exclusively one-sided, and does not read smoothly at all. I found the book exceptionally boring, and had to abort reading it in its entirety around page 130. Less heavy-handedness, more two-sided cogent arguments with multiple perspectives would have made a better case for Israel than this read."
4,I'm buying this tonite,"I wanted to read this book because of the recent story of Kasim, a young man from England raised to be an anti-Semitic Muslim, who became an Israel supporter after reading it.so I came to amazon to read the reviews, unsure if I wanted to buy it. but after reading some of the ill-informed and vile responses, explaining patiently how bigoted Dershowitz was and how come we didn't read more Norman Finkelstein (g-d save us), I HAD TO BUY IT IMMEDIATELY.I know from Dershowitz' previous books that he's an outstanding writer. and now I also know that he doesn't let political correctness get in the way of how he feels about Israel. if so many Jew-haters dislike this book, it's GOT to be good. getting my credit card now..."
1,If Israel Truly Wanted Peace They Wouldn't Be Expanding In The West Bank,"My question is when in the History of Mankind have you known Colonialism not to produce insurgent Violence ? The canard that ""Israel is the only Democracy in the Middle East thus deserves special Treatment"" fails for the simple fact that it DOESN'T act like a traditional Democracy like say Canada or Great Britain in regards to Human Right's Violations and more Like Burma's Military Junta. Collective Punishment is not Justified Morally, Legally or Religiously. American Jew's and for that matter Christian Zionist's are more Right Wing than actual Israeli's that live in Israel who actively and without Media silence question the actions of the Israeli Government. Norman Finkelstein has demolished Dershowitz more times than I can count and If you want an even handed approach to the Case against Right Wing Extremist Israeli Policies I suggestThe Israel Lobby and U.S. Foreign Policy"
4,A little bit country....a lot a bit soul!,"All of the songs on this album flow freely from one to the next! I loved the combination,and the southern recording artists can't be beat!"
3,A book that's past its time,"Back in the day, I used to get the SI Almanac every year for Christmas. It was great for settling late night sports arguments with my friends in college. With the advent of the web, however, it's pretty useless. You can get up-to-date stats for all of the sports covered in this almanac online. The articles are a good read, but they meat of this book - namely the stats - can be found for free online.Anyone want to buy my copies of previous editions?"
2,Lacked info,There was no description as to its size! I probabbly would have bought many more if they indacted it's size.
5,Excellent book! Just the right amount of mystery/romance,Debra White Smith is one of my favorite authors! I stumbled across her books in the library and immediately fell in love with the Seven Sisters stories! I have read Best Friends (the pre-series book) as well as books 1-4 of the Seven Sisters series. I highly recommend this author and these books! I don't know how I'm going to wait 4 months for the next book to come out!
2,Kinda Disappointed...,"If you are going to lay out $500 for a camera, you should expect a fair amount of camera.However, I have a few gripes here. First, there is no remote control for it which makes setting up a shot tough. All the Nikons in the D series can use a wireless remote. You can buy an underwater case for those magnificent Nikons so you can shoot underwater. You can get over 10 megapixels in a D80, or D200 and you get that great Nikkor lens. You don't get much of a lens on the DC500, and 5 megapixels don't get you very far when it comes to printing and publication quality images. Lets face it: this is an expensive point-n-shoot camera for a tourist, not a serious camera.Nuff said.-J"
4,Winner of the Koret Award for Best Fiction 1999,This book is the recipient of the Koret Foundation and National Foundation for Jewish Culture Book Award for Best Jewish Fiction Book of 1999
5,AWESOME BOOK,"This is a great book for any follower of Christ. Really gives some good words, and traits that can be used by ANY leader!"
3,When I know you'll know,Using this book as a text for a class. Have not read it yet. I can tell you how good or bad it is when I get a chance to read it. Sorry for not being much help
2,poor quality,"For the price of the mats, I expected better quality. The front seat mats at least have the gripper nubs on the bottom. The ones for the back seat, look like a cheap piece of flimsy rubber without the gripper nubs on the bottom. VERY DISSATISFIED!"
2,The book fails to live up to its title,"This book is disappointing for someone looking for an objective discussion on Biblical verse and the environment. While I believe there is a Biblical basis for environmental stewardship, this book fails to make the case. Hopefully Van Dyke has done a better job in more recent writings."
4,"Not a Tree-Hugger Type of Book, Thankfully",My daughter - in college - thinks this book is quite useful. Glad she does - as the professor gave her little choice about it as her textbook.
1,never owned it but if you want me to review,it looks nice. I like my milwaukee 'sawzall' though. the original
5,Yes!,"Excellent! Very blunt, well put, and provides the information in a way that is no nonsense, straight way. Loved it."
5,"Owned for a few years, will never buy one again","This is the only pad I will ever use! I can't even describe it!One thing, it's kind of hard to keep clean, but no matter how dirty it gets, the performance is the same, breathtaking, and you can just wipe it off to clean it."
1,Confusing and Boring!,"I have been a big fan of Peter Robinson for many years. I've loved most of his early works, so I was looking forward to this book with great anticipation. Unfortunately, after 150 pages, I quit reading it. The main thing wrong with this book, in my mind, was the flipping back and forth every few pages from 1969 to the present. Just when I was interested in the mystery at hand, it stopped for the time being and went to another mystery and another time period. So, I'd have to readjust my thinking and concentration to try to remember what was going on. After while this was just plain boring, and I didn't care anymore. Thus, I slammed it shut and took it back to the library. Nevada Barr in the book FLASHBACK used this approach with much better results. She would write about two different time periods in alternating chapters, but it worked for me brilliantly. This one did not. I won't give up on Robinson, I'll just hope for better luck next time."
1,Disappointed...,"...too rambling, too predictable, too thin in spots. Better books out there in the rock and roll world."
2,margianal,"I read that it was too sensitive, but I was too cheap to pay for the wave2....sigh. Yeah, it is."
1,you get what you pay for,"Received yesterday. put through one sheet, worked perfect. then put through 2 sheets. jammed. now it will not work at all. lasted all of 3 minutes. DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT. It is true to the saying "" you get what you pay for"". spend a little more for a product that will work. the only good thing I can say about this product is it looks nice."
3,well...,"This shredder gets stuck quite often, but is fine for me as I am only using it for junk mail mostly. Although picking the stuck paper out is a little zen like...I have had it for maybe a year and a half and is still working away. With shredders you get what you pay for."
4,Paper Shredder,"The Aurora Paper Shredder works great for personal shredding. I would recommend it to anyone who wants a simple shredder for shredding up bills, receipts, or any other personal information."
2,Low End,The strips are cut too wide on this shredder. It works fine for the money but you get what you pay for.
1,Absolutely terrible product,"I purchased this item as I had Aurora 6 sheet shredder before for 3 years and I was satisfied with its performance over these years. The Aurora changed the design of this shredder to the point that it actually does not perform. After couple of sheets of regular paper the shredder jammed and it took me half an hour to remove pieces of paper from it. Then it happen again in the next 10 minutes, so I cleaned it again,spending another halp an hour or so. When it jammed for the 3rd time, I decided-that is it... and returned it back.I found it to be of very poor quality"
5,Very Happy,The item came quickly. I have used it over 50 times so far and I am very happy with the results.
2,wedding disaster,"I intended to use these jeweled cases to hold the cd of love songs my soon-to-be husband and I were giving away as wedding favors. I am very disappointed to open this box a week and a half before my wedding to find 38 of the 100 cases in this shipment broken and unusable. This would have been a great deal if I didn't have to go out and buy more cases. I thought a few of them may be imperfect, but this was ridiculous"
4,not bad,"the book came in a timely manner however, it was a different cover and edition than pictured which was a little frustrated since that was not mentioned in the sellers description of the item."
3,not bad...,"As a Senior in highschool, I selected this book as an outside reading material. To my surprise, apart from the boring sections of this book there was actually some really good things. Stories and tales fill the book as Archilde learns to live with the father he despises and learn from his mother, whom he rarely understands. Overall, this book gets 2 thumbs up, and they'll probably be black by the time you're through with this book."
1,Cheezy don't last erasers like the good Ole Days.,"They are so thin and not sturdy enough to place on a pensil, the top part is fine but the base that goes around pensil is way too thin.. What happened to the good ole days when they lasted longer than the pensils. If you put any slight pressure to erase with these erasers they split and forget about how you try to wind gumbands around it, it falls off and most of time breaks off since they are so thin. I'd rather pay $l.00 for one if it would last. Come on guys show some effort if you are going to make a product make a product you can be proud of."
4,long lasting,i got them for my daughter for school this year. they look thin on the bottom but they hold up just fine. they last a long time do to the quantity. very good and reliable. i recomend to all who go through earsers fast and need to save money.
2,Fair,"The size and canvas of this product are good. However, the leather breaks down easily and begins to look very rugged after a short period. I used to carry it around with me and now it is only used for the beach where I do not care what happens to it. I wouldn't recommend it you are looking for something more than a throw around bag that you are not expecting to look new for long."
3,Thank you for de-virginizing me.,"Yikes! It's nice to see a behind the curtain look at Hollywood. At the same time, the lyrics to the songs didn't seem funny they seemed more the writing found on the walls in public bathrooms. Honest perhaps, but lacking that depth that takes one a step beyond the toilet. This is at least a triple flusher."
2,Did not recieve two movie disc as stated,"The disc cover says it includes a blue-ray and digital copy, I did receive the blue-ray disc however the other disc that was supposed to be a digital disc copy was a bonus movie disc and did not contain the actual movie. Plan on reporting to amazon."
4,A Laugh-Out-Loud Classic!,"I thoroughly enjoyed this film so much that I nearly died laughing. I wouldn't approve of the drugs or the racist music video at the beginning of the film, but I could not stop laughing when I saw the obese guy being injected with adrenaline and going insane across the villa. Also there was too much foul language and I think t would be more enjoyable with fewer swear words. Other than these irregularities, this was a film that made my stomach explode from laughing so hard.The Young Guardians and the Genesis Spell"
4,Hangover on Acid,"This film is reckless. I loved the pace and the direction. Both characters are likable and not cheesy or boring. The film about as loud and rock and roll as they come, there is absolutely no indie element to it.ps - I love Indie films but Greek is truly an outstanding film which I thoroughly enjoyed."
2,editing is your friend,"This movie is twice as long and half as funny as it should be. Russell Brand's talents are wasted -- except in the rock 'n roll concert footage, so hold out for that. Hey, Apatow! Editing is your friend."
3,Underwhelming,"Forgetting Sarah Marshall was a reasonably funny movie. I'm glad I checked it out from the library instead of seeing it in the theater or renting it. I would have felt sort of sour towards it. Get Him to the Greek was slightly less funny than Forgetting Sarah Marshall, which is odd because the funniest part of Forgetting Sarah Marshall was Russell Brand as rocker Aldous Snow. Logically, it should have been funnier. Things don't always work out like that. Jonah Hill's bland, poorly drawn character did not make me want to engage with the film. Russell Brand's Aldous was not half as eccentric as he could have been. Puff Daddy was surprisingly funny and managed to steal scenes from both Hill and Brand, who could have done better. Don't shell out for this."
4,Don't listen to the reviews!,"This was a really good movie! Was it better than Forgetting Sarah Marshall? No, but not too many movies are. Was it a really funny movie with an AMAZING soundtrack? YES! One person who reviewed this claimed he was a big fan of Family Guy and that is just mindless nonsense. If you want a good film with REAL humor and great music, check it out!"
5,Not what I thought it would be!,"I put off watching this movie because I thought it would be some stupid movie about getting this rock star to a college frat party(I didn't pay attention to the previews when they were out). Finally watched it and I LOVED it! It has great one liners like The Big Lebowski,Spaceballs and Caddyshack. Digital copy is great--dropped it on to my i touch to watch when I am waiting around."
5,Great Movie,I had seen this movie dozens of times before I bought it. I just wanted to be able to watch it whenever i wanted and to see the special features. It is super funny and Jonah Hill and Russel Brand do excellet jobs.
3,The president was captured by russian spys! Ninjas to the rescue!,Definatly much better than the scourge with only 2 spiked balls.Pefect for getting rid of those pesky ninja turtles.
5,It gets the dirty jobs done.,"Being on the move constantly, I like to have the right bags for the Job. I recently purchased the Jumbo bag and I was VERY pleased with it's capacity and strength. I had some ""cargo"" measuring 5'11"", and weighing 170lbs, I had ""no trouble fitting it in the bag"" - if you catch my drift. The sturdy handles held up under the weight and the heavy duty zipper did not bind up on hair or clothing. Since this job went so smoothly, I'm sure I will be coming back for many more Jumbo duffle Bags in the days to come - although, I would recommend a black bag if your ""Cargo"" might have some ""seepage."""
5,An Enjoyable Comic,"When reviewing something, I believe it is important to review both the manufacturing quality of the product and the artistic merit (I use this term very loosely because, of course, it is unfair to compare all products to Renaissance masterpieces).Runaways is manufactured quite well; the product is sturdy, the cover has a nice, glossy finish, and the pages are all of very high quality.Artistically, the comic is very nice. I enjoyed the volume much, and will be buying more of this series. Other review probably review the material much better than myself, so I will merely say that the comic is accessible to all age groups. It will not be a waste of time by any means if you buy and read this comic."
2,"May appeal to the younger set, but not interesting to an Adult","Maybe I'm a crusty old guy even though I'm only in my mid 30's and I'm not the target audience for this book. I picked it up, because I love Y the Last Man. This book didn't do anything for me. The writing and plot (though innovative) is simple and straightforward. The artwork was good, but even that seemed to reaching for the younger crowd (Dragonball Z influence?). I just want to warn Y fans that the writing in this book isn't skewed toward adults and does seem skewed toward disaffected youth. If I could jump back to 13 (and oh man I would love to!) I might dig this book, but this book isn't for those over 20."
3,"Great book, Terrible Binding","5 Stars for content, but there seems to be faulty binding (as others have mentioned). I had to send back my first one because I literally opened the book and a few pages fell out. The second copy seems alright, but the cover still is a bit separated from the book"
1,An embarrassment to dog lovers,"I usually finish every book I begin, whether I like it or not. Not the case with Elisabeth Rose's condescending memoir. While dog owners don't always know exactly what is best, Rose should have had the sense to avoid controversial training techniques (especially since she proclaims to have a deeper connection with animals than most people). Additionally, Rose proclaimed that her dog had the ability to understand complex sentences and her invented sign language. Even the smartest breeds of dogs function mentally at a 2-year-old level, meaning they couldn't comprehend these complex forms of language. After she avoided putting down her suffering dog because she thought she knew better than the vets, I had to stop reading. Clearly, Rose the dog whisperer is above the rest of us mortals--or she was just making things up."
5,used by this reading specialist,"I'm a children's reading specialist and author (""Teaching Kids To Read for Dummies""). I've reviewed dozens of workbooks but use only a handful of the best. Nancy Hall's workbooks are among my favorites because they make absolute good sense. I could go into a lot of technical hoopla about the systematic and progressive teaching of ""phonemic awareness"", but really, this is what it boils down to: Nancy Hall knows her stuff and presents it in an easy to follow, attractive way with plenty of repetition and reinforcement. Great books."
3,Could clearly be better!,"Zophy has put together in one volume the essence of two earlier volumes, and unfortunately omits imporant information in doing so. He is fairly clear, and does well in treating the main issues and people of the era, but omits many important people (like Savonarola). Also, the index has a lot of false references! Nevertheless, it is a handy a helpful guide to this historical era; the chronological charts at the end of each chapter are very helpful."
2,Thank god I won the lottery last year (ha ha),"I'm trying to decide on which $100,000 speaker pair to buy recommended by the magazine. Yes you can sometimes get two (2) speakers for that price. Maybe I will match it with the $150,000 turntable and the $80,000 (each) monoblock amplifiers also recommended. If only I had money left over for the $10,000 interconnects and the $1000 per foot speaker cable. No money left over for records to buy though, darn. Too bad I am now an audiophile and have to buy this stuff and live on the street, homeless, with no car or electricity. If this scenario sounds familiar, you are probably also a poor subscriber to this most ridiculous ""hobby"" magazine as they like to call it.Not advised for children or anybody who doesn't give Mitt Romney major bucks."
2,Psuedo Science,"I used to read this regularly, but then there was a review for a very expensive turntable. The reviewer made a recording of a vinyl LP onto a CD and then compared that CD with the comercially released CD. His comments were that the CD he recorded from the record sounded better than the commercially available CD.Assuming that the record and CD came from the same master, then the only difference the reviewer was hearing was distortion. I could swallow an argument that maybe an LP sounds better than a CD, (I don't really think that, but just for the sake of argument), but then, how could it still sound better than a CD once it's been converted to a CD.This article caused me to loose all faith in the integrity and logic of this magazine."
2,Snobbery,"I love audio, but we have all met audio snobs. Well they all work for this magazine. You can either read this or get it free from the salesmen at the place that sells 80 pound amplifiers."
3,Hey Diners,"Good read, reminds me of the TV series 'Alice', these are some long ago, lifetime waitresses. Who have waited on and been abused by diners for years! Read this and maybe you will see yourself and how you act & look when going out to eat. Sometimes just handing someone a menu seems to change their personality to 'villian on attack' and they are certain you handed them a weapon (with words to beat you with)! and it goes on no matter what part of the country you are in."
5,A Grave Denied,"I love the Kate Shugak novels, and this is one of my favorites, just finished reading for a second time. I really like this one as it was a bit longer than some, it really had the length for a great story development, some feel a little too short. I would recommend it. I am ready for a new one in 2013!"
4,Boomerang Heist,"Charlie Sheldon's ""Boomerang Heist"" is an exciting tale which combines container shipping, the Port of Seattle and its operations, national and local politics, a container decorated by Seattle schoolchildren, and kidnapping and piracy at sea with the threat of international terrorism. The characters are real as are the desperate situations that arize. The author is able to describe various events in detail because of his experience as a deep-sea fisherman, his previous work for the New York and New Jersey Port Authority, and his present position as a Projector Director for the Seattle Port Authority. This book will keep your interest until the end."
5,Perfect movie,This keeps my 4 year old watching over and over. She loves these dolls and I can get stuff done around the house while she plays and this is on. Finally a movie that keeps her siting more than 3 min!
2,Dry leather,"Have similar belt in another color. The leather on the new belt appears dry. Still usable but does not look ""new""."
1,Has no substance,"I am a chiropractor. Chiropractic First has no substance what so ever. Sure, I like to get the word out on chiropractic, but not at the expense of simplistic and dangerous bits of disjointed information that lumps the disease theory into a simple subluxation. If you must read it, get a free copy somewhere."
2,Basic thoughts already captured by others,"I do not know what the other readers are crowing about. The ideas in this book are a repacking of ideas widely disseminated in the CV field. If you have already been exposed to the basic strategies of CV, don't waste your time with this book."
5,"Wry, observant, and wise.","Coe's poems show how strawberries, barefeet, wind, barbecure or the blues can wipe out for a while the grimmer realities of modern life. In that way, even the longer poems feel like haikus: they set up a scene such as guys pulling down a slate roof or a crazy bothering you on the bus, and then wipe it out with humor or sensuous pleasure or music or an understanding that a person can change and grow. Coe's musical background gives rhythm to his poems about Ella Fitzgerald, James Brown or Charlie Mingus. And his two poems on women in the process of freeing themselves from oppressive relationships are remarkable -- and touching."
4,"Dynamic, original, wonderful","If you're just discovering Stephan Micus, start with ""The Garden of Mirrors"" or ""The Music of Stones"". You'll get hooked. I'm not a professional musician so I can't tell you how he makes this music - just that it is as original and haunting as anything out there and I find myself listening at the end of the day."
4,Looks good,"This is a nice set, not high-quality but definitely wearable. The material is softer than I expected and pretty flattering. I'm sure it won't last long, but it is worth the money. I found the garters to be too long, and they're not adjustable, so i had to shorten them with a few stitches. Overall, I'm satisfied."
3,A sci-tech adventure loosely based on recent events,"I enjoyed the fast plot develoment, which made the book easy to get into and the male characters were well-rounded and believable. Having the recent events surrounding the supercollider project as a catalyst for the plot made the novel seem even more plausable. Thats what I really liked about the book. I wish that the antagonist and the female lead had been more fully developed - they just didn't seem to match. I also appreciated the fact that the author told this adventure story without the transcendental sermonizing that I've found in other SF works."
5,"Dunno why, but I love this book","A really fun book, one of those I go back to 3-4 times a year, if you can believe it. Something about the idea that somewhere there are three people with the ability to read and write genetic code who will take care of all the B.S. in the world and also protect us from the Hive makes me feel warm inside. The characters are not the most lifelike, but the science is, as promised, ""hard"" and it's a fun book. It's definitely a book you will enjoy."
4,excellent twist,"Cramer takes what would be a worthwhile, but, not particularly original disaster book (that he, to his credit pokes fun at) and twists the second half into a delightful telling of our history with a terrible inside joke. I was about to give up when this twist captured my interest and swept me through. I will agree with others that the ending was not satisfying. I appreciate the use of cycles, but, we deserve a bit more. Overall, you shouldn't miss this one."
3,a light switch?,"On a whole I enjoyed Einstein's Bridge. It did have a tendency to over explain things... a hazard of the genre I suppose. Somehow I just kept picturing someone explaining how a light switch works every time they walked into a new room. :) Regardless, it kept me interested and turning pages, hallmarks of a good read."
1,Yuraq Janka : Guide to the Peruvian Andes,"The book is a good research of all routes and it offers a nice historic review of the climbs. However, as a guidebook is useless. The author admits that only brief descriptions of the routes are given since he wants to preserve the nature of Andean mountaineering. This, in my opinion, is the wrong perpective of what a guide book should be. I can go to Peru and ask around and get the same brief description at no cost and bear the same risk of getting lost."
5,an important missing link,"If there is an heir to Chapelle's ""History of the American Sailing Navy,"" it is this book. The format is somewhat similar, but with the inclusion of photos in addition to plans. This book picks up where Chapelle left off, with the early steam ships of the US Navy. These are the ships of fame of the Civil War, on which little good information is avaliable. The steam frigates are covered in detail, as well as the sea going sloops and gunboats. The section on the USS Michigan does not do her justice, nor is there a lot information on the engines of the period, but this book is an important missing link in US warship design history from the USS Constellation to the steel hulled ships of the Great White Fleet. Well worth the purchase price to a person interested in period naval archecture, as is VOL II, The Ironclads, and his book on Revenue Cutters."
1,Hard lesson learned,"While the product does say that you can use it on factory finished hardwood floors, I found out the hard way that this product ruined my floor. The product was not on my floor for more than 24 hours and after peeling it up I noticed that the clear coat finish on my hardwoods has come off. Now I need to get a flooring guy in to look at the floors and refinish them since there are patches of missing clear coat everywhere.If you're going to use this product, I would suggest testing a small area first and pulling it up to see what happens."
1,Does not work,"controls do not work on the one I received. After only a few shots with the normal camera controls, the camera loses power.This unit is apparently defective. QED"
4,Canada-based,"I used this book as a text for one of my Emergency Management classes. It is easy to read and understand, and seems to cover the basics well. My only complaints were that it was Canadian-based and it was outdated - missing important information on NIMS, etc. I do recommend it though, as a good checklist when creating an emergency plan."
1,Great TV.......at first,"I ordered the 52HM95 in 2005 and at first, I thought it was the best. The picture on it was the best I have seen. However, in the first year, the lamp burned out, fortunately, it was still under warranty and was replaced without cost to us. The remote has a distinct hum to in whenever it is lit(whenever a button is pushed). We recently noticed discolorization on the left hand of the screen, which looks distinctly like a magnet is too close to the screen. Since It is a freestanding television with no magnets or speakers anywhere near it, I can only assume it is due to the internal speakers of the television. Toshiba will do nothing about it since it is out of warranty. I would warn anyone to stay away from Toshiba televisions and look elsewhere."
2,can crusher,"The can crusher works ok, if you are not careful you will pinch your fingers. It started to squeak after about 20 cans so I sprayed it with WD 40. It works alot better if you mount it to a piece of wood. It's kind of over priced."
5,Solving a problem,"Arrived promptly, as described fixed the problem being encountered. Good experience would gladly purchase from this vendor again. Good Vendor."
3,Useless unless you know a lot about electronics,"I found that unless you've taken courses in basic electronics (transistors, diodes, amplifiers) which is basically 3rd year undergrad EE classes, you won't understand the book as easily.It has sample circuits in the back and covers some fundamental steps to creating an amplifier (making your own PCBs) but I find that the author assumes too much (you already know a lot about electronics and non-linear circuits)."
3,Was hoping it would be more user friendly,"I bought this hoping to blueprint and build my first tube amp, but it seems aimed at electricians more than regular joes. Good for those who can read the language though."
1,Don't Bands have to Know how to Sing?,"Stereobabble is a local New Orleans band. I've listened to all the tracks on this, their debut album, and aside from one catchy tune ""Upside Down"" this album was a disappointment. The lead singer, Scott Frilot, can't sing, nor can the other two members sing backup. Their instrument playing is mediocre and summons memories of a pre-pubescent garage band, and I use the word band loosely, that lived across the street from me in my youth. I don't guess this album did well commercially and Stereobabble never plays any bars or clubs in the New Orleans area, which isn't a surprise. I'd guess that a year from now Stereobabble will be non-existent."
4,Blues + Soul = Phenomenal,"I stopped listening to any kind of radio a few years ago, so my exposure to new artists (to me) is via the internet.I was on YouTube watching clips of Sister Rosetta Tharpe (Up Above My Head) and saw a clip of Ruthie Foster doing a cover, needless to say I was intrigued and sought out her music and bought this release.What a treat. Her blues/soul sensibilities are refreshing. I'll be be exploring the rest of her catalog,which I'm sure I'll enjoy."
2,Could be better,"This is ok, but like the other reviewer said, they move too fast. Some of the early lessons are ok, but once they start moving into dialog, it's hard to understand. Also there is really no help for pronunciation, so you're guessing at the words and sounds."
3,Smells horrible!,"After watching the infomercials for weeks I was excited to purchase this formula. I use a fig body lotion from Bath and Body Works and ""thought"" the fragrance would be comparable. Was I ever wrong. I opened the bottle and smelled it, yuck! I actually smelled it again thinking my nose had deceived me. How could they market a shampoo that smells so bad??? Furthermore, how could some of the reviews state it smelled great? I gave it a shot in the shower and my head tingled so much I felt like I had an ice cream headache. I do have to say the cleansing properties of this product are wonderful. My hair was very shiny and soft. If my hair didn't smell like medicated shampoo I would continue to use it. I am gun shy now to try any of the other fragrances."
2,Not the best and I found better elsewhere.,"I was really looking forward to trying the new Wen Fig. I color my hair on a regular basis and needed something that would be gentle to my hair. Given the amount of money one spends on this product, I was hoping for better. The scent is......gross. It smells like a bar of butter with a tinge of fig. Not appealing at all. I am sure the other products smell fantastic but this was bothersome.I did find a comparable product at Sally's Beauty Supply that is 1/4 the cost AND I don't have to pay shipping. So what did I do with my bottle? I gave it to a friend and she doesn't think it's half bad. To each his own."
3,tigergirlNot impressed,"Not impressed with the price,way too much. I did not see any shine in my hair. But I like how quick it is to clean my hair, no need for shampoo.I find you only need to use 20 pumps (if you cleanse 2 x pr. wash, 10 pumps pr. rinse), 10 pumps if you wash every day, and no need to cleanse twice.VERY IMPORTANT,after you apply and comb the conditioner into your hair, add a little bit of water and make a creamy foam, this will clean the hair.Did not work on my daughters hair (mixed hair, black/white). Her hair became REALLY dry."
5,excellent!,"I've used a few different types of WEN shampoo/conditioner and have been pleased with them all. I especially like the FIG for my fine, curly hair. A hair dresser I recently went to said that I should be using a keratin shampoo and a jojoba conditioner because WEN coats hair. I bought both types of products but my hair felt dry and tangled until I put the conditioner on it. Therefore, I went back to using WEN. I don't find that it coats my hair; instead it leaves it less frizzy and full of body. I wish it was less expensive, but if I need hair or skin products, I'll pay to get what works for me."
4,Great for Type 4a hair!,"I purchased this product after months of consideration. The only thing that was holding me back was the price and the amount of pumps that I knew I would have to use. I bought the one bottle and have to say that I am very impressed. I have since gotten rid of my expensive shampoos and will not use anything else. My type 4a natural hair is extremely dry in the winter and using the WEN really helps. Amazon provided fast shipping as always at a reasonable price and with the promotions for fee shipping oftentimes, it pays off."
5,Amazing WEN,Wen Fig Cleansing Conditioner is wonderful! It alwasy leaves my hair silky smooth.I have been using this product for over a year now and my hair seems much healthier!
2,Fig Flattened My Goddess Hair,"I have fine, curly, untreated hair that I wear natural and air-dried, and only occasionally shampoo. Despite my lack of abuse, it dries up, especially at the ends, so I am always looking to quench my hair's thirst. I tried Wen after seeing the infomercial, but the results on my head were greasy and flat, flat, flat. I had no body and felt like I needed a good shampooing.Perhaps fig was an inappropriate choice: based on what I've read, cucumber is best for fine hair and volume. I would try this again, but definitely a different line."
1,Wen Is an Elaborate Scam,"To find information online about this product is almost impossible due to the massive amount of dummy wen marketing sites created to not just sell the product, but to prevent honest reviews from surfacing.Short and to the point; Wen shampoo is basically a diluted conditioner masked with fruit scents. After using the product, I found my hair was flat, lifeless, and darn right oily."
3,Disappointed,I really wanted this product to do what it says. My hair is not clean feeling. My scalp is itchy. It's definately not for me. Prefer Kronos if you want high end. Save your money!!
2,I had high hopes but they weren't achieved.,"Like my title says, I had some high hopes for this product. I saw a commercial for it and have always needed something to tame my frizzy hair. The commercial, of course, said that it was the best thing ever for your hair. I did notice that it seemed to make my hair healthier, but my hair was still very frizzy. Also, after using it a few times, I felt like I had some buildup in my hair. I am still using it half the time because I think that it makes my hair healthier, but I can't deal with all of the buildup that I get from it.Not what I expected."
2,Too greasy...,During my 2nd pregnancy my hair had gotten very dry and it was hard to do anything with it so I thought I would try something to help it out. After seeing the infomercial for Wen I really wanted to try it but without the commitment so I ordered it here. Well I liked the scent but my hair went from dry to super greasy and forget about using a flat iron to style. The cleanser even clogged my drain which was gross to clean out. I was pretty diappointed but was glad I had ordered it here as a one time thing.
1,"NOT WORTH IT, DON'T BELIEVE IT","This is a horrible product I purchased to use on both my daughter and myself. It did no mirracle, and it just made my daughter's beautiful hair look frizzy, lifeless, and flat. Before WEN, her hair was bouncy, curly, shiny, and soft. It's a terrible product that just costs a lot of money. If you want a real product that's worth the price try AVEDA and PUREOLOGY. I went back to my AVEDA, and that saved my hair. I use a children's brand (circle of friends) for my daughter that is sulfate free/tearfree and it works a lot better. So don't give into the hype, these 5star rating people obviously haven't tried anything out there other than drugstore shampoo which will give the same(maybe even better) results as WEN."
1,Not Recommended,I have color treated hair and the texture is somewhat coarse. I have used the product three times now and will return the rest of it for a refund. My hair has gotten very frizzy and I have had alot of breakage. This is the Wen Fig product and I definitely do not recommend it. I have had better results using the Hair One product for color treated and the one for dry hair.
5,Great Product,"I saw this product used on the ""How Do I Look"" program on the Style Network. Although I was skeptical, I was intrigued by the fact that the product was both a cleanser and conditioner. On the program, Chaz Dean said the products will not fade hair color. The first time I used it I was amazed at the texture of my hair and how manageable it was. I have very thick, wavy hair, and even with salon products I usually have a problem with dryness. This product leaves my hair soft without being too weighed-down, and I can't believe how shiny it is. It seems a little pricey at first, but it is well worth the money."
2,Very Disappointed,"If I am spending $28 on a bottle of shampoo, I shouldn't have to wash my hair every day. The day after shampooing, my hair would get dull and greasy and I would have to pull it back. On the day I shampooed, there wasn't a real significant difference between Wen and the Dove shampoo & conditioner that cost $4. Sure, my hair looked good, but not better, and it still required the same amount of styling and straightening. I was looking for something that would make a significant improvement to my thick, frizzy hair without a lot of work, but I definitely didn't find it in Wen. Severely disappointed."
4,been using it for 1 week and so far so good,"I have long (about 20cm past shoulder length), chemically treated (color and a year old digital perm) Asian hair. I would say my hair is on the dry side. I bought the Fig scented one. It seems to be very gentle on my hair and cleans it well. It makes my hair soft and with good volume. I use probably ~20 pumps on my hair and feel that 30+ pumps are not necessary. I do feel that my roots start to become a bit greasy on day 2 after washing. What I dislike about it most is the scent. The ""fig"" smell is a little appalling but I guess it is a personal preference kind of thing. I may try some other fragrant varieties."
1,don't waste your money,"I normally use the Lavender Wen and just felt like a change so I ordered the Fig, thought it would be the same quality but definitely NOT. The Fig Wen left my hair feeling very dry and brittle and it smelled horrible, like something burnt. I was so surprised because I really love the Lavender version and my hair has never looked better."
3,Not for every wash,"I am a man that is really picky and critical about shampoo. I have tried many kinds and many natural types that can be found at health food stores. The first wash my hair was very smooth and soft and I thought, Excellent !The second wash it was just ok but my hair got oily much faster then usual.Then the 3rd wash I rinsed over and over until I thought no trace of Wen.What I found was, my hair was now way too dry.So my conclusion is that to get the best result do not over rinse and if you under rinse you will get oily hair fast.You have to find a perfect balance."
1,Makes your hair fall out,I have been using wen for over 4 months and recently stopped when I could no longer ignore the amount of hair that I was losing in the shower and also randomly throughout the day. I am taking a break to see if my hair grows back. I am no longer a wen girl.
3,oily!,i have really long and thick hair and after seeing the commercials i really wanted to try. i dont think its anything special. i tried and and it would make my hair really oily and greasy (and i haave thick hair!) i had bought once and dont plan on again. i did enjoy the only one step. by its not worth it if it makes your hair really gross and nasty. on the site it recommends using more MORE product if your hair gets oily. i tried and didnt work. just made things worse. good concept not a great product
2,wen shampoo,"Again, I bought this product thinking it would be much different from what I have tried (and I have tried sooo many). I have been searching for a long time now for a cleansing system that not only works well on my hair but tends to my scalp as well. This specific cleanser smelled awful and did not work well to leave my hair feeling moisturized.It did clean well, but I still had scalp problems. It is awful pricey too. I will not try any more wen products for this is the 2nd one I tried."
3,A Bit too thick,"My hair is very thick, corse, and color treated. I had good luck with the Mint Almond and after looking at web-site decided this might be a better fit for me.Close, it is a bit heavy, and hair separtes into sections a day earlier than with the other formula.SInce I live beachside, I do think the extra thickness of the formula might give a bit more protection from the harsh drying air and salt mist.It has only been a week or two, maybe things will settle out, as when first trying Wen--a bit to get used to , but much better in the end."
2,Product did not work like it says.,"I was a little afraid to try this product but I read so many good things about it I decided to try.. I used it exactly as it says to for over 2 weeks. I could hardly wait to wash my with real shampoo & conditioner, while this Fig stuff did in fact smell great, it did nothing for my hair except to make it seem 'gummed' and VERY frizzy. So much that I couldn't brush it without looking like I put my finger in a light socket.to sum up; I think some people may actually be able to use it but not me. It was a waste of money."
2,"Very fast delivery service, but not 'blown away' by product.","I feel I need to share my experience with Wen for customers. I started using Minty Almond 2 months ago, for one month. My scalp had a pimply reaction to it, severe enough to require a steroid lotion from doctor. After healing, I then wrote to Wen and they recommended I use Fig, which I did for another month. I DID NOT have any kind of allergic reaction from that one. But I have to tell you...this product is doing absolutely nothing for my hair type. My hair texture is fine but I have A LOT of hair thickness-wise. It always appears dry, as if having too much body and frizzies. And I thought this product would be so wonderful for my type hair - as advertised. Not so unfortunately and I'm very disappointed. I get more results with a little inexpensive 'safflower oil' in the palm of my hand with my reg. shampoo. So sometimes you have to consider the old phrase...When it sounds too good to be true....then just maybe it is!!"
2,Wen didn't impress me,"I purchased Wen after seeing it advertised on an infomercial. Amazon offered a good price, and it shipped super fast! But the product didn't work for me. I followed the directions for a week, and it made my hair greasey and lifeless. I have thick, curly hair so I chose the fig version as it was recommended for my hair type. The first time I used it my head tingled, but by the second use the sensation was not so intense. I did't really like the scent either. I was hoping it would smell like a fig newton cookie, but honestly the smell was just not very enjoyable. Since the product is expensive, I am now trying to use it up as a follow up conditioner after my regular shampoo, which it work fine as, but defeats the purpose of having to use only one product. For the price, I will switch back to my regular regimen when I empty the bottle. For me, it did not work, and was not worth the price."
2,Regrets,"I love Renee Fleming (her Strauss is impeccable). Bel Canto reminded me of what a superb artist Maria Callas [even Joan Sutherland] was. Bel Canto singing is not a repertoire Renee Fleming should concentrate on. Her breathy Anna Moffo mannerisms are off putting - that is not how you infuse drama into music. Her high notes remind me of Callas because they are so effortful, but the dramatic intelligence and instinctive understanding of the text are just not there when Fleming sings the items on this CD. An A for effort; a C for execution."
5,Great for Preschool Classes!,"I teach a toddler/preschool class and the parachute is a hit. The colors are bright and it's easy to use. So far, there has been no ripping or tearing and believe me, the kids are very active with it!"
1,Poor quality,The paint was extremely thin and was not a true red as the cap shows but more of a maroon color. Very runny and not at all useable for writing any letters or sayings. A huge disappointment.
4,Great Book!,"I read other books by this author and this one was great as well! Recommend reading by owners, supervisors, leadership and those who inspire to be successful."
2,pagan astrology,"I'm only half way through the book but have noticed that approximately one half of the words are incorrectly put under the wrong element. So I give it a two and one half stars. The premise is great, but lets face it, it's pure pagan astrology, Fire, Water, Air and Earth. There is a personality system called WORDTYPES that admits to it's astrological origins that is much better. But I do suggest reading this book as it gives you the basic idea of elemental astrology. Personally, I think that this system is going to change the world."
2,Muscular Liberalism,"Being interested in current events, I was chagrinned to find that this book is almost exclusively a historical review beginning at the start of the Cold War and crawling up to our present day. Having lived through most of this history, I found it not that enlightening, albeit somewhat useful, as it always is to review things long put aside. I found the book boring to read, not compelling like a lot of good historical writing often is, David McCullough's work as an example.Given the Democratic gains from Rham Emanuel's handpicked candidates for the House, Beinart's views seem coincident with the arrival of some of these new representatives, so it will be interesting to see if he's accurately intuited the zeitgeist of the resuscitated Democratic Party, and how effectively it manages to reorient US foreign policy."
1,Perfect case of 'emotional' thinking,"Author makes gigantic case of Bush's not having yet succeeded in his democratization of the Middle East; yet when considering the lack of success in Bosnia resulting from Clinton's work there, his excuse is that 'democratization' takes a great deal of time. Let me see, Clinton's actions of 8 years ago is so recent that we can not yet evaluate it, but we can damn Bush for his actions on the same goal in half that time. These liberals are so full of hate and search for 'right's that their brains have atrophied and they no longer are capalbe of any but emotional thinking. If that's what you'd like to spend your time reading and have also lost your power of rational thought, this is the book for you!"
3,"Pinches, but strong material.","I'm a plus size girl (size 16), and the bands definitely pinch in my thighs.. Also, the high amounts of elastic in the band make them difficult to hook to a garter belt. I got these specifically for the aesthetic purpose of going with a garter belt and find myself having to take them off in the middle of the night because the band is just so uncomfortable. Aside from that, the stocking material itself is pretty strong and I'd call it run-resistant."
5,Awesome reference,"If you are a NASCAR fan and a stat junky, this is the perfect book. With yearly drivers and owners statistics, plus the top five finishers from every race in the Grand National/Winston Cup series, this book has every stat that is important. The only drawback is that it was published in 2003, so the last two years worth of results are not documented. Notwithstanding that blemish, this is a great reference."
2,Have really fallen,"I've been reading PC Gamer since 1999 and they have really fallen in terms of quality. The magazines are practically paper thin now. It has been awhile, but I believe my copy of the issue that previewed Duke Nukem Forever in 1999 may have been over 200 pages worth of content. Now? 80, 90, etc.Instead of being the gritty, hard to please mag they used to be they are essentially ad-magnets now. I've seen multiple games that were widely frowned upon get high scores simply for one reason: they got the ""exclusive"". I can't help but think PC Gamer is in the back pockets of many companies now that they're the ""top"" PC gaming mag around.R.L. Ermey once said on one of their discs that PCG had ""its **** in the bag"", and it once did. Once. The mag still has some wit and charm about it and the hardware section is still quite good... but that's about it."
4,PC Gamer,"I subscribed to this before a couple of years ago and then let my subscription lapse. It's thin but still good, and still sending those great CDs!"
3,"Good points, bad ending","While many comment that books such as these are too repetitive, repitition is in fact necessary to convey a point. Schor conveys her points well without too much repitition. However, she ends the book with some weak suggestions on how to improve conditions. These provide a bad opinionated ending to a book that contains good information."
4,Great book for beginners!,"This c# book will get you off to a great start if you are interested in learning the basics of programming. The book is uniquely written; You're brought into a past programming course that the author taught and you learn how to create the same project that his students did from start to finish. It outlines all of the basic, foundational principles of the C# language and presents them in a way unlike a dry reference book. The shipping from the author was speedy and he even answered a programming question that I emailed to him regarding an example in the book."
5,Forget Hogwarts! I want to go the Miss Clough's school!,"Albus Dumbledore has nothing on Miss Clough. Down a path behind her one-room school house stands a copper gate. And behind that gate lies the experience of a lifetime -- the experience shared by everyone in town on the day they graduate 6th grade -- the experience that shapes you for the rest of your life. There are no muggles here. Everyone who graduates 6th grade can go through that gate and be changed forever. It doesn't matter if you are new to town, or if your family has been there for generations. The author builds up suspense and then delivers. This is practical magic. I loved it!"
4,An Unpredictable Adventure,"This book was one of the shortest we've ever read. Although it lacked the quantity of a masterpiece, it kept our interest because it was unpredictable. The author describes the characters pretty well. The last scene is about graduation experience of five kids who almost worship their teacher. She leads them on an adventure that they will never forget. We especially liked the way the characters' mental states were explained as they go through the change into another reality. The last scene was stunningly brilliant. If you read the book, you'll see our reasoning.Newton Boys Reading Circle"
2,You only get one chock!,"First, the unit is huge! Be sure you look at the dimensions. This is a good thing. However, you get only ONE chock! Yes, only one chock is pictured, but Amazon pics are often misleading and I think it is reasonable to expect you get two chocks. When one jacks up a vehicle/RV, don't you need two chocks behind the other two wheels??"
1,"Expiration date, wrong curve, too slick","Per another reviewer: AN EXPIRATION DATE?!?!? Give me a break. Mine arrived Dec 2012 and they expire Jul 2016, so I at least have 3.5 years to enjoy my purchase. Perhaps the resin gets brittle? Perhaps that's as long as the lawyers wanted to wait for a suit?They are also placarded (and, to be fair, noted in the description) to be used with 29"" tires max. Fine for cars and trailers, not usable for motorhomes which will typically start at 30"" and go up from there. The tight curve of the chock means that the larger tire, even a 30"" or a 31"", hits the TOP of the chock first; and this chock's hard, slick plastic will not grab a surface like concrete or asphalt, so the tire just pushes the chock along.Too bad really, because it's a really beefy chock with a great ergonomic design, allowing you to easily grab it for insertion or extraction. Sad to say, I don't think the basic purpose is functional."
5,Sensible and Informative,"This book is logically broken down into three parts: 1) why exercise is the key to weight loss, 2) how to exercise, and 3) what our bodies need for nourishment to stay fit. The workout pictures are extremely helpful as is the 4-week menu plan implementing Weight Watcher's 1-2-3 Success Point Values plan. This book has become a true companion and guide for me. I would highly recommend it to anyone who is truly interested in losing weight sensibly and keeping it off."
3,it serves its purpose,"I did not understand the reading always, some is understandible for me and some is not. I guess everyone has their ways of expressing information. Yet, it is very informative. If you like me that intense readings with not such a great knowledge of vocabulary, take the reading time in sections and slowing so you can understand it better. Like in many book, you will agree with the author in some things, and other things you will not. Sometimes when a book has too many disagreement/bias with me I put it down, but since this was for Class in John I had no choice but to read it and write papers on. This is just my personal opinion. Yet, in class I found other students that enjoyed the book very much."
1,Appalling Translation of a Masterwork,"On pain of death, I beg you not to save a few bucks by buying this translation of Goethe's masterpiece. This dusty, Victorian--era translation is opaque, humorless, and turgid. I can think of no greater disservice to a great writer. Obviously Dover picked this translation because it is in the public domain, and they did not have to pay for it. This is a great stratagem for holding down consumer costs, but it comes at a high price in terms of enjoyment. The absence of critical apparatus also detracts. There are much better translations available, especially the one from Princeton University Press. That one costs more but is well worth it in the long run. In short, though, you should buy anything BUT this boring miscarriage."
4,Messie Messies Go Away!,Provides a lot of help ideas to help my family get organized. Great starting point!
1,"Mistitled- Should read ""My Tirade Against Animal Righters","If you are looking for fun facts about camels, horses, cats, dogs,etc and their supposed early histories, get another book. The animals themselves are hardly mentioned. This is just one long bitter argument about why he is right and others are wrong. I'm not a supporter of either side in this argument. I wanted an expanded section of the chapter of animal domesticatin in Gun Germs and Steel, but that isnt what I got"
4,A masterful blend of history and fiction,"Kluger does an excellent job depicting the life of actual sheriff of Nottingham Philip Mark. The author took known incidents and worked them into the framework of his story expertly.I was interested in the narrative for every page, a rare occurence in a nearly 500 page novel. I've been entertained and learned about early 13th century England. Keep a dictionary handy. Kluger uses obscure words."
4,"Great Controller, not for Vista, though...","I have had this controller for a few years now. Still works great, I think. Only works for Windows xp and earlier. Not vista compatible, so if you've got vista, better keep looking.Other than that, it works great. :)"
3,No signed drivers,"This item works great, and is exactly as described and seemingly durable enough. My only issue is that Nyko hasn't purchased Verisign, and unsigned drivers don't always work with Windows 7. There is a workaround, but the fact that one is necessary with a brand new item is quite irritating."
4,Finally got it right,"The first book was wonderful the rest were a waste of trees. Wow, she finally hit the target with the last one. I wish she the two main characters spent more time together in the book, but the resolution was satifactory."
5,not shipped...,"You see I rated this season 5 stars bc I'm a true fan, and I've gotten most of my seasons of supernatural from amazon... This time I was really excited to get season 7. I ordered it on the 6th of this month,but it hasn't been shipped yet, and it's the 22nd... but I had the free 2 day shipping special... can anyone help??"
5,As Excellent As Seasons 1-6!,"The Boys continue their great performances, and the writers of this series never seem to fail to find new and interesting twists to put them through. Anyone who love Supernatural will love Season 7!"
5,Love supernatural!!,"This television series will always be my favorite. I love all the cast, and they do an amazing job with the graphics! This season was not my favorite season of the series by far, but I gotta have them all!!"
5,One of my fave eps from S7,"Maybe some don't care for Becky, but I love her- Heck, I am her! LOL! And this is the funniest episodes of Season 7 of my fave show, Supernatural."
4,Good Enough,The show is not how it used to be in the first seasons but there still some good episodes and a plot that you want to watch unravel.
5,Leviathan Sam and Dean,"Sam and Dean are framed by Leviathans for several crimes and end up wanted by the FBI while Bobby attempts to figure out how to kill Leviathans. The whole soapy water business was a bit lame, but otherwise a solid episode. Sam finally finds out about Amy's death at Dean's hands, and as usual walks away from Dean. Leviathan boss Dick Roman meets with the King of Hell, Crowley, and rejects his offer for a partnership. Crowley quickly realizes that the Leviathan's are not opposed to eliminating all demons in addition to the humans."
5,"Slow down, my heart~","This was an awesome episode, the best since the Bobby episodes! Since the other reviewers broke it, Cass does come back. OMG. I missed his smexiness! XD We get crazy Sam and the awesome Lucifer. That cracked me up. It was a good episode!"
3,Not my favorite season,"I got this email asking if this met my expectations, the answer is no but that is not the stores fault, I think they ran out of ideas at the Supernatural writers forum, the show is just not as good as it used to be and there is an awful amount of filler episodes. Do not get me wrong it is still a good show and all, just not what it used to be."
5,Great Show - Great Season - Great Buy,I bought the Supernatural Season 7 for a dear friend. He thanked me every day for two weeks. Thank You very much!
5,Supernatural,DVD set arrived very quickly and in great shape. This series continues to surprise and entertain me and my family.
5,BEST SHOW EVER,I loved this season!! Dean and Sam are amazing as usual and they keep the surprises coming! I love this show!
5,Super Season 7,I have all of the seasons on DVD. I have other shows on when this airs so I wait until the DVDs become available. So I can watch it all at once. I go through a season in about 2 or 3 days. So I hate waiting for one episode each week. I would recommend. Mom watches too.
1,Mally eye lash curler is worst eye lash curler EVER,This is truly the worst eye lash curler I have ever used in my entire life. It does not curl at all. It does the oppposite of curling and actually smashes the lashes inward and down to make them look shorter and awful. I would not use it it for any reason as it made my lashes worse.It is truly a jokeMally may be a marketing wiz and not a cosmetic wiz. I feel ripped off big time
2,Reasons for rating,The only reason that this product was given a two star rating is that after the first few days the brakes seemed to slip and it will move when you sit down. BE CAREFUL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,great product but buyer beware,"This walker arrived on time and was in good shape. However, I bought it for my 92 year old mother and before even assembling it she said she didn't want it because the basket is not located directly under the seat. These folks will not accept returns on walkers at all for any reason."
3,Rollator Walker review,Overall I was pleased with the walker purchase with the improved backrest on the walker compared to the last time I purchased this walker and as shown in the pictue. I was however dissapointed that they changed the brakes on the walker. I was buying this walker because I did not destroy the brakes easily with this brand but the new brakes I will distroy rather quickly.
1,Abysmal,"Abysmal. Brahms composed these sonatas for Violin and Piano, not PIANO and violin. If these performances can be rebalanced, that should be done. If not, sink the whole thing like a stone. I will always wonder what Szeryng's playing would have sounded like, if only it had been audible.-Frank W. Barham"
4,Nice for the money,"Nice high chair fits dolls from 15"" to about 20"" A good buy.Easy to assemble also. Pretty chair for a doll"
4,Synopsis,"The Lady of the Lake is a narrative poem by Sir Walter Scott, first published in 1810. Set in the Trossachs region of Scotland, it is composed of six cantos, each of which concerns the action of a single day.[1] The poem has three main plots: the contest among three men, Roderick Dhu, James Fitz-James, and Malcolm Graeme, to win the love of Ellen Douglas; the feud and reconciliation of King James V of Scotland and James Douglas; and a war between the lowland Scots (led by James V) and the highland clans (led by Roderick Dhu of Clan Alpine). The poem was tremendously influential in the nineteenth century, and inspired the Highland Revival.By the late twentieth century, however, the poem was virtually forgotten. Its influence is indirect: Schubert's Ave Maria, Rossini's La donna del lago (1819), the Ku Klux Klan custom of cross burning, the last name of U.S. abolitionist Frederick Douglass, and the song ""Hail to the Chief"", were all inspired by the poem."
4,"Great, but has a few quirks","I got this camera as a replacement for a 3 year old camera. The two things I really like about this camera are its size (It's not cumbersome to put in a jeans pocket, unlike most cameras), and that it does a very nice job taking pictures in dark places, like bars and nightclubs. This was the area where my previous camera really came up short.The only two critiques I have on the camera is that sometimes, the icons are not very intuitive. I still don't know what many of them are... if there were a way to replace some icons with even abbreviations, that would really help. Also, some feature which I think would be really easy to do are not so intuitive. For example, moving from a high MP mode to a lower one.But overall, this is a great camera. And at this price, I feel like I bought the best blend of size, price, and picture quality."
3,Do not love it,I've had my camera for about a week now and I am not totally sold. It is replacing my Canon SD400 which broke. The new design of the the SD1000 is not nearly as sleek and comfortible as my old one. This is very boxy and the matt like finish on it shows every finger print. I also do not like the zoom switch. They have made it much smaller on this new camera which makes it harder to grab it. I'm returning this camera and thinking about trying the SD750.
4,awesome camera!!,"i've had this camera for about a month and it's pretty great! it's nice and compact and doesn't weigh a lot thus making it easy to carry around. the quality of the pictures are true to the canon name, but my problem would be the quality of pictures in low light. you can pretty much forget about having nice pictures if you're in a room with dim lighting. besides that i'd say this camera is worth the money! i bought mine from amazon but you can also get it now for the same price at best buy!"
3,The pics are fine if the light is fine,"Pros:- Small size- Nice design- Great video quality- Great sound quality- Easy to use- Nice functionsCons:- Red eye reduction simply does not work- Weak flash causes low light pics to be dark and out of focus- Gamma correction is not effective (if there is too much light or too few light, the pics are ruined)- Under normal 'point and shoot' conditions, it does not feel like a real upgrade from my previous Samsung V3 overall"
5,Excellent Camera,"I've had the SD1000 for a couple of years now and have been very satisfied with its performance. Its small size is particularly convenient for vacations. Solidly constructed, good photographic features and easily transfers images to my computer."
1,THIS STAY AT HOME MOM SAYS DON'T BOTHER!,"This is a fabulous camera in the beginning, but I've had it in for repairs 4 TIMES FOR THE SAME THING....Several times it was under warranty, but the average cost to send it into the factory is $109. The lens has the tendancy to get stuck and doesn't work after awhile. It happened the first time during the first year I had it, although I use it a lot with two small kids...I expected for the money for it to last a lot longer. I've asked to have it replaced and they will only ""repair"" it usually with a cost to me! VERY FRUSTRATING! So I would have to say there is something mechanically wrong with it. I do have other family members and friends who have had the same problem. It takes awhile to act up, but then it is past the point on no return."
5,Canon PowerShot SD1000 7.1MP Digital Elph Camera,"This camera fits in a small handbag or pocket. It is very easy to use and when connected to a printer, the pictures viewed on the camera's screen are printed as viewed. A good investment."
3,I expected more from Canon,"The canon powershot is a camera that takes decent pictures. However, I can say that I have been disappointed by some features of the camera:1. Clunky and confusing interface2. No cradle included3. USB cable doesn't charge camera...you have to take battery out and charge separately.4. Poor battery life.I was just disappointed b/c I figured with as long as canon has been making powershots that they would have it down to a science by now...however, there is still work to be done. :("
3,Good camera for a reasonable price,"This camera offers a lot of features, it is small enough but you do not have a feeling that it will just drop from your hand. The issue I have with it - too long time between two shots. Unless I miss some settings, it takes too long for another shot."
1,Great until the lens jams.,I enjoyed this camera until the lens jammed. I tried all the techniques used by other people who had the same problem to no avail. If a tiny grain of sand gets stuck around the lens or if you drop it from a height of 4 inches this camera my not survive.
3,"Cool Features, but Picture Quality is disappointing.","Okay, first the pros. This camera looks super cool, if that's what you're going for. It's tiny and sleek, and the viewfinder is very bright and big, nice package on the outside. Some of the features include the face recognition (cool!), and red-eye reduction. Unfortunately I ended up returning this camera due to the horrible picture quality. I think it is because of the image stabilization or distortion to prevent noise at high iso's, but this camera took pictures that were fuzzier than my 5.0 megapixel Kodak. The images did have vibrant color, but every single one of them was fuzzy and soft, outside or inside, with or without flash. Maybe it's the lense? If you are a stickler for good picture quality and sharp photos, go with something else, even a lower megapixel camera, or wait for an improvement on the SD1000."
4,Can't complain...does what its supposed to,"These days its hard to find technology that simply does what its supposed to. I think this one does it well. Its not an overachieving product. The only reason I give it 4 stars is that I wish there were a few more manual features, but that's about it. For point and shoot digital I can't complain."
4,Nice so far...,"The camera is what I expected as far as taking pictures. I can say that my use is limited compared to some so I want the camera to be intuitive, easy to use, without having to remember a lot things. The menus are not the easiest to navigate. Maybe if you are used to this menu but my last camera was a powershot and I still can't find things that I'm looking for. My only other complaint is that the zoom feature should be much easier to access. Yes, it is in the normal spot on top but it is very flat and difficult to press to the right or left quickly.Besides that, the pictures look very nice and it is very impressive in low light situations... at least in my opinion."
5,Easy to use and good quality photos,This is my third digital camera and by far the most compact and easiest to use of all my previous cameras -- including the point and shoot box cameras of my youth as well as more advanced SLR cameras with interchangeable lenses and the two earlier digital cameras. The instructions are detailed but understandable It actually does fit in a shirt pocket since it is no bigger than a deck of playing cards. I particularly like its battery pack with supplied charger.
5,Wow,"I bought this to replace a Canon A20. Boy have they changed, and for the better. Easy to handle, shoot, charge, export and just the right size. Am wondering about how scratch resistent the lcd display is, but will have to wait and see.So far, the perfect camera for the family."
5,Canon Power Shot SD 1000,"A great little camera, takes great pics , very nice size and easy to travel with. Still learning about all the features."
4,luv the camara,This camara takes awsome pics. The controls are easy to understand and operate. I purchased this for my girlfriend for christmas and she was able to start taking great pics the moment she opened it. The thing she loves the most has to be the zoom. I am truely glad I bought this camara for her.
2,Terrible shutter lag,"There is no sports (action) setting on this camera, so if you plan to take a picture of anything that moves, be it your child's football game or even your pet, forget it. You can expect a 2-3 second delay -- just enough to miss the shot you wanted. It doesn't matter which setting you use. I suppose the camera is fine for pictures of buildings and flowers, but don't you want to fill your albums with more than that?"
4,"good for outdoors, mediocre for indoors.","I loved the outdoor pictures, but the indoor one's left much to be desired. Still, such is expected from an ultracompact point and click camera."
2,Lens Error ( 2nd Canon to do this to me ),"I've had this camera a little over a year. My daughter took it on a trip and the very moment she went to use it the lens barrel got stuck in the open position. My older SD200 also gave a ""E18"" error and stopped functioning. I called a local camera repair. They said it would take 3 weeks and $50-80USD to fix it."
5,BEST CAMERA I EVER OWNED,"I am now looking for a replacement, even though I don't want to. My Canon Powershot SD1000 got stolen from my car :( I like this camera so much I might buy a same one on here."
4,Great Camera,"Have only had this camera for a day, so my knowledge of it is limited. Out of the box this camera takes excellant pictures. It is an easy camera to just point and shoot. The flash doesn't seem to need lots of time to adjust to what your shooting. The battery {included} charged rather quickly and I was off to play. Video w/microphone works great thus far. Saves movies to AVI. While the camera is rather small, it feels solid in hand. My last camera being a POS 3.1 mp, Walmart special. This camera makes me glad to pony up the extra cash for something more ""useable"". For some reason the black model was $20 cheaper. Honestly, I preferred the look of the black model. Low light pictures turn out great. The stability control also seems to work great. I've taken zoomed pictures with great success as well. I'd prefer a camera a to be a little larger, which is the only reason I've rated it a 4 instead of 5."
3,"cute size, bad canon quality","I'd like to say this was a happy camera to be with, but after a few months it petered out with the dreaded 'lens error'. I decided to write a review because i think there has got to be a bug in the price, i bought mine dec 07 and it was 170 bucks brand new. 300+ for this hunk of crap? I have a 450 that has withstood snow, sand, dirt, and rocks for several years with barely a mark. This one wasn't even close to a beach when the lens got stuck and wouldn't retract.. Canon needs to install a force sensing circuit on their bellows claw so that the motor doesn't jump the track when its got a lens obstruction. It wasn't the case on mine, but the it still would help."
2,"Nice pictures, but unable to download pictures to computer","I received the camera and really loved the ease and picture quality. However, when it came time to download the pictures, the software was installed correctly, but the my computer would still not recognize the camera.I spent a lot of time trying to get the pictures to download from my camera, and it still wouldn't work. I finally called customer support and they attempted to trouble shoot my problems...to no avail. It still does not download pictures to MY computer. It will work on other computers, but not mine. They blame my computer, but my USB port works fine.Still frustrated...."
4,"Little expensive here, otherwise great camera",I saw this with one of my friend and liked very much. Wanted to get a good bargain but price here on amazon was not that good.
5,great upgrade,"I have owned a lot of the canon cameras, all have been great buys. last one was the 450, which was a nice camera, but this is an amazing upgrade, all the features the 450 needed, much better double zoom, color saturation is great, still some trouble with low light, but the auto focus really snaps the picture tighter and cleaner.this camera is bringing all the fun back in to shooting , pets and outdoors, great buy with the one gig card, I have a video camera, so never use that feature.thanks amazon for amazing shipping once again!"
5,"Lovely, Tiny Camera!","I love this camera! It's so much fun to use, and there's so many little features, I'm still trying to figure it all out; the instruction manual is a little confusing. The pictures are all gorgeous, even at the lowest quality settings, and the battery lasts pretty long! The only thing I don't like about it is that the automatic flash is VERY bright. Luckily, this can be adjusted (with great results!), or completely turned off. I was amazed at how bright and clear my pictures were without the flash. It's a really incredible camera, the best in its class!"
5,Nice camera,Nice little camera for travel and college. Takes a beating and keeps going. Many of my daughter's friends recommended this camera and it has not disappointed.
4,User Friendly,Quick start up and user friendly. Even my kids like taking pictures with it.( and some of them turn out fairly well. =)
4,Great pocket camera,"I bought this camera for my husband as a Valentine's Day gift. A few years ago, he had purchased a Pentax Optio for me with a lot of features, which made it bulky. This one is a sleek, small, tought little guy that takes nice pictures. We took it underwater (using the underwater casing of course) and got lots of nice pictures of the reef and different fish. In comparison to the Pentax, the night/evening pictures it takes are nice, but not as good. (I am able to set my Pentax on a tripod and go to manual mode to set the proper speed and shutter). All in all, we are very happy with this camera and would recommend it to anyone."
5,Meant for reading aloud to very little girls,"The collaborative effort of writer Ellyn Bache and artist Carol Tornatore, Daddy And The Pink Flash is a picture book story meant for reading aloud to very little girls, about the bond between a new dad and his baby daughter. Celebrating the joy of making designs and experiencing the enthusiasm of life, Daddy And The Pink Flash is a truly delight, warmly illustrated with realistic color artwork."
1,Jacked up,"Packs in reality weigh much less than 2 pounds but not to these guys. You'll pay 1 cent for the boosters, but shipping equal to 2pounds of cards. Don't fall in this trap."
2,beware!,"Beware! Even though item looked like a good product. It was listed as a ""set"" I ordered what I thought would be two ""sets"" but received two single ends. For the $ there are much better, and more economical options."
5,blankis_27@hotmail.com,"hi,Well these book is totally good!Cindy and Sally are jelous of the new girl, because she is pretty than them!! Adam and Watch fall in love with her !!When they see the balls the new girl was acting like she was received them !Adam rescue she from the balls but one ball enter in adam's body!When he wake up fron the electricity of the balls he can't remmeber anything and he was acting weird!Sally call Cindy home to tell her that they have to investigate Adam!But Adam isn't home when they tried to talk to him he capture them and he what that a ball enter to their body!!Hey is some have read the book Creppy Creature, Phone fear or Witch give, please you can tell me?

1,Irritating,"After listening to the first CD in the set I was ready to stab my own ears out. I usually like Berlitz. I hate this CD offering however.There is WAY too much English spoken. It makes this course very tedious to listen to. EX. Now we're going to learn to count. One, Eins, Two, Zwei, Three, drei. OK, I get the numbering system, even without repeating each and every number in English! They do the same for the alphabet, first letter in English and then in German. A, A, B, B, C, C. Stop me if I'm going too fast here.The narrator is constantly saying, ""Good job!"" or ""Did you catch that?!"" or ""Excellent!"" after each and every pause for the listener to speak.Sorry, but this one just wasn't my cup of tea."
2,"Nothing like being obvious, huh?","I'm inclined to agree with the Reader From Atlanta...when I see five or more reviews, with similar dates that all seem to gush with very similar generic enthusiasms, ""Please, someone pinch me, this book is so Wonderful"", the gauge on my b.s. meter starts heading for redline."
3,"Does what I needed it to, but not perfect","In general, this product did what i expected it to do. Putting it together did present some challenges though. One of the drawers simply did not fit and I had to re-drill holes to make it work. It wasn't terribly difficult but for someone without tools it could be a deal breaker. The doors for the bottom half don't shut flat against the cabinet and it looks a bit odd seeing it like that too. My biggest issue with this unit is the side parts (towel rack and (knife?) holder). I get the towel rack but I can't find a single use for the knife holder. I can't see myself storing knives in it and most uses I could try would result it in becoming dirty. In their defense, the manufacturer did add a quick-remove bottom to this part to aid in cleaning. I may end up simply removing it. I would much rather have had the spice rack/towel holder that is in other models."
3,"The ""book"" of this book/CD combo contains only the ""introduction""","If you click on the ""Search Inside"" on the Amazon website about this book, it shows a book that contains 215 pages of introduction, chapters, appendix, etc. However, the set I received today actually includes only a small booklet titled ""An INTRODUCTION to the Way of the Bodhisattva"". The book literally contains only the introduction (63 pages) but does not include the chapters of the text about ""The Way of the Bodhisattva"". I think the book/CD set is intended for those who want only to listen to the book but not to read it."
3,Least Favorite Garrett novel,"This one just doesn't reach out and grab me. Normally I read these in one sitting and this one I read in fits and spurts over several days. I think the story line is just a little too chaotic, and some of the character development is just not up to par. This novel includes, supposedly, a lot of the back story/introduction wrt Belinda Contague and Penny Dreadful and yet I don't know that I know either of these characters any better for having read this book. It isn't awful, but certainly not his best."
4,GOOD INTRO,"Mr Kurzweil is the Carl Sagan of the A.I. community. If you haven't already read ""The Age of Spiritual Machines"" and you're interested in A.I. then buy the book. Mr Kurzweil (as many have stated) is too optimistic and does largely ignore the political and behavorial tendencies of us bags of water but that doesn't make it any less an enjoyable and informative read.If you want to read the possible bad outcomes, read the Unibombers Manifesto. It's too bad he's evil and crazier than Michael Jackson because it's an interesting read."
4,Pretty Good,"My respect for this book has actually increased through repeat readings, but I would have liked to seen more evidence for the claims he's making."
4,Really makes you wonder,Brilliant is the best word to describe this work. Kurzweil has brought the future into something of a focus with this amazing look into the future. What really makes this work is that you can't 'see' exactly what the future will be even though he brings you further along than you have been. We can't see past the singularity - it will be something amazing - but we cannot truly conceive of what will be.This will change the way you view our world and the future of our race.
3,pricing ... ?,"Why should the Kindle version be priced at $19.99 while the printed version is $13.47.If Amazon or Kurzweil wants to sell me a digital version for $9.99, please contact me. Until then I'll ask my local library to order a copy.(Also, I thought I posted this earlier but I'm guessing it didn't stick to the hard drive.)"
2,See John Horgan's writings for a little balance,"I'm pretty much an agnostic on the question of whether or not Kurzweil's fundamental assumptions are correct. I do think, however, that one should seek out opposing views before rejoicing in his assertions (or panicking, depending on one's point of view). John Horgan is one such voice of dissent, and I recommend reading his essay entitled ""Brain Chips and Other Dreams of the Cyber-evangelists"", which you can find by googling. Here's his last paragraph, which might be good advice to disciples of Kurzweil: ""I try to forget this vale of tears myself now and then by reading books like William Gibson's Neuromancer or watching movies like The Matrix. But I also try not to confuse science fiction with science."""
3,A Little Thick,"This is not for the layman as a whole, but there are some interesting concepts presented. Hard to get through, but certainly brilliant."
4,A fascinating book,There are some really good numbers behind some of what Ray Kirzweil predicts for the future of computing and computer intelligence and that is very exciting reading. I have used some of this material for my lectures to my university freshman business students. On the other hand some of the material is a little too far into the realm of science fiction to be useful in a business class.
3,Should be about 30 pages,"Start on page 205 - read that - then take the rest as 'interesting'. The author spends a lot of time reinforcing the idea that technology is advancing rapidly - so rapidly that we're right on the edge of an extraordinary period and the beginning of a new human-machine symbiosis. Maybe. I have trouble drawing a line between the invention of the wheel and spaceflight and then concluding the human race should be at X in the future. There are wars, plagues, dead-ends and all other unintended and unforeseen consequences between those two items. Moreover, it's not necessary to make the author's point: Technology is going to change our society in ways we have not thought of, but should. It's an awkward time, meeting someone you don't know for the first time, especially if you made them.Best bet, read pages 205-298 and be done."
4,"Nice tongs, too bad they are made in China",They are nice tongs and good quality. Too bad Messermeister while choosing to make their knifes in Germany decided to go cheap route with some other items and make them in in China.
2,Not enough romance; not enough action; too much dialog,"Whatever happened to Elizabeth Lowell's steamy romances like ""To The Ends of the Earth"" and ""Winter Fire""? ""The Wrong Hostage"" was...well, it was boring and confusing. There was so much unnecessary dialog about Mexican politics and drug lords that I just tuned it out. (Oh, I listened to this book on CD.) There was zero chemistry between Grace and Joe and only one steamy scene between them. This was very slow moving to the point that by the time I got to the last CD, I was so bored that I just wanted it to end. It was way too long; way too complicated; definitely not worth the time it took to finish it."
2,Boring and confusing,"First, I have to say that I normally love any book written by Ms. Lowell...except this one! Reading the book, I felt that several authors wrote this book without consulting each other! The story line was weak, and hard to follow. Also, I found it very hard to believe that a CA judge would not know about the drug trade with Mexico! There is NO way she would be that naive! Also, she knows how to access CIA files....but doesn't about drug king pins-hmmm. I was actually going to not finish the book, but kept hoping that it would get better...it didn't! Do not judge Ms. Lowells book by this one. If this was your first and you didn't like it, try her earlier works!"
1,A Childrens book with cutout domes.,"Don't be fooled by the title of this book. It is not an architectural treatise, it's a children's book with cutouts that let you make a paper model. If you want a good book on the architecture of Geodesic Domes, buy a biography of Buckminster Fuller."
4,worth the price for one night of fun!,I needed something cute and fun for my little one who is almost 2 years old and it fit him just right. I have another son who will be 3 (tall for age and slim - 32 lbs) in Dec and this did not fit at all. Just a heads up for those with a 3 yr old and tall for age.
4,Cute & Not Too Hot Or Cold,"Yes, the costume doesn't stand straight up like the photo suggests, but it's well designed for the various sizes that a 2 year old will be in. My son is long and skinny and 2 and a half years old and it just barely fit -- but it fit! He also has an enormous head (he's in the 98th percentile for his age) and the hood fit, too. I love the fact that the pants extend over the feet and make the shoes look all clunky. It also seems really comfortable for my son."
4,CLIP ONS,"This is what I was looking for after being unable to find them at a couple of local retail businesses. I usually go through a couple pairs of these in the summer. If your lenses are particulary thick then the clips won't quite ""grab"" as they should but will still work and not slide around too much."
5,Great Book!,The book was very informative. It gave a good look of the problems that a global executive may face when dealing with an international business.
4,Arthurian lore,"I have three books by Markale (The Celts, Women of the Celts, and this one), and this is the only one that impressed me in the least. Despite its stupid title, this book is full of valuable information, historical, political, and mythical. Arthurian lore and speculations about the historical Arthur are not one of my favorite things of this sort, but for someone looking for a professional study of it, this is your book."
5,Must Have,"If your dealing with anyone in your life with a brain injury, this book is for you. It helped us understand what was going on and the exercises were a good tool to help in the recovery process. I am so thankfully I found this book. And would highly recommend it to everyone."
3,Jessica McClintock Lotion,"I like the lotion. I have never used her lotion before so wasn't sure how it would smell and/or feel. I like the way it feels, but it has kind of a ""soapy"" smell to me. It goes away after a little while, but the initial smell is a little stronger than I like. I like the way the perfume smells better."
5,An interesting read with a twist at the end,"I will not include any spoilers here - suffice it to say that a 12 year old starts to exhibit powers that Jesus once exhibited - healings, etc. The artwork highlights the drabness and ordinary, humble origins of this boy and hints that others have been waiting for these powers to surface.The ending has a good plot twist - good enough that I read it 3 times to make sure I got it right.The end of this edition has a ""DVD extras"" discussion between author and artist full of the little clues they had put in along the way and their motivations for making this graphic novel. It's a welcome addition.Good work on this one. I give this one a grade of ""A""."
2,Choose something else,"Short, predictable, and disappointing. I had high hopes and high expectations for this book, whether it turn out to be an iconoclastic indictment of fundamentalism or a celebration of Christianity and a fresh take on the story of the second coming. Unfortunately, it was neither of these. Protagonist Jodie Christianson is interesting enough, but his character doesn't drive the story so much as the predictable, pedestrian, forced-mystery plot does, and anyone who is versed in Christian tradition at all should see that twist ending coming well before the climactic reveal. Having loved other works by Millar, such as Aztek (with Grant Morrison) and Superman: Red Son, I was greatly disappointed with how absolutely average Chosen turned out to be.Ultimately, there's very little actually wrong with Chosen, there's just nothing new there. Millar never steps off of a well-worn path, and an otherwise good idea suffers because of that."
3,Modern Boy,I thought this was a well written and acted movie. The charecters were right on; for that time period.
4,Very Informative,"I am alway impressed with the job Dr. Sears does in his books, this one should definately be in any new mother's library. It is a good read because it is very instructional and very informative on the benefits of breastmilk."
2,VERBOSE,"I didn't even finish this book as I couldn't handle the repetitive nature. What could be said in one paragraph is repeated in different ways to cover multiple pages -- I get it, breast is best, which is why I'm reading this book to begin with. You don't have to preach.There is some helpful information about latching, etc, but the amount of useful tidbits and guidance has thus far has been minimal compared to the total length of the book. Being pregnant with my first child I was looking for more information about how to breastfeed successfully and how to identify cues to establish a good routine, not why I should and why I'll be a failure if I don't.Mostly, I could handle the information provided if I didn't feel like it was repeated over and over. I work better with straightforward, to the point information, not droning on and on without getting to the point. It was way too verbose for my liking -- definitely quantity of quality!"
1,Do not buy it,"This book is difficult to read and waste of money. If you are interested in Robespierre go the great book ""Revolutionary Career of Robespierre""."
5,Rubinstein Topples de Larrocha,"Dear Readers, Rubinstein does not deserve to be mentioned in the same sentence with de Larrocha. The fact is that he ""LOVED"" Spanish music and de Larrocha made her career on it. It's very beautiful what she does, but Rubinstein goes to the heart everytime. You'll get a glimpse of this if you compare the two. They are in very different zones."
4,A Mini Encyclopedia.,"At a rather advanced age, I have decided to learn chess, but I need a lot of help so I bought The Complete Idiot's Guide. Here I uncovered an unbelievable amount of information. It answered just about every question that I had, although it did take a bit of effort. I agree with some of the other reviewers that it could have been organized better because I didn't want to wait 150+ pages to find out what was recommended for the opening. Call me a traditionalist, but I would have preferred to read about the opening at the start of the book. Wolff certainly did a good job of explaining the intricacies of chess though. The examples he includes (shown as pictures of games from famous matches) are very helpful and improved its educability. One could visualize exactly what it was he was talking about via the aide of example boards. For me the book was a good investment towards becoming an average player."
1,Nice features but the ice tastes foul,"Lots of features on this gizmo. But features can't mitigate the fact that the ice has a foul plastic taste. Perhaps this unwanted flavor ""enhancement"" will diminish with time, however I'm not willing to wait and find out. I'd avoid this product and make ice the old fashioned way by putting water in ice cube trays and placing them in your freezer."
2,"Pretty, but.....","Easy enough to assemble once you decipher their instructions. One piece was damaged and had to force fix it to make it work. Screws aren't long enough for the cushion to attach to the bench, I used longer screws. Glass shelves don't fit right, the unit isn't squared correctly. Looks pretty though."
4,"Witty, entertaining mystery",Highly entertaining. I read it because I am an annual visitor to Long Beach Island and was pleasantly surprised to find it engrosssing and very humorous. I hadn't really been expecting much. Liked it enough to want to read the author's other offerings.
4,Feminism & Ecology: the key for Humanity History change.,"There is no future on Earth if human beings don't change our set of values and if we don't increase the real importance of women's values for society versus male values. Male values have brought humanity to exploitation of undeveloped countries, races and women and also, they have brought Earth to severe enviromental problems. The change of mind in undeveloped countries societies, which are closer to nature than occidental countries are, is the key for a broader change worldwide."
2,Worthless for me.,"My cats played with them and pulled them off. They are hard to apply. Also, they are very thin, so you'd need lots of them to cover an entire corner."
4,Sticky Paws,"So far so good, I have two cats and this seems to be keeping them from completely ruining my sofa. Make sure you vacuum any hairs that may be on the material as it will not stick if there are hairs present. Also be careful when applying it is very sticky and will stick to your fingers pulling it right off. But once you get it on it works well."
5,No more scratch marks,"My cat was tearing up our brand new chair and I was about to get rid of her, a friend suggested I try this product, I was skeptical, but I ordered and tried it. So glad I did, my cat no longer scratches on the chair, she won't even go near it now. I now can have a nice new chair and keep my cat."
5,Great Children's Album,"As a 10 year fan of Trout Fishing in America, I can unequivocally say that this is my favorite band of all time. I see them live whenever they come thru Texas. This album is a good childrens album, with lots of songs you can sing along with (even if you don't have kids).If you are looking for more adult songs, check out ""Who Are These People?"", ""Truth Is Stranger Than Fishing"", or ""Over the Limit""."
4,"Humanitarian view of science, scientific view of humanity","The ideas flow freely, however there is a central theme. DB obviously had babies in mind when writing / compiling this book!What makes this collection different is his essays on 'otherness', which I sometimes found more stimulating than the stories that they separate.His last essay, however, I found off beam. The conjectures he offers didn't quite hit the mark, and I felt they needed more development - as Mr Brin would ordinarily do to his short fiction."
4,Slow as Maple Syrup in January ... and Just as Tasty,"I love this album ... but I will defend the rights of anyone to hate it. On paper, this whole concept shouldn't work. The beat is slow enough to appear hesitant. The guitars are strumming one chord off a Velvet Underground album. But by god, they captured a mood perfectly - ""Listen The Snow is Falling"" says it all. Galaxie 500's ""On Fire"" has better songs, but this album is their most individualistic statement. Perfect summer listening."
3,Not for Beginners,"I recently purchased this CD package to refresh my high school Spanish. I thought it was going to be like previous Berlitz audio Spanish I have used (which was entirely in Spanish) and it is not. It is adequate for me because I am just refreshing, however while the topics are beginner level, the way it is presented is not.It has the annoying female voice that speaks in English all the time. The course work is a bit confusing, because it doesn't really follow a pattern that would make learning easy.I would be very frustrated with this package if I didn't already know Spanish. I would not recommend this for someone that is trying to learn Spanish from scratch. There are other Berlitz options that are much better for complete beginners."
3,Anthropology vs. insight,This is more of a pretty anthropological book than an essay on the power or inner meaning of world rituals of womanhood.
4,Caveat for med students,"As a fresh 3rd year med student starting his first rotation, which happened to be surgery, I quickly realized this book is leaps and bounds ahead of what we need to know. Unfortunately, the comments on the back of the book make it seem suitable for medical students but this book is clearly for surgical interns/residents."
4,very helpfull,"being new to paint shop pro I needed a book to get me started.This book has been a great help.Its easy to understand ,has the basics plus some things to use once you are advanced in the paint shop pro."
2,Excellent documentation but . . .,"This concise and thorough documentation of the software is what is says: ""Not a tutorial"". Some of us need a tutorial."
2,Funky Mirror,"The mirror on this clock is terrible. It's exactly like looking into one of those mirrors in a fun house at the fair. You are extremely distorted. While the clock works, its a bit tricky to set and the buttons are labeled S/L/M. Seconds/???/Minutes Not real sure what the L stands for; if you push it once you get the date and twice you get the seconds, third time returns you to the actual time."
5,Sarah Shannon City Morning Song,"SARAH SHANNON ""City Morning Song""The wonderful almost swing based-even--jazz-based bounce to this collection, is a perfect merge with Sarah's lilting, lively and lovely voice. She has designed the melodies and lyrics to embrace the great range and emotions of her singing: searching, hoping, finding-sometimes rejoicing and loving-but, some do darken ""slow down...look around..."" then brighten ""universe found...along the way."" She poetically touches the immense and complicated search of life-the joy and sadness. Her voice can be breathy and urgent, then almost classically soaring, always backed by this wonderful orchestration. The moving chorus: ""On and on...On and on!"" Well-that's life. What songs and rhythms! Right, the bounce! It makes us ""Boomers"" want to jitterbug!"
3,A good example of art imitating life imitating art,"The first thing I notice when I open the book is the paragraph stating that the author wrote the book during the 90s but due to fairly recent events delayed its publication. I also notice two copyright dates, 1997 and 2003, which was a key indicator to me that the author probably went back and did some revisions, which to me makes this a clear case of art imitating life imitating art. I thought the book was pretty good, but I think there were a few loose ends surrounding certain characters and their relevance to the plot. I do think this book would make a good movie but in this post 911 age we must tread carefully with our entertainment imitating real life too closely."
2,Wings that flew....,"I was disappointed in this item. The wings on the bird keep coming off.Now they have dissappeared all together. Bad design, and too much money."
3,Good basic alarm clock,"This unit is a good basic alarm clock for those who don't want the standard annoying alarm that most digital alarm clocks come with. I found the bird wake sound to be the best, waking me gently. I like that the cycle gets a bit louder the second time around so that if you are in a deep sleep it can still wake you. One problem I have with it, the volume dial when set to the loudest point causes the sound to completely cut out. I assume it's a flaw just in my unit, not enough to go through the trouble of sending back. Also the unit is a bit bulky, the display is large, but I think they could have made the unit smaller without loosing any function."
5,A classic bolero CD from two of Puerto Rico's greatest voices.,"Both Andy Montanez and Ismael Miranda are giants of Puerto Rican music and this bolero CD is flawless. ""Niebla Del Riachuelo"", ""Deuda"" and ""Obsesion"" are mesmerizing but all ten songs are superb. Wether you play this CD as background music during a romantic candlelight dinner for two or as you cruise down the freeway or streets in your car it's sure to please."
1,"It began rusting within the first week, and fell apart to piece within a year.","Rust started showing up within the first week, and the entire pot fell apart to piece within a year. It is a shame Amazon still carries this 'copper' pot after so many negative reviews. I bought it in 2007 at a low price. At the time, the title was 'copper hose pot', without the 'finish' qualifier. I did not return because the price was really low, and that returning a 20 lbs pot could be a real hassle besides that I had lost its original packaging. I felt really guilty to buyers in the past few years for not returning it to Amazon at the time. Most people probably did not return this junk to Amazon because it was such a hassle."
1,The product I received doesn't work,"I bought this watch for my daughter's birthday's. She opened her gift, loved the design, but it doesn't work. First of all, this product did not came with the ""Important User's Notice for Automatic Watches"", so I looked on YouTube and found an Instructional Video recorded by Larry Magen, (Stuhrling Original's President) and followed all his instructions, and still this watch doesn't work, I think the self wind mechanism came damaged."
1,Simplistic.,"Most of what is in this book really has very little to do with making video look like film. Rather, Shaner spends a lot of time talking about very basic issues of general photographic lighting as well as audio editing -- not sure what audio has to do with the ""film look"" really. He also spends a lot of time talking about aspect ratio such as 16:9 which imply film format, but again -- it is a technique that has NOTHING to do with REALLY making video look like film. Finally he includes a short video that has been altered using the ""Magic Bullet"" software he seems to promote a lot. The sample he includes is quite awful. Honestly, the original unprocessed video looks BETTER the final ""film look"" outcome. The ""film-look"" template which is available with even the most basic digital editing software such as an entry level Pinnacle software."
4,out of the box,"It gave me a differant view on recovery. It was presented as a combination of the Big Book, Zen Buddism and the orange papers and althou I found very little of the Orange papers in it I enjoyed his perspective and his physiological definition of alchoholism and how the liver works."
1,Fire hazard?,"After almost a year of perfect operation, with the rice cooker being used about twice a week, suddenly it wouldn't switch itself off. Nor could the on/off switch be operated manually. The rice just kept cooking and cooking. After about 55 minutes we pulled the plug out of the wall and tipped out what was by now a solid block of rice. It was lightly burned underneath and a bit on the sides. It seems to me that if we had been relying totally on the auto shut-off feature then there must have been a very real risk of fire. This is not only a big concern but also a big disappointment. The compact size and excellent non-stick finish had been just perfect for us."
2,Does not keep rice warm once cooked,"This is a good rice cooker for a single person who just wants to make a small quantity of rice and likes the convenience of a rice cooker. Problem with this cooker is, once it cooks the rice it doesn't keep it warm--it just shuts off so you may find yourself eating cold rice."
5,works very well,"My internet homework resulted in that this rice cooker was one of the better ones which is why I purchased it. I was a bit blown away by how small this cooker was for the price, however it is exactly what I needed. It IS a mini-rice cooker. You must use the measurement cup provided and follow the instructions or you will have a boil over problem. I used it mostly to cook quinoa and it cooks it perfectly. For one person servings this rice cooker does the job. I do wish it had a warmer mode as much cheaper models do. It is very nice not to have to hover over the quinoa or rice as it cooks and to know it will be taken care of automatically and be perfectly cooked. Also clean up is very easy. I hand wash mine as I do not want it exposed to the harsh cleaning of a dishwasher."
1,No quality Control,I purchased this bed in October and slept on it for 1 night. When I woke the next morning the bottom chamber had leaked a significant amount of air.I requested a replacement (which came the next day) and the same problem happened. It's obvious there is no quality control at this company
3,This ain't the purple hair Zeros,"In case anyone is as big a fan as I am of the Zeros from the Sunset Strip days when they painted the Whisky A Gogo purple this is a definitely a different band. How confusing. Get a copy of 4,3,2,1 The Zeros by the purple haired glampunks to hear what us mongers loved about them."
2,Audiobook is disappointing,"Being a fan of Eliziabeth Lowell, I'll buy anything with her name on it. This tape has taught me ""buyer beware."" First I was appalled that the reader did not have the appropriate accent. Secondly, I was stunned that the book had been condensed enough to fill only one side of the tape. The audio is repeated start to finish on side 2! I was very unimpressed. The book was wonderful and exciting and suspenseful but the tape is dull, boring, and bland. Save your money and buy the book."
2,Sorry...,"...I know I'm in the minority here but I didn't enjoy this book at all. Half way through it I was angry. My husband asked me what was wrong. When I told him I felt like I was in school studying a Shakespeare book rather than reading a romance novel he begged me to stop reading it and read Johanna Lindsey, Connie Mason, Judith McNaught... ANYTHING! The only reason I finished it was because I kept going back and reading the reviews and asking myself, why? Well, I guess that's what's so great about us all, we all have our own taste."
1,Poorly made,"Purchased for Valentines day for my g/f. This watched lasted 4 months. Water leaked in during a beach walk in the rain... A beautiful watch to look at, packaging is also top notch, but just poorly made. Was so disgusted with this watch, I threw it out. I also purchased one - it lasted 3 months longer. Pretty much fell apart.... again binned it.. didn't bother with the warranty... all in all beautiful pretty crap"
5,Great Book,"A lady I know worked in Halls china in East Liverpool Ohio, she loves looking at the book and telling stories about the plant and the time she worked there. She has a lot of the china and I find myself collecting it. This book is a great help, and I am very thankful to have found it."
2,"Interesting, but far behind ""...Wild Bore""","Having just about turned blue laughing at the author's previous book ""How to Tame a Wild Bore"" -- of course I tracked down this book. It too bad it's just not as funny as ""Bore"" -- where Lewis Grizzard made a great, very funny, target, and that got played to the hilt.This book is more of an afterthought. Kathy goes to Montana, falls in love, marries, and spends the rest of the book strugling with the wilds, barbed wire, storms (etc.). With one small problem. It seemed strained, and not very funny.Oh, yeah, a laugh or two, and it's nice to see Montana was a good change for Kathy, Lisa & Bruce (her kids) but of course the burning question: Where's Barney? The dog was one of the best features of the first book. :-)If this book falls into your lap, or you can check it out at the library, it's interesting and amusing, but ""garage sale"" is as far as you should go for this book. ""How to Tame a Wild Bore"" is a scream, get it for sure."
5,Wildly entertaining and informative popular history,"In Among the Mansions of Eden David Weddle tells the wildly entertaining, absolutely true story of Beverly Hills from the perspective of land and real-estate development, how movie stars, moguls, and agents, captains of industry and lords of finance, bankers, oil barons, dealmakers, speculators, highrollers and lowballers, old Eastern wealth and new Western fortunes transformed some two square miles of dirt at the base of the Santa Monica mountains into a synthetic paradise of almost unimaginable wealth, building massive pleasure-palace homes of preposterous lurxury and the most lavishly borrowed grandeur that money can buy. Superbly written, first rate in every way."
1,Didn't even last a year,"I own two of these. The first one just died and never worked again. The second one slowly lost its ability to hold a charge after 1 year. I called the company and they wanted ME to pay to ship this heavy battery so they could ""possibly"" replace it. The shipping would cost me $20 for a $39 product. I don't call that warranty service. They weren't even nice on the phone. Do yourself a favor and buy a different brand. I bought another one of these types of jump packs from Autozone. Different brand. It has been working well for 2 years now. I won't go back to Vector or Black and Decker for jump-starter packs."
5,Home Cafe,I have enjoyed using this coffee maker. It makes 1 cup at a time and the coffee is hot and delicious. I would recommend this product to anyone who wants a single cup coffee maker.
1,Doesn't last,"Am very disappointed with the one-cup coffee maker. Coffee was a little weak but no better using two pods. Also, is no longer working at all. Lasted less than six months."
1,B&D Coffee Killer,"This is the worst piece of crap I have ever purchased. First one started malfunctioning within a week and died. Called service and they said to cut the cord off and send it in. Second one lasted almost two weeks and died the same way. Customer Service acted like this has occured a thousand times. I am a woodworker and buy lots of tools. Because of the lack of quality of this machine, I am done with Black and Decker tools. I threw the last one away and didn't even bother with the warranty. I'm out 30 bucks, but a lesson well learned. My new Kuerig works fantastic. Senseos are also good."
1,Weak watery coffee,Tried pods reccommende Folgers used one two still coffee tastes watery.HELP..I want a rich full bodied cup of COFFEE
5,1 cup coffe maker,my husband is only one who drinks coffee in our house-loves that he can get a fresh cup everytime---replaced older version of same coffee pot-larger cup holder size real nice-so far its been great
2,Decent for 8 almost months then the electronics failed,The machine made good coffee with Folger pods for almost eight months but then the electronics failed.I can not say that it was a good investment.
1,Do not buy this movie unless you want to be sad :(,We bought this movie to watch with our nephews and nieces and boy were we unpleasantly surprised! As other reviewers have mentioned it is very sad and the acting is horrible. It is an immediate holiday good mood killer and made us all sad. The ending is not even that uplifting after you suffer through the movie. I wish I had not wasted 90 minutes on this Disney disaster!
1,TERRIBLE CHRISTMAS MOVIE,"This was the worst Christmas movie ever. My four year old child cried loud sobs through most of the movie. I had to fast forward to the happy parts so that she would know there was a happy ending. Santa nearly dies, the dog turns into a stuffed toy and is nearly burned, and the WORST PART - the little girl has just lost her parents and is all alone. How is that heartwarming to a small child at Christmas? ""Hey, kid, you could also lose both of your parents and be all alone at a very young age. Merry Christmas.""I'm so mad at this being rated G. Clearly it needs a much higher rating."
