2,Not what I expected,"Good book, but lacks actual engineering data, such as detailed mechanical properties..."
3,Great book but not the normal treehouses,"Geat book, great info, great value. But note that the treehouses are not your regular treehouses but rather boats, cars, nests, etc."
5,Best Of Genesis,"You know, Ive listened to my fair share of Psychic TV, and this album is the best. By far. High energy without being overwhelming. And it has some really phat beats on it. My advice is to BUY BUY BUY!"
2,Success remains out of reach for Flash on final album.,"By this, their third album, it was quite obvious that Flash were not going to give Yes a run for their money. In fact, Flash wouldn't even come close to matching Yes' commericial and artistic successes. A lame concept album about some guy from the Planet Catalina, Out Of Our Hands stumbles in the usual places: weak vocals, inane lyrics, lack of keyboards, etc. Why group leader/guitarist Peter Banks never bothered to replace Tony Kaye on keyboards after the first album is the head-scratcher here. Trying to do it all on guitar, Banks and band mates just can't seem to muster the musical depth to keep up with their prog-rock counterparts (although Banks' guitar work here is awesome, as usual). After this album, Banks retired Flash altogether and started a new band called Empire. They recorded three album's worth of material in the late '70s - none of which was ever released by a major label until just recently (on One Way)."
2,Not Useful,I am a little over halfway through the book and I doubt I will finish because it just can't hold my interest (and I am very interested in the subject). It reads like a technical college text and is definately not a fun book. After reading what I have I haven't picked up one useful real-world exercise to try and it contains less info about body language than other good books like Body Language Secrets or Undercover Sex Signals. I have Superflirt on order and am hoping it has more real-world useful information and advice.
4,So far I like it. Could be more in the stick.,"Coming from someone that's been using blistex addictively for about 6 years now, I switched it up and bought some of this because I had been getting cold sores. I'm fairly certain my overuse of blistex was causing many of my cold sores. This stuff actually makes my lips feel better overall and I'm getting a lot fewer sores now (haven't had one since trying it a few months ago). I also seem to need to use it a lot less. Love the scent too, it contains lemon balm but has more of a vanilla smell and no flavor so you're not licking it off trying to get a taste.My only real issue is that they could give you a little more product. Considering it has about 30% less than a regular chapstick type lip balm, I feel a little ripped off. that's why only 4 stars."
4,great reference book for improving your skills,"This book is a great way to see another way of looking at printing black and white photographs. The author is usually printing other people's negatives, but the knowledge gained can be even more useful when the printer is also the photographer. The end result should be in mind when the photograph is taken, thus the printing will be much easier. This isn't a good how-to book in the sense that it is fairly advanced. It is good at presenting another theory about printing, and teaching techniques that are very effective."
5,A book about better men living in a better time.,"A book about history, travel, valour, and living life properly. The Master recounts his personal experiences from a full life well-lived, and does so with eloquence, wit and well-tempered nostalgia. I expecially recommend the chapters dealing with his education, early military career and his devotion to wife and family. His thoughts on weaponry are, as always, well-reasoned and impeccably presented. A must-read. The edition is superb."
3,I just don't know any more...,"I try. I really do. I try to be the best creator that I can be and along comes this guy with a handbook on how MY creations can ""become"" me. Quite frankly, I'd like to see you try, and if you succeed, more power to you."
5,I'm a Fan Of This Product,"OK, I admit the title is a little corny, but I was not in any way disappointed with this fan when it arrived. It is obviously well made, has 3 speeds and moves a lot of air. I mounted it on a wall in my workshop to help me cope with the hot, muggy weather we have here in Florida during spring and summer. You can stand a good 15 to 20 ft. away from it and still feel a breeze, which is exactly what I wanted. It can be mounted with the bracket horizontal for up and down adjustment, or vertical for side-to-side adjustment. It only has one mounting bolt hole in the bracket, which seemed a little strange but I used a 7/16"" bolt (I believe the manufacturer recommended a 3/8"" bolt) and it is solid with no noticeable vibration at the higest speed. You can hear it when its running but for the amount of air it moves I think the noise level is very acceptable. If you need air movement in a large room, you can't go wrong with this fan."
2,Terrible sound engineering,"The piano drowns out the violin throughout. One has to wonder who emgineered this and why.It is not possible, as one reviewer suggests, that it's Midori's fault. There are separate microphones and separate dials where the engineer reads sound levels of each. I am a pianist and like to hear the piano clearly, but this recording was ruined by the imbalance. I would recommend later Midori recordings over this one.It is not easy for Asians to break into the big time, so it is a testatment to Midori, I suppose, that they publish and sell this botched recording. I suspect there are other Asian artists who would become known and loved by Wedterners if obstacles like this were not put in their way.- An American fan of Midori"
2,Nothing special.,"First of all, I can't see how this book can come off saying it's for students. A big hunk of the monologues are NOT age appropriate. They're for older women, looking back on their lives. It is important to know your range - and I'm sorry, but college students just aren't in their 60s for the most part! We don't have the life experience to give honesty to these roles. Also, a huge chunk of the monologues for women are story telling, another thing you should try to avoid in monologues.I do NOT recommend this book to any college women who are looking for something to use at auditions."
4,Red Rocks on cold night...!,"I was at this concert and the show was good, as well as the Red Rocks Ampitheatre. It rained (as it almost always does at Red Rocks durning evenining concerts) throughout the concert and the crowd was pretty wet and cold. I am a fan of Neil Youngs music, but at this show it was a little to mellow for my taste. That being said I thought the purchase was good a nice addition to the collection."
3,I think the name in this product is ...,"I think the name in this product is misleading and that it shouldn't be billed as a plaque remover. If you want something to carry on you for the times when brushing and flossing aren't convenient, then these are great. The """"plaque removers"""" are in a small, easy to carry pack and are similar to a toothpick but stronger and won't splinter. But I wouldn't count on these to use as plaque removers -- use your toothbrush and dental floss to aid in that. I'll carry these to use as a toothpick, but not a something to use as a plaque remover."
5,Fork level,"Ok, seems to work properly, but was not able to use it. My fork retaing bolt's were stripped out so I did actually have to take it to the shop and just had them do it. So I can't really say but seems to work."
2,fall's short,"Flashlight side of sheath was small for some of the new size mini flashlight,had to go back to old style mag light for this sheath to work for me."
1,Lasted a week,I bought this so I wouldn't have to have a holster for my flashlight and one for my Leatherman tool. It lasted about a week. I sat down in a chair and the flashlight snagged on the arm of the chair breaking the belt loop. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.
3,Not made by Leatherman,"As near as I can tell this is not make by Leatherman, but is some Chinese licensed product or something.My Leatherman Super Tool 300 fits in it, my mini MagLight LED fits as well.Recently it got snagged when I was standing up, and the top stitches for the belt loop ripped loose. I debated returning it, but then the ""do-it-yourself-er"" in me got some heavy duty thread and a thick needle and a sewed it back together myself. I am fairly sure my stitches are stronger than the original, and several months later it is still doing ok."
1,For alternative music lovers only,"I hardly recognized some of the songs on this CD; lured by the great selection, I bought the split track version for group use at my bible study, but found many of the tracks quite unusable. I have heard, own, and love many updated/modern versions of worship songs -- for example, I love SonicFlood and the ""Worship Together"" collections -- but I found many of the arrangements on this album simply unattractive and distracting. Even if you like them, you may have trouble singing along, as the uncomfortable keys do not lend themselves well to participation...even the singers, many of which have a very distinctive grunge-band sound, are heard to strain painfully at times. A higher percentage of mainstream treatments, or at least a clearer indication of the nature of the album, would have been welcome."
3,Glow by J.Lo,"It is okay, very strong. Good for it's price.. it lasts a long time. Bitersweet smell. CHeck ingredients before buying if you are allergic to many plants."
2,Not as good as I hoped.,"Except for 'The First Cut Is The Deepest', I don't really get into this album. Maybe it will grow on me, but I will probably sell it. Interesting to see his early development."
1,POS,This item is a piece of s--*. It was poorly packaged and arrived already broken. It was readily obvious that the construction was far too fragile to survive even a very careful operator. I was so discusted with this item that I did not even bother to return it for a refund.
5,Excellent little shade,Now the glare on the LCD screen is minimized because of this inexpensive and clever little device. Why didn't somebody invent this earlier?
4,"Bought it, never read it","This was for a sociology course that I was forced to drop. From the little that I read, this seemed like a strong foundation for any political science or history major."
4,Good game for a preschooler :),"This game is a great game for a preschooler age child. It explains to a child that monsters don't have to be scary...they can actually be fun!! My child loved yelling ""GO AWAY MONSTER!"" when he picked a monster, and laughed so hard when he'd hide the monster. We still get this game out on occasion and play ( three years after purchase). It's worth the money and keeps a very young child content :)"
4,Good overview and summary of the problem,"Unlike many Y2K books which ""take sides"" in this controversial issue, this Unofficial Guide tries to present information on all parts of the issue. Since it was published in September 1999, the most recent data available was used. Whether you consider yourself a pollyanna, a doomsayer, or just want to find out what is the real ""scoop"" on this issue, this book presents a balanced view of all sides and arguments so you can make up your own mind."
5,This book is packed with lots of creative & fun ideas,"You'll never get bored using this book for ideas to use for family fun with your kids. The book is easy to read and organized by chapters then by sections for that theme or subject. It even has ideas on how to get your kids to do chores, a list of excellent books for kids to read, a chapter about vitues and more. There are activities you can do with your toddler, preschooler, school-age child or adolescence. While thre are activities/ideas that may be approriate for a specific age group, you can never run out of things to do with your child."
2,flat surfaces only,i bought it to make a glass bong doesnt work on round surfaces. i did make a grav bong out of it tho works only on flat surfaces
5,This is amazing,"This album is the most inovative record that hip-hop has ever seen. Not only does this contain amazing songs, but the skits keep you entertained. An amazing album which every true hip-hop fan must have."
4,Good product,"I have thick hair that tends to lay very fine. In other words, it can look like a helmet. This product holds well, it has a good shine, it does not weigh my hair down ( which was the most important feature) and it isn't sticky or stiff. It gives my layers good separation. Most waxes weigh my hair down within an hour or so. I look ok going out the door but within an hour, my hair is flat. This is very different. It is expensive but you only have to use a little bit. I wish I had known about this product earlier. I would recommend it. Don't let the price fool you. It will last a long time if you use it right."
5,Great Watch,"This is a great watch. It feels very light and the numbers are nice and large to see them while running. In addition, all of the crono and timer functions make it very versatile, meeting all of my training needs."
5,Toujours Moi,I have a dear friend who loves this perfume. Haven't been able to find it in stores for the past few years. Was happy to find it on Amazon and bought two bottles for a birthday gift. Smells wonderful! She was thrilled to have her favorite perfume again.
1,NONSENSE,"DOES THIS LOOK LIKE A FUEL PUMP! Contacted Amazon and they agreed...... 2 MONTHS AGO!!! Tried to get more information on the fuel pump from the company selling this (left several messages), never have they answered back. Guess you can't trust either......."
1,"A waste of time, money and paper","I need a book that walks me through an average interactive DVD project. All this book does is bore you to death with nonsense, and never walks you through a project.If I could sue for false advertisement, I would."
4,Great Game,"This is a great game to play, but it takes a few times to really figure out how to play and count out all the points. Once you figure it out though, it's a lot of fun."
3,Actually WORSE for two players,"I love playing Carcassonne with two, so I figured this would naturally be a great addition. I was wrong. Somehow this game manages to make a really fun two player game LESS FUN by making a specifically two player version. There are some interesting ideas like the extra tiles around the score track, but I don't think they come together into a coherent game.The extra tiles mostly increase scoring- some at the end and some as you complete buildings. The problem is that this makes scoring extremely unpredictable. In my last game I was ahead by twenty three with two turns left and ended up losing by 18 because my girlfriend got one very lucky tile that totally ruined the plan I had been working on with MY tiles.The ""biggest keep"" idea I actually think was a lot of fun. I might try the game with a different method of ""bonus tile"" distribution, and that's why it gets a 3/5. I really want it to be fun, but as written it's just not."
2,OK not much fun,It took the fun out of monopoly for me. It plays well but goodness why complicate the game so much!
5,"Awesome, Will Come Back","I wanted something that stood out for my portfolio, and came upon this while shopping. Not only was their price at least $20 less than every other website, but it arrived only a few days after I ordered it. UPS said it would get here on a Friday at the earliest, and it arrived a day early, Thursday. Very happy, awesome quality, will most definitely be a repeat customer."
5,Booksbycee Book Review for The West : An Illustrated History,"The West : An Illustrated History by Geoffrey C. Ward, Dayton Duncan has got to be one of the most ""Can't put down"" type of books I've had the wonderful pleasure of owning, ever! The illustrations, to many to count are of the finest quality I've ever seen in a book not to mention that the editorial choices were perfect. The photos depict the exact expressions that capture those lost moments in time... If you can get this book - buy it! It is for all ages and you could never grow tired reading it, as well. A certain coffee table type book! I rate this book a 5 STAR!"
1,Ugh,"I happen to know a thing or two about QBL, so a friend of mine asked me to give her my opinion on this book. I don't think this book could do more to insult the intelligence of the reader. Apparently there's no better way to make money than to sell the light of the creator in the form of a repackaged, recycled new age fad.If you're interested in QBL, I'd strongly recommend Lon Duquette's ""Chicken Qabalah"" instead, as a decent primer on the subject. I dare say Duquette's been studying the subject longer and from better teachers than Berg."
4,Very enlightening!,"I bought this book for my daughter and she absolutely loves it. She has owned a horse since she has been 3 yrs old and has always worked with them. She knows she wants to make a career working with them but not sure at the age of 13 what she would like to do just yet, so this book it giving her plenty of ideas and the expected salaries."
4,Nice throw to keep you warm,I purchased this throw because I always seem to be cold. I've only used once since I bought it yesterday but it kept me warm. All the blankets I saw do have a pattern of stripes or plaid so if you want a solid blanket choose another one.
3,Came so quick,"Came so quickly didn't get any good prizes when i entered the code!Oh well, good price. Don't recommend because there is one code in the pack."
5,Easy to use and lasts longer than expected...,"These charge quickly, seem to hold there charge well even when not used, and last long while in use. Very pleased with them and I ordered two more."
4,Works great but hard to get into & out of controllers.,They work just like the regular batteries but are kind of hard to get into & out of the backs of the controllers sometimes. It's worth the price though since you pay about half for it & I can put up with it for the cost savings.
4,good but could have been great..,"The cinematography of Spain and of the food is first rate. Getting a peak at Gwyenth Paltro in a relaxed setting was fun and Claudia Bassols was a joy both to the eye and ear. Mario Batali is one great chef and watching him in action made it difficult to not press pause and head for the fridge. I would have rated this DVD a five had it not been for Mark Bittman. I found his self-indulgence annoying and it distracted from just about every scene in which he was present. As a journalist he may be very good but, in my opinion, get him away from the keyboard and he is way out of his element. Sorry Mark...no Oscar for you this time."
2,Seriously?,"In the New York school of culinary hobnobbing, making unfunny and self-referential commentary about oneself and one's self-indulgent foodie experiences passes for polite behavior. When it's done under the guise of a ""road trip"" (in a Mercedes no less) it curiously fans the unrequited travel fantasies of homebound and monolingual Americans. I won't argue that the glitterati here don't know their stuff--they certainly do, and for that they get an extra star--but the blatant supplication to a demographic who doesn't bat an eye at dropping $8,000 on an international eating tour is nausea-inducing.I am immensely relieved however that the majority of Spain's culinary treasures--including about 90% of the best wine on earth--will remain in Spain due to draconian import taxes levied by the US. All the better for those of us who live here and get it for a fraction of what these guys paid."
2,"Charming, but not essential","Published in 1977, short after Elvis' death, more than two decades later this book is still fun to read, if you're an Elvis-fan. ""Starring Elvis"" contains the stories and a few pictures of the favorite Elvis-movies of James W. Bowser. These favorites are: Love Me Tender, Loving You, Jailhouse Rock, King Creole, Wild in the Country, Blue Hawaii, Follow That Dream, Kid Galahad, Girls!Girls!Girls!, Viva Las Vegas, Roustabout, Harum Scarum and Charro! Pretty famous movies, you have to admit that, but the choice is, of course, subjective. But the die-hard Elvis-fans will probably be interested in the accurate stories of these movies, because all dialogues, describtions etc. are well written down in this book. A lot of black and white photo's are included and some color photo's (don't forget, this is 1977), but they aren't rare to get. This book is only recommendable to the truly die-hard Elvis-fans. Happy hunting!"
3,Pretty but Inaccurate,"I bought this book expecting a lot of good pictures and diagrams. I did get that; however, I didn't get anything else. The saving grace of the book is that the pictures are in fact excellent, and, it does say right on the front cover that the pictures are from ninteenth-century sources. The 1800s' aren't exactly known for their high quality of historical accuracy, and it's only in the most contemporary armour, approximately late 1400's through 1600's, that the illustrations are most reliable. Before that point, it can be downright abysmal, as oftentimes it portrays armour from the wrong period; for example, suits of obviously 16th-century armour are depicted upon pages captioned ""14th Century"". I would not rely upon this as an factual source at all, and only use it as a source of clip-art or artistic inspiration. As I said, the pictures are pretty, but that's about it..."
1,"Very Limited, doesn't allow duplicate of Screens.","The matrox dual head 2 go looked awesome on the site but all it actually does is take one vga video out and stretch it on to two monitors. The resolution options are horrible, it is a massive pain to setup, and it refuses to keep the setting when you close a lid on a laptop, even though things are set to do nothing (no clue on that one). Horrible waste of money, do not buy."
2,Only supports limited number of resolutions,"It looks like this device can only support 1024x768 (60, 75 and 85Hz) and 1280x1024 (60Hz) and as a result it can only natively support monitors with this resolution. I.e. if you have a different monitor you are out of luck."
3,mishy mashy mess,"Daniel Myerson would have a good book on his hands if he knew what his book was. is it psychology? is it history? is it fiction? nonfiction? no one knows, least of all the reader. He obviously did his homework, but fudged on the facts so much that the line between scholarly work and novel is severely blurred. It would be nice if he had a clear and decisive point. However, it is an interesting work of literature and a good read for anyone who loves history and would like to know a little more about the most famous dictators."
3,"The lives and times of five tyrants,","Myerson does an alright job in detailing the bloody regimes of five tyrants. How does he pick these five top contenders, he does not tell. Since he cannot dwell on either of these five in great detail, the reader learns only the rudiments of each of these five leading contenders (Nero, Ivan the Terrible, Hitler, Stalin, and Saddam Hussein). As a previous reviewer has already noted, some of the aspects of Hitler's life is open to contention, so one cannot believe all of this story. Since Myerson does not detail any of his sources, one wonders where he received all the details.This is an easy read. If one wants to learn any detail of any of these five dictators, one must read elsewhere. As I said, this is a good summary of their lives, but don't believe everything you read."
2,Vista integration makes it terrible,"This is my 2nd Vaio, I bought it because of the great form factor (weight, size, etc). My first Vaio (an older model) worked very well. This one is just plain awful.The key problem with the laptop is the _basics_ just don't work. The webcam freezes. The wireless configuration disappears. The sound output stops through multiple reboots. Don't even bother with the fingerprint sensor.In my first 45 days I've re-installed Vista once, and have spent no less than 5 hours on the phone with tech support.Don't buy it."
3,Little Jittery,The Nicoderm product is not bad but it made me a bit jittery. I got a bit nervous that it could affect my blodd pressure so I stopped. Everybody reacts differently I guess. My friend did stop smoking completely because of it though.
4,Games,Very easy to use and so very practical to travel with Great customer assitance and feedback and all questions answered promptly and very happy with company
2,Great show,"Great show, the band was awsome but you could not hear the kick drum at all,which really takes away from the sound. That's the only reason for not giving it 5 stars."
5,VERY NICE!,I have this watch in the automatic model and have been very happy with it. The only problem is that when it goes in for service it's off to NJ for four to six weeks. I bought this one for a back-up and the convenience of the quartz movement. I can't believe how much lighter it is and how comfortable it is to wear. A slightly smaller case than the automatic. It has a sportier look and feel to it also. I really like it and it just came tody! I would give it 6 stars if I could.
1,A Language Course For Young People,"I gave this language course to my granddaughters as a present. They were happy to receive it. This course is especially interesting for them as they are German and must learn both languages, English and French, at school. So, with this CD they can repeat their English, which is the first foreign language to be learned, and study French at the same time. I like this course very much. I think it has been made especially for young people. I'm glad I found it at Amazon.com. I'd like to give 5 stars for this item.Ursula Krauß."
2,Way too basic,Didn't care for this. I found that it was irritating to listen to and I resold it within a week.
1,Don't waste your money!,Terrible attempt at teaching a new language. The irritating music that is constantly playing will drive you nuts! It doesn't even give you key phrases but you will learn to count from 1 to 10.
2,Standard TV movie fare,"Disappointing TV movie about a supposedly autistic boy, who is foistedon his bachelor uncle, who naturally doesn't want his lifestyle changed.But of course, Uncle slowly learns to love the tyke, who doesn't seemall that autistic. An average Lifetime type movie. A happy tear-jerking ending of course. I wouldn't object if it was done in a believ-able fashion."
2,unreadable,"This book is , not to put too fine a point on it, awful. In order to comprehend any of it you have to have read most of the previous books and even then this book is not very good. The characters blab on and on about nothing with frequent asides by the author. I have now read 5 books by Miss Thirkell and, for the most part, enjoyed them but this one is almost unreadable. Why two stars ? I like Angela Thirkell and I really liked the cover."
2,New size won't fit knife holder,The blade width has been increased. The new knives no longer fit a regular knife holder. The old style was much better.
5,SUPER SHARP AND LIGHT!,"i wish i have known about this sooner. i have a shoulder injury/ nerve damage arm. it is fantastic, no effort/ or much less effort when cutting. super light , super sharp, but hand wash only and i have to be careful as it is so sharp."
2,Bellyache,"I can only eat three of these at a time, which is fine, but if I grab a 4th cookie I am sick. Celiac bellyache sick. Definitely won't buy again, even though they are tasty. Sorry."
2,not to good,"We enjoy the van.cookies. The chocolate ones seem to be much much harder and drier. Not sure why, have tried different bags but always to dry."
1,A Real Disappointment,"I have been a fan of ASIA from day one. (That is the real ASIA, John Wetton, Carl Palmer, Steve Howe and Geoff Downes.)This DVD collection was not worth the money since the band only appears in 3 out of the 5 videos. I have never seen any of these videos and presume that they must have been played in other countries. If you are interested in other ASIA DVDs check out ASIA Live in Moscow and ASIA Classic Rock Legends. Both of these DVDs feature Pat Thrall on guitar. (He replaced Steve Howe) Both of these are definitely worth seeing if you enjoy ASIA."
3,Not expected,The cover gives the impression of much more pomp and pageantry that is to be expected. The DVD focuses too much on the history of the tattoo and makes too much of small-scale tattoos. Anyone thinking it is a tattoo all-in-one will be disappointed.
5,A very thoughtful book on the life of Agnetha,Although not extremely revealing this book offers many insights to the life and times of Agnetha. Many wonderful pictures and well worth the price!!
5,very helpful,"I bought this book so that I would be better able to keep my kindergarten daughter interested in and challenged by learning to read. I quickly discovered that it will be just as helpful (if not more so) for getting my 3 year old son off to a good start in his early literacy. I haven't read it cover-to-cover, but have browsed several sections and especially love the activities at the end of each chapter - they really make it fun for both kids and parents. During the summer break, I am sure I will use ideas and activities from this book almost daily to keep both kids learning. My favorite book on this subject that I have found!"
5,A great book about child neglect,"This book is recommend to a person who loves reading the kind of books that deal with child abuse, sexual abuse, and neglect. I love reading books that have a serious topic. These stuff is happening in the world and I really think teens these days need that kind of advice. They also need a role model to look up on, because some kids don't have there parents to take advice so that kind of book is perfect for any one who needs advice or who just want to read it. God Bless You!"
4,forged by fire,this book is so good. once you start reading it you just can't put it down. not even for a minute. this book tells you about a little boy who is being abused in his home. very emotional!!
5,Great book for All,This book was a great book with a great message. This book involves a boy by the name of Gerald whom has faced hardships since he was a young boy. He had to learn how to walk before he could learn how to crawl. This book talked about a subject that most authors wouldn't talk about child abuse. I love the way Gerald fought to protect his sister and himself from his abusive step-father. I would recommend this book to anyone between the ages of 13 and 21. This book will make anyone greatful that they have a loving and caring family at home to take care of them whenever they need them.
2,A Review,"After reading Forged by Fire by Sharon Draper, I have come to one conclusion: it was pretty boring. Some people might like the type of story where bad stuff happens to good people, but that kind of thing just doesn't interest me. I will admit it was very well written in the strong way the author describes Gerald's mother and then how Angel's father, Jordan Sparks, abused her. I also like how she describes how Gerald sees the flame from his mother's lighter when he is three years old."
4,forged by fire,"Very intense story and very well written. The main character Gerald and his step-sister Angel face verbal, physical, and sexual abuse but they find adults they trust and ask for help. Even though the themes are graphic and intense they are balances by the strength inside Gerald and Angel and the safety and stability they find when they reach out for help from trusted adults. When their parents let them down they get their role models from adults around them who earn their respect. I would recommend it for ages 14 and up although if you are thinking of buying this for pre-teen or teen I would recommend reading it first and judging for yourself."
4,Great Purchases,received the item on time and this is a great book. my 15 year old finished it in 4 days
1,This was terrible; there are so many better ones out there!,"I will tell it to you straight: this book was awful. The characters were cardboard, the plot was contrived, too much time was covered in too short a space, and everything was told rather than shown. It was like Sharon Draper was trying to cram as many issues as possible into the story and they all ended up spilling out, leaving an empty shell. In addition, so many parts were unbelievable. Like: why did the protagonist's father get visitation rights towards his daughter whom he was convicted of molesting?There are so many other, great books out there that deal with the same themes -- please look elsewhere!"
4,Just what I needed!,"If you've got your iPod to use it on your car, don't hesitate on getting this.After lots of research I finally made my mind on buying this handy accesory. I came out to be just what I needed. The FM transmitter is powerful enough to keep my audiophile ear satisfied (once you spend some time finding the best clear station in your tunner).This is getting 4 out of 5 stars because of the lack of capability to set your own presets (the QS button just gives you the chance to switch between factory set stations). The problem with the bulky power cord could easily be fixed with a little time and basic electrician knowledge to hard-wire it under your dash (keeping your lighter free).This is the second transmitter I buy and I've found it just great. If your car has a cup holder near your dash this is a must."
5,Finally a good radio transmitter,"If you are ok with the size of this item then you will love this trasmitter. It comes with all the required attachments and fits perfect in my center console cup holder. It is definatly one of the strongest transmitters I have seen on the market. Also charges the iPod, I am happy!"
3,Macally I Pod dock is the best of the bad,"The Macally I Pod dock makes the best of a bad situation. The FM spectrum in New York is completely full and Macally's full spectrum capability allows the user to scan for those few weak channels that may be available. Installation is a breeze and the controls are well located and easy to use. Some static is inevitable and I found that it originated from the other chargers (cell phone, satellite radio, ect.) sharing the cigarette lighter outlets. The only fault with the unit is that the dock compromises volume somehow. Even setting the volume controls on the radio and I Pod at full only produces about 75% available volume. Using my ten year old cassette tape adapter with my I Pod, in my older Ford van, is still king. It provides full volume and static free music. Macally still provides this best, if still flawed, FM dock option."
1,Terrible book,"I am working on my Master's degree and was assigned this book for a research class. This book is excruciatingly boring with unnecessarily long sentences, passages, and chapters. I would not recommend this book for anyone. A more concise and readable book on this subject must exist. Get that one instead."
3,Fun but not worth the money,"This game is good, but the quality is way out of line with the cost. The game costs (...) for the PC and no, it is not worth it. Basically, Loopy Landscapes adds new scenery, ""themes"" and rides. Unlike RCT 2's expansions, Loopy Landscapes actually added truly new rides, not just rethemes. Loopy Landscapes is a fun way to expand your time on RCT 1 but it isn't worth the money -- plus, it's very challening, perhaps TOO challenging!"
3,Good Cosplay,"Pros:Great for cosplayingBest Itachi necklace I've seenCons:QualityI love this necklace great for cosplaying, but one of the rings unsnapped. I was able to put everything back together with super glue."
5,House Calls and Hitching Posts,"If you enjoy reading and learning about the Amish, you will enjoy this book."
3,O.K. But be careful!,"This product changed my bladder problems from bad to better, but I still have flow problems.The main thing is that a full 6 tablets caused me to have spells of disorientation. I take no drugs, so it wasn't a compatibility issue. I now take 1 in the morning and two at bedtime with no ill effects. The full dose of 2 three times daily caused me problems.I am 68 and a major cancer survivor, but I don't think that affected it.TaosGuy"

4,New Way to Think About Relationships,"This book is a definite ""should read"" on the list of anyone considering how to reach out to build a deeper and more intimate community. It addresses how we validate or invalidate ways for people to belong, even without knowing it. While the book does not provide ""the answer"", which I appreciate, it does give a whole new prospective with which we can figure out how to address people belonging to our relationships."
4,My Search to Understand Community has Ended,"Joseph Myers offers a comprehesive, yet simple understanding for humanity's need of community. As a church planter, The Search to Belong was instrumental in helping us frame our small group methodology in a way that was both theological and practical."
2,Cheap,Kind of cheaply made but the kids like it so that's all that matters really. Wish there was a R2D2 costume to go with it that was for older kids not just infants.
1,E Unibus Plurum,"Take out a quarter and look at the other motto besides 'In God We Trust'.It says in Latin: E pluribus unum = out of many, one.This book unwittingly, but as accurately pegged by a prior reviewer, flip-flops the motto and has that represent theMosaic of Christian Beliefs:E unibus plurum = out of one, many.What we have here is a sacrifice of Unity of Christian Truth to the Diversity of Academic Freedom and Theological License.Jesus said clearly, 'Thy Word is Truth', NOT 'truths', and especially NOT 'what you think is truth (A) and what I think as truth (non-A) so long as we agree to disagree even on some fundamental doctrines.'See the book 'Across the Spectrum' for how far this Mosaicism notion gets carried among some hyper-imaginative devangelicals."
5,What Service!,Arrived before was suppose to. Works great. Will definately come here again if need anymore. Thanks.
1,H is for Horrible,"My 5 year old brought this book home from the public school library. As I started to read it, I got chills. The words and the pictures are designed to get down deep into your spirit. It is definitely not a cute little way for young kids to remember their ABCs. Beware!"
1,T is for Terrible,Be careful! The graphic details of horrible acts and images of demons may not be something that you would want your 4 -8 year old to conjure up when they think of their ABCs.
5,Smooth and quiet,"Moderate weight, good quality, nice looking. Shower curtains slide easily on the curtain rod and makes little noise."
3,"overpriced garbage from china, break easily, work OK",I barely put any strain on one of the rings and it broke. The little rollers do work pretty well though. Very overpriced. See if you can get them somewhere else.
5,As smooth as butter!,These curtain rings look very utilitarian and plain. Their beauty is hidden in their function. They roll as smooth as butter and are quiet. I will always have this type of curtain ring from now on.
1,junk!,"watch broke a few months after i bought it, it was not the first sieko 5 ive had that broke so i wont be getting anymore."
4,A collection of love songs from The Chieftains and some VERY SPECIAL guests,"The Chieftains refuse to stagnate in their musical career, and this special-guest-filled albums proves that once again. This is an aboslutely all-star collection of traditional Irish songs sung by outstanding female vocalists such as Mary Chapin Carpenter, Diana Krall, Natalie Merchant, Joni Mitchell, Sinead O'Connor, Joan Osborne, and Bonnie Raitt. The fact that this band can collaborate with musicians ranging from country to rock to pop to Asian proves their musical genius."
2,THE FIRST BAD ONE,"I love the Chieftains and I listened to this album 6 times - I was sure there had to be SOMETHING to redeem it, but I was wrong. It is probably the only stinker they have ever recorded. Virtually every song is boring. Judging by the material, I believe it would appeal to certain Doc Marten-wearing female college sophomores who have just discovered a type of aggressive feminism. Paddy Moloney always celebrated the fact that Irish music was fabulously malleable and could fit with any type of music - that's probably right for the MUSIC, but in this case, unfortunately, the music is only fair and he ignored the content."
1,Great Disappointment,"What a waste of money! The whole CD is a disappointment. The songs all lack emotion, and the singers do not perform at their best. This is certainly one to pass up."
3,Not the Chieftains' best work,"Don't get me wrong, this is a pretty decent album with some really good cuts. But overall its sort of another Celtic Woman album, not a Chieftains one. They've done better.The Magdalene Laundries (Joni Mitchell) is outstanding though."
3,British horse story,"Horsecrazy Jinny Manders is thrilled when her father, a disillusioned social worker, moves his family from the city to a tumbledown ruin of an old house in rural Scotland. Her bliss turns back into dreaming when she falls in love with an abused circus mare, a spectacular chesnut Arabian, who has escaped into the wilderness surrounding Jinny's new home.Very solid horse story (which means of course it's pretty unlikely, that's the whole point), strong action, vivid writing. British social attitudes of the 1970's lend it a slightly baffling feel to a modern American (or, probably, anyone else)"
5,GREAT BOOK!!!,"One of the best series I have ever read, I have the whole collection of the ""Jinny"" books & highly reccomend them for everyone to read!!!"
5,This is a wonderful book!,"This is such a great book! It's the first of a series, and every one is great. Every horse lover is sure to enjoy them!"
5,I've loved you so long,"great story, problem it is in French, the French apparently abhor dubbing English language in their movies, too bad."
3,"Acting very good, story not believable or compelling","THERE IS A SPOILER: As good an actor as K. Scott Thomas is, this is still a story of a very depressed woman, and the eventual explanation does not really satisfy. The movie is done very well, interesting shots of the sister's life and friends, but ultimately feels like a waste of time to find out that ... SPOILER ALERT ... a child's illness and death brought out a woman's self-destructive urges. It's also hard to believe that anyone would get 15 years in Europe for euthanizing a child in severe pain who had only days to live. Murderers get less. What you are left with is a study of depression without a compelling story, though clearly that is what the director wanted."
3,clothes dryer umbrella style,"THIS ITEM IS GOOD FOR AN OCCASIONAL USAGE. NOT TO BE USED FOR EVERYDAY USE BECAUSE IT WON'T TAKE THE WEIGHT AND CONSTANT UP AND DOWN. THE ALUMINUM STRUTS ARE MINIMAL IN STRENGTH. IF YOU ARE GOING TO USE THIS SEVERAL OR MORE TIMES A WEEK, SPEND THE EXTRA BUCKS AND GET A HEAVY DUTY MODEL. THEY ARE OUT THERE. SHOP AROUND."
3,Flimsy Components But works OK,"I am somewhat dismayed at the flimsy components used on this product and doubt if it will last that long exposed to the elements. It would seem they have used cheap components to keep the costs down!Having said that, I set it up, cemented in the post per instructions and have used it several times. I can dry a lot of clothes in a small space.I will have to store it when not in use due to the poor quality components but I guess for the price it will suffice!If you can afford a little more, buy something better, if you are on a tight budget like me, go ahead and buy it."
4,Convenient and portable,"This clothesline holds almost two large loads of laundry. It rotates in the breeze, and the clothes dry quickly. In the winter, I fold it up like an umbrella and store it out of the way in the garage. I've used mine at least two years, and it's still as good as new."
4,Holds tons of clothes,Great item for thE price. Could be made a little more robust. I have a feeling if it fell over it would break in 2 so make sure your install is solid. Overall a decent product for what your paying for it
1,Don't waste your time,"Had this item for approximately 6 months and it broke in a stiff wind. Granted it had clothes on it, so I purchased a more expensive one and paid shipping on it and it has lasted me a whole two months. We don't live in a very windy area and I don't over load the thing. I've contacted the vendor for a resolution, and am still looking for a reliable product ..."
4,Life Saver!!,"I bought this when My husband and I moved into a new house..... We didn't have an electric dryer yet so I was using those inside drying stands.They make your clothes stiff :-(So I bought the Household essentials 12- line outdoor umbrella-style clothes dryer!! It arrived very quickly and was easy to essemble and install. I poured the cement and everything myself without needing my husbands help and everything seems to be holding up nicely, so the directions are easy to follow. I have had 3 loads on this at once with one being a load of heavy towels and mine the dryer has supported the weight just fine. All in all it is a great product for a very good price."
3,Works well for the price,"Could not find one of these outdoor umbrella dryers locally, so searched Amazon and found one, cost was around 56 bucks with shipping, I believe. I already had the ground pipe from an earlier unit, so did not have to go through the hassle of digging and cementing. The cords are somewhat loose, but can be tied shorter easily. The opening mechanics are simple, but I lubed the pole with a wax-based bicycle chain lube and it slides much easier than without. This is a Chinese product so I do not expect much. I don't leave it out in bad Oregon weather (rain) so I think it will do well. If it lasts four to five summers, then I will be happy. Delivery time from the vendor was good."
4,"Hey, It Works!","This item is a little hard to set up, but once this obstacle is overcome, it works like a charm. We have had ours up since last winter, and are very happy with it. The only thing is, it isn't overly strong, so don't use it on very windy days. One of the supports bent because of strong winds."
4,ok,"While this product may not be of the highest quality materials, it seems to function ok and performs as advertised. It might not last for 20 years but serves the purpose we purchased it for and at the price was a pretty good value."
1,great graphics..bad game,"When are game developers going to realize it takes more than graphics to make a great game? ""Eye candy"" is all this game has to offer. The game play was just so-so, certainy nothing you can't find in just about any other shooter with the exception of being able to move in all three dimensions (no loop or roll though). The ""story"" is lame and uninvolving. The accents and voices the ""actors"" use are so bad I had to turn the sound off during dialog. There is simply no reason to buy this game with so many other much better choices out there."
3,Didn't like the taste,Tried this for a day or two but the lingering taste made me feel a bit sick. Didn't do much for my sinuses either. The instructions note that it's not recommended for people with digestive issues.
5,Awesome G25 Racing Wheel,"I am a 63-year-old who has owned a couple of sports cars, but have never been into computer gaming. I purchased the G25 expressly for use on iRacing.com and have been very very pleased with the results. Very solidly build unit. The tactile feedback from the wheel is particually impressive, especially when tuned to feel like the real car. The shifter is a bit wimpy, but merely a matter of getting used to the feel. Have not tried the paddle shifters."
4,Overall good wheel,I like it a lot. I don't use the shifting console but wheel and peddles are very smooth and linear. The only thing I don't like is that it centers slightly off center. There may be a way to adjust this but I haven't tried to look yet
4,good wheel,"I got this wheel mostly to play GTR2 and Gran Turismo. However, I pretty much only use it on the PC now and never use the PS2 anymore. GTR2 is that good. As for the wheel, it works great. The pedals feel much better than my old Wingman Formula Force and the construction of it all is way better as well. My only complaint about it is the lack of more buttons on the wheel. There are only two. The gearshifter has plenty of buttons to program but it would be much better if some of those were relocated to the wheel."
4,"little more refinment and it will be ""good""","I will start by saying that this setup is half excellent half ok.The steering wheel and force feedback are the best there is,The gas and break pedal have a nice range of sensitivity,and are made of aluminum.Now for the ""ok"" part.The H-Pattern shifter has no guides like a real car,so it is a little difficult to hit the right gear in the heat of a race.Sequential shift is easy enough.The unit also feels fairly solid to me.Now for my least liked part of the whole setup.The Clutch pedal,I do not know if it's the games or that sensor.I play race 07 and GTR 2 with this and about 90% of the clutch pedal is useless.It feels like an on/off switch at the very bottom of travel.If I turn sensitivity down in the control setup I no longer can use the clutch for neutral.Very unhappy about this part.over all I like this setup,BUT if I had known about the clutch part of this I would have gone with something cheaper."
3,G25 racing wheel review,"I paid $18 for shipping on Amazon and never got my product after 9 days. Somebody lost it. It shipped again, and I didn't get credit for the high shipping fee. G25 is nice and works, but even though it's advertised to work with Vista, the CD software was for XP. I had to go to the internet (not in instructions) to find Vista Version. (Since this is only a game PC it wasn't connected to the internet, so I had to download to hard drive, make a CD and transfer the software to the Vista machine.) This is a $300 wheel, and Vista has been out for a long time!Then it ships with a free trial racing game that has the Logitech lable on CD and G25 pre-set software. Only the pre-set software doesn't work, and a call to Tech support can't help. Unable to play racing game sent with Logitech G25 wheel. I'm not a happy customer.MaxPI"
4,LOGITECH G25 RACING WHEEL SET,"Item is well constructed of metal and leather and of course, plastic. Seems to be a solidly made set. A strong and heavy table is a must. One can forget it is not a real steering wheel attached to a 2 ton car. Force feedback adds to the realism. Only negative is the stick shifter. Paddle shifters are a better choice for most players as the stick tends to be very vague with poor ""gates"". Overall a solid value.RS"
4,"In places, outstanding","""Maria,"" ""Nothing Is Real but the Girl,"" ""Double Take,"" ""Divine,"" and so many other songs on this album are worth listening to time and time again. I only have a few requests: 1) Blondie, please make several more albums, and release any old material that you've been holding onto for whatever reason. 2) Does anyone know anything about a supposed biography that is due, entitled ""Platinum Blonde""? I've been reading Debbie Harry's ""Making Tracks"" and it is startling and fantastic. I would absolutely love to read more about Ms. Harry, preferably from an authoritative source. Please email me at twuebker@cctr.umkc.edu if you know of anything."
3,"The eclectic style is admirable, but results as a bit thin.","This is a solid offering for a group that hasn't been together for so long. Still, the Autoamerican syndrome survives on this one--too many styles to feel like a whole lot more than a demo reel. I'm a big fan, so I'll still be there for the next one, but I hope that Blondie can defeat the burning desire to spread themselves too thinly over too many styles for the next album."
3,a pointless excursion,"all the hype in the world won't disguise the fact this is an ill-conceived project. No Exit sees Blondie trying on every musical style they know, as if they believe all the p.r. about their 'incredible musical skills'. They've also had 16 years to come up with some killer songs, and the best they can do is a cover!! (Out in the Streets, a 60s composition that sounds fresher than just about everything else) It's not a disaster, but their much-vaunted 'versatility' has not stood them in good stead. And when are they going to rerelease Jimmy Destri's classic solo album??!!"
2,No Exit,"There are a few good tracks, especially ""Screaming Skin"", ""Nothing is Real..."" and ""Maria."" Other than these, it seems as if Blondie didn't learn anything from their last album ""the Hunter."" The album is sabotaged by weak experiments with too many different genres. Having said this, it's still better than, or at least holds it own against, most of the junk that passes for popular music today."
3,Does Mr. Bohacz Really Know?,Carb vs. SMPI... You can't turn a sow's ear into a silk purse.This book is helpful to to one who is not familiar with the more intricate points of carbureation. For a good basic understanding of Demon carb. an excellent choice.
4,Not their best,"This song is Hottness and it's not even their best work. This single is perfect for a ""coming out"", These two ladies are here to stay. Anyone saying they can't sing hasn't heard the debut album...listen to that and you know these girls got pipes. And they write their songs...These girls aren't going anywhere and you'll realize this when you stop judging from ONE released song. OnlyNinaSky.com FALL BACK!"
2,Sloppily written,"At one point in about the middle of this book, Adler writes, ""In the early 1980s, there were two more New Yorker crises. One arose out of pieces by Janet Malcolm; the other from an article of my own. My own arose first.""She then proceeds to discuss these two crises, and it becomes clear that the period of time she is discussing is not trhe ""early 1980s"" at all, but a period stretching from the middle of that decade into early in the 1990s.Even more confusingly, a couple of sentences later, getting into the discussion of one of these crises, she writes, ""In 1995, at the federal courthouse in Manhattan, two libel trials were running simultaneously."" She means Westmoreland's and Sharon's. But it was in 1985 that those two trials coincided. Not the ""early 1980s"" really, and not 1995, certainly! So her timing contradicts itself and both statements are as it hapens wrong.That is a sample of the extreme factual sloppiness, as if from a book dashed off in a great hurry."
5,Gunless the Anti-western Western,"This sweet li'l western is my favorite. There's a morality tale involved, but it doesn't clobber one over the head. Paul Gross is awesome!!! I so want to see him do more westerns. Sienna Guillory is gutsy and gorgeous and the rest of the cast are equally competent. If you liked Due South, you'll probably like seeing how Paul Gross has matured. I'd buy it again."
4,"Fun, Easy Going Entertainment","My husband, a die-hard Western fanatic, and I just stumbled across this movie in a discount bin recently and bought it. We had not heard of Paul Gross before. We were pleasantly surprised at how much we enjoyed the movie and have watched it more than once since its purchase. The movie does not take itself too seriously as a western. The characters are fun to watch and we enjoyed the humor. This is a great movie for people of all ages. Buy it and you just might find yourself watching it again and again."
3,Quirky Canadian western,"This is an odd and unpredictable, almost anti-Western film made by those quirky Canadians. It takes place some time in the northwest, not quite the wild west, and features a town whose inhabitants would rather not use guns even though a gunslinger who arrives would like to do just that."
4,Touring Italy makes me want to go there now,"This video shows you all of the cities and towns you'd want to remember after a trip to Italy. I was fortunate to have gone there twice. It gives you some historical background in an entertaining, and enjoyable way. The scene of the ancient Roman soldiers on the march can make you laugh out loud. And the scenery is fantastic but, of course, with Italy as a subject, why wouldn't it be? This video is for anyone who's been to Italy, or who dreams of going."
3,Off the Wall!,"Scanned through the book and could not find very many recipes that actually seemed like they were for diabetics! At least none that my brother (the diabetic, stage two) would enjoy."
3,I have diabetes,And I have tried several of this kind of books. So far they tell me how to eat the same only with slightly reduced carbs. On my own I have learned how to combine both a diabetes and a heart healthy diet with better food choices.
1,REDUNDANT BOOK,"There is absolutely nothing new in this book that cannot be gleaned from Ken Hanke's book. This book is redundant. It is weak and effete compared to Hanke's opus, and it is not worthy to sit next to it on the same shelf"
2,Reading this book was like digging a hole in gravel,"I started this book with a lot of enthusiasm. I'm an Edison fan and figured I'd give it a go. But after the first 50 pages, I could not go on. The author's writing style made this book almost unreadable...and I have a master's degree. So it should have been a fun, easy read, right? Um. No. After run-on sentence after run-on sentence, each mixing sometimes three and four thoughts that would have to be re-read over just to come to some kind of understanding as to what was being referred to, and in the process, coming to some kind of conclusion that would lead one, impulsively, it could be argued, to start thinking in those terms, albeit wrong. So basically, the ENTIRE book is written like the crazy sentence that preceded this one. Get the idea? The author obviously did a lot of work. The editor must have been playing Tetris non-stop while proofing the manuscript. Yikes. Avoid."
4,Great accent light for little cost,I recently purchased these lights for a display case. It produces a nice light with out the hassle of wires or drilling. It mounts very easily.
3,what I thought of product,The lights were very easy to install but they weren't as bright as I expected. I used them under the counters in my kitchen.
1,Batteries die almost instantly!,"I bought these for lighting up jewelry cases in my store. Had them on for one full shift, about 9 hours, and the lights dimmed significantly- with brand new batteries. They're still ""on"" so technically the batteries haven't died. But the light is so dim it's like they're not even on, and they don't light up the merchandise 12"" away from the light source. I can't afford to replace the batteries (or have to charge them) every day! I would NOT recommend these to anyone."
5,Excellent LED lights. They DO include batteries!,"Great for under-counter, or any dark corner. Easy to put up, and to adjust. Lights actually have two strengths: tap once for ""low"", and again for ""high"".I am going to buy more of these for additional locations.Also, you can install with a screw, or the included ""velcro"" patches. Nothing easier!For some reason, both the ad AND the package say ""batteries NOT included""---but they are!"
2,Rite Lite LPL623W 5 LED Puck Light 3 Pack - White,"Sticky tape mount does not stick well to wooden surfaces, and I suspect it would not work on drywall, too. The light itself is a little bit flimsy, and falls off the wall very easily when you grope for it in the darkness. And then battery compartment opens and batteries pop out and scatter around, so better be careful."
4,Inexpensive Ambience,Doesn't provide enough light to be useful...better used to provide low-lighting to add ambience to a room. Batteries seem to last quite awhile. Good price though for whatever use.
3,lights,"These little lights work fine for small spaces. The light is bright white and has two settings for brighter or dimmer. We put them in a couple of closets, and while not the most illuminating, they serve their purpose."
4,Works pretty well,"I bought these for a couple of odd spots around the house that always seemed too dark - under the kitchen sink, the corner part of my countertop, that oversized closet, etc. They stick on easily (peel the liner from one side of the sticker, attach to unit, peel away the other side of the sticker, attach to surface) and seem to hold pretty well (good sized, very sticky sticker). They turn on easily (just push) and have 2 settings. I do wish they were a little brighter, though. They are great for the under sink area (now I can find the dish detergent) and I can see all over the cabinet. Just so-so for the kitchen countertop though.UPDATE: After about a month mounted under a kitchen cabinet, one of these fell off (and adhered really well to the granite countertop). We remounted it under the cabinet. I'll let you know if it stays put."
3,One led is a dud....,"Well one of the four led lights does not work on one of the units. I've actually only turned on two of the three because I'm short on batteries. They're good for small spaces though, and I love having no cord."
4,good quality,"I've tried a few different brands of puck lights. These were not my favorite out of the box, but they have proven to be of solid quality (my favorite out of the box ended up falling apart at the smallest impact). Their only negative is that the adhesive isn't that great. But I haven't found any puck lights that have good adhesive. The light can be angled, which is a nice feature, and can be mounted with screws as well. There are two levels of brightness (low and high) that you can cycle through.Overall, I do like these - much more than I thought I would initially. I keep them around, unmounted, and use them as needed around the house. They are portable and don't break - two great qualities."
4,Great LED Puck Lights,"This 3-pack puck lights are decent looking and produce much better light output than my previous pucks. It requires 3 ""AAA"" batteries for each puck. The dimmer is actually a 2-step dimming function. First press of the button will give you its brightest setting, the second press will dimmed out the output halfway, if you press it again the third time, it will turn off the lights.There are 5 white LEDs that are evenly distributed around the puck. This LEDs are much better compared to the older types that produce a ghoulish bluish white color. It also has a frosted reflector that diffuses the light.Made in China.Pros:+ Bright+ Adjustable. It rotates and tilts at the same time.+ 2-step dimming.+ Comes with its own perfectly pre-cut Velcro which covers the entire surface at the back.Cons:- No auto-shutoff- Batteries are not included.Overall, great product."
4,Excellent help,"Helps a lot to understand raw's particularities and improves the ""handling"" of raw files.Very good indeed"
3,Believe It or Not...,"If you are unfamiliar with the name ""Abu Ghraib"" then you shouldn't even be reading this review or considering this film for viewing. I would suggest getting some, less graphic information about this situation before venturing on.I don't think anyone denies the attrosities that happened in this prison/interegation station. I think the only things that are still somewhat hidden/denied/ignored are the names behind the exact horrors and the depth of knowledge (of these actions) by those who should have been on top of every detail.Be prepared for the real nitty-gritty. This documentary is not meant for an after-dinner social hour and certainly not for children, those who are squeemish or those people who are proud of the actions (or lack-there-of) of then President Bush, his Staff, our Government Officials and a few Generals.Be prepared for some hard-core, hard hitting facts with picture proof."
4,Open your ears and your feet will follow...,"While I appreciate and agree with the ""music fan from New York"",regarding the general assessment of this CD,they neglected to mention one very important aspect. Not only does this band give new life to the selected ""old standards"",but 7 out of the 12 tracks are originals which hold their own against any similar styles out there. Fans of Leon Kittrell's soulful vocals coupled with this unique ensemble of songwriter/artists will be pleased to know that the band is already at work on their next CD,which will have a slightly different feel,but with the same incredible energy,originality and verve."
3,Quick read,"I wanted to get a book to teach me the basics. This did the trick and was an easy read. Overall it does what I expected. I could use more techncical details, but that is for the engineer in me."
3,A little too depressing,"A handful of these stories are very good, but be aware that overall this is not a happy collection. To say it gently, there is not much here that is uplifting (and I know that is not what makes something good literature, but at least throw us a bone now and then). After finishing the majority of the stories, you pretty much want to kill yourself."
1,....As if I had nothing in my ears!,"My intent was to use these earplugs to block out the neighbors' loud music on weekends. However, the first time I tried these, I barely noticed a difference with the earplugs in or out. I feel like this purchase was a waste of my money..."
3,good but...,"As a musician, I am not in the least interested in 'The Struggle' or 'Solidarity' with anyone.I want to get rich and impress the girls. Live fast, belch hard and ultimately pass on to the great yonder in a great big comfy house surrounded by adoring children, a loving wife and concubines.I can't do this in the socialist utopia of Mat Callahan's dreams. If I can't do it here, it's my own problem and responsibility which I accept whole-heartedly.When the industry is run by sharks, learn about sharks. When the industry is changing as rapidly and unpredictably as it is today, relax and just keep writing the best damn songs you can.What I really like about the book is when he talks about the physicality of music. He's on to more than he knows there, and should toss the 'free us from Babylon' politics and chase that thread with vigour."
5,Excellent! A SoCal bride's first absolute necessity!,"This book is exactly what I wanted when I first got engaged, but it took me a few weeks to find it. I have only lived in LA for 2 years and knew there were so many more wedding and reception locations than were advertised in magazines and phone books, and I was right. This book lists each and every place in Southern California with extremely detailed facility descriptions, pricing structures, restrictions, what's included, and interesting information and trivia about some of the places. Everything is here, from 5 star hotels to remote locations where you bring-your-own everything. This book is an absolute must for the couple who wants a wedding and/or reception location that fits their style exactly. The only drawback is that there are so many places to choose from, it will take longer than you might have expected to finally choose a location!"
4,Two of the absolute best B-sides yet from any PSB single!,"And yes, I suppose ""YOTMYLMWYD"" is alright too, I suppose. I really only buy these import maxi singles for the b-sides, not to mention the enhanced video that many of them feature as well. However, this video is, even by PSB standards, just plain weird. I guess what it's trying to say that, at both the beginning and the end, there are numerous couples lying down together (All drunk? Could be), with them all dancing in the middle portion. The real highlight of this single is of course, the excellent techno-dance tune ""Lies"". Disposable? I hardly think so, former reviewer. You probably haven't been a fan of this duo for as long as I have to realize that it's their style. As for ""Sail Away"", it really sounds like the definitive tune to be played on any sea cruise, for it's soothing qualities. So, until their next single, keep on dancin' to the cool beat of the Pet Shop Boys!"
3,Good songs hurt by deaf recording engineer.,"Agree with 2 of the other 4 reviewers. Willie is an excellent performer and is as captivating live as on studio releases. This one recording, however, has horrible recording settings/levels. A live CD is capable of much better quality than this. In fact, there are other live recordings of Willie with much better sound and most of the same songs. I suggest ""Live From The Streets Of New York"", which has ~most~ of the album of the same name, recorded live, or else ""Live-Hard Times In The U.K."", which is also good.The low grade is entirely due to the poor recording, not intended as a slam on the very talented Mr. Nile. If the sound was better, this would be a 4 or 5 star album."
3,Bite sized bits of an interesting story,"I had thought this would be an in-depth history of the coast of GB. Instead, it is a fluffy - fun skip around the coast with a few interesting tid bits thrown in. It is really more of a tourism piece. There is nothing particularly wrong with the series, it just isn't substantial enough to hold ones attention for more than a few episodes."
4,Occult thriller and spys...,"This novel isn't for the faint of heart or those with a weak stomach. As it alternates from an occult thriller to a euro-thriller with a solid female heroine Mossad agent who teams up with a brooding detective, the body count rises and rises.It takes some getting used to as it alternates between stylized gothic and lean and mean crime thriller writing, but the pacing holds you and it becomes an interesting balance. It reminded me more of Thomas Harris and Hannibal than Dan Brown, but it's crazy to compare writers, anyway.If you like a unique origional story filled with a cross-section of Vatican conspiracy, ritual abuse, and even mind control ... give it a shot."
5,Refreshing and reassuring!,"As parenting ""manuals"" go, this book is really a breed apart. It offers a realistic and upbeat attitude, and it's easy and quick to read. Using other parents' anecdotes as well as her own, Samalin provides a level-headed, big-picture perspective that is often humorous and always comforting. Even if you're just expecting your second child, this book is useful because it opens with chapters on preparing older siblings for the arrival of a new baby. Wish I'd read this one a few years ago. Highly recommended!"
4,A great interpretation,"This is the first CD I bought from Harmonia Mundi, and I am not disappointed, by far, by the quality of the interpretation. It may seem sometimes not to be the right tempo (a little slow), but the overall quality is very good. I will just regret that the quality of the sound capture is not as good as it could have been.A great CD."
4,A Look at a View of a Vietnam War Pilot!,"Pretty interesting view from a Vietnam War era pilot. Technical stuff lost me, but story is intriguing and eye opening. Makes one appreciate those men (and women) who served our country during this terrible war and reveals the anxiety and fears they fought on their missions. I also was intrigued by the dedication and concern each pilot had for his fellow pilots who were shot down or captured by the enemy. I think more men would enjoy the book rather than women."
4,Great book for the military aviation enthusiast...,"...although I think his second book ""Palace Cobra"" was better than this one. This is definitely a book for the military aviation enthusiast. It's technical without being boring, and really gives a pilot's perspective of the Vietnam air war."
4,Promising Gaming Keyboard,Very capable macro keyboard with a few major limitations:- Keyboard lighting at any setting is too dim- Keyboard tilt angle is too shallow- Some keys tended to stick (but seem to work after exercise)Using in conjunction with Fang keypad. Seem to work well together.Used for World of Warcraft.
5,G11 vs New G15 keyboard,"I'm a serious gaming fool and was dismayed to see the New G15 board had reduced the number of programable keys from 18 to 6 as opposed to the ""old"" G15 The programable keys are the heart of the board, able to record macros as well as any key action. I am happy again to see that the G11 is the ""old"" G15, with all 18 keys intact. To me, the New G15 only offers eye candy at the cost of the best advantage the G11 ( and the Old G15) have, the number of keys to program. Apparently Logitech saw the error of it's ways and is keeping the old board alive under a new name. My guess is that the New G15 will fade away and the G11 will live on."
3,"Good design, made cheap","I have had mine for almost 3 years of heavy gaming and over all I have enjoyed it very much. The stand-pegs on the back underside raised it enough when I cared for that, and the skirt that snaps to the front provide slight support for those extended game sessions.My gripes: The left Shift key started working intermittently about a year ago. Tough getting use to using the right one, but I overcame that. Then the ""C"" key went, then the "","" key. I had hoped this would last Much longer.Over all, nice button layout, features, and experience in use. I understand I could have received a slow lemon, so that won't necessarily prevent me from getting another keyboard from Logitech. Just disappointed in this one."
5,"great keyboard, recommended","This keyboard is awesome!! Highly recommend it. Little bigger then standard cause of G keys, but the features and look and feel of keys is spectacular. Love love love. Keys are removable if you accidentally spill coffe on it and get it sticky :)"
3,Nice keyboard but the software does not always work,"The gaming keys are useful not only for games The problem is that the software to enable them based on the application running does not always work. This is the case with UltraCompare, for example. After the program is launched, the keys do not work initially but after a couple of tries they do."
1,STOPPED WORKING AFTER 3 WEEKS,I HAVE HAD THIS KEYBOARD FOR 6 WEEKS AND THE HOTKEYS RANDOMLY STOP WORKING. I TRIED INSTALLING THE SOFTWARE AGAIN BUT THE PROBLEM CONTINUES. I PAID A LOT OF MONEY FOR A KEYBOARD THAT I BAUGHT SPECIFICALLY FOR THE HOT KEYS AND NOW I AM STUCK WITH AN EXPENSIVE PAPER WEIGHT KEYBOARD. IT LOOKS COOL BUT DIDN'T HOLD UP TO THE LOGITECH REPUTATION.
2,Very disappointing,"The book gives a good overall description of the Golden. However, there are few specifics. I was looking forward to the section on housebreaking. It was ONE paragraph long. If you are looking for a book to help you decide what kind of pet to get-- this may be for you. If you are looking for a book to learn about the dog that you already have or will be getting soon-- this is not for you. I will be looking for a second book on this fabulous breed."
3,A review of the book on tape,"For once this was an abridgment to a book that was read on tape in which I didn't feel like something important was left out.Unfortunately, the plot and the characters were only so-so. Jerry O'Connell read the story - and at first I thought that would be a big plus since I've liked most of the stuff that he has done. However, this time I was not impressed. Not his best work.Nolan Kilkenny, who should be known as 'the one man army' based on his unstoppable one man performances against several teams of battle-tested, better-armed former Russian Special Forces throughout the book, is a tiresome character. Many of the supporting characters were much more interesting and I would have preferred it if some of them would have had a greater role throughout the book.I give this one a grade of C+."
3,If you are interested in Irish Whiskey,"If you are interested in Irish Whiskey, and I am, this book is a wonderful addition to your library. It has it facts correct. It has interesting little tidbits of unusual information."
5,Good stuff,"I'd rather fend off the bugs than come down with West Nile virus.We used this product on a recent camping trip and found it to be safe and effective.With Off you can camp out, without a net encasing your entire camp site, and without mosquito netting hats.Go camping, and put on some Off. Enjoy the woods and the open air."
4,Best for clothing,"There are many different types of insect and many different types of mosquito. Some will be repelled by 10% DEET while others will bite through canvas hammocks to get at you. Obviously no repellent will work for every single insect out there, so it's basically a question of trying to improve the odds in your favor. In my experience of being outdoors in the Sierra Nevada mountains, 40% DEET cream is needed to protect exposed skin, while in other parts of the world 80% DEET or stronger is needed - and even then there are insects that just don't seem to care what you are trying to repel them with. They are hungry and you are lunch, and that's it. The 23.8% spray is great for covering your clothes, because you can't really rub cream onto your pants (well, you can but it's not economical). So if you combine the use of this spray on clothing with a cream at 40% or stronger for your exposed skin, you should do pretty well in most day-hike conditions."
4,They don't write em like this anymore,"The King of Time is the best of that wacked out genre we call the manifesto. Khlebnikov imagines a future that is half socialist utopia, half bladerunner. The most outlandish idea might be the transparent glass spheres stacked up like bee hives in which we would live if old Velimir had his way. What makes this work a palatable read is that it's heavy on imagining new ways of social interaction but light on theorizing -- the guy's got concrete, if bizarre, ideas. Add to this enough exclamation marks to choke a donkey and you get something akin to Marx's Communist Manifesto -- only this time, it's in technicolor. Of all the crazy stuff coming out of Russia during and after the Bolshevik revolution, this work most clearly conveys the enthusiasm of artist-politicos in their attempts to reorder society. If you think ""communist"" is a bad word, read The King of Time -- it'll give you a new perspective."

Quand Vivi Walker lit dans le Sunday New York Times le portrait que brosse d'elle sa fille Siddy, metteur en scène à succès, elle la renie sur-le-champ. Afin d'aider à renouer le dialogue entre la mère et sa fille, les amies intimes de Vivi finissent par la persuader d'envoyer à Siddy son album souvenir : Les divins secrets des petites ya-ya .Siddy va alors plonger dans l'univers des ya-ya, du nom cajun que les quatre amies se sont donné lors de leur folle jeunesse en Louisiane.

2,Well ... I guess it works,"Perhaps it is because I have seen a similar product of bigger sizes. I was disappointed when I received this endpin stop. The wood pieces are 7""x2.75"" and 0.25"" thick. The endpin holes are relatively small. Therefore you need to remove the endpin rubber to use it.The craftsmanship is good. If you like a light weight design, this product might be good for you. But personally I still think $20 is too expensive.I learned the lesson to buy anything online only when the seller gives clear description of an item. A good picture is never good enough!"
2,Not what I expected,"Usually you would expect relatively smooth/vivid colors when looking at a lava lamp. This, however, comes with a dull light that gives the ""clear liquid"" a yellow glow. It has glitter in the solution and in my opinion, not enough wax. I wouldn't recommend this color scheme to anyone. The liquid is quite cloudy all the time."
3,lava lamp,Well I love these things but I really thought that it was suppose to be clear but mine came to me cloudy. I can barely make out the wonderful shapes. The price was awesome and it shipped to me right away.
2,Worked... for ahile,"The lava lamp worked great for about a month, then it started only working for the first 30 or so minutes it was turned on, after which the glob would just hover at the bottom and not rise up to the top anymore. We have tried making sure it was sitting correctly, etc, but nothing has worked in getting the lamp to function past 30 minutes. It is like the light bulb just isn't staying warm enough to cause the lava to rise anymore. Very dissapointing since this was a Christmas present for our son who had been asking for a lava lamp for a long time."
3,Eh...for $12,"My partner wanted this lamp for a Valentine's gift, so I ordered it for him. The first one arrived, and is supposed to be black ""lava"" in clear liquid. The ""clear"" liquid was VERY cloudy, and some of the lava clung to the sides of the lamp. I exchanged it for a new one, which is a lot better but not perfect. It's ok enough to keep. I should have read the reviews before ordering. If you decide to buy this lamp, be prepared to do the work of exchanging/returning it, if you're disappointed."
1,two consecutive cloudy lamps sent,"It's not exactly easy to tell the various lava lamp suppliers apart--they all claim to be ""the"" only authentic high-quality purveyor out there--but Amazon should move on from whoever is selling them their lava lamps at the moment. I'm looking at my second consecutive opaque red lava lamp as I type this. There's almost certainly some wax melting in there, but it's not as though I can see it.Lava lamps being cloudy right out of the box is an either/or thing, so if you get lucky and the ""clear"" liquid is even remotely clear, I'm sure it's a fine lamp. But the odds aren't great, as you can tell if you look for the word ""cloudy"" in these other reviews."
5,Does what a lava lamp ought to do,"My first grader wanted a lava lamp for a nightlight, and picked this particular model for its colors. He's very happy with it, and I've got to admit it can be hypnotic to watch. There's not much to a lava lamp, but this one is nicely made and it does what you want a lava lamp to do."
1,Cloudy...,"Liquid is cloudy and won't clear up. Tried the recommended ""turn off"" for 12 hours, then turn back on, 5-6 times. No luck. Too inexpensive to warrant a return (in my opinion), so just wanted to warn everyone...Bought a second one a couple weeks later (in the hope the first one was just simply a defective one) and had exactly the same problem. Do NOT buy this version of the lamp from this seller, unless a cloudy liquid is OK w you."
1,cloudy mess,arrived cloudy and never cleared up. looks like its filled with smoke. what a huge dissapointment. got immediate refund.will never buy another lamp here.
1,Cloudy and ugly,"I guess the good point is that it works and we didn't pay for it - it was a gift. The bad outweighs the good, though. The water is cloudy and kind of just plain boring. The oil is such a dark colour that it just does nothing but look like dark oil spills in murky sea water - nothing nice looking about that at all. It's been a few days and it still works. Not sure how long it will last. Thinking it will be donated soon."
4,It's a Lava Lamp,"The lamp is nice, a little shorter than my other lamp it replaced, the lava flows very smoothly. The only problem I had was that the lamp is suppose to be a clear liquid with black lava, the lava is black but the liquid is not clear but looks slightly foggy. I'm use to it now and it does not do anything to hurt the function of the lava. Nice selection of lamp colors and lava and liquid colors.08/27/12 - Lava in this lamp has started to break down. When the Lava flows up it has a lot of air bubbles in it and does not flow smoothly."
1,Doesn't Last!,"Really cool looking... for about a day!! Then it stopped working andthe ""lava"" froze. A frozen glob now. Not cool at all."
1,Cloudy,"As many others have said, the clear liquid was cloudy when it arrived. I left it on and let it run a few hours and nothing changed. So, I'll be returning this immediately, very unhappy, and purchasing one at a local store even though they don't have the one I want. Very poor quality. Don't waste your money."
3,Lava Lamp Fun,"My boy loves the lamp and it gives a cool glow, but the water is cloudy. Doesn't seem to bother him, but it does me! :)"
2,beh...,I didnt listen to most reviews on here...and im kicking myself in the butt because of it. Its cloudy. There is a way to fix this if you google it but its rather a pain. I wouldn't take the chance of having a lava lamp shipped to you.
3,"OK for Shatner fanatics, yawn for everyone else","If, like me, you're in the middle of your All-Things-Shatner fixation, you'll probably get a (mild) kick out of this. It's watchable; interesting strictly from the standpoint of watching The Shatman do something different - but whatever network passed on this pilot back in the day was probably wise to do so."
2,"Beam me away from this movie, Scotty!","I had read [...] that the TV-pilot starring William Shatner (before his Star Trek fame) was actually ""the best Alexander out there."" So, this evening my husband and I gave it a try. The cheesy music at the beginning should have been a warning. The actors didn't say their lines; they shouted them; the scenes consisted mostly of men on horseback galloping here and there; Alexander's love-interest looked ridiculously out of place with her bee-hive hairdo, false eyelashes, and thick eyeliner. In fact, everything about the movie oozed the artificiality of the 60's. My husband gave up on it after about twenty minutes, but I stuck it out for the full hour and a half. The only thing I can say in its favor is that its demise as a potential series allowed Shatner to go on to star in Star Trek. If his ""Alexander"" had been a success, we might never have known Capt. Kirk!"
2,Ever heard of Steady-Cam?,"I don't know which is worse: movies filmed using only hand-held night-vision cameras, or movies made by Quentin Tarantino.This movie started out okay, but then degenerated into the (now default) shaky-cam ""reality"" horror mode. A real chore to view, although once starting something I usually am able to sit through it. I made it through, but just barely."
5,Do you like horror?,"Unless you need tons of gore and have a ghetto surround system, you will like this movie. It has suspense and builds slowly, and the acting is well done. I thoroughly enjoyed it. It's not hostel, nor is it a cheap scifi channel horror movie. Thank God! If seen enough of those. Yawn....I was entertained, period."
2,waste of money,It was a good concept but it is nothing what you expect. I was hoping to see these freaks but never got the chance.
3,Horror movie,I did not know this place really existed. I like seeing how people up and moved in minutes. This is a violent movie.
2,Not Worth It,This movie was not very entertaining. I would not recommend it. Although it started out ok it went downhill from there. The ending was disappointing.
2,Chernobyl Diaries,It was one of those movies you look forward to and ends up being a disappointment. It was very boring.
3,I really liked it.,This movie had a pretty good story line and some scary moments. I wish I saw it in the theater.
3,Pretty Good...until the last two minutes! >.<,"This really wasn't bad - nice setup, buildup of tension, didn't show the antagonists fully until the end, fairly believable characters. I was really enjoying it and getting some scares out of it. Then you get to the last two minutes, and they ruined it. What is it about so many horror films that they cannot come up with a good ending for them? It's worth watching though if you rent it or get it cheap."
3,Pretty much what I expected,"Basic horror movie about an abondoned area, just this time in another country. No special twists or additions in my opinion."
5,chernobyl diaries,chernobyl 1986 as the worst nuclear disaster in history unfolds residents are driven from their homes in the nearby city of pripyat without enough time tograb even their precious personal belongings. over 25 years later six young vacationers and their extreme tourism guide visit pripyat to explore the ruins of the city now desolate and seemingly abandoned. but when they're forced to stay the night they soon discoverd that they may not be alone in this errie shocker.
3,"an edgy, spooky ride!","I really enjoyed the set-up of this film. Seeing the travellers ""get there"" and how it was accomplished was very plausible.This film has some great ""gotcha"" moments, and the visuals are a treat.But be forewarned......the ending leaves you wishing it had been done differently.All in all, a good scary time with a believable storyline."
2,Never Really get scary,"The trailer for this movie looks great. But when you watch, you keep waiting and expecting for it to get scary. It never really fills those expectations. The story line is great but it never fullfills the story line."
2,Not What I Was Expecting,"This film started off great but slowly sunk into pits of disappointment. Joss Whedon needs to learn how to edit himself. I will say, it was worth watching once... You never know who's going to show up."
1,Another Ultra Low Budget Disappointment,"If you didn't love Paranormal Activity, you'll probably think that this movie sucks.No Budget. No FX. Lots of flashlights in the dark. If that's your idea of action, you may like it.I thought it was a complete waste of time. Definitely not worth $3.99..."
2,story line,"I was rather disappointed in this movie, started out slow then all the action was too fast to catch sometimes. Left a lot to one's imagination and my imagination wasn't plugged in when I was watching. I don't know what I expected from it from previews but previews were better than movie. Glad I only spent the little I paid to rent rather than full theatre ticket price"
2,Very Slow Paced Movie,"I had high hopes for this film as the story and location etc. could have been so promising. Instead it felt like it took 3/4 the movie to finally get to the good stuff. I know you need to build suspense and a story but took a very long time for it. Like I said, the atmosphere and location was very eerie and creepy so they could have done so much more.One it finally got to the thrills and chills, it was pretty good.I personally would wait to rent this on OnDemand, iTunes or Red Box first to see if you think it is worth buying. I would give it about 2 1/2 stars but could do halves."
3,"Fun, more spooky than scary.","The idea of a horror movie set in Chernobyl seems very attractive, the possibilities of ghosts seem endless, but that's not really the direction this movie goes."
1,Such a disapointment. 1.5/5,"I saw this film on opening night with high expectations, i was expecting Paranormal Activity level scares but was really let down. This film is not scary nor is it fun enough to qualify as a B movie."
1,really really bad,This movie was too predictiable and overrated. I would not recommend this movie to anyone interested in horror movies. Miss it.
2,"Not engaging, not scary","The trailer for this movie led me to believe there would be a lot of creepy visuals...there aren't. The director takes more of a Blair Witch Project approach in trying to create tension and fear, which didn't work for me because random plot occurrences and continuity issues kept me from engaging. Also, for a film that was supposedly shot on location, it didn't feel any different than watching young people run around an abandoned building/in the woods in any other horror movie -- the very original and promising setting of Chernobyl establishes expectations that are not met. That said, the actors do a good job with what they have to work with. But if you're looking for a satisfying horror movie, look elsewhere."
2,Ehh,"Was nothing special, had a bunch of no name actors and actresses. Could have done without watching it. Refund please?!"
1,Boring,Made me want to fall asleep. Very boring. No good ending. Plenty of better movies out there. Don't waste your time
2,not the best...by far,Rented on instant video....first half hour was boring then its got a little better but the end was just poorly written and for lack of a better word...stupid.
1,Too bad!,"Too bad the audio didn't match what was going on! I tried and tried, I have extremely high speed Internet And it wasn't my connection at all, I watched a different movie with same settings and all was fine! Must have been just this play! Oh well better luck next time!"
2,Blah...,"Well if you have nothing else to watch this is okay I have seen much worse. It was entertaining,scary and predictable but sometimes that is all you're looking for to relax an watch a goofy horror flick."
3,Great First 3/4... Then Lame,"I found the majority of this film to be great and really entertaining. However, when the excitement picked up, the intrigue vanished."
5,The End of the World as We Know It,"I think there's a song like that - It's the end of the world as we know it - and I'm just fine.No kidding, I think things have been changing and will continue to do so even more dramatic in the future. A billion new capitalist is scary but at the same time inspirational. I like to know the challenges ahead. I'm a capitalist (American) in the land of capitalism. I just read a book called Stop Working by Rohan Hall. He makes similar predictions but shows how to benefit from this change.Change is only a bad thing if you refuse to see it. Excellent job by the author."
3,A Revealing Read,"Very informative. Numerous insights into what the future holds for us. Well worth reading, particularly if you have children or grandchildren that unfortunately will suffer the long term effects of our governments shortsightedness. A little redundant towards the end though. Read it, you'll be glad you did."
4,What can I say?,"These are good blades, although expensive. Luckily, Amazon has them at a terrific price, even cheaper than the three large discount stores."
1,"Arrgghh! Come on, guys, speak up, already!","I bought this at an HMV on Oxford Street in London, just wanting to own an interesting collector's item from the number-one Disco-Dance-Pop duo in the world, in my opinion. Was this ever a shoddy, inferior product to speak of, for sure. Clocking in at slightly under a half-hour, this barely audible conversation with Neil and Chris is not only cut off at the end, but starts up AFTER they've begun to speak! I definetly don't recommend this product to any music fan who also likes interview picture discs, as well as avid PSB fans, like I am. Apparently, the key thing to remember with the ""Batabak"", interview CD series is this: ""In some cases these interviews were not recorded under studio conditions."" That certainly rings true for this recording. Beware of Baktabak, avoid this one at all costs!"
3,Cliff note style a disappointment,"I am a past Eddings fan and have always enjoyed his plots and characters, but this book was a disappointment. He had so many characters, plots and subplots that it read like a cliff note edition of a 6 book series. I wish I had been given a chance to know the characters better and to be in suspence before he changed subplots yet again."
3,"Not the best, but not all that bad.","All I can do is to share my opinion and not judge others opinions. I liked the book, I am a fan of the Mallorean and Belgraid series. I liked this book, although it wasnt the same as the others, it had a new twist but intersting perspectives. I liked it. I say buy it, but get a used one so incase u dont like it, it would have only cost you a few dollars."
2,Suprisingly disapointed.,"I never thought I'd say I was disapointed with anything Eddings has written,but I have to now. Story is just too drawn out as it is.Thought it could have been better if written as a series as other Eddings story's are.Was actually glad to be finished with it."
1,Disappointed,"He should not write with (Leigh)! This is not his writing at all!! Very boring! This book could be written for a child's level. Don't waste your time or money, you will be disappointed."
1,The Redemption of Althalus,This is the first book I have read by David Eddings. I purchased the book at an outlet for five dollars. What a waste of money. The book starts out really great with the thief and his adventures. Everything falls flat after he meets a mysterious stranger. Eddings never develops his characters beyond this point. I got three fourths through the book before I decided to just stop reading.
2,What do we do with the leftovers?,"My impression throughout was that David and Leigh sorted through their trash bin of discarded ideas and characters (leftover from their previous series'), and used them to cobble together one-more-book. It felt eerily familiar, almost-recognizable plots and characters that were not-quite-as-well-realized as in the Belgariad or Mallorean.I completely agree with the review of January 11. Major dissapointment. I will hesitate before purchasing any future works by David and Leigh, which I regret as I greatly enjoyed the Belgariad."
4,This Book is Great,"This is a phenomenal book. Not since David Eddings' Belgariad/Mallorean series have I enjoyed a fantasy book this much. Plus it is in one volume, so, while hefty, it is manageable. Highly recommended for any fan of the age-old, good vs. Evil."
1,The worst Eddings to date,"It's obvious that David had very little or nothing at all to do with this book. After the first couple of chapters, the characters are indistinguishable from each other, and the bad guys so stupid that there's no reason to keep reading. The group of protagonists isn't even concerned about them, and with reason. If you've ever been annoyed by the cutesy, smarmy ""yes dear"" language in any of the latter Eddings books, you'll absolutely hate this one. It starts almost immediately, and only gets more prevalant. Don't waste your money on this book."
1,Not a good representation of the Eddings work,"I am a big fan of David Eddings and his wife Leigh's work. He has made it clear in author notes that they collaborated on projects for a long time now.Unfortunately, this was just painful. Too cutesy, too predictable, definitely not up to the normal standards of their work.I do not know for sure, but to me this reads more like David was less involved and possibly more of the work was done by his wife Leigh. The writing just has a different tone and flavor to it.If you are a fan of the Belgariad, the Mallorean, etc...I would skip this one."
2,Not nearly as good as the previous series',"The opening to this rather drab book has an interesting bit of cosmic irony. The protagonist (Althalus) is sent to steal a book to save the world. And here we are, decades after the Belgariad, and we have Eddings stealing ideas from other books to save his career...Unoriginal and far too long. There is not nearly enough character development that is genuinely plausible. Althalus spends 2 1/2 thousand years studying an ancient book and comes out basically the same as when he entered? Uh, no, I don't think so...Easily digestible, yet not remotely memorable. If you can get it cheaply, it won't be a complete waste of your time. But given the amount of fantastic writing out there, I would recommend looking elsewhere."
2,Mind numbingly verbose,"Hard as I tried, I just couldn't get through the entire story. However, this book is perfect for anyone with memory problems. The story is so repetitious, if you forget anything from one chapter, no worries, it'll be reiterated in any number of other chapters. In an attempt to stop the brain rot from that was setting in, I finally did something I rarely do... I skipped to the last chapter. Unfortunately, it wasn't worth the effort."
4,Yes! Yes!!,"It is always a pleasure to encounter an Eddings book, and this one is no exception. After a slightly stilted start, the book picks up both in action and in the usual Eddings crazy quilt of characters that never quite take themselves seriously. In this time of perpetually noir fiction it is a delight to read a book where the good guys win and the world is a better place for the effort.This group of characters is a little brighter and sneakier than previous efforts. And there are definitely some characteristics borrowed from other Eddings' efforts, but there is more than enough novelty to make this a worthwile read.My only regret is that it was written as a standalone novel. Eddings is one of the few authors who really do need volumes to fully develop characters, worlds, and action. They paint with a very fine brush, so this mere 700 page effort sometimes feels sketchy and jerks around a bit. But it is still a real pleasure to experience - READ IT."
1,"It doesn&#65533;t get any worse than this, does it?","I would have to say that this is one of the poorest attempts at writing I have had the misfortune of being punished with. Its hard to know where to begin. Shallow characters, rehash of old story lines and no imagination would sum up this non-epic. I wished I had read the reviews before buying this book. I could not read all of Althalus as the level of language is aimed at people under ten and I kept falling asleep."
4,A good rainy day read,"I read all the ""bad"" reviews and decided it couldn't be that bad. It wasn't. I enjoyed the book. I too have read all of the other Edding's books, and found this one entertaining. True, it had the same basic story line that most of the Eddings novels and serie's have, but the characters were just enough differant to hold my interest. You do get the feeling that the author was working on a deadline and did rush somewhat thru the plot, but they were trying to get the whole story in one book instead of five, so that is understandable. I read these type of books for entertainment, not enlightenment, so if I get several grins, and a few laughs out of the novel, its a winner. I have not enjoyed an author so much since Robert A. Heinlein, whose many books I have read many, many times. I hope the Edding's will come out with a new serie's soon. Meanwhile, I think I will reread the Belgarid."
2,Why me?,"The characters in Eddings' books say this quite often...as well as a lot of other ""cutesy"" talk. Having read all of the other series (19 books counting Belgarath, Polgara and the Codex!) it never bothered me too much...until this one. I really wanted to reach into the book and slap just about everyone. The story was interesting in some places, but I couldn't get past the weak dialog and the ""isn't that so cute"" behavior between all the good guys. It's unfortunate too, since I was a huge fan of the Belgariad/Malloreon and Elenium/Tamuli. Sorry David and Leigh, but changing the world is not enough...you have to change the dialogue too. (I also have a bit of trouble with the idea that after 2500 years nothing has changed in the world except a few borders...the societies and clans pretty much remain the same. I wondered about this with the Belgariad too, but the story was too good to make too much of it. Here I can't say the same)"
2,Tired rehash,"I agree with most of the reviews I have read that panned Redemption as being a rehash of much of what Eddings has previously written. The storyline is predictable, the characters 2-dimensional, and the dialogue at times abysmal. I personally would like to see the name Leigh disappear from the cover of future books, as I think she has been the cause of a severe dilution of talent that Eddings showed in his earlier works.Either hang up the ol' typewriter or get some fresh impetus into your story telling, David."
2,In my honest opinion,"If you've read other Eddings Books this ones really similar to polgara the sorceress.The storyline is written much the same way and the only thing really different is the names.Even the dialogue of the various people in the book sounds much like all the other books. Ie Emerald & Althalus are virtually identical to Belgarath & Polgara.If you've read all of the other Eddings books, you'll find this book tends to be predictable. If its a first eddings book you read then It will be a great read. If you've read Eddings books before don't bother, you'll be bored with this book."
1,Even good authors can turn out bad books,"I have enjoyed every one of David Eddings books until I bought this one. I have also been able to read almost every book that I have came across from cover to cover (which is well over 200) and beside one other (Weasel's Luck part of the DragonLance Saga), I was unable to finish ""Redemption."" I felt as though this book is geared more toward children. Eddings failed to create a world that is imprinted into your mind along with forgetting to make an interesting plot as well. I was only able to struggle through 300 pages of the book, before putting it down for good. It usually takes me less then a week to read a book, I quit this one after a month. So, if you are looking for a novel as good as those in the Belgariad series, look elsewhere."
1,The worst of the bunch,"The Redemption of Althalus is one of the worst books I have ever had the misfortune to have finished. I kept hoping it would get better, but from the point where Althalus calls a cat ""Emmy"" it goes progressively downhill to a silly end.This book is about as formula as it gets and you can practically see where the authors cut and pasted whole paragraphs from the Tamuli and Elenium books. The only justification I can think of for this pile of conversation salad is that David and Leigh must be under contract and are trying to get out of it.I urge other readers not to take this book as any indication of what David and Leigh are capable of, it is very inferior to other books that the duo have written."
1,I would give 0 stars if I could...,"Did anyone find this book a boring, pale, belgriad-in-one-book, predictable book? You can almost make a chart with plot lines taken from previous books, without one original idea...I'm so sorry I read/bought this book!"
2,Not up to their standards,"I'm sorry, but the Eddings' latest is not up to their usual standards. It starts out very nicely but then becomes bogged down in a very long and rather boring war. I was very, very dissappointed since they are among my favorite writers."
1,Stats don't lie,"I don't even have to review this book to show you how bad it is, just look at the ratio of reviews. At the time I'm writing this, Amazon.com has almost twice as many 1-star reviews as it does 5-star. This is Amazon, where even the most terrible books still have three times as many 5-star votes as 1-star.Everything about this book is terrible. Stay away."
2,Boring,"I picked this book up, thinking, great, for once I can sit down a read a good high fantasy with an ending in one volume. I'm so sick of ""the series that never ends"" and yeah Jordan, I'm talking to you. I was wrong. Redemption of Althalus is boring and I'll leave it at that."
4,Leitha and Andine saved it,"Well, this book is not too bad and I would give it 3 stars but Leitha and Andine deserve more. Two somewhat unlikely heroines (come on, they're usually the type of kitchen maid scrubbing dishes and deciding she wants to do more with her life so she joins a mysterious travelling band and saves the world and gets the guy) with their smart and sassy attitudes save an otherwise not so good book. Leitha, the 'witch' can read minds - something that puts people on edge and makes not just a few people squirm. Andine is a princess graced with an extraordinary voice; and we're not talking about a silvery tinkling voice. She can be very loud! Basically a motley rag-tag bunch of 'hereos' led by sort-of-good thief Althalus and his talking cat Emmy must save the world from Deiwos, a god who destroys things. Boring."
3,"""Classic"" EDDINGS","Although not as good as the Belgariad or the Elenium, it contains all you'd expect from an Edding's fantasy series; tempermentally assertive women (His Trademark!), lots of cute dialog and rapid plot development all in one nicely sized package. What a Bargain!!!"
2,disappointed,"I was looking forward to reading this book when I first bought it because I love a lot of his earlier works and the description of the story sound interesting.One of the author's strong points is his humor. But it gets extremely repetitive when the same characters making the same 'funny' remarks over and over again.Though I don't expect anything out of the ordinary for plots (fantasy novels are always good vs bad, where the bad is aiming to destroy the world, right ?) but the plot here is just too simple."
3,"Starts well, dies a poor death","Ho hum. Well, the start is very endearing and the idea of a talking cat is quite enchanting. However a book with Gods actively involved has one really serious problem... why bother? Why involve all the humans? Once 'the house' is in use the story becomes even more improbable, which is a real stretch for science fiction or fantasy. Looks like the Eddings family have other things on their mind and sticking it out to the end of the book was not a priority."
1,Extremely Dissapointing,"I have read some of the other reviews, and it seems as though I didn't read the same book as others did. I have major problems with this book, namely that it is FAR to cutesy. It reads like a bad sitcom. Honestly, I can't understand how it got published.Without giving anything away, I'll say that the characters are very one-dimensional, they have no depth whatsoever, and that really hurts this book. Edding's prior books (I've read and liked them all) had much better developed characters. Perhaps he should stick to series books, he seems to have a much better time with those. I mean honestly, I can tell you far more about Garion and Sparhawk that Althalus. Althalus has no motivation. We don't know why he's the hero, he has no special qualities, etc.Also, as I stated in the beginning, way to cutesy. They are all a family, all love each other, etc. Sorry, but conflict is at the center of any story, and for the most part there isn't any here between the main characters."
1,Another reason to hate this book,"Ok, Most everything that has been said about this book already has, but I've found one more reason to hate it. Beyond the inane dialog (not only inane, but copied from previous works), the photocopied characters, and the poor description, I'd like to bring up a beef with Edding's ""philosophy"". He makes fun of Christianity at many points throughout the book and touts his own ""philosophy"" that is completely self contradictory. There is this epic battle between good and evil, bad guys and good guys and God says something along the lines of ""it doesn't matter what you believe as long as you believe in something."" I know that some people actually believe this, and I'm OK with that, but in said epic battle it really is just stupid.Anyway, my advice is to stay as far away from this book as possible. You would be wasting your time and money."
1,This is not Catholic marriage prep,This book gives useful hints about planning a wedding and some of the issues that newly married couples will face. To present this book however as Catholic marriage prep is very misleading for the book at times contridicts approved Church teaching. There are other more reliable sources to read if you want to know what Catholic marriage prep is all about.
4,This Coppertone SPF 45 has all the familiar ...,"This Coppertone SPF 45 has all the familiar smells of the Coppertone line and works as expected from a Coppertone product. The lotion applies smoothly, isn't too greasy, and has the added boost of aloe and vitamin E to keep your skin soft. Only two drawbacks: you must apply it 15 minutes prior to going in the sun, and also, you're supposed to reapply it after swimming, although the front of bottle claims that it's waterproof. It would be nice if there were details for how long it's waterproof."
4,"It's easy to start ""walking""","It's a very interesting book, with lots of good exercices. I particularly liked the way how Ed Friedland introduce the reader in the way how to construct your own bass lines. He gives you space for you to do your own bass line, for you to express your own imagination. If you are a starter in this walking bass business, I recomend you to buy this book, you won't be deceived."
2,Useless to the average player/,"This book is useless unless you can read music. Nothing is tabbed. If I could sight-read music, I probably wouldn't need a book to show me how to waly from chore to chord."
1,A deceptive rip off,First of all this book assumes you know how to read music--I have never yet bought a book without tabs. Second every example is in ther key of C. I am so sick of piano books that only teach in the key of C. And especially Guitar and bass as the MAJORITY of us DO NOT read music that is why the TAB system was created. This is lazy and disgusting because the key of C has no sharps and flats. Now I have to tracnscribe all the examples into tab and transpose them.
1,Fake item!!!!!,"I ordered flash point season 2, when it arrived I noticed it was not the item pictured, that first made me very unhappy I am a collector and it doesn't match the other three seasons I own, then after watching it I figure out that it was a mixed episode blend of seasons 2 and 3, and that pissed me off, I would attempt to send item back but why should I, why waste my time and money sending it back and have to wait forever to get replacement item or refund which I may never see, I will never order from this person and I Strongly recommend no one ever orders from this person, they seem to be a scammer,"
5,flashpoint,This is a fantanstic series that is realistic. I bought it for a good price with fast service.
3,CHEAP TOY!,"This product was given to our 9 year old son from Santa. For the price, I thought that all the items I was receiving was going to be a great deal! NOT! The watch battery went dead w/in days after Christmas! The camera, you might as well bought out of a gum-ball machine!...easly broken. (Just by loading the film & the pictures that were developed were horrible. Even the ones I took.) The other ""outdoor items"" are very cheaply made & break easily. (To repeat the quote like they came out of a .50 gum-ball machine.)It is NOT worth it at all. It is very cheaply made! Please save your self the agervation & tears & do NOT buy it!"
3,"Not as good as the first, but still interesting","I'm so glad to know other people like Jane Duncan's series! I thought I was reading them in a vacuum. Anyway, I didn't like 'Muriel' as much as the previous volume, 'The Miss Boyds.' This storyline jumped around in time much more, and the narrator went off on many more tangents that were completely unrelated to the main plot. Although generally her tangents were interesting, it was definitely a different style compared to the first book. As for Muriel herself--well, the narrator warned me I would be unsatisfied with the story's resolution, as she was herself, but I didn't take much comfort in that."
1,Not what was expected,"I bought this book for my daughter who is a fan of the Hannibal Lecter series. I thought it would be a story written from the perspective of someone who was felt Hannibal Lecter had influenced them in such a way that he could have ""fathered"" them. Instead this book is a bunch of profane jibberish. I'm returning it inspite of the cost."
1,"simplistic, boring, ill-informed and misleading","The first half hour or so tells the story of the Trojan War, very slowly and without particularly interesting images. It wrongly suggests that the Trojan Horse and the death of Achilles are in the Iliad. I stopped watching after the claim that Julius Caesar said veni vidi vici on the shores of Britain."
1,I WANT THE ACTUAL VIDEO!!!!!,"I have been waiting a LONG time for this movie to come out. Well, it's out but ONLYas a direct download video. This is NOT what I want!!!I want the ACTUAL video to hold in my hands with studio artwork, etc. Come on, guys!!Get with it!!"
5,Finally on DVD!,"I was so happy to find this movie finally on DVD. My dad loves this movie and I've been looking for it for years, so I didn't hesistate to order. Quality is pretty good too, so it was a win-win all-around for us. Thanks!"
4,Informative,"This book is very informative, it had valuable information of electrical panel locations and how to open up certain parts of the dash board. Could not have done this with out it."
2,Very sad,"I must say this is really a disappointment. Slow tempi, unmatched vibratos, fuzzy, foggy sound much of the time and a 1st fiddle that has REAL trouble in alt. It often sounds like four soloists in search of a common denominator.It's not horrible, but....Sad. Very sad."
5,LOGITECH CAMERA,Logitech Quickcam Communicate STXI was pleased with this camera. It was easy to set up and use. It worked well with Skype and I was able to have video communiction with my son who is stationed in Belgium.
4,Bought 3 & work great!,"If your in need of a web camp, this one works great. I bought one for myself, my parents and grandparents. Our home computers were all a little outdated and didn't have built in webcams. This one is a good bang for your buck. Instructions to set up are easy enough that we were all able to set ours up on our own."
4,Good purchase,It works as it should. I got it to upgrade a very old iMac (OS X 10.3) with a camera for use with Skype. I'd give this product 5 stars except that it doesn't come with Mac-readable software. You need to download a hack from the internet to make it work. I recommend this for use with Macs only if you really know what you have to do.
2,Known issue with microphone,"I purchased this product based on the favorable reviews it has recieved for its pricepoint. Installation was easy, I was generally happy with the camera (my first, so I don't have much to compare it to) but the first time I tried to use it I blasted my son's eardrums by sending loud bursts of static periodically over Skype. Long story short, I researched this on the Logitech board and discovered that there is a long standing potential problem with all models of 5.1/7.1 surround sound audio cards and Logitech webcams models above the 9.x series (they are currently in the 11.x's) The only solution they could offer users experiencing the problem was to disable the webcam microphone and use a different one.This issue has been around for at least two years. You would think Logitech would make their latest generation of webcams compatible with the latest generation of soundcards, but judging from the tech support board, they have made no progress in doing so since 2005."
2,Not that great,I have had this camera for about 6 months. I use it with a new Vista system. Plenty of power and RAM. This camera is not very good for syncing voice and video. I have created several music videos that have the sound running way ahead of the video. I will be getting a different camera. It's no good for YouTube because of the delay.
3,webcam,Have experienced some problems with this webcam trying to synchronize it with Skype! maybe it is me!
1,Webcam doesn't work with USB 1,"Although the description said it was a USB webcam, it turned out that it is USB 2, and when I plugged it into the USB 1 port on my older computer, both the audio and video were unbelievably and unacceptably jerky and broken-up. I returned it."
2,Not a penguin cam,"You shall walk though the valley of darkness should you make the unfortunate claim: ""Great joy! I have found a camera for my Linux host. Let the fun begin!"". Hear me well. I know of UVC cameras, and I say to you -- this is no UVC camera.You will, however, find it adequate for other purposes.Amen."
3,Basic Plus.,"A cliché applies regarding this webcam as, basically, it is what it is. It's no great triumph of technology though. When I talk too fast the picture gets real blurry and my mouth gets out of sync with the words I say; however, I should point out that I only paid 29 bucks for mine. Essentially, I view this product as being about what you'd expect for the price. You're not going to get taken if you buy it but it's a long way from being professional grade. I'm going to get an upgrade soon so I'll post a review on that product which I hope will have 1.3 pixel resolution. Like some of the other folks here, I had problems with the sound so I went out and picked up some headphones which make for a better recording. If I had it to do over again I probably would have pony upped more cash for a better model than this one. You can't fault something this cheap for not being great though."
3,"Works fine most times, but is quirky","The video quality is decent and the microphone works very well. However, sometimes when you unplug it, the camera will uninstall itself. To reinstall it, you need to go through this lengthy process of doing a clean boot and some other tasks, outlined on the website. It is possible that my computer has trouble, but it works fine with other imaging devices (camera) as well other usb devices. The price is ok for what it is. I may try a different one next time due to the irritating connection issue."
2,Difficult at best,"I bought this camera for my Mom, so she and I could talk on skype, and while it IS now working on her Dell, it took some serious troubleshooting. Not good for a non-computer person and me trying to troubleshoot it over the phone. Also this camera will not work on my Mac, so I can see her but she still can't see me! I tried everything I read on the Skype forums and I still can't get it to work on my Mac.If something is sold as plug-and-play... it should be plug-and-play, no? This one is not!"
2,Bad with Skype,"I bought this camera to use with Skype. Unfortunately, it has performed rather poorly thus far. On a two year old computer with all non-essential processes turned off, the video is laggy, but there is no lag in sound. The video quality is fine, but the sound quality horrible. It sounds like a garbled AM radio transmission.I recommend looking elsewhere for a camera to use with Skype."
2,"Close shave, but cheaply made","I had an Atra for at least twenty years with no problems, but lately I couldn't find the blades in any of my three local pharmacies.So I coughed up the money for a Mach3. All the moving parts on my Atra were made out of some type of metal. Not so with the Mach3. Somehow I broke the piece of flimsy plastic which holds the blade in place rendering the razor useless. So I just bought three packs of Atra blades off the internet. p.s. The blade the razor came with was great. I got great shaves. Unfortunately,the remaining other three or so razors were dull."
1,Camera battery,"The battery was not as advertised and did not fit my camera. However, the company was very good and getting a refund was super simple. 5 stars for the company"
1,DVD Poor Quality,"Loved the movie, but disc came scratched and stuck 3/4 of the way through. I had to skip two scenes to get it to play at finish. Poor quality DVD I need a replacement or my money back."
4,Strauss by his compatriots - GREAT,The performance seems excellentVery few have the guts to play Richard Strauss (e.g. Burleska for piano or the AlpenSinfonie) but Kempe is convincing
2,Help comes too easily to the main character,"I borrowed this book via Prime. What really bothered me is that all the help Diana got just seemed too easy.** Slight spoilers **In every situation, men were falling all over each other to help her. Jim decides to take her under his wing after seeing her ride once & barely speaking to her. Steve decides to give her Navarro & helps her train him. Bill falls in love with her after seeing her once. The crazy french guy fakes a heart attack so she'll come back to his boat with her.It goes on & on.Even up to the end when she get set up financially (how convienent).Aside from being gorgeous (which was described over & over) I didn't see what was so special about her. It made it hard for me to connect with her as a character.I would've rather seen Diana do more things on her own to create her success - like trying modeling for a while to make money, so she could pursue her real dream - instead of crying that she wanted her equestrian success immediately."
1,Very overpriced,Gillette must have a monopoly to get away with these ridiculous prices. It is time they get some real competition. Product works okay but rating poor for being overpriced.
1,Cheap Knocoffs or seconds product,"The razor blades do not seem to be original Mach3 blades but cheap knockoffs or may be faulty ones.The first blade I used did not give a clean shave in one stroke. I thought may be this is an exception, so I took the second one (from the same pack)but got the same below par results. Still not convinced that this is a faulty product I used a third blade with same poor shave.I have been using Mach3 razor for 10 years and am fairly confident that this is a low quality product."
1,Not worth the cost,The cost of these blades is not worth the quality of the shave you will get from them. It's the law of diminishing returns. Having one blade is much better than no blade at all. Dual blade shavers are a little better than a one blade razor. Adding any more blades after that just is not worth it. It just doesn't make sense how expensive these refills are. I recommend you do not buy these expensive razors but instead opt for cheaper disposable dual-head razors. I thought the disposable razors might do a worse job than blades like these or ones with four blades but they are just as good as those blades.
1,Be careful out there: These are counterfeit blades,"This review is only for the Gillette MACH3 Cartridges, 10-Count Blister Sustainable Pack. It is embarrassing that A. has a marketplace seller offering these counterfeits. As soon as I saw the packaging, I had a sinking feeling (having read older reviews of other packagings of the MACH3); when I testing one, then a real blade that I still had, I noticed immediately how much smoother was the genuine MACH3 shave (and I have been using these for many years). I returned these and bought others at Target."
1,Beware..Fake Blades,I purchased this item about a month ago. These blades are counterfeit.They are counterfiet because1) The packaging was not the same as original blades.2) The blade did not snap on my handle securely and falls out when shaving.3) Blades are already worn out and were full of dust when package opened.4) The blades dont have a lubricant strip as the genuine blades have. They have a rubber strip to imitate the lubricant strip.5) Blades are misaligned causing cuts on my face.
3,"Good razor, way too expensive","These razors are definitely solid. I've been using Mach 3 razors for a long time and always get a close shave, quickly and with cuts being very rare and usually the result of my own negligence. That being said these razors are just too expensive! They are even more in the grocery store, but even online they are more than 2 dollars when you buy a dozen! Shortly after I bought this box of razors I discovered Dorco which has a mach 3 like system with razors that costs less than a dollar each and are very sharp. I switched to Dorco after I finished out this box of razors."
5,delivered as promised,delivered as promised delivery was good I am happy I don't know what else to say about such a review. It was perfect. after all they were new razor blades
4,The real thing,These are just like the store bought ones. I did not receive knockoffs. At the price they are a great deal for those who use this razor.
5,Favorite Razors,The Gillette Mach 3 razor is the best razor for the price and kicks the shick out of Shick. Will buy again.
1,FAKE,"In the past I have purchased these blades as long as the seller was ""Amazon.com"". I've been burned by getting fakes blades when I used sellers that were not Amazon.com.This time, I bought two 12 packs from the seller ""Amazon.com"" and just opened them up this morning to use and discovered they were clearly fake! It is past the date range return the blades so I am stuck with them. I thought buying from the seller ""Amazon.com"" would have been safe but I was wrong. Buyer beware, I recommend going to a store to buy your blades."
1,Not originals,"I feel cheated...and scammed. Shame on you Amazon. There is no way that these are legit Gillette MACH3 cartridges as they go dull after a single shave. As anyone who uses a MACH3 knows, their real blades last a really long time...even for poor shmucks like me with thick beards. At first I thought maybe I was mistaken, but by the time my second blade didn't get me through my second shave, I knew something was wrong."
1,Knock-offs,"Having shaved with Gillette Mach 3 blades for some time now, I believe these are a knock-off. They don't have the feel of new blades and certainly not up to Gillette's standards."
1,Education is the key,"I am not badmouthing this writer in the least, but he should be more eduacted if he were to write a children's book. No one imagines that what you tell a child when they are young, sticks with them. If they imagine wolves to be scary, fiersome creatures, they will always fear them. You must all understand that wolves are gentle, loving creatures and would have a less chance of hurting you than your own household dog would."
5,"Wonderful result of a night of insomnia,","Had insomnia and decided to go to the Amazon and see what caught my eye. I had to look at this one it reminded me of a Gemini necklace I had before in high school.You can guess, ordering jewelry online is tricky but after all ""Nothing ventured, nothing gained"".Took no longer than I had hoped and was very happy with the condition on arrival very nice puffy jewel box case and a mount. Now I am reminded again of the piece that I mnentioned this is just the same almost albeit a little smaller. It is very elegant, delicate and hollow and has a very sparkly sheen to it I love it, it is even more beautiful than the product shown on the page and makes a good fashion statement without being too flamboyant.All in all, I recommend highly"
2,Joan of Arc,"Unfortunately, this version has subtitles that you cannot eliminate. You MUST see the subtitles in either English, or two versions of Chinese.All subtitles appearing on the screen are very distracting while trying to watch the movie."
4,a documentary show.,"I don't know what others are reviewing here, but I am reviewing the documentary 'warrior women' joan de arc""it is narrated by Lucy Lawless and is well done. It's forty five minutes long and this company prints their products on dvdr's for some reason. That is a minus but the show is a good one about saint joan. And what a incredible , tragic and herioc and even awful life she lived. This made me realize how brave and incredibly strong willed she was. She really believed in herself and her times were so nightmarish that it's inspiring how she even attemped to do what she did. She was only a kid and yet few would ever claim to be as brave as she was. Her rape and hideous death by being burned alive are only part of the story. The king she served was not a good man by any means of the word imo, Still the photography is good here and they do some recreations. So this is NO movie , it's good though."
4,Easily Programmed,Found this to be easily programmed for the automatic settings. Also liked the 1-4 cup setting when making a smaller amount ensuring the quality of taste.
5,Cuisinart Coffeemaker,I love this bright red coffeemaker! The quality is far above that of other coffeemaker brands I have purchased in the past. I would not hesitate to purchase another Cuisinart product based on my satisfaction with this machine.
5,The coffee is fantastic!,"Buying this coffeemaker was a big step up for us--we had always bought inexpensive machines before, assuming there wasn't much difference. The coffee that this Cuisinart makes is the best coffee we've ever had in the house. We think it's because it has a water filter, and the temperature of the water (and the coffee itself) is much hotter. But the flavor and strength of the coffee is totally superior to everything else. We are using the same coffee that we used in the other machines; therefore, we are confident that the coffeemaker is making the difference. Definitely a worthwhile purchase!"
5,Great Coffeemaker,"This coffeemaker is far better than I expected. First of all, without reading instructions I was able to easily understand all functions. Programming was a breeze. Secondly, it actually makes HOT coffee which seems to be an impossible task for most cofeemakers today. Thirdly and most important, it makes a great cup of coffee. It has no need for a brew strength button as that is adjusted with the number of scoops of coffee you add. It also has a very neat feature that allows you to press a button labeled 1-4 if you are making a short pot so the brew strength is correct for just a few cups being brewed. This is just an all around excellent product and the price is appropriately reasonable."
5,Great coffeemaker for common coffee drinkers,"My red Cuisinart adds a nice color splash to my countertop. The maker is easy to use and program. I appreciate the auto-off and set mine for four hours. The controls are easy to push and see. I really like the five beeps that tell me the coffee is ready and the two beeps that tell me when it is automatically shutting off. The coffee is very hot and tastes just right. While saying this, keep in mind that I do not subscribe to the gourmet coffees and expensive coffee shops that are currently popular. I enjoy a nice supermarket brand of coffee, occasionally brewing some flavored packets such as Berres Brothers, Door County Coffee, or Harry and David."
5,Good cup of coffee,"I've only had this coffeemaker a few days so I can't speak for its longevity. But it brews a delicious cup of coffee, and really fast, too. First good cup of coffee I've made at home in a really long time."
5,Cuisinart Coffeemaker Red,"My red coffee maker is perfect, the right red, the size fits underneath my kitchen cabinets. Like that I can program it the next morning and has auto shut off. Makes a great cup of coffee. Would recommend this product to any one wanting a excellant coffee maker."
2,Big disappointment,"This machine has several good features about it; however, I wouldn't recommend it for several reason. I have never had glass stain. The carafe has permanent brown staining on the bottom. I've tried hand washing, putting it in the dish washer and even bleaching. I've even used a mild scrubber without results. When I contacted Cuisinart, I was told to put a few drop of dish detergent and hot water in it and let it soak. What a joke! Also, there is a scummy film on the last cup of coffee which coats the mug. I have never had this happen before and I have had several coffee makers over the years. Cuisinart didn't even address this problem. The bottom of the machine is rusting and I have to keep a paper towel under to prevent it from staining the counter top. I had it since April but am seriously considering replacing it."
3,Shipping,"I was charged $30.00 (29.95) for overnight shipping, the cost of the product was $59.00. Product did not arrive overnight~still do not have product."
3,You'd better be near a stove!,"I bought this coffee maker to replace a 20 year old Krupps. The only reason I replaced the old one was because I the time display on the old one finally gave out and I couldn't set the time on it at all. I can't give this one any more than three stars because the coffee comes out lukewarm. Even if you set the ""1-4 cup"" setting, which is supposed to double heat the coffee, it's still just warm. So every morning I pour my coffee, add the cream (raw, heavy cream... fabulous) and then pour it into a saucepan so I can get it to coffee-temperature. If I don't reheat it, it's at the temperature it should be if I'd left it sitting on the counter for 10 minutes already. If I could do it over again, I'd get a different coffee maker. But since I already bought this, and I work from home so I'm always near my stove, I'll hang on to it. However, it's a disappointment."
3,"Good coffee, but making it is a pain","This coffee maker has several good features, including auto on-off and pause, and it does make good coffee. But it is almost impossible to pour water from the glass carafe into the reservoir without spilling some of it. The mouth of the reservoir is narrow, and the top lid design interferes with the carafe, so that at least some of the water winds up on the kitchen counter instead of in the reservoir. I am now using a small measuring cup instead of the carafe to pour the water."
2,Stopped working after 3 months,The coffee maker worked fine for 4 months than quit working. I called Cuissinart direct to see if there was someone that would avise me what might need to be done to fix the machine. I was advised to return the item and they will repair/replace. I am required to pay to ship the product back to them with the receipt and $10.00. For the price I paid for this coffee pot I expected more!I WOULD NOT recommend this coffer maker! I love shopping with Amazon but purchasing electronics or household items I will buy direct from a local store that will stand behind the products they sell next time!
2,Only lasted 6 months,"We bought this in a hurry since our old coffee pot died at the worst possible time - the first day home with a new baby!After 6 months of use, I would have given the pot a 4-star ranking. But today the pot completely died. I can't believe it only lasted 6 months. I would still buy a Cuisinart, but definitely NOT this model."
2,leaks coffee all over the counter,"My wife bought me this to replace the last cuisinart I had, one that made warm coffee and leaked all over the counter. This model makes hotter coffee, which is nice. But after about two weeks of use I see that this coffee maker too is leaking coffee on my countertop. That is UNACCEPTABLE.After owning two of their coffee makers, and both having the same problem, I see that cuisinart doesn't care about their product. Many many reviews have pointed out that their coffee makers leak. Yet nothing has been done. A bit of QA testing would have caught this design flaw. Obviously, that hasn't taken place.I'm going to return it for a different coffee maker, but I'll never have another Cuisinart coffee maker."
2,Not a Cuisinart,"Unfortunately, this product does not live up to its brand name. Although it makes perfectly good coffee and functions as advertised, it falls short on what I would expect a well designed product to deliver. To fill the carafe you must remove the lid completely. This takes two hands. The reservoir cover does not open back far enough for you to poor all of the water out of the carafe. And upon pouring coffee into your cup be prepared to wipe some off the counter unless you prefer to drip on the floor. Obviously, not manufactured by Cuisinart but a third-rate product with a first-rate name. Sorry ... I was disappointed."
4,Great coffee maker!,"When my Bunn burned out I was weary about buying a coffee maker that did not have the heated water reservoir since I like my coffee hot. This Cuisinart got rid of all of my weariness. This thing heats up coffee very well and brews a great cup of coffee. It even has a 1-4 cup special setting which will make your coffee even hotter since you are making a small amount. To be honest, the regular setting is hot enough. This coffeemaker is wonderful! I also love the program feature. Waking up with your coffee already brewed and the kitchen filled with my favorite coffee smell makes my day! The only negative I can say about this product is that it is awkward when filling the water reservoir since the opening is a little small and the angle of the carafe spout is not compatible with that.....but the many pros outweigh this con."
2,Good until it stopped working after 1.5 years,"Good (but not great) cup of coffee, decent brewing speed, small water resevoir to pour water into machine was annoying but manageable, but the machine stopped pumping water and the heating element failed after just 1.5 years of use! The machine's warranty is for 3 years, but you have to pay shipping to and from the Cuisinart service center BOTH WAYS (this should run you around $25-30 dollars, half the price of the machine!). And they don't have service centers across the country you can drive to, you have to ship your broken coffee maker it to them. I'm sorry, but a coffeemaker that breaks after 1.5 years of service? Not so great."
2,Only 6 months old,"Bought this from Lowe's to go w/the rest of my black appliances and utensils. After 6 months I can no longer set the clock or brew start time. That was my favorite feature next to the interrupt function. Disappointed as the coffee pot was not cheap when I bought it and have had other inexpensive ones last years. I do like the lid, it's almost impossible to spill coffee when pouring which I always tended to do w/other coffee pots."
5,Cuisinart DCC-1100,"Basically we bought a Cuisinart coffeemaker because of the excellent reviews in Consumer Reports magizine. It is quick, makes excellent coffee, keeps the coffee hot, and looks good on the counter. what more can you ask?"
3,Bad coffee pot.,I had read before hand that the pot leaks when you pour. Mine did when I first used it. I figured that I could calk around the plastic spout; have not gotten around to it yet. I have had the pot for 1 year and know to pour the coffee over the sink. I have not investagated what calk would be safe to make the repair. It seemed too much of a hassel to go through Cuisnart as I read that the problem was such that swaping for a new pot did not guarantee a pot that would not leak. I do not understand why Cuisnart failed to test the posts after so many bad reviews! I rated it a three star because it is a good brewer.
3,Disappointed,"I bought this coffee maker strictly based on the positive reviews found on Amazon, as it was one of the least expensive and well-reviewed coffee makers. I find it very difficult to pour the water back into the coffee maker. The carafe and the back of the coffee maker were just not made for each other. I usually spill water into the coffee grounds and I'm pouring as slowly as I can. It's a bad design.Further, if you are a parent who just wants to make a cup of coffee before your kids get up, beware. This thing beeps loudly once the coffee is ready and again when the coffee maker shuts itself off. There is NO WAY to turn this off. I really do not need a coffee maker that is going to wake up my kids!"
5,One great coffee maker,"Despite some bad reviews, I can tell you that this coffee maker is well worth the money. The complaints about the product might be from people who have never used a coffee maker before, because in my experience this machine couldn't be simpler to operate. Also, the instruction booklet has detailed accounts of everything from how to set the clock, to programming delayed brew, to making the perfect cup of coffee. A great Amazon price, too! $30 less than department stores, not to mention delicious coffee."
3,Disappointed,"OK, I knew that the hole for the water was small, so I won't complain about that. However, I have had this coffee makes app 5 mos., and for the last 2 mos., the base where the coffee pot sits has the black finish coming off. I have never used anything other than a dry towel to clean, yet the finish is coming off. Additionally, I followed the directions to clean when the light came on, and after 4 cycles of water/vinegar mix, the clean light still won't shut off. No way it's that dirty."
4,Cuisinart DCC-1100BK 12-Cup Programmable Coffeemaker,"works great, coffee tastes like real coffee, only gripe is a minor one - LED should change color when brew cycle is complete"
1,Already broken after just 2 months,"I ordered the coffeemaker and received it around the end of july. It worked fine until end of Sept and it broke. I contacted the company, Cuisinart, and after 2 weeks of e-mail, the company said I would have to pay $10.00 for shipping a new coffeemaker. They also want me to return the maker by mail at my expense. I am really disappointed. I would not purchase from this company in the future, I will not purchase from a company that is not willing to back it's product. All the cost for shipping is almost the amount I paid for the coffeemaker. I do not recommend anyone buying from this company."
4,Very good cup of coffee,Consistently makes a very good cup of coffee. Footprint on the counter is not much and it's a nice looking machine. I'd give this 4.5 stars as the only fault I can identify after 2 months of use is that the control buttons appear a bit suspect.
3,Rusting warmer plate.,"I bought the coffee maker in January 2009 to replace a Krups, which I had for many years. The Cuisinart had a great review so I took a chance. The coffee maker worked fine, but the warming plate started to rust. I called Cuisinart, as the coffee maker was still under a 3 year warranty. They told me that the rusting warmer plate was cosmetic so they would not repair it. I still had my receipt so I returned the coffee maker (a year old, without the box) to Bed Bath & Beyond. They took it back, no questions asked. With the credit, I bought a different( higher end model) Cuisinart and will be more carefull when cleaning the the warming plate. It the warming plate rusts again, I will go back to Krups."
1,Fire Hazard,"I bought this coffee maker not quite 3 years ago and used it almost daily. Yesterday I left the machine on after pouring my first cup of coffee. When I returned to the kitchen half an hour later, smoke came from the heating platform and the back of the machine. I watched it for about a minute, unsure if it was just hot water evaporating. The smoking intensified, I unplugged the machine and took it to the patio.Today I called Cuisinart customer service and talked to a supervisor. The company claims they DON'T KNOW about a possible fire hazard and don't have any issues with this model. I recommended going on amazon.com to read up on what people have to say. She was not amused. She offered an exchange with the same model. I am disappointed that they don't seem to care about the potential danger and just keep on selling the same product. I declined a replacement and will buy a another brand. Too bad, I really liked the machine the day before yesterday."
4,RLG,"I just put these tires on my Schwin Aluminum mountain bike. I am not a bike guy, i bought this bike a couple years ago so i could cruise around the neighborhood with my 5 yr old son. The knobby tires on the bike made it very unenjoyable. Dont ask me why i bought a mountain bike, it has never gone off pavement, and has not even been close to a mountain..I told you i am not a bike guy. These Cheng tires make this bike great. These are great tires for those of you looking to use your mountain bike on the street. Was not sure what size tire to buy, the tires on the bike were almost 2"" wide, and the rims are very skinny.. less than 3/4"". These tires fit great, and ride very smooth. For the price, there is not a better buy out there...I checked."
3,filtered,"The book gave a one-sided view which blamed the IMF's structural adjustment programs for the exponential growth of slums around some of the richest cities in the world, while completely ignoring the responsibility of local leadership and corruption in national governments."
5,Great Cookbook,"Cookbook was a gift for my son and daughter-in-law. They loved it and will use it many times, I'm sure."
3,You get what you pay for,I would have given it a higher rating if I didn't have to wait for almost a month to receive it.The product is as advertised and really protects the controller.
1,Not exactly what you get,"I literally just got these in the mail 5 mins ago. I'll keep it short, sweet & to the point. These so-called ""skins"" aren't even the 1s in the (bleep)'n picture. I got 2 black, 1 red & 1 blue. The red is a lighter color & so is the blue 1. The 2 black 1s aren't the same and seem as if rushed when put together. An added bonus (sarcasm) is that it isn't even the same design! The only good thing about it (the case/skin) is that it does feel better to hold than the smooth exterior finish of the PS3 controller. All in all I guess this is a case of you regrettably get what you pay cheaply for."
1,Junk,"Ugh i have to put together 20 words for these things.....well they suck. They fit the controllers like hell. I mean they really look crapy, they didn't add to the look of the controler at all. It was easy to see defects in there molding process. I would not buy honestly you'd be better off buying th controler in the color you want. I gave all four of mine away to buddies...and they just tossed them in the trash so i guess your call lol."
4,The pictures aren't what they actually are. ;(,I needed some sleeves for my controllers because my hands start sweating after a while of playing so I bought this undecided but they are over all comfortable in your hands eventhough the grip is actually in the front and not in the sides/back.
5,Ultra value and superior quality.,"I was beyond skeptical of the quality of these because of their low price, but because they were so cheap I decided that it wouldn't be a big deal if they were crap.However, these are perfect. They fit my hand fantastically- making the controller slightly bigger (I'm a 20 year old). I don't know if I would recommend these for younger children, but they are easy to remove.The texture keeps these from slipping, and they never hold sweat!It's great trading controllers with a friend and not receiving a warm, sweaty controller.This is a must buy!"
3,Silicone skin Cases,well i bought these and still have them just everybody else said there great but there not the ones on the pic the ones u get are a light color
1,I agree with everyone...LOUSY game,"I too am an avid Sudoku fan and was quite upset to learn I am not even able to return this item to the store I bought it at...I even called UFO. They only do the manuals and have nothing to do with programming. The guy thinks that the company that designed it is in the UK, I guess the British do not play Sudoku. But I concur with everyone's thoughts...there is no way that you can solve these puzzles without having the ability to ""pencil"" in all numeric possibilities and yes I found that the font made it difficult to distinguish between certain numbers. I am glad I did get it on sale for 10 bucks..but no wonder why it was reduced in price at the store from 19.99."
1,Way too hard,"I like the Sudoku on my Brain Age games. It doesn't let you put multiple numbers in a square so you can narrow down the ""right"" choice. And it doesn't give you a hint if it was the wrong choice. This must be a game for experts."
1,Total waste of money,This has to be one of the worst games I have purchased. I bought it for my wife and she played it for about 30 minutes and gave up on it. The graphics are terrible and its nothing like a traditional Sudoku.
1,How can I get my money back?,"This is an awful game! I bought it because I've finished all the Sudoku puzzles that came with Brain Age. I'll have to go play them again, because I just wasted $9.99 on this junk.The worst part is that there's no way to enter possible solutions. You can have either a blank square or a number, that's it.I also only played for a short while and was too frustrated to continue, but the puzzles on the difficult level do not appear solvable - and I'm a pretty good player.I have a version for my PDA that lets you choose colors instead of numbers and I love that feature, so I thought I'd like the different themes on this game, but they're just really annoying.I also think the touch screen programming is off. When you click on an item, sometimes it works and sometimes it acts as though you touched something else. I haven't noticed this on my other DS games, so I assume it's shoddy programming.This game is TERRIBLE!"
2,cd----Laura & other music titles,"NOT AMAZONS FAULT,sUPPLIER OUT OF STOCK & FAILED TO NOTIFY AMAZON OF THAT SITUATION.PLEASE LET ME KNOW WHEN IT IS AVAILABLE THRU YOU. THANKS VERY MUCH."
5,The Best Way to Learn Geography,"My family had an older version of this globe when I was a child. It is the reason that all three kids made A's in geography and can locate almost any contry on a map! My two favorite parts were the songs from the countries and the ""Eureka"" game. We finally wore out the pen. This is the best way to learn geography. Your kids will WANT to play/learn with this for years."
1,Fell apart BEFORE I got to the pool!,"All I can say is that I'm still in shock. These LITTERALLY fell apart before I got in the pool. I tried to remedy the situation by tying the ends so that I could use them and they fell off my face in the pool. I purchased them because they are labeled ""anti fog"" but I didn't get a chance to find out if they were or not because they were ""anti worth it!"" Truthfully, they do not deserve the one star. Hope someone else has better luck with these than I did."
2,Rouge's Curse,"I, too was confused by the way this book jumps out of continuity with the others. It takes place after the Battle for the Palace Shards. And that is a stroy not told for a least a few more books after Rogue's Curse. I don't know why they decided to do that, it doesn't make any sense. However, it is a very compelling story, and it shed a new light on the often misunderstood character of Rayek. I did miss the other elves while reading it, though. I look forward to getting back to their story in future volumes. I recomend getting it, but not until it's chronlogicaly nesescary by story, not by number. Don't make the mistake I did by reading it too soon, it will give future plotlines away!"
4,not very bad,sorry for my poor english but i am a student in kyoto university in japan and i really enjoyed this book. i have read many reviews on this website and it make me understand that many people will focus on marketing side of the analysis inside this book. but this is not true. the book has many good idea about overall business management. some people will say that these idea are not new. so what? good idea is good idea and i surely enjoy reading the wonderful thought in this book. i would recommendation you read it for youself. i hope my reader review is useful to you. thank you.
2,Works at first but then dies at restart,I was very excited to try this product on my powerbook G4.. it worked the very first time.. but after a restart.. it no longer worked. was quite disappointed as i tried to reset it and try setting ut up again. it was fruitless. So I dont recommend this product as I'm truly upset with its performance.
5,Excellent set,"What a wonderful set! I am a fan of Tchaikovsky, particularly of the Nutcracker. This set contains all of the music, not just highlights, from these three ballets. But just as importantly, the sound quality is wonderful -- the music is very well performed. I've seen all three of these ballets performed at Lincoln Center, and am impressed by these CDs. The liner notes are quite informative as well."
2,Received used book not the new one I paid for online,Needed book for Bible Class and saw there were x amount of new books at a reasonable price and purchased the new one and received a used one instead
4,Still our Favorite Princess...,"I agree with Famous Jano. Did the other reviewers read the book??? Sure...the book is fluff and not an academia read. What did we Diana watchers expect?? However, it shows Diana as an English Rose ~with~ her thorns. A more well-rounded interpretation.I think to get a full objective look at the ""real"" Diana one needs to read all the books from her inner circle (Simone Simmons, Paul Burrell, Patrick Jephson, Andrew Norton, etc.) and then one can get a clearer picture of Diana.My opinion is that Diana is part of history now and it is a good idea that Diana biographers are getting their words down in print. Sadly, in a 100 years our ""People's Princess"" might be a blip on the radar screen and most of the historical information about her may come from the inner circle, since the Royal Family, as of right now, does not look in a hurry to write a tell-all book about ""their"" Diana.What I get from Simone Simmons' Diana is someone I sure would have liked to have had lunch with!!"
5,Awesome!,"This is my all-time favorite microplane. It stays razor sharp, and it delivers thin, long, wonderful layers of cheese. There is little better than eating a steaming plate of spaghetti topped with melting *ribbons* of cheese (vs little powdery dustings.) Highly recommend."
4,Gillette....the best a man can get...well....just about !,"The Mach 3 in 2001 became my new razor after the regular Sensor. However, even a great shave comes at a great price..... the expense was too much-wow. I wondered just how different the Mach 3 was to its prior bud, the Excel. No difference. Really.It did just as good of a job. And at a cheaper price, I have decided to stay with the Sensor.Caution: If you have sensitive skin, please use something unscented or non-foamy (shaving cream). My face dried out using this with the 'cheap' foam Gilette stuff. Use a gel."
2,Unbelieveable,"Could have been a good book but situations created by the author are ill conceived, some of the characters are badly drawn. A woman bright enough to win scholarships, a high profile position and much largess surely is too savy to play the patsy.Do I detect a rather large amount of female chauvinism on the part of the author?"
3,It was okay until....,"First, it seems as if Ms. Goldsmith would have us believe that nearly every woman in prison is the victim of the system or some man. Some of the characters were cliched, like the prison guard who assaults the women when no one is around, the kindly warden, etc. But the book was a quick and entertaining read, until I got to the end. That's when Ms. Goldsmith recommends other books about the topic, including Live From Death Row by Mumia Abu Jamal. All of a sudden it seemed like a flimsy novel was trying to make some political statement.It bothered me that best-selling authors are recommending the ""writings"" of a convicted cop killer. Yes, I know he has every right to write a book and she has every right to recommend it, but I have the right not to like it."
3,Chicklit Behind Bars,"This is in many ways a very typical Olivia Goldsmith novel--Man does woman wrong. Woman gets revenge, and in the process learns to depend on herself and her girlfriends. What doesn't work for me in this book, is the attempt to intermingle this bit of fluff with the difficult subjects of crime and the Correctional System. It winds up being kind of ""Gidget goes to Prison"", a bit too unrealistic to take seriously and a bit heavy for fluff."
3,good but,its overly sticky for most uses . if i planned on using this on a rifle id go with the self sticking one without adhesive on it
1,VERY DISSAPPOINTED.....FRUSTRATED,I was extremely dissappointed in these dishes and that Amazon would ship such poor quality items. I ordered one place setting. On each of the 3 plates (Dinner/Salad/Bread) the circular pattern was so askew it looked like a grade school child had aligned it. Not only was the pattern very askew but the plates did not sit evenly and looked bent out of shape around the edges.Even more frustrating was my experience with the telephone assistance I received from Amazon. A woman with an Indian accent who could not understand what I was telling her was wrong with the plates. She insisted it perhaps was just askew on the images presented in the preview on Amazon's site. Very time consumating and irritating. This lady was very hard to understand. I will think twice before ordering anything like this from Amazon again.
2,Kindle Replacement USB Cable,"I appreciate the free replacement and shipping. The service rep was courteous and efficient and delivery was prompt. However, the product seems to be exactly the same as the original -- the one that came to pieces in my drawer. I am treating this one a little differently: I have hung it up on a wall from two hangers so that it doesn't bend too sharply at any point. It remains to be seen if this one will last longer than the original."
1,this cord does not fit a kindle,This cord does not fit my kinle as I want a cable for an exact fit. I went to amazon purchased this cable only to find it bto large.Now wHat?
2,hope the replacement holds up better than the original,"My USB cable for my kindle has literally self-destructed. It is falling apart in little tiny pieces-leaving the cable that it insulates and protects exposed. I am receiving a credit to my accout to order a replacement courtesy of Amazon. I spoke with the representative when I called to complain. He was ""unaware"" of any problems with this cable.....After reading the opinions shared here, I KNOW that there is a problem and hopefully it has been addressed. Ordering a new cable apparently takes 5-7 weeks? How lovely....I use my Kindle daily, how do I charge it in the meantime. Guess I will have to be creative !"
1,Not the right stuff,"This product was recommended by Amazon, after I reached customer service to advise the the connector wire between the Kindle device and the power supply did not stay connected. It often disconnected itself. I was advised to purchase a new one (and the cost was to be credited.). The new one does not fit my Kindle device. I have not yet returned it, having been out of town, but plan to do so. doris bloch"
3,"OK, but check the errata first","Like software that is rushed out the door full of bugs, this book seems to have been rushed to the printer and is REPLETE with errors. Granted, for $15 this book is still a bargain, but get the errata and go through it and correct all the errors first. In fact, it's got so many errors that I've pretty much set it aside until the second edition.Again, too many errors for the rather complicated examples he presents. Tread carefully..."
3,"Concise book, but muddy explanations","Dear Amazon-browsing knowledge seeker:THe conciseness of this book was nice in the first few chapters,but one wants clear explanations for topics like pointers and variable references.I found these crucial topics to be very hastily and muddily described: not at all what one wants in an introductory book.One definitely gets the feeling that the author was in too much of a hurry writing this book!I hope this review helps you with your quest.your humble reviewer."
3,A Reasonable Regency,"I had high expectations of this novel because of the reviews of other commentators, but I did not feel that it lived up to them. The heroine was a bit too submissive for my tastes, the hero was an ordinarily pleasant young man with little to distinguish him as an object of affection, and the character of the Aunt was simply nasty. I did not find anything charming or amusing about her irritability at all. She is uniformly rude and selfish, and I could find few sympathetic traits. I was astonished when she received an offer of marriage in the conclusion. That made little sense to me, especially since this comes from the most likeable character in the book. But overall it's still a pleasant enough way to wile away an afternoon."
5,Tea Set,"Bought this tea set for my 3.5 year old daughter and it is perfect. The teapot does not leak like some I have seen. The cups turn purple/dark pink when cold so it looks like a real drink (other than water). The cups are also larger than ones I have seen so they hold a great deal of liquid. It is plastic and nicely made. I would recommend to any parent with a young child. I also bought a procelain tea set for her and I to play with, but this tea set is for her tea parties with other little kids and stuffed animals."
3,dvd 's are fine though some thing is missing,"the movie dvd's are excellent with special features.but their are no additional things,like postcards,lobbycards,a booklet of sorts.compare this with marquee collectn or moon over miami dvd,their postcard pis are kept in nice envelopes."
3,absence of design ....,"I will be the last person to rate unfavorably a book that is highly praised by the likes of Noam Chomsky and Gore Vidal.However, in my calculation I give it a 6 stars for contents and I deduct 3 stars for being the absolute worst designed book that I have ever had in my hands.The spacing from the side of the page to the print and that from the print to the spine is so minuscule as to make reading difficult, because the page will necessarily be arched and the eye will have a problem going quickly back to the proper next line to read on.That is before even considering that the practical absence of any negative space imparts to the book a sense of aesthetic affront and meagerness, rendered more severe by the unfortunate usage of forced justification (the print stretching precisely from the right to the left side of the columns, altering the natural kerning and spacing).I have never seen such a badly designed book.What a pity for a book of such incredible contents value!"
4,Got my balls,"My purchase arrived when it was supposed to and in excellent condition. I know it would have been easier to just go to the store and buy these but I had some money left on a gift card, and I knew I would not be disappointed with my purchase."
5,Startech Removable SATA Drive Drawer,"I have used removable drive drawers for several years - beginning back with SCSI drives years ago. Am now migrating from SCSI to SATA - large drives much more reasonably priced - and this SATA drive drawer is the best that I can find. Well made and easy to work with, I use it on 2 machines and will use it on all machines that I put together from now on."
2,"The Little Rascals,Our Gang Vintage Collection","I ordered this dvd,but sent it back,because I didn't like the quality of the movie,especially because of the price,didn't think it was worth the money."
4,really really helpful,This book is really relevant to today! for any type of runner and any age! has programmes and helpful hints for runners from all walks of life! will helpo you get to the top! has really helped me with this crosscountry season! I believe there are also swimming ones as well!
3,Mixed Review,"I ordered this kit during our study of ancient civilizations. What better place to begin than Egypt. I thought my boys (ages 6 & 7) would enjoy the games and making their own heiroglyphics. The package was very interesting looking and peaked their curiosity immediately. However, the beads to the necklace were next to impossible to string. The stamps were also very small and did not stay in the place when trying to make the heiroglyphic messages. The book and sample papyrus were great. In fact, my 6 year old took both to our homeschool co-op for show and tell. All in all, not bad, but a little pricey for what you get."
4,Ancient Egypt Set,i got this for my little 10 year old sister for Christmas and she adored it! lately she's been into archaeology and egypt and i knew this would be the perfect gift for her! some pieces were missing and its Very hard (atleast for me and/or until you get it open once and then get the key out) to open but other than that she still places with it a month later.
3,Just not the same as the older version!,"I read the original version of this wonderful book years ago, and had thought it was long out of print, so I was thrilled to see this paperback version available, albeit with a new title. But as another reviewer has noted...beware if you are replacing an old copy of the book with this version! The photographs are very, very disappointing. They look as if they were copied on an old mimeograph machine. Because the photos were black and white to begin with, they are now very blurry and hard to recognize. I can't imagine why a company would go to the trouble to reproduce such an exhaustive look at the era of movie musicals...and then wimp out on the photos, many of which are previously unpublished from Arthur Freed's personal collection! The text is still great, but I am really disappointed in the quality of this reprint. Part of the appeal of this book has always been the photos."
2,GENERIC don't last long enough,"These generic batteries fit well in the camera (Digital Rebel), and work well. But, they don't last even 10% compared to the brand-name battery. They are good for an emergency, when your brand-name battery goes off.Be careful when you purchase these generic kind of batteries with different names. They are all the same, with different names, brands, and prices. Bought 2 of them with different ""characteristics"" and names, received the same item twice, and was charged twice for a single delivery. Buy the cheapest, is the same as the others."
1,Does not last - not worth it!,"I purchased this battery to save some money. I didn't want to fork out the huge price for the Canon BP511. However, this battery is a complete waste of money. It took maybe 50 photos before I would have to recharge it. Now, it won't even hold a charge. If I want to use it, I have to charge it and use it right away to get my 30 photos.I am hoping that there are other non-name brand batteries out there that are equivalent to Canon, but this one is definitely not it."
3,I thought this was a stocking..,"The bars are delicious, and very cool for the Cadbury chocolate lover. I just thought it was a real stocking, and not cardboard."
1,Not practical,"There are probably over a hundred one and three step techniques shown in this book. Of those, only about five are actually usefull (and those are extremley basic). Most of the techniques would require inhuman ability to perform in a real-life situation. For example, in most of the illustrations, Master Cho is well into his technique before his attacker has even moved. Also, his attacker stops about two feet short of hitting Master Cho, so that Cho has plenty of time and space to move around in."
4,Good lens,"Nice lens, very sharp, contrasty. Very close shots in very bright sun sometimes show purple fringing but otherwise a very nice lens, I'm happy with it."
1,Surprisingly bad,"I've really liked all the Louise Hay products I bought until this one. I wasted my money. Instead of a clear and useful talk, it contains a lot of sappy music and sound effects. When she is speaking, it's not a learning experience for the listener."
3,Fact or fiction?,"While this book was extremely helpful in my research on Anna Leonowens I believe the reader does not get a true picture of her life because there are many gaps in the story. She fails to go into depth on the matter of her popularity with slaves when she often paid for their freedom. I recommend this book for people trying to get a sense of the history of Siam and some stories of her life, however, it may be that she never taught the king's children at all and never met the king. I would recommend Anna and the King of Siam for extensive research."
1,terrible experience,Product I received - six cans - was garbage. All I got out of the can was a liquid stream which had little semblance to shaving cream. Total waste. I have written Gillette in an attempt to get replacement product I will let the community know how they respond.
2,Not as good as the gels,I like the gel shave creams better than the foam ones. This stuff is just not as thick an smooth as Gillette's series of gels.
5,review of DVD - lost horizons,movie was good - but it seemed to be incomplete - or else maybe my memory from seeing it years ago is faulty. quality excellent - delivery from Amazon of DVD excellent
3,defective now,"I ordered this thermometer because it beeps every 4 seconds or so. It worked fine, I had to use it every day, but it quit working, the ""ON"" button got stuck in the ""on"" position due to the protective sleeve it presses the ""ON"" button in when you quitt using it. Now I would like to get full refund if possible without to have to return this meter. I am 89 years old, have no car to go to the post office, the whole price is only about $ 10.00, need advise. Wilhelm Eck (I have lung problems and have to take my temparatur daily."
4,I was very impressed with this thermometer! Most ...,"I was very impressed with this thermometer! Most digital thermometers are hard, which makes it difficult to hold under your tongue. My daughter had no trouble holding this one under her tongue. I compared the temperature readings with that of a regular thermometer and the readings were always accurate -- a plus for a digital thermometer! I'd definitely recommend this for anyone -- especially someone with younger children."
4,Good for naps and outings,"We use cloth training pants most of the time with our 22 month old, but have found these useful for naps and bedtime or if we are on an outing.(easier to change if an accident were to occur) The tear away sides helped with changing accidents and if you realized that she didn't have one, you can put them back on, no waste. The feel wet liner has helped my daughter recognize immediately when she has had an accident. In the early potty training days the characters were a motivater as well. She needed to keep Cinderella dry. Good product."
3,Kathleen rocks my world,"This single was kind of a ""waste"" being that all the tracks except one are on either of their 2 albums, (self-titled or From the Desk of Mr Lady), but as a hardcore fan of Kathleen Hanna... i had to buy it. If she put out a CD of herself reciting the dictionary, i'd buy it.. you know how it is. Unless, yr a hardcore fan, stick to the 2 albums."
5,Solid Practical Advice,"This book will not teach you to manage, but it will take you through 101 common scenarios and briefly discuss how to deal with them. It will improve your management skills.The best thing about this book is that each ""topic"" is only one page long. You can read it in your short breaks because you can start and stop with no lost context. In this sense, it is perfect for improving your management when you don't have time to wade through a 300 page book on a single topic."
5,EXCELLENT!!!!,"Dream Theater is one of my favorite bands because the instrumentals are espectacular but i always think what would happen if James LaBrie gets fired?? NOTHING, because dream theater are basically the other members, but man!!, Winter Rose rocks!, and in this band James really demonstrates his potencial, James, please make more albums with Winter Rose It's a MUST HAVE ALBUM!!!!"
4,SOLID TV,I bought this TV solely for HD gaming for my 360. It is a very solid performer. The colors are vivid and bright. The blacks are the best one can find in an HDTV....It does have some minor faults though... Very mild bowing exists and text gets a little fuzzy on the periphery of the screen.This TV really shines with HD cut scenes in video games....STUNNING!!!
4,brilliant in comparison,"first off, i got my set for 720 dollars, same price as the 27"" 4:3 model. so i have no room to complain. obviously the quality and features wont match the 2 grand XBR series sony, but for the price and compared to its counterparts, its absolutely brilliant! very easy to use, enough audio/video enhancements and inputs. plus its a sony, you just cant beat its quality. pick this one up to start you off in hd, then in a few years, you can get the XBR when its reasonably priced! oh and also, didnt see much of a difference between the HDMI and component input running LOTR: Return of the King."
1,A Stick With Padded Ends. Buy a Dowel at Home Depot Instead,"I received my Wrist Wand today and found that I am the victim of a hoax. The Wrist Wand is nothing more than 10"" of PVC pipe with plastic ends and padding. There is no magic in this product that comes with simple stretching exercises that are just common sense. The United States Govenment has been duped also and has awarded a patent to the miracle snake oil stick with padded ends.I am sure that millions went into the research and development of the earth shattering, life changing, product. I fail to see the results of this research and development.Rather than return the Wrist Wand I will keep it as a monument to my stupidity. I was hoping that the Wrist Wand was manufactured in America so that my insanity had at least given a poor American a job but alas PVC and labor is cheaper in Taiwan."
3,Too leaky for my son,"I had really hoped these would work. My son is approx. 18 lbs and gets woken up every night in the middle of the night because his jammies and sheets are soaked. They are good up to about 5 hours, but no longer for him. I think the problem is more that the pee trickles out the back of the diaper before it has a chance to soak in. He even sleeps on a slight incline because he gets stuffy sinuses at night. I think the Huggies Supreme are a bit more absorbent, but those don't work for him at night either."
5,no more wet baby,"thank god for these diapers, can't find them in any stores near me. my daughther started using these at four months when she was sleeping through the night. before i got them she woke up soaked every morning. NO MORE !!!"
2,auto shades,I did not know that they would be so flimsy. Otherwise I am happy. I really should have bought the larger size. My error.
1,"Bad fit, especially for smaller ears","This brand of bluetooth earpiece does not provide a snug fit to the ear, more particularly for a woman's ear, which is smaller. Try using a wrap around unit that goes down the back of the ear as opposed to across the top as this one does. The HS810 literally fell from my ear if I tilted my head, and never had a good fit even sitting still.I would recommend another blue tooth option. Jabra has a nice one."
2,"Ok performance, crappy charging.","This unit works ok enough for most users. Except one thing.You can only reliably charge it three times.When the battery runs out, you're supposed to shut it off, and plug it in. At this point, the light is supposed to come on until it's charged (about 2 hours). After the first three times, it won't come on. Won't charge. Motorola says ""Oh we're so sorry--we only have a 90 day warranty on that..."" Cingular is like ""Oh it's over 30 days...""The only way I have found I can charge it?Turn it on. Wait for the ""I'm on"" light to come on--plug it in, turn it off. THEN it charges.I suggest going with another headset."
5,Great Bluetooth Headset!!!!,"I love this headset! Not only it is light and comfortable to wear, but it's also stylish. The volume level is fantatic and the sound is very clear. I had tried Jabra BT250 and it was so staticky that I had to return it. I live and work in NYC, and you can hear the voice clearly even with noisy background. I highly recommend this product - BTW, my phone is Sony Ericsson T637."
2,Volume is too low,"This might be the most comfortable BlueTooth headset out thereHowever, I've been very upset with connection speeds and call volumeMost people say that they can hear me very well ----- however, the connection speeds take forever to establish ---- in addition, the call volume is simply too low to even use it regularlyI use a Treo 650 --- I've heard that this headset works excellently with Moto products - your mileage may vary.....UPDATE: I have also tried the Moto 850 ---- sadly, it is really no better than the 810 --- there are some volume improvements, but the volume is simply too low on my Treo 650 ---- I recommend the Scala 500"
2,Battery life??????????????????????????????????????????,An eighty dollar headset. I did all the research and was impressed by battery life etc. But when we talk about battery life we should be talking about how long it lasts also. Well I bought it in September 04 and it is May 2005. It doesn't work anymore and I take care of my things. When you spend your $80.00 remember it is a disposable headset. I did use it though and that's why I gave it 2 stars.
4,"Missing Merchandise ""In Box""","What's in the box [WAS NOT all there!]: Motorola HS810 Bluetooth Headset, Neck Strap, Travel Charger, Carry Case, User Manual, and Quick Start Guide.My order did not have a Carry Case or Neck Strap and it is unclear to me how to report this back to Amazon. Their process of communicating with them about an order is seriously flawed.Also, when I ordered this item I also ordered two car chargers. The promise date was changed significantly without Amazon telling me or sending my HS810 ahead [since it was in stock] and absorbing the extra shipping cost, since the problem was one that they created. I placed my order on 4/11 and it arrived a few minutes ago [4/28].Amazon's Quality Assurance and Customer Service have dropped significantly in the last year and I will look seriously for other vendors who have a higher customer service level and who deliver what is offered without the hassle required for the customer to get what they ordered in a timely manner."
2,"Cool design, but sound quality poor","With my RIM 7290 the HS810 is barely audible in other than a quiet setting. Listeners also complain about outgoing sound as ""muffled.""Features and design are great, but sound quality isn't good enough to substitute an in-the-ear headset other than in very quiet surroundings"
5,The Mature Mind: The Positive Power of the Aging Brain,"Great read. Gave one hope that no matter what our age, we can expand our mental abilities as well as hold onto our thinking and reasoning skills."
4,"informative, interesting",I discovered that I know a lot of what is in this book from my own experiences. I didn't realize that it was documented in studies. I am enjoying reading this book and would like to talk to the author to tell my personal story. I don't know how to contact him.
1,Very disappointed,I was charged for this item and never received it; it is out of print and I can't seem to get someone at Amazon to issue a credut.Guy Lemieux(819) 843-5006
5,Does this even need A review?,I've always used Vicks products. This one is a staple in our home during flu season. The vapors it releases are very soothing and helps calm your cough and other symptoms. I reccomend it used with any of their humidifiers or vaporizers.
1,Worst product,"this is just a cheap alcoholic product with no ingredients to help with cough or breathing. I recently used it with a Vicks Kaz Humidifer as demostrated in the product. However, instead of helping my wife sleep better who was having cough and stuffy nose, it gave me a cough and a hard time breathing. I felt suffocated because of the awful smell of alcohol and had to flush the humidifier and open the room windows and door to let fresh cold air come in and make it better.I do not understand how can this product claim to have camphor when none of the liquid in it smells even close to camphor."
5,A must have,"Yodi is my hero. After I had seen the movie I just had to get my own Yoda. This toy comes with his own miniature lightsaber(which stays in his hand pretty well but could be better, and comes apart kinda easily, which at first was cool, but then got frustrating), a walking stick(doesn't stay in his hand at all, and if it does, it isn't touching the ground), and a large column thingy (that makes a great stand, and which part of it snaps off so Yoda can ""use the force"" with the additional blue force thing). I think you can get the cape off if you tryed, but if you did the arms would be a different color so I don't want to anyway.kinda movable at the waist and also moveable at the shoulders and neck. Great fun!!! I wanted to give it a 10 for fun..........oh well!!"
5,Size matters not!,"At last we discover why they call him The Master! Yoda is ready to lay down the Jedi law with his mini-lightsaber in the palm of his little green hand! ""Judge me by my size, do you?"" Yoda also fires blue ""Force"" lightning from his hand with the wrap-around accessory. Also includes an elevating platform to simulate his levitation with the Force and enable you to re-enact his final confrontation with Count Dooku. With that mean looking scowl on his otherwise cute green face, you know Yoda means to do some serious business! A word to the Wise: Never tick off a Jedi Master! Yoda is figure #23 in Collection 1 from Star Wars: Attack of the Clones."
1,Not What I Ordered,"The bowl was not as advertised. I ordered from one of the companies represented by Amazon, a grass green bowl to go with the pastel decor of the gift recipient but received dark green.Nothing I've ordered from these associated companies has been as advertised. One ""new"" book had writing inside, and another was coming apart at the binding."
1,Therapy,"The only thing this book is missing is a guide to the therapy you'll need when you fail to succeed. Many of the successes have turned to failure--you can succeed for a year or two, then you're out of businesses. These folks are charlatans of the worst kind. They encourage you to take great risks, come around to get your story, but are no where to be found when the governor or mayor or vice president leave office."
4,"Helpfull information, wide coverage, excelent ilustrations","This is the first book I read on this breed, it is has lots of helpfull information, covering various aspects of the dog, including puppy care, training, health, breed standard, and more. I found it very interesting to read plus it has got very good ilustrations, prime photographs let you see how the dog looks in different situations. Without doubt I recommend it, however it does not go in much detail in some areas, as it only has 64 pages."
4,Great Child Seat,"My 6 month old like this child seat better then the other convertible one that we have. It also have the LATCH child safety setup, great with my wife's car. Would give a 5 star if it has more padding."
3,"Pretty good, not great.","We needed a narrow car seat so that we could put three car seats side by side for our 5 year old, 3 year old, and infant. This one is nice and slim. It seems to have good cushioning. It has a pad that is supposed to function as a ""spill guard"" that the child sits on. However, this spill guard doesn't snap or velcro down - it basically floats free.The strap for the bottom buckle doesn't adjust. There is only one slot for it, unlike on other car seats. This means that as your child grows you won't be able to adjust the strap (although the shoulder straps do have several different heights)."
2,Don't bother,"I bought this for my daughter for her second birthday after watching her play with a friend's doll nursery. I thought it would be better than an individual swing, bed, highchair etc., but I was wrong. It's an awkward size, and the swing is horrible -- the doll's legs constantly hit the bar underneath when my daughter pushes the swing, and the swing squeaks. I wouldn't spend the money on this piece. I recommend getting a more compact nursery set, or the sets with individual pieces."
4,Shockinglg good,"Machiavelli was a master philosopher in the art of ruthless politics. His insights are spot on, shocking but absolutely true. If ever you wanted a view on the human condition when the stakes are high.Something every nation considering an invasion of another should read: ""in entering a province one has always need of the goodwill of the natives."""
5,Infinity Instruments clock,"I love this clock. It is great looking, easy to read, quiet and looks very retro. Highly recommended."
1,It Doesn't Run,"We FINALLY finished the kitchen remodel and the finishing touch was hanging the new Retro Clock.How disappointing to discover that it doesn't work. We tried different batteries, even from different packs, to be sure...But it just plain won't run. And we didn't save the mailing box. Phooey. Sending it back!"
3,Nice but rough.,I had to do a lot of sanding and then dye them before I could use them on an antique dresser restoration project. Otherwise they fit the bill.
3,Not much competition,"This manual is a good buy for it's purpose, but do not trust it completely. Some of the information is incorrect or missing because GM changed design and features almost every year. For example: great detail for the engine controls but NO wiring diagrams for the instrument panels. However, even the much more expensive factory service manuals for these cars are not always correct. FYI, this manual is almost identical to the Haynes version. The differences are mostly type size and image placement positions. Bigger type and more white space for notes in the this version, smaller type and lower cost in the Haynes manual. Your choice."
4,Battle On The Bay,"I am a civil war re-enactor who lives in the Houston/Galvestion area. I have found Edward T. Gotham's book ""Battle ON The Bay"" a very thoughtfull read. He not only gave the history of the battle of Galveston, but throughly developed the main charactures in this battle which occured New Years day; 1863. I could not put this book down. every page held my attention, and i wondered what the next page contained. Not only did it inform me about the history of the area where i live, but i felt as if i were there living it. i am proud to have this book in my library."
2,I must be the only one who hates this Padme figure...,"I bought this figure the night before I went for my driving test and was verrry disappointed in it. Don't get me wrong, the face looks EXACTLY like Natalie's, and I like her and all, but this figure is a disgrace to her. Where do I begin with the problems? For one thing, she is much smaller than the other figures, her head is too small for her body, and compared to my Ep1 Padmés, she is shorter and not just with her legs in the ""battle stance"", I mean her whole body is misproportioned, as with the Obi Wan Coruscant Chase figure. The other pathetic thing about this Padmé figure is her right arm that sticks out because of the ""quick draw"" action when you move her waist. The arm doesn't stay down, which is very annoying. After my test the next day, I packaged her up, told the sales rep. she was defective, and got a Taun We in its place. I will now patiently wait for a better scaled with no-sticking-out-right-arm Padmé Amidala figure."
4,This shaver is a great idea. I love ...,"This shaver is a great idea. I love how the blades are built into the whole unit. It saves time and with a twist of the middle, you have a new ready-to-use blade. The only problem I have with this is it doesn't do a very good job shaving. If the maker could improve the blades by making them work a little better or a little sharper, this razor could be an awesome product."
2,Out of date advice.,"Some useful information for interviews , otherwise this book has just common sense information. Some of the tips are completely out of date.I am sure the authors are experts in their field , but skip this one. Very disappointing."
1,poorly categorized-BEWARE,"This film is by no means a comedy, and could use a rating, of some sort.People who liked the film have placed it in the context of the director's other work. There may be a place for it there, but for the 'newbie', it could use some keywords. Here are a few:DRAMA, depictions of underage sex and sex between an adult and a minor; pornography; strong sexual thematic elements [such as pedophilia]; frank discussions about and depictions surrounding the topic of abortion; strong language.If you find these topics, funny, this film is for you."
1,NO STARS! Totally disatisfied and frustrated!,I recently purchased this product. After 8 hours on the phone with a variety of technicians I was ready to pull my hair out. I was never able to successfully download this program. The technicians were conveniently warning me that they were having system challenges...then they would conveniently drop me!! I wouldn't advise purchase of this product. I wish I had read all the reviews before trying. I'm trying to get my money back...we'll see.
2,Watch out for incompatibility with wireless devices,"Generally I like Macfee, have used it for years. But there is a nasty problem with VS7 Home edition (likely similar for other editions) where, after installing a USB *or* PCMCIA 802.11b wireless card and rebooting, you lose TCP/IP - ALL networking dies. (You get a message called ""Mobile Devices Properties - the TCP/IP Transport is not installed""). This led me down all kinds of bad paths (looks like a networking, driver, or activesync problem) and FINALLY saw here on Amazon that there might be a conflict with Mcafee. Deinstalled it and now all is fine, except that I'm riding the Internet bareback. I was getting a little tired of all the noisy updating and ""look, I'm here, still watching for viruses"" messages and resource drains anyway. I guess I'll just be more vigilant with attachments, though for the price I can't complain, except all the lost time was frustrating."
2,Looks good on paper but didn't work for me,"I bought Ver 7.0 (free on mail-n-rebate)from BestBuy, took home & it appeared to be getting ready to install. Install screen came & then it jumped to an error saying Autorun failed. Tried everything per manual, won't install. Store gave me second CD & didn't get install screen this time & got Autorun error. I had ver 4.0 mcafee on my system. Store asked me to contact Mcafee. I was on hold for 30mins & hung-up. Then phone said will charge me by time if I need tech support. Asked the store to show whether this CD would install on any test PC they have & would go further than the install screen. I told them if they could show this I can take the s/w & talk to Mcafee. They turn down this suggestion & finally offered me Norton Antivirus 2003 (Hang type pack, not box) for 29.99. Took home put the CD in, BOOM!, Bingo! everything was cool. Now I use Norton AV 2003. By the way I'm 40."
1,software loads but automatically disabled,"I though i'd give mcafee another try after using norton for a few years now.NAV installs fine, but it can't seem to stay active. even after clicking on the activation button.it's junk"
1,Bad Product. Bogus Rebate.,"Don't buy McAfee ever. At least I won't. 1000 words may not be enough for a review. Bad product. You need to manually uninstall previous versions, otherwise God help you. 1 year expiration is so well enforced that it can cause your O/S to go bad, I had to reinstall my Win2K. And updates to McAfee products are more frequent than even Microsoft. And if you have a dialup, don't even think McAfee, imagine downloading 10-13M files every 15 days. And DAT files are updated in bunches of 30-40. Firewall is so good that even if you ask it to remember some program to allow, it still asks you, very loyal firewall really. And try updating all components at the same time, and watch the fun of rebooting.Even if you can live with all this, their REBATE is BOGUS. Either McAfee cheats or Amazon is lying re the rebate. I sent the older version CD as proof of upgrade, and I sent the only UPC on my box. It seems that is still not enough. McAfee seems to have an old habit of rejecting rebates."
1,Danger Will Robinson!...,"I was a big fan of McAfee until this version. I have used VirusScan 4,5,6 and now 7. Well, version 7 finally did it. I have a Windows 2000 machine and it totally killed my boot log and I can no longer boot into Windows. I will have to reinstall all of my software, etc. I am a computer consultant that builds computers, networks and custom applications for customers and this will cost me hundreds of dollars in lost time. DO NOT INSTALL!... Warning! It will crash your system. Beware!I guess I will have to become a Norton fan......although NAV Corporate Edition does rock!"
1,Planned Obsolescence,"Product installed fine, but it appears I cannot download any updates (particularly of virus definitions) without paying more money. Everytime I boot I get at least two different prompts to update, but when I attempt to do so, I get redirected to a mcafee web page with prices for a 1 year subscription to updates. I would think I would get 1 year of updates for free as part of the cost of the product... When I emailed Mcafee about this, I got no response, but a few days later, Satmetrix emailed me asking me to taking a survey about my support experience...grrr."
1,Even for free--it's too much trouble!,I used VirusScan for some time and had a number of problems with other program's not running. It also prevented internet access at times. I tried to get tech support but they would not help.Have since used AVG (free program) and Norton AV with no problems.
2,Be careful with the mail in rebate,I purchased this software a few months ago and sent in the mail in rebates. I have still not received it. I have switched to Norton since McAfee customer service was less than helpful in sorting out the situation. I wouldn't hold my breath that McAfee would send the rebates.
5,Great space saving item,"I mounted several of these below my cabinet and hang all my coffee cups on them, freeing a large amount of space in my cabinet. These items are sturdy and easy to install."
1,uninformative propaganda,"This is another attempt by Enduring Freedom Productions to sell Bush administration post 9/11 war policies. Use of ambiguous visuals, mood-setting music, incomplete and misleading monologue are means to persuade without informing that US policy is just and well executed. For the record I support US Afghan incursion if not the Bush administration's execution of that policy, so I am not some ideologue venting my nonsense. There is a powerful case that should be made to develop support for our Afghan policies. As long as Bush administration apologists continue to publish this type of pablum, that case will not be presented and the support the policy requires for success will not be realized."
1,Rewind failed when it was just out of warranty,Rewind failed when it was just out of (6 month)warranty. Fixing it is not an option because it cost more than the unit is worth. The remote only works with JVC TVs. Would not buy a JVC VCR again. Does anyone make a reliable VCR any more?
1,Horrible product,"After about 30 days of use, this unit ate tapes and the timer did not work. After sending it away for 7 weeks to an authorized JVC service location, I got it back and the auto tracking (and the manual tracking for that matter) could not provide acceptable video output. Also, a tape got stuck in the carriage and when I went to pull it out, it caught on the cheap plastic cover on the tape opening and broke it. JVC will only reimburse me for 1/2 of the product cost for a product that I got little to no usage from. Oh well... Stick with Sony."
2,Amateurish,"I couldn't get past page 53. Maybe it gets better; I'll never know. From page one, I was making edits in my head the whole time. It seemed like it was written by a teenager. It was in dire need of pruning -- superfluous words and phrases; stilted sentence structure; vocabulary run amok. Instead of getting into the story, I was focused on the amateurish writing. Why didn't the publisher put an editor to work on this? I enjoyed Deep in the Darkness, but if I'd read Atmosphere first, I never would have picked up another Laimo book."
2,Couldn't finish it.,"It was okay, but not very compelling - but okay doesn't cut it when there are GREAT books out there to be read. I read about 50 pages. Look elsewhere."
4,Good for laymen,"This is an excellent book for laymen trying find out what the bar and politicians are fighting over in interpreting the Constitution. It's clearly written, and does not bog down with the details and legal arguments attorneys prefer (such as with law review articles). Professor Sunstein explains ""original understanding"" and how its adherents apply this method of constitutional interpretation, contrasting it with his preferred method of minimalism. Importantly, he explains the intellectual inconsistency of original understanding and its claim of a ""Constitution in Exile,"" and how its proponents apply it differently depending on the particular question at hand.While the title ""Radicals in Robes"" suggests a polemic, the book fortunately fails to deliver one."
3,A Nice Family Movie,"I watched this film with my wife, and we agreed that it was a nice ""the misguided turns good at Christmas time"" type of movie that you find on family type cable channels. There were some laughs and tears; We did enjoy it."
2,Too much glory,"Too much glory to the Admiral - seems he had everything figured out and the majority of those who did not agree with him were incompetent or just plain stupid. I did not care to hear of his drinking or womanizing exploits - not certain what those ""abilities"" have to do with being an admiral. A Navy Patton???Feel the author spends too much verse in glamorizing Clark and down grading the other Naval heros of the era."
1,The worst of FIFA yet,"I have played EA-FIFA since 1995. Always liked it more or less, but this version is an absolute waste of money. Why? For me, the biggest dissapointment is the fact that there are on 6 leagues available. Where is the rest of Europe? Where are 2nd and 3rd divisions? But I also agree with all the other issues mentioned in the other review. No trick moves, iffy game controlls, uncontrolable moves and actions, unstable on-line mode with boring opponents (not much to choose from if you have only 6 leagues)I would definitly NOT reccommend spending the money for a new game."
3,"Fun, but no one online and very few modes","Fun game. I just bought it to play my bro online. There are very few modes and couldn't seem to play xbox live on the same team to play another team, which sucked. Pretty good game. It is kind of old, so understand at the time I am writing this hardly anyone plays it online, but still decent value."
1,horrible,"Its seems in this day and age of video games, that the actual gameplay and options would increase. Well that is not the case. Gameplay is difficult and the game only has 5 leagues. What a waste of money."
3,"Read with an open mind, Cowboys fans!","I have definitely read my share of interesting COWBOYS books in my lifetime. One in particular; I HATE THE DALLAS COWBOYS, AND WHO ELECTED THEM AMERICA'S TEAM ANYWAY by BERT SUGAR. I did start reading it with an open mind (letting the chosen speakers voice their opinions), but after a while, I realized that these CHOSEN SPEAKERS were chosen because, for one reason or another, they weren't as good as the DALLAS COWBOYS! Speakers like former Falcons QB Steve Bartkowski, obviously burned because the Cowboys kept knocking them out of the playoffs every year they were good enough to make it!Although I DID finish reading the book, I ended up writing (at the start of each new speaker section) their particular reason why they didn't like the COWBOYS....in my eyes. THAT made reading it MORE FUN!!!!!"
1,RETARDED BOOK,"THIS GUY IS ONE DENSE, OVER-OPINIONATED REJECT. A TYPICAL AMERICAN FAN WITH NOTHING TO DO BUT TALK B.S. ABOUT SUBJECTS HE DOESN""T UNDERSTAND."
3,It Was All Right,I would recommend it for Dallas Cowboys Haters over the age of 40. Younger readers might not get it.
4,This product provided a very close shave. It ...,"This product provided a very close shave. It could lather a bit easier, but overall gives a better shave than the Gillette Series shaving gel. It has a pleasant smell, unlike some shaving gels, and it has no filmy residue."
3,pretty light,"The chapters on sex are much more interesting than the chapters on love. Even so, Baxtrer only traipses into the history of sex by dint of a buddy who keeps the topic alive between them. It's kind of a glancing blow off the topic. The only sex discussed are the eddies related to, and trailing off of specific conversations.I don't understand why every guy who writes, who has working sex organs, and knocks someone up in Paris, writes about the event as if it were an event I need to know about. I really don't need to know where his daughter was conceived; and functioning sex organs are not as exceptional as they seem to the owner. Look around.This is, apparently, another hazard of living in France; writing about your succesful reproduction as it it were of interest to others. He might have saved said daughter the humiliation of the event's inscription.See also Adam Gopnik ""Paris to the Moon"" which is overall a more successful book."
2,Lacked direction,"This book jumped around. There were interesting parts, but it was a hard to stay interested to the end."
5,I love Huggies,"I used Huggies with my first child and never had a problem with leaking, rashes, or irritations. I've recently had my second baby and tried Luvs and Pampers because they were a little cheaper. Pampers leaked quite a bit. This caused me to have to change her clothes and sheets in the middle of the night. It could have just been bad timing but when I tried Luvs she developed a pretty bad rash. I have only used Huggies from here on out. No rashes...no leaks...just a happy baby!"
4,Wonderful,These diapers were perfect for my preemie son and he wore these until he was six months. The sides were stretchy and I had no problems with leaks unlike Pampers n Luvs. My only gripe was that the tabs would rip off too easily and they were velcro unlke the sticky tabs of Pampers. Buy these up if you have a slim baby (preemie or newborn) but don't go haywire if you have a chubby baby because they will grow out of these too quickly. I saw both and speak from experience.Our family loves Huggies and will keep using them as long as we have children! YOU ROCK HUGGIES!
5,A GREAT way to earn to play the Blues,"I've bought several guitar books over my years of playing guitar. I am used to finding one or two ""good"" things in each book to keep and use. This book is completely different - I have learned an used every exercise. Each exercise is excellent with great licks - starts with easy ones and proceeds through some more challenging ones.If you want to learn to play blues guitar this is definitely the one to go with, you won't be disappointed. I found John Ganape's web site and was pleased to see that he also has published ""more Blues You Can Use"" and ""Licks"" I have ordered them both."
2,Seemed good but was misprinted - missing chapters!,"Seemed good until I noticed that it skipped from chapter 5 to chapter 10. There were multiple chapters repeated and multiple chapters missing. I'm trying to exchange it now through Amazon, hopefully this was an isolated incident."
5,Blues You Can Use,It is a very good book and cd. It takes you from strumming rhythms to playing single note rhythms. It explains the theory behind scales and lead breaks in a easily digested program. Glad I bought this one. It has taken from beginner into an intermediate area of expertise. A well conceived structured course.
4,these are fun,"The super battle droids are very cool figures. they're great for armies and are fun. Standing them up can sometimes be tricky, but it's not too difficult. I don't like that putting him together is quite difficult. He is very good. Get him."
1,Forced Copy Protection slows down transfers.,"Nice looking unit but the software that you HAVE to use to get music on it is awful. It forces you to convert every mp3 to Sony's format. Then, once you get it on the player, you can only transfer it back to the original computer you copied it from in the first place.This is sony's form of copy protection and it makes transfering music to the unit painful.I returned mine and purchased another brand that does not force copy protection on you at your time expense."
4,WONDERFULL LITTLE PLAYER,"I bought this walkman, watched the tutorial on the softwear before I even opend the product and have had no promlems whatso ever, except i bought it to use at the gym and apparently sony thinks everyone is right handed, so the left ear bud has no cord at all! but i got diffrent ear phones and i love it, the sound qaulity is great, and while the software takes alittle while to load everything, it isnt all that bad.But can someone please tell me how to set my favorite stations to the preset on the radio?This is a great little product and alot cheaper then the i pod and i like it alot better, the ipoddosnt even have the radio!"
3,Disorganized the book somewhat was but covered it topic the well!,"As my title hinted....""The book was somewhat disorganized but it covered the topic well!"" I am a student of Presidential History in my retirement and looked forward to adding this book to my collection. As I type this, I have finished about 1/2 of the book. We have jumped from the early security of the President/White House up to the Reagan shooting in DC in the 1980's, but now, we are back to the early days of Monroe, Lincoln, Adams. There just seems no rhyme or reason for the lay out of this book. Sorry guys....it just doesn't cut it!"
4,"I normally don't use gel, but I may ...","I normally don't use gel, but I may change that habit after testing this product. The gel foamed up really well and gave me a good shave. Didn't have to use too much to get it to foam up well. It had a nice trigger mechanism, except that some gel would continue to leak out after using."
5,I loved this product. The shaving cream was ...,"I loved this product. The shaving cream was easy to use and did an excellent job. I'll definitely buy this product again, as it worked so much better than my current brand. I'll be sure to recommend it to all of my family and friends as an excellent shaving cream!"
1,Bad ingredients,"Bought the Balsamic Vinaigrette and the Italian dressing before I looked at the ingredients. Although the taste is good, wow, was I shocked when I saw these products contain ""HIGH FRUCTOSE CORN SYRUP"" and ""SOYBEAN OIL,"" both of which are now known to be detrimental to your health! If you care about your well-being, don't buy these products!!!"
4,Delightful salads again!!,"I love salad dressing, not only for salads but also for dipping many other things. They are so high in calories though and I wanted to prune some of the ""excess"" things that I don't consider really filling like high calorie condiments. I hate fat-free dressings, they are mostly sugar and too much spice flavoring but these are delightful. I haven't tried them all yet but the balsamic vinegar is my favorite with the ranch a close second. The ranch is a little stronger tasting than the creamy flavor that I so adore but still very good and not at all like the flavor of fat-free dressing. These would get five stars if it weren't for the high fructose corn syrup in the ingredients, it's one of those things that I think is overused but for the amount of flavor in so few calories they are still getting four stars and a thumbs up."
3,"Not even close to 3.75"" tall","This little R2D2 is super cute and well done, but I have no idea why it is described as being 3.75"" tall as it isn't even three according to my ruler. I'm sure this will be liked by the recipient anyway, but I was looking for something a little bit bigger. Oh well."
3,The Bare Necessities,"If you transfer the information on to your i-pod and listen to the audio files on your daily commute, the very cheesy songs and basic vocabulary are a good first step for someone looking to learn the basics. You won't be able to string together complex sentences but it may just give you the confidence you need to take further classes or get the advanced learning cd's."
5,Does anyone know the color of this thing?,The picture is the same as the NW-E507 (it looks silver). But I thought the NW-E407 was black only.
2,The product that was sent to me had a 37 day shelf date,"I recently purchased a case of Barbars wheatines containing 12, 9 ounce boxes. The package arrived on June 3, and is not returnable. I bought this case because this product is hard to find in the store. My problem is, that this is at least a 6 months' supply for me and the boxes have an expiration date of July 10th, 2010. I tasted a box and they are indeed going to expire on that date. This is unacceptable to me. I think amazon should give me a refund of some kind as I did not intend to purchase crackers that were ready to expire or send me some that have a longer shelf date.I wil never purchase a food product again from amazonBarbara's Bakery Lightly Salted Tops Wheatines, 9-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)"
2,This toy is not that good,"This toy was not that good at all. The light saber comes out of anakin's arm, so you can't bend it. The light saber is also too short, compared to others. Overall, I was really really disappointed when I got this figure."
2,This one needs some work,"This was my first AOTC figure, and I think it needs some work. First off, I removed it and tried the ""Force"" action with him opening a box and the blaster rise into his hand and was disappointed. I got it to work ONCE, and then the blaster got lost in the box. I hate the way he's holding his lightsaber because he can't fight with it. He just holds it. The handle is molded to his hand to allow the blade to extend from his arm and then through the handle. The poncho allows no movement at all. It also looks nothing like Hayden. I ended up packaging this one up and exchanging it (to my BIG SURPRISE) for Hangar Duel Anakin Skywalker!! ..."
4,Works well for the price,"The advertised range seems about right for direct line of sight. I use this keyboard on the second floor and the computer is one floor below, about 10-15 feet away. It's not as good as the more expensive Gyration keyboard, but it works well as a remote control for my entertainment PC."
5,Wireless Keyboard is A+++,"I purchased this to use in the living room as I relax surfing the Interent on my 47"" Visio LCD television from the other side of the room.In terms of appearance, nothing special there, but its functionality is great as far as my wife and I are concerned. The trackball is completely adjustable via Windows Control Panel and the keyboard itself is small enough to fit comfortably in your lap. It even has a scroll wheel and button to navigate like a scroll mouse without the pains of using an actual mouse. For a portable wireless keyboard this perfectly suits our needs. No drivers needed, just plug and play!"
5,Nice keyboard,No problems with this unit. The instructions is the only thing that is in need of some revisions.
2,Too bulky,"My neck hurts after listening to these for a while.Also the volume control is funky. Every time you start it, the volume starts out at a deafening level.Sound quality is so-soOverall I regret buying these."
2,rip off,"I'm sorry I know the review is supposed to be about the item, but I had to let people know that with a little research, this exact set is being sold on amazon as a ""Kempston"" template guide set for almost half the price, $26. I know because I bought it and just checked and the other is still available. For what it's worth, so far the kit is working well. If the Kempston is not available, then I'd say $46 is too much to pay for this and you should get a set from a name brand for that price."
1,Song Without End,"The quality of this "" new "" product was extremely poor .The video looked as though it had been reproduced by sitting in a picture theatre and filming what was on the screen with a low definition consumer video camera."
1,What dissapointment !!,"I have an old VSR of this movie and is so beautiful,so I bought DVD,What dissapointment.Pictures are blur and colors are faint,plus the scenes are missing."
1,Quality of this DVD's clarity,"We have recently bought this DVD from Amazon as the clarity of the picture is shocking, it is out of focus most of the time! The subtitles in English are absolutely incorrect and bizarre. At the same time we bought another classic DVD and it was perfect. Very disappointing! Perhaps we have received a bad copy. Is there anything that can be done about this."
2,BUY THE VHS INSTEAD,"I WAS BARELY 10 MINUTES INTO THE MOVIE WHEN I NOTICED (I HAD THE VHS; WHEN I GOT THE DVD I SENT THE VHS TO MY SISTER...WHAT A MISTAKE!)A KEY SCENE WAS NOT THERE..AND, I AM SPEAKING OF ABOUT 5 MINUTES OF LIZST ON A CHURCH ORGAN AND THE DUST-UP AND DECISION THAT FOLLOWED. SO, WHEN HE NEXT APPEARS AT A CONCERT HALL, YOU WONDER WHY. FORGET ABOUT THE DVD UNLESS...AND I AM NOT SURE MORE SCENES HAVE NOT BEEN CUT AS I STOPPED TO WRITE THIS REVIEW SOON AS I SAW THAT AT LEAST ONE SCENE WAS GONE...YOU DO NOT WANT THE WHOLE MOVIE. WHAT A WASTE!! I WILL BE SELLING DVD AS SOON AS I CAN FIND A NEW/USED VHS!"
1,Not much fortune,I thought I was purchasing a casino version not the gameshow version. It did not keep my interest and was only played once.
2,The Guide To Owning A Great Dane,The book had some really great glossy pictures. I did not think the book was very informative it sort of touched on different subjects but nothing in depth it was VERY basic. It did not help me on my decision on whether or not to add a Great Dane to my family. I am considering getting a Great Dane and this book was not helpful at all except to show me some very nice pictures of some gorgeous dogs and puppies. It was a nice read but not very helpful or informative.
5,Great family fun!,"Star Wars fans and puzzle fans get double the pleasure with this great collector edition. With 500 pieces, it's guaranteed to relieve summer or weekend boredom for the kids, and the artwork is appealing to adult puzzle fiends. The tin adds to the value, since it's harder to lose the pieces!"
2,Star Wars puzzle,"The pieces are too small for someone 8 or less. With double-sided, makes it also difficult to find pieces."
3,Not the same,"I used Buf Pufs for many years and loved them. Then I could no longer find them in stores. I had to purchase six of them from Amazon. Too expensive - Not happy about thatI've been using the first from that purchase for about a month now. They are not made of the same stuff as they were in the past. It has flattened out and seems almost as if it is disintegrating. The old Buf pufs lasted for months - six months, easily. This one is ready to be tossed.Why would they mess with a quality product and also make it difficult to purchase? Women need to exfoliate their skin. Men exfoliate when they shave. Buf pufs were the best.I purchased one of the generic ones from CVS and it is a poor immitation.I guess I'm pretty lucky if my biggest complaint in life is I'm not happy with my Buf puf - I can handle the big things in life - it's the little things that bug the heck out of me. . . .Jan"
4,Makes great cappuccino but is somewhat of a pain to clean,"I've had it for a week now and I can say:1. The resulting cappuccino tastes great.2. Follow the directions.3. It takes 4 or 5 minutes to clean, compared with 10-15 to make the drink.4. The first two pots tasted bad (metallic)--as others have reported.I wrestled with a pod-style machine (because I am lazy and don't want to clean it every day) but decided in favor of simplicity (few moving parts). I would buy it again; I hope it lasts."
4,Very Happy...,"I'm very pleased with this product, although there was a bit of a learning curve involved. At first, I was having problems with coffee coming out of the pot where the top and bottom are screwed together while the pot was heating on the stove. I was able to stop this from happening by wetting the seals before screwing the pot together. I don't know why this works, but I haven't had any problems since. Overall, this pot is very quick and easy to use. I use vanilla soy milk and sometimes add hot cocco mix to make a mocha. It tastes great!"
1,I really wanted to like it but I didn't,"I never wrote a review before, but I just need to do this. I got this for Christmas and was very excited. What a great idea! I made the first pots and threw them out as directed, then started using it. The first 2 times were OK, and then every time that I used it, it leaked all over the stove. I tried everything: made sure no coffee on the rim, tried oiling the gasket as one person suggested, screwed it very carefully together,used a very low flame. No dice. I finally gave up and returned it. In its place, I bought a great gizmo called the Nespresso Aerocino: you put in the milk, press and button and in 50 seconds have heated milk and foam. (p.s.: when I spoke to folks at Williams Sonoma about the Mokka Express, they said that when the company came in to do a demo, the pot exploded.)"
2,"Good idea, but poor execution","I love the idea. And, when I have put everything together properly, I like the result. The problem is that, for reasons I cannot quite figure, sometimes I don't put everything together correctly. And then I get leakage on my gas burners. I have tried tightening better, using a lower flame, and making extra sure that edges of the upper and lower parts are nice and clean. And still, somehow, I get it wrong about 1/3 of the time. Maybe I am a dope or just plain mechanically impaired. But even if that is the case, I don't have trouble with any other coffee making devices. So I give up on this, and will return to my Bialetti Moka Express, and use a frother and my microwave to make nice, hot foam. Not only will this be easier, it will also give me more flexibility in tailoring the taste just right."
4,"2 months in, still working","Quite a decent product, although cappuccino is not really what is made, more a latte or very wet cappuccino if you are super careful. But the money you can save.....Things to watch out for:1) there are 2 seals on top & bottom of ground coffee holder, these need to be kept free of grinds as do the mating surfaces, or else it'll leak. If you don't clean them, the grinds can bake on, and be difficult to shift.2) wash the pressure thing every time right away, upside down in a stream of water so it spurts out and washes through.3) It does best job at frothing if at the time of actual frothing, the heat isn't too high: if too high, it'll bubble to vigorously and so not fine froth. You can, if you have gas, turn it down just before this happens, so get peed & good froth.4) It is a cheap machine, and works fine on a value per dollar basis, but don't expect the kind of result it takes 100 to 1000 dollar machines to achieve."
5,Awesome!,"I got my mukka about two months ago, and though the price was pretty steep, it was definitely well worth it. I use it everyday and get darn good cappuccino without using a bulky, intricate machine. The frother works very well, though it is not the 'cleanest' froth you would get by frothing the milk by itself, since the milk is steamed/frothed essentially by the espresso pushed through the valve at high pressure.Only downside to this is you must keep your eye on it. It will boil over in a heartbeat, so have your cup ready and listen for the sound of the valve popping. Do not use unattened. Ever. Even so, I still LOVE this cappuccino maker!"
2,Sorry it didn't work for me either,"As a regular stove-top espresso drinker with many bialetti's in my kitchen, I also wanted this product to work very much, read all the reviews and was prepared to be patient and to try many times. Unfortunately, over the course of using it every day for 2 months and getting about 20/100 good cups of cappucino-like beverage, I ended up returning it not because I wasn't willing to continue figuring out why it often leaked all over the place, wasn't hot enough, didn't froth, burnt coffee, or didn't make enough espresso, but rather because it stopped working entirely!! The machine just refused to pump espresso up no matter how much troubleshooting I dutifully attempted. The 20 cups I did manage to make were pretty good, but really I tried every variation of the steps and after wasting so much of my precious bean...really who has the time for this? Really disappointing."
1,Save your money,"I've followed the instructions carefully each time. About 1 time out of 10, I have a decent cup of cappuccino. The rest of the time, I have spills (despite tightening the pieces carefully) or just steamed milk. It's a pain to clean up as well. I recommend saving your money and buying a better quality product."
1,mukka express: not worth time or trouble,This Mukka express is horrible. It leaks all over the place. Using this product actually made me appreciate my walks and the $4 I would spend at the local coffee store for a nice cappuccino. This product is not worth the time or effort. I spend more time wiping up the leak all over my stove than I do drinking the luke warm watery substance they claim should be cappuccino.
1,Does NOT make real latte OR cappuccino!,"While the machine mechanically functions as it says it will, the end result tastes NOTHING like a real cappuccino or latte should taste. It is a watered down version that is poorer than 7-11 cappuccino when it first came out (how many?) 20 years ago. Seriously, the taste is weak and horrible, and the consistency of the milk is nowhere near the thick creaminess of a real foamed latte. We ditched this complete waste of money after about 10 uses and went with a Bodum manual (stovetop) milk frother combined with the original Bialletti espresso maker (the old-school one), which is a wonderful combination."
3,Bad Luck on Electric Stove,"I purchased this cappuccino maker when I lived in a house that had a gas cook top. It worked great and produced creamy, frothy drinks time and time again (that is, when I was careful to wipe away excess coffee grounds from the lip and screw on the lid tightly). Well, unfortunately we moved and have an electric cook top now. I've tried various heat levels and even tried putting the Mukka Express on when the stove top had a chance to heat up first, but I've never been able to produce a cappuccino anywhere close to those on the gas top...they come out more like a latte. I used mine for 6 months and returned it to W-S (abbreviated for a well-known kitchen store). I'd recommend making sure who you buy it from will take it back even after you've tried it out. Good Luck! When it works, it's heaven!"
3,hit and miss,"when it makes coffee, it's great. when the top doesn't work (which is often) it's a bust. a lot of money for lousy reliability"
2,AWFUL at high altitude,"Everyone says this thing is great, but for me its the most frustrating, messy p.o.s coffee maker I've ever used. The only thing I can think of is that I'm at 7000 ft. If I set the temperature on my range too low, then it takes upwards of 20 minutes. If I set it too high, it shoots hot milk all over my range. I'm still trying to narrow down the right temperature through a process of trial and (very messy) error. It's somewhere between 4.5 and 5, to give you an idea of how unforgiving this thing is."
3,for the price it's pretty good,"When it works well, the capuccino is quite good. Sometimes it's frustrating to get everything aligned, screwed in correctly, filled to the line, pushed down for capuccino, and it might not froth just right. I guess I'm still working out the kinks to get it right. Then there's the cleaning! Watch out for the handle. I guess it's still better than a large counter top device for hundreds more."
1,Impossible to close tightly... Makes a mess!!!,"It is impossible to join the two pieces of the cappuccino maker tightly enough to avoid water/coffee seeping out. I tried everything I could imagine to close the gap properly, literally using all my strength was not enough... And when I did use all my strength not only did I get a mess on the stove, but then hurt myself trying to reopen it to wash it out. Terrible! Absolutely terrible! Unless you're married to a professional athlete with sufficient strength to open and close this contraption don't bother buying it..."
2,bad gaskets leaky dirty stove,Myself and a friend both got these cute cow print cappuccino machines and never use them because they always leak and make a mess. Perhaps it is that the gaskets are bad. I have tried everything to remedy the situation and nothing works. Now have to write away for a new gasket to try and see if that helps. But new machines shouldn't cause this much trouble! Bialetti 2-Cup Mukka Express Stovetop Cappuccino Maker - Cow Print
3,Works once you get the hang of it.,It works once you get the hang of it. But sometimes you want just a plain espresso too.
4,I have a solution for coffee maker leaking,"I too have had a problem with this coffee pot leaking but my husband discovered a simple solution that should solve the problem. He noticed the seal supplied with the coffee maker between the top and bottom sections was a bit small in diameter. He went online and purchased the Bialetti replacement seal for the 9 cup coffee maker Bialetti 9-Cup Replacement Gasket/Filter Pack, Outside Diameter 3 1/4in. Part #:BI-06962 from the internet and it works...no more mess. The new seal is a 1/4in diameter bigger and provides a better seal."
5,This book is a gem!,"Ms. Coile does a wonderful job of explaining all the important elements in showing a dog. It isn't the first book I've read on the subject but it is the best. It is clear and comprehensive and provides wonderful illustrations--finally, a visual of the various patterns (down & back, the L, the triange!) and an explanation of ""pacing"" versus ""trotting."" A wealth of information at small cost! Our bouvier is on his way..."
3,good price,i thought this product was sold for a good price. it came in great condition. same as kind sold in stores. doesn't fit u740.
1,Oh dear,"I saw Mr Phillips on C-Span talking about this book. It should not be entitled ""He Talk Like A White Boy"", it should be ""He Talk Like a Dittohead"".His prescription to what ails us? Why ""America-first, UN bad, the world hates us, believe in God, moral relativism is bad, my country right or wrong"" Blah, blah, blah, Republican talking points, blah blah and some more blah.Oh, if stealing is ALWAYS bad, ALWAYS wrong - Mr Phillips quotes this to be a moral absolute, why coming from Nottinghanm in the UK was I brought up to revere Robin Hood? Why is the US a Republic and not still under the Crown? I'm sure one of Mr Phillips' moral absolutes is ""respect your leaders"".Sorry Mr Phillips, we're not buying this brand of political pap and homily today.Please note I didn't say ""Shut Up And Act""."
3,dont pull on fexi tube,"ok Amok toys look like they ran amok.plastic was dented.all 4 corners of package was dinged.bottom was bent slightly. top of plastic was all dusty.and they stuck a pricetag in the middle of the plastic,then tried to pick it off leaving 1/3 of it. plastic was all scuffed too. so i said EFF it and took her out, and putting it together kinda sucked. gun does not go into hand easy.the four smaller flexi tubes are glued to the base and i yanked one out.i assumed the bigger flexi tube popped out so the other ones did too. o well. sorry to bitch. but for 4.99 u get what u pay for.would of rather kept it in the package like all the other stuff i have.the instructions are minimal so use your imagination with the tubes."
1,"Good Idea, Bad DVD","Doing a DVD on such a group who influenced so many rappers such as Chuck D., is great idea. Unfortunately, this DVD is a bust. The sound is horrible. You can't even hear the interview over the very loud music in the background. Don't even think of wasting your money on this trash. This is coming from a very loyal and aware Last Poets fan."
2,Too Abrasive!!,This product has the potential to be great if it wasn't so abrasive.I know use Longs Drugs brand.
2,Recoton DVD476-12 S-Video Cable (12 Feet) Review,"Cable failed after about 3 months of light use. Was plugged-in and unplugged a few times a month, coiled neatly after each use and never traveled. Wouldn't purchase again."
3,WHAT? Something Sneaky Going On...,"This is a re-re-re-re-re-release of a movie that has been on the $1.00 DVD rack for the last 15 years. It was public domain as its copy write was expired for 30+ years. Any company who wanted to could release a version of this movie. I have three copies as it was part of many packaged compilation DVDs sold for under $5 for 15+ old B&W movies on one disk. They have changed the name from ""SPITFIRE"" to ""The First of the Few"" and transferred it to Blue ray. It is a great period movie with two of the best actors of the time. I have enjoyed watching it for years and it is a good family friendly movie. Don't think it is worth the whopping $44.99 price tag...Ouch!!!"
5,Hunter Fan-Palermo,This is good-looking fan! I love the remote control for operation & it's a Hunter & the quality shows. We used flush-mount & it looks very good. I like having the choice of 2 colors for the blades..we use black side & it looks sharp with the bronze finish. The price is about the best I could find anywhere plus free shipping made it a bargain.
1,I never received this item,"I assumed that I failed to order this, because I only got one item out of the two I ordered, and after reviewing past orders I realize that I paid for it, but didn't receive it. I reviewed my orders, because there is another order in the same situation. I paid for it, and never received it. Now I'm going back over all of my past orders to see just how much has not arrived."
3,Fair item,"this item is a little more flimsy than I expected it to be. It does hold your earphone cables fairly well, but sometimes they do become uncoiled. For the price, this item is not bad, but the shipping starts to make it a little expensive for what it really is. Bottom line is this, I think I would buy it again."
1,Dont Do It!!!!,"Oi! This TV sucks. When mine went out on me after only 1 1/2 years, I contacted westinghouse in an effort to resolve the issue, and sent in my TV. it took over six weeks for them to tell me that the part that went out wasn't being made any more!!! Jerks couldn't have said something sooner?!? Also, I didn't recive a refund on the busted model...BOO Westinghouse...boo."
2,...,"""Who would waste there money on this"" you'll would say. Well I did... 5 articulation points, blaster bolts that don't shoot, and doesn't even stand up. ONLY A COLLECTOR SHOULD BUY."
2,A bad movie that takes itself seriously,"Had they made this movie a bit more campy, it could have been hilarious. There are some pretty funny parts, but, it takes itself seriously and ends up being one of the slowest-moving movies I've seen. I would not recommend this to anyone, even if you like kung-fu movies, which I do."
1,Legal & Legit Version Now Available on DVD from WB,"Save your money on this garbage and getUrban Action Collection: 4 Film Favoritesfrom Warner Bros. You get a legit version of ""Black Belt Jones"" AND 3 other movies - including 2 other Jim Kelly adventures - for the price of this cheapo bootleg DVD."
4,Where's the DVD????,"Come on??? Who's dropping the ball on this one? I want a 5 disc special edition, special features, you name it. I'm very disappointed."
4,Good overview,This is a good e-book for the price. It makes up for the lack of clear documentation in the framework. Also the idea of using filters in Trace is kind of neat and clear code is presented for this.
3,A good first try,"Count Dooku, the baddest villian with the dumbest name ever in a film. But while Christopher Lee can pull it off, this toy doesn't really come close. Bearing just a passing resemblance to Lee, it is almost impossible to get the toy to balance correctly. In addition, the red lightsaber blade is not removable, as all the blades in the current line of figures. His cape does not stay on his shoulders, and his limited posability gives you very few options for positions. I hope that a newer version of this figure will improve both the likeness and the articulation."
3,coming of age candy,"This coming of age novel offers tons of connects for men. desire for a best friend's girl, a tryst with an older woman, a glorious lost summer. david payne starts slow and he is a little too proud of his prose at times. but the end does prove to be satisfying. this isn't the revelation that something like ""catcher in te rye"" proves to be and i'd take ""all the kings men"" over this for a grand southern tragedy."
2,Discouraging but comprehensive,"I am an economic Ph.D. student and I decided to get some more training in math through self-study. I started from fundamentals and this book sounded like a good idea. But surprisingly, I could read it only after I have taken some advanced courses in real analysis and algebra; graduate courses.The book covers true fundamentals, but the presentation is on quite a high and abstract level (notation and ""tons"" of theorems). When I came back to this book recently, I appreciated its coverage (quite comprehensive), and would rather treat it as a refresher only.I am glad I could discover the beauty of math from difference sources."
5,"Jango Fett, Supreme Bounty Hunter","Jango Fett is my favorite character in the Star Wars saga. This figure comes with a lot of gizzmos and gadgets. The first thing I noticed when I got this figure was the grappling hook, which I wrap around the gap between the jetpack and the figure's back. The second thing I noticed was the missile-firing jetpack; however I like him better with the regular ""missile"". The short-range blasters that the figure comes with fit perfectly in both the figure's hands and holsters. The helmet is okay, though I would prefere it if it wasn't removable because I always have the urge to just leave it off and I don't know why. Overall a great figure; worth buying"
5,AWSOME FIGURE!,This is by far the best Star Wars toy. Jango Fett is realy cool in the movie and also has a realy cool figure. He comes with a removable helmet(His face looks like the actor)he also comes with 2blasters and 2holsters(his blasters fit very well)and a grappling hook which is very cool. His jet pack can also come off. A very good figure I reccomend you by this toy.
1,Call your vet NOW!,"I'll save you ten bucks. Call your vet NOW!This book boasts detailed decision trees for all manner of equine health worries. You will find that most every branch of every tree for every malady directs you to make a frantic emergency call to a veterinarian. Don't have a veterinarian on call 24/7, and a bank account up to the task of calling him every few weeks? Then all you'll get from this book is worry and guilt.If you want to discern between what's routine, what's serious, and what's an emergency, you need a more serious veterinary reference.Useless and frustrating."
1,Disappointed,"The book did not come with a dust cover, but the picture showed it did.The picture was misleading.The book itself is OK, but if I could get the dust cover to match my other editions I would then be satisfied."
5,A must have product,"I used these years ago as a teenager to help control acne and my skin was great. Then many stores stopped carrying them and I tried similar pads from other brands for awhile, which weren't effective at all (Buf-puf was probably crowded out of the large chain stores by larger companies with higher profit margins and inferior products). Eventually I just reverted to using a wash cloth or brush to wash my face for several years and my skin developed a lot of blemishes. Since I stumbled upon these again on Amazon, my skin is getting noticeably clearer and smoother. Acne is no longer an issue for me, but I think these will also prevent or minimize keloids, which many people get as they get older.Using these pads is the best way to wash ones face and is way better than a towel or brush. For the body, the synthetic, abrasiveSalux Nylon Japanese Beauty Skin Bath Wash Cloth/Towelis a must. Using these two things will keep your skin healthy and looking good for the rest of your life."
2,M y screen is cloudy!!!,"I have owned my player for barely 2 months. It was working great until it suddenly stopped playing. Condensation built up inside the screen while I was using it inside and it stopped. After a few hours, the condensation was a little better and it started playing again, but the display options don't work properly anymore.The customer help line told me to keep it in a dry place for 1 - 2 hours and let it dry out. It's been ""drying"" for a week and the screen is still spotted and cloudy.The really cool design was the main reason I bought it and I thought a Sony was supposed to be good.Sony did make me the wonderful offer of exchanging my almost brand new player for a refurbished player of ""comparable"" quality.Still seeking satisfaction."
1,1* for Software 5* for hardware,"Hardware great. Software a nighmare. Just google for ""SonicStage"" and you will see Sony fails to get this right.What drove me to write this? Downloaded half a gig of Podcasts. No amount of helpfiles or Googling can let me work out how to use Podcasts via SonicStage. SS seems determined that it must be an album and to look it up online and being a PodCast it can not. In the end I gave up and the device has half the value now since it appears not to support Podcasts."
2,"player is good, transfering music is a pain, music management very bad","I recently purchased the sony network walkman NWE507 after checking it out at a local electronic store. The player looked amazing, with unique display and in-built FM radio. But, I was totally disappointed while transfering music using the sonicstage software management program that sony ships with the walkman. YOu need to be a software programmer to understand what is going on. It does not automatically transfer songs within a play-list. I had to do a lot of manual data entry. And just after I purchased the product, I called in for support and I was told that I need to download a later version of sonicstage off their website. It is a pain."
5,This is a great little player,I was having a lot of problems with mp3 players until a friend gave me this one used.THIS THING IS AWESOME!You can organize your music on the player from Sonic Stage which is a great program. The battery lasts a long time and takes a very short time to charge via usb 2.0 port.It is absolutely excellent
1,Software difficult to use,"The player itself is relatively nice, although considering how similar these flash players are, it's way on the expensive side.The real problem is how restrictive and difficult to use the software is. It's slow and is always nagging you to convert from one format to another. You can't move your music back and forth from the device easily. There are lots of media players out there and this is close to the worst. For that reason I would look for a player that doesn't use this Sony software."
1,E.C,"I bought one on Sep 27, and got it from UPS on Oct 5.On Oct 6, I decided to return the product. The software is hard to use, and it takes up to nearly 100MB to install it. Most of the MP3 file in my computer cannot be played by this device. I always got a ""Cannot Play"" message. The menu is not that friendly too.....BTW, on Sep 27 the price was 189.99, and now it's 159.99"
5,Great product,"I've used Energy Suspension products before and when it came to replace the sway bar bushings on my 1989 VW Cabriolet this was the brand I preferred. Just two additional things to mention. Use the supplied grease liberally, otherwise you will develop an annoying squeak after a while. Second is that the information supplied says that this will not fit an MK1 VW cabriolet (1985-1993) but it does. After pulling my sway bar out and visually comparing as well as ensuring that my sway bar was a 17mm I ordered the parts, confidant they would fit.You'll need a 13mm and 15mm socket and a pair of pliers (to gently align the bushing) to do the job and a vise to clamp the sway bar into to pop the two end bushings on. The job takes about an hour or so do for the average shade tree mechanic."
4,Buf-Puf,"I purchased this after researching what would best help/prevent my flaky, dry skin. The extra gentle Buf-Puf is great for every day cleansing. I use a dab of cleanser, wet the puff and make little circles over my skin. It is just enough exfoliation to get the dead cells off, but not so much that it irritates my sensitive skin. I follow up with my skin care regimen (serum, toner, moisturizer) and this little puff has helped make a world of difference.Being the first time that I have used one of these, I am not sure how long they ""normally"" last, but I have gotten a good two and weeks of daily use out of mine, before noticing that it was beginning to lose it's structure a bit."
1,Get another kettle!,"The lid on the spout does not fit properly. During heating, water condenses on the lid and drips out the spout! I'm left with a pool of water on my stove after boiling! Get another kettle!"
1,Many quality issues,"This teakettle has a beautiful design, but it is only good if you are planning to use it once a year.I used it every day. After 2 months the whistle stopped working, after 4 months, the enamel started chipping off, and then the handle broke.Total waste of money!"
1,Total complete waste of time,I have never left a review but this was a total watse of time and I don't want people wasting two cents on this negative diatribe that has no useful infomation. None! Amazon should be ashamed for having this as a download. Someone had real nerve! ack!
3,Not as good as I expected,"I have been using the Refresh Tears for several years now, I wanted to give this one a try to see if it will keep my eye lubricated longer. I find when I wake up, my eyes are really dry, so I tend to use the drops before sleep and when waking up. I find that the Liquidgel hardens when it drys, leaving my eye feeling crusty when I wake up. I don't use it anymore because of this."
4,Re: Lousy lightsaber,"in response to lousy lightsaber I want to ask, the part that broke of anakin's lightsaber, was it the laser part broke off of the handle? I think it is supposed to do that. I have several jedi figures, each are great, and they all have a removable laser part. i think it is suppose to be like when there not using it, and the ""turn it off""."
4,Really cool but weak ( In some points ),"First of all, this is a great toy. but there are some flaws. I mean, the force action doesn't work basically at all, and the arm's magnet is so weak that it falls off when you put the metal lightsaber in it. The upside is that it'll work great with the Count Dooku figure for re-inactments of the final battle between the two. Although everyone will enjoy this figure, and even though I bought it, I am waiting for the new sculpt Anakin with Tusken Raider rifle, and spear."
1,"Drivel.. don't buy this based on reviews, browse it in a bookstore before you buy!","I seriously recommend that any prospective purchaser just simply browse this book before deciding to buy. The poor English and extremely simplistic themes will be readily apparent. Maybe some other reviewers want you to drop your $20 on the book based simply on their good reviews, but I'm not making a cent by recommending that you browse before buying, right? I can't speak for those other reviewers who gave this book 5 stars. Nuff said.A collection of crappy poems. It sounds like it could be an interesting read, but in reality Ben Harris has the writing talent of a 4 year old. Full of typos, improper use of the English language, and cliches. This book is a disgrace because it's not even up to the standard of high school english. I don't recommend that anyone buy this trash, and Amazon shouldn't even be carrying it. Oh well."
4,Excellent but I want need a longer playing time,"A super player with great sound, a lot of storage capability.It's perfect if you are a purist about sound:I compress MP3 at 224 KBPS to ensure the best quality at a reasonable file sizes.But not everything's perfect:You now have a super player with lots of CD's that you have easily transferred to it but the batteries that you've charged for 12 hours won't last more than 3 or 4 hours.So, if you're looking for a portable player, mmm!:it weights a lot and it eates batteries quickly.It's better to use it ""plugged"".I'm thinking of buying a smaller player for daily use and keeping this one at home with the best of my CD's into it.Resuming:Short batteries life, high-weighted but excellent sound reproduction and extras like reverb, parametric EQ and good headphones.And, what a price!"
3,Good: # of MP3 it can hold. Bad: Battery Life,"I bought this MP3 player during Fall of 2000 and expected to buy the car kit along with it, so I don't have to waste battery. Well it wasn't available anywhere. So I had to use battery, good thing they gave me 8 rechargeable batteries. I love it that it will hold all my MP3 and I don't have to make CDs anymore, but I despise the way it eats away your battery. A 2 hour battery life is not very good if you traveling a very long ways. I hope that they can come out with batteries that would not drain as quickly. Overall, if you can shell out $*** then this MP3 Player is the one to get, but be warned: IT WILL EAT YOUR BATTERIES."
4,Just one thing missing,"This has everything I want with one exception. There is no adapter for the car for power. I purchased the car adapter kit and you get another pair of earphones, which you do not need, and an adapter so the player can use the tape deck in your car to play through your car speakers. You also get a carrying case which I already have from the deluxe package. You end up paying $50 for the tape adapter. Just one more piece in the original package would have made a complete system. Other than that it is really great, great sound, great display, ease of use."
5,Great toy,I thought that this toy was very fun yet it had its down falls it is very hard to stand up but very good for the arena battle especlly wit a super battle droid or a normal one
2,"The Buf-Puf Body Sponge wasn't a bad product, ...","The Buf-Puf Body Sponge wasn't a bad product, but if you have sensitive or soft skin, it may be a little too harsh for you. The Body Sponge produced almost the same amount of lather as a pouf, but you may want to consider using it on the dishes in the kitchen. If you run it through the wash a few times, it'll soften up a little. I wouldn't recommend it for daily use unless you get pretty dirty. But, it was good for removing dry and dead skin (scrubbing lightly), removing soap scum and cleaning crock pots and glass bakeware. I think it'd be better as a back sponge if it had to be used on the body."
2,"The best there is, but still not perfect!","Really excellent. I looked long & hard for the perfect bath sponge -- not too wimpy, not too harsh, got to fit between my toes... the Buf-Puf comes closest to meeting my ""ideal"". Yet it's not perfect: it's too small. 3M would be smart to come up with another version, twice the size (Buf-Puf-Plus), not thicker, just more surface area. Another idea: Buf-Puf-Plus-Pocket, with a separation between the layers to hold a bar of soap."
5,Excellent cookbook - A staple!,"I reach for this cookbook over and over again. The recipes are simple and comprehensive, ideal for a young person learning to cook. The cookbook includes all the standard items of American cooking (like meatloaf, pot roast, mashed potatoes, potatoes au gratin) plus more (coq au vin, fajitas, etc.). Some of my favorite recipes are the chocolate chip cookies (the first time I made them, they tasted like an old family recipe), scalloped potatoes (simple to do, perfect for guests), and the oven fried potato wedges (fast and easy for every day). If you must own one cookbook, this is it.The recipes don't call for strange ingredients - as long as you have a collection of all the basic spices, you're fine! Recipes are cheap to prepare because I typically have almost all of the ingredients on hand."
4,Not as good as the old pie edition I got 30 years ago.,Too many boxed and canned recipes. Not the old time cooking I was looking for my son's non-cooking girlfriend.
5,Best gift,"This was a gift for my wife. She got one like this as a wedding gift 30 yrs ago, and now it was falling apart. So she mentioned that she would love to find another one just like it. So I found it here and she was very happy!!"
2,covering the 50s,This is a fairly weak mixture of not so hard to get 50s recordings and shameful covers of great songs. If this is your only 50s record you can do a lot better for a lot less.
2,These recipes come free with briquette packs,"I didn't order this because I instantly recognized it as just a collection of the tags that come with Bradley briquettes. I've seen perhaps twenty different recipes on them, and they're fairly decent, but the font size is too small to cook from.If you want a Bradley recipe (and there are some really excellent ones) just print one out from the Bradley website. I suspect they only publish this as a convenience to their customers, but to me it's not convenient."
3,OK games,Works well with Windows Vista - okay playbility but not terribly exciting. Could use more interesting graphics and music but not bad for a beginning player.
2,Is not waterproof,"I rarely give bad reviews - but this cover does not do what it is supposed to do, i.e. keep out water. I love my Bradley smoker (have been using it for over 2 years now) and I have had nothing but great customer service response from the company whenever I contacted them. Unfortunately this cover does not keep rainwater out. I still use it since it covers the entire smoker but I also drape another cover on top of this (bought a cheap one from walmart) to keep the water out."
3,CAPITALISM AT ITS BEST,"WHILE THIS BOOKS CONTENTS ARE WELL WRITTEN I QUESTION ITS MOTIVES. THE AUTHOR MAKES IT CLEAR THAT YOU HAVE TO PURCHASE A PRODUCT THAT CAN ONLY BE FOUND FROM ONE SOURCE THROUGH THE MAIL. HE MENTIONS NO SUBSTITUTIONS OR PRICES AND NO SAMPLES, SO IF YOU CAN'T STAND THE TASTE, YO'URE STUCK. I STAY CLEAR OF THESE KIND OF CAPITALISTIC COME ONS."
4,Science doesn't lie....,What so many people dont realize exactly what their metabolism is and how it functions. This book really lays everything out on the table in a scientific fashion and explains a lot. If information about metabolism and yo-yo dieting is what you're looking for then this is the book to get.
1,This book is purely a vehicle to sell products.,"This book is nothing more than a vehicle to sell the authors soy protein drink. You cannot be on this diet without using his products. His soy protein powder is alll you consume while on this diet (along with vegetable broth). At $29.00 a can, it is not cheap. Average consumption is one can every 7-10 days. The Atkins diet is a much better vehicle for serious weight loss."
3,Mystery of the assasin.,"This was a fun toy. I liked the satelite dish, Padme on the other hand has a cool blaster and a helmet.I give it a 4 out of 10.It was hard to put on the helmet and build the satelite.The arena escape padme was basicly like this.You know with the blaster but with the piller and no satelite.You know what i mean."
3,Rarescope: Amazons and Supermen,"Rarescope: Amazons and SupermenThe film is good, but there is much to be said for the quality of the DVD, which is to say pretty poor. Because of the quality of the DVD, it pushes the rating down to 3 stars out of 5"
2,I had to slog through this.,"I didn't read the other two books in this series, so I couldn't have cared less about the other couples. This couldn't have been an easy book to write, let alone read! It's very introspective, getting inside James' head to show us what he's unable to talk about with Madeline or anyone else. I understood Madeline's motivation for marrying him - ""I'd rather be unhappy with him than unhappy without him"", but it just dragged on and on and on... Even the happy ending couldn't uplift the rest of this book, which quite honestly, was one of the most depressing romances I've ever read. I'm just grateful that I borrowed this from my local library, so all I wasted was my time."
2,Devils Web,"Very problematical. It is like 'Simply Love', which I read once and never would again, much too full of sorrow, pain, totally frustrated love. I had the feeling that ""why the hell did Mary Balogh write this book?"" The story of two people getting together is always a bit complicated, but ""Devil's Web"" and ""Simply Love"" overdo it to the max.Linda Sheean"
1,the worst of Balogh,"I like Mary Balogh books, but this really was a dissapointment, the story goes nowhere, the characters predictable.. I couldn't believe it was the same author of some many great novels."
1,I could not read this book!,Too many characters to remember and this book jumps all over the place. I stopped reading after chapter 3.
1,This couple needs therapy,"I do enjoy a relationship that needs work - truly, I do. That's why I finished this book at all. The characters spent the entire time fighting over things that if they had just sat down and had a real talk together, they would have resolved in ten minutes. But I was okay with that, because people don't always act as they should and I thought it was realistic.What wasn't realistic was the ending. I firmly believe that if you tell your husband you're pregnant and his response is basically ""Is it mine?"" then that is not the beginning of an instant reconciliation. It's the beginning of a divorce, or at least a prolonged estrangement. I was happy that they were happy in the end, but I was convinced that two weeks later they'd be back to not speaking to each other again. Not a good taste for a romance novel to leave in your mouth.Read ""One Night for Love"" or ""A Summer To Remember"" instead. This is not a good place to start with Balogh."
1,Where do I begin...,"I have a decent collection of DVD's, that are all over the board.. From Jillian to Turbo Jam to Tae Bo. I can honestly say this is the worst workout I've ever done. Luckily, I got it on Netflix instead of actually buying it. I agree with most reviewers in that Anna is hands down the worst. She has no charism and is fake. However, I don't really fault her for that because she has no experience and probably didn't know what she was getting into. Her ""workout"" was so easy. Bob's segment, was classic Bob. It was good and challenging. However, it was only 15 minutes. The last workout was terrible. The instuctor was good and seemed like he knew what he was doing but the routine sucked. It was so repetative and boring. Overall, I felt like I didn't get much of a workout. I don't think Biggest Loser is doing the franchise any favors by putting crap like this out."
1,Waste of money,This one was a useless buy for us. I agree with most of the negative reviews for this car seat..so I will not repeat. The harness tightening system doesnt work properly. While I am able to tighten the belts - I am unable to loosen them. I am planning to discard this piece of junk and buy a new seat. The thermocol/foam supports on the side are both broken while I was very carefully trying to remove the seat cover to wash it.Extremely disappointing !!
1,Hilarious Crackpot Science,"Probably a good joke present for anyone with a decent grasp of physics- be sure to write a note on the inside the cover on how reading it changed your life. It's filled with wonderful diagrams slightly reminiscent of Feynman diagrams and particle names ('sub-seven alpha') that are the fundamental units of love and consciousness. There's a smidgen of real physics too, but nothing above the high-school level.Belongs on the bookshelf next to your Fritjof Capra, cold fusion, and zero-point energy books."
1,Terrible build quality and missing parts,"(We got the blue one... but I'm going to assume the same holds true for this one)I hate returning things and rarely do unless there's no other option... but this thing was packed up and ready to go back ten minutes after my son opened it up.A: The edges of each fret aren't flush with the neck and are (I kid you not) sharp enough to actually cut your hand, andB: Four of the eight pickups were missing. As in just four empty holes. Really weird.So, the only thing I can imagine is that this bass was a returned/refurb model that got cannibalized for parts, but of course that's neither here nor there. Back it goes and I won't be trying another from the same company again."
2,Buf-Puf Back Scrub Body Sponge,"The Buf-Puf sponge products are terrific, however the ""reusable"" handle on this product is flimsy and too short. Clients with arthritis and/or shoulder mobility compromise are unable to use the product effectively."
1,Not as advertised,I did not receive what was pictured on the website. Instead I received a bottle of nail polish remover.
4,Cute Cat,"This cat was purchased to prevent my kids from fighting over the one we had. It served it's purpose. It was more than I wanted to pay for a stuffed animal, but we live in a smaller community where it is hard to find stuff like this."
2,Pesto OCR 4 cannot perform OCR on PDF files,"The main purpose for my purchase was to perform OCR on PDF files. The documentation was not clear on this matter and did refer to PDF capabilities. However, the software can create PDF files but cannot convert PDF files to MS Word format. So the product was of no use to me."
1,Can't get started,"I've played similar games and can see that this one has some merit, but the manual is pathetic and fails to describe any of the initial steps necessary to start a game. My guess is that you have to blunder through numerous starts before you stumble on successful moves, something I am too old to enjoy. This one goes on the shelf until I find some literature explaining what should have been included in the manual."
1,Another boring warcraft-alike,"If you love RTS' click-fest games then you'll like this too. If you are looking for historically accurate games that contain real strategy and tactics AVOID AVOID AVOID this game.Just like warcraft, make buildings, gather resources, build guys and throw them at the enemy with very little strategy.Worse yet, no tutorial and no player aide of building-unit progressions means you play many games simply to learn with no possibility of winning."
1,Beware of seller,"My grandson purchased this item and was very excited. It arrived broken, and in trying to deal with the seller, we found that it would cost more to return it than what he originally paid for it. Seller was not easy to deal with and finally I just gave up. We were able to repair the break so that it could be played with, but that is something that should not be necessary with a brand new toy."
5,"Mechanic or not, a must have","If you own the car, you should own this manual. For those of you who own these cars, and need service, you will be much better prepared for dealing with a mechanic. Fluids specs, full description of features, and service recommendations are included. For those of you who will work on their own car, you will find the ""german method"" the only method for completing the work. An absolute godsend when installing stereos, etc, as the each of the approximately 2 billion VW/AUDI clip styles are covered (okay, I exaggerated)These manuals are derived from the manuals supplied to the dealers. Worth every cent."
2,The HEAD comes off!!,I bought this for my 5yo that loves Star Wars just like his dad did years ago. I was stunned when we opened it up and the head fell off!! It was magnetic and stuck back on. I just couldn't believe they would sell a toy so gross. There was no mention of it on the package or anything! Do not buy this toy for a young child!!
3,Another Dathr Maul....c'mon Hasbro,"Ultraprime99 here,Okay what is wrong with the Hasbro company why do we need another stupid darth maul figure...ooooo...I know...So we can put magnets in his hands and give him a little metal lightsaber that should fly to his hand when you wave the figures hand over the metal rod and, and we could make a new color scheme on him and, and make him bow to his master or make him bow to his master's....ooops sorry got carried away.I'm waiting for the exclusive ""NEB TTRUB"" figure with SOUND MIXING AND POST-PRODUCTION table...yeah!what can I say Hasbro you morons get it together!and remember...Peace and good toy hunting!Keep the toy dealer down!Kids... big and small... Don't ever buy from the on-line toy dealer scum except for Amazon: better prices and cheaper shipping cost!Ultraprime99 transform and merge out!"
4,This product is definitely the best treatment I've ...,"This product is definitely the best treatment I've ever tried for irritated skin. I used it every other day, according to the directions, and after only a week I could feel the improvement in my skin (of course, I put on a rich lotion, also Aveeno, after the soak). I also like the natural oatmeal smell of this product, which is really soothing. The only problem was that this product was kind of hard to dissolve and I had to stir the water thoroughly to avoid clumping."
2,I was excited to try this product because ...,"I was excited to try this product because I buy Aveeno oatmeal lotion by the gallon! Both of my children have very dry, sensitive skin (and eczema) and it was difficult to find a lotion that would soothe their skin without irritating fragrances. Our pediatrician said to stop using soap during the winter months because it's so drying. I was very disappointed in Aveeno Bath Treatment. As far as I can tell, it didn't help at ALL! And it made a gooey mess in the bottom of the bathtub. I'll save the remaining two packets from this box in case my children get chickenpox or poison ivy (the box says it helps that, too), but I must sadly say that it did NOT help with eczema!"
5,Magnifique,A delightful book which has been thoughtfuly written and beautifuly illustrated. My knowledge of applique has been significantly increased - my practical skills will surely follow.
5,"applique, quilting","If you want to take embellishment over the top, this is for you. Excellent source of inspiration for applique that is so special. Highly recommend."
3,condition of CD,"The CD itself was in good shape. The condition of the case raised my concern. Upon receipt, the case was broken, broken beyond repair. If this is the usual way the supplier ships their product, I will not make any future purchases. I hope this was a isolated incident."
2,Did nothing to my breakouts,"I have combination skin and have been using this daily for the past 2 weeks. However, there hasn't been any noticeable difference on my skin. I still break out, and my dark spots don't seem to be going anywhere soon. It moisturizes okay (nothing special), but in terms of treating pimples, this dual-action product leaves its promise unfulfilled."
4,THE COMPLETE ILLUSTRATED GUIDE TO CAT CARE & BEHAVIOR,"I thought this book was very informative, and well illustrated. I think that anyone that is thinking about getting a cat or even anyone that has one already will find this helpful. I needed information about kittens, and found this book the best information on the subject, but it doesn't stop there."
5,Great Find.,"I was surfing through Amazon and ordered this book, almost by accident. I read it in 2 sittings. Intense and fun, a quick read and a must for fans of action-packed susupense novels."
3,Kabbalah life movie,"Good book, but not of the caliber of the others I have read on the topic. Maybe a little too advanced for me at this time."
1,don't stick,"I have 6 of these pieces of worthless plastic...none of them stick! Surfaces were cleaned first and they still don't stick. The adhesive pad pulled off the latch and is stuck to my door on the one latch...so I guess that one did, technically, stick. I have visited other websites and more people than not are saying these things are horrible. Buyer beware!"
1,Not the right price,"Not the right price for this product. I checked the same item with 2 count, in local store for 5$. Beware."
1,Not impressed,We spent $6.00 on this which is cheap but then another $9.00 on shipping and tax. That was the first thing that was annoying seeing as it weighs next to nothing. When we got it we didn't realize you HAVE to have the type of refrigerator that opens on the side. Not in the middle with two doors. We realized as soon as we opened it we couldn't use it and it wouldn't fit. Nothing in the reviews said anything about this. BEWARE if you have a double refrigerator which most people do.
2,Didn't work for us.,"I purchased this to put on my bottom drawer freezer. Installation was really easy and it did stick great to the surface. However, my 18 month old figured out how to open it without even watching me use it. Duh...it has a button, which is fascinating to most toddlers."
2,Ineffective against children,"We purchased these to keep our two year old out of our fridge and freezer. Proud of our effort, within five minutes our two-year old came downstairs with a gallon of milk... I go up to see the fridge open. He then demonstrated again how he pushed up a chair, reached up, pushed the button, and pulled the cable out. Zero protection.However, I did give an extra star for one use. I was able to use it at work to tightly close a fridge that had a broken gasket... So, it wasn't completely worthless."
2,"Dissapointed, but this is as good as I've found","I bought 6 of these for my filing cabinet, oven drawer (under the mainoven door), dishwasher and computer door. After 3 months,2 of them arebroken from being shut inside the door repeatedly by the kids or a carelessadult. They snap at the same place, the thinnest plastic part of the latch.I think this should be stronger, but you could say this is my fault. It ISjust plastic after all and we're dealing with kids here. I just wish thispart of the latch was stronger. 2 of the locks, after being properly installedjust popped off out of no where. I pushed them back into place and they seemto be adhered as good as before. Neither of the latches that popped off arepulled very often by the kids. So it seems that they work better with more""use"". I can't give these a full bad review because they work. But they needto be improved. I also have not found anything better."
1,All but useless,"I bought a 2 pack of these locks for a freezer door that has been know to open up just a crack. This has led to some items defrosting prematurely. Figured it be better to spend a few bucks than to keep throwing away food. The first one lasted 1 1/2 months before the adhesive failed, the second one lasted maybe two months before the plastic clip broke. Don't waste your money."
3,It seemed to work really well. But did ...,It seemed to work really well. But did dry out my skin. The instructions suggest using it a lot less frequently at first and I would highly recommend that also (especially if you have sensitive skin).
5,The Jedburghs,"[[ASIN:1586484621 The Jedburghs: The Secret History of the Allied Special Forces, France 1944]The Jedburghs is a well written and informative history of a little known Allied special operations force in World War II. Their mission was the direct per-cursor to the U.S.Army Special Forces (The Green Berets); to organize, arm, train, and lead in battle, a guerilla force behind enemy lines.A good read."
2,Poor reception,"This GPS receiver was packaged and rebranded with a Microsoft logo with Streets and Trips, and is almost worthless. You can count on this receiver not receiving anything if you have any amount of trees, buildings, or less-than-perfect weather conditions. In a vehicle in the most perfect conditions it only manages about four satellites, and that's with a clear sky and no surroundings. Please try to stay away from this GPS receiver."
3,you get what you pay for.,"cute little game, but after playing for about 30 minutes it starts to get real boring. for the price not a bad option to download and just have for those days when you need a break from rise of nations, simcity or what ever games you typically play."
5,Outstanding,I play for hours on end in free play. Then when I found the LA MOD I spent even more time playing it. One hell of a game. Hoorah
1,Do not even pay for this,I have wanted this game for awhile for the modding potential but to my dismay amazon screwed up and it is missing somepthing to allow the mod installer to work so if you want to save yourself hours of headache get the disc version
2,Not sure why they call it Clean & ...,"Not sure why they call it Clean & Clear Persa-Gel when this product is so much more like a paste than a gel. It also leaves behind a visible white residue unless it's applied EXTREMELY sparingly (which doesn't leave you feeling especially clean or attractive). If oily skin is a problem for you, the 10% peroxide solution in this cream will definitely dry it up -- my skin (which is normal) felt too tight and dry after using this product, though. I would NOT buy this product in the future."
2,didn't work for my kids,"so far, 3 kids (18, 16 and 13) have had no results with this. The boys may be a little challenged on washing with it twice a day and have more severe acne than the 13yo but I'm very disappointed that it has not helped them at all."
2,Won't Use Again,"This stuff is very drying!! My face went from oily to super dry and flaking after using this! To make matters worse, it did NOT clear up my acne any faster, so I won't be using this again."
4,This really improved my skin,"This stuff works well on my blemishes. It took a little while to work on the big ones but it really dries up the pimples. This makes your skin dry (and I have oily skin), so get a good moisturizer.It's a good product: cheap, easy and works."
1,caused bumps on my daughter's face,"I do not recommend this product. My 11 year old daughter had a little bit on acne on her nose and forehead. After one use, small bumps similar to a heat rash was all over her face."
4,A good read on a little-discussed theater of operations,"This book does a good job of putting you in the place of the soldiers who served with the Burma Bridge Busters. This book is written in a similar style to ""Flags of Our Fathers"", switching between life at home before the war, during training, and in-theatre. I really appreciate this because my father served with this unit during WW2, but died before I was old enough to discuss it with him. This book helps me feel like I have at least a little more understanding of his experience. My thanks to the author for doing such a good job and helping bring to light a much overlooked theater of operations."
4,Bicycling books,"If you are interested at all in the history of bicycling, you will enjoy this book. It is well written, not really surprising considering its source. It would make a good gift for anyone you know who rides a bicycle."
4,Excellent sound and production.,"Excellent sound and production.Scotto's voice has declined (her upper range sounds bad), but she is gorgeous on ACT III where feeling and expression are very important.Kraus's voice also sounds old, but his whole performance is good.The best ""Parigi o cara"" i have heard."
2,This product did virtually nothing for my skin. ...,"This product did virtually nothing for my skin. I broke out more this week than I have in a long time. Perhaps it's because my skin is already semi-dry, but the Neutrogena On-The-Spot caused my skin to flake and peel and irritated my pimples. I have used many other products in the past with much better results. So if you have dry skin, stay away from this product."
2,not very useful,I've been using this product for awhile now since I got them but I haven't noticed any significant change on my skin. It didn't make my breakouts worse but it didn't make it better either.
5,Not too drying,"I was using another brand but they bumped up their benzoyl peroxide to 10% and that is too drying for my skin and then creates a worse breakout for my skin. This product is only 2.5% which is similar to the product I was using before. I would recommend this to anyone who has been trying something with 10% and it's either too drying or creating worse breakouts, sometimes using less % can be beneficial."
1,Waste of Money,The level of detail is wrong from start to finish. It's too detailed to give you a good introduction to replication architecture. It's too general to be useful for hands-on work. There's a market out there for a real replication primer; too bad this isn't it.
2,Nice try! Too bad it flopped!,"I'll give an extra star to the ghostwriter for trying, but c'mon! These books are terrible! The Andrews family should have stopped these books once V.C. died instead of churning out these poorly-written, sappy, unrealistic novels. It's worse than watching an episode of Days, for crying out loud! Either get a new writer or stop this all together!"
1,One of the most boring books I've read,"Unlike most of the other books that V.C. Andrews' ghost writer has penned, I really had trouble getting through this one. It is unlike anything Viriginia would have written."
2,Not such a great book.,I've been reading V.C. Andrews for years and this book was such a big dissappointment. For one thing the author of this book didnt try to really develop his main character. He could have written 2 books out of Celeste if he had just told the story the way VC Andrews would have. I was so excited when I saw this book and was so upset when I finished it. I dont even want to read the next book if its anything like this one was.
1,Make it stop!,"This book is TERRIBLE. It is perhaps the slowest-paced book I have ever read. We know from the back cover that Noble is going to die & Celeste is going to be made his surrogate. This has the potential for great stories, intriguing psychological drama, and other things one might look for in a book like this. But not when it takes half the author hundreds of pages just to get to what should be the starting point. The reader is forced to sit through page after page of the family eating dinner, or playing in the yard, or other pointless minutiae that serve to develop neither the plot nor the characters. Not to mention that it's written in a simplistic style that might be considered artistic when the narrator is 7, but is merely degrading by the time she reaches adulthood.Do yourself a favor and watch paint dry. It would go faster and be more worthwhile than this book."
1,big mistake,"I was seduced by the cool appearance of this product. I knew about the need to go through the Sony regulatory software to get content on the device, but I figured ""no big deal."" As it turns out, it is a big deal - a big pain in the neck that is. The software is slow and clumsy, and it takes a lot of time to change the content on the player. I would avoid this player and get something that allows more freedom in moving content on and off the device."
4,looks just like him!!!,"this figure is pretty cool. it looks just like Ian. but i havent opened him because he is very rare, so i want him in mint condition. plus, he woulnt really be any fun if you open him. unlike Kyle i keep the very rare figures in the case."
4,The Emperor He Will Become.,"This toy is really durable, but not very flexible as it is basically only posable at the arms. However, the pose that Supreme Chancellor Palpatine is in is perfect, embodying the regal splendor of the great Republican leader he is supposed to be, yet at the same time hinting at the evil that lies within as the future Emperor. The toy is fun to play with, but also works well as a display piece."
4,Good but not entirely clear,"A very good introduction but spends too much time preaching in the sidebars and on ""touchy-feely"" stuff. Content is reasonable but it covers much more than just einstein. More like a brief history of physics. Doesn't explain some issues very well at all, others does a fine job. Recommended."
3,Mixed Impression,"Positive: A fairly easy read, well written.Good biographical material dealing with Einstein's work, social, and political views.Non-mathematical accounts of general & special theory of relativity, and quantum theory.Negative: discursive, somewhat superficial accounts of the history of physics.The thread of the author's arguments are frequently lost through his excursions into philosophy, religion, and the psychology of the unconscious. Some of this is pretty superficial and the comnnecttions made between these fields and contemporary physics is, in my opinion, a real stretch.The discussion of time and relativity is at times confusing because the distinction between the observer and the event is not made clear."
3,It took long time and deliverd wrong color,"Though it's beautiful, deliverd wrong item. But I recomend it."
2,It smoothes my skin. I can feel the ...,It smoothes my skin. I can feel the difference. But I don't like the smell.
4,"Living in Texas with plenty of sun year-round, ...","Living in Texas with plenty of sun year-round, my skin has become really dry and sensitive. Most soaps make my skin itchy. I have been using the Cetaphil Antibacterial Cleansing Bar for almost a week now, and I found it to be really good. The bar is just as they say -- very gentle on your skin. I have had no problems since using it, and my skin has even become a little softer. The fragrance is very light. I also found that it didn't leave a residue on my skin after being rinsed off, just a nice clean feeling. The only downside to this cleansing bar was that it didn't lather up as much as I would have liked."
5,The Cetaphil Antibacterial Gentle Cleansing Bar is something ...,"The Cetaphil Antibacterial Gentle Cleansing Bar is something I would definitely purchase for personal use. It lives up to its name of being gentle. There were several noticeable differences between this and my normal bar soap, including the fact that it didn't dry my skin out at all. Also, the bar itself seemed more solid and did not dissolve quickly, making for longer lasting use. It's a great soap to use for hand washing as well as body washing. I highly recommend this cleansing bar."
4,It was nice to use an antibacterial soap ...,"It was nice to use an antibacterial soap that was gentle on skin. I have very sensitive, dry skin. I didn't like the fact that it contained a fragrance. I prefer to use fragrance-free soap. But overall, I would give this soap a thumbs up for people who want a refreshing scent along with soap that's gentle on skin."
5,"Great camera, excellant purchase experience","Camera received in condition exactly as described, or really a little better. Suggested it was used but I was a little hard pressed to see how. Arrived earlier than expected, overall a wonderful experience. If all were like this, walk-in store fronts might just as well shutter up."
1,Can't find speaker wires behind drywall,"My home was prewired for in-wall speakers. I had a rough drawing from the contractor on where the speaker wires were located in ceiling. I found one wire end in the attic, and bought this tone generator/pulse thinking I could find where the wires terminated before cutting holes in the dry wall. Fat chance. The only time I could get a tone is was near the exposed wire in the attic. As soon as I tried to use the probe through the drywall, got nothing but static, even just 6-inches from where the wires dropped out of the attic. Spend the money to get a tool that works. This one doesn't."
2,I wish this worked...,"Big promises, no results. This did NOTHING to hold on to my color, which was gone within a week.Don't waste your money."
5,Fantastic Video,"I totally agree with the previous review, this is a great video on the Bee Gees. I especially enjoyed the segments on how they compose their music. They all have such great personalities and they really come through on this video. I loved it so much I'm buying another copy for a friend of mine who is also a Bee Gee fan. But fan or no fan this is a must have for anyone who enjoys their music. You will have a new found respect for these three guys. I also have a copy of The Bee Gees Going Home which I recorded off the Disney channel back in 1979-1980. My copy is totally worn out now, but if anyone knows where I can get my hands o a copy please let me know. This was another great documentary on the Gibb Brothers lives."
3,Ehh....,"We have seasons 1-5 which are in black/white, and this one is now in color. Barney Fife is no longer on as a regular, and Andy's character is a little more ""angrier"" and not quite as gentle as he had been in prior seasons. It's still an ok show, but we have basically abandoned watching this Season 6 and have simply gone back to watching the previous seasons and enjoy them much more. I don't expect to be purchasing any more seasons because of this. Just reaffirms to me that the simpllcity of black-and-white TV and Mayberry are a perfect match."
3,No Fife? No dice.,"And it really is all that simple. Some things in life aren't, but the absence of one Bernard P. Fife (and as important) the appearance of ""Warren"" simply creates a different aura for this show I cannot digest. Some may point out that Barn wasn't in every episode in seasons 1-5 however even when he wasn't his ""letters home"" were even often the highlight. I'm not sure when the likes of Ken Berry and company show up as I'm not as literate in the carnate of this show after Don Knotts, but none of them are properly cast and the show was clearly riding on the chemistry created by Andy and Barney. Now, I'm not saying the show became unwatchable, and there are worse shows but I'd rather actually watch a so-so show that stayed so-so, than a great show turned average."
1,Wrong item.,New Customer.I ordered Memory Stick MSA128H 128MB an they sent to me MSA128A they insisted that it would work in my camaara. I put it in and it will not format. I sent it back to them and Inever heard from them again. I know the product is out there so I will have to try elswhere. I allready sent this to you before. I didn't get any satisfaction from this company.
4,Fun starter camera,Although all the gadgets were a little overwhelming at first their instruction manual is very helpful and helped me not only with the camera but a little general photography. It would have been nice to get some batteries with it but if that's the only gripe I've got I'm pretty impressed.
1,Imitation of Life by John M. Stahl,This is Lana Turner and full cast best film I have ever seen. This was my Father's most favorite film and am I desperately wanting it. Please help me find it. Thanks
2,Imitation of Life,"Great movie! However, I was disappointed in the way the DVD was marketed. I expected the DVD to actually include both films--one with Claudette Colbert (1934) and one with Lena Turner (1959). The DVD is only of the 1959 film. That is the reason for the low rating."
5,"The Best, better than the 1959 Remake!!","I saw this movie on TV many times as a child, and everytime I saw it I would cry at the end. I have read other reviews about how the movie is dated and ""politically incorrect"", c'mon people this movie was made decades ago, and for it's time, it was and is dynamite, I will always remember the scene at the end where, the maid has literally died of a broken heart,'cause her daughter has rejected her. There is a funeral procession led by beautiful white horses, and Mahalia Jackson is singing at the Funeral , and the Maid's daughter running behind the funeral procession, screaming ""Mama, I'm sorry!"". This movie is my absolute all time favorite."
3,Remake is better,"As a black person, I obviously see what was lacking in these type of films. Of course I was more taken with the portrayal of Beavers emotions. First of all, if this daughter of hers was only 'passing' then why is it that when at home, her daughter still didn't like her? Also there was a scene where the portrayal of her was not too nice. I noticed much more than the average person as I personalized what was going on, similar to any film somwone would identify with if they saw scenes that reminded them of a situation.In the remake at least there was more emotion at the end. The daughter who was passing felt guilt- ridden but I dont' know where it came from since we never see mother and daughter interact. That was a tear jerker looking at the mother being treated like dirt. In the remake there were scenes that were more interesting. As for the first one...empty. But I do rem in was made in the thirties!!"
3,still have acne,"i still breakout after continued use. Blackheads still there. It's very gentle on skin though and won't burn your eyes. With good oil control but won't last the whole day. I still prefer the vitamin soap, it has more control on blackheads."
3,Heavy Duty and just heavy,OK I'm a pretty strong guy but when you fill up the tank it has a weight of over 45 lbs and then you have to flip it quickly and stand it upright on the dispenser. If you don't do it quick enough it goes all over the place. A plus is even with our 3 pets it takes them awhile to drink this much water so the fill-ups are not that frequent. I probably would rather go with a 3 gallon tank and fill it a little more often rather than wrestle with this beast.
3,Obnoxious,"This book would be great if you didn't absolutely despise every single character.This book would be funny if it wasn't trying so hard.This story would be entertaining if someone wasn't always coming in with the long winded explanations.In fact, if it wasn't such a quick read, it might've found itself flying down the elevator shaft with a good riddance tossed in after it. Rather, if you find this book used for 50c, give it a go. It has some good one liners and is mildly amusing when it isn't being intensely irritating. It sure isn't worth the $10 I shelled out for it."
5,excellently written book,This is the story of a 12 year old girl who has to leave her parents and escape from the German occupation of Prague on foot and alone. This story is truly gripping and so well written that it is hard to put down
5,Probably the best season!,"On a personal note, and agreeing with the other reviewers this is the one I've been waiting for, Magnum Pi's seventh season is I would say the best.Most magnum pi fans would agree that seasons one, two and three were great, the show lost its way a little with seasons four, five and six, but then picked up again brilliantly with seasons seven and eight.Season seven has no doubt the most memorable episodes of the entire series, ask any fan and just to name a few they would immediatly shout out episodes such as 'death and taxes', 'paper war', 'little girl who' and the outstanding season finale 'Limbo'.Any person who is on the fence with this one should just purchase as its fantastic entertainment!"
2,Magnum DVD Season 7,"I was very disappointed and had to return the item, because the DVDs werde damaged and did not run. I would have liked this particular season 7 of the Magnum Series because it had the crossover from Murder She Wrote."
1,TOO SMALL FOR PALM PRE,"This product was advertised as sized for the Palm Pre, but it is too small. I do not recommend."
1,An UN-scientific approach,"I was intrigued by the claims of the author of this book that it wasanchored in the scientific method. But not only did I find out thatthe scientific method he claims to use isn't scientific at all, hefalls into the trap that so many other authors on Atlantis fall into-ignoring what Plato so clearly and explicitly SAID and insteadmanipulating the text, and claiming to know what Plato actually MEANT.For example, Plato SAID Atlantis was in front of the Pillars ofHeracles (now called the Straits of Gibraltar). That's pretty clear.But since Ireland isn't located there, the author claims that PlatoMEANT that Atlantis was ""somewhere in the Atlantic."" Voila-now Irelandfits perfectly! The rest of the book pretty much follows thesame ""method""-interesting fiction, but nowhere near scientific!"
4,Not for the Faint of Heart,"Months after reading Triomf I can still close my eyes and like Dorothy clicking her heels, am quickly transported to heat, poverty, opressive depression and the sense of something really grimy nagging at the corners of my soul.When someone chooses a book in order to visit another place I don't imagine this is the ""where"" many are after. The author - and translator - have managed a perfect journey, not very pretty, into the world of a South African version of poor white trash. The characters' lives are like the town they live in - built on destruction with God know what lying rotting under the surface. As I read I was almost desperate to find something, anything, to like about the characters. The few moments when that happened were rain in the desert. Sweet, relieving, and over very quickly.This book is a slice of life written well enough to make it quite real. The question here is if you want to go where Marlene van Niekerk takes you."
1,Alex Thomas,The DVD wasn't what I expected! Wasn't funny and took short... I will never purchased a Alex Thomas DVD again...
5,This Is Good Action,"I saw this movie a long time ago, probably around 1997, but I thought it was highly entertaining with amazing acrobatic kung fu. The fighting among the women in this movie was awesome particularly that of Joyce Mina Godenzi, wife of Sammo Hung. Yuen Biao in this movie was particularly interesting and fun to watch as he imagines himself to be a legendary Chinese swordsman. I saw this movie after I saw Jet Li's ""Swordsman II"" and I still liked this movie.... Anyway, see this film whenever you get the chance, I think you'll enjoy seeing it."
1,Windows XP,"If you have xp or are plannig on upgrading to xp, don't buy this player. I purchased it when it first came out(149.95 + tax)and have upgraded to xp. It will not work with xp and rca does not plan on fixing the problem. Just a word of warning.Thanks Patrick"
2,No Memory?!?!,"I bought this little guy and was really excited. I installed all the software on my Windows 2000. When i tried to put my songs on the player, it said i had no memory!?! I even put in 64 MB extra! Its very annoying. I wouldnt reccomend this product."
5,GET THIS ONE - PRICE AND QUALITY,"I wanted an MP3 Player for running and I didn't want to spend a lot of money. Also, I know the ones with the built-in FM will get cheaper as time goes by, so after reading many user ratings and since there was a [$$$] rebate, ... I decided to get this one. It is sooooo awesome! The sound and size of this player are great! It blew me away from what I was expecting at this price. The thing with Windows XP - The MusicMatch software (ver 7.1) from the CD it came with did not work. Instead ... download the newer version 7.5 for free. Also, it is a 32mb, but you can buy a card and pop in more memory. I am very happy with this player and highly highly recommend getting it, it is definitely more bang for your buck! ..."
3,Not Sure How To Tell If This Is Working...,"I've had no adverse reactions to this product, but I also cannot tell if it's working. I take it every day mixed in water. There is an aftertaste if I use too much, or don't wait for it to mix/dilute into my water, but it's not awful or overbearing otherwise."
1,Not nearly as good as I expected,"For the price of this camera I was very disappointed. Lens cover is a bit flimsy, pitcure quality is lousy even at highest resolution. LCD display is slow to respond. Menu display could be more intuitive, flash over-compensates and washes out pictures entirely. Do your self a favor and spend a few more dollars and get a better digital camera. This one is a dissapointment. Ended up with a Sony Mavica which is more money but is a far better camera."
4,nice pics for the price but...,"i honestly wish it had a real zoom. the zoom it comes with has 3 levels and all digital. you get a bit more flex with a manual zoom. otherwise, no complaints"
4,Awesome camera with a great price tag!,For the inexperienced user this camera is a great first step into the world of digital cameras. I bought this thinking I would get started with digital then sell it to upgrade but I'm keeping this one. I purchased the rechargable batteries but I'm still waiting on the original batteries to die out. This camera takes wonderful pictures and I've even blown a few of them up to poster size.
4,Great for beginners,"After a lot of comparing I decided to purchase the D-380. I must say that I am very happy with it. Although the zoom is not all that great, and some of the pictures come out blurry, it is a great buy. I have a habit of loosing things so I needed a camera that was cheap but nice. Also the software that comes with the camera is kind of iffy but the free ofoto software works great. I recommend this camera to someone who is buying their first digital camera or just need a camera for occasional use. I am in college and it is perfect for me. But i am definetly going to upgrade when i purchase my next camera. Great Graduation Gift."
1,THE HOUSE THAT MGA BUILT,"This is another piece of junk put out by MGA. The so called ""furniture"" is the worse part. It is the cheapest thing I have ever purchased for my girls (and I have three)! The furniture doesn't fit back in the house so you have to keep trying to put it back together and it falls apart when a doll trys to sit on it (except for the bed). I agree that the only nice thing is the fabric and pillows. Save your money, don't but this piece of cardboard."
5,"The BEST guidebook for feeding, projects and gardening ideas","This is the best bird feeding book I have found. Great for new home owners, great for the family. This is the only book you need to begin or learn new tips on feeding. I was thrilled with the gardening tips, and the creative projects. From making feeders, making seed mixes on a budget, and using leftovers, Sally Roth covers all aspects of feeding and what you can attract to your yard. What sold me on this book, and the reason why I am buying five more for my friends, is how the author integrates gardening with birding. With gardening and bird watching being the number one and number two hobbies in America, it is easy to understand why this booked is loved and appreciated."
4,A must have for a Marketeer,"I spotted this book at my college Library and promptly went and grabbed it from the bookstore. The book talks about how simple things like the bobby pin, chopsticks were invented.Goes to show that innovation exists all around us.A definite must have for a marketeer, or a business person dealing with consumers."
2,Very Humble Indeed,"This book didn't stay on our coffee table for long. Some of the photographs are amazing, but the layout and paper quality of the book do not contribute well at all. This was a gift for my husband when he was just beginning his journey in photography, but I was disappointed at the lack of masterpieces I found."
4,"MARRIAGE IS A COVENANT, NOT A CONTRACT","THIS BOOK IS A MUST FOR THOSE DOING PRE/MARRIAGE COUNSELING! I AM USING THIS BOOK AS A REQUIREMENT FOR MARRIAGE, AND AS A POINT OF REFERENCE TO MARRIED COUPLES WHO ARE HAVING DIFFICULTIES IN THEIR RELATIONSHIP. THE TITLE OF THE BOOK SAYS IT ALL, ""MARRIAGE IS A COVENANT""! IT IS SCRIPTURAL BASED WITH PRACTICAL INSIGHTS THAT SHARE THE TRUTH OF HOW A MARRIAGE CAN SURVIVE THE STORMS OF LIFE. THE SECTION QUESTIONS ARE WELL WRITTEN AND CAUSES THE READER TO DRAW ON WHAT HE/SHE READ."
4,Ginsberg meets a new subject worthy of his poetry,"Ginsberg wrote his greatest works in the fifties although moments of his power were felt later, for example the work 'White Shroud.' He did not find a subject worthy of his powers. The poet/prophet sometimes did seem to waste his insights on matters of transitory importance. Unfortunately, it was his own inpending death that did provide a powerful subject for his pen. Not every poem in this volume is up to the standards he had reached in previous work,but many can be counted among his best poems."
2,Awful,"I was hoping this would be a good book with all the good reviews. It started out okay bit then went downhill. I cannot even tell you how many times I rolled my eyes while reading this book. Very cheesey romance parts, unbelievable police situations. The only reason I'm giving this book 2 stars is because of the price and because it helped me kill a few hours."
4,harumph!,"this is a fine camera, but i have to admit that when i finished taking my photos and got them developed, i was dissapointed to see that they all came back upside down! I am happy with this camera but would like to see a model in the future perhaps that takes photos right side up. It's annoying."
5,All the grooves,"This girl does have a really good upbeat and tone to all of her music. We belong together is such a great song. And I hope everybody thinks that to. she is very very pretty. and seems to have a great Talent. She has a great oppurtunity to be even better then she is right now. All of her videos are awesome, and all the diffent types of mixtures they have for the songs are better than any other. Mariah Carey seems to write her own songs. And to me her music is herself. her number one hit on her other cd was Shake it off. And We Belong Together. Great tones and she has a voice of a rapper. But not so much. Please enjoy this review and you won't be dissapointed with any of her cds."
5,More then a comeback for Mariah,"This is a simple song with a catchy beat with all the ingredients that make up a typical M Carey hit such as ""My All"" and ""Always Be My Baby"". After a couple of rough years and weak recordings, Mariah has once again found her comfort zone at the top of the charts. ""We Belong Together"" remarkably sustained a #1 position on Billboard for nearly 4 months, seventh to the longest running #1 hit in music history. To Mariah's faithful fans, this comes to no surprise.Love her or hate her, she has proven herself over and over again for nearly 16 years, as one of pop music's greatest vocalists of all time."
4,Logical and easily assimilable apologetic.,"A contemporary opuscule on a venerable topic. If anyone still considers 'chance' as a cause after perusing this book, he should be disqualified from any cosmological debates. Exhaustive without being tiring. A recommended read for casual apologetics students."
4,A must read for christians.,"This book does not deal with the typical young earth v. old earth arguments taking place in the christian community so people with both views will likely benefit from this book. One thing to consider, Sproul is not a scientist nor does he claim to be, he's a theologian/philosopher so he uses logical arguments to prove why chance had nothing to do with the origins of the universe. People looking for scientic evidence for intelligent design will be disapointed, but anyone who does not have a background in science or philosophy and is looking to expand their knowledge should find this book very enjoyable."
5,Must Buy,This c.d. is a must buy if you enjoy contemporary praise and worship music. It's a c.d. that you won't have to skip over tracks you will listen to the entire c.d.
4,Great gospel,"This is really good! At first, I bought it for one song but it really grew on me! I love it!"
3,I wouldn't count on it to cure your skin,"I'm 13, and I have mild acne. After using this wash, your skin turns shiny especially in the T-zone. Before I used this, I didn't have much acne scars (they kinda look like small moles) however, after using it, I got a lot on my forehead and sides of my face. Something I would recommend is that after washing your face with it, once a dermatoligist says its right for you,is that when your skin feels all tight, it's like botox. Try not to show emotion for about an hour, because i found that minimized my pores alittle. That's the only positive reaction this cleanser had to my skin."
2,This product had a very pleasant fragrance and ...,This product had a very pleasant fragrance and was easy to use. I used it twice daily for five consecutive days. I found that it left my face feeling more oily than other acne face soap products that I've used. This product might be more appropriate for someone with less severe acne and only mildly oily skin.
4,BIBI's only hit,"Bibi is a gorgeous girl. That's her best attribute. She won't be remembered like one of the best singers, but this pop record was good for the 90's.If you haven't heard it, please don't expect a great vocalist, but fine pop music. The most remarkable titles of this cd are ""Y se marcha perdiendo perdon"", ""Deseria"", ""No me importa"" and ""Mucha mujer para ti"""
5,"Excellent for first time learners, even adults","Bonjour les amis! is an excellent tool to start you kids (and yourself) on french. The narration is done by a female voice with a strong french accent. There's 6 lessons and each one introduces new vocabulary. The animation is a little slow, but I think that is exactly what I like about it. It doesn't overwhelm your little ones and gives them plenty of time to repeat. My kids, 3 and 5 yo, love to repeat and sing along and don't seem to get bored with the repetition. Remember, repeating is a good way to learn that really captives young children attention. I can't wait to see the other 2 volumes."
4,Yes for beginner,The graphic is not too good but the content is great to introduce French to the children
5,Excellent DVD For Any Age!,"I was not sure as to what I will be getting. I have bought another DVD from Language Tree and it was awful. This one is very good and very engaging. I am very happy to have ordered this. I have already ordered volume 2 and 3 of it. I can watch this with my one year old over and over again. She will grow up bilingual there is no question about it. But most of all my 8 year old enjoys watching this DVD as well. It is an amazing language DVD for kids. I highly recommend it. I speak Urdu, Hindi, Punjabi and Arabic besides English. This will be my fifth language learning experience and probably the best one. Good Luck!"
4,nautilus shoes,"These shoes are very comfortable, even if your on your feet for extended period of time. I would buy these shoes again."
4,Nice Camera,"Perfect for a first digital camera, found camera and software easy to learn and use. Has twice the memory card for many in it's price range, potentially saving you some cash. Battery time is terrible, doesn't last more than a week although this could be typical I don't know. I've seen this exact camera cheaper at a couple different places, Costco being one, so shop around if looking at this particular model. Happy with my purchase!!"
3,Blurry pictures,"I use an Olympus C2000 at work, so thought the same brand and highly recommended camera model would be worth a try at several $$$ less....boy was I mistaken. Actually, the D-520 has some really cool features. The 2 in 1 mode and movie modes are very useful. Unfortunatley I can't find a way to change the shutter speed (even though the manual lists about 5 different speeds.)Way too many of my pictures turn out blurry.This has NEVER been a problem with the C2000...I get GREAT pictures every time. I am returning the 520 tomorrow to Circuit City and will exchange for the latest version of my work camera (C-3020)"
3,blurry,I don't like the d-520 one bit. You just can't get the clairity that you get from 35mm. i am looking for something better.
5,AWESOME SERVICE,Customer Service is just great. They keep in touch with you from the beginning of the process until you receive the product. They make sure that you are happy with the product. They make you feel at ease about your purchase. You receive your product in a timely manner and everything comes shipped properly. Will use them whenever I need to order a DVD if they are on the list.
5,"A lot of great songs, easy to listen to!","I bought this to replace an old vinyl LP I had, and because I love the song ""Sanctuary"". The majority of this album is well done and very easy to listen too. Easily worth the price."
5,Dion at his best..,"Most folks have never heard these albums fromDion. Do not hesitate, buy them. The songs are mellow for the most andthe songs follow his life.""Sit down old Friend"" is very powerful in its context. The title song isoutstanding. Beautiful songs as well with a message that you will findnon-abrasive. It shows a growth that was taking place in his life fromdrugs to God. Don't freak out now. He isn't preaching in his songs.But, I guarantee you that you will want to play them over and over.Happy listening, Jim..!!!"
3,fine flute,"a fine flute for a kid, as a first flute it fills the bill. it took a wile to ship, from hon kong."
5,Love this Granola and so do my kids!,"I tried this Enjoy Life and the Udi's granola and preferred this one, not as difficult to chew. Great flavor and my three and four year old love it! Highly recommend to anyone."
3,The Last Bullet,This was the first Cleo North book I read. Will order otherbooks. I like the character of Cleo. Good writing and story.
5,Had these batteries in my Digital Scale for months...,"These are extremely dependable batteries, and the price is unbelievable. I am using them in a digital shipping scale and have not had any problems after nearly 3 months of daily use."
2,I couldn't make it work.,"While one of the other reviewers states that it only works on some types of champagne bottles, I couldn't get it to work at all. I tried it on two different shapes of bottles, but to no avail. The problem is that the ring that is supposed to slide down the neck to secure the stopper doesn't slide when it's on the bottle. When off the bottle, the mechanism works fine. It appears to me that the stopper must be made for a specific bottle and not for most champagne bottles in general. At least that was my experience. I found a good $3.00 stopper at Sur la Table that works just fine and is not dependent on the shape of the champagne bottle. It doesn't have the fancy pour spout, but at least it keeps the bubbles in the champagne."
2,very happy with how quickly it was delivered,"the book is not very well written, took me months to read it. several areas are written so poorly you have to re-read several times before you can figure out what the writer is talking about."
4,The one that started it all,very good game. it is somewhat retro but its nice to go back every now and then. the age factor is only a problem with NVidia 8xxx series graphics cards. but a simple patch to purefaction and it runs like a charm
3,Overrated,"Much has been made of the ability to find your own path through this game's destructible terrain. Well, it's a beginning but the actual design does not really cater to this feature. Once out of the mine, this is more and more the stuff of standard first-person shooters and, given the weak physics engine, the actual blowing-up is so heavily scripted that it often feels as though you're being led by the nose. (If you get creative, you may find unsupported pieces of terrain hanging in mid-air.) The series did not begin to fire on all cylinders until Guerilla."
1,Rightfully so to retire this thing,"This cordless phone has battery charging issues and unit will get very hot after charging it, then recharging it. Afterwards, battery pack is dead and will no longer work."
3,O.k. trilogy...,"Just got Wrong Turn 3 for my 1 year anniversary today. I was extremely pumped, because I own the other 2. It's not bad, just a little different from the rest. The start of the film has young people ""as usual"" rafting down the river in the backwoods. Well, they are killed off, all but 1 girl in the first 5 min.Then for the last hour and more, we see a bunch of convicts wondering around the woods getting killed by 1 or 2 hillbillys. That's it.It is a good slasher flick in my opinion. It's a necessary piece to complete the trilogy. I just wish it would of had a little more story behind it, instead of a mess of mindless kills. Not that I mind mindless kills, I still liked it and is worth the watch, but it was lacking something. Just my thoughts. Enjoy..."
4,IT was ok,Number 4 is my fav but this one was pretty good they just keep coming with these interesting hillbilly deformed creatures which i love because it's different
3,Wrong turn III,"Not half as thrilling as Wrong Turn I : the situation is predictable, we already know what is expecting the people in these woods, and so there is much less suspense. Also I think the make up of ""3 Fingers"", the main degenerate villain, isn't as good as in the very first movie, it looks artificial and really made up. The ""good"" characters either, aren't so lovable as the first bunch of tourists who get trapped in these woods : it is hard to sympathize with a bunch of convicts, it is a group villains against one single villain. The first movie was exciting, in the same way as the movie ""Deliverance"", the 3rd one is just a slasher as there are so many."
3,"OK, depending on what you're looking for","This DVD gives a good sense of the damage earthquakes can do and the difficulties involved in predicting them, but doesn't really go very deep into seismology or earthquake engineering. From my structural engineer's perspective, I found it rather superficial, even for leisurely weekend watching. But other audiences may get more out of it than I did."
2,Tastes imitation,"I think this brand is good for the severely allergenic, but, alas, the taste isn't like regular granola. The berries taste imitation, in a sweet-sticky way."
3,the finger.,I gave my boss the finger for christmas.... I always wanted to do that! Not sure that he ever used it. But it served it's purpose for me. :)
3,The pocket translator is too abbreviated,"This review concerns the pocket translator. I wanted to warn people that are about to purchase this set that the pocket translator is so abbreviated that I think it may be harmful. For instance, when translating the verb ""fly"" it gives you ""mouche"" which I think is the insect and definitely not the verb that the Rosetta Stone Explorer has used (voler). When you input ""voler"" into the French-English translation it outputs ""rob."" Apparently ""voler"" has many definitions in English and without supplying the user with the majority of those definitions this translator could be very frusturating in France (and maybe get you into a little trouble).I had to rate this product for my review to be posted, but my rating only concerns the pocket translator!"
1,A waste of time,"Bought v4, but had to download upgrade for it to work. Then had to call to get new key, then again to get auth #. Took 40 min to determine what to transfer on old computer. Another 40 min to transfer to new computer using TCP/IP direct connect. However, many of the programs would not work. Had to remove Office XP and reload. This took less time then trying to transfer the Office programs that would not work. Better to re-load programs and use XP transfer wizard to transfer your settings. Customer support was marginal."
1,"poor performance, worse service","Not only did i have to undo (which still left my computer a mess), but the ""returns"" agent was one of the most rigid, abusive, nasty people I've ever had to deal with."
1,vacuum marinater,"product worked fine about 8 - 10 times, then pump valve failed.manufacturer web site inactive. i'd stay away from them.ray bissonette"
1,Technically Flawed Idea,"As a chemical engineer, I can honestly say the pressure isn't going to make one wit of difference unless you can get the pressure inside the MEAT to be LESS than in the CONTAINER (NOT vice-versa which is the best this contraption can ever do)."
2,"Well, it WAS great...","...until it broke. It cracked under it's own pressure. My husband really liked this and it worked well for last minute marinating (not that it can replace hours of marinating), until he was pumping it one day and it wouldn't seal - then we realized the lid had cracked. Am I the only one this has happened to?"
2,bottom fell out,"I grill probably 4 out of the 7 days of the week. I have to echo one of the other reviewer's comments. I guess I pumped it too many times and the bottom exploded, marinade everywhere. Consider yourself warned."
2,Vegetarians think twice,"I'm a vegan. Therefore, about the only thing I marinate is tofu. I hoped this would do for tofu what it does for meat, but it doesn't. The problem is, I'm guessing, ""pores."" The principal is that when you take the air out of the chamber, the pores in the meat open and allow the marinade to enter.I did my own consumer test...put some tofu and marinade in it, and some in a plastic baggy. As tofu is white and the marinade was brown, it would be real easy to see how far ""in"" the marinade went. I checked each at various times and there really wasn't any difference. Neither of them got the marinade ""in"" very far. I'm guessing it's because tofu doesn't have any ""pores"" to open (and neither would tempeh).I have not tried it on vegetables, mainly because I don't marinate vegetables.... I'm keeping it just in case somewhere down the road I want to marinate any vegetables. But I'm still using the disposable plastic bag for the tofu as it's less to wash."
3,Not Great,"This movie is alright.The plot was good, but I expected much more.The villans are toatally stupid and rini's voice is really annoying. Sailor moon R is much better."
3,Fun pictures - Spartan information,"Do the math 1,017-pages, only 700 dedicated to film the rest is an index of artists. Now in the 700 pages we have to stuff small four"" square photos (about one per page), a few larger photos (all black and white), and 9,000 films (1896-1999); that leaves approximately one inch and a half page column to describe the title main actors and writing source.Some of the pictures ar fun, just knowing the film is made is useful. However that is all there is."
2,Uh-huh?,"A sideshow for serious students of Shakespeare; required reading only for the specialist who must read everything. Next to Harrison, a puny (and manic) contributor to scholarship."
2,This product is B S !,"It bends just as nicely for you as the Eflite BCP/P original gear/mainshaft combo! Learn how to straighten the original by eye while in the airframe and that goes a LONG way towards saving money! Just paint one side of top hub yellow and the other side green. Raise throttle stick while holding heli in place on workbench and WATCH the colors and wobble direction. Now bend by hand accordingly to get it straight.FYI: I had to do this with this stainless shaft item so DON'T get robbed on bogus Chinese goods here either... Fix your own on the fly! When you get good at it, you can do it on the roof of the car by eye and be up in the air in 5 mins. or less!Go for it!"
4,Better than nothing,"Except for a page devoted to both European and Asian Turkey nothing east of 30E is covered: thus no Moscow, no Kiev, no Crimea; and countries such as Finland, Latvia, Bulgaria, Greece, etc. are at a 1:4,5 scale rather than 1:8. Still, it's a pretty good reference tool (and at a pretty good price, especially if you buy it from one of Amazon's new/used vendors)."
2,Disappointed,"Not the book I expected. Not very helpful in improving a player's game. The book that helps me the most is one where moves are explained clearly and without excessive ""what if"" type lines."
4,"sweet, great for little kids","THis is a gentle video series with some nice songs. My daughter and sons have loved it.OK, one problem. Something about the way the alligator is drawn against certain backgrounds occasionally make his teeth look like they are covered in red. A little accidental gory image for a nice kids video. Fortunately, he is a minor character in few of the shows."
2,"Ugh, terrible...!!","We like the ""Maisy"" books -- good, simple, colorful stories, not a lot of intellectual heft. But good golly, these animated shorts are just terrible!!! The narrator sounds completely bored (and secretly contemptuous of the material) and the character voices consist mainly of moronic giggle-babbles that sound a lot like the TeleTubbies. It's really insulting to the intelligence of even the youngest viewers. Plus, the age group that this is suited to developmentally (one-year olds) shouldn't be watching videos anyway: recent studies suggest that watching TV -- any kind of TV -- in the first two years of life holds back language development and shortens attention span. This video is not worth the risk. (Axton)"
5,A little long but works good,"I was using an old standard rca cord I had pulled in half...started using this and can tell a little bit of a difference...pushing my 450 watt powered klipsche sub. I have a sweet Klipsche setup in my movie theatre...150"" HD screen...epson powerlight 8350...sweetass projector BTW...anyhow one thing I did notice is that my auto on/off is now working on my sub so it turns off with my receiver...wasn't working before with the regular half RCA...and OH YEA it came with the spliter too!!! They make quality cables for sure....would buy another if I had to"
4,Good price for quality,"these speakers has great sound, and is a pretty good deal. I use my speakers a lot, and i find them very reliable."
3,average,"This CD was a real disappointment after Buzzin' Fly 2. It was not awful, but nothing out of the ordinary, and in fact rather boring. Buzzin' Fly 1 and 2 were fresh and full of surprises; I highly recommend starting with either of those volumes. Volume 3 is not worth buying (even used) unless you must have all things Ben Watt."
5,Small Cute Helpful Book on Dreams,"I bought this little book a few days after I had a very strange dream. I find it helpful understanding why we dream and how we can use dreams to get in touch with our mind in a way that we cannot do while we are awake. The book does not end with mere interpretations of dreams; instead, it explains what we can do when we have dreams with negative implications. Also the book explains some dreams have less importance and need no interpretations. Having read this book, I no longer feel that a scary dream simply means something bad. The use of this book requires no knowledge of Kabbalistic views. I recommend this book to those who are wondering what dreaming itself means and how dreams correlate to actual life."
3,Interesting...but strangely organized,"Nice attempt to approach literature with scientific methodology, which is like a breath of fresh air in the current irrational climate of literary theory. But the book is very strangely organized: there are three chapters, about graphs, maps, and trees! It's like writing a physics book called ""Equations, diagrams, curves"". With a chapter for each, without regard for the natural, substantive subdivisions in the field. Or it would be like organizing a library of books by size rather than subject. Science isn't about nice graphs, but about making hypotheses and testing them on data. FM simply makes a graph, chart, or tree, and comments on it. Commendable attempt. But a modest beginning. And an annoying manner to write without verbs."
5,Loved this book!,"This is my favorite of all the Alan Gregory series. I really like his cast of characters and they are all featured in this book. Plus I was fascinated with the therapy sessions with the airline crash survivor. This is a fast paced, can't put-it-down kind of book. Highly recommended!"
2,In All but Blood,"Elfquest used to be fun. No, really. It was hokey at times, but it took itself seriously which gave the hokiness an endearing quality, it had lovely art, and it sometimes actually had something genuine to say.Over the past years, ever more Elfquest books have come out, and while some of them have been OK, more have been increasingly bad, until this is the worst of all.Yes, it's nice to see Pini-like art back (though in a careless and occasionally mutant-looking form), but the stories here are beyond saccharine. They're like eating a bag of sugar. The dialogue is unspeakably awful-- poor Strongbow is made to say ""Scramble and ramble!"" at one especially low point. It's as if the whole thing were a Highlander II -esque self-parody.Gag. Avoid it."
1,Great wire ... NO PLUGS!,"I ordered wire / plug combo because it was a good deal for them both, otherwise I really didn;t need that much wire. Anyway, it arrived packaged nicely ... at leaste the WIRE arrived. No plugs. The item discription says ""Includes (8) 24k gold-plated connector pins"" and the picture shows 8 banana plugs! Wheeeeerrres the plugs (in a classic where's the beef sort of way)So I called Amazon ... they said sorry etc etc we'll send you out another one. So they did. It arrived ... NO PLUGS!!! I even unrolled the spool thinking that maybe it was under the wire etc etc. Nope! Nothing!So called Amazon back up ... they said that they would give me a credit for the plugs ... $16 I think and I then ordered some different (and really cool) banana plugs.A.R. wire is really nice and super quality wire and I'm glad I purchased that ... just not all the trouble.So, A+++++ for Amazon and their customer support. BIG HISS and BOO for the combo that is listed. It's wrong and inaccurate."
3,lot of no names but cute anyway,"hey, it's cheap and lots of movies so go for itcute storylinesno name actors overall but the kids got a kick out of them!"
5,Fast,"Product was delivered on time and in new condition, as stated. This was a gift to someone who just got a DVD player. I have them already and they are all great movies. Just saw the new one in Imax last night and loved it too!"
1,Watchdog,"I cannot agree with the previous reviewer's opinion regarding The Orton Diaries. Tangiers in the 1960's was a paedophile's paradise and please God, it no longer exists as such. Orton and Halliwell used young boys for their own gratification little thinking of the damage they were inflicting on them. Orton's diaries are full of his hedonistic pursuits and talented as a playwrite he may have been, for the sake of those children he abused, the publishers of The Orton Diaries, Methuen, should be banned from ever publishing further copies of his diary."
4,Good quality for such low prices,"Like others, I read the reviews before purchasing the items. I ordered Aaragon & Le ciel and didn't expect much since they are mainly for everyday uses. I was so surprise with the quality. In addition, mine only have minor imperfections, not scratches like stated in other reviews. I must be lucky. The weight is pretty good. I would say the quality is about the same as Oneida, which I'm using. I'm thinking of buying a couple more sets. Of course, not recommended for gifts since they come in a plain carbon boxes. In short, I'm really satisfied with the quality (shiny & heavy) at such low prices."
5,Wonderful product!,"I've used this on my children and their children! It's wonderful for the skin and hair. Never once did the babies develop cradle cap or skin problems. (And it's great for Mom's face! Very, very gentle.) No harsh fragrance - just a light ""baby"" smell! Love it!"
5,this cd is greeeeeaaatttt!!!,"E.G. daily is a great singer and songwriter. she has one of the most distinctive voices around.Some of the best songs on this cd are -the wall,keep it togheher,and someday.Her awesome cover of Amy Grants's ""breath of heaven"" can bring u to tears. buy it -buy it.-"
2,Just not my cup of tea.,"I bought this being a Pare` fan but it is just a lousy movie. There is a major premise in the script that you only find out in the end ( and I won't spoil it just in case you rent this or buy it) once known makes you go"" why the heck would he do that?"". It does not move well and the actual ""star"" is the Russian that befriends him when his daughter is kidnapped by ""The Red Serpent"" to force Pare` 's character into being a drug ""mule"" for him. A lot of real snow and cold and not much meat.. so to speak. Only watch this on a day you are REALLY bored.."
2,Bulky - Hard to work with,This wire is gawdy looking and huge. The insulation is extremely hard to strip and there is a huge gap between the two wires that just looks strange. The bannana plugs it comes with are a joke. I would not purchase this wire again.
5,Great challenge in a puzzle game!,"We purchased this game as something for the whole family. It has been what we expected it to be. It has levels for our 6 year old and levels for those of us who have been doing puzzles for years. Very challenging, but an easy game to manipulate and use. I would recommend it for anyone who loves puzzles."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT,"SMD rework died after second time unit turned on!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Went to the manufacturers website and it looks like a mickey mouse operation!!!!! I just send an e-mail but by the shady look of their website I doubt they will even get back to me.It's amazing that in 2009, with the extensive support other other manufacturers provide, this company thinks the way they operate is acceptable.KEEP LOOKING DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT"
1,Worked for 5 minutes,"I write this after several letters to the seller - with no reply. The light worked for app. 5 minutes, started to smoke and died. I hate no communication - maybe now I'll hear from him. Buyer - be ware! Oh, and by the way - I bought this for my son - I don't take lightly to people selling defective stuff - for my son or any kids!"
5,AWESOME BOOK!,"This was a gift for a friend's Son, he LOVED it! I also have a copy and would suggest this book to any bird lover!God Bless! Suson Hare-Albert"
1,Hole is too small for toys to spill; not good for babies,"I thought this would be fun for my baby to spill out the toys and stuff back in, while also making her feel comfortable with sports items. Unfortunately, getting these plush balls out of the bag is not easy. If I assume that all the toys are manufactured the same, then you will find that you really have to dig and pull the balls in & out with some dexterity. Not accomplished by babies.Either I got one where the space from the top of the bag is too small, in which case the manufacturing on this toy is poor, or the hole at the top of the bag is designed to be quite small, in which case this is a toy designed for much older children.The balls are also too large for my 6 month old's hands. She has very little interest in this toy. In retrospect, I would probably have opted for the more expensive, but possibly better, Gund plus sports balls. They appear smaller."
4,Great for infants,"We bought these for our 4 month old son and he loves them. They are soft enough for him and safe because they cant get any filling out of them. The only thing I would change is to make the rattle in the one ball better, but other then that I am happy with this set."
4,Good purchase.,"This product is just as described. I bought it for my husband, he assembled it, (not the easiest to assemble.)It holds both of our golf bags and stores our shoes and misc. items. All in all a good product."
3,Great Product,"This product comes in a lot of pieces and takes some time to put together. However, once it is assembled it is great. It is sturdy and functional and organizes a closet, garage or bedroom corner nicely."
1,Missing Parts - on 2 shipments!!,"The first organizer that was shipped was missing parts. Amazon sent out another organizer and IT WAS ALSO missing parts - the same parts as the first set plus 3 additional pieces. By this time I was 4 hours into the project just trying to figure out which metal tubes I needed to assemble a complete unit. I called the manufacuter and they ""CONFESSED"" they had been having issues with their supplier. Nice of them to be proactive and notifiy their customers. Three and a half weeks after my initial order, the missing tubes came and I was finally able to complete the project. My advice is to stay away from this hassle. I wish I had just ordered the more expensive golf organizer from Frontgate - available on Amazon."
5,Ketchum at his best,"This is the quintessential Jack Ketchum short fiction collection. A great place to start for the reader who wants to accquaint himself with the author's work.The stories in this lengthy collection range from the eerie and disheartening, such as ""The Box"" and ""Sundays,"" to the deeply disturbing, ""Megan's Law"", ""the Rifle"" to morbidly funny tales such as ""The Great San Diego Sleazy Bimbo Massacre"" and ""The Business."" There's even a few western ghost stories included.Powerful, brutal, and unrelenting, Ketchum pulls no punches ad does the unthinkable to sympathetic characters. This book ranks up there with King's ""Night Shift"" and Barker's ""Books of Blood"" as one of the best horror short fiction collections ever."
5,"Tastes like yummy chocolate cookies w/ nuts, but aren't!","These are great cookies for those on a healthier diet, or restricted diet that is Gluten-free &/or nut free!These taste wonderful! Great chocolate, soft & creamy, without the allergens found in most cookies & other pastries!These will make it easier to transition over to a gluten-free diet, or nut-free diet, or simply for those wanting to eat a healthier diet, yet still want that occasional treat!The small, no-overly sweet chocolate chips taste nutty, so it tastes like it has nuts when it really doesn't.Small amount of food for the money, but a nice treat!"
3,buy these at the grocery store for less $$,I buy Enjoy life cookies every week. I thought it might be cheaper to use my amazon prime to order them and have them shipped. Well at the store I pay 3.79 a box(for all flavors) the price here on amazon is horrible. Look elsewhere for a better price. These cookies are great if anyone in your family has food allergies just don't pay 5 bucks a box for them!
4,Good chocolate-y taste,"These cookies are a really great alternative for people who can't have the common allergens. The texture of the cookies are alittle grainy, but it has a good chocolate flavor."
1,Poor customer service,Warning--do not sign up for their Internet course. I would rate them lower than one star if I could.
4,Great Resource - Good Value,"I find this text to be easy to read and understand, and with the companion CD which emulates the actual computer testing environment I recommend it as a great resource for the Series 7 & 63 tests. At this price for a textbook and a CD its also a great value. This resource is not all inclusive and you should also supplement your knowledge base with additional resources and classes if possible."
1,Do Not Buy This,"Okay, I know this 2 CD set looks impressive, and with the amazing song line-up it has, it should sound impressive too. It doesn't. The tracks are not original soundtrack recordings, but instead are played by the World Film Orchestra. I'm pretty sure, after listening to the discs, that the World Film Orchestra is a synthesizer in the record label's antiquated studio. Avoid this like the plague."
4,Uniden EZ1996 Review,"I like the large screen and battery life. Also, the flashing red lights when the phone rings are hard to miss. Overall, and okay cordless phone."
4,Uniden Cordless Telephone,"We're very pleased with the ability to enhance the hearing of the caller on the phone since my husband and I are both hearing impaired. We love the appearance of the phone also. The only exception that we take is we feel the ringer on the phone could be a little louder. All in all, we are very pleased with the phone. Our previous cordless (still in use) was a Uniden and we've been very happy with it."
2,Hard to See,I bought this phone for my visually impaired mother hoping see would be able to see the caller ID number on the display. Good idea but not happening. The name and number display is so poor she can't see it at all. The contrast between the name and number and the background is terrible. In addition when the phone is hung on the wall to allow the display to face outward it is very difficult to hang the phone in the cradle. The phone must be positioned perfectly to catch the latch or hook that holds it otherwise it will fall out. That is not easy for anyone that has poor vision and made even more difficult for someone with artrithis. The only reason I didn't return the phone is it has a loud ringer that lights up.
3,Decent Entry Level Subwoofer,"This is a good subwoofer with a decent selection of options, for a reasonably low price. If you've never bought a subwoofer before and don't want to spend an arm and a leg, this is a good model to start out with."
4,Shakin in my Pants~!,"I just got this puppy today and i was so excited to hook it up. It's providing good bass and rumble, just what i was looking for. I guess from other subwoofer's i've heard, this isn't as clean sounding. But if you're just in for the rumble like i am (in a small dorm room) then this will do just fine. I hooked it up to my minisystem and its sending vibrations through the walls like a jackhammer gone wild~! awoooooo jk but yeah, for the price of this sub, i think it's totally worth it. Good luck on your midterms! Oh, and remember: A crane's feather rustles in the water like a grasshopper's song cries to the offspring of a cow."
2,Difference of Opinion,"Unfortunately, my experience with Sonic Blue has been the opposite of what others have experienced. Although the product was highly recommended, I have been nothing but frustrated since my purchase.I was unable to connect my Replay TV via S-video or other cables, because Replay could not ""see"" my cable box. Once connected, it would not record, no matter what I did. When I contacted Sonic Blue, I was on hold for over 30 minutes before speaking with a representative, who seemed unsure of how to help me. In the end, I asked to return/exchange for a new model, as I am willing to believe that my unit is defective, and was told that I should pay shipping costs.Hopefully, Sonic Blue will help me, but until then I hold reservations about this product."
2,A dissapointing follow-up...,"'Second Chants' is a sequel to Reclaiming's original collection, simply titled 'Chants'. Where the first provided some great and inspiring pieces meant to be learned and used in circle, 'Second Chants' feels flat and uninspired. While one or two tracks are enjoyable, overall I felt let-down by this piece preferring instead to return to the original album for inspiration. I say buy 'Chants' instead and wait to see if they release a better third installment in the series."
5,Great product,"I've been using this product for over 2years and is great! It not only keeps your skin clean/moisturized, but also has a aroma which makes you feel fresh! Recently, i moved to Asia and will probably be there for 1-2yrs, and have tried all other companies - Body Shop/Bath-Body Works and havn't found anything better than this.Funny, I'm having this shipped by Amazon to Asia - costing me 3times the price, but its going to be worth it!"
4,Reunion with friends of my childhood,"It's been over twenty years since I last read a book of this series. My youngest son handed it to me to read, and I must say that I enjoyed it immensely. It was great to be reunited with the brilliant Jupiter Jones, the resilient Peter Crenshaw, and the tough Bob Andrews (the 3 Investigators).For all of my enjoyment why did I give it only 4 stars? Well, I've progressed to Agatha Christie, Leslie Charteris, Rex Stout, et al, in my adult years and, even though thoroughly enjoying reminiscing with this book, it still remains geared for pre-teen sensibilities and is slightly childish.But healthy adulthood requires a nice dose of the childish from time to time. Read it, or one of the others in the series, and give your sanity time to recharge."
4,"adidas Men's Samba Millenium Soccer Shoe,Running White/Black/Gold","It is comfortable and more ""modern"" looking than the original. It also has more room in the toe if that is needed. The only con is that it makes your feet look bigger than the original Samba."
2,don't buy,"got these shoes here for indoor and was very unimpressed, it sizes big, i am 11.5 shoe size and was bigger than some 12's i own even though ordered 11.5. VERY UNPREDICTABLE. all of my other indoor shoes I have never had the same problem with. definitely not meant for juggling. good for dribble. shooting is almost rigid with these shoes. no flexibility to give that ball the right curve."
5,Great shoes!,"I had a pair of shoes similar to these a few years ago and really enjoyed using them for both indoor soccer and general everyday use. After having these for a few days I can tell they need be broken in a little bit, but they're great overall."
3,Works well but is drying,"I like cleansers that are gentle and don't have a bunch of weird chemicals in them, especially salicylic acid (it always makes me break out). This is a simple bar cleanser that does the job, keeps my face clear and healthy. Unfortunately though, it is a little too drying for long term use."
2,A little too violent for the kids,"This just really seemed a little too violent for the kids. It makes me think the ten commandments needs to be modernized. It pretty much showed a kid that hits his mother will be killed, etc. Not exactly what I want my 8 year olds reading. The brick bibles are much better"
4,Great Keyboard,"I've had this keyboard for more than a year now and would recommend it without any problem. Main reason would be that it places your left and right hand at a much better distance. I have not had any wrist problems since getting it. Besides the gaming keypad, the keyboard part works great, very good ""clicky"" feel to the keys. I mainly play Warcraft, and it has definitely improved my skills. I took one star off because the number-pad is hard to use, as they combine the ""insert"", ""pgdn"", keys and the numbers, and what the keys have printed on them don't correspond to the actual in-game function."
4,Minor quirks,"Only real problem I have is the orientation of the game pad keys. Gel wrist pad would help too. Placement of some of the keyboard keys (delete, num lock, etc.) takes some getting used to."
3,non stick didn't last,"I am a little disappointed with this pan. I have many of the Analon Suregrip pans, most of them baking pans, and all have performed well...except this one. It is large enough and I love the rack. But it seems the non-stick began disappearing after only 5 or 6 uses. So in the beginning it was easy to clean but not any longer. I don't know why but it seems the non-stick coating is wearing off. I loved the pan while the non-stick lasted but it's becoming more difficult to clean the more I use it."
1,Similar bad experiences,"I completely concur with the negative postings recently added. In a nutshell, the issues I experienced are as follows:- System freezes- VERY slow response time to change channels- Component video connections do not work - only able to use coax- Customer service is horrible - I was on hold for over an hour to get through to an agent who did little more than confirm that the problems I am experiencing are known bugs with the 5000 line.I'm definitely returning the product, although I may give the previous model or Tivo a shot."
1,Grossly Unreliable; Miserable Customer Service,"My unit failed three days after installation. The machine locked up and rebooting did not correct the problem. ReplayTV's poor customer service exacerbated the experience. The representative was pleasant but lacked any technical expertise. Her supervisor was downright insolent. After considerable aggravation, I returned the unit.The choice is simple: roll the dice with ReplayTV, or settle for Tivo and eliminate a possible headache."
1,And still on hold.............,"I don't even have my replay tv yet. I wanted to ask a question about wireless networking so I called their support line. Well I've been on hold for 30 minutes now and no signs of ever talking to somebody. So instead of asking my question, I'm just going to cancel my order. This is ridiculous!"
1,Hard to stomach...to say the least,"These bars are abysmal. The taste is tough to describe, as it is just generally ""appalling"" and the texture really is disgusting. You're better off eating nothing than having these as part of your diet."
1,Terrible...who came up with this?,"Hugely dissapointing. I can't imagine there's a customer buying this product after the first purchase. Overpriced to say the least: 3.99 plus tax. The ""bars"" are oversized tootsie rolls in size, they must have used a supoer-zoom lens when they took the picture and if you threw one at someone,you'd send them to the hospital, they were hard as rocks. Tastes like chewing chalk that gets slimey but has a chocolate taste to it at some point. I want to know who thought it was a good idea to sell these? Threw them all out..and I dislike wasting food, but this is not food."
1,not like the enjoy life cookies,I thought these would be more like the cookies. My son is very picky and won't eat these but LOVES the cookies.
1,terrible,"I can eat barely anything as my son (who is breastfeeding) is allergic to most foods, and I still threw away all but the half of one bar that I ate. Absolutely terrible and my standards are pretty low at this point. I love Enjoylife's cookies and chocolate chips, but not these!"
1,most misleading packaging EVER,"These bars are dense, chewy, and dry. I didn't find them as horrible as other reviewers, but it seems like a lot of them are negative because it USED to be a great product. What infuriates me is the size of the product, which is NOTHING LIKE the picture on the package, and barely half the size of the individual wrapper! I wouldn't even call it a bar, it's only slightly rectangular, more like a small thumbnail-shaped chunk. Definitely check out the video that one reviewer posted to show the actual size. I certainly won't buy these again, and it makes me want to boycott the company, even if they make other, better-tasting GF products."
3,Enjoy Life Cocoa Loco bars,"The Cocoa Loco bars are okay, but I preferred their original recipe for them! The ""new and improved"" recipe isn't as good. They are drier and the texture is to powdery, too much like eating cocoa powder. The original was more like a chocolate granola bar. Hope they bring back the original soon."
2,"Less like chocolate, more like dates","As with other Enjoy Life products, these bars are either ""love 'em!"" or ""hate 'em!"" They just don't taste like chocolate to me - they taste more like they have a lot of dried fruit in them. However, they are more than gluten free, they are egg, dairy, AND gluten free, and organic to boot, so with that profile, it's hard to duplicate any delicious snack bar.I do like the slight crunchy texture they have. For what you get in the box, they are expensive, but most GF products are."
2,Grainy texture... not very chocolatey,"After reading several reviews, I thought these would be good, but decided to buy a box at Meijer before I bought in bulk on Amazon. I'm glad I did. They have a grainy texture and are not very chocolate-y at all! I bake a lot of my own gluten free, sugar free treats, so maybe it's because I was expecting them to taste like what I usually bake, but they are not very good unless you are used to more of a chocolate flavored cardboard bar."
4,"There were several things, especially kid-friendly things, we ...","There were several things, especially kid-friendly things, we liked about Zest. Number one was that we could find it easily when the kids dropped it in the tub. Blue is an excellent color for soap. We also liked that it didn't just disintegrate as soon as it was dropped in a hot bath. The smell was refreshing compared to the spaghetti-smeared faces of my four-year-old and my 18-month-old. We would have gone through two bars of any other soap by now, but we haven't gone through even one zest bar yet. I would recommend this to my mommy-friends. My kids have sensitive skin and this soap caused no breakouts."
4,I have used Zest in the past quite ...,I have used Zest in the past quite a bit and I like the soap. Our family really liked the scent of this soap. It lathers really well and rinses off without any residue. There wasn't anything I could say negative about Zest soap -- we will continue to use it and purchase it in the future.
2,Not exactly what I was hoping to find.,This is not the product I remember. Took way to long to get here. Afraid to reorder. Very disappointed all the way around.
5,Smart and simple exercises,"I am a very big fan of the Feldenkrais technique and am in the process of reading as much as I can about it.The exercises in this book are simple but effective, and very clearly explained.A nice add to my library.To people interested to know more about the methode I would definitely recommend to purchase Moshe Feldenkrais books as well."
5,searching high and low,"I have been looking for the perfect receiving blanket and I found it! Trust me mom's I've tryed the Gerber, Carter's and others and they are all ""flannel type"" that are way to small and get bally after one washing! These are great because they are large and soft. They also will last a very long time."
2,It's a mess at best,"This was my first Patterson book and I'd say, unfortunately, it was fair at best. I guess I will try another one of his books as many say what a great writer he is, but ""See How They Run"" is not impressive at all.First, the story line is completely unbelieveable. Jews avenging the holocoust by using Nazi techniques and an American gynacologist as the super action hero just doesn't work. Add on top of that a hectic and confusing end, paper thin characters, an unbelieveable romantic relationship between hero and heroin, storyline tangents that don't fit into the overall plot, and what you end up with is basically a mess.Maybe 2 stars is kind, but I'll hope his other books are significantly better."
2,Would Be Hard to Recommend This Book,"I have read many of JP's books and find this is not one of his fast-paced, keep you on the edge of your seat, waiting to turn the next page books. It has several implausible, seeming contrived ideas (microwaving entire dormitories!). The main character has suffered the loss of all his immediate family and a wife he cherishes by terrorists, but quickly takes up with an old girlfriend who is also (unbeknownst to him) one of the bad-guys. Seemed very contrived and a bit stereotypical, i.e. all the Jewish Holocaust survivors in the book had become wealthy and internationally known personages. We all know this wasn't (isn't) the case."
3,A Great Mouse Chase,"I had only read one James Patterson book before this one, When the Wind Blows, and I loved it. It had a great and unusual plot line. See How They Run has a very unusual plot line also. The book is about two WWII concentration camp surviors that are trying to prevent the Nazis from terrorizing the world again. David Strauss and Alix Rothchild fly to Germany to retrace David's brother's steps in making his film, The Forth Commandment, and to search for a man named Michael Ben-Iban. For David this might be his chance to find out why his brother was murdered and for Alix the trip was a terror filled and business trip. There are many plot twists that will make you think, ""Why didn't I think of that earlier?"" James Patterson has masterfully placed history in an exciting mouse chase that will leave you satisfied. I recommend you read this book"
2,"See How They Run, James Patterson",Mostly propaganda. Very disappointing compared to other James Patterson novels. I definitely would not suggest reading this book and did not pass it on to friends.
2,See How They Run,Simple. Dont like it. There were gaps in the story line. The characters didnt have enough supporting material to make them rememberable. And the summary was misleading. It started off good but ran out of steam. Got good and ran out of steam again. I can honestly say I found a James Patterson book I didnt like after reading it. The first book I read by James Patterson was Violets Are Blue then 3rd Degree and I've been hooked ever since. But unless you just want to read every book he's ever wrote then I suggest you leave this one on the shelf of your local book store.
3,could be better,"This gets the job done, but one of the hinges on the lid already broke off. I've only been using it for 3 weeks. I don't really NEED the lid so it's ok, but it's a bummer that it broke so quickly."
4,I really liked this product! My face feels ...,"I really liked this product! My face feels so clean and healthy after using it. Neutrogena isn't filled with chemicals and fragrances, so it would be great for a person with sensitive skin. If you have a sensitive nose, however, it may not be the bar for you because it doesn't smell too pretty! I'd definitely recommend it to my family and friends, especially to those who are more natural and holistic minded."
3,A real hoot!,"There's only one Ma & Pa kettle. We've all heard of them, but seldom seen on the TV today. Not a bad add to the DVD collection - 5 hours of chuckles on a rainy sunday is worth the price of admission."
5,Relive your youth!,"These movies are in amazing condition! Even better than when we watched them in the 60's. A great way to relive your youth and share some FUN decent entertainment with your family today! Imagine that... entertaining(and still funny) without any sex, violence or reality... just sit back and enjoy!"
2,Why not a true boxed set?,"While the quality is decent I dont see why they just dont release this as a complet box set in the order these movies came out.1. The Egg and I (1947)2. Feudin', Fussin' and A-Fightin' (1948)3. Ma and Pa Kettle (1949)aka ""The Further Adventures of Ma and Pa Kettle""4. Ma and Pa Kettle Go to Town (1950)5. Ma and Pa Kettle Back on the Farm (1951)6. Ma and Pa Kettle at the Fair (1952)aka ""Ma and Pa Kettle at the County Fair""7. Ma and Pa Kettle on Vacation (1953)aka ""Ma and Pa Kettle Go to Paris""aka ""Ma and Pa Kettle Hit the Road""8. Ma and Pa Kettle at Home (1954)9. Ma and Pa Kettle at Waikiki (1955)10.The Kettles in The Ozarks (1956)(Without Percy Kilbride, Arthur Hunnicutt as Pa's brother - Sedge Kettle)11. The Kettles on Old MacDonald's Farm (1957)(Without Percy Kilbride)Now if they released it like this I would be happy, as it is now it is a far cry from being a good set."
1,Ma and Pa Kettle Collection,"I was very disappointed with this product. The disc would not play on ""The Egg and I"". I am going to return it."
5,Great fun,See my other review about the Ma & Pa Kettle dvd movies.I totally enjoyed it and so did my grandkids.
1,"Good Movies, Bad DVD","I wanted to see these movies so bad that I ignored the bad reviews.Of course the movies are wonderful but the disc copy quality is terrible.I am on my second disc and have seen scenes of The Egg and I that I missed on the first disc because of the ""freezing"". It's a crying shame to buy movies then not be able to enjoy them because of poor quality copying.If you don't mind the pauses and missing some of the scenes, these movies are very entertaining."
5,A Million Belly Laughs,Anyone who remembers the era of Ma & Pa Kettle really should add this wonderful selection to their video library. Never a dull moment and full of genuine laughs. I rate this Video a three thumbs up Triple A. Well worth the money.
4,DR KATZ IS GREAT,THE DVDS CAME TO ME AS PROMISED IN MINT CONDITION . DR KATZ IS AN AWESOME ANIMATED SHOW . I WISH IT WAS STILL ON .
4,Squigglevision finding it's vision,"There are only six episodes in season one. That sounds puny,until you find out how they were made. This was no big studio effort. The comedians featured are Ray Romano, Joy Behar,Dom Irrera, Dave Attel and Larry Miller. Some of this worksand some of it doesn't. Jonathan Katz is always funny along withhis son Ben(Jon Benjimin), and his bored secretary(Laura Silverman). Ray Romano is good. Some of the other comics arespotty. The commentary by the creators(Tom Snyder, Katz and Benjimin)is what makes this especially interesting(it would be a threestar without it) Filmed in squigglevision, which gives theillusion of movement, when actually only the lips and eyes move.They talk about how some people got ill watching squigglevision. I enjoyedthe show when it first ran, but watching no more than one or twoepisodes at a time is enough. I suppose they are waiting to see the response before issuing more on DVD. I hope they do, butmore episodes on the DVD please."
4,Extremely confortable and excellent sounding device,"Crips highs, clear voices and instruments, not overpowered lows, thats how I resume the sound performance of the very amazing HD 600. The only drawback for me is the pale esthetic of the cans, otherwise I would have given all 5 stars."
2,Best - and Worst -'Phones,"All these reviews are correct. These are the most comfortable headphones you'll ever wear. They have the cleanest, clearest sound. But the durability is a terrible problem! I have two pairs of 580's, and one has been back 3 times and the other 2 times. The problem is the jacks that connect the cable to the headphone eventually get loose, causing the earpieces to cut out. Both are now out of commission again. All the great sound and comfort in the world will do no good if they don't play... (5 stars for sound, 5 stars for comfort, and 0 stars for reliability)"
4,Great sounding cans,"As a New York recording a mixing engineer I've had the opportunity to listen to quite a few pairs of headphones. The Sennheiser HD600s are the clearest, fullest, and most balanced headphones I've heard so far. While they wouldn't work for a performer in the studio because of the open-air design and considerable leakage, they have become a must-have as a mixing reference, especially when mixing in a new and unfamiliar room.Grado makes some wonderful headphones that sound nearly as good as the HD600s but the up-against-the-ear design makes them uncomfortable after less than 15 minutes, whereas the HD600s, even with their snug fit, are still very comfortable for long periods of time.If you know of a better pair of headphones, I want to know about them!"
5,Great Product!!!!!!!,I bought It for my husband to use to play games on the computer he says the sound is the best ever.
1,Not so....,"I'm disappointed with this cd. The narrator goes too fast in guiding you. He wants you to relax and visualize certain events or situations in detail. OK, I did it, but within a few seconds he continues with guideline. HEY!! I haven't even finished the first one... besides that, I'm supposed to be relax and take it slowly. He goes waaaaaaaaaay too fast for one to truly feel and absorb the past. Somehow you have to hurry and visualize and feel things to be in pace with the narrarator. - Which makes the whole process sucks! You then become hectic and having no relaxation for fear that you might loose track of what he is saying.Its a waste of money. I wished I could have returned the product."
2,scratchy cd,"this product was of very poor quality and I was very disappointed overall, would not purchase from this company again."
4,This is a great sounding headphone.,"It delivers very good full range of sound. Highs are very crispy and lows are very full and solid. Although I haven't compared it with others in the similar price range, it does sound a par above the headphones that are selling for around $100. One reservation that I have is: the cord is very thin and soft. I think one has to be very careful with the wires in order for this baby to last for long."
2,Not worth it...,There are other ways of getting the very basic information that is in this book. Save your money.
5,A definitive book on the sociology of hate,"Perry does a wonderful job of incorporating James Messerschmidt's theory of crime as ""doing gender"" to hate crimes, seeing them as ""doing difference"". Especially useful is her analysis of gay-bashing. ..."
3,too much reading!,"too specific for an overview of cognition.. too much to know, but thats wat my course asks!"
4,"Very good, but not definitive","While I think the Company of Saynte George has done a great job and certainly has pictured a good amount of their work, I do not recommend that those of ou reading this book take this as a definitive guide on how to be a medieval soldier or think that these photos are perfect; Embleton himself has said that some things in the book are just not right. While the book is very good, if you intend to do any reenactment of the time period, continue doing research for yourself and do not stop with this one book."
5,wille wow,this cd is great it does not have all the every day songs you may have heads but the song you hear are also not the same same you here on radio i was looking for the sone song for you its on this also one of my faces but was super happy with all the rest def get this cd
1,"No Expiration, no saftey seal!!!!!!!!!","I thought by law if not by a company's own prudence that a safety seal and expiration date should be placed on all cosmetic product. Well this product arrived with no safety seal and no expiration date. The packaging was all beat up. I don't know about you, but I don't trust any cosmetic coming from the internet with no safety seal. When's the last time you bought something from a drug store with no safety seal and risked using it"
5,Actually works,"I have been using this product for years. When I couldn't get it in drug stores, I discovered the ease of Amazon. My skin is smooth and dark spots have faded.. I do not use this in the winter as it can have a drying and peeling effect. In the winter I use a retinol creme. I strongly recommend this product."
3,"Great track selection and good mastering, very low quality manufacturing","I bought this box set new and factory sealed, and was surprised to discover that 2 of the 4 CD's had scratches on the printed sides, near the borders. In audio CD's, the thin metal layer containing the audio recording is located on the printed side of the disc, and any scratches on that surface will directly and irrecoverably damage the recording. So, the last track on each of the damaged CD's was unplayable.On the plus side, the selection of tracks is great and the mastering is well done, unlike most other Sony Music and affiliate labels usual ""loudness war"" releases."
5,One of the greatest smooth-jazz CD's ever. Period. A must!,"If you are familiar with Paul Hardcastle (""Rainforests"", circa 1984, ""19""), then you know his music. Paul basically is Jazzmasters. This CD is full of dance/smooth jazz tracks. A must buy"
2,Buy a studio album instead.,"I thought I liked Chicago. This DVD is almost enough to persuade me I don't really. Video quality is that of a tired VHS tape. Audio quality is better, but the performance is rather unpolished. Buy a studio album instead.This is doomed to be one of those purchases only ever played once."
1,it is what it is,"i was really excited at hearing a LIVE DVD of CHICAGO (the original line-up) was coming out and told as many people as possible. but that excitement was quickly dashed in the first few minutes of viewing. this is obviously (to me) a VHS-to-DVD product and a poor one at that. only a couple of hits are here and the rest are B-sides, at best. i think this product was meant to tease true Chicago fans who hunger for a DVD of the original line-up in concert. it's hard to imagine that the band, itself, had anything to do with this product. i cannot articulate how disappointing this dvd is!! if you have to have it DO NOT SPEND MORE THAN $5 FOR THIS DVD (including shipping)...even then, it's questionable that it's worth even that..."

2,Look Elsewhere,"Up until the last third of this book, I would have given it a ratng of ""5"". The descriptions were well crafted, the suspense was taut and plausible, and I liked the fragile chemistry that was developing between the heroine and the owner of the B&B. Unfortunately, a succession of coincidences and contrivances turned my earlier evaluation into a ""1"". At the end of the day, there seemed to have been little rationale for all of the scandalous subterfuge that took place. I'll probably give this author another try but my spidey senses are already cautioning me not to get my hopes up, especially if it's another mystery."
4,Good book on observational x-ray astronomy,"This is an excellent book on x-ray astronomy. The author, a working scientist in the field, explains how x-ray astronomy slowly matured through the many satellites developed. The author took great care in explaining the details of the science and egineering of the various x-ray probes and the many intricacies of the x-ray astronomy itself. He slowly takes the reader to the depths of spectroscopy and then to the mysteries of the universre, stars and satr clouds. I enjoyed the reading."
3,no revelation,The books discusses interesting concepts but only touches on them and not reveals any major secrets of life. Quite disappointing after reading many books on the subject.
4,GARBAGE IS BACK!!,"It's been 4 loooonnnnnggg years since their abysmal ""beautifulgarbage"", keeping fans in suspense of what is gonna become of the band. The answer: retro-garbage. The band steers away from the electronica they've been dabbling in and head back to the raw sound of their debut album (one of my personal top 10 best albums ever). Key songs include current single, ""Why Do You Love Me?"", ""Bleed Like Me"", ""Metal Heart"", ""Boys Wanna Fight"", Bad Boyfriend"", and my favorite ""Sex Is Not the Enemy."" Glad to see them rockin again!"
4,Slow shipping - Does not fit Sony Memory sticks pro duo models,This case does not fit sony memory pro duo model memory cards which was the reason I purchased.
5,Impressive...,"I never thought I'd ever refer to panties as ""impressive,"" but these are. They are soft, breathable, light and super cute. You can even get the next size down, they will fit great.This is my first time trying boy shorts. I usually don't like them because I've had a C-section and they tend to fall right where my surgery line is and it is very uncomfortable. These are not ""grandma underwear"" even if they are not too low. They do not roll up my thigh. Because they do not have elastic around the leg opening, you will not see the panty lines through your clothes.Since then, I've replaced most of my panties with these. They are fantastic and definitely worth every penny."
3,Sams Teach Yourself UNIX System Administration in 21 Days,"This book has cons and pros. The style, the idea, the way how material is grouped is good. But SunOS 4.1.4 is obviously outdated. The author installes it to an old crapy Sparc with 500MB hard drive? I bought this book to use with Solaris 7 and returned it to the store. Everything is different. And the last. There are many places in the text that need better explanations. For example, how to share files: the sequence of actions? It looks that it is all in the text, but when you try to do it you realize that definitely you are missing smth."
4,Rediscovered a favorite band,I've been trying to complete my collection of music from my childhood so this fit right in. I wish the price was lowerl
5,Fantastic,This is a great album (oops CD) The extended versions of the songs are the best I have ever heard. Highly reccomend this even to everyone. A must have!
2,Too Much Reverberation,"The problem I have with this recording is the inordinate amount of reverb (echo). It sounds like it was recorded in a very large room (church?) with the room microphones only. It creates beautiful sonorities during slow passages, but unfortunately tends to blur faster passages to the point of rendering the performance unlistenable. It also takes away most of the attack and bow rasp which are an integral part of a performance. Part of me wonders if this wasn't done purposefully to attract a more, uh, ""new age"" crowd looking for some nice background music. Because as forefront music to actually listen to it grates the nerves after awhile and does not bear repeated listening."
4,Good collection for young children,"Most young children between 5-9 like pop music. Today's videos are too provocative, so my son doesn't get to see them. (I think they are for older kids anyway) The radio disney series offers many good pop songs that are not offensive. I highly recommend the whole series for this age group."
2,Not as fun as the first two Kids Jams,"My kids (6 & 9) love the Kids Jams 1 & 2, as well as La Vida Mickey. Part of what makes these collections fun is that they are a good mix of pop music & silly kid songs. The Vol. 3 is lacking in the ""silly kid songs"". It's predominantly pop songs and a little less appropriate mix than the previous CD's. The upside is that this CD contains the beloved ""Hampster Dance"". If you haven't bought any of the Kids Jams CD's, I would start with one of the first two, not this one."

1,Too small for everything.,"It's too small for real cooking job. And not fit well with its own pot as it mentioned. It'd not be rated, because I never used it again."
4,The one feature that I believe makes it ...,"The one feature that I believe makes it just a little better than all the other lotions available is the fact it contains ALOE!!! I have dry skin as it is, and after a day in the yard and a hot shower, this lotion was wonderful for replenishing the much-needed moisture to my skin. One of my very few criticisms, though, is that a little goes a long way; it comes out of the bottle too quickly. I'd suggest making it a little thicker."
3,Broke Quickly,"The headset was very comfortable to wear and the sound was excellent. However, there's a very weak joint between the two sides of the headset. The joint makes it foldable, but also very fragile. Mine snapped after just a few months of use. It's not covered by warranty so GE won't replace it."
4,Backpack fun,"We purchased this explorer backpack for our grandson who turned 4 while on a trip with us to the Great Smoky Mtns. He absolutely loved this gift and was thrilled to be able to use his own binoculars. He carried all of the items with him everywhere we went and felt just like the ""big"" kids."
1,Right Wing Lies,"When will the Republicans ever get over the fact that Clinton was a brilliant, effective president who stod above partisan politics to support middle-of-the-road initiatives in order to improve our country?I believe I read this with an open mind--but it's so full of parrtisan drivel and outright lies, that it is an embarrassment to its author.Don't waste your time on this one."
3,Not Yet...,"Having not read this book yet, but planning on doing so (too late right now), I'd like to just add one little comment about all the reviews - In every substantial review with less than two stars, I can expect to see the words ""Bush"" or ""Rush Limbaugh,"" with the exception of Mr. Barton's review, which I found helpful. With this element in mind, this book should be good if you do not have a deep distain for the Republican party, and even better if you are central."
2,is objectivity sometimes a goal in books about politics?,this is a real work to explain that all good aspects of clinton years cannot be credited to the president and that all of the dark side of this period and the bush years are the fault of clinton. is there something interesting in such a book? the author could have written a book which explains that dot com crash and 9/11 is because of bush it would not have been more or less interesting: just stupid.
3,Bush Legacy - Lowry's next Book?,"I'm sure Lowry has some good points. Clinton was not any saint.Be that as it may - the premise of this book is a joke, when you realize it is another attempt at a pre-emptive assault on the ""left.""The book that should be written, and now doubt will, in various forms, will be - the same title, only with ""Bush"" inserted.Compare America now, after Bush, compared to 2000, after Clinton. Case closed. Now how long will it take to recover from the nightmare of Bush and his policies...if ever...Very clever of righties like Lowry to somehow have the knack to anticipate what wind is coming, and pre-emptively go on the attack, in kind."
2,I question a lot,Based on the fact that the author doesn't seem to understand the difference between removal from office and impeachment - after so much media attention was drawn to the fact that they are 2 different issues- I have a lot of doubt in his assertions and his ability to place things into the proper subtext.
5,Great Color!,Love the color. I bought two because it(s a popular color at the nail salon I go to. I always get compliments on my toes when I wear wear it. Thanks OPI.
1,Doesn't fit,"Although the promotional material and the box the item came in all say this Quick Release mount will work with ANY Riptide bowmount trolling motor, it simply did not fit with the motor (SP) I bought at the same time. The holes in the part that is supposed to marry up with the trolling motor do not match with the holes in the motor itself. I had to mount the motor directly on the boat and cannot easily remove it for storage, security, or servicing. I returned the bracket mount to Amazon."
5,Out of body experience.,"Please Save My Earth is a gem of an anime flick but what really makes this a great series it's the inspiring music that accompanies this story. This album is just one of the many audio takes that came from this series. I truly love this one, from all the previous ones out there. The instrumentals are to die for and are simply mesmerizing. The kind of melodies that are just pleasing to zone out to. Sad and wrenching at times, the music will definitely take you away...to the moon, and beyond."
4,Spin Review (August 2003),"Whether they're whoopin' and hollerin' the disenfrachisement blues (""Cheater"") or decrying the police state (""A Man in Uniform""), Randy put a fine political point on Swedish garage rock. But it's not the government that's let them down: Album highlight ""X-Ray Eyes"" is an almost-emo take on Mom and Dad's disintegrating marriage.B+"
4,Sturdy cable as advertised,"There's not much to this cable other than it hooks up fairly easily as any other cable does. The bends in the cable tend to be a little tough to get out but that's expected with any cable. The twisty ends can hurt your fingers if they're stuck on tight onto a TV or otherwise, but nothing out of the ordinary. Fast shipping and great service."
2,Memory chip storage,"Not really very useful---A bit of overkill. While this case adequately protects the mem chips, it occupies considerable room with all the padding, etc. The individual plastic cases usually furnished with the chips are entirely satisfactory."
4,Bought for my 10 year old,"She says it was a really fun game and she likes how the dogs look, but when she went to visit the kennel sometimes you had to get a new dog and start all over. Once when she was walking the dog, she stopped by the kennel and had to get a different dog even tho she wanted to keep the one she had."
4,good muisque,If you like French rap you better get to cd is cracking from the 1st song to the last one. Better than commercial rap you hear on radio or see on tv
3,Not Universal,"This steamer isn't compatible with the Tri-Ply stainless steel set. According to Calphalon, it is only compatible with Calphalon One and the older professional and commercial sets. You have to get the universal steamer insert with lid instead (which is more expensive, unfortunately). The website doesn't display compatibility information well, and I told the customer service rep that their website should display this information."
3,Could be worse...,"There's no use pretending this is a great show score, but it's not unpleasant, and when Nanette Fabray gets a song between her teeth, things perk up considerably. Irving Berlin's melodies are likable, but some of the lyrics are stultifyingly prosaic (""Meat and Potatoes, Fried Eggs and Ham. That's the kinda' guy I am. Meat and Potatoes, Blueberry Pie. That's the kinda' guy am I""). Don't say you haven't been warned! Considering how awful an idea for a musical this was, though, the score could have been a lot worse. I'm glad I have it in my collection."
2,A Bit Of A Letdown,"I have many reasons to want to give this book a positive review. Charles is a highly acclaimed poet. He's a Serbian, sharing my ethnic background. I read an interview with him recently, and he seems like a highly engaging and funny guy. Everyone seems to be loving this book, the reviews are all 4 or 5 stars. That said, I just couldn't connect with more than one or two poems in this collection. Maybe I just don't understand Simic's style, but I found that this book didn't hold my interest. I am not giving up on Simic yet, I will try another one of his books."
4,Review for Super Food for Super Athletes,"Good , simple book on eating for the Athlete. Written in 1968 good information. leans towards vegetarian lifestyle but writer was open minded and had some interesting advise regarding health full eating. Recipes included are simple but practical a good beginning book for an active person."
4,"Every winter, my daughter and husband suffer from ...","Every winter, my daughter and husband suffer from severely dry skin. We have tried every lotion and cream on the market, but nothing has ever helped. This lotion was better than most that we've tried. My husband was pleased that some of his dry patches improved greatly. My daughter has sensitive skin -- perfumes bother her, so this unscented lotion was good for her as well. Overall, the product was very good, easily absorbed. and more effective than what we've used in the past. I would recommend this to others with dry or sensitive skin."
4,"Nuwine, You Are The Man!","The tracks are bangin', the lyrics are hard-hitting, and the bass is wall-vibrating. Nuwine has created another great cd. I've been a Nuwine fan ever since I heard his first album ""Da Bloody 5th, and I must say that this is cd is tight! But, unfortunately, I have one problem with the album: it has too many tracks that he doesn't rap on, and there is only 12 tracks. That's the only reason I give ""1998"" 4 stars instead of 5. But the tracks he does rap on rock. This cd isn't the same quality as ""Da Bloody 5th or ""When Thugs Fly"", but it still is better than most cd's that come out today. The best tracks are, without a doubt, ""One Million Souls"", ""Dead Serious"", and ""Wake Up and Die"". Nuwine, keep doing what you're doing. You rock. And rap fans, despite the couple of tracks that don't feature his unique rap style, it still rocks. You need this cd!"
5,tha best i've heard since raskull,this album is tight all tha way and his way of using screw is tha lick. i hope his next lp uses more screw. keep it comin nuwine
1,No big deal,"It is a nice looking video splitter, nothing more. At least I did not notice any improvement in signal quality when using this AR product. So, it's not clear what the ""high performance"" in this product means. Less noise perhaps or less signal degradation. Compared to my previous ""ordinary"" splitter, the signal looks fairly the same. So, no big deal!"
5,satisfied,i was familiar with the product before I ordered it. It was sent in due time and it was packed well. I am totally satisfied.
2,Not so pleasant smell,"This product seems to be doing its job, my skin is soft and smooth and feels great!However the downside would be the smell of this product. It's not horrible... just unpleasant. The offensive odor doesn't linger overly long, it's mostly gone within 15-30 minutes, but it really takes away from the enjoyment of this product.I also purchased the Alpha Hydrox Night Replenishing Cream, which has almost no odor at all."
3,"Makes skin smooth,but can cause break outs","This product is great for wrinkles,but beware if you have acne prone skin.My face broke out bad from this product.I thought maybe if I kept using it,it would eventually get better,but it did not.As soon as I stopped using it,my face cleared again.I wouldn't say it's greasy,but it does feel like it leaves a film over your skin.I still use it,but only in areas in which it isn't likely to cause breakouts, such as underneath my eyes.I will say that it does make your face feel very smooth and seems to help with fine lines."
3,Not thick enough,"I have dry skin and need to use a thick, heavy cream. I found this to be too runnyfor my skin type. It does absorb quickly."
1,TV RECEPTION POOR,"I AGREE WITH THE INDIVIDUAL WHO STATED THE RECEPTION IS EXTREMELY POOR. I HAVE BEEN ALL OVER THE COUNTRY TRYING TO FIND AN ANTENNA THAT WILL FIT THIS SYSTEM....WITH NO LUCK. I HAVE ALSO CALLED, AND CALLED MEMOREX DIRECTLY AND FOUND THEM TO BE OF NO HELP. SINCE I'M NOT A VENDOR, THEY WILL NOT HELP ME OBTAIN ONE. I ALSO FOUND OUT THAT THEY NO LONGER SELL THE ANTENNA THAT WAS MADE FOR THIS UNIT!!! THIS IS HORRIBLE CUSTOMER TREATMENT AND I WILL NEVER DEAL WITH MEMOREX AGAIN. CUSTOMER SATISFACTION MUST NOT BE A PRIORITY AT MEMOREX!!"
2,NOT WORTH A GRAMMY!,"This is one of the worst CD's I have ever purchased in my life! How could forty percent of these artists even win a Grammy? Half of these artists are not even on the radio or heard anywhere. Track 1- ""Say My Name"" by Destiny's Child- AN AWESOME SONG! Track 2- ""I Try"" by Macy Gray- HORRIBLE, MISERABLE SONG! Track 3- ""Music"" by Madonna- It's great, another winner! Track 4- ""Bye, Bye, Bye"" by N'Sync- I love it! Track 5- ""Beautiful Day"" by U2- another winner. Track 6- ""Beck"" by Sexx Laws- Garbage, who the heck are these people? Track 7- ""Slim Shady"" by Eminem- Not bad, but not great Track 8- ""Optimistic"" by Radioheard- Pure junk! Track 9- ""You're The One"" by Paul Simon- He's From The 70's! Track 10- ""Cousin Dupree"" bye Steely Dan- Who is that? Track 11- "" What a Girl Wants"" by Aguilera- Fabulous Track 12, 13- I can't stand these songs. Tracks 14-17- Good songsOverall it's about fifty percent good and fifty percent horrible. Not worth the money!"
3,An average cd,Well I was very disappointed with this cd. I figured since it was Grammy Nominees it would have some really good songs on it. It does but why did they have to seperate the rap and the latin music. i think that they needed to make a mix of all kinds of music not just one kind. I enjoyed some of the tracks but I wish they would have picked some of the artists better songs and not remixes of them. This cd gets an AVERAGE recommendation.
4,Pretty good.....,"I like ""Say My Name,"" ""Music,"" ""Bye Bye Bye,"" ""Beautiful Day,"" ""Sexx Laws,"" ""The Real Slim Shady,"" ""What A Girl Wants,"" and I sort of like ""Oops!...I Did It Again."" Be warned-a LOT of this is rock and pop, so if you're not a big fan of either, you will not like this CD. I have to agree with the fact that some of the songs on here were not hits-and some of them aren't good, either. ^^; By the way....I think people should stop being so friggin concerned about foul language and be more concerned about lyrical content in songs. I'd prefer they leave both alone, but I find it comical that they allow Eminem to talk about Tom Green humping a moose and 'jerking because this whole bag of Viagra isn't working' and *ahem* what Christina Aguilera 'did to him' backstage and yet heaven forbid we hear him say the word s***. Kinda ironic."
4,Good stuff! I like this headset.,The portable microphone is so convenient that it worth of two headsets. I am satisfied.
4,It will clear your doubts,"You will not be able to stop reading this once you have it. well writen and excenlenty translated. an good choice to be started with, in the dj culture. if you've ever asked yourself how, when, where or why something had happen in the dj's world, this the book you've been looking are looking for to answer those questions. the book is very complete and generous in information, but the only bad thing is that it only reached to the year 1996."
5,"beautiful speakers, great price...","The Wharfedale 7.2 is an incredible loudspeaker. I've listened to everything from Sibelius to Sarah Vaughan to David Bowie on them, and it all sounded crystal clear. These speakers have a warm, very natural sound and the soundstage is very believable. The bass response is incredible for such a small woofer. My father owns Quad and Dahlquist speakers and isn't impressed by much less than excellence, but when I hooked the Whafedale's up to his Nakamichi he liked them so much he's now considering buying a pair. My only nit-picky complaint is that the midrange could be a bit brighter. However, these speakers do handle the treble and bass beautifully, even the high trebles and (especially) the lower bass end. Room positioning is crucial for these speakers to sound their best. If you have any doubts about purchasing a pair, forget about them. This incredible speaker will not disappoint you, and at [the] price...you'd be insane not to buy them."
3,A little runny,"I bought this based on all of the positive reviews. When first applying this ""cream,"" you immediately notice how runny it is. It's pretty much a liquid, not really what I was expecting. Overall, the product does a fairly decent job of moisturizing my face, however I can't help to wonder if a thicker formula would be more effective."
4,Nice Moisturizer,"I have very sensitive, combination skin that is also prone to breakouts. I purchased this moisturizer a few weeks ago and so far I am satisfied. Complex 15 provides even coverage, doesn't cause breakouts, and doesn't have a strong odor. It isn't completely effective in combating my dry, winter skin, but I expect it to be a great moisturizer for the warmer months."
2,good moisture but...,"While this is a good moisturizer, it did not help my rosacea. If you have acne rosacea then this is so so if your skin is anything like mine."
1,BAD QUALITY,"I'm really dissapointed with this guitar. I just bought it and after 3 days of being tuned the bridge cracked completely. Sound was nice but for using the guitar only during 3 days, it's non acceptable. I made sure that string were not overstressed and tuned with electronic tuner having just the top 3 sets of strings (D,A,E) tuned an octave apart (The G was tuned in the same octave) to avoid stress on the guitar. But even with that, the bridge cracked. The wood on the bridge is not rosewood but a low quality wood, that was the cause of the damage."
4,Brown Eyed Girl,Mariah Stewart is one of my choice author. I enjoyed the story line of this book. It is well written and easy to follow.
4,Thrilling,"Leah's younger sister Melissa has been missing for years. One day Leah receives a note from a prisoner on death row, who claims he knows were the body of her sister can be found. Before she can find out more, the killer is killed himself. The story is a fast read. The only thing that bothered me was that I realized who the ""baddie"" was quite early in the story. But that is maybe because I have read so many of these kind of novels, that I can see the early signs. I would recommend this book to all lovers of a romance with a thrill to it."
5,Everyone that hears this disk loves it.,"I orginlly bought it for ""last plane out"" which got some airplay. I quickly realized that I liked every track. One of the most rewarding things about the internet is that I have found that im not alone, and have found other great Kevin Gilbert CD's. I will consider the fact that I will never see a live show a great tragedy."
1,Ultimate Mahjongg 20,I downloaded this into my computer and tried to play some of the games. I might have had a bad disc. It froze up on me and I had to shut down my compute and then I tried again and the same thing happened. So I was not able toplay the games. I had to un install the game and I returned it.
1,Does not work on a Mac,Be careful with what you buy. I was searching under mac games and this one came up. It does not work with a Mac.
4,"Starts Out Good, But...","I was excited when I first started playing this game because I thought it would be very interesting. It is very accurate when it comes to diagnosing pets and giving them the proper medication. However, I have found it to become kind of boring after a few days of playing it. This is merely because of the one thing that annoys me most: BUGS.How do you unlock the fields + meadows and the beachs and stuff? Does anyone know? Is it impossible? I really need to know how to unlock them because it is driving me crazy. If anyone knows how to unlock them, or if Valusoft has made some sort of fixer-upper patch, PLEASE write a review and inform us all! We are in dire need here!"
1,"Too hard for Kids, What's the age anyhow?","I bought this game for my 6 1/2 year old daughter, and it is way too hard for her. The game expects players to know the meaning of words like antibiotics, imunization, and salve. The players are also suposed to be diagnosticians and know the propper treatments for animals with aflictions such as lice and ring worm. What child knows how to do that? My daughter just kept trying to give the pets vacines and buy a horse and she got no where. No where on the box is the appropriate age specified. I would not recomend this for any child under 13."
4,Good subwoofer but it's amp is only 75!,All Wharfedale amps that are listed on here have incorrect information as far as amp power! The amp power on this unit is 75. You would have to get the SW-12 or SW-18 for amp power of 150. This is a great subwoofer but it's very big!
2,It simply hums.,I bought this system to go with my JVC 400 watt surround. As soon as I connected it it began to hum. I thought maybe it was my JVC so I reconnected it to another RCA system I owned and it did the same thing. The sound is great at high volume but has the annoying hum at low volume and the sub drops out at low volume. I returned unit for a refund.
4,Good but there are white fiber fillers,"It is somewhat difficult to strip the plastic from the wires, even with my stripping tool, and there are what appear to be white ""filler"" fibers. However, this is a good price for this length oxygen-free speaker wire. They sound fine, but I ended up not using it - the speakers I bought locally did not work out."
2,Great when it works,"VERY fast, but it gets so hot it will melt the wires together in the switch box. i have had this happen several times. It will shut off before I can get all 4 tires re-inflated; 35"" MTR's from 8psi to 26psi."
2,This is functional but junk,"Quality control on this is poor. Mine arrived from Amazon with a leaky connector and a mounting screw for the unit that was half out. I'm hoping I can fix the leak. I got a discount on the unit and paid about $100, so my opinion is that it's only moderately overpriced for the quality."
2,not satisfied,I've owned the camera two years and it's needed repair twice. The camera must be sent off and takes about six weeks to two months for return. It is now needing repair once more ... also it is difficult to see images in bright sunlight.
3,worth a try,"I got this to help with my dog's obsessive compulsive behaviors. It didn't work miracles as I had hoped but it did calm him a bit. It came highly recommended by my vet for separation anxiety though, and I have heard it works well with many dogs."
5,"Thank you for transporting me to ""The Neighborhood.""","I spent the weekend reading this book, and was thoroughly entertained. It is an intriguing tale with fascinating characters of every sort. I particularly enjoyed the relationship the main character had with his female friend, BeBop. She and Jack confided in and protected each other while trying to ignore the sexual tension between them.This is a realistic look at growing up in Little Italy, and about the difficult choices a boy makes when becoming a man."
1,Who won?,"I don't recall any surrender documents being signed by the United States. If memory servers me correctly, there was the Paris Peace Accords that were signed and subsequently violated by the North Vietnamese who invaded the South after the U.S. had left."
4,Solid Piece / do the work (hub),Metal hard casing with quality sturcture.Do the tricks fine. Some static sounds with more than 2 sources pluged in tho. You will need alot of different cables and converters.
2,"Ok, but not exactly what I wanted","Product design was fair. I like the option of USB or AC Adaptor (included) power. I thought I was getting a black one, but received a white unit instead. Biggest issue was that the design of the sound output allowed for only a very narrow mini jack. Although one was included, I couldn't use a higher quality aftermarket mini to RCA output. It would be OK for desktop use, but I'd be afraid that the thin wires would fail after extended use. I returned the product and Amazon was great with the return."
3,"Pinyin, please.","The pen works great for scanning Chinese characters to get the English translation and vis-versa. However, my big BIG complaint is that there is no Pinyin given for the translation. If Alestron Inc. would be so kind as to make an add-on Pinyin dictionary, that would be wonderful. Secondly, the pen will not read outdoors when the sun is out, it is very sensitive to excessive lighting. The pen does come with several to-English dictionaries, such as French, Spanish, Korean, Japanese, ect. So that is good. I had trouble getting the included software to translate correctly. The only way I can get it to show the characters is to save my translated file as html and load it in IE using HZ encoding."
1,Shouldn't advertisement material be free?,For one of the leading company in thin-client programming with Java this is a really bad book. The only thing that is described good enough are the IBM products. This book was a real waste of a lot of money!
1,MP3131 - CD player did not work,"We bought this for our daughter this Christmas. She put a new CD in the unit, and it played for about 15 seconds, then died. We could not move to other tracks on the CD, and other CDs showed the same result. We were able to return it to the store for a refund, and have not been able to find the same unit since anywhere."
5,Essential !,It is not a reference book but it will help you understanding the core tools in DSP....great book!
5,A fun way to learn in the tub,"Not only does each boat have a shape on its sail, the same shape is on the base of its sail post and in the deck of the boat. For example, the star-shaped post of the orange boat will only fit into the star-shaped hole on the orange boat's deck. It's a fun way to practice fine motor skills as well as learning shapes and colors."
3,For experts only,"The author's preface says, ""A strong background in relational databases and the C++ programming language would be a prerequisite for the reader."" Well, I have a strong background in C++, but not in relational databases, and I got almost nothing out of this book. I suggest that this book is best suited for readers strong in relational databases, and maybe for those currently working with object oriented databases."
4,I liked that it had less suds than ...,I liked that it had less suds than soap. It's an all right product. I might or might not recommend it to a friend. My skin is real touchy and I'm not sure its working.
2,okay,"I have two sisters, and we all use this product.They used it before me, and they still had such bad acne that i was afraid to use it!Well, it didn't help at all!I switched to olay face pads or whatever.They are a lot better!Now i'm zit free!"
3,Not sure how i feel about it.,"I know it's for sensitive skin, so it's not a harsh cleaner, but I dont like how it leaves my face still feeling oily."
2,CD items missing. Lowers book value substantially,"The book is tightly integrated with the CD exercises that are missing. Her dreamweaver book had similar issues also (poor editing). For an author that prides herself with 'organization' and being a perfectionist (her words not mine), this should be an embarrassment. I do like her writing though, maybe because she is writing something somewhat technical yet doesn't put me to sleep. My learning experience has been deminished substantually by not being able to complete the excercises."
4,Aretha has left the building,"Aretha Franklin has always had a knack for taking an already existing, beautiful song and totally re-inventing it with her brilliant arangements. She brings a personal and warm feel to all the songs she covers (see Eleanor Rigby or Bridge Over Troubled Water), making them her own. Not to mention her own original songs (Dr.Feelgood ""Don't we all need a visit from you sometimes"", And the breath-taking Spirits In The Dark). Truely one of the greatest live albums of the early seventies 'Fillmore' series. Ray Charles guest-appears (God I wish I had been there) and just tears the roof down. And what about the cover of the album, I have always loved the cover, a mature Aretha looking very motherly and angelic. Aretha had definately arrived."
1,Made in China,"I thought Smokehouse products were always from the USA - that is why I ordered these. Much to my surprise, these were made in China. Not only that but they contain wheat flour. I am returning them. I wish I had read the reviews before I purchased, I see another review mentioned that these were made in China. I guess Smokehouse doesn't keep the quality as consistently high as I thought."
5,Broadway Classics The Way They Should Be Sung!,"This CD is a wonderful addition to anyone's library of Broadway Music sung by a rising star in the Broadway Theater genre. Lisa vroman sang Christine in ""Phantom of the Opera"" in San Francisco for it's entire run of five years. She sings not only Broadway music but classical music having appeared with a number of Orchestras around the country. Tonite(Jan. 29th) she is singing with the Detroit Symphony and recently appeared with the West Coast Symphony in Florida. Her repertoire is wide spread as witnessed by this album. The orchestra on the recording is mainly San Francisco Symphony players and a number of the arrangements are done by Brad Carroll, a friend of Lisa's for many years. This CD should not be missed. It is new and terrific!"
1,Poor FM reception and sound,"I told Amazon not to offer this product any longer. Not one FM station came in without a lot of static. This is from the same room a ... panasonic cheapo radio works fine. If I put it on mono and held the antenna in just the right position I could get a radio station in. Even then, the sound quality was very poor and the simulated surround botton increased the static more. I didn't even bother trying the cd or tape deck. Don't buy this product. I had it out of the box 10 minutes and now it's on its way back."
1,Doesn't Work,"After reading wonderful reviews, I bought this product right away. I have been using this product for two weeks now and I am getting acne all around my skin. I wear light makeup to hide my scars but this product leaves my skin oily and makes my makeup messy. I also have to wash my face couple of times to completely remove my makeup. I used to love dove face cleanser but it has been discontinued but dove soap helped a lot too and I would get very little acne. Proactive helped too but it's far too expensive."
4,good enough for the price,"I've purchased this product falling for the ""Alpha hydrox"" name thinking that there is AHA in it for gentle resurfacing. And I was dissapointed to see only Citric acid in it out of all array of AHAs. Unfortunately I didn't notice all the ingredients listed. Oh well. It's a good cleanser, foams up well and takes off all the makeup. I just wish it didn't have Parabens and Urea. I am not too fond of those."
3,Good cleanser,"As a part of the daily routine, this is a good option if you have an oily or combination skin type."
3,Good Face Wash,Obviously not a miracle product or anything but does the job. Does not over dry the skin and leaves it clean. Would recommend to try.
3,NO AHAs in this product,"I usually read ingredient lists carefully, but I guess the name fulled me and I thought this product had some AHA's. After using it for a while and not seeing or feeling any difference (AHA's should sting a bit) I checked and sure enough, despite the name, no AHAs. I wanted a product with AHAs and think the company's name is deceiving on such a product. I thought they only sold products with AHAs. Perhaps they aren't doing this intentionally, but it is confusing and I wanted to let everyone know in case you were fooled too."
2,My face got acne because of it.,"I had been using this product for about 2 months. The first week I was impressed by how my face was smooth and cleaned. It didn't dry or irritated my skin at all.(I have sensitive and oily skin.) But after that my clear face started to have acne. Stupid me, I gave it a chance and continued using it, thinking it might be the weather or something I ate that harmed my face. One month later, my skin had more acne, and it is certainly caused by this product. Now I have to find a treatment for my acned face! Bad experience for me. So not recommend this!"
5,Great product...great results!,"This is an affordable solution to clogged pores and dull looking skin. I've had acne since I was a teenager and have gone through several treatments without any luck. I decided to give glycolic acid a try 2 months ago and I can already see the difference! My face and neck feel a lot smoother and pores are clearing little by little. This is not a magical potion and I understand it will take time for my skin to improve; but this is the first product that has reduced the incidence and length of breakouts. I do get them every now an then, but they only last for a day or two. This is the first time I post a review after many years buying at Amazon. This product is really worth a try!"
3,"Not a great value, but a good sub!","Over all, a very good sub, but keeping in mind its price tag, not a good value. It delivers good clean deep bass, expecially good at high volumes. It would definitely complete a high-end system. My problem is that for half the money, most people can get a sub that would fit nicely in a big room and deliver high-end quality sound. Not something to purchase without hearing first, but if the money is there, you will be happy."
4,good product,Good product used it before but would not pay the $97.00 go on the D&E website and the product is selling for under $15.00
3,Problems ...,"After extensive research, I selected the picturebook for its light wight and features (built in digital camera/video cam & the cd-rw/dvd player). While I love the size, the items on the screen are SO tiny. Second, the system seems really slow. Also, I had problems including this Windows XP onto my home network because Microsoft doesn't include the cd and you can't burn a network disk to a cd but only a memory stick, which I don't have. Even the network setup floppy from another machine doesn't work with my other computer that has Windows 2000. Finally, the cd player doesn't work, and Sony wants me to return the computer for repair. I think I am just going to return the system."
4,21 Jump Street - Season 2,"What a hottie! This is where my favourite actor in the world, Johnny Depp, got his major start (aside from Nightmare on Elm Street of course!) and he stars with the great Peter De Louise! Take the time to sit and watch the whole series - it starts off a little slow but gets better!"
2,Avoid,"_Mirdad_ is an attempt by Mikhael Naimy to imitate the kind of writing the Sufis did best: a little odd, but meaningful and rewarding on multiple levels. He fails. The best that can be said about this book is that it is a good insight into Naimy's mind, with half-baked anticapitalism, stupid comments on science, and smug self-satisfaction included. (Not that I'm against self-satisfied nonscientific anticapitalists, you understand, but I prefer it when they have a cogent position and can write well enough to express it).If you think you can read passages like 'Verily, Man is the darling of the Universe. All things are glad to pamper him' or 'All orders of being below Man are enclosed in group ova . . . always the more evolved enclosing all the orders of Life below it down to the central nucleus' and still think that the author is wiser than you, then go right ahead and get this book. Otherwise, steer clear, and try Idries Shah for a wiser, infinitely more satisfying dose of spirituality."
4,"An insightful look at the ""ghosts"" of San Juan mountains",Rick Bass gave us hope that these grizzlies are still out there in the San Juan mountains. The narrative gave us an insightful look into a place that grizzlies may safely be hidden away from man.
1,Did Not Work,I purchased this for my daughter whom has little tiny bumps on her arms. The doctor said there's nothing we can do about it and she is very embarrassed of them so I purchased this to try it. It did not work. It may work better for dry skin but not sure since we were only trying it for her bumps.
4,Good for general use but not for KP for me,"I bought this because people have said it worked to reduce their KP issue, but it didn't do anything for me. It certainly has made my skin softer but after a month or so of use I don't see the slightest bit of improvement. In fact, my KP which had spread to my forearm prior to using this product, became irritable and itchy when I use it. My KP on the forearm is actually swelling and itching, and turning very red so I have stopped use of it. It would be good for general use to moisturize and soften skin for most people, but it isn't good for my KP."
5,Recommended by the collecting community,"This book is the first I've bought on the M1 Garand. I purchased it on the recommendation of numerous people I know who are very involved in the hobby of collecting antique service weapons. I am currently using the book to help me get to know a 65 year old M1 that I recently acquired, and find it very informative and well put together. This book is known as one of the standards. Well worth buying."
3,Authors Know SMS well - needs to be redone for 1.2,"I felt the book's content reflected a deep and practical knowledge of SMS on the part of the authors. This book is actually a very good overall planning guide for SMS. Most third party references focus on operations and gloss over site planning issues - yet these are the most important if you are consulting. The book definintely needs an update for SMS 1.2 and the SMS Installer. Success in the SMS test hinges on having a very unpractical level of knowledge of all the complex and interlocking SMS configuration requirements - ""small"" differences between 1.1 and 1.2 could mean failing the test. This is still the most effective reference for the 1.2 test if you cross-reference it with other resources (product manuals and classroom materials)."
3,historically detailed but....,"John Parker's photographs in ""Francesco's Venice"" are lovely. However, the historical text written by Francesco Da Mosto, although complete and covering a vast time period, is opinionated, rather cumbersome and replete with self congratulatory statements concerning his family's Venetian heritage. I found the latter annoyingly childish; like a 6 year-old giving a class report wanting to make sure his classmates knew just how important his daddy was. This self importance as a true Venetian with a rich family history may have been the impetus for writing the book but adds nothing to it. In the final analysis, aside from the photographs I was not particularly pleased with my purchase."
5,Just what my husband was looking for!,"I purchased this for my husband and he loves this product. His skin was dry from the cold weather and he wanted something that would make it look moist but not leave a film, feel greasy or have a scent. He uses this on his face every day. Thanks."
3,"pretty good,but Kayne is a bit heavy-handed at times","I dig the James Bond theme Sample.it fits what Kayne West was trying to get at.Musically he has a bit too much going on.His Rap Flow is better here though at times he is still too preachy.right now He is still beter behind someone else as to being a Artist thus far.this song has a good message,but Kayne is still a bit too heavy handed."
2,"Classic tracks, but not mixed well","Many of the tracks on this compilation album are classics of the genre. Doc Scott, Digital, J-Majik, Optical... it's an incredible line up.But the mixing is terrible. I listened to unmixed versions of several of the songs. Turns out, Goldie ""overmixes"" -- the songs overlap to such a degree, that you can't get a good feel for each individual song.If you want a much better introduction to drum and bass, compiled by Goldie actually, check out Platinum Breakz volume one. There you don't have to deal with the absurd mixes.I really hate to do this, because Goldie made some great music (""Terminator"" is stunning) and his Platinum Breakz albums are excellent. But I think it's important to let people know that the poor mixing spoils otherwise flawless songs."
4,Francisco don't know nothin',"It was obvious to me upon researching this wonderful offering from Goldie that it is quality work to the fullest. What's up with that cat Francisco Javier giving Goldie 1 star? It's obvious he has never heard nor does he enjoy drum'n'bass. That's fine, but don't bad mouth a great record because you don't like the style. Obviously, his tastes lie more in the realm of people who are always on the cover of Rolling Stone, or folks who charge [money] to go to their show. This album is fresh. I could tell that just by seeing the artists Goldie selected and listening to the samples provided. There is a quality thread going with heads like Souljah, and Goldie himself. Don't listen to reviewers who are afraid of something new and don't even know the name of the genre they are checking out. ..."
3,good old-school ('97) d-n-b,"good cd. some lame tracks, but mainly hard-hitting stuff. too much chick singing in some tracks, though, and not nearly enough layering or complexity to others. i listen to this cd after i program out all the stuff i don't like, and the way it sounds skipping a few tracks at a time is about as good as his mixing skills."
1,never received the order,I have not received the order and I don't think I ever will.Not impressed I will not order from them again .
2,Wedding Coloring Book,"I was a little dissappointed when I received the coloring book. I wasn't expecting it to be tied so closely to another culture and thought it would be more ""wedding generic!"""
5,Collectors item,If you're a real proof fan this really is a must have. I haven't bought this for the music because I can't even play this lp because I simply don't have a lp player but it's just very nice to have. It's a nice green plaque with a very nice cover. It's not one to put in your closet along with your other lp's!
4,Shwinn Volare,"When the bike arrived the weather was terrible and it hasn't improved since then, so I haven't had a chance to ride it much. But it was easy to put together and I haven't had any problems as of yet. Because of the weather I haven't rode it too much but I have done a couple of half hour rides and I enjoyed them and didn't have any problems with bike. So I'm happy so far. Looks great so far."
5,This stuff actually works!!,I have had eczema for 20 years and used so many lotions and creams and changed my soaps and nothing ever worked.. Well finally was told to try this lotion out and in less than a month a gt major results.. My skin is always smooth and looks amazingly healthy.. I can't get enough of this..
3,Good for parents!,"I just finishing reading this book. It was a good read but it is more or less for parents to read. Don't get me wrong, I learned some things: what parents go through, some things on society, history of p-flag, and such but it was not all that I hoped this book would be.The author uses lots of high profile people as examples in this book so it was hard for someone like me to figure out just where I stand in life. As it will probably be for parents to place their child among these people who are exampled.Most of the themes in this book are more adult rather than young teens to young adult.It is a good attempt to give an overview of the ""gay"" world but it was not what I expected.I would recomend this book for parents of gay children who want to learn more about the life style, history, p-flag, ect.But not to learn about their children. The only way to do that is to ask them yourself."
3,Hardys in California.,"This book has plenty of fast-paced action, but it's just your standard Hardy Boys book, there's a murder and the Hardys are gonna find out who did it."
3,Adequate,"What can one say about a urinal? It has no leaks, and the lid closes. It might keep the liquid in if it fell on the side, but it certainly adequate for preventing sloshing when going to empty it."
2,"""Current"" is out of date!","For the time, 12 years ago, 'current' photos were only about 2 years out of date. Although the background and history don't change, I am replacing this one on library shelves in favor of Space by Heather Dakota, the updated Isaac Asmimov series, and small chapters in texts from 2002 and later. Theoretical astronomy is hard enough to keep updated without this stuff taking up shelf space. There is a huge price war on this as well, that I fail to understand. Anything from $0.01 to over $100.00?"
3,Consistent silly action fun go!,"Not a good introduction to the characters-- if you haven't seen Ranma 1/2 before, watch the first few TV episodes first. If you're familiar with the show, this is more of the same expected combination of humour & action. The DVD is great because it gives info on the characters (if you are new to the show) as well as the option for watching in Japanese or English.Our only real disappointment was not enough scenes with Genma (the Panda)."
4,"Great movie, but quality?",I like this movie a lot. But I wonder if they even took the time to clean up the picture quality? It looks like a straight transfer from VHS to DVD. But at least I have this movie in a nice DVD case so I'm happy with that.
5,it was asome,the movie is really good and really funny its nothing like seeing ranma in a dress and actually trying his hardest to be a girl lol you will love this movie
5,Exceptional book - A must read,"Simple and powerful book to realize yourself on the seven important topics (sex, worry, fear, jealousy, attention-need, ego and discontent). I followed up this book with a 2 day meditation program organized by the life bliss foundation and it was a fantastic experience.Highly recommended for your inner transformation. True to it's name this book privide you Guaranteed solutions."
3,The Toooo!!! Politcal Side,"The book was ok. I took it as a summer class, and there was too much information to be packed in this book. Some side issues were rather interesting, but I would not recommend it unless you are into political science. And I mean ""into it""."
4,ditto,Please see the review of the ladies version of these clubs. Everything stated there applies to the men's set.
5,An A + hit,The music is great and fun to listen to a definet Best seller in my opinion. should fly off the shelves in no time!
5,The Medical Explanation for Stretching,Learn the anatomy behind your muscles and why stretching is important. This book also includes several techniques for safe stretches.
1,NOISE.,"Engine Noise is awful. With this cable, the noise is even strong. Very dissapointing.Too bad for an rockford fosgate product.Tested in a Chevy Spark."
4,Great general knowledge....,I really enjoyed the information contained in this book. Though some of the details and information has changed due to new discoveries I still found the book to be very impressive.
1,"Not very funny, actually embarrassing to watch.","Both my wife & I are big fans of The Colbert Report so she gave me this for my birthday this year. We waited until the Christmas season was well underway and fired it up. To quote Kevin Kline in A Fish Called Wanda: DISAPPOINTED!!It is not funnny or witty/clever at all. We had friends over at the time, and the whole experience was rather embarrassing. They had heard us praise The Report in the past, and were kind of looking at us like: ""You guys think this type of sophomoric attempt at humor is funny, eh?""If fact, on this video, Stephen doesn't even sound like himself (compared to what we're used to on The Report). The whole thing struck us as rather forced and pathetic. Two thumbs emphatically down from us."
3,Dated,"Was better when it first came out. Now it is dated. Colbert is much funnier and polished, less slapstick, on TV now."
2,What a disappointment [but I'm an old guy],The Colbert Report is required viewing in our house. Maybe it is telling that the only other Comedy Central show I watch is Jon Stewart.My wife loves Colbert- and my daughter [22yrs old] had caught part of the special and said it was super. So I ordered 3 copies- one for our house and 2 for gifts.My daughter still thinks it was funny. My wife and I were very disappointed. The language and content of the previews of other Comedy Central shows before the special nixxed any possibility of giving the CD's as gifts. The show itself wasn't R rated- but it was nowhere near as funny as Colbert's 1/2 hour regular show.
1,Worst of Colbert,My family and I are huge fans of the Colbert Report. I purchased this for my mother and we all watched. We were flabbergasted at how horrible this show was. It was definitely not up to Colbert's usual standards.
3,Not what I expected,"This special is not what I or my son, a gift because he likes Colbert, expected. It has some very funny spots and the guests are cool, but overall the DVD is kind of dumb. We decided we would put it with the Christmas DVDs and watch it once a year for a reminder.If you like Stephen Colbert, you'll still think this is goofy and not all that cute or Christmasy..."
5,effective treatment for eczema,I have mild eczema and this cream (recommended by my doctor) works as well as any prescription cream I have tried.
5,Great product,Great Product. I have pretty dry skin and my dermatologist recommended it. It has really helped.
5,"One word, Fantastic!!","DML Facial Moisturizer, was highly recommended by my dermatologist, combined with his retina product at night.DML is a fantastic, creamy, soft daily Moisturizer. For natural glowing skin, the product is worth the money you spend.DML is not purchased in a fancy bottle, with a big box around it making the purchase look as though you purchasemore than you actually have, DML is what you see. A great facial moisturizer, packed in a simple box. I have used DML nowfor a few years and always have been very pleased with the purchase and the way your skin glows and feels.Each time I order, I purchase 5 or 6 bottles at a time, so I will not run out. Unfortunately, I can not find DML at local stores."
5,Will be re-ordering this Moisturizer,"I was on a quest for a facial moisturizer that didn't sting and this one doesn't. I was also looking for one that didn't have any anti-aging ingredients. This one is great; it's very moisturizing and is non-greasy and non-sticky. Just wish it came in a higher SPF, but for winter it'll be fine."
5,Talent and Depth,"Lee Sankey's talent is proven in this first album. Such depth and quality! Both his song writing and his musical talent are exciting and emotionally moving. I am so glad he's back in the game and producing again! I heard Lee first play for fun on the [...]. After ""proving himself"", he was asked to come up and play with the likes of Kim Wilson and Mark Hummel. Amazing talent. I have both of his albums now and I hope you like him too!Margie Way"
1,Nino Tempo & April Stevens,"I always liked the song ""Deep Purple"" but never heard any of Nino Tempo & April Stevens other songs, Very disapointed!!! Deep Purpe is the only song on the album that they sing on key, Or I'm tone deaf."
1,Don't believe the hype!!!!!,"I was so hoping this did what it promised. It didn't.It couldn't heat up enough to even melt the solder well. I tried the thinest gauge solder and it wouldn't melt unless you held the tip on it (which they don't suggest). The other option is to heat up the area you want to solder to rub the solder on it. The COld Heat couldn't warm up the smallest of areas. I tried it on a silver ring (silver solder should melt easier) didn't work at all. Tried it on a speaker wire to a speaker- didn;t work. Tried an xbox mod chip, didn't work.I am returning this fancy hunk of poop and getting a plug in that shows the actual rating on the box.The directions say it is only for small low heat uses. I can't see how they made the commercial without pure fraud."
1,deceptive!,"The ""free wire stripper-included"" is a form you get with the solderer to send back with a check for $5.99 for S&H ! That is certainly not free. There was enough room in the shipping box for 5 wire strippers. Amazon should drop this company if they use this type of false advertising."
4,updated review,"Originally, I received this product but the contents were not as shown on the Amazon page. However the supplier promptly contacted me to discuss my dissatifaction and resolved the matter expeditiously. Everyone is satisfied now with the outcome."
1,Its a TOY,I have to write this review because this item its a TOY. If you are looking for a toy soldering product then you can go ahead and buy this one. I bought this item because I wanted to be more flexible when I have to solder but this item its just terrible. I am an electronics technitian and I really have to say it again ....this is a TOY and a headache. No wonder why it works with regular batteries. You can try it but after you first take it in your hands you will remember my words....I don't even know why they permit them to sell it as anything else than a toy.
1,Cold Heat Soldering Iron Review,"Do not buy this useless item. I only gave a ""1"" rating because there was not a ""0"" rating available. I tried to solder a wire to a switch and noticed the tip of the cold heat iron started to wobble. I then inspected it to find that the PLASTIC?? insulation around the tip was melting. I then read the instructions to find that you aren't supposed to have the heat going for more than a few seconds at a time. Not sure how you can solder anything that quickly when the solder won't even start soaking into the wire for at least 30 seconds with this thing... I took mine back to RS and exchanged it for some stuff that wasn't as worthless. A possible use for this thing is soldering onto a printed circuit board."
1,I caution potential purchasers,I'm afraid that I have no confidence in this software. My entire subdivision is absent from map (we have occupied this home for 6 years) as is our nearby community hospital (which was there well before our subdivision). How could I ever trust this software to find my way around an unfamiliar area. I am very disappointed and the seller would not accept a return even for store credit.
5,Amazing and eye opening!!,"Awesome book. Invaluable to anyone wanting to learn more about their spirituality. Wealth of information that was truly eye opening and amazing. Couldn't turn the pages fast enough. Read the book and find the wonderful things there are for you in the world if you want them. Find your way to joy, peace, love, etc. Get everything God wants for you and that you want and need in your life. Amazing book truly. Thank you Michael."
2,Falls Flat,"I read this book after hearing that a movie studio bought the film rights to produce it, saying it was a mix between The Thing and Die Hard. Well, in theory, that's sounds like fun, but Stephen Laws did not pull it off. The mythology Laws tries to create is initially interesting, but eventually just becomes too silly.What started out very promising, fell flat halfway through the novel. I quickly became bored with the 150+ page chase scene up and down the stairwell and elevator. Horror is about atmosphere and suspense. This was more science fiction with a comic book villain awkwardly thrown in for danger. Disappointing."
3,Darkfall,"It's a horror story that initially grabs your attention and makes you wonder how it is going to turn out. Events are happening inside the building as well as other places. You add in a special group of people who seem to understand what's going on, but they are operating under some veil of secrecy that threatens the participants' lives. With all of this, you almost feel you got yourself a winner. However, the book's excitement dies around page 260 and the book has a 100 pages to go. I found myself struggling to finish it. I found myself no longer caring about the characters and I pretty much knew where it was going to go. I wouldn't say it's a waste of time, but if money is tight when it come to your book budget, you might want to look into other options."
3,A Choppy Sockey with a former James Bond,"A not too bad action film from the 70's with George Lazenby as a Aussie mob boss taken on by a karate/kung fu cop (Jimmy Wang YU) from Hong Kong. Lazenby's death is a classic moment to rank with Cagney's top of the world in White Heat. Too bad this isn't yet on region 1 DVD. Film's theme song (""Sky High"") was a modest hit on the top 40 charts."
4,"Great start, some other awesome tracks...","The first track just makes me close my eyes and feel right on a plane on the way to Ibiza for another fun summer vacation... The middle of the CD is strong, but not spectacular. Fun overall ;)"
5,dusty at her best,"There are several great reviews of this LP. So I won't repeat the well-deserved raves it has received. Just checking in as a longtime Dusty fan. I love her. I love this album and oh! Did I forget to mention that she is the white queen of soul? By the way, she is backed up by some top level studio musicians here. They push her and she rises. I'll say 5 words and shut up: Son of a Preacher Man."
4,As described,"Needed book for Javascript college class, excellent condition and material is relevant to my course of study. Newer edition may cover more in depth techniques."
4,Excellent Learning Tool,This Course Technology book is easy to follow. Step-by-step examples give you hands on experience in programming. Examples have illustrations to see what the results should look like. The few errors that are in the book actually help you to learn to debug your problems.
3,What's right and wrong with this pan,"I bought this pan because it was on sale at a great price. I've been buying commercial (restaurant) non-stick aluminum from restaurant supply stores for some time. I own three nard anodized Calphalon pans. This pan arrived in time for me to cook dinner with it two nights ago. When I took it out of the box, I was immediately aware that the handle makes the pan unwieldy. It feels that, if it is the least bit unbalanced to either side, the pan will spin in your grip. The lid from my ""chicken fryer"" fits this pan, which is a help. I expect my wok lid to also fit, though I haven't tried yet. The non-stick surface worked fine. A broader, more manageable handle and/or a helper handle would make this a great pan."
3,Good Item But...,"Do yourself a favor and throw away the lag bolts they give you and go out and buy 4 new ones. 2 of the 4 sheared off in the stud after pre-drilling the size hole they specified. Other than that the unit works great.Sanus Systems VMAA18B Universal Articulating Mount with Extended Reach for 30"" to 50"" Displays (Black)"
4,Great Mount,"I bought and recently installed the VMAA18B Mount for my new Sony XBR46. This is a pretty difficult process for those who are not handy. Fortunately, I purchased some seperate hardware for mounting as per other reviews and comments. This mount is very well made and comes with most of the required hardware depending on your tv model. The instructions could be better but were better than average. If you will want your sreen to be an exact distance from the floor or below table you need to measure VERY carefully. I had to take the mount off the tv and reposition ( only needed an additional 3/4 of an inch) so the bottom of the tv would allow for my center speaker placement. Overall, a well made product."
4,excellent mount,This mount replaced my original flat Sanus mount. It was very easy to replace as the flat mount that attaches directly to the wall was interchangeable with my original set. The articulating feature of the new mount makes watching throughout the room much better. You still need 2 people to lift the flat screen TV onto the wall. I also needed to get longer bolts to screw on the TV attachments to the back of my plasma. What was provided was very short and would be risky to use in earthquake prone California or anywhere else.
5,"Sanus VMAA18 Articulating Mount for 30""-50"" Flat Panel TVs - Black","Absolutely awesome wall mount. The mount is sturdy and reliable. It was recently put to the test in a 5.6 earthquake (centered out of San Jose). The mount rotates left and right and swings out a good 12"". The only draw back, as with many mounts, is that you need two people to hang the TV. It took two of us about 1 1/2 hours to hang this badboy. All of the wires are hidden behind the wall and the TV looks great hanging on the wall. Highly recommend."
1,I met this book and I doubt you will like it,"A disappointment. Newly rich wife Danielle Ganek has written a leaden narrative with a wooden ""voice"". Writing's sophmoric; sentences are simplistic & poorly stitched. The plot's like a harlequin romance or D cable movie; I easily guessed the ""surprise"" ending halfway through the book."
2,"A wimpy read, a nice story","It was a decent read, nothing memorable other than it was a wimpy, surface skimming look into the art world. Like so much else in today's art world - critics, artists, etc. - it was too careful. Since the author is a big-wig collector, it could be considered a parody within a parody. The characterizations of some of the personalities encountered in this book, Mrs. Connie Kantor particularly, do capture the cliche roles and vanity afllicted quite well. A nice, easy, read that even an art outsider would enjoy."
2,Beware,This is a book for modeling specialists and contains some very useful information. The background science and general discussion is often poor so it could be confusing to students. One major objection is the title with that terrible term 'computer modeling'. Models can be either analytical or numerical but I have yet to find a computer that can write a model of any type. The standard of the English grammar is also poor and lastly the price is prohibitive even for a library. There are many better texts and many better sources.
4,Explanation!,"Hello...I am John, a member of The Grapes of Wrath, and I'm here to clear up the confusion: Our band from Phoenix, Arizona predated Kevin's band by almost 30 years, and is not the Canadian band of the same name. The American Grapes have been active (and still are) in the studio and with live shows since 1965. The Canadian Grapes WERE indeed a GREAT band, but we were first :) (Note to Kevin: Best of luck on your new projects!)Thank you to all who purchased our CD and enjoyed it. To all others, we apologize for the confusion :)Regards,John H.The Grapes Of Wrath"
5,Hauntingly Evil!,"I lost a lot of respect for the almost immortal Sylvester Stallone, but teaming up with Dolly Parton, come on! A bet that Ms. Parton makes with her manager to change the tough guy into some Slim dude, horrible! She succeeds and her contract is terminated, but for us, it's agonizing pain! Stallone dresses like Whitman and sings awful songs with Parton. I was ashamed to have seen such a horrible display of singing! I would have rather buried my head into a deep pit full of bugs and infestation instead of watching this! But, wait, this movie does have zest and Stallone has pretty much set himself in stone as an immortal lord. He can do whatever he wants! Rhinestone cowboy keep dancing in those boots! Yes! I appreciate country music now! Please put this slobber-knocker onto DVD now! Twentieth Century Fox is the best!"
4,Super Dolly,"If you love Dolly, You'l love thishopefully it will be availeble in europe at the moment it isn't but if you ever have the chanche to buy it and you're a Dolly fan it is a must"
2,Not appropriate for a 5 yr old,"I got this for my 5 yr old for Christmas. The picture shows the girl having a bit of tummy showing and I'm fine with that. When my daughter put it on, she was so embarrassed. It barely covers her rib cage and shows much, much, much too much skin for a 5 year old. The pants are extrememly itchy and uncomfortable. We are taking it back. I'm really disappointed."
4,Buy this CD!,"If your like me, and will buy anything Don Van Vliet touched, BUY THIS CD! The sound quality is XLNT, Beef is in fine form, and he's playing behind a group of competent, professional Musicians. My four Star rating is because it's a little short."
1,"Captain Beefheart Minus The ""Magic""","Just days before this tour began, the (real) ""Magic Band"" quit and were replaced by a bunch of studio session musicians who never heard Captain Beefheart before... and boy does it show! Other than the voice, you would think you were listening to a different band all together... that's because you are. This would be better billed as ""Captain Beefheart and The Last Minute Replacement Band""! Add to this the fact that this tour took place between the infamous ""Unconditionally Guaranteed"" and ""Bluejeans and Moonbeams"" albums and features music from that time period... dreary stuff, especially considering how good the Captain was (and would be again)... but not in 1974!"
5,A Masterpiece,"In this compilation of wonderfully written articles, author Jeffrey St. Clair gently guides the reader through the harsh realities of the corporate world's devious and unrelenting assault on the environment. And he does it with remarkable wit and optimisim, and a keen eye for the most relevant details. Chilling in its accumulation, *Been Brown So Long* is the definitive account of how our natural heritage has been, and is being, squandered by the lords of power and greed."
4,"Has all the ""Hits""","Lacks only a few conditions, which--is not surprising, as it isn't the GIANT hard cover text. Very useful in clinic."
5,A Library of Information In One Volume,"David Bernard is the authority on Oneness Theology. While I take issue with much of what he teaches about Oneness I must acknowledge the genius of his book ""God's Infallible Word"". It is a library of information squeezed into one volume. Very easy to read in two senses: first, it is a quick read - it is not a long book (you can complete the entire book in a month by reading only six pages a day); and second, it is an easy read - once you pick it up you won't want to let it down and it does not read technically so it is fluid. Bernard compares the Bible to the Koran in terms of quality, authenticity and reliablity. He points out the Bible's contribution to Science and the facts of the Bible that compliment Science. There is a word glossary and a section that really compares the different English versions of the Bible that the average person would appreciate."
3,Not that great,"I bought this camera without doing much reviewing, because there was none at the time. The hard drive disk is really conveniant for easily deleting a video file after you just took it. Copying the files to the computer is simple, but actually getting them onto DVDs can be difficult. The main problem is the quality, it is a bit grainy a times in dark rooms. Also sometimes when recording after stopping the camera, it says ""video recording failed"". But then I go to preview mode and the video is there and fine. It doesn't make sense."
5,This is IT! The best Smokey Robinson & the Miracles collection available.,On 2 cd's Motown has finally put together a recent collection/anthology that is worthy of praise and it is this one. The songs go all the way back to 1959-60 when the Miracles recorded for Chess and End Records prior to Motown. Motown hit the sonic jackpot when they took the earliest STEREO masters and pressed them that way with 20 or 24 bit remastering. Forget about that big MONO Miracles box as well as all of the Miracles previous anthologies. This collection is the real deal.
5,great guitar for only $99!!!,"I am just a beginner ... I did not know much about guitars but wanted to learn. I purchased this one from another store for $99. I get a lot of compliments on the guitar :) when I mention that I paid only $99 for it, you have to see the reaction that my friends give me :) if you are a beginner, and if you want something decent and cheap this is the guitar for you. My only complaint is that it is very glossy ..."
5,"Punk sings Childe ballads, seaman songs, and other folk","Instant goose bumps. Think Elvis Costello or a young Graham Parker singing Childe ballads, seaman songs, English plainsong, and folk rounds with spare accompaniment (variously guitar, mandolin, accordion). Think punks singing their tattoos away at the end of a night of beery-good fellowship. Think Manchester street toughs finding grace and a way home to a world before machines, struggling wity heightened human feelings of yearning, frailty, heartbreak, and about death. Think a regular guy finding English folk in his blood, but no standard folk way to let it out.Tracks 12-15 use a full electric band and are characteristic of his other work. But they work well here too. [73:18]"
3,An ok disk,It seems as though Sal has not got his groove on through most of this disk.There are a few good arrangements but it just don't got that swing I remember from his way back Bop days.
3,Good HD for budget/mid priced PC!,Would have liked it to be 7200 RPM instead of 5400 RPM. Otherwise good brand name. Plenty of space for most users.
2,QuakerQuickGrits,"This product was advertised as a ""box of grits,"" take a look at the icon, not a tub of grits. Also, the ""best used"" expiration date of 9 August 2009 is not provided in the online ad. Small boxed grits are highly valued by native Southerners and hard to find outside of particular areas within certain Southern states. Tub grits are sold just about everywhere in the United States and one does not need to buy them online. In my opinion, this company does not provide full information at their website and the box icon is just a plain false statement about the product."
5,One of the most useful programs I have ever used,"Amazingly efficient and well designed program to create flowcharts and diagrams. Tons of uses, and great for visual learners (as a law student I use it to make diagrams to help me understand legal concepts)."
5,Very Surprised,"I was very surprised about the quality of the material. It was incredibly easy to understand and every lesson was a pleasure to go through. I did not get bogged down a single time nor did I feel that I do not get this. It will not teach you to be fluent in Spanish (only practice does), however, it taught me a lot and now I am confident about speaking Spanish."
