1,Please do not buy!,"The orchestra on this product sounds like a completely computerized MIDI piece of trash. And, Its not even complete. If find it much better to sing along with the CSR."
5,Very good overview for the begining aspirants of Jyotish,"This book was able to convey the spirit of what, for many of us Westerners is a very difficult and complex subject. Informative without being dogmatic"
2,Took FOREVER!!,"The book's condition was great, BUT, If I was to order from them again it would be at least two months prior to the start of my class."
1,The rod gets loose!,I ordered this spreader from Golda's and when it arrived.... When I assembled it the hole was too large for the rod or handle. Make your own it is cheaper. Golda told me to glue it. Why should I glue it when it was not supposed to be glued in the first place. It did not come with glue...duh!
3,"Not that great, first book so much better","I really loved the first book, ""Picture Maker"", probably enough to have on a top 20 list. I was quite disappointed with this sequel, which promised so much but didn't deliver. First of all, one thing that really bothered me was that there so many spelling and grammar errors. Whoever edited this book did a horrible job. Second, the plot summary of the book, Ingrid's so called journey back to mother's homeland, didn't even happen until the last one hundred pages. It should have at least started half way through the book.The story itself was rather boring and I had to put it aside a couple of times. Just no comparison with the first book. Better off just not continuing with this sequel."
1,you sent the wrong product and I can't return,this company sent me the wrong product and now they won't return for the correct one or for a credit. what a waste of money! I will not buy from this site again without a clear return policy.
5,Easy to reuse,"I was a little disappointed when I discovered I would have to buy this online, but Amazon works quickly, and the vacuum itself works too well to replace! Even though I vacuum a LOT, the filter picks up enormous amounts of fuzz and dust, which helps my allergies. As for replacing it--it recommends every six months, which is probably wise, but it gets clogged up in between, especially with the fuzz from the carpets and pet fur! I just pop it out and clean off the bulk of the fuzz (it pulls right off), and then take it outside and bang it against the stoop. It frees up all the dust from between the folds and gives me a nice clean filter every time! (Plus gives the birds a little fluff for their nests) I would not go more than six months though to replace it, especially if you have allergies."
3,Could be better designed!,"I love the vacuum! However, I don't like the added expense of purchasing new filters every month. Instead, I brush all the dust out weekly and wash it in hot water, then let it thoroughly air dry. Seems to do the trick and the dog hair and dust are cleaned up as well as when it was new. I like the comment by one reviewer of using canned air to clean it. I will try that idea next week."
5,Electrolux Vacuum Filter Pack,It was nice to be able to get new parts to replace a couple of parts that had broke on the vacuum cleaner.
3,Stick to the original set,"It's not worth the money. The original tile set with the game is fine, and you can pick out what you don't need. I bought this thinking the set that comes with the game might be too difficult for my daughter (age 7). I found that really this tile set is not much different. There are a few more types of fractions in the main set that comes with the game. Pick what you don't need out from the original set, and customize it to what you know your child knows on your own. Save the money for the advanced set (if that's worth it, I'll have to read the reviews before I go there)."
2,It's an okay book,"I haven't finished it yet, but after starting it, I find it a little hard to read. It a pretty wordy read."
3,Decent,"If you're looking for quick thrills, cheap shots, and sex scenes, this movie isn't for you. Despite the subject matter, there's a considerable lack of nudity and sex. However, an interesting cast breathes some life into a mediocre script and this film delves far more into depth and character study than sexuality. Two and a half stars."
2,Not Realistic,"This movie does have some interesting portions. However, it is chock full of unbelieveable characters. The male lead (not Culkin, the other guy) was the only one who was really interesting and who had some kind of a personality. There also was a general lack of nudity--something I did not expect given the name and subject matter. Watch it if somebody else is buying but I would not suggest wasting your own money"
3,Sex and Breakfast,Unable to review the film due to wrong R version DVD sent and not the originally requested UNRATED DVD Version
5,Great exhaust,This exhaust showed up early. The exhaust is new and is is exactly as promised. This should add some more horsepower.
2,Disappointing,"After reading the other reviews, I was looking forward to reading this book. Sad to say, I was very disappointed. I too gave up my child in the 50's and have reunited with him now that he's in his 40's. I was hoping for much more content on the feelings that the author experienced in reuniting with her son.Instead, I got pages and pages about family ""get-togethers"" in which the author went on and on about who was there (grandchildren, wives, daughters, daughters-in-laws, sons, husband, etc.).Moreover, being a professional writer, I felt the book was poorly written and needed a great deal of editing.Considering there are other books on the market for the same price that are 300% better (Primal Wound, for example), I felt it was money that could have been better spent elsewhere."
5,"I am not a friend of the author, but I praise him!!","Mark Edward Soper, can you just kind of ""pick up your shoe and I'll kiss the bottom?"" I hold a BSEE, a MSEE and I am a Microsoft Certified Solution Developer (2002). I cannot praise this author enough for this work, I have utilized his complete information from BIOS to preparing/formatting hard drives to troubleshooting the PC and it's subsystems from Windows 9x to XP all the way from A to Z. I can't thank the author enough, I wrote to him personally and thanked him. Thanks again!!"
4,Presto 06852 16-Inch Electric Skillet with Glass Cover,Just received it. It came very well packed. I will update as soon as I decide what will be the maiden voyage meal...any suggestions out there?The 4 stars is because there was not even a little pamphlet cookbook in there. I think all cooking appliances should have a rough draft cookbook for folks.
5,great,"Fast shipping, exactly what I wanted! Great ratings, so thats why I ordered this one. Think I will order another one for daughter"
2,It can fry... but it sticks,"I love electric skillets, but this one does not have a great non-stick coating. Everything sticks, even things that are naturally non-stick."
1,Poor quality,"We received it and returned it the next day. The quality was not up to our expectations. It moved all around on the counter. The legs are plastic and look as though they will fall off. It weighs a lot less than our same size Rival skillet. Basically it just looked and felt cheap. That all said, I can't say how well it cooks because we didn't try it out. Just be aware that it is a cheaply made product."
5,"Renovating Kitchen, needed real food","I haven't had a kitchen for about 6 months...long story. Got tired of pizza,mexican and chinese take out. Had a cheap microwave, hated the frozen dinners, then it blew up kind off. Got this and have been eating well since. Fries, sautees, roasts, boils and apparently bakes. Wipes clean with a paper towel, handy when you have no kitchen sink. If you have a family, this is perfect;I probably should have gotten the smaller one. Sent one to a friend in Hawaii inadvertently, her 2 sons and husband were extatic, allowed them to cook fish outside, no smell in the house."
3,It's really large,"This skillet is Jumbo sized - I didn't realize exactly how big. So big that it doesn't fit in my kitchen sink when I try to wash it. It's far too large for daily use for a single person, though it might be a good size for a large family. It responds quickly to the heating control, but I found that the surface heats very unevenly; there is a big difference between the heat around the edges and the cool center. I used it for about a month, but I'm getting a smaller one next."
5,Presto Electric Skillet,"Purchased this skillet after having another very similar skillet of the same brand for about 8 years. The teflon finally was wearing, but the skillet still worked and we donated it to the Salvation Army. Really like the product and it was a good price from Amazon. Had also priced at a few department stores, but this was the best deal."
5,Wonderful!,"I must agree totally with all the other positive reviews, This is the one to get if you need an electric frying pan. The heat control is accurate, the pan is easy to clean, and it's big enough to cook the largest portions, I even ordered the optional rack for the pan, which allows you to use it for steaming and some baking. The metal is thick and retains heat evenly, and the non-stick coating is excellent. Buy this one."
2,still looking for a good electric skillet,I have had this skillet for awhile and I do not like it. It is in perfectly good shape but I have begun looking for a replacement It is far better than the one I had before (Rival S16RB 12-by-16-Inch Oblong-Shaped Electric Skillet with Removable Pan: I didn't read the comments here and should have)but it still has problems. The temperature is difficult to regulate--things either burn or they take forever to cook--seems like there is no in between (i.e. perfectly browned) The skillet slopes into the center so it is hard to turn things and the handle is on the same side as the plug so that makes it even harder. The skillet is light but it feels very cheap.
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"Maybe their manufacturing process has changed or something, but this skillet started losing the non-stick after about 3 months of nothing but making bacon, eggs, and burgers/chops/steaks. No metal or anything else ever touched on the surface (bought the silicone spatula at the same time just for this) and yet it still started flaking. It seems to follow the burners under the surface. It's a shame, really; for about a month this was my favorite way to cook dinner, now just looking for somewhere to recycle this piece of garbage."
5,The Electric Skillet is awesome !!,"Santa brought this Presto Electric Skillet to my husband for Christmas, since he has been wanting one for ages.Well, we use it for everything...it sits quite nicely on top of our stove.The even heat distribution is flawless, and makes it ideal for cooking pretty much anything you would cook on a stove-top, and a number of things that might go in the oven.Clean-up is easy, and the skillet's weight makes it very comfortable to handle.We love it, and are thinking about getting a second one."
5,great,bought it for wife at christmas and havent given her a chance to use it because I am using it. great product and price. Check back in ten years or so
4,presto skillet review,I like the way the foods cook in this skillet. Clean up is easy and the foods cook quickly and evenly.
2,Disappointed,"I admit I want to return this ... when simmering, it only ""bubbles"" where the heating element is around the edges so I don't believe it gets hot enough. However, I got rid of the box it came in before I used it, so I may be stuck with it."
4,arrives broken,"all thought the item was unusable damaged in shipping, the seller did agree not to charge me"
4,Presto - not,"The Amazon order sequence was great, delivery speedy, product (Presto 06852 16-Inch Electric Skillet with Glass Cover) looked amazing, then I looked at the Voltage, only to find it is powered for USA only, not South Africa. Re-packed, returned with a heavy heart, got my money back."
1,Skillet Cover Can Be Significant Safety Hazard,"I bought the Presto 16-inch electric skillet with glass cover(06852) on 8/24/06 from Amazon.com. I was very satisfied with this product until yesterday when it was being used to heat chicken on the Warm setting. Without warning the cover exploded, spraying glass from the center of the cover everywhere. If I had been standing near it at the time I could have been seriously injured. I checked on the Internet and discovered that other people have experienced the same problem with other glass covered electric cookware. I will be replacing this unit with a metal-covered Presto electric skillet model 06850."
1,Total junk,"I bought this compressor to use as a portable unit; nail guns, air up tires etc. First, it will not start on an extension cord smaller than 12 ga. Second, it is often hard starting even plugged directly into an outlet. This compressor has less than two running hours on it, and I've gotten no reliable use from it. At this point I'm ready to give it away, So I pulled the cover off to clean it up, and discovered the casting broken just above the mounting bolt on both sides. I paid $200 for this thing, and got less than 2 hours of use from it, and now it is ready for the dumpster.Man, but this ticks me off.I will never, and I mean never buy another bostitch product!!!"
1,I will NEVER AGAIN buy Stanley/Bostitch products,"My compressor failed after owning it (bought new from Lowe's) for about 2 years. I did not use it heavily, and the piston and what looks like a fan failed...grinding to a halt with an ugly noise. My customer service interaction with Stanley/Bostitch (the maker) had them asking me to pay $116 for parts, when I paid about $160 for the product. For a few smallish parts (less than 10% of the whole) they want to charge me $116. My response to them: As I wrote to them, that kind of gouging is ""clearly an abuse of the privilege of having customers buy [their] products"". I will never again be a customer of Stanley/Bostich, and recommend that you take the same position, unless you like being gouged for minor parts."
2,Stanley Bostitch CAP60P-OF,"Purchased this product in 2007 and use sparingly. Have not been happy with the product. Had to replace the compressor head because one of the wafer springs broke. Then the safety switch stuck open and would not pressure above 20 lbs. Now the there is leakage back through the cylinder and will not hold pressure. Also, after pressure drops back for the unit to start again, somehow the cylinder is locked and the motor spins in the belt.I would not recommend this product."
3,Ok I guess,Well I'm not sure if they worked but they were alost black when I woke up so I guess they removed toxins while I was asleep
2,Can't quite get myself to like it... - won't be missing them,"I can't avoid thinking of The Flaming Lips when I hear Grandaddy. I cannot avoid it, I am sorry. This EP is no exception to that, but this time I also happened to have a hard time finishing it up. It felt like a meal I had to have, but fortunately it was not the case... I enjoyed the flavor of the first few songs, but eventually they start repeating themselves and toward the end of the album (""Florida"" to be more specific), they just loose it. They are no punk act, so I am not sure what are they trying to accomplish. I am sorry if this offends some fans of the band, but I won't be missing them."
5,Catnip Cute,"We checked out the ""regular"" Bad Kitty from the library and my son *5 at the time and now 6) loved it. When I saw the book with the bite out of it, I couldn't resist - not unlike a cat with cat-nip - and are very pleased with the purchase. The bite is real and goes all the way through every page and cover which I think adds to the charm, but may not be to everyone's taste. It's a cute concept and clever way to reinforce the alphabet and the moodiness of our feline friends.A fun read and good for the kid in ALL of us!"
1,"cut item, Amazon botched the packaging","The book is adorable. But Amazon really stiffed me on the packaging. they crammed the book into a package that was too small and broke the spine. I complained and, to date, have heard nothing from Amazon regarding what they did.I'm going to be switching over to Barns and Noble to buy books.Robin Barfoot"
2,Needed a better editor,"While I could write a lengthy review, it's easier for me to say that I agreed with the other reviewers who did not enjoy this book. While it was engrossing, it was tough to feel empathy or sympathy for the privileged author. She spent 25 years in a ridiculous relationship, rather than leaving and making a better home and life for herself and her children. Also, the husband had not one redeeming quality. The author portrayed him as a disgusting controlling dictator, and I found myself grossed out more than anything else.Mostly, what I had a problem with was the editing. Many times phrases and ideas were repeated within pages or even paragraphs of each other, while some situations that needed explaining did not get it. It was as if the memoir was edited by someone who was intimately familiar with the author's story, so close to it that they could see past the obvious gaps.Lastly, the epilogue was called a prologue."
1,BORING,"I read this book to read about a man with anorexia, not about the boring life of a woman married to him. I skimmed through the whole book to try to find the tiny paragraphs scattered throughout that are actually about his eating disorder. In my opinion, she uses his eating disorder to tell the dull, dry tale of her own life. Don't read this book, even if you don't care about reading about eating disorders."
5,Prefect,"This book was awesome. The cover was like brand new and it even a bit of new smell left. Not much, but just enough. Thanks for the awesome book."
4,Very good book,"It was great; I love the epic stuff, though this wasn't as great as the earlier books."
3,Jean you sliped a little on this one,"I have read all 4 books and I would have to say that this one lost me a little. It didnt have enough of the story line to hold me. I have a tendency to drift when she explaines the land or goes into to much detaile about certian things . This whole book was about travling and not enough about the story. If you took out the travling and extesive deteals about ""stuff"" it probly woulnd take up more than 20 pages tops."
4,I think it is a must if you want to continue with the series,"I think it was a little slow until Ayla and Jondalar meet up. But if you skip this one it will leave alot of information out that is important in the ""Mammoth Hunters"" So, those of you that grew to love Ayla in ""The Clan Of The Cave Bear"" Stick it out and read ""Valley Of Horses"". In my opinion you wont be sorry you did. Unitl Ayla and Jondalar meet up the chapters jump back and forth from telling what is happening in Ayla's life to what's happening in Jondalar's. This is a must read if you're going on in the series. And take from me or not, book 3 ""Mammoth Hunters"" is just as fast paced as ""Clan of the Cave Bear"", or faster.What I want to know from any of Jean M. Auel's fans is; How do I get my hands on The book ""Ayla's Herbs""?!?!"
4,Superwoman meets Mr. Hunk,"In my opinion this is the best book of the Earth Children series.Ayla, a Homo sapiens girl raised by Neanderthalers after her parents have died (book 1) has fled the clan and has found a pieceful valley to live in.It is amazing what she can invent all on her own: what took mankind hundreds of thousands of years she manages on her own in just three years or so. Even though this makes the story rather unbelievable, the writing is so entertaining that yu keep on turning the pages.Parallel with the story of Ayla's survival in the valley runs the story of 2 brothers on a long quest for they-don't-know what. One of the brothers dies, but the other one barely survives, meeting the love of his life, namely Ayla. All is well that ends well."
2,VERY slow start,"The first 18 chapters of this book really dragged. The story of Jondalar and Thonolan was exceedingly dull and could have been at least half as long as it was. For having so little pertinence to what happens later, it was way too long. Alya's intermittent story in the first 18 chapters was still worth reading, though. But it wasn't until chapter 19, when Jondalar and Ayla meet that it started to get really interesting. After that, the book was a much faster read. But considering that 75% of the book isn't that great, it was somewhat of a disappointment, after the every-page-is-interesting Clan of the Cave Bears."
4,Second in series,"This may have lacked just a hint (barely) of the tension in the first book, but it is still a page turner. The story continues with Ayla after she is banished from the clan. She's heartbroken at having to leave her son behind and the family she grew up with. She finds a wonderful valley and is finally joined with a companion.The erotic scene between Ayla and Jondalar is spicy! One of the best romance pieces I've read in a book that wasn't listed as a 'romance'.Chrissy K. McVayauthor of 'Souls of the North Wind'"
1,Waste of time,"Auel used all her talent in her first novel, ""The Clan of the Cave Bear"". This book, and the others after it, follow the same formula. Mary Sue character meets Gary Stu. Mary Sue is gorgeous, intelligent, gorgeous, resourceful, gorgeous, tough, gorgeous, courageous, gorgeous, kind, gorgeous, loving, and gorgeous. Gary Stu, equally gorgeous, is also very well hung, as the book reminds us constantly.The books go even further into fantasyland as the series progresses, with Ayla Mary Sue given more and more amazing qualities, so that she achieves near-superhuman status, while Gary Stu Jondalar is, as we all know, very well hung."
2,A real change of pace from the first book,"I have to say that I was very dissapointed reading this book afterhaving just finished Clan. The former book was absolutelyground breaking--an insight into an alien culture that said asmuch about the Clan as it did us. But this book, is more of aromance/survival/animal friendship story. To me it read likea combination of ""The Blue Lagoon"" meets ""The Black Stallion""meets ""McGyver"" meets ""Lassie"". Ayla spends the first half ofthe book befriending wild animals and independently inventingmost of the major innovations of the stone age. Then shemeets a man that is a wandering Casanova who has neverreally fallen in love with anyone. Will Ayla be able to tame himand get this ""bad boy"" to finally settle down? You'll have to readthrough many missunderstandings and lost oportunities to findout."
5,Breathtaking Pre-historic Saga,"Set in ice-age earth. Ayla has left the cavemen that have raised her in search for her own people. This novel was fascinating, being set with just the main character and her survival skills in a pre-historic world, with cave-bears, mammoths and other dangerous creatures. She found contentment on her own with her animal friends. I found this not only educational but it also drew me into Ayla's world. She leaves her valley in the end after finding love in a tall stranger from the north. Read Clan of the Cave Bear first to better appreciate this novel, you will not be disappointed. Highly recommended."
5,want more! Can't find them.,"I absolutely love these wine glasses.They are a fine design and fun to use, even if they need to be hand washed.Delicate and sturdy."
4,"Some Sears Christmas ""WISHBOOK"" photos: 1950's-1960's","Just as the previous commnetator stated, this book does not contain all the SEARS Wishbook catalog photo from the 1950's-60's.However, since I only purchased this VOLUME ONE, it could be that VOLUME TWO had more Sears catalog photos, ---those not shown in this Volume ONE.I still enjoyed this book though, for it's historical value. As also stated by the previous commentator, this book is not really a DOLL & TEDDY BEAR Value book, but rather, it is more a book that compiles some of the 1000's of Sears catalog photos from their CHRISTMAS Catalog."
5,Best foreigner interpreter of American Songs,"Renato Russo sings some of the best American songs with such a deep interpretation that we can really feel the pain, the hope, the happiness depending on the song.I really recomend this CD."
1,swisher trimmer line,I do not have the swisher in my possession. I did not have the need to use the extra trimming wire.
5,What can I say,These are hard to find in any store around here. They came quick and work well. Ordered two packs should last me a few years.
5,A Collegue's Review,"It was my pleasure to receive a signed copy of Jim Martin's second book as a gift from the author. I had read ""Push not the River"" several years ago and hoped for a sequel. When I read the first few lines, I was immediately entranced. The writing is beautiful, the characters are clearly drawn and the plot is engaging. I could not put the book down, as Mr. Martin takes us through the years of the French Revolution from the viewpoint of the Polish involvement. One must read the book carefully to find the characters moving ""Against a Crimson Sky."" I eagerly await the continuation of this series."
2,This book put me to sleep several nights in a row. . .,"I fell in love with the heroine, Anna in Push Not the River, yet in this book, Against a Crimson Sky, she had little more than a walk on part in much of the story. If anything this book concentrated way too much on military minutia and history of Poland and did not balance the original story of Jan & Anna's romance enough."
4,Against A Crimson Sky,I read this book as it is a sequal to Push not the River; both were excellent books combining history as well as family life in Poland during the war- one of many the country has survived. I could not put the book(s) down. Would highly recommend
3,Not As Vibrant or Rich As 'Push Not The River',"Push Not the River was James Conroyd Martin's first book about Countess Anna Maria Berezowska. Which was based on Anna's own personal diary.In 'Against a Crimson Sky' Martin creates for the reader a fictional continuation of Anna Maria's story from his own imagination.I was not as satisfied with this story, I was disappointed to learn that this book was entirely fictional, which I failed to realize until I had already started reading it.I'm glad I read it but this was not as moving as Push Not the River and the characters were not as realistic or vivid. The details of the military progress sometimes bordered on tedious. And we don't really get to know Anna's sons except through their dialog.I thought Push Not The River was a great book, this one wasn't as satisfying."
5,Great Buy!!!,"I love this cd! It's worth every penny. I can't stop listening to it everyday. Donna Summer is amazing! A classic :) If u love disco music this is the perfect cd for u :-) Favs:Hot Stuff,Bad Girls,Radio,After Dark,Take Me Home,I'm Ready,Do That To Me Once Again,Last Dance"
1,Kind of blows,This book drags all the way through. I was hoping to hear more of the 'horrors' of the times in prison and the nastiness of the creeps that George Jung had to deal with (including himself) in the drug business. This book falls flat.
2,The original is pretty lame compared to the Care Bears series that followed a few years later...,This is the ORIGINAL Care Bears series. If you enjoy the Care Bear movies and the syndicated series shown on the Disney Channel in the 90's - then you should be aware of the fact that the series on this DVD preceeded the movies and the syndicated series. I find this series to be lame compared to the one that followed. I accidently purhcased this thinking it was the one I grew up watching on the Disney Channel and was very disappointed.
1,Care Bears - Care a Lot Adventures,THIS ITEM WAS NEVER SHIPPED AND I WAS CHARGED FOR ON MY CREDIT CARD - I DO NOT HAVE ANY GOOD FEED BACK ABOUT THIS VENDOR!
1,Was of money and time,"The questions are odd, poorly edited, and actually have wrong, inaccurate answers. Don't waste your precious time with this book. If you looking for questions, get PreTest."
1,It doesn't work at all.,"It DOES NOT work, and it is really sad because all the non toxic claims sounded great, but if it doesn't remove the polish... what's the point?I bought this for my little daughter, to prevent her from toxic exposure to regular nail polish remover, but its performance falls short of our expectations. I didn't return the product, but would never buy it again nor recommend it."
2,Take a little work,"This remover, although healthy for you and your nails, takes a bit of work to remove the polish, but I guess that's why it's not bad for you."
3,Takes a While But Does Work,"With two coats of Acquarella, it takes 5 minutes to remove the polish off each hand, which isn't too bad. However, if you have on several coats, it just takes too long. I quickly swipe each fingernail before I begin removal so that the remover has time to soak in, which does help a lot.Karma Organic Tea Tree Nail Polish Removerworks faster for me, but this isn't ideal for using Acquarella, because the oils can interfere with Acquarella adhering to the nail. I am still new with using all these products, so I haven't yet reached my own verdict. For now, I use Karma if I have on several Acquarella coats, but before polishing with Acquarella, I lightly buff my nails and then I swipe each with the Acquarella remover and then rinse before polishing."
2,SOAPY AND DOESN'T WORK!,"THIS DID NOT DO A THING TO REMOVE MY NAIL POLISH!!!! The reason i gave it 2 and not one star is b/c my nail polish is from a nail salon and probably the ""bad toxic kind"" so I will give this one more chance with my nontoxic piggy paint polish but as it didn't even put a dent in the other stuff, i don't have high hopes.as for letting it soak for a while.... i let it soak for like 30 minutes and it still didn't work!"
5,Comforting & inspirational,"I have read both volumes of ""The Grand Design"". I was surprised to find that Mr. McMahon's views of 'the universal order' were very similar to my own. I like the conversational writing style and the short chapters make it easy to pick up the books often to read just a few pages at a time, perhaps on a particular topic. I have found the books to be inspirational and comforting and would highly recommend them to all."
5,Excellent Reminders...,"Having just returned from taking Lonnie's class, I found myself having a hard time trying to remember everything he taught on making dovetails. I'm really glad I bought this video as it gives me the chance to go back and review his tips and techniques when cutting dovetails. Lonnie does an excellent job of breaking down this skill into manageable steps, and with practice, I've been very pleased with my dovetails. You'll get a real good idea of what his classes are like when you watch this DVD, and you'll find that you will start cutting dovetails with confidence- and they'll look great! Like the furniture that he builds, the classes that he teaches, and the books that he writes, this DVD is quality work."
5,"buy it, you'll like it","There are probably a dozen ways to cut dovetails but this is the only one which has such high quality videography combined with a master craftsman's knowledge of fine woodworking. Lonnie is a gifted teacher who has a remarkable ability to ""share the trade secrets."" This DVD takes the viewer through the necessary practice steps to the layout to cutting of both through and half-blind dovetails. His method is clear, repeatable and effective in producing excellect results. With this DVD, it's like having him coaching you over your sholder. You can't miss with this one."
5,Just what I needed!,"I took a class from Lonnie and bought the dovetailing DVD to reinforce the things I learned in class. The DVD was excellent and I would recommend it to any woodworker, novice or experienced. I too, have read countless ""how to"" articles and debates on hand cut dovetails, but for me this was the best by far. It is packed with information, so you need to watch carefully as well as listen carefully to this DVD to get the most from it. The DVD also shows some great examples of work using this technique. There is also a section on sharpening chisels to get these results. That was an added bonus for me.There are many places to go and learn how to make hand cut dovetails, but I think learning from, and following the tips in this DVD will absolutely give results any woodworker would be proud of. I am much more confident in my dovetailing abilities because of this DVD."
1,WARNING - READ CUSTOMER REVIEWS BEFORE BUYING,"I can't exactly review using the product because upon receiving it I wanted to RETURN it. I was sent a product that had been shipped AT LEAST once before and returned. The carton the product was shipped in was SO SEVERELY DAMAGED, parts were falling out of it, plastic parts were broken and items in the box very likely were lost in shipment. There were previous shipping labels on the carton. A company that does business this way is a company to NEVER DO BUSINESS WITH!!! I am recommending to Amazon it is a detrement to have SWISHER as a supplier!"
1,Hype's Corner,"This album has to be among the most over-rated of 2005. It's even found its way into Mojo's top ten. I've given it time and space to grow on me after my initial negative reaction but each listening alienates me further, The songs are derivative, lyrically bankrupt and horribly over-produced. Hawley sounds like a middle of the road ballad singer of the 1950s/60s without the safety net of strongly written songs.If you are considering buying this, I urge you to listen to it first."
4,Disaster DVD 4,"I enjoyed this product because it contained 4 movies of good length and exciting action. They were movies you could watch with your family and not be offended. I would recommend this item if you enjoy ""what if"" movies."
5,"Manners, Character and Graceful Parenting","Karen Santorum delivers a rich text compilation of poetry, stories, and wisdom for parents, educators and children to enjoy and ponder through a life's journey. This is a great discussion tool to use with your children to help explain values, virtue and manners to children. A must-have for home educators and for teachers in the classroom. My children enjoy reading selections on their own as well as ones that I highlight for family discussion. A much needed collection for our day and age where manners and virtue are trampled by the popular culture. Would make a great gift for a parent, grandparent or teacher!"
3,I bought for my twin 5 year olds and it is not written for small children.,Looks like a good book. It uses a lot of big words. Difficult to comprehend. The children it is being read to need to be older then 5. I am thinking this book would be great for a 9 or 10 year old and up.
4,good collection of stories and poems to teach morals,"This is a great collection of poems, book exerpts, and stories geared towards leading a child to good morals and desirable habits. My daughter (6 yo) loves reading these stories and poems.The book is divided into sections, each focusing on a different moral trait or good habit, such as honesty, good table manners, and responsibility. Parents and children will find this collection interesting and entertaining. Many exerpts and poems have a humorous bent, which helps to freshen a possibly dry and tedious topic. Exerpts are taken from a wide variety of authors, from L.M. Montgomery (_Anne of Green Gables_), to the whimsical Shel Silverstein.This is a book that is a great resource for good manners and habits."
2,Book of Manners,"I was not impressed at all. This must be a book you need the ""secret decoder ring"" of estrogen to understand. I returned it. I read many positive reviews prior to purchasing, but was disappointed with the content. There are many other stories and books that I would like my children to be exposed to with respect to their character development. I was expecting something far more practical."
5,very nice nail gun with a very nice price,"i purchased two of these nail guns. had to have it with being able to nail joist hangers plus a reg. nailer very nice item. also has great power. i like n88rh for durability, balanced very well, hope i could help but for this great price for the money. i dont know of another nail gun that you get all these features for this kinda price"
1,An Ed Wood movie with more budget,"Are you people insane?? Do you have brains whatsoever?People who likes this movie, is people who only wants no-sense action and visuals.It really takes you out of the equation when it comes to criticize a movie.Really.There is no connection between the scenes or the themes, or the characters ""motives""It is the worst movie I've saw in the last few years. And I saw a lot of Z-Movies that I think are far better than this.There are really few bad movies. And I mean BAD movies. Movies that go against everything they teach you at film school. And this one does it.If you like this movie, star thinking about taking cinema classes or judgment if possible."
1,HORRIBLE!!!,"I watched this Dreadful, Hideous, movie only because Scott Glenn, John Hamm and Carla Gugino were in it.They should be ashamed for being part of a movie so bad that even the 16 year old boys that it was apparently made for would HATE it.I can't believe that this movie was ever produced.What a mess!"
5,Well worth the price!,"This was an amazing deal on a great movie.Includes two discs: One features the theatrical cut, second features a directors version.Also features the original animated shorts of the movie's 4 realms and ""behind the soundtrack"""
5,Beta Programming,"Great film and wonderful ""in your face"" references to Delta, Beta and MK Ultra programming. All in all a very important film which displays dissociative conditioning and how it works. A+ for entertainment value."
4,DVD Rated R but Bluray Rated PG-13?,"This is more of a question than a review. I saw Sucker Punch in a IMAX Theatre and it was awesome! The story had the Watchmen/Sin City feel to it with a Inception fantasy storyline. My question is, why are they putting the DVD out as rated R and not the Bluray as well? I know in the theatres it was rated PG-13, but if they are going to add a scene or two and give it that R rating, can't they do it for the Bluray? Will it still be more worthwhile to by the Bluray version than the DVD with a little more footage or more blood,etc????? If anybody knows the story on this please response. Thanks. Dan"
1,"A great idea, done wrong","I don't want to write a long review. The opening to this movie is an interesting premise, but that's where it ends. The pacing is poor, the characters are lifeless blow up dolls. The film proceeds from the initial hook as a boob and special effects fest for no apparent reason other than to please the younger male demographic. If you want boobies and panty shots, this is for you. Basically it is A-list soft corn porn for the timid underdeveloped males. If you're a grown up looking for a film with more depth than a puddle of primordial ooze, seek elsewhere."
2,Another depressing movie...,"What would ever prompt someone to write a screenplay that ultimately leaves you feeling depressed? That's never a useful reaction to anything in life, much less a movie. Aren't movies supposed to be entertaining, and therefore not make you want to go drown in a bottle of vodka and eat a heaping helping of narcotics to end the day? Well, they failed with this movie. There is no happy ending, and the beginning tells you why. Gosh I hate this movie. It's right up there with District 9."
1,Disappointing,This looked like it was going to be really good but really it was quite poor.Even the girls were not that hot.Story was pretty stupid.But you live and learn.
1,Just Plain Awful,"I enjoyed ""300"" and ""Watchmen,"" so I had high hopes for Zach Snyder's latest offering. But it's just terrible. The paper-thin plot, the manipulative cartoonish set pieces, the ""acting."" Nothing redeeming in value about this thing. Snyder thinks that interspersing an uninteresting soap opera about pretty little girls with vingettes torn from hyer-violent video games is good storytelling. It's not."
1,Worst SF/fantasy film of the year - unless you're a virgin,"Stupid pointless comic book anime wannbe childish abusive junk. Awful wish-I-could write like Frank Miller but can't, the main character doesn't say more than one line for the first 23 minutes ... makes no sense whatsoever, and the loud music doesn't make up for low budget FX ... think Sky Captain quality, not Clash of the Titans, ""better than videogame"" but barely. Seems like it's for boys who never grew up and/or wish they were chix. Don't waste your time on this mutt! Go watch Scott Pilgrim instead - that movie doesn't suck. This movie is really really bad."
2,disappointed. Action flicks should have more Action.,Very disappointed when I watched Sucker Punch. I was expecting a lot more action and story. You should know before hand there absolutely no plot to this film. And you will be watching the movie just for eye candy alone. Unfortunately there was not enough action scenes to qualify the movie as an Action movie. It's very slow moving and very bad acting. It's so bad in fact it's actually annoying every time an actor speaks. I give this two stars because their some nice visuals. Overall I would not even reccommend watching this movie.
4,Action but not a lot of plot,This has great actionand the overall video game look to the movie is interesting. The plot is a little weak for a movie. It would probably be OK as a theme for a video game but as a movie it falls short.
3,Sucker for Sucker Punch,"The graphic WW1 scenes are to die for. I haven't seen the ""Great War"" like that on screen anywhere. Total fantasy and a honest way to blow a few hours. Politically dubious story, though. Anti- German, for sure!"
4,Good movie,"This was a really good movie. The imaginative power driving the movie reminded me of when I saw the first Matrix movie, and more recently Inception (although I give both of those movies 5 stars, whereas I think this movie is just over 4). Although the cast was young compared to the Matrix or Inception, I thought they played compelling roles that draw the viewer into the story. Overall, definitely worth renting or buying. Definitely 4 stars based on pure imaginative power alone."
1,"Awful - 15 minutes of cool, 75 minutes of asylum","The trailers make this movie look amazing, but in actuality it's an extremely bleak picture of girls in an asylum who have horrible things done to them - in cold blood. The fantasy action parts are amazingly cool, but you feel robbed of the excitement when 'reality' keeps getting worse and worse. Avoid at all costs."
1,Ban Zak Snyder from using a camera... please,"This is one of those movies that is becoming sadly more common now adays. It uses weird, slick camera angles, slow motion and mediocre visual effects to try to fill in the holes left by lack of characters, a terrible dialog, and no recognizable plot or development. Seriously, what the hell? Once you saw the blonde teenager with a katana, and a samurai with a gatling gun, you knew it was only a matter of time before someone showed up in a battle mech."
1,sucker punch the let down,this movie absolutely sucked.the charecters bring you into a dream world to cope with everyday problems.you enter the dream world like 4-5 times during the whole movie.it is sad that this whole movie is based around women whom are eye candy and that is what they push on you in this movie.as a man i don't care how good looking women are in a movie or how tight their clothing is.if the plot of the movie sucks the movie sucks plain and simple.I would rather go to the dentist than watch this again.
1,Sucker Punch your a sucker to buy this dvd.,"What can I say about this movie that other's have not already.it's sucks. there I said it it sucks. When this dvd drops to $5.00's I'll buya copy just so I can have a copy of the very good 3d work.but as a movie it's a suck hole.Personal recommendation don't use amazon movie reviews to pick a movie your looking for.Far as I can tell people are pumping up bad films to get them sold.no one, with even a half a brain would think this film deserved more than one star.I only give it one star because I can't give it zero stars.Get your reviews from [...]"
2,Knew how it would end within minutes....,Luckily i was able to view this movie without paying for it...glad i did.There is nothing in this movie that will make me want to see it again.Some good effects...but tied to a story that's not that good...maybe good foryoung adults and kids but for the rest of us its sure ain't a piece of art.You get tired real fast of a bunch of kids easily killing everything that comesat them...even if its not real...its not that entertaining...
3,EH......,Not as good as I remember it when I first saw it lol. Kind of drags after that amazing first fight scene.
1,Everything that is wrong with Hollywood,this movie is just absolutely terrible. it is composed of mindless action scenes with a terrible plot in between. I should have been more weary after Snyder destroyed The Watchmen. I thought I'd give it a chance for 4 dollars on Black Friday but it seems like I was absolutely wrong what a waste of 4 dollars. Can Zack Snyder please refund these 2 hours of my life that were totally wasted?
2,Rent not buy,"1. Hot chicks in lingerie...check2. Lot's of guns, explosions, and anime style action...check3. Gorgeous dream/video game style backdrops...check4. Sophisticated plot...there is a plot?5. Character developement...girls with guns in lingerie killing Nazi's and Orcs...how much character developement can you really expect?6. Main character has about as many lines as Kurt Russel in the movie ""Soldier""...check, but she wears a little anime school girl outfit (with pig tails) and kills (slaughters) the bad guys with a samuri sword/1911 45 all while looking cute and vulnerable so who really cares right?Worth a watch (girls/guns/lingerie/Nazis), but certainly not a very good movie."
2,Confusing,Me thought that movie be about someone punching Madonna in face. Me must have been wishing that the case. Oh well. Me throw movie in garbage and Madonna probably stink worse than garbage. Ah-so.
4,Why do people hate this movie?,Its a bunch of chicks awkwardly staring off camera on a soundstage and throwing terribly slow and off-balance karate kicks. What more do people want out of cinema???
2,Subject matter is sooooooooooo depressing!!!,"I was so disappointed in this film. It was so depressing due to the subject matter. I really believed this movie was going to be some kind of action yarn with an upbeat storyline. Instead it had some very dark twists to it. The special effects were good, but I couldn't really get into it because of the plot was so depressing to me.I probably went into this movie with very high expectations due to the trailer I watched.I can only give this movie two stars."
2,as a sequence of cool images. it's amazing,"Beautifully detailed fantasy worlds and some pretty darned good acting in support of far too little story to justify all that work. But, man, as a sequence of cool images it's amazing."
3,SuckerPunch,The music was really good. The concept was good but not original. The movie itself was not that great but made redeemable by the ending.
3,Get it for the CDs,"I've been a DMB fan from the beginning. After purchasing every release available from this band, I have to say that the live recordings of these songs are great. ""Bartender"" is chilling, it includes their cover of ""Time of the Season"", and even ""American Baby"" stands out. However, as far as the DVD is concerned, I was rather disappointed. There are rare moments when I do get those chills (""Louisiana Bayou"" is particularly impressive), but the overall over-the-top energy that is usually present in the band's previous DVDs is overshadowed by the ""yawn-fest"" induced with songs like ""Dreamgirl"", ""Everybody Wake Up"", and the one song that is featured in nearly every single live DVD put out by this band...""Crash"". I love this band, and I hold tight to the belief that it's not their decision to put out such lukewarm releases. Hopefully they'll get more of a say next time."
1,bad song selection,"i have heard much better DMB shows on bootleg, this thing is a rip off! I dont care at all for it. Do yourself a favor and stay away from this travesty!"
3,dvd portion,"I expected the dvd to be the actual concert, but it is just a making of the concert. Very disappointed."
3,shock labyrinth,"movie was ok,3D was ok,though it was little better in 2D.couldn't get into movie as much.it was an intresting product."
2,I just could not get into the swing of it all,"This book just never interested me from the get-go. As a matter of fact I had a hard time finishing it because I did not really care what happenned or to whom. I was expecting something in the Douglas Adams Hitchhiker series, and was not entirely disappointed. The book has its moments of irreverence, and some of the humor made me chuckle. However, the plot dragged and the story seemed predictable. Maybe I was just in a foul mood but this is one of the few books I have ever read in which I just didn't care....."
4,Fun!,"Pratchett has done it again! Fun, entertaining re-visit to Diskworld. I just love Granny Weatherwax! There are plenty of Diskworld books to keep us going, and it is wonderful they don't have to be read in any particular order. I'm a constant traveler to Pratchett's wonderful world."
4,TP30 pitcher replacements,This is the 2nd time I've replaced the pictures for my ice tea maker. You must have two. Unfortunitly the pictures leak after several months and need to be replaced but they work well and the tea is good.
5,Tea Pitchers,"These were the exact duplicate of what came with the Mr. Coffee Tea Maker. Mine were still functional, but I did not read and put both of my originals in the dishwasher trying to get out the tea stains... well they were really warped and would not line up to the tea maker, I got these and I am very pleased."
4,Robert a new customer,"When I ordered this 2PK to go with the Mr Coffee 3Qt Iced Tea Maker, the picture showed blue covered lids which matched the Iced Tea Maker. The actural items I received had white lids but even though I was disappointed I was able to get them to work."
3,"They last about a year, but at this price.....","My original pitcher got warped in the dishwasher so I ordered these replacements. We make at least a pitcher of tea a day in my house and we use both pitchers (one for sweet and one for unsweet). So each pitcher gets used every other day. After awhile they get stained from the tea and nothing will take it out. After about ayear, the plastic starts to craze and crack. However, at this price I will gladly replace them once a year. This tea maker is still the most convenient I've seen and makes great tea. Hey... Mr. Coffee... make a better pitcher!"
5,The most underrated songwriter in the world,"I'm not sure when people are going to finally discover the genius of Gerald Collier. He is a contemporary songwriter with no match. I think people too often peg him as Alt-Country without realising that the strongest influence that come through in his songs are Elton John and John Lennon.His lyrics are just as brutally honest as they get. Very disturbing actually. Maybe this is another reason why people don't get him. A line like, ""I was up thinking to myself last night/ how much better I'd be if I'd have shot her on sight/ how much warmer I'd be between my sheets/ with the blood of her body washed all over me"", really seperates itself from your typical singer-songwriter fare.I think this album is fantastic. Probably his best work to date. Discover him now while there's still time to appreciate this masterful songwriter."
5,A time in a young man's life...,"This is the first album by the Mountain Goats, where it was written mainly about himself, about John's past.John used to have a major addiction to meth and these songs are so beautifully written in a form where they are never judgmental, but purely observational to a time in his life that was hard, not only for him, but hard on friends and loved ones that he had to watch decay as well.We Are The Young Thousands is one of the battle cries that comes forward, as well as a repetition of the line ""and the headstones climbed up the hill"" during ""Palmcorder Yajna"", which turns out to be one of the most wonderfully written songs ever.If you are a fan of tMG's, this is a must memorize album. If you are a fan of folk rock, another must have, but if you are just starting out with tMG's, I would suggest another album or two before this one."
2,Infinifilm doesn't mean Goodfilm,"I bought this DVD without seeing the movie because my mother highly recommended it and because I wanted to see what Infinifilm was all about. My wife and I were extremely disappointed with the movie, especially because we liked the first one so much. There doesn't seem to be anything new or original, just more stupid. All those who think Jackie Chan movies are going downhill, raise your hand!We like the Infinifilm concept because it prompts you to watch the special features that are all too often neglected. Too bad for us this DVD will be often neglected!"
2,Stupid stupid stupid,"Chris Tucker is without a doubt one of the most annoying people in film today. His nasal screech and pop-eyed overacting are like nails on a blackboard to me. In ""Rush Hour 2"" he portrays an utterly dense and racist American cop, which will do nothing to improve the image of Americans to overseas audiences. Jackie Chan is as agile and chaming as usual; he and a few good action scenes in an otherwise moribund film are the only reasons it gets two stars. The wonderful Zhang Ziyi is criminally wasted. Seeing ""Rush Hour 2,"" it is easy to understand why Asian stars such as Gong Li and Michelle Yeoh decline to make the leap to Hollywood."
2,"Good Movie (only for the Laughs, Horrible Kungfu) Bad DVD","This is without any doubt, one of the best comedies in the history of movies, but at the same time, it is the worst martial art Film of all time. The DVD's infinifilm special is STUPID, with the exeption of the extra deleted scenes. Half of the special infinifilm features are about Jackie chan's stardom in America. If u are looking for a good action flik this isn't what you're lookin for."
2,"Chris Tucker, you shoud've stopped at Friday","Nobody has the guts to give a movie a bad review, the outtakes were pretty funny, NOTHING ELSE! So predictable. You could set your watch to the fight scenes, about one every 7 minutes. The whole time they were not fighting, I was saying, 6 minutes, 59 seconds, 7 minutes, there's one. It was terrible, and the only reason I gave it 2 stars was because I remember Smokey from Friday. ONLY REASON! Chris Tucker, only play stoner ghetto characters, anything else,...! Peace"
2,Don't take offense...,"This was really a very crappy movie. I tried to give it a chance, but I ended up twiddling my thumbs and whistling the Charles in Charge theme.Maybe it's my hatred for ""buddy comedies"" (like that one with Owen Wilson and Mr. Chan-- ""A Not Funny Take on the West""...), but this movie sucks ballsacks. I first noticed this when Chris Tucker spoke, then the plot began to unfurl, yet Chris Tucker kept speaking. The crappy jokes didn't help it along, either. Usually, when you mix action and comedy, you come out with a quivering, inbred form of entertainment. I think you'll see what I mean when Taxi comes out.I know, it's harsh but it's true. And don't shoot the messenger; the messenger of common sense."
5,"Funny, ignore bad reviews, trust me!","All these other reviewers don't know what they are talking about. First of all, Chris Tucker is funny. Some of the jokes (VERY, VERY little of them weren't laughed at [1-3]) are funny. If you don't like chris tucker then I don't know what to tell you. Second, Jackie chan puts lots of action into his movie which is very good. The chan movies all have about the same plot but the jokes and scenes are what make this movie different from most of them. It is VERY funny and action packed. The women in the movie seem to play a modest role. They are supposed to be the main characters but somehow seem not to (probably because of Chris & Jackie's jokes and scenes). This movie is overall VERY good and VERY funny. It is one of the few where people actually clap at the end because they liked it so much."
5,Even Better Than The First!,"When I went to see this movie in the theater, I wasn't expecting much. To be totally honest, I was expecting a likable ""same old, same old"" entry in the Rush Hour series. Boy, was I surprised! This film was BETTER than the first! It was FUNNIER, MORE EXCITING, and even more UNPREDICTABLE! It had more twists and turns than most films of this genre. While you'll LOVE this movie if you're a fan of Chan and/or Tucker, you're bound to love it if you're merely a fan of action/adventure comedies. Highly recommended!"
2,A waste of Jackie,"Even Jackie Chan can't save this film. The plot is dumb, Chris Tucker's character is too thin to take seriously, the bad guys are stupid and the fight scenes are cut too quickly to have the fun of watching Jackie do what he does best. Why does anyone think bad writing will be covered by lots of action and still be successful??"
2,Sexist comedy that tries to expose a non racist rap,"This movie portrayed women only as objects of men's desire. In trying to put humor to racial tension by sticking a black guy with a chinese guy, the oppression of women is used as a playing field. As the black and chinese man break racial and cultural barriers, they dig women into a deep, deep hole by being obsessed only by their bodies. There are scenes where women are portrayed as submissive tenants to men (in the chinese spa) and scenes where women are spied upon in a sexual manner (jackie and chris spying on the agent in the hotel). Although the agent is a woman she is depicted as helpless and useful only to look at as her plans to unveil the chinese mafia's crime are ruined by the men's (Jackie and Chris) insensitivity to the operation. Even though this movie may do justice to race relations it gives a big TKO to the oppression of women."
1,The man who ruined X-Men,"This was a stupid film. It is not funny, it is not entertaining, it is garbage. No wonder X-Men; The Last Stand was stupid."
1,Chris Tucker needs a lesson in other cultures!,"In typical Jackie Chan fashion, the action and fight scenes were great. As an Asian-American, however, the jokes poking fun of the Chinese culture and others were too much. Chris Tucker chose the most evident things to make jokes about, and displayed the tendency of some Americans to be closed-minded about other cultures. It would've been nice if Tucker redeemed himself at the end, but he continued to be the same close-minded jerk throughout the movie. Were it not for the awesome fight scenes, I would not have enjoyed the movie at all."
1,No play by the way,"This cd had a good selection of songs but unforgently it skiped all the way through.I'm going to attempt to get a replacement.I have had real good luck with Amazon, and expect the problem will be resolved promplyI noticed it comes from Germany, maybe there a chance the format is differant there?Looking forward to getting the replacement and hoping it plays OK."
3,Rubbermaid needs to redesign it's packaging,"Although this product is a great storage solution, the packaging is inadequate at best. My unit arrived in a shredded, low-grade cardboard box, with a massive quantity of tape applied by the UPS delivery people. I tried in vain to assemble the unit but the panel corners were crushed. Again, not the fault of Amazon.com but a combination of poor packaging by Rubbermaid and poor handling by UPS.I'd recommend that you plan on being home when your unit arrives and refuse the delivery if there is any external damage. Once you open this item you'll never get it back in the box."
1,I would pass on this DVD,"The DVD is poorly made. The cover states 'Newly remastered version' so I would hate to see what the old version looked like. The video quality is not very good. But the main problem is the quality of the music. The DVD consists of about 50 riffs that Eric Clapton played. Each riff is introduced on the screen as 'Riff 1', 'Riff 2' etc. There is tabulature included, which makes this DVD of some value. But there is hardly any talking by the instructor or introduction to the Riff, ie from which song it is from. Some of the riffs are recognizable in terms of the songs they are from. Most of the riffs, I didn't recognize, even though I am a big Clapton fan.The instructor doesn't show you how to play the riffs, he just plays each one, one time and then let's you figure it out from the tabulature. I was very tempted to return this, but then I thought I will use it as a reference one day, so it will sit on a shelf for a while."
5,Ugly and Effective,"Yes, you aren't going to win any style points for this vest, but I bike commute to work and it is hard to miss. Very durable construction and was shipped fast from the manufacturer. Nice reflectivity and day/night visibility - no complaints at all."
5,Litter Box Carpet,This really helps in keeping cat litter from being tracked into a wide area. It is surprising how much it helps minimize the mess of a litter box.
4,Absolutely Necessary,"This is our third...yes third...Litter Maid system. We bought them when they first went on the market.The first two Litter Maid systems came with this carpet as part of the system. If you don't have one of these, it's likely your cat will track litter from the box. It's an essential item.On the Litter Maid system; it's the plastic gears in the roller/scoop mechanism that wear out and if your use the wrong litter or if you fail to heed the instructions on filling the box, it'll also wear out the gears. BUT...it's a beautiful thing when it works as designed!"
2,Nothing special,"This is a ok card for high end, but not worth the money. If you use it with no AA enhancements its stable, if you use AA it degrades the performance really bad, I ended up going to a Radeon 9800 after years of using nvidia cards, ATI has gotten so much better and nvidia is sinking in performance, they just can't seem to get a high quality card out lately that can compete with ATI. I hope next year they can do better."
3,its good,the picture does not really match the color of the wallet. its more like a light blue color . .
1,Not really applicable to most North American situations,"Get this from the library before you buy! Luckily, I did! It was disappointingly lacking in functional medical knowledge, given the title. Most of the book kept drifting into discussions of handling political/social/superstition issues associated with living in tribal/Third World villages. I found the implied assumption that these people groups do not possess even a modicum of common sense regarding basic hygiene to be elitist at best, and downright insulting at worst. Get a copy of the American Red Cross First Aid and Safety Handbook, and go forth armed with your own personal knowledge and sensitivity to others - you'll be miles ahead of this book. I really had high hopes for this reference before I read it - maybe a later edition will be more focused."
3,Medical questions,I was disappointed. This book was not what I was looking for. There is some good information but not enought to use at my home incase of an emergency. Where there is not doctor.
5,"By far the best ""Home Doctor"" book around","As a person living in tropical Asia, health is always a concern and health care is not often very good. Therefore I have continually used this book in diagnosing and treating disease which I may pick up along the way. The advice has always been accurate and the instructions easy to follow. Note that the emphasis of the book is on tropical medicine but is highly relevant to anyone living in a remote area where health care is distant."
4,Works great as a basic paper clip holder,Purchased because I was tired of fishing through my desk drawer looking for the paperclip box. This magnetic holder does a good job. I use it to hold a mix of paperclips and it gives me easy access to the different sizes as I need them.
3,big and loud,"Compared to my 2 gallon Crafstman corded wet vac, this kinda sucks (no pun intended). It's far louder, bigger, bulkier, has less suction, and I guess I'm a bit disappointed. It's a pity though, because it's an idea that I've been waiting for ever since I bought their excellent 14.4V drill (and saw and light combo)."
1,Worse Movie I've Seen in a Long Time,"Smiley FaceThis movie is so bad, I stopped the DVD and read a book."
1,Slow-paced and un-funny,Awkward and slow-paced without being funny. Fine if you go for that kind of thing. Others should avoid it.
1,mildly entertaining,"Ok, Anna Faris is easy on the eyes, even as a stoner girl. But even if it took mad acting skills to pull off that character, this film is pretty much a waste of time, and can't hold a match to other films and TV in this genre: Fast Times..., Trailer Park Boys (get this!), Half-Baked, Cheech & Chong, etc."
5,nearly peed my pans,"I know it's not that appealing for those who have never smoked, but for those who have or have known those like Jane.....this movie will make you laugh straight from the belly. It could be better, but its pretty damn good compared to what else is out there, and for my money, much funnier than Harold and Kumar . Anna Faris is hysterical, a true comedienne,..I have loved her since Scary Movie and will continue to search out movies with her. She carries the whole film, which would not be even half as funny without here (and the same can be said of Scary Movie). I can't wait to see THe House Bunny. I have caught Smiley Face on cable several times already, and I have to say, as much as certain scenes get old, it still provokes laughter in certain parts, and that to me is the hallmark of a great comedic movie....if you still laugh after repeated veiwings. Love, love the part in the sausage factory, and with the prof's mom! So INSIDE!"
3,Anti Marijuana movie in disguise,This is the first stoner movie I've seen that seems anti Marijuana. It's about a girl who's life is a train wreck and the more stoned she is the worse it gets. Moral of this story getting high will ruin your life. Aside from that the movie wasn't bad. It had some laughs.
1,Worst movie ever made!,"Saw the movie on TV one night, it was so bad that I tried to watch it for the novelty value and couldn't even get more than 1/2 an hour in. I bought it for a friend as a bad gift because we have made that a tradition, of exchanging the worst gifts we can find. There's no way he'll out do me this Christmas!"
1,Waste of Money,"I honestly can't describe how angry I was when I viewed this ""Basement"" tape. Not only is the quality of this video awful, but the presentation is less than impressive. I agree wholeheartedly with the previous review that recommended buying the Austin City Limits tape. At least that's worth listening to. This is just plain pathetic."
2,This Video is More Entertaining Than Spinal Tap!,"Curt Mitchell has the SRV playing style down cold (You'll realize this when you hear the opening riff to ""Testify""). As an instructional method though, this tape leaves a lot to desire. The information about SRV's playing style isn't all that informative. Additionally, the tapes breakdown of ""Crossfire"" is pretty complex & unfortunately the chart included with the tape isn't terribly helpful. Honestly, do yourself a favor & get the ""Live at Austin City Limit Tapes,"" & "" Live at El Mocombo."" These tapes are high quality & give the you the real deal..."
1,Paranoid Android,"Negatives- My alpha lock is less than 1 mth old and is already rusting underneath the paint- Can be hard to lock/unlock at times (key gets stuck)- Does not come with rim locks (thief can just pop off the wheel)- If car gets towed, your wheel/car will probably get damaged to some degreePositive- Easy, fast to install- Can provide some peace of mind for the extremely paranoid....."
3,Informative but has not been updated.,"I purchased this in 1997 from Dover books which claimed that it had been updated. When I compared it with the original hardback from the 1960's it was obvious that it had not been updated. Despite this, it is still an informative book for those interested in poisonous snakes."
4,HANDY WALLET,THIS WAS BOUGHT FOR THE PURPOSE OF HOLDING MONEY OR OTHER ITEMS SAFELY AND PROTECTIVELY. IT WORKS FINE FOR MY NEEDS. IT CAME IN QUICKLY AND WAS EXACTLY AS DESCRIBED. MMF INDUSTRIES DID A GOOD JOB OF SHIPPING IT AHEAD OF SCHEDULE. THEY HAVE MANY OTHER SIMILAR PRODUCTS AND AM SURE I WILL ORDER OTHERS AS NEEDED.
3,Trying hard to be Murakami,"I am a great fan of Haruki Murakami, and was very impressed by David Mitchell's first novel ""Ghostwritten"" which managed to combine the magic of Murakami's modern Japan with a truly inventive plot. Not so ""number9dream"". This is a pale imitation of Murakami's magnificent novel ""Norwegian Wood"" right down to borrowing a Beatles song for a title. The book lacks the economical beauty of Murakami's writing whilst at the same time using characters and plot that are essentially Murakami's. There is also an extremely annoying chapter that is interspersed with unfinished children's stories. The book's strengths are its descriptions of modern day Tokyo, and if you like a bit of violence and action in your books you will prefer Mitchell's books to Murakami's. It's well worth reading, but not before ""Norwegian Wood"""
3,Even Geniuses Have Their Off Days,"Between the twin glories of ""Ghostwritten"" and ""Cloud Atlas,"" David Mitchell published the unsettling ""Number9Dream."" The narrative slides--often without warning--between fantasy and reality in contemporary Japan. In general, I found Eiji's reality far more interesting than the undisciplined fantasy scenes."
5,The Perfect Daily Devotional,This is a wonderful Daily Devotional It is all wall to wall scripture Put together in a remarkable way!
2,What is Val Kilmer Doing In This??,"Moscow Zero is a tiresome film. It takes a good premise and does nothing with it. The plot centers around a priest (Gallo) searching Moscow's underground for his lost buddy. There is supposed to be some supernatural angle but it is very weak at best.For some reason, Val Kilmer is in this movie, playing a gangster that runs the underground. He says a few lines then thats it for him! There must be a big demand for illicit activities in those tunnels..The ending of the film is a real mystery, it just ends. Nothing is really explained. You can skip this one.."
5,Excellent & fast!,The DVD arrived faster than expected and was exactly as described. Thanks for getting this to me before Christmas! Awesome!
4,Great DVD,"This DVD was what I expected in a different format. I thought it would be more like the old cartoons, but it is very CLASSIC. I still love it though! Everything is original and updated. Very short and sweet. I would recommend this to anyone looking for classic Pooh stories."
5,Great collection of Pooh stories,"Yes, we all love Winnie the Pooh. However, the main reason I prefer ""The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh"" over any of the other Disney movies featuring Pooh Bear is the way this movie is set up. It's a compilation of several of the classic Pooh short stories, instead of one long movie. I find my two-year old gets much more out of watching the individual 10 minute stories, as opposed to attempting to sit through a full-length, animated film.Thus, keeping the little ones (ages 1-5) and their attention spans in mind, I highly recommend ""The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh"" to be a must for any family video collection!"
1,Something my dear mother really wanted!,"so i wrote before how it was operating pretty good considering there were some severe scratch marks left on the disc.... apparently i was highly mistaken about this. it has been freezing and everything. my mother has been wanting this for very long time. it was an impossible mission for all of us to try to find it and when we did the new ones costed at least $147.00-$259.00 . so i thought hey this person is selling a used acceptable version of the same movie i am trying to get at $50.00 , you can't beat that! but apparently you can if yours that costs a fortune actually works and is in more than decent condition. honestly i am beyond infuriated at this point. sellers please do us customers all a favor and stop FALSIFYING INFORMATION ABOUT A PRODUCT YOU ARE SELLING! i will gladly want a refund of this product from this seller. buyers be warned you never know exactly what you are getting."
5,It's been a long while...,"...since I've seen this, and I'm SURE more stuff has been added, but I just can't express my love of Pooh, Tigger, Kanga, Roo, Piglet, Rabbit, etc. (Uh oh...I forgot Eeore, oh bother.) The addition of ""The Wonderful Thing About Tiggers"" animated video ensures that I'll get this soon. I'm sure that every adult has already watched it, loved it, and can't wait to pass it on. If you're too young for a credit card, pester your parents for it. Mention that it's for a Disney movie (esp. Pooh), and they'll most likely buy it for you."
5,great for children,"my young child loves watching 'pooh' and he loves to mimic what is said in the film-plus when he watches it buys me time to make dinner, clean up, etc...great child-friendly program"
3,Lincoln Logs,The tin came severely dented which detracted from the gift. It was pricey considering how little the amount of Lincoln Logs were inside. I would not purchase it again for another gift. The upside? It's Lincoln Logs.
5,wow max on video,wow I can remember seeing it everyday before going to school on tv just realized tonight that it was once on video I loved mighty max hey if anybody thinking about putting this show to dvd I'd vote on it and certianly buy it.
2,Unknown,"im curious i need to know before buying, why is this product so expensive, why is the cover showing only two episodes... and is this mighty max all 40 episodes, or just two because if its only two then this is a rip off dudes lol. give me some product sucriptions here..."
1,I'd give it zero stars if I could- Absolute garbage,"Poorly designed, poorly manufactured. Frustrating for adults and children, no fun for the whole family!!! Very flimsy construction, poorly made valves for the bubble fluid, control for allowing air into apparatus to fill bubbles is almost painful to operate. As others have said, smoke generator is useless, even when following instructions to the letter. The half-filled (and leaking) containers of smoke and bubble fluid only add insult to injury. As far as making bubbles is concerned, even with much practice and patience, we can make far better bubbles blowing them the old fashioned way. Stay FAR away from this..."
1,"No good , no good , no good","This is a poorly produced DVD, with little educational value.Save your money and buy a decent book, like Van Halen Best Of, Volume I for example.Van Halen Best Of, Volume I (Best of Van Halen)"
4,Great New Single From The Boys,"I'm constantly amazed, 20 years into making music the PSB still come up with good quality catchy singles. This should be another top 10 single for them in the UK, probably won't even be released in the USA...."
1,Jaw Droppingly Amazing,"There is one good thing about this DVD. In the extras there is an interview with one of the ""actors"" who apparently is straight. THAT boy should have a mantel full of Oscars. Otherwise this is the BY FAR the worst thing you'll see this year. Your jaw will drop in amazement at the ""acting"" of the middle-aged college students and the ""plot"".If you have a choice between being buried alive and watching this movie, grab a shovel."
1,The concept is good but...,"The concept is good but it stops there. The script is somewhat amateur, the casting is unrealistic in age/maturity perspective and most of all the acting would fail most high school drama classes."
3,"Improbable, but Okay.","Okay, we had fun watching this, but goofing on it was part of the pleasure. Just HOW old are all these college students? And what exactly makes these ""straight"" characters definable as straight? Lots of unintended silliness."
3,Not Ronstadt and Kline,"No, the photo used on the DVD cover is of the actual Madison Savoyard Cast. This is a DVD of a live performance. Rohstadt and Kline were certainly not involved in this production."
2,"No es lo mejor, si no una parte de lo mejor.","Mismo que el CD diga que es lo mejor de ""Love Unlimited"", solamente algunas músicas pueden asi ser llamadas, destaque para ""forever in love"". Algunas músicas no merecian estar en el CD y otras deberían estar.Merece la pena por cuatro o cinco músicas, las demás......."
3,Wonderful Weirdness,"Mesa of Lost Women, is as bad as can be, but is also so full of wonderful weirdness, especially Harmon Stevens as the insane Dr. Masterson, that it nearly achieves a kind of freakshow greatness. Unfortunately, the ""monsters getting the people"" scene, which I assume was supposed to be the most exciting, is far too drawn out & boring, which brings the entertainment to a screeching halt. Then there's the soundtrack music - apparently a 3-4 minute recording, edited into segments that are repeated so many times that it will surely drive you insane. Still, a must see for lovers of bad movies."
3,"Good advice, but hard to follow","Coercive manipulation is at heart an appeal to the emotions. It's hard not to simply react in the face of this. Still, the book is fairly short, well laid out, and deals with keeping one's integrity in the face of guilt and intimidation.Because manipulation is so much a part of the fabric of our society, this book is a good first step in learning how to break free of conditioned response. I'd advise the serious reader to get some books on NLP, ego-transcendence or Albert Ellis."
2,Plastic Breaks,Worked great for a week then the plastic broke. If you are cutting a few pieces it might be the right tool but for heavier use its really just a toy.
1,not practical,"I felt this book was too engraved in oriental culture. With all the moving of plants and suggestions of painting my house every color in the spectrum and sleeping so my head faced east, I felt the book was turning me into a fearful neurotic. My house will look more cluttered than ever. THERE ARE MORE UPLIFTING BOOKS ON THE SUBJECT."
5,I came late to this party....,"But it was worth it. If you enjoy ""real"" people in addition to your hard SF, this is it. I wish all big theme SF was offered in such human terms as this author has mastered."
1,Science-fiction for people who don't like science-fiction,"This is a story about many things: longing for love, a lover had, a lover lost. Politics, business, and a power struggle between father and son. There are science fiction elements sprinkled into the long, winding tale - but a sci-fi tale it's not.Like the main character who is afraid of confrontation (won't go after the girl, won't stand up for himself, won't look into the box), Wilson sparingly teases you with interesting sci-fi concepts, only to beat a hasty retreat back to his comfort zone. This relegates the majority of the book to the minutiae of daily life and exquisitely boring relationships.This is science-fiction for people who don't like science-fiction."
4,Great science; not so great fiction,"The premise is very interesting: that Earth is in a time bubble that results in the rapid aging (relative to us) of the universe. This allows Wilson to explore some interesting scenarios. I had some quibbles with the writing. I didn't find the character interaction that engrossing. Perhaps discussions about religion and millenialism aren't my interest; I also think it was heavy-handed. Finally, I didn't think the flashback organization was necessary. It detracted from the natural progression of the story and characters."
3,"A Good Yarn, But ""Stars Go Out"" Beginning A Little Clicheo","The sudden disappearance of the stars and the enclosure of the earth in some kind of bubble seems to be an increasingly common story opener in SF these days (see, for example, Greg Egan's ""Quarantine""). But while sharing a common premise with lots of other SF books and stories, Wilson's Spin manages to distinguish itself with some nice character dialogue an a satisfying ending that hangs together well - more than can be said for many SF books in this genre."
5,Another PBS Classic,"I am so grateful to PBS for their wonderful work. I saw only 2 of this 'House' program, before it finished running on TV. I was so delighted to finally get the whole program to view from start to finish.The most remarkable evidence of money corrupting people was displayed in this program, as the people chosen to play the lord and lady of the house became less and less in touch with the reality of the world in which 'their servants' lived. The pompous lord and lady actually believed that they were deserving of such outrageous attention. They showed less and less compassion for others, as they fell more and more into their roles. Is it any wonder that the servants despised them, before the series ended.It was this 'House' program that has lead me to view and buy more of the PBS DVDs."
4,A partnership made in..?,"Tim Booth of James, and Angelo Badalamenti, frequent composer for David Lynch films, team up here in an album that is simulatenously experimental and accesible. ""Pop sensibility"" flows together, as these two musicians, so much alike in tone and flavor, create some really moving music. Sometimes a bit moody, sometimes a miss here or there, I get the feeling that some of the stronger songs aren't hit/radio friendly simply because they're too literate (or depressing..)"
4,Real players,"Ujwala complains in his review that 3D Bridge Deluxe lacks the range of playing options and teaching resources of Bridge Baron. These are points well taken. However, 3D Bridge Deluxe has a distinct advantage for Macintosh users: online play. Bridge Baron only supports online play for Windows; 3D Bridge Deluxe allows Mac users (OS 9 or OS X) to play online via the GameSmith server. Playing with real people is both more instructive and more fun than playing with even the best computerized partners and opponents."
5,A moment with Ms. Riddick,"The first time I've heard about Carol Riddick was on the booklet from the classic ""Who's Jill Scott?"" where Ms. Scott encouraged her to SING. I got a big nice surprise when I heard her sharing the microphone with Musiq Soulchild on that AMAZING track titled ""Best Friend""Since then, I have been looking for Ms. Riddick collaborations (check out ""Float"" where she provides backing vocals for Anthony Hamilton) and bought the album ""Moments Like This"" from iTunes.It is like a summer breeze, Carol Riddick's voice caress your ears and takes you to another dimension. I do really recommend you to get this album, as I already had a digital copy, but I really needed to listen to her music on a proper cd player!!Looking forward to new stuff from Ms. Riddick!"
2,Average at Best,This Set is Mostly FOrgetable.Send One Your Love is a Classic but the Gems to Find Here are few&far in Between.Come Back as a Flower is a Good Song.but nothing Overall here is on Par with Songs In The Key Of Life.Stevie is a Great Genius but even a Genius has Duds and this one is it.Skip it.
4,The first digital recording,"I saw stevie on Phil Donahue promoting the album. He said it was a ""digital"" recording done by sony in japan, the audience just stared at him having NO idea what he was talking about.this was 1979"
5,Better than I remember,"I had this on LP decades ago, and have been looking for the CD set (or MP3/AAC) for years. I am so happy to have found it. The sound is so much clearer on CD--even after all these years. As for content, I didn't buy it for ""Send Her Your Love""... you can get that cut anywhere. I got the set for ""Outside My Window"" and ""Come Back as a Flower"". Both have such clarity. You can hear the fingers stick to the accoustic guitar strings between chord changes, and the vocalist breathe."
5,A Flower From The Heart,"Believe it or not this album may in fact BE Stevie Wondercreating his own statement of intent.A musical journey emcopassing soul,sentimental balladry,classical and traditionalChinese and varrious world music ""The Secret Life Of Plants"" isan overly peaceful album so grunge fans BEWARE!Especially on""Power Flower"" and ""Send One Your Love"" this album is full ofgentle,pastoral musical backdrops and rose-colored sentiments.It does tend to give one confidance that there is still a greatdeal of beauty left in the world.Only that this album suffers inthe tempo department as only the incoherant ""Race Babbling"",therousing ""Tree"" and the funny ""Venus Flytrap And The Bug"" are thealbums highest tempo numbers here.Personally much of my sentiments are expressed here but one simply has to take what ishere in for themselfs-the album is very all-encompassing."
4,You know it was your hit.,"I was a big fan of getting ""cheap"" paintballs. The way i saw it, I could buy 4000 for the price of 2000 of the Evils. After several games, I could not distinguish who I had shot. My friend was using Evils and all of his victims were congratulating him for great hits. People would get called out from splatter because the paint was such good quality. I buy Ultra Evil Paintballs now. Although they are more expensive, I love the feeling of knowing who I lit up in the field. If you want an awesome round that clearly defines you as the shooter, buy Evil. I gave it a four because they have broken in my hopper before leaving me to clean out on the field. (it happened 2 times out of 16,000+ evils that I have shot)I shoot a Smart Parts ION."
4,The Pharoahe Has Finally Returned...,"After 8 years away Pharoahe Monch is back with a vengeance. Although I don't believe this effort is as good asInternal Affairsit still blows most of today's so-called hip-hop out of the water. The production on the album is mostly really good, and of course Monch's flow is nothing to mess with. On most of the tracks he shows the passion and emotion that madeInternal Affairssuch an excellent album, but there are a couple songs that sound a bit flat. The tracks that do stand out are; ""Free"", ""Desire"", ""Push"", ""Let's Go"", ""Bar Tap"", and ""So Good"". Overall this is one of the best hip-hop albums of 2007, and any Pharoahe Monch fan should be very satisfied with it."
5,This product works,"Mega-T Green Tea works.I am 46 years old, 5'6"" height, lost 15 pounds in 10 days, was 192 pounds, now 177 pounds. My diet is Breakfast of EAS Myoplex Original Chocolate. Lunch is Subway 6"" Turkey with American Cheese and Mayo. Dinner is anything not fried or too heavy in calories. Exercise is daily stretching, 30 reps of sit ups and push ups daily, light weightlifting on Sundays, tennis on Sundays, 20 minutes Elliptical on Sundays. Try it."
5,A Must Read!,"For those who wonder if the ""Old Testament"" is alive and well and relevant for modern Believers this is the book. Ariel & Dvorah Berkowitz have done a wonderful job of explaining why Gentiles can not only belong to the God of Abraham, of Isaac and of Jacob but also live happily with the teachings found in the Torah. Furthermore they examine a number of New Testament scriptures often used to ""prove"" the ""Law"" has been done away with. The authors, by the way, are wonderful people."
4,A slick version of Johnny doing his thing,"Production wise this is good stuff. Mr. Watson wears many hats on this disc, and how it was missed by the public is beyond me. Again, I am not going to try to sell you on why this is a good disc, but I would be remiss if I didn't. If your a fan and you don't have this in your collection, I gotta ask why not? Funk is it's own reward afterall. Check Johnny on the keyboards. He really went all out to clone his style in the area of production and what you hear in the vocals, good stuff. I still miss the concerts. This is another one of those discs that you listen to, when you want to have fun listening to the music without being critical of it at the same time."
1,Misleading Ads,"This bassinet is frequently and falsely advertised as compatible with the Qinny Zapp. It is not compatible with the Zapp and only compatible with the Quinny Buzz. If you are looking for a stroller that has compatibility with a bassinet and a car seat, check out the Bugaboo line of strollers. They are more expensive but there are used strollers available and new fabric to replace the used fabric. We are much happier with our Bugaboo Chameleon although it would have been wonderful if this Quinny Dreami had been compatible with the Quinny Zapp."
1,There are many other better choices,"This book started out very slow and was a continual disappointment throughout. The character development is shallow and devoid of insight into the Napoleonic campaigns it addresses. The book provides only superficial glimpses into the life of these men and their comrades. Please exhaust your reading of Cornwell, O'Brien, Pope, Shaara, Mallinson (often overlooked), Forrester and others before you subject yourself to this quagmire of a read. It is unfortunate that we cannot get a better effort from the perspective of the French while there are so many that address this era from the side of the British."
3,"Good book, but tedious and overdown","I like this book, but I felt that it didn't really have a main point, it didn;t fit in all that good with the other books in the series, and the character Russou Howell was not portrayed as he should have been. This guy was the friend of Trent and felt the honor and everything else that Trent felt and yet he is a drunk and semi-evil???"
3,Twilight series member...I think not!,"This is a typical Thurston novel. He's one of my least favorites of the various Battletech authors, and this latest try just solidifies those feelings.The novel has a place in the Battletech universe, though it's place is not in the ""Twilight"" series. This novel adds nothing to that storyline arc, and serves as nothing more than a distraction to it. This book would have been much better released as a followup to the last of the Jade Falcon series by Thurston.The only contribution it makes to the ""Twilight of the Clans"" series is it perhaps gives a very small insight into why the Smoke Jaguars behave the way they do in later novels by Gressman."
1,Most pointless BattleTech novel I have ever seen,"Robert Thurston is a good writer, so I suppose I'll have to forgive this poor excuse for a novel. He takes a strong and somewhat enigmatic character like Horse and ""wastes"" him a a confusing plot. He also ""wastes"" a good man like Russou Howell by turning him into a drunk sadist. This is nothing like the honor and decency that Russou Howell has showed up to now...He was supposed to be one of the Good Guys!!!"
3,The book...too different,"I agree with the rest of you. The book added very, very little to the Task Force Serpent story. Then again, how many of you think it's amazing how they got this far? Let's face it, the Clans will eventually be killed off, the writers have an obvious bias towards the Inner Sphere..."
1,Not Part of the Twilight Series.,"This novel is a continuation of 'I am Jade Falcon', which was itself a follow-on to the 'Jade Phoenix' trilogy. If you are into the Clans, even for completion's sake, you could skip this book and not be missing anything.Set about a year before the events of Operation Serpent's invasion of Clan space this story details Khan Pryde sending Aidan's old comrade Horse to the very same Huntress, for reasons we never do find out as nothing that occurs has any bearing whatsoever on later events as the Smoke Jaguars are destroyed. Actually, despite it's length this novel is in my opinion little more than an overly detailed prologue to 'Falcon Rising'.Basically, this entire book could have been written into another novel as a short outline of events to flesh out more of Star Colonel Howell's background...which was more or less done in 'Shadows of War'."
3,Confusing and inconsistent,"Overall, this has the makings of a good ghost story, but it seems to have fallen flat. It is heavy on the melodramatics of the characters and inconsistent in their physical descriptions. Grace is first described as ""auburn haired"" with ""milky skin"" and firey green eyes"". Later, Grace decribes herself as ""plump"" with ""short brown and silver hair"". Then there is ""Elaine"" who suddenly becomes ""Sylvia"" in the middle of chapter 3, then comes back as ""Elaine "" again in the midst of chapter 4! Add to that the run-on and incomplete sentences with erratic puntuation, and you have an annoying, distracting hodge podge that the proof reader and/or the editing person sholud have spotted and cleaned up. As another reviewer said, ""a good beginning"" but this lacks the polish and sparkle of Kay Hooper and Jayne Ann Krentz who Ms wilson appears to be trying to emulate.Sorry I wasted my $$$ on this disappointing book!"
2,Haunted!!!,"I agree with a previous reviewer, this was a poorly edited book.. Who the heck is Sylvia? That was so jaring, I read about one character who hired the protagonist, and then mid book the character's name changes. I could never get into the book after that. If the writer cannot keep up with the name of the characters in her book, and the book is only 181 pages, there is a problem. The subplot of the missing daughter was never clarified either. Did the daughter run away or was she kidnapped? Over all a very poorly written book, which is a shame, because the premise could have been excellent."
2,Irrelevant!,"This book is about selling cars, not ANYTHING. Also, it's not very good about that. It's extremely outdated; things have changed so much since JG was on top that at some points reading this book is like a history lesson.Also, the info, with a few exceptions is vague filler. I would have rather paid a buck for a 20 page book, which was all that was needed.The funny thing is that the title sold me, so I guess he was doing something right there."
1,Waste,"This book was such a waste of money and time spent reading it. Unless you are in the car sales business, this book will not do you any good. The title of the book in my opinion is decieving. The advice is basic and again it only pertains to an individual who sells cars. Not to mention, the author toots his own horn too much throughout the book. He spends so much time talking about his greatness at sales. Total turn-off."
5,Beyond the chair will grab your attention.,"Dr Jennings work gives the reader an insightful look into hynosis and regression therapy. She obviously has wealth of experience in the area and succesfully transmit her experience into a compelling and entertaining work.This book is far from the cynical and dry accouint of hypnosis you might expect from an expert in the field. Dr Jenning's is able to use case studies, and fascinating one at that to allow the reader to takemuch more then a glimpse into what her work is all about.I highly recommend this work to all readers."
1,Do not buy!!,"Do not buy this product!! The polish doesn't stay on your nails, it peels off easily. Not worth the money!!"
4,Great to Condition Your Nails But Hard to Remove,"I bought Acquarella Conditioner to use to condition my nails before painting them with Acquarella Nail Polish. The conditioner looks really nice when dry, like a shiny clear nail polish. It only has a very slight glue like smell when applying it. I think the conditioning process helped to make the nail polish stay on my nails, since the colored polish lasted for a week on my fingernails. My only complaint with Acquarella Conditioner is that it is difficult to remove. I pre-soak all my nails with Acquarella Remover and then use lots of remover on each nail, so it gets bubbly. After about half an hour of scrubbing it still does not come off all the way. I finally figured out that after using the remover it helps to soak my nails in warm water and use an orange stick to scrape off the rest of the conditioner."
3,be careful shipping!,"The book is great! I bought it as a gift. However two of the corners of the hardback were a little crushed, even inside the package! Great book though!"
4,Great Jig!!,I hesitated to buy this jig due to another review but ended up buying it anyway. I saw the mounting area he was talking about and it's no thinner then the original base plate but with all the extra weight hanging from the side it could stand to be a little thicker. I had no problems connecting my Dewalt router to the jig and the accuracy of the jig is great. For what this jig cost buy it!
3,King for Kids,"I had not heard of this short novel before seeing it on the shelf one day. I at first thought it must be by one of those authors with the same name as famous author Stephen King but no it is actually by the same man who wrote Carrie, Christine, It and other classics. This is also the first Stephen King book I have found which also has pictures. It is sort of like a children's book written by Stephen King although it is still a horror story. It is basically just a short story released on its own instead of as a collection together with other stories. Cycle of the Werewolf is not his greatest short story ever written. That title would have to go to The Mist, Autopsy Room Four, Riding the Bullet or Trucks but this story is better than a lot of his other sort stories and the illustrations are brilliant. This would be an excellent novel for either kids who are moving up from junior fiction or for your self to read as an adult."
3,Cycle of the Werewolf,"Readable, competent, sort of basic horror fiction. Nothing wildly original about it, but then it came out in the early 80's. Has the nice humanistic side of much of King's writing. Brought down by the art, in my opinion -- static, boringly representational stuff."
4,Good for younger generation horror,"This book was pretty good. I have to admit that it wasn't one of the best unlike Christine or The Stand, But it held it's own. I would recommend this book to a little bit younger crowd like middle school. The horror is not at it's highest peak so it won't totally scare them."
4,Cycle of the Werewolf,Lost my original copy by loaning it to a friend. This completes my Stephen King collection. The paperback book came in excellent condition. I would buy it again if needed.
3,Great looking book,"The quality of the book itself physically is excellent and I loved the artist pics throughout but there isnt much to the story beyond the werewolf and his victims and though it has its moments, they go by so fast and its hard to feel very involved as a reader by the end. Its not terrible, better than most werewolf stories Ive come across. Its just not nearly as good as many of King's other works.Its a good quick read and if you must own all King's works, then buy it here for the nice discount."
2,"I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone, werewolf or not.","The hardback Special Edition of this book is so rare you can only find it at auctions. The book itself isn't great, but it is also rare,and it wouldn't hurt to have it"
1,Yawn!,"This book is not only disappointing and unfrightening, it is pretty darn right boring. Cross the street to avoid it"
5,A great soundtrack,"Anyone who loves 28 days later has probably noticed the amazing soundtrack. This was a gift for someone who has loved the soundtrack for ages and she really loves it. The cd looks great. The inside is very much in theme with the zombie/apocalypse theme of the movie. The inside of the case is very explicit, so I wouldn't recommend buying it for someone who is more conservative. Also, the case isn't plastic. The case is a paper material (not unlike many other cds), so keep that in mind when storing it."
5,All Quicksand is amazing.,"This band is truly one of the grestest bands of the 90's. Every release from this outfit is memorable and ground breaking in my opinion. They are a band that others I believe, have used as a format in thier own musical structure. Often imitated but never recreated, this band has a sound all thier own. This release is no excecption. Heavy post hardcore(if thats what you want to call it) that utilizes new and refreshing dynamics in that genre. Walters vocals are unlike any I've ever heard, still to this day. He manages to sing with a style all his own and it just adds to the overall uniqueness of the group. If you're in bands like the Deftones and even Linkin Park then this is right up your alley, except they totally were on that musical tip way before those acts. Manic is a monster of a record and will surly stand the test of time.CurtisTimeFlies7@hotmail.com"
2,Yawn,"After a while, this didn't hold my interest at all. Nothing fresh or exciting. Just move along...."
3,Good Kayak chair,"This is a good kayak chair. Had to remove the 2 metal support bars on the seat bottom in order to allow it to fit in my kayak seat slot so that I could still access my center compartment. If the metal bars were made to be removed and re-inserted, it would have been perfect for my application."
5,Simply the best!,The quintessential rockin blues album. Simply his best work. I can't recommend it more highly.
3,Good fun,This shows what fun can be had with a pumpin and some carving tools. The results are a delight to all who see them.
3,"Good, tight fit, no improvement in sound","Well built quality product with a tight fit on the connectors. But I can't hear any difference to my old subwoofer cables. If you're looking for better base response, try moving your sub to a different location in the room or think about installing acoustic treatment (studio super chunks) - much better investment."
5,Great Stuff!,"No more cats on the counters! I don't even have to use the sound anymore hardly, they just see the can sitting there and don't even attempt to jump up. Kudos to whoever came up with this idea!"
5,Completely satisfied!,Great product! I keep myself stocked with this item! This keeps the landlord from knowing I have a cat as it keeps him away from the front door of my apartment!!!!
3,Entertaining cat training!,"Benefits: very entertaining to be relaxing in a part of the house well away from the kitchen where the StayAway resides, listening to the tone -- psssst -- thump of cats being trained to stay off the counter. No more shouting, lurking, scolding, spraying water, etc. to train the cats. The compressed air, apparently with just a bit of water seems safe. The product is easier to set up and maintain than ScatMat -- just turn it on and off with a little switch. It takes up very little counter space. Very effective and safe.Drawbacks: Quite expensive, in a multi-cat household (with very bad cats), it doesn't last long. Can't find refills -- I've been waiting months for refill order on Amazon to be fulfilled."
5,great tool,"While I haven't gotten really far into this book, I've so far found it to be amazingly helpful for trying to unlock the mysteries of why the French language can seem so convoluted at times. What this book does is to review English language grammar rules for those of us who have forgotten much of them, and then it compares side by side the same rules as they apply to French. It makes it so much simpler to understand than just throwing rules at you and telling you to remember them just because. I took this book to my beginning/intermediate French language class and the teacher said she was going to order a copy for herself! I think that speaks volumes! I think anyone who is serious about speaking French well and truly understanding it will benefit a lot from this book."
1,Terrible color display,"The Tao 89862 has a very poor quality color display. It must be held at the absolute correct angle or it is very distorted. Even when viewed full face the quality is minimal. The vertical lines are distracting and the color is not very bright. I have an older Tao that is so far superior in viewing quality but the battery will no longer take a charge. That's why I bought another Tao. If I could, I would return the new one in a heartbeat."
3,Works well with close-up photos.,"These are neat little gadgets that will hold a lot of pictures without having to carry a photo album around. It is also very easy to download photos onto it. However, the screen is very small and close-up photos work best. It is very hard to see detail on other photos. Also, when I go to show my pictures I sometimes find the battery has gone dead. It's easy to forget to charge the battery regularly."
4,Great Gift,"I gave this gift to my sister and she loves it, it is one of the best sizes screens I have seen in this small portable version. Its a fun and loving gift whereby latest photos can easily be uploaded. She already has a picture of her new puppy, us and friends on it. Also the best value for money out there - there are other versions but at higher prices or small screens."
3,What do you expect!!??,"I think this is a great little gift! The pictures are as good as my phone camera and it is just fun to share a hint of your pictures with others. (I scrapbook so that is my main interest.) I got my daughter-in-law one and one for myself. Everyone I have shared it with thought it was cool. I do agree that it is a little pricey ....but when you're looking for a gift that is different, one splurges."
1,Misleading For Mac Users,"Sorry to be such a gloomy gus, but I have had major problems with this product. I have a PowerBook G4 which means a mini CD cannot be used. When I went to the Tao Electronics website, there was no sign of downloadable Mac drivers. The people who sold me this device took it upon themselves to send me the Windows drivers on full-sized CDs, so they are not the problem, in spite of themselves. The problem here lies squarely with the absence of customer support from Tao Electronics. Why can't their website just include every set of drivers for every single thing they have ever manufactured ever in the history of ever? What prevents them from doing this? Mumble mutter. As of this writing, I have a still-dormant keychain, and no way of making it work."
2,Overpriced and Cheaply made,"I was really excited when I discovered this digital photo keychain by Tao. I bought one for my cousin as a gift and bought an extra one for myself. For 50 bucks a pop I was expecting something pretty high quality, but I am disappointed to find that the image quality is very poor. Even if you do crop the photos to fit the screen the images appear striated and pixelated. Since I know that the cost of disk memory is getting pretty cheap, and cost of a small LCD screen like this one cannot be that high, I feel like I've been ripped off. If I had known what I was getting, I wouldn't have paid more than $20."
1,Waste of time,"Anybody who read mainstream business publications (such as Business Week, WSJ, etc) will know as much, or more, then the author about Internet strategies and e-commerce. The only reason I finished the book was because it was the only one I brought for a recent intercontinental flight."
2,Don't waste your money.,"If you want to see a movie with super close-up, black and white scenes of pro surfers talking about surfing, buy this. If you want to see pro surfers doing a lot of surfing, buy something else."
5,Replacement part is exact like original,Replacement part is exact like the original. Broke the original part needed a new one. Went to Cusinart web site found nothing. Leave it to Amazon to have it. Thanks Amazon!
3,problems with original replacement work bowl,"please STATE in your comments that you need to buy this part when you replace the large sleeve, cover and work bowl, for an older cuisinart. Works fine now. Just a hassel as took 4 times to order ALL parts necessary to make work bowl purchase a complete package."
3,The info was usable.,This book gave some decent information on making your own scout from different mil-surp rifles. I felt it just needed more illustrations when he was fabricating his own scout mounts. Also sling usage pics would have helped. Overall though I think this is worth purchasing if you are serious about making a scout rifle.
4,Helps you learn how deep to dig.,"Very good book with actual price estimates from the people who know best, RS Means (we use their database at work (Facilities area) for estimating."
2,They got frustrated,"All I here in this third album by Catherine Wheel is a bunch of frustration in trying to be something that they are not. If you want to here the REAL Catherine Wheel greatness, buy Ferment and leave it at that!"
1,Educating Emily,"Soft adult movie. Mix of sex and supposed comedy. The usual sex movie, silly, and very boring after the first 10 minutes. Spend your money on another movie."
3,"Solid writing, great information","This book is a good introduction to the life of Dietrich Bonhoeffer. FOr those who have never been in contact with Bonhoeffer, the writers give a good overview. For those who have already had some contact, they will find some useful information and good insight into his life. It doesn't give the depth of detail that Eberhard Bethpage gives but it does help to understand a man of deep faith and strong conviction. I highly recommend this book."
4,Wonderfully illustrated and written,A good tool to reinforce proper alignment and utilization of the strength and ease necessary for each poise. Well written
3,Good but it is a little whiny.,Terri Clark may not be the best singer out there of country music but I still think this debut album isn't to bad. Better things to do is really what you buy it for and a couple of other songs are pretty good the best stuff is at the beginning but let me tell you it can really give you a headache after a while especially if you have headphones on. Terri Clark in alot of her songs has alot of overly hard country twang and some of her songs are a little whiny where the words are extra long. Its not horrible but her next couple of albums got better but mostly all are Terri Clark material.
1,Weird,"This was a weird movie. Typically I'm pretty open to movies like this, but the romance wasn't romantic in the least, and the whole premise of the movie was just bizarre. And the ending was stupid. Thank goodness it was free on Prime."
2,If I Had Known..,"If I had known that the red car would arrive already defective, I wouldn't have bothered to buy the set. The silver car runs well, but the red car's magnet is glued in incorrectly, which causes the car to drag and stick. It also has faulty strips which prevent it from moving forward. Even with the turbo boost button, the car still doesn't work properly. Overall, not a great product for the money."
1,Horrible! Don't Waste Your Money,"I would give this 0 stars if I could. I remember playing with similar race track sets with my dad when I was little. Only then, the sets cost alot less & the cars actually worked! I bought this Carrera set for my sons for Christmas. We have yet to get both cars to go around the track once without one or both flying off. They get stuck, go off track & fly off constantly. Not worth the hassle & not fun at all. This will end up going back in the box. If only I had read these reviews before purchasing it, I would have saved some money. Unfortunately, I ordered it from another toy site that didn't have reviews on it."
3,Excellent toy -- but requires patience,"I agree with IceManTX. This is an excellent toy. Although I purchased it for my 6 year old daugther for her birthday, her 8 year old and 5 year old sisters love it as well. No dobut that it is a difficult skill to learn to control the speed of the car. But that IS THE FUN of it all. It DOES require patience to try over and over. I didn't buy this because it's educational, but it really will teach patience and persistence. Just like real driving you DO HAVE to slow down on the corners.Given that the cars DO fly off the tracks (and that's a blast as well) they hold up incredibly well considering the fly onto our hardwood floor EVERY time. Overall it's a great toy and great value as a package. If I could do one thing different it would be to buy a four track version so all of the girls could race at once (ok 5 tracks so I can race too!)."
4,Traffic Light Duel Slot Car Set,"My 6 year old loved it!! It took him a little while to learn how to control the speed so that he wouldn't 'crash', but once he got it he has really enjoyed it. I've also enjoyed racing with him. The cars go really fast and the loop d loops are fun...I didn't know this before but you can add on to these tracks and make them longer with more turns and banks...GREAT TOY!! Wouldn't reccomend for less than 6y."
4,Great Race Set For My Kids,"I purchased this race set for my sons, who are both five (twins). It took about a couple of days for them to get the hang of it, but once they did, they couldn't get enough of it. The track and cars are pretty durable, the track holds together pretty well, and the cars stay on the track pretty well with practice.After about three days of use, one of the cars has shown a decrease in performance and requires use of the turbo button to get great speeds. Of course, that is the car that I now use when racing with them. Also, the support strips, which help hold the track pieces together, become worn on the curved tracks and lose their ability to grab the track. However, these are minor problems and I have plans to buy additional cars and support strips. Overall, I'd give this set five stars if it weren't for the car and support strip problems."
5,Notes from the original producer...,"Master Cylinder is a great record and brings nice memories to my mind... still obscure even to the indie aficionados and it's a shame because there are lots of ideas and creativity in it! Brilliant engineering too by Drew Canulette (of Lollapalooza, Nirvana & Soundgarden fame)... It's really unbelievable sometimes knowing that no guitars were used in the recording, all string sounds are made by electric basses, except for a brief banjo part. The moving vocal performances were made by a young Elaine di Falco during a cold and they're GREAT! The percussion parts by Henry Franzoni often use polyrhythms in a song context, very unusual at the time. Influences range from Conlon Nancarrow to Black Sabbath, from grunge to prog!Excellent musical quality here but... what a financial disaster! - Alessandro Monti, producer"
3,Majors always serves the reader a crispy read!,"4 Guys and Trouble afforded the reader the opportunity to get comfortable with many different types of love. A Man Most Worthy explores success. Billy Dee Williams said it best when he told Diana Ross in Mahogany ""success is nothing if you can't share it with the one you love.""Seven years ago John Sebastian allowed the women he love to walk out of his life, now he wants her back. Josephine is married and living her life while burying the hurt and pain of her past.Winning Josephine back, will prove to be quite taxing.A Man Most Worthy is definitely worthy of praise and recommendation.Missy"
3,Got to represent Major!,"Now for any of you who have come across any of my reviews. It is quite obvious that I only review books that strike me. I am an avid fan of major, and though this novel might not be on the top of my best list books, I am still compelled to make a review, for I strongly am in love with Marcus's story telling technique. He has a very distinct way of creating true to life characters that stay with you long after the book is finished, and for that a man most worth deserves to be read. You will confronted by characters who share great friendships, but each longing for that special kind of love. With just a hint of drama to help turn those pages, I am certain that ""A Man Most Worthy"" will prove to be a satisfying read!"
3,Look nice - OK deal if 50% off or more,"These look nice, but I got a blister on my achilles tendon (heel area seemed stiff and was digging into my tendon) after wearing them a day. Sole seems kind of rigid and plasticky. Maybe they will break in but I find I am avoiding wearing them. They seem more cheaply made than other Sketchers I own."
2,Definitely not the definitive Audrey biography . . .,"Overly obsessive about her weight, marred with factual errors, and written awkwardly, this book is not the greatest biography of Audrey Hepburn. Her own family protested the introduction which states that Audrey helped the author with the book. It does include some gorgeous photographs, though."
3,Amazon Instant Video-The Perfect Theater Alternative,"Amazon Instant Video released this preview before it will be shown in theaters. With the high cost of theater visits, I was able to view this new release from the comfort of own home."
4,This is a great DVD player!,"We got this last December for my 3 year old. We haven't had any problems with it. It's super easy to use and does the job to entertain our little one. The only thing I have an issue with is lately it seems to be a little temperamental about opening to put a disc in. I seem to have to push it a couple of times. But then again, there has been a 3 year old playing with it. I actually bought mine from Sears and purchased an extended warranty for two years and I still have time to go in case I want to switch it out for a new one. BUT, I wish I could have gotten mine for as cheap as Target is selling it!! =o}"
1,Sent the wrong item,"The product itself is fine, I'm sure. The problem is I ordered a *1 port* Single Gang wall plate. What I received was a 3 port wall plate. That left me with the option of returning it (not worth my time or money) or going to the local hardware store to find blanks to put in the other two holes. It's frustrating to receive an item incorrectly, especially an item that only costs a few dollars to begin with, because when it's wrong, it costs more money out of your pocket to make it right than it does to just buy another one."
1,Tech,"This is my second XL bag. The bag is smaller and all the tool pockets are shorter. For a bag that is a XL this is a problem. The back tools hang out over the front ones and, well I think this was a bad change."
5,XL veto pro pac,BEST TOOL BAG OUT THERE for taking tools to the site and for storing at home. You'll not regret this one!
2,Good things always come to an end,"Elton is a great artist, a real one. He made fantastic album in the 70'sand in the 80's, but good things never last forever. I think he did great stuff but his star has faded. This album isn't great but Elton still is."
1,MAC users beware!!!!!,"If you order this book to study last minute BEWARE!!!!.I was sent a book with a WIN only CD-Rom and it cost me study time getting a MAC/WIN CD-Rom resent. The book I recieved had a number on it to have a MAC CD sent, but office hours are M-F business hours. BE SURE TO HAVE THE ORDERS DEPT HAND CHECK FOR THE MAC/WIN CD, if you are an apple user, so you don't get stuck like I did. The book is made with either the WIN only or MAC/Win CD according to Kaplan."
4,Wonderful Knight,I loved this book. The author's descriptions were so vivid I felt as though I could have been there. The chemistry between Donall and Isolde was intense and very believable. I highly recommend this book and the author' s previous release Devil In A Kilt.
3,.,"I'll give this 3 stars just to be kind to Dostoyevsky, an author I love dearly, but The Gambler is by far the least satisfying, least engaging, and least interesting book by him that I have read. The first half of the book is interesting, but the last half of the book seems rushed, awkward, and unrealized. I put the book down feeling a bit dumbfounded, and certainly let down. If you love Dostoyevsky you should probably give it a read at some point, but personally I would not say it is of pressing importance."
5,Human desperation dissected,"A compelling tale of compulsion, addiction, and general base desperate grasping. And - oddly enough - it seems to me that the editor missed a couple of plot points that could have been wrapped up. According to accounts, though - the story was written in a great hurry, as all Dostevsky's royalties were wagered on it - which provides a beautiful backstory to keep in the back of your mind as you read."
4,Place your bets,"Written in narrative style, Alexey Ivanovitch is a young tutor working for a minor Russian aristocrat, aka the General. The book takes us back to a bygone time when the aristocrats of Europe never worked a day in their life, but rather journey about in an endless cycle of idle amusements - often including gambling. As the rich and titled enjoy their favorite pastime at a German casino, we watch the dysfunctional Russian family, either love sick or somewhat mentally unstable and sometimes both, testing their luck on the gaming tables - often with amazing consequences. An unusual, slightly demented and always amusing tale of a time period that is gone forever."
3,Okay,"I wouldn't say this is one of the best books I've ever had. It provides very little information, half of the information discussed in class is not in the book. This could be much better."
1,worst!!!,"I ordered this book for my communications class, I was supposed to get it on Feb.16 but til this day I still havent gotten it. I got my money refunded but now I had to go buy the book at the book store which costs me a lot more."
5,Great album from a talented group,"Wet Wet Wet (strange name), is a tuly talented group. These guys from Scotland not only play their own instruments, but also wrote all but one song on this album. They also produced the album too. And Marti Pellow has a voice to die for! Every song here is a great song...no filler at all. And the 20 page booklet is great...contains all the lyrics, plus tons of pop art paintings, which makes for a very colourful booklet. I would be very hard pressed to pick a favourite song from this album. If you like well written, intelligent pop, then this is for you."
5,Wow! Great Brownie Recipes,"My sister brought this book home from the library and it looked wonderful, so I made up the Kahlua brownies right away. Can you say Fab-u-lous! Since we had to return the book to the library, I bought the book so as never to be more than an hour away from a brownie treat.The next batch of brownies I made (cream cheese layered) were better than the first batch. This book is a solid home run. If you love brownies, you will love this book."
2,Disappointing,"My kids love the DS and I thought this would be a great addition. The padded cases they had worked better to protect the game itself. This one has no strap to secure it in place when the box is closed and it kind of bangs around in there. As for the ""game case"" to hold the $30-40 chips....what a joke. It's a chunk of plastic, no way to secure them within the case and it doesn't have room for NEARLY enough. How about something to hold these things separately from each other and securely. Car adaptor was the only plus as far as I am concerned."
2,Ehh....,"This is the first volume in the series that I've purchased and probably the last. I Figured I'd give it a chance at a quick glance at the store. It features some reputable artisits such as Ferry Corsten, Armin, Paul Van and Tiesto. However, it also features some of their not-so-hot remixes. There's no real muscle to it. The only song I actually enjoyed was Angel, by Jezper Sonderlund."
1,very poor indeed,"I recently took this book on a trip to British Columbia. No idea why I bought it (except that I thought Lonely Planet put out decent guides), but this book was of far less value than the freebee tourist bureau handouts that one finds along the way. I'm absolutely certain that the authors did not visit any of the locations, as they provide no insights at all into the destinations, and their recommendations seemed outdated and sketchy at best. Bottom line is, I left it at a hotel because I didn't think it was worth the weight or effort to carry it around."
4,On My Top Ten List This Year,"The Sabbathday River was highly entertaining and engrossing. It was hard to put down as the mystery of the dead babies began to unravel. I found the characters both likeable and believeable and especially enjoyed the depiction of the hypocrisy and puritan attitudes of the small New England town. The book also does a great job showing what can happen when one gives herself up completely to another only to discover what complete betrayal feels like. The father of Heather's baby is one you definitely love to hate, even though she doesn't seem to realize just what a ""creep"" he is like the reader does!! The only part of the book that ""bogged me down"" a bit was the characters trying to come to terms with their Jewish heritage and religious beliefs. This was hard for me to incorporate into the whole ""scheme of things"" of the story. Even though I had figured out the ""mystery"" of the ""river baby"" long before the book ended, it was still a great read and I highly recommend it."
4,The Sabbathday River runs deep & bloody,"I rarely get all lathered up about a situation in a whodunit, however, ""The Sabbathday River"" crowd got to me. I mean I wanted to wade right in & start changing things; retorting to the local wicked witches' foul mouths; exposing the handsome handyman; getting in the face of the coercive constabulary. Jogging outside Goddard, New Hampshire, Naomi Roth finds a dead baby floating in the river. The news spreads quickly & Naomi, a former VISTA volunteer & founder of the local women's quilting co-op, is shocked when the community fingers as the prime suspect, a young single mother notorious for her affair with a married man. Fascinating read! For my full review please go to: ( )"
2,short lasting life,Have went through several pairs and Lycra doesn't last long. Less than 4 months. Too bad that they can't come up with something that you get your moneys worth...Bought my last pair...
5,Don't miss out!,"This songwriting genius has the voice to match. The first time I heard this CD was about 5 years ago,just before seeing her perform at a small club in Boston,MA;it has been absolutely my favorite since. No matter what your mood,I listen to Kim when I'm up,when I'm down... ALWAYS my ""you can make it"" music on a really long drive. Let This CD make your day!"
5,Ohio Boys always kept a groove.,"The JB's were always the backbone ofJames Brown's hard hitting lyrics. Everyone knows that a good song normally starts from the rhythm section, well James Brown's rhythm section was from Cincinnati, Ohio Bass player Boosty-Lead Bootys brother Catfish and Drummer Kash. Cincinnati had alot to do with most of James Brown's hits."
3,The Famous Flames,While I have the utmost respect musically for Mr Fred Wesleythe trombone and musical arranger for James Brown in a long timeand I strongly recommend his new book (HIT ME FRED!!!!!)to all those who like the Horn section in any given bandit seems to me that Pee Wee Ellis's Live Funky Cd its better.Also there is cd very rare in USA but easier to find in Europecalled BACK TO BASICS!!!with the same musicians.Last but no least the LIVE from Oakland of the Tower of Power is still unbeatable to this day!!
1,deceptive,"This link came up when I was sampling some LEDs which included free shipping. This vendor charged more for shipping than the bulb cost. I bought it anyway and found it can be purchased for considerably less including shipping. Also, it was not near as bright and clear as the other LEDs purchased."
4,Ushio & Tora 3 : Tora goes to Town,"If you like Takahashi's ""Inu Yasha"" manga you may like Ushio and Tora anime series! ADV films has a mature audiences/Parental Guidance for violence and strong language for these videos. I find them less offensive than the ""Halloween"" or ""Friday the 13th"" Movie series. I watched this in a subtitled format so strong language that you have to read loses a lot of the shock value. The character developement thruout this series remains strong and you get caught up in Ushio's Teenage friendship / romance / Love triangle. The violence was nicely balanced by the comedic scenes of Tora trying to cope with modern day city life. I would have gave this video five star for content. I took back a star for the high price."
2,In Volume 2,"A monster hunter from Hong Kong mistakes Tora for the monster who ate his family 15 years before. Ushio is in a moral dilemma. He knows that Tora was stuck in his basement for 500 years, but he doesn't know if he should just let the monster hunter kill Tora. Scorching Spinning Wheel features a monster who likes to live in spinning things. this particular monster has taken a shine to Asako, and Ushio must, in turn, save her from becoming this monsters consort."
4,A day in the life of Ivan Ivanovich...,"How did people live during Stalin's reign? This book does a fairly good job of explaining. Hardly an apologetic piece this book talks about nepotism, ""connections,"" cronyism and privilege which were the order of the day, as well as (misplaced) idealism and hero worship. It discusses how the ordinary person got by as well as how the growing class of Communist bureacrat justified their own existence within Soviet society. Societal attitudes and culture are also explored. Not an easy read and if your are not already fairly familiar with the state of affairs in the USSR at this time you will have difficulty following it at times. Still, an excellent book and well worth reading."
3,"Interesting stuff, but not a light summer read.","If you want to learn about Joseph Stalin, try something else. Surprisingly, Stalin is reduced to a bit player in this book; the real players here are the bureaucrats staking out their territory and enforcing their small visions of the ideal Soviet society, and ordinary citizens denouncing other citizens for the smallest of gains. Changes resulting from the occasional fiat from on high - although almost never from Stalin himself, who protected his cult of personality by speaking only in the most general of terms - are examined, but the real meat is the lasting damage done by peers and government lackies."
5,An Essential,"This CD is a must-have for any collection - it is much better than Clapton's newer hits release, ""The Clapton Chronicles."" ""The Cream of Clapton"" shows why Eric Clapton is a living legend.This CD spans Clapton's career from the '60's thru the early 80's. Every song is great - this is one of those CDs that one can play from start to finish. When you get it, skip ahead to track #11, ""Layla."" This song blows me away every time I hear it.Pick this up."
5,Fav Clapton Album,"I never really thought much of Eric Clapton. His obsession with the blues seems a little nutty to me, but some of his songs are quite good. This covers his ENTIRE career, which is very long. It includes songs from his late-60's blues/rock band Cream, then includes Layla, from his Derek And The Dominoes work. And it also includes 'Prescence Of The Lord' from his controversial band Blind Faith. Can U handle more? It also includes the best of his solo work, including 'Wonderful Tonight', 'Promises', and many others. If ya wanna get started on this guy, get this one."
5,A great album by a great artist.,"The only thing that detracts from this wonderful compilation album is the lack of any of 'Slow Hands' earlier work, but saying that it still embodies his greatest period with all his greatest hits, particularly Cocaine, White Room and of course the first version of Layla, although I must say after an early period of dislike I now appreciate his later version. Long Live Slow Hand. Mick Lenton Northampton England"
3,Very small ponies,"I knew these were smaller than the regular ponies, but I had no idea they were this small! They are only about 2 inches tall. My daughter got these for Christmas & really hasn't played with them at all. And the tins they come in are really about worthless. I'm thinking of throwing them away. We have the Celebration Castle & I keep a basket near it to store ponies & furniture in. The regular ponies have a magnetic foot so the tins are always stuck to the ponies. The tins also get bent really easy & that makes them hard to put back together. My advice, stick with the regular ponies."
4,"Tiny tins are TINY, but still fun","I was surprised at how small the tiny tins really were, and was a bit disappointed that the ponies are more like figurines than regular ponies. They don't have manes, other than painted on, and their heads move slightly, up and down. My daughter is too young to fully enjoy these now, but I can definitely see the day when these will make an excellent restaurant or trip toy. I would agree with another purchaser who said this set needs a small bag, as the parts are quickly spread across a room; 6 ponies, 6 tins, 2 pieces each tin. You can imagine how quickly all 18 pieces can drift far and wide. Some benefits; play can involve more than one child, and there is educational value in the matching of ponies to tins, and inside to outside tin pieces. Not quite what I expected, but still cute and clever."
5,wonderful product,"This basin is great. When your loved one can't get into the shower, it's hard to get their hair really clean, especially long hair. The drain can be a little tricky, but it's well worth it. Very nice design with the small pillow inside to support the head while you're washing their hair. The size is just right also. It got here faster than expected which is always nice!!"
2,wash basin,"this product has a great drain system. the head opening is way to tight, the seams in the plastic are at the opening to cut your ears and being so tight you cannot hear anything being said to you. if it is tight to keep the water from leaking then you shouldn't have that much water in it to begin with. i had to buy another wash basin that is open tray with a whole in the end that works much better. also the drain is a thin walled tubing that kinks and bends and wont allow draining. i will not recommend this product to any body."
1,Don't do it!,"I saw the mixed reviews and decided to risk it. I'm returning it. They give you drywall screws and anchors to hold the thing together. There were no instructions for assembly. It isn't hard to figure out what they want you to do however, you can't actually do it. The anchors don't fit in the metal tubes. While screwing in the first screw it became apparent that the anchor wasn't going to survive being squished so tight between the metal of the tube and the screw. Save yourself the hassle and find something else."
3,"Good quality, but unbalanced","The tray itself is very nice, and I like the mesh material that holds the papers. However, the ""legs"" were very unbalanced, causing the tray to wobble back and forth every time I tried to use it. I learned that it's possible to manipulate the tray so that it is level if you have a strong friend. ;)"
1,Ariived in open ripped box and was deffective,Stay away from this one. First time i'm leaving a bad review on Amazon. Item was open and defective and bent out of shape. Will return immediately.
1,Doesnt even sit flat,How hard is it to get something to sit flat on a flat surface? One of the legs is messed up so the tray rocks back and forth. I guess that's the workmanship you can expect for 10$.
5,Inspiring,This book has inspired me to always do the right thing and I feel I'm a better person after reading this book for the 12th time.
2,"A so, so story","Ok, nothing special, copied from a disney film, but well written and a page turner,I don't think I would read the next n the series.If you want an easy to read book, its ok but a little of every disney film you have seen."
5,A book of it's own kind,"Just imagine being forced to work under, as a slave of a secretive and quirky ranger.This is the very thing that occured in the life of Will the Ranger and wannabe knight.In the time of this book, the orphans under the baron's care had a special day, a choosing day,where their futures were decided.All the orphans got their desired choices except Will.Will was put under the care of the ranger,Halt, a mysterious old man who worked in a secret force of rangers who were, imour modern time, quite like secret police.Will spends the first day of his apprenticeship as the servant of Halt,as he helped with the house work and other duties.He became obediant to Halt and in the end,he became the unnoficial son of Halt.This whole story bases around life as an apprentice ranger,which is extremely interesting.I found this book very resolving and loved the end, which was satisfying and to me, definitely coplete.PS: I can't wait till i get the 2nd book!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,"When I grow up, I want to be just like Halt!","When i first saw this book, I was interested. Following my instincts I bought it, receiving a second copy for christmas.Young Will, after turning 15 along with his 'year mates'-other oprhans of the same age as him entrusted in the care of Lord Arland. He participates in his 'choosing'-picking a school to be educated under. Will wants to go to Battle school and become a knight of the realm, but his light build and small figure prevents him from joining any of the typical schools, until one night, the mysterious ranger, Halt, decides to take him on as an apprentice. Will is less than keen to become a ranger, a community of secretive people who use black magic to become invisible, or so it is said. When the realm is endangered by the evil lord Morgarath, Will's ranger training is put to the test.The next two books 'The Burning Bridge' and 'The Icebound Land' are just as good, and I'm looking forward to the next book."
4,Pretty Good,"I found this book to be quite good and would recommend not only to children, but to adults as well.This book is totally different from Harry Potter.The book is well-written and relatively fast moving. The book introduces us to Will, a child that was a ward of a baron who was selected by the Rangers, a mysterious group in the kingdom. We follow Will as he discovers what it is to be a Ranger and how he grows into the role of an apprentice to one."
4,"Deaf Daughter, Hearing Father: Would You Give Up Everything For Your Child?","I really enjoyed reading this book. The author and his wife turned their comfortable lives upside-down in order to provide the best possible life for their deaf child, moving from Canada to Northern California so that she could attend a school for the deaf in Fremont.Author Richard Medugno is also funny and endearing as he writes about his daughter's obsession with Britney Spears and his relief when she later becomes just as obsessed with the far more wholesome Olsen twins (from the TV sitcom Full House).The book also highlights the conflicts that still exist between those who insist that children born deaf should be taught to speak, and those who support the use of sign language."
3,Movies fine; Packaging not,"I won't comment on the movies since I assume you know what these movies are about or you wouldn't consider buying them.The problem I have with this item is that this is a pack of two ""normal"" Blu-ray packages shrink-wrapped into one. If you are a stickler for quality, then you will not like that when they shrink-wrap the outer wrap, they melt the inner plastic sleeves that hold the liners. It is not melted, per se, but all bubbly/wrinkly and looks terrible. I haven't decided whether to return these or not or to try and find some replacement cases. Most likely, I will not be able to return these anyway, except for the same item. The cases are also the very cheap kind with the locking flap.To sum up, the discs and movies are fine, but otherwise, the packaging is very unimpressive. They will likely be the rattiest-looking cases on your shelf."
1,"To short for standard 40"" holiday gift wrap","To short for standard 40"" holiday gift wrap. Most good quality holiday gift wrap is 40"" long and this fails to store that."
2,Interesting but a little confusing,I tried to read over this book but found it a sort of jumble of thoughts from other new age/Hindu type books. The continue stress on follow the leader within the pages made me aware of a guru to student obedience. This work I would guess could be useful if you want to anchor on the belief system expressed. Nothing really original from my view point but after all the book implies that the belief system expressed is not new but ancient and just being rediscovered.
5,Cookie,This was my daughters' favorite book while they were growing up. I can't wait to see my one daughter's face when she receives it as a gift for her first baby. I even bought a book for myself to keep at my home. The rhymes are classics and the illustrations are so eye catching. I try to purchase this book as a baby shower gift for my family and friends. I highly recommend this book.
5,A Favorite New Baby Gift,"This beautiful version of Mother Goose first came to my attention 39 years ago as a baby gift for my first child. The bright and clever illustrations capativated her attention as she enjoyed the traditional verses so familiar to many generations of children before her. The book became part of the bedtime ritual for our daughter and her two younger siblings, and we have passed it on as a favorite baby gift to family and countless friends. Because the illustrations feature animal characters, children of all backgrounds can identify with them. Richard Scarry has indeed provided the Best Mother Goose Ever."
3,50/50,"I bought the CD for the Song ""High School Nights"" by Dave Edmunds - very hard to come by. Other than that song, the first few songs are pretty good but the others are just plain cheesy which makes for a bizzare compilation. It's a very average comp. CD - plain and simple."
4,Better than could be expected,"Due to the people accompanying him, and because of Pete Townsends' nice gesture, this album is often overrated. It's not silly in the way that Oar of Madcap laughs are, but obviously Clapton was not in best shape.It's an emotional affair mostly and a curious artefact of the days that Clapton seemed lost. Also, it's actually better than his mellow studio albums of the 70's (with a reggae song on them).In conclusion: great live blues album by interesting band but not the best."
3,Needs some work,"When I bought this cd I expected a lot in return with E.C. teamed with Traffic.Needless to say I was let down.It does have some high points (Roll It Over and Pearly Queen), but overall the group's lack of practice combined with Clapton's lay-off are all too apparent."
4,Eric's sucessful comeback,"After 2 years mainly out of the public eye, Eric, with the help of some talented friends, staged this concert at The Rainbow on January 13 1975. This concert gave Clapton the proof that his friends and fans were still behind him, and became a turning point in his career. There really is no better way to hear Clapton, than live. And this disc has been digitally remastered with 8 tracks that were missing from the original issue. The sound is great, and you can almost feel like you are there. This is an album that every Clapton fan should own. And the 12 page booklet contains a 6 page essay and photos from the show."
3,A Non-Essential Musical Artifact,"While the ""Rainbow Concert"" marks Eric Clapton's comeback from drug addiction in the mid-1970s, it is for Clapton completists only (or fans of Blind Faith, due to Steve Winwood's prominent role here). While the song selection is superb, these live versions add no new revelations to the originals. And, like most live albums from the 1970s, primitive technology results in muddled sound quality (which is only slightly improved through remastering). Stick with E.C.'s studio recordings instead."
2,Disappointment,WowI was really shocked at the quality of this CD to say the leastI'm a moderate Clapton Fan and I've seen him live 4 times but this CD I'm afraid to say is no good
4,Good reference guide for the classic movie lover.,I just wish it included movies from the 60s and 70s as well. Otherwise very helpful.
4,Great book for discipline ideas,Although this is a great book overall - it's geared in some areas for kids aged 4 years and older. The nice thing is that you can learn these principles and apply them to a toddler and look back over them for furure use. It really makes you think about all the forms of discipline and correction and decide which is best for the given situation. It gives loving guidance for the manner in which you correct your child's behavior.
2,Le cruset,Just received my lecruset but not really happy cause the lid color is way to dark compare to the body as if it is different color.
5,Sesame Street Fiesta Songs,"I wanted to write this review b/c my purchase was based on an online review. This is the best CD! We are trying to learn and teach our 3 boys (3, 2 & 2) Spanish. I listen to Fiesta Songs in the van even when they aren't with me! We've learned so many useful words and phrases, and the music is great. Me gusta!!"
5,Absolutely fantasic,The Gear's have a wonderful way of writing that brings this book to life just like all the others in the series. This one hits home that ordinary people can do extraordinary things. I highly recommend this one for your bookshelf.
5,Love my Laptop,"Love my laptop it comes everywhere with me. Also, it suits my needs for instructing an online class. Cool purchase."
4,A good historical read,"I like history anyway, but when the history is in my back yard I like it even more. There are many tales of terror as you read through this book. Although published quite a while ago, it still is riviting to this day."
2,Only OK,"I bought this book while visiting Chicago and seeing Lake Michigan for the first time. The topic interested me, I found the book disappointing. The book has only a few not that great illustrations of some of the ill-fated ships and lacks basic illustrations such as a map of the Great Lakes. The book is divided into ship wreck stories about each of the Great Lakes and a final section on the Edmund Fitzgerald sinking. The stories aren't in any particular order, chronological or otherwise, and the author does not place them in any sort of context. It would be nice to know more about the geography and economies of the various Great Lakes, but there is not much on this. The author obviously had a great knowledge of Great Lakes shipping, but this book is written in a clunky style."
5,Shipwrecks,"Quite a comprehensive review of Great Lakes Shipwrecks, a topic I ventured into because of my ancestry from Milwaukee's 1860 U S Harbormaster Martin Dooley, who died in the USM Lady Elgin shipwreck of Sept 8, 1860, near Chicago.[...]The reference to Corktown in Old Milwaukee, might actually refer to a part of Old Detroit, and the reference to a ""shillalah brandishing mob..."" avenging the Lady Elgin....seems more like a Republican torch-bearing Wide Awake demonstration.William Henry Bishop, of Saint John Cathedral, like several other authors, minced few words in claiming that the Augusta had ""run down and sank the steamer Lady Elgin"", and as a result it was considered unsafe for the Augusta (later re-named Colonel Cook) to dock in Milwaukee, for many years.The illustrations of Reynold Weidenaar, show a greatly exagerated tsunami-like wave buffeting a ship, similar to an exagerated painting of the Lady Elgin."
4,A Spanish soap opera,"ACOMA provides romantic escapism that educates as well as entertains. The historic settings are obviously well-researched and rich with detail. The clash of Spanish and Indian cultures is painfully reflected in the lives of its characters, who give us a realistic glimpse of the hardships involved in adapting to new environments and mysterious customs.My only disappointment is the contrived deaths of so many of the central characters in the last chapters. While death came suddenly and early to pioneers, these multiple tragedies seemed unrealistic.Reading history was never this much fun in school. I even learned a little Spanish! I hope there's a sequel."
1,Total Garbage,"What a piece of junk. Save your money. It went in the garbage day one. Springs jammed down the tubes...Looked and felt flimsy and cheaply made. A total waste of money.Don't buy this item-& if it is representative of this company, beware!"
1,Zenith Space Saver,"Cheaply made. Insufficient space 6"" should be 8 1/2"" or 9"". Springs too stiff for what it is holding. Too hard to compress even 3""."
4,a great value,"a great value this bike is... i got a road bike because my friends started riding and i have a gas guzzling car so i figured some excercise and saving of money would be good for me. After doing some research online and at bike shops this was the cheapest bike with the best reviews that i could find (i dont need a $1500 speed demon) the set up was easy it took about half an hour. the only complaint i have is with the brakes. Im thinking of going to buy some better ones to replace these. there a little spongy and dont have the stopping power i'd like if im gonna be riding around town. Other than that though everything about this bike im extremely happy with, from the weight of the bike (about 20lbs.) to the gear shifting."
4,Nice Bike,"I received my bike today, it actually arrived a day early from what it was supposed to. My son put it together, he said it wasn't hard. I've already rode it...very nice. I also own a mountain bike. When I would ride my mountain bike, other bikers would pass me...the mountain bike is heavy. The Schwinn Katana is very light...about 20 lbs. The brakes and the gears need minor adjustment, but no big deal. It cruises very smoothly. I can pedal with the same strength as my mountain bike, but the Katana goes soooo much faster!It's very nice looking too. The only thing I didn't like was the handle bars were too low.I'm glad I made the purchase."
1,im a little p***ed!ripoff! bait and switch!dont buy!,"just opened the box and found a black bike as opposed to a gray one as shown that i wanted. the components are not shimano as shown and stated in the description. it came with no assembly instructions. so i basically got nothing i wanted because i didnt want a black bike that doesnt come with shimano components. i feel ripped off and duped and i want my money back! dont buy! maybe if i had ordered a black bike with some off brand components i would have gotten a gray bike with shimano components and some damn assembly instructions! dont buy! dont buy dont buy! did i say dont buy? because youre gonna get exactly what you didnt pay for. i knew i wasnt getting an expensive bike but at least send me what i bought. i dont think thats TOO much to ask being that im spending my money. dont buy this bike! dont buy this bike! even if you want to spend the same amount for an entry level bike, take your money elsewhere. bait and switch!"
1,Schwinn Katana Bike Review,"I would not recommend this bike. The gears do not work properly - when I change from low to high gear the chain will fall off completely. Also, the tires needed air added to them before every ride. I would suggest spending a couple of hundred dollars more and get a higher quality bike."
2,not satisfied at all,"I started spending on the bike to maintaine it since day one. I took it to the bike store when I received it to finish assembling it. Since it didn't come with any instruction's manual. After a week of using it, it started making noises and started to go out of balance. And for people that ride road bikes, they know how risky it is. I wish I spent more money and got a better bike than this shwinn Katana. Now the bike is back for the 3rd time at the bike store for maintenance. I already spent about $150 for maintenance and it's not even been a month from receiving it.I was expecting to have a manufacture warranty from Shwinn, but I never received anything with the bike that mentions that."
2,"Some good, Some bad, Some infuriatring!!!","Don't get me wrong there are some GREAT stories here such as ""Infliction"" and ""N007-JK1"" among a few others. My problem is that they are FAR out weighed by these horrible stories with ""mystery"" plots and endings that beg for you to 'figure them out' such as ""The Planting"", ""One Of Those Weeks"", ""All Hands"" and too many others. This type of story telling is usually just a gimmick to hide a weak story. There are times to use this device but when a story ends this way or has this type of plot the story should 1. have some clues to the plot and 2. have an interesting enough story for you to care. These stories have neither. This book was mostly a waste of time.Oh yeah, Stephen King's contribution; not bad, not great, but good enough to hold your interest and while not a strong story it's told with a master story teller's voice."
3,Average collection,"With the exception of the Stephen King story, nothing stays with the reader. Workman-like but that's all."
5,Perfect Function and Appealing to the Eye,"I have had this for over a year now, and love it. It feels great in the hand, and has a great look to it. Feels very solid. I may drill a small hole at the top of the handle to make it ""hangable"". If you are looking for a bar strainer, look no further. This is it. I examined the Oxo at a store, and just found it lacking the style this one possesses.Cheers!"
5,!!!amazing!!!,"Absolutely amazing band and they are really nice guys too. I met them back at Soulfest during the summer and they put on an astounding performance that was totally chaotic. This cd does not sound like other bands out there, they can get mashed up in the ""screamo"" category but it's more than that. Much more. All the band members are very in sync with one another and it shows. They all have a purpose, to make music and spread the word of Christ and I love it. Very well written lyrics also, they are very mature and it doesn't sound like they were written by a band and their debut cd. ACB has pretty passages, sometimes in the middle, or the end of a song that can be compared to 70's prog rock. All in all an amazing young group of musicians that knows what they are doing. ""Son, I Loved You at Your Darkest"" is one of the best debut albums that you will hear, I cannot wait until their next one comes out. Look for them at Warped Tour this year and Soulfest again."
2,Homecoming: Not my cup of tea,"I think that this book is not what I look for in books that I read. It is a book that keeps repeating the same things. I feel that Part one and Part two are too similar because all they do is wander until they find a place to go. I do feel that Cynthia Voight made up good characters and my favorates are Sammy and Maybeth. Sammy's stubborness is fun and help's add to the story. Maybeth is a complex character. She only speaks to immediate family and is thought to be retarded. She finally proves everyone wrong at the end of the book. I like her for that. I feel that this is not my favorite book, but it was well written."
4,Good Book!,"Homecoming was a really good book. At first I was so interested that the pages kept turning and then there was a boring part in the book. It picked up though. It was about the four kids who were left in a car while their Mom went into the mall. Then she disappereared and never came back. The kids decided to trip to Bridgeport which was their origanal destination with their mother anyway. They go through the adventure not knowing where they are going to sleep, eat, or have any money. When they finally get to their Aunt cilla's house in Bridgepot they find out that she has been dead for several weeks. They live with their cousin Eunice. Then they fnd out that they have a grandmother in Crisfeild. They go on another adventure to find the only family they know they have. They get their and have trouble with their grandmother but eventually cope with each other's needs. So overall it was a great book."
2,Homecoming,"The book Homecoming was not a very good book. It was interesting at times but not many. The author dragged on ideas and turned them boring. Also the author kept on telling how they were walking and how much money they spent exactly and that wasn't an important part of the book. The ending of the book was kind of boring and a disappointment. I think they should have went on to more adventures and the author should have stopped repeating herself. Lastly, I don't think that this book is very realistic because not many people would go on a train to a place that they barely know right away. I would recommend this book to you if you like reading very long repetitive books."
4,Greatest book I have ever read,"This is one of the GREATEST books. Put it in your MUST READ section. Great book. It has everything in it: Drama, Action, Adventure."
1,Worst Book,Homecoming is the worst book that I ever read. The book is streched out and the samethings happen over and over again. Maybe this book was only so bad because I read it in school over a 6 month period!
3,Homecoming,I thought this book was okay. I thought the book boring when they were walking for days and days and the same thing happened every day. I also didn't like the ending. I thought they should have met up with the mom in the mental institution. I wished they talked about the dad more since the only mentioned they he left them when they were young. I did like some of the adventures for example when they were tyring to excape from Mr. Rudyard.
3,Homecoming,"I think Homecoming was a very good book. Except for the fact traveling took so long. My favorite part was when Dicey met the grandmother. I think Cynthia Voigt described her characters very well. Everytime she said their names I got a clear picture, especially the grandmother. I wouldn't mind reading another one of her books, if the traveling wasn't as long."
4,need does not mean want,"In ""Homecoming"", Cynthia Voight tells the story of four siblings who are forced to fend for themselves, and survive together without getting caught by the police in fear of being placed in foster care. In the first chapter, the Tillermans are left by themselves by their near-crazy mother in the parking lot of a shopping mall, and after they realize their mother will not be coming back, they decide to make the long and hard trip to Bridgeport, CT by foot. Dicey the oldest child, must watch over her younger siblings, and always put them before herself. Many times in the book, the Tillermans have nothing to eat, no money, and no shelter. ""Homecoming"", shows you the real meaning of ""need"" and of ""want"", and shows you the power of love and where it can get you."
1,A trashy completly BORING book!,"I'm sorry, but this is one of the worst book I have ever read. Although some may find Dicey's commitment to her familiy heartwarming, and the ending a ""happily ever after"" one, but seriously, it was totally boring and pointless, and unbelieveable. I mean, do you think it is realistic for a 12 year old to tote along her 3 brothers and sisters for a week while treaking along a turnpike in New England, and live off of $8?! In addition, the while book seemed cheesey and fabricated! This book is a waste of your time, any redeeming qualities can be far out weighed by other much better books!"
4,One of My Favorites,"This is actually the account holder's granddaughter typing this review. (...)I absolutely adored this book. It is really deep for a teen fiction novel and I think Cynthia Voigt is an amazing writer. After reading this book, I had the urge to go and buy everything else in the series! I only rated it a four because of the time period. It's not very current, so the prospect of only having eleven dollars is a little unreal. If this story had occured today, they would have maybe had twenty or twenty-five. But, it was easy for me to convert their prices in to current-day ones. I reccomend it for girls and boys over the age of 11. Great book!"
5,It's addicting! You won't be able to put it down!,"Homecoming is marvelous book! After you read a few pages you feel you're there, standing right with Dicey, James, Maybeth, and Sammy. Cynthia Voigt did a great job describing the events that happened. You can understand what the characters are feeling and what they are going through! When the characters do something wrong you feel like yelling at them.This story will help you remember just how lucky you are"
2,Ummmmmmmmmmmmmmmm...,"I had to read this book for assigned summer reading. Besides the fact that I despise summer reading when many other schools have it as optional or writing instead, the book asn't completely horrible. The first half really, it was awful. It descibed everything way too much. I had to drive on rt. 1 and it gave me a headache because i heard it too much and i couldn't look out the window because i'd imagine seeing the suspicious looking kids walking along the road. And don't you think sum1 might get the tiniest bit suspicious of 4 kids walking along a HIGHWAY?? Wouldnt sum1 stop and see if they're ok??- The second half was better because they werent walking ALL THE TIME. Most of the time they got rides - at least after page 245.I love books but this one was terrible - and the ending is sooo predictable, I mean its called ""Homecoming"" for a reason... Anyway, more interesting stuff happens in the secong half. Other wise it just [stunk]."
3,are we there yet?,Sammy wasnt that cool. he always made a fool of himself and james fell off the rock. [...]. he was a pale color. that was FUNNY!
5,I got what I wanted out of the book.,"I wanted to quickly learn how to use the D200. Going area by area, the book explains all the different options, something about what the options do, and why you might want to pick one option over the other. In some areas I could have used more explination. I guess that is an acceptable tradeoff. Too detailed of coverage would have made the book too long. After reading the book I can now operate the D200."
5,Magic Lantern Guide: D200,"I purchased another ""D200"" guide and was very disappointed. Then I purchased the Magic Lantern Guide for the D200 and think it is one of the best guides available. There's so many options on the D200 and this guide helps to make you understand each. Especially helpful are the hints the author gives for the options. I've tried them and now have my camera set for some favorites Simon Stafford suggested. It is well worth the price, as another reviewer mentioned I will have it in my photo bag all the time."
2,We waited a long time for not a whole lot,"This book does a marginally better job of explaining the menus and functions than the manual that comes with the camera does. It does not offer any real world advice on how to get the most from the camera. You're still on your own. There are no recommendations, no examples of what features to use when, how to get the most from the camera in various shooting situations. It is just an slightly clearer extension of the camera manual. Only it costs about fifteen bucks and it took nearly a year to get printed after it was first listed on Amazon. The manual in the camera box is a.) included in the price of the camera and, b.) delivered on time.Save your money."
3,Update is Badly Flawed,"This refers to the 2006 version, updated to cover the 2005 WSOP. It seems like the update was really rushed, because they got some critical information plain wrong: the final hand of the Main Event. They got Hachem's hand right, but screwed up Dannenmann's hand and, more importantly, the flop! As a result their discussion of this hand makes no sense. Another indication of how much this was rushed: after several pages of describing the final table of the 2005 WSOP Main Event, at which Steve Dannenmann finished second, they turn to a short discussion of the 2005 Tournament of Champions and mention ""a burgeoning poker celebrity named Steve Dannenmann"" as if he's a new character being introduced for the first time. Sloppy editing."
4,Good collection,"No where does the book claim to be the complete collection of Nirvana lyrics. It clearly states on the jacket that the book includes ""a selection of B-side singles and a handful of rare tracks to round out the collection.""Most importantly, the lyrics are what they are. Words put together to make a picture. What that picture says to you, may be different than what was originally intended.A genius is no longer among us, and this book is a simple reminder of what once was is no more."
3,Don't want my funk stepped on,"This compilation has a number of songs that don't appear on other ""Best Of"" P-Funk CDs. That said, I just wish the sound quality was a tad better- the balance is off in places. Too much mid-range - the voice line occasionally sounds distant or even second-generation. The CD is handy for travel use, etc., but as a longtime funk fan, I want to hear the true, uncut funk. Sound-wise, there are better CDs out there. Maybe I just got a bad copy."
2,Washington's God,"A rather weak and limited instruction about the faith of ""the Father of America."" A childish read, this book severely lacks both in depth reasoning and supporting detail - leaving me quite unconvienced of the author's theories. Immaturely written. The author's research of Washington dosen't seem to have exceeded their initial elementary school teachings. A cute attempt though."
2,Conclusions are a stretch,"The authors want to believe so much that Washington was a Christian they stretch a lot of evidence, which weakens the book a great deal. Just because someone is in a room where the Nicene Creed is recited doesn't mean the person believes every word of it. Washington was more than a deist for sure, but simply using the word ""Providence"" many times in life doesn't make one a Christian. Perhaps Washington was, in his heart, a Unitarian, which is much different than a Christian. ""Providence"" can have a diverse range of meanings depending on the individual. I just don't get the obsession with making Washington something that he's not."
5,Move over Dr. Atkins...Dr. Kaplan has arrived,"This user-friendly guide to weight loss and healthful living is a wonderful read. Delightful anecdotes pepper this healthy stew, as Dr. Kaplan relates fascinating tales of guiding the country's wealthy and glamorous, as well as the everday reader, to fitter, healthier lives. The book may not get you famous, but it will take the inches off and put the smiles on. My smaller waist and increased self image are the proof. The chapters on alternative medicine were particularly useful, guiding the reader through the maze of alternative remedies and making sense of the myriad cures."
4,Condition as advertised,The seller did a great job on condition description and it was delivered in a timely manner. I love animals and this book is a well thought initial attempt into the emotional lives of animals. I would be curious to see where research is today on the subject as a lot of the views in this book are quite liberal and not fully found in evidence. That being said it is authors like this that dare to dream who give the analytical a window to find their assertions in evidence.
3,A review of the audiobook,"Strengths:""When Elephants Weep"" is full of moving anectdotes concerning animals and the possibility of them having emotions. It is a pleasant listen and usually not ""over the top"" in its preachiness. It was well read by narrator David Ackroyd. The authors make a compelling, if not scientifically rigorous argument for animal emotions.Weaknesses:The authors are continually preaching against scientists who do not believe that animals have emotions and may even doubt that animals can even feel pain. However, they rarely point out the scientists or the studies that espouse this view. It felt like a straw man argument after a while. They also fail to cite any work that backs their claims besides convincing rhetoric.In the end, it was a convincing, mostly entertaining book that was a lot more entertaining and pleasant than a PETA brochure, but without much more actual content than such a brochure."
4,Wow'ed,"Ok lets get one thing straight.....i am not usually into this type of music....I have since gotten tired of crap rock, manufactured BS that has nothing behind it. It all sounds the same to me. I heard Duality on the radio and was hooked on it, i sung the chorus all day long. So i bought the cd....blew me away, along with the harder stuff....acoustics? I couldnt belive me ears. Havent taken it out of my cd player yet, and a funny feeling not for a lond time"
2,slipknot what happened?????,"I love Slipknot but this album sucks!!!!! It's very weak. Iowa blows the doors off this crap! I have tried to listen to this cd many times and I just can't. Also, what's with all this re-mastered bull$hit??!! year 2005 and bands still have to re-master lame cds that they just released. HMMM? can you say rip-off?!!! make one damn cd then stop! Please! It's like bands that put out cd's with differnt covers. They think were all so dumb we will buy them all. Give me a break. Old slipknot rocks, but I hope this is the last cd like this........"
5,slipknot rocks!!!!,"ok i'm not really the biggest ""metal"" fan. However i am a maggot all the way to the core. I love every album slipknot has done. This one totally rocks!! I love every song on it, which is rare for me with any cd. The slower songs really show the vocal talent corey has. they are absolutely beautiful, yet still very slipknot. this album is so full of energy and feeling. Its their best yet."
1,Too Angry,"Well, if I could give this zero stars I proboly would. There really is no good songs on this, except Duality. I used to be a big time hard rock Slipknot fan, but it just is too angry for me. Maybe its because I listen to punk rock now, but its a little too angry. I read the lyrics to songs and they're nothing impressive. The first album was good, the second was better but the third sucked. It just sucked, and thats a nice way of puting it. How can you listen to music and call it worth-while if you can't even listen to it. Its too hard, all that Corey does is scream. In punk bands it's cool, but Corey sucks at it. He should ditch Slipknot and go back to Stone Sour. He is much better in that. Maybe its because you can actually hear his voice. Anyway, the cd is not worth 10 bucks. I would not recomed buying it ever. It just is well.............HORRID!"
3,I bought this to hear Slipknot not Stone Sour,This just simply sounds like a heavier version of Stone Sour. Corey no longer does his original scream but now more of a raspy yell. The only reason why I gave it 3 stars is because the music. The music is still really good but corey just ruins every song for me. The only song I really like is track 13 the virus of life. It reminds me sort of Prosthetics on there first one. His lyrics dont even effect me on this one. On the first 2 they made me want to tear down the world but now he makes me want to..turn off the cd. I onyl reccomend this cd for fans of stone sour or people who are just getting into slipknot and this is the first album they heard.
1,uninspired,"I'm not close minded to a band expanding there horizons, but this album is the exact opposite out that. It is completly uninspired and instantly forgettable. Previous Slipknot albums had both heavy and mello elements but they always inspired strong emotion. This album is conventional radio fodder. Most great bands put out at least one crap album, hopefully Slipknot got it out of they're system and they'll come back in a couple years and put out more great material."
1,WE ALL SAW IT COMING!!!,"WHEN STONE SOUR CAME BACK I KNEW THE RETURN OF SLIPKNOT WOULD BE DISAPPOINTING. AND BY GOD IT WAS MORE DISAPPOINTING THEN I THOUGHT. ACOUSTIC SLIPKNOT?? WHAT THE HELL? I THINK I REMEMBER THEM SAYING BACK IN THE 90'S THAT THEY WOULD NEVER SELL OUT AND CHANGE THEIR STYLE TO SELL RECORDS. WELL LIKE MOST OTHER BANDS (A.F.I., BLINK 182, NEW FOUND GLORY, METALLICA, KORN, LIMP BIZKIT, I COULD GO ON AND ON...) THEY DID. ITS SAD HOW MONEY AND POPULARITY WILL PUSH A BAND INTO GOING AGAINST THEIR VIEWS IN ORDER TO MAKE A DOLLAR."
4,"WHAT EVER HAPPENED TO THE ""GREAT BIG MOUTH""?","WHEN I FIRST BOUGHT THIS CD I WAS VERY EXCITED BECAUSE I HEARD ""DUALITY"" AND I FIGURED THIS CD WAS GOING TO HAVE MORE VOCAL TALENT BY COREY,BUT COME ON! THIS CD IS NOT ANYWHERE NEAR AS HEAVY AS THE PREVIOUS TWO. BUT AS A DEDICATED MAGGOT I AM NOT GOING TO BLAST THIS CD. THERE WERE SOME GREAT HEAVIER SONGS ON THE ALBUM( ""THE BLISTER EXISTS"",""THREE NIL"", ""DUALITY"",""OPIUM OF THE PEOPLE"", AND ""WELCOME""). BUT THEN THERE WERE SONGS THAT THE CD COULDVE DONE WITHOUT(""PRELUDE 3.0"",""CIRCLE"", ""VERMILION PT. 2 AND ESPESCIALLY ""DANGER-KEEP AWAY"".....THE WORST SONG ON THE ALBUM). I FALL ASLEEP EVERYTIME I HEAR ""CIRCLE"". THIS IS STILL A GOOD CD, BUT MY LEAST FAVORITE SLIPKNOT CD(SELF-TITLED BEING MY FAVORITE). I JUST HOPE THEIR FOURTH CD IS MUCH HEAVIER."
4,Great album from a growing band,"I have to admit that I always thought SLipknot was a gimmick band who screamed out lyrics that made no sense to fast and hard speed metal. With this album they have definitely changed my perception. From start to finish this album both rocks and flows. The lyrics actually make sense and flow well with their metal sound. They have grown as far as being musicians and we can only hope for even more in the future. So if you have never been a fan of Slipknot, now may be the time to start. This album is well worth the cash."
1,Disappointed,"I am a fan of Slipknot, and I must say that this album SUCKS! The only good song on it is Duality. I'm not sure what to say about why I feel this way.. It just doesn't do it for me!I'm sorry I bought it."
5,One word......great.,"This album is awesome. As if Slipknot could disappoint. Not like the other albums though...my wife even likes this one. Very heavy at times, but also mellow. Seems more technical than the past albums. Worth every penny you'll pay for it. Buy it!!"
5,Intimidating...,"I'll keep this simple. When I first listened to this CD, I was awestruck, then scared. I sing for a band called Crude Ocean and this style of metal is exactly what we are about to release. (Hence why so many people like our sound, it's very different...) It looks as if Slipknot kind of beat us to it.The blend between heaviness and samples with a thin accoustic lining making an unbelievable art form that can captivate you or make you demolish all the glass objects you own. Put it this way, this is some of the best art that has been released in the past couple years now for Metal. Once people stop thinking about the bands past records and really focus on what they have now created, I think a lot of people are going to realize how awesome it really is.I don't give it 5 Stars because I like the album, I give it five stars because it's truly nothing short of a masterpiece."
2,Trop relax,"Là j'ai de la misère à comprendre: Slipknot on épuisé leur talent après seulement 2 albums qui m'ont fait tout simplement jubiler pour en venir à un sorte de Stonesour. Le tout reste un peu aggressif, mais je m'attendais à de nouveaux riffs speedés et lourds. Je vous recommande de faire comme le cd de Limp Bizkit (aaaaark): achetez le premier album, point final."
1,The new slipknot,"If you are a Slipknot fan this cd is going to shock you. When i bought the cd i knew the music was going to be different but when i popped it into my cd player i was hearing something i never thought i would hear slipknot doing......acoustic. it was a huge shock Slipknot is one of the best bands ever if you want to get a Slipknot cd i suggest ""Iowa"" or their self titled cd ""Slipknot""."
4,All new all sides!,"Okay, so anybody out there who digs Slipknot and is looking at this, probably already owns this, but if you don't, DEFINITELY get it! This CD is a departure from previous albums of this band, but it retains all the previous elements that drew me into the band in the first place: Style, format, and surprises. This band continues to impress and grow beyond what I thought they were initially capable of- the only reason this CD is not a perfect score is (I feel) that there are a few weak tracks, that is to say, they don't contain quite the same polish as classic Slipknot. On another note, the CD's lyrics and acoustic (yes, four acoustic tracks!) are absolutely inspiring, and don'e seem silly or sold out even when performe by these masters of metal.CHECK IT OUT!!!"
3,Not Sell Outs but Skeletons of Slipknot,They did not sell out but they did fail. They just dont got it any more. Its over for them. They lost there way. No other way to put it. They have put out every thing they had with Slipknot And Iowa. They were never a real great band. They were real they were pissed they had attitude. Now thats gone.
3,Slipknot at their Worst,"Okay first of all I'm not a kid! Secondly, what happened to these guys. Their debut was absolutely amazing, Iowa was still heavy and dark and worth all of 5 stars. But this...this is not Slipknot. Where is the drowning percussion and chaotic guitars? An overall good cd, but not the Slipknot i love."
4,Not bad,"I see a trend in reviews that this is a hybrid album of Slipknot and Stone Sour; tracks 6, 8, and 11 (while not being bad songs, they're just not Slipknot) only help to encourage that belief. My personal problem with this album is that it sounds a little too close to Pantera; I like Pantera but I want Slipknot for its unforgiving brutality. It's even hard to tell on this album that there is a dj and a sampler present. Therefore, I must say I still favor the first two albums, but this one is quickly growing on me. The solos rule and Corey can still growl and scream with the best of them. It is a great shame that this might be their final album, but reviewers, please don't liken this to Metallica's ""Load"" - that's just wrong on so many levels. The black album was Metallica's sellout point, ""Load"" just proved that they lost it."
2,disappointing,Well let me start by saying I am a huge Slipknot fan but this is just not right. Slipknot was what made me love metal. The first two CD's were great. Chances are if you like Stone Sour you will love this but do not buy it and expect the same Slipknot that used to kick ass. 2 stars because of a couple average songs and a really nice cover.
2,Thing will never be the same,"Good day/evening , this cd was ok not good dj starstream(sid wilson) did not play in alot of the tracks there new masks suck and not once do they sing about themselves being heretic they sold out on this one. However that is not to say all its songs suck the nameless was pretty cool so was danger. You have to really be in to slipknot to actually buy this cd their best cd was their selftitled"
3,A general statement on volume 3,"Volume 3 SHOULD BE a very large dissappointment to a true ""maggot"". A few songs were extremely well done, including ""Vermilion"", ""Duality"", and ""The Blister Exists"". There were a few good surprises as well, including ""The Virus of Life"", and ""Danger-Keep Away"". But even if a few of the tracks are impressive, I feel like their next album should be called Volume 4, the obvious verses. Am I the only one who feels that this album was dissappointing? Maybe so, but as I said before, I'm a HUGE slipknot fan...the only word that came to mind from this album is baby language, YUCK."
4,Pretty good,"im not a fan or newer metal like korn or disturbed. it sucks. this is actually good though. they have realized their sound. good guitar, vocals, a little slower than their older stuff i guess though. I liked it, and im an old school thrasher (kreator,exodus,metallica,testament,etc.) and the farthest i go into death metal is death. Excellent record though. almost pure hardcore except for some acoustic sh*t."
1,Why did they even bother,This cd is even more horriable than the last two which i didnt even think was possiable. This is just anpther example of untaltend nu-metal garbage. They are so ashamed of their own main-stream targted music they have to wear masks. It takes like ten people to make this crap. Why waste your money? Why dont you stop being a wuss and buy some real metal.
5,Pearl Jam Killah,"All I got to say to the jerk off named Pearl Jam's Lion, or some sort of gay fixation like that; Pearl Jam SUCKS, Rage Against The Machine BLOWS, now you talk about cry babies and whining and bitching about nothing, Pearl Jam is your band.... BUT perhaps I just made your day Mr. Purveyor of musical tasste and self righteous fool. Ha you seem as if you know good music as if you know just what the hell you are talking about. Slipknot kicks major ass and anyone and everyone who doesn't like that fact should just go jump off a clif, yeah especially you.This Album Kicks ass and is far better than anything Pearl Jam, R.A.T.M., or any other band without musical talent, combined could do."
1,Rock music rules man,"What i don't get it, these guys make noise, incomprehensible noise pollution, stick it in a really ugly and frightening peice of album art, slap a $10.00 charge on it and call it music. This is pathetic this isn't music, look the word music up in a dictionary, I'm sure the words Melody, Rhythem and Tune will crop up. Maybe some one should point that out to slip knot or korn, or whoever the hell I'm writing this review on. If you can't sing, why form a band. If you can't play a musical instrument, why voulenteer to be the drummer? And if you don't like metal music, why write a review, i hear you say, well I'll enlighten you. Why do metal heads keep writing reviews for rap music they clearly don't like??"
1,Crap,"Don't waste your money on this shezit,spend your money on something from RELAPSE RECORDS if you want some REAL METAL."
3,VOL. 3: (THE SLEEPY TIME VERSES),"zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz...the new slipknot cd? can't stay awake long enough to listen to it all the way through... its just sooooo slow. even most of the heavier songs seem to be missing the angst that made slipknot stand out. sure they don't do acoustic TERRIBLY, but i don't buy slipknot cd's for acoustic songs. that's what folk music is for. i was not impressed with this disc, hopefully they'll bring back the death on the next cd..."
1,Why did i bother ?,"It's nu-metal...Need i say more ?Nothing realy new here but same old nu-metal type of way except slipknot turn staind on their fans because there isn't realy nothing heavy not one song like the early sh*tty slipknot always been! Mediocre bullsh*t--typical nu-metal start heavy and gets soft...Yup! Sell outs just like korn,lb,mudvayne,flaw,staind,deftones and the list goes on & on pathetic typical nu-metal!!Don't even bother."
1,slipknot sold out,"I hated this cd. I am a huge slipknot fan and hate talking bad about these gods of metal but I dont understand what happened. The lyrics were blah, the back up vocals were horrid, and coreys not even trying to scream anymore. All the ""heavy"" songs sound like bad punk music and all the soft songs while they show talent just arnt slipknot. Honestly this is just a poor stone sour rip off. If your a really fan you will hate it. Buy it used if you feel the need to buy it at all."
2,A differant side of slipknot.....,"I found it to be intresting that they took a differant approach to this album, but they have always said that every album would be diffrent from them. It is not as heavy as Iowa but it falls more as a mixture of stone sour and their first album. I truely was hoping it would of been like Iowa. This is not a heavy album so if that is what you are looking for than don't buy this album!!!"
2,Copying George Winston,"If Scott Davis want to put a George Winston arrangement on an album, He needs to get all the notes and syncopation right. Otherwise make your own arrangement."
5,Excellent Book,I can't imagine anyone not getting something out of this book. It will be considered a masterpiece for generations to come. A very tough book to put down. You'll want your highlighter and post it notes close by as page after page contains thoughts you'll want to remember or revisit.
3,"Poses a great question, but drags on and on","We read this book for book club and I enjoyed it for the first 1/3 of the book. I'm not the most ""worldly"" person out there, so I didn't know who most of the contributing writers were. The Sunflower story was incredibly powerful and question posed at the end really caused me to think. As I was reading the contributors opinions I found myself agreeing and thinking about things from a different perspective. However, the book just seemed to drag. It's my understanding that there were newly added perspectives to the original contributions. I wish that the editors would have selected a couple from the original contributors and then added the new perspectives. I think that it would have made the book more manageable. A lot of the contributors had similar opinions so that's where it dragged for me."
5,Art Theory in a paper back,"I'm just adding my two cents. This book helped me enormously. It doesn't matter what style you paint in, it covers the theory of 'the music' in line and form. I haven't read it in years and can still paraphrase many quotes.""Drink in all of the emotion that the painting gives you. How it moves you. Then you must analyze the how and why in 'cold blood'."" ""The eye does not see that which it is not on the look out for"". Harold tells you what that is.There are many excellent examples in the book. A reviewer complained that the images were not high res enough. The images ( aside from Speeds and his students) are all famous works of art that you can get much better versions of elsewhere. The value of the book is the very deep and thorough instruction from a great teacher."
5,"Very ""theory"" oriented but great read","If you're looking for a quick drawing book you can thumb through on the plane, this isn't it. However if you want a classical approach to drawing and painting theory, complete with very opinionated prose that teaches you the fundamentals of how drawing and painting should be - get this book. On a bookshelf filled with quick fixes and 30-second lessons on the go, Speed's drawing text is a welcome change. You'll read this again and again, gaining more knowledge out of it each time."
4,Fruit picker,"Wolf Garten Picker helps prevent fallen fruit and some bruising.as well as becoming tangled in the branches of the trees causing more fruit to fall.The use of the entension handle adds to ones ability to reach higher branches for many women, easier to navigate through the tree. The bag is a deterant to retrieving the fruit from the ground."
5,thoroughly enjoyable cd for the entire family!,Train songs that everyone in the entire family can enjoy regardless of age. Songs that span time and are wonderfully delivered by the immensely talented John Denver. An album to enjoy for many years to come for it's songs are ageless.
2,Not very good for typists,"If you are a hunt-and-pecker keyboardist than this keyboard will suit you just fine. However, if you are a regular typists and are used to typing on other standard keyboards then steer clear of this one. The biggest flaw here is the design and placement of the enter/return key. The key for the horizontal bar and slash has been moved down to the home row and sits right where your right-pinky would normally hit the enter key so inevitably instead of moving to the next line, you type a slash.You can find other brands of keyboards at a comparable price which do not contain this major design flaw."
5,Awesome Set!,"The hubby and I rarely can agree on what movies to get, but when we saw this we both jumped at the chance! I personally have always loved The Unspoken Truth ever since I first saw it (why aren't there more Lea Thompson movies!?!?!) and Prophet of Evil is one of his favorites so this was obviously the perfect buy. Neither of us had seen Sex Lies & Obsession or Darkness but we absolutely loved them. Four great movies for the price of one? I'll take it!! TREAT YOURSELF to this deal!!"
5,Cant wait!,If you loved the other 2 dvds by Andrea Lin you are really going to love this set. She has worked with so many celebrites. Her dance and teaching style is great.Dance a GoGo : Sexy Nightclub Workout
5,This is the best SF book I have read.,"This is the best written science fiction book that I have ever come across. I have made many of my friends read it, and they also enjoyed it greatly."
5,Unrealistic but marvelous,This is a romantic comedy that tickles your heart. Stories like this could never occur in real life but you cannot help basking in the joy of it. Without question this is Ginger Roger's greatist acting achievement. She is a 25 year old woman who passes for 12 and then later as her own mother at 50.
4,Zimmerman's title is dead-on!,"I was delighted to see a book written on the flight of Apollo 8. Zimmerman's title is dead-on. In the midst of the cold-war, and man's greatest technological achievement, God steals the show. As Frank Borman once said, ""the Genesis reading wasn't something that was hap-hazard, but God ordained."" I only wish Zimmerman could have focused more on the profoundness and the timing of the reading (ie. Christmas Eve), and how it changed lives (including some Controllers). The highlight of the Apollo program came not with ""One small step for man"" but ""In the beginning, God.."""
3,A Pleasant Survey of the Gambit,"In this book, the gambits are catalogued variation by variation, with assessments of playability and potential refutations. This is not an in-depth coverage of the gambits involved, but a light, surface volume. Keene's style is, as ever, pleasant, and yet the work is a tad surface for anything other than perhaps a quick look at potential odd blitz weapons one might face."
3,"top darts, well worth forking out for","Good selection of solid jazz tunes/songs. Sone are slightly annoying, like 'see see rider' but most are worth listening to."
3,"Fascinating content, but very poor picture quality","The fascinating content of this book is marred considerably by the extremely bleached-out picture quality on some pages. Other pages are fine, but it's nearly impossible to see any details of certain toys at all. Particularly bad are the sections showing the plastic soldier/farm-type playsets.Type quality is good throughout, however, and the content is exactly what I was hoping to see. Certainly takes me back to happy times. I would give this book 5 stars if the pictures were more legible."
4,how to make a telescope,"I'm sorry, this is my first review. How could amazon fail to give a good synopsys of this book? Anything by texereau is pretty much a definitive work on telescope making and mirror making. He gives good explanations, gives the math behind stuff. He also gives the best explanations of how to polish and parabolize a mirror that i have seen. Before you buy Ingalls book buy this one."
5,Happy grandson!,"My granson is thrilled with his fishing pole, and my fisherman husband is very impressed with its usefullness and performance."
3,Recommended for collectors only,"An interesting piece, but definately inferior to ""A Junkie's Christmas,"" from ""Spare Ass Annie."" If you're a Burroughs or Cobain collector, this is worth having. Otherwise, skip this & go for ""Spare Ass Annie"" or ""Dead City Radio."""
5,"This Ain't Your Typical ""Night Before Christmas""","A very dark and grim story, the narration is perfectly interpreted by Kurt Cobain's harsh guitar. The music seems to express what's going on inside the heart of the priest in this story. Especially incredible is the junkie priest's death as we seem to hear his soul spiral out of this world into oblivion. A haunting story for Christmas and an incredible performance by Cobain. Highly Recommended - ""Meltdowner"""
1,Don't let the reviews fool you,"I bough this vise from Amazon (thank Got so I can return it) few days ago and didn't mind paying a bit more to get something good (there are some plastic ones for about half the price).The built quality is awful, they didn't even bother to smooth out the sharp edges and corners after machining.If this thing was well built and aligned,they didn't need to put such a heavy spring in it and operation would have been much smoother.Other observation:IMO the bottom part of the pegs where the watch suppose to seat should have been larger."
1,Was this made by a blind man??,"This looks like a 1st graders project gone bad.. very poorly made. Not worth a dime ,look else where. The holes looked like they were drilled by a blind man."
4,Good Handycam,"Merits:1. It's a Sony! (Brand value).2. Compact and light-weight.3. Carl Zeiss lens.4. hard disk memory, easy to transfer to computer.5. I got the refurbished one from sonystyle.com for 300 bucks. Thats pretty cheap for a 40x zoom HDD camcorder from sony.6. Motion picture quality is good.Demerits:1. Does not have a view finder.2. The Still picture quality is not that great (As indicated by others too).3. Does not have a neck strap (Or any provision for that).4. You need the camcorder dock to charge as well as transfer movies into Computer.5. The bundled video editor doe not have much functionality. Only you can cut a video, i could not find any option to merge several videos into one.Overall i like this camcorder, i will buy some video editing software to work on the videos a bit."
4,Worth it,"Its a good camera, but would've been better if it had a longer battery backup. One has to spend money on another battery to keep it going beyond 120 mins"
1,Poorly written,"Having taken some objective interest in the writings of Larouche in the early 90's, I know how completely distorted and dishonest this book is. You can argue with reason for or against many of Larouche's platforms on political economy. This book makes no attempt to do so. You can certainly take exception to Larouche's conspiracy theories, but his predictions of global financial chaos seem oddly prescient in 1998. Anybody seeking a sound understanding of Larouche should read some his economic and philosophical works, before passing judgement based a trashy rant like this."
1,Intelligence community smear job,"Since King takes some quotations from LaRouche's writings, he knows the true context of them which he butchers. What can you expect from an author who began extolling drugs for ""High Times"" and is now lauded by the ""New York Times"", etc!!!"
4,Good-looking watch!,"The watch is great-looking and has a great face. Very much like the band made of rubber. It's very masculine-looking, and over-all, am very pleased with it!"
4,Interesting read for a fan of the show,"If your a fan of The Westwing and don't have all the time in the world to cruise the web for every minor detail about the show or individual episodes, then this would be a good book for you. It has alot of minor trivia that you would not neccesarily know as a casual fan."
1,Only useful if you don't want to watch an episode,I don't understand the previous two reviewers. Most of the text consists of a precis of what happens in each episode. If you've just watched the episode you get either nothing from the text or if you're lucky a single extra piece of information.These additional bits of information are not worth buying the book for.
5,Citizen Men's Calibre 5700 Watch #AT1000-50E,"I've had this watch for about 3 1/2 months and wear it on a daily basis. The case size is perfect and the band looks very nice. The glass is very difficult to scratch. The case is as easy to scratch as any other watch. My watch has taken some serious hits to the glass and nothing has happened, not even a scratch. Eco-drive technology is amazing, a little card came with my watch explaining how it works in simplicity which was quite informative. As far as technical problems I have had none with this watch thus far. I've had many people who consider themselves watch enthusiasts comment on how beautiful this watch is. These are people who wear Tag Heuer and Omega. If your looking for a beautiful looking durable watch for which you'll never have to change the battery buy this watch and you definitely won't be disappointed."
3,A-OK (Triple Point Score)!,"Amazon was MORE than willing to take the game back and apologized for the erroneous info but I loaded the game anyway and discovered it works on XP fine but only if I am playing Maven--for some reason when trying to download the patch to play on-line thru MSN Gaming Zone, the download won't take--that didn't matter and the game is fun enough as is but I'd like to see a XP version for Maven and on-line play come out soon!"
2,"a great pirate at first, an improbable secret and a really boring heroine","I bought this book based on the reviews. After reading this book, though I was so disappointed. DJ the pirate starts out sounding wonderful--Dark, dangerous and foreign. Then they get stranded on the island and welcome to boring. The pirate who before slayed a dozen men seems to go soft. He can't even deal with one whining artistocrat male. The heroine (who is supposed to be innocent) gets naked way too fast and after many pages not a whole lot happens. I don't get the previous reviews. If you want a swashbuckler, this is not it. Go for ""a pirate of her own"" or the ""Pirate Prince"". Both were excellent. This book in contrast was, odd, slow and the dialog was just painful at time."
4,D and P: Advancement of Learning,"This tv show pretty much follows the sequences of the book. However, there are some dry spots in the book that are confusing and seem to be off the track of the murder and more involved in the personnels personal issues. Had I not watched the tv show I would have been a little lost and some the details. Ellie is introduced for the first time, even though her and Pascoe had known each other in the past and she's not really a nice person, I really like the TV's ""Ellie"" better than the book charactor. Hopefully this will change."
2,I Enjoy Weinbaum; This Collection Makes Me Angry,"First, I want to say that I enjoy classic SF. I enjoy Weinbaum. The stories in this collection are quite enjoyable. They are: ""A Martian Odyssey,"" ""Dawn of Flame,"" ""Proteus Island,"" ""Pygmalian's Spectacles,"" ""The Circle of Zero,"" ""The Ideal,"" ""The Point of View,"" ""The Worlds of If,"" and ""Valley of Dreams.""Second, I'm very annoyed by this collection. It's offered by Halcyon Classic Series, which also offers the Kindle book ""A Martian Odyssey and Other Works by Stanley G. Weinbaum""--WHICH HAS THE EXACT SAME CONTENT. I bought this book AFTER reading that one because I wanted to read more Weinbaum. I foolishly assumed that the two books would have different content; I mean, they have different titles.I'm very annoyed at Halcyon Classics, and I doubt I'll be buying any more of their books."
1,One Who Walks Away,"A test of your gullibility, a testament of gullibility.This story is an elaboration of typical spiritual snake oil.Here's the summary:Person can't cope, tries traditional remedies, they don't help.Looks around for a guru and, big surprise, finds one.Guru sends self absorbed person on a quest, with vague instructions, such that, no matter what happens, the guru looks wise.Seeker endures a lifestyle change, and some discomfort, and eyes are `opened' to the `truth.'Now seeker is qualified to be your guru, cycle continues.If you want to read first person pronouns, I and me, until you choke, this is the book for you.If you want to believe a ridiculous tale of drug induced delusion, silly rituals (like rubbing an egg over your body to remove toxins) this is the book for you.If you are weary of childish voodoo, skip it.If it was possible, I would rate it no stars, but Amazon doesn't allow that choice."
5,It is one of the best!,"This book gives fierce competition to Pierre Clostermann's ""The Big Show"" as the greatest fighter pilot biography ever written.It's evocative, emotional, conclusive. Larry Forrester did a masterful job."
3,It's ok,"The first few times I tried this it didn't hold my daughter's attention at all. ( I bought it at 6 mos) She watched the fish move for a few seconds and went on to something else. There really is nothing for her to hold on to, that lights up or makes noise so it doesn't seem to amuse her for long. I do think that this is a toy that requires supervision. My daughter does like to bury her face in the plastic. I could see that being a risk of suffocation if you left your child unattended. Weeks later I pulled this toy out again and she batted at the fish for a few minutes. It remains to be seen whether she will grow to like this toy more as she gets older. I would say that there are probably better toys on the market for your money."
1,Not Safe,These water play mats are not safe. Babies can put their face on the mat and suffocate. Even though it looks cute it is a big hazard. If you are going to purchase a playmat buy one that does not have water.
3,"Ideas -- Some Good, Some Wrong","This book is a summary of techniques taken from the mentat wiki. While skimming a sample of hacks from each section, I discovered some less-than-scientific ideas. So, I went to the URL and tracked some of the links. I discovered that some of the links were legitimate links to peer-reviewed wikis, like Wikipedia. However, the contents of mentat do not appear to be peer-reviewed. For example, one link was to an interpretation of a research project which contained the researcher's comment that the site did not correctly interpret his research. Also, some links were to commercial web sites. So, the mentat content is simply a collection of individual opinions about different subjects. Therefore, as always, the hacks in this book should be evaluated with a critical mind. Some of the ideas are legitimate; some are simply extensions of long-held myths; some could be self-motivated trivia."
4,Good read,"Certainly the book is retaining, but most of the material in it you can find online.I mean only a few stuff were new to me, since I read about these a lot."
4,Brave lady,"Based solely on a repeat broadcast of a radio interview with Margaret Salinger and Michael Enright on the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation this morning, I would certainly give her book a good rating."
2,She shouldn't have published this,"This book reads like something a person would write in anger, then destroy. Too bad it got published. I can't imagine betraying my own father like this. The writing is not that good, and at times I was embarrased to be reading it. You won't learn anything about Salinger that you would want to know. And we must remember that this is only one person's side of the story. Maybe if Salinger had kept publishing, we wouldn't be so desperate for some kind of contact with him, and then this sad memoir wouldn't have gotten printed."
2,the price alone brings it down,"this is not worth 60 bux. this is not worth 40 bux. this is worth 30 dollars maximum. the material is pretty good, but it does not have ""in our hands"" and two very tedious cds of the brodsky quartet.oh, and when you have a cd called ""beats,"" there better be some ... beats. and this fell way short.a bit of a dissappointment, mainly because of the price and i was expecting a LOT more from someone so ridiculously talented. but it turned out to be the stupidest purchase of 2002 for me.also, the packaging is IMPOSSIBLE for the 3 inch disks. it's more annoying than you think."
5,A Must Have For All Bjork Fans,"This is a great collection to start with if you are just getting into Bjork's music, or if you have everything else she has done. I had this collection in the middle of collecting her music, I would have bought the Family Tree anyway, because I love all of Bjork's music. I highly recommend this set to everyone because it has lots of great selections. From Icelandic to English she is great. Buy this collection and you'll be listening to Bjork for a while, you will not be disappointed."
2,whereabouts are known,"some of the art in this book are nice examples of work by outsider artists, but this book is not very informative. every work of art is made by someone known to the authors. how is that unsigned and unknown. every piece is attributed to an artist and lent by someone. this is very confusing to a person new to the field of outsider art, and to those who are familiar with it. i think outsider art needs someone to write about it who has a brain. that is probably why when i try to get my friends interested in this kind of art, they always say it is so bad. the art is not all bad, but the people who do the books about it are not qualified to write about anything. i have no art qualifications whatsoever, maybe i need to become an outsider art ""scholar"". i may be overqualified. established art forms would not stand for this."
1,Without soul!,"Does he play Beethoven at all? If you like Beethoven piano concerto, please listen to Backhaus, Schnabel, Fischer or Perahia!"
4,Wonderful Movie,"This is a wonderful, romantic and family-friendly movie about the real power of true love. Yes, it's predictable - there's never any doubt about the final outcome - but it's very well written, acted, and believable. And it portrays a love that's much closer to the real thing than what passes for love in most ""romantic"" movies these days."
5,Magic of Ordinary Days DVD,I watched this movie on a classic channel and it was sweet. I had to add to my collection. I had a hard time locating it and was happy to find it here on Amazon. It was shipped out really fast and in great condition.
2,Unfortunately Dull,"A fascinating setting marred by dull characterizations and a tiredly familiar rpg-cliche storyline make this book a profound disappointment. Silverheart is an ode to the typically unusual Moorcockian genre with none of the charm or the lyricism that infects the pages of an actual Moorcock novel. One gets the idea while ploughing through the pages that Moorcock's contribution to the book consisted solely of a few notes scrawled on the back of a napkin, giving the finished product the necessary decor yet none of the necessary structure.Fortunately, its publication is immediately followed by a true-written Moorcock novel, ""The White Wolf's Son""."
2,product arrived defective,"no fragile sign was put on the box it shipped in. Outer container was cracked. Inner containers have lids which do not form a tight seal. I have 2 other sets like this which I bought in Crate and Barrel a while back. Their lids were fine. These containers come with instructions that say that they are good from freezer to fridge to microwave. You just have to be smart enough to know that you must wait a while before placing the container from one location to another. If not you will wind up with a useless cracked container. I have used them in the oven, fridge and freezer but have been afraid to nuke in them because the glass is not thick like other glass containers that I have bought exclusively for microwave to freezer to fridge. For sure these are much healthier than using a plastic container of any kind!"
1,They crack!,"My square dish cracked in the microwave the very first time I placed it in there - they are NOT microwave safe, despite what they say. NO BUENO!!"
4,To sum it all up,"I was a little unsure about these when I purchased them. A couple of the faces look a little funny in the photos and I was concerned they'd look unnatural in person. But when they arrived all the princesses look fine. Sometimes the faces can look distorted and alien but these ones look fine. They're very big though. I guess if I had done the math and really thought about it I would have realized they'd be so big but not expecting it, it was a bit of a surprise. It's nearly 7 inches up and down (15 feet long) so the people are a little over 4 inches tall. But it's pretty standard border size and looks fine. It just looked different at first because I wasn't expecting it. Looks great and we're very excited about them."
2,Indistinct indie,2 1/2This quality of output will impress only if low expectations are a starting point.
4,splendid exotica of pop sounds.,"4 and 1/2 stars. what an accomplished outfit of musicians. highly creative, their sound is all over the place: spaghetti western overtones here, acoustic ballads, r & b overtones, trippy hippy vibes, even a dash of jazz and so much more. splendid stuff. some might say that they try too much in the way of styles here, but i find it all fine. great to have a wide variety of sound all on one disc. hope they keep it going for years to come."
5,Adventure and romance of the highest order,"Watching a 'devil-may-care' William Holden hacking his way through the jungle is reminisent of his turn in ""River Kwai""! Here he struggles with divided loyalties among lovers, friends and politicians. With good-looking capable actors,lush exotic location photography, a haunting musical score and equal amounts of suspense,action and romance this one is a winner - lambasted by critics with no regard for the masses ""The Seventh Dawn"" remains one of my all-time ""guilty pleasures""."
2,Go with the Freud instead,"I purchaced this set of dados mainly b/c of price and the few good reiviews on amazon. However, when I used them for the first time I found out why this set is so cheap. I put on the two out side blades to make a 1/4'' dado and sure enouph it was 1/4''. But the kicker was that there was a groove on each outside edge of the dado bottom. It was not quite as bad as dadoing with a rip blade but it was close. I guess you get what pay for. However for only a few dollars more I bought the Freud set and while there was still a groove this one was minuscule compared with the Avenger set."
5,The best prophetic book of the bible.,If you want to know where a lot of the prophetic verses of the bible are that relate both to the first coming of our Lord Jesus Christ as well as His second coming then study the book of Isaiah. This book is rich in history which leads to a lot of the understanding of what is happening all over the world today in many countries. Even unbelievers can gain knowledge from this book if they are willing to really study it. The life change series of study books of the bible is the best series in my opinion no matter what book you wish to study.
5,Excellent study guide,"This is an excellent study guide. It will describe things that you would not notice by simply reading the Bible. If you want a better understanding of the book of Isaiah, this is a good book to own."
4,WORKS GREAT.,"Works well with the wii and wii u. If you want to transfer game data. But it's only 2 GB, so keep that in mind. Other than that it works."
5,Panasonic Iron NI-A56R,I love this iron. I sew and quilt a lot and this iron has been wonderful. It gets really hot when I need it to and the steam is perfect. Once I started using this iron and told others about it they all bought them too and have been very happy with them. I now have 4 of this model of irons because I take them to quilting retreats for all the ladies to use. The retractable cords make them store well in a cubbard and easy to travel with. I have been sewing for 22 years (and using an iron all the time) and I highly reccommend them.
3,This Rat Has Teeth!,"What a relief to read The Stainless Steel Rat Wants You after the disappointing Stainless Steel Rat in Hell! What a difference fifteen years can make!This Stainless Steel Rat is the Rat we all fell in love with - biting sarcasm, acerbic wit, the lapses in attention that land him in trouble, the daring escapes from that trouble, and a plot that moves briskly at all times, always staying a half step ahead of the reader. Just under 150 pages, it is just the right length; short enough to be read in one sitting, but long enough to draw the reader in.The only downside to this one is the packaging. Contrary to the title and cover propaganda, the Rat does no recruiting (beyond his lovely yet dangerous wife and the twins). A better title would have been, The Stainless Steel Rat: Bug-eyed Alien Sex Goddess. Read the book and you'll see what I mean."
4,excellent,"If you did not know the title, you would not know you were listening to a Malcolm X tribute. This is a big band, live, playing fantastic uptown swinging urban bluesBut look at the sleeve and listen again and it hits home. The big live sound of this matched with the cover invokes, 1965--all kinds of under and above ground civil rights activities, stern men walking in black overcoats and black fedoras. All long before my time,. but this gives you a visceral sense of that long ago Harlem.See Mr X on the cover--people just don't look that way now.This is live and unmixed and sounds like it was recorded with an overhang mic in a big hall, normally this would be a complaint, but for what this is, it actually adds to the nuance and mystery."
3,Pieces too lengthy and ambient for a 'best of'.,"'Greatest Hits' compilations are purposeful for those who don't want 'the whole piece'.This cd has too many long and ambient versions to be suitable for beginners to Brahms.Alot of his outstanding moments are 'blended in', rather than 'stood out'.So his melodic element is missed on some selections.But there are stand-outs.This Hungarian Dance n.5 is the most extravagent version i've heard.The tempo-changes are clever, and the orchestra packs a gypsy punch.A couple of the chamber works are great (tho u can find similar to those versions on many brahms' best of's).I find the melody of 'lullaby' is a bit lost in how very slowly it's done.Most 'Brahms' Greatest Hits' do focus more heavily on his orchestral pieces.This one also does, so I feel theres too few of his great chamber (trio/4tet/5tet) themes."
4,Good remake,"The characters are well played, and the storyline is decent. The acting is a bit shakey at times, but the rest of the film make up for it very well."
3,Good,"It is a slow movie, but how wrong can you get when you have stalwarts like Del Toro and Hopkins? I liked the girl too, she had had that sad, ,teary, tragic mask on from start to finish and it is actually quite apt given the plot of this movie. Overall, fair watch, if not remarkable or a must-watch. Sort of between average and fair. I would say, you may watch this movie over several days and the pace quickens in the second half. I didn't find the gory scenes gory - the creature has a penchant for plucking out the intestines off his victims - but some people might ."
1,B-movie horror flick,"I can't say I was expecting much from this movie, but Wolfman disappointed. It comes across as a B-monster movie rather than something more. The focus is definitely on a monster killing people. The movie goes to pains to find odd and grotesque situations in which to disembowel a lot of people. However, this gets pretty boring. The scenes are uniformly dark and the acting dull. Simon Merrells is catatonic and Anthony Hopkins comes across as a joke. The only ray of light is Emily Blunt, who manages to look even sexier in 19th century wardrobe."
1,To put it gently...HORRIBLE! Waste of time and talent!,"Emily Blunt is the only good thing about this film. I knew I was in trouble when I saw that costume! I am not a Tweenie fan but in truth New Moon Special Effects blow this film away. That said, there is NOTHING special about this film! Benicio seems as if he is bored the entire film and would rather be doing something, anything else! Hopkins is just angry! Perhaps that he was stuck in this role? LOL! There is NO story, NO plot.**Spoilers**Benicio comes home after his Brother is murdered and becomes a werewolf and Emily Blunt kills him and you will laugh out loud at his death scene!! I just did for you what I wish someone had done for me. Saved you the agony of this pathetic remake. Rewatch Traffic for Benicio and any of Hopkins films and save your money!Pure waste of time and talent by what could have been an awesome film with two awesome actors! AVOID!"
2,Kinda just boring.,"I was surprised by how boring this was. It wasn't tense or scary, the special effects weren't particularly good, and the acting was subpar for almost every character. The only touch of life is Hugo Weaving, and those few scenes are so short that you'll barely have time to register interest. If you're going to watch this, be sure to rent, and even then you should probably wait for a sale weekend when it's about a buck."
4,Very powerful,"This movie I thought was a very powerful movie. Madeleine Stowe was very captivating. The movie in itself may have seemed boring to most, but if you look past there only being two people in the movie with one set, the movie was quite watchable. Alan Rickman although being the interigator was very screen worthy in this movie. The scene where he was more than 2 people was amazingly well done. The movie in itself although disturbing in one level is a very interesting movie. I recomend it to anyone. To most people this is a disturbing film. It was for me. But it is worth watching. I give it 4 stars"
4,clear and informative,"While this subject may be very boring, this book is clear and concise and walks the reader through the development of modern mathematics. It isn't exactly chronological and instead chooses to follow a subject based time line. A solid purchase for those students who have utterly confusing professors."
4,very good base line,This book is very good base line to direct you into each aspect of the feild in which you need to srudy. It does not go into great depth with every detail but does have questions and answers in the book which are very usefully. I believe this is a great starting tool when starting to study for CIT.
3,Nice Shelf,"Nice looking shelf unit, but make sure you're studs are 16"" on center and you don't have any outlets beneath it. Unfortunately, I had to return it because of this."
4,Good compilation for casual U2 fans,"I must admit that I am not very fond of U2. Personally I think they are overrated however I do think the band does have some really good songs. Most of those songs I like are before ""Achtung Baby"". In my case, I didn't want to go and get all of U2's earlier albums so instead I opted for their best of collection. Other than ""Sweetest Thing"" and ""Bad"", I love all of the songs on this cd."
5,U2 ROCKS,I HAVE ALWAYS LOVED U2 WHO ARE AMONGST THE BEST IRISH ROCK BANDS AFTER TASTE AND THIN LIZZY.THEY MADE SEVERAL EXCELLENT ALBUMS LIKE JOSHUA TREE.THIS COMPILATION FEATUES THE BEST FROM THEIR EIGHTIES ALBUMS.BUY IT.
2,Are these guys broke or something?,"Why on earth did they put this album out? This album is called ""The Best of 1980-1990""? A more appropriate title would be ""The Most Overplayed of 1980-1990"". Sure, there are a few great songs on this album, but wouldn't you think that anyone who likes U2 already owns ""The Joshua Tree"" and ""Unforgettable Fire""? Was there really any need to put ""Desire"" or ""When Love Comes to Town"" on another disc? They weren't that great the first time around. The members of U2 should be ashamed of themselves."
5,Excelente compilacion,"Este disco compilatorio que recorre la carrera de U2 desde 1980 hasta 1990 (1988, en realidad). Estan casi todos los exitos principales del grupo como ""Pride"", ""With or without you"", ""I will follow"", ""I still haven't found what I'm looking for"", entre muchos temas. Quizas las grandes ausencias sean ""Gloria"", ""Two hearts beat as one"", ""Bullet the blue sky"" y quizas ""A sort of homecoming"". Quizas tambien ""When love comes to town"", podria no haber estado en este compilario. Pero de todas maneras, una gran compilacion, principalmente para los que quieren conocer a U2."
4,"great band, great album, great music",A must have for any fan of U2. This timeless band has consistently put out great music over the years and on this disc you can capture all of their earlier hits. Great album for those looking to add U2 to their collection.
2,Buy the Original Albums Instead,"How could they put out a best of U2 without ""GLORIA""? I wish they would release the original recordings and not monkey around with them. Just like the best of the Police album, this collection is almost unlistenable to long time, passionate U2 fans. Buy the original albums instead."
3,good songs bad sound quality,"I bought this cd with the new Limp Biskit album. Obviously these are very different bands. LB's cd had crisp clear sound with good bass, while the U2 cd sounded flat and monotone. Whoever did the sound engineering should be fired. Except for the last two songs, I thought I was listening to a cassette player. I have a rather expensive stereo system and was very disappointed with this quality. At a time where high quality MP3 and MP4 music competes with traditional CD music, they should be doing more to make the CDs alternative look attractive.As for the songs, they're the same old songs that are overplayed on the radio except for a couple that are pretty bad. I don't know why I bought it, it didn't even have ONE on it. I wonder why!"
2,(...),"I bought this while in (...) Spain thinking ""bonus"" meant the B sides (...) I think the ""B sides"" one didn't cost that much more. The extra track was ""October,"" a beautiful song but it doesn't make the CD a special find. It's also lacking great songs like ""Two Hearts Beat as One"" and ""Out of Control."""
1,"Terrible quality, but good Amazon seller","These drill bits bend easily. The vendor took them back, so I'd buy from them again."
5,An excellent guide to understanding intimacy in relationship,"We all find ourselves baffled by the repeat patterns of our lives,and these are most thoroughly reflected by our intimate partners.These moments can trigger a tremendous amount of confusion,anger,despair -and certainly loss of contact with our partner. The Moseleys's book isa clear and concise primer on why we do what we do in relationship.They mine what's underground many of our emotional choices and suggestmany useful changes that turn what repeatedly hurts us into liberatingchoices that feed us. A wonderful book!"
4,Eye-opener!,"I was introduced to the Moseley's work and book over 7 years ago. They opened my eyes to the patterns that live in us all. Those powerful patterns appear to pursue us relentlessly and many of them do not have our best intentions at heart! Getting acquainted with them moved my life forward , even to writing my own book which I called THE NAKED THERAPIST. The Moseley's work got me there! Thank you. And I recommend this book for those courageous enough to face life on life's terms."
5,A Wonderful Gift,This was a gift for my boyfriend for Christmas and he loves it. The shipping was very fast. I was very pleased with the service.
4,Great read even after college,I've kept this book even after completing undergrad almost two years ago. For any media enthusiast I would recommend buying and keeping this book for years to come. You'll always have a reason to look back for an in depth understanding of the basics of journalism and the media as a whole.
4,not sure if it works but my hair feels thicker.,havent seen any growth or noticable differences but its does feel a bit healthier. could be in my head though.
3,No difference,"After using it, I feel it has no differences with the one bought in $7. It is not worth the price."
5,Great Reader Source for Someone Traveling to Israel!,"I liked this book. I am so glad I was able to locate it on Amazon.com. A group from my church are going to Israel soon and I bought this with the idea of getting a more personal review of what life may have been like, when Jesus of Nazareth lived there. Now, I am passing it around for others who are going, to see! Thanks, again. Jane"
3,TITLE ABIT MISLEADING..............,"ALTHOUGH THIS BOOK IS A GOOD READ;ITS CONTENTS ARE GREATLY OUT OF DATE.....AND DISPITE ITS TITLE;........NOTHING IS FOR SALE AND MOST ""SECRETS"" ARE BY NOW --WELL-KNOWN.....STILL A GOOD READ;....FOR YOUNG, UP AND COMING SPIES."
5,An absorbing and gritty story from page 1.,"This is one of those relatively rare true-life dramas that reads a lot like fiction without any loss to the quality of the storyline. If you have the stomach to learn the ""down-and-dirty"" of the chaotic and bloody underworld of narcotics, you will probably find this book one of the very best reads at your disposal.This story is definitely not the Godfather. There is no attempt to glorify the characters - just a straightforward description of characters as the author experienced them. The cast is mostly a ragtag (but filthy rich) bunch of ever-changing drug smugglers (both Colombian and American) whose methods and personalities could be called comic at times, brutal at others, but always real.The book jacket describes it all, and the book delivers. This is the first book in a long time that's kept me up late at night reading."
5,Biscoff,These cookies have a very unique flavor. I made Christmas treat bags for friends and they loved them. My family highly recommend them.
3,cookies delicious,"I love these cookies, but many of them are broken. Although I could use the cookie crumbs in recipes, it would have been much nicer had they not had so many broken pieces."
4,Disc 1 - tremendous Disc 2 - disappointing,Had the producers elected to include different albeit less popular selections on disc 2 then the compilation could have been absolutely masterful.If you're at all a fan of 70's funk then this one is required but there's enough uninteresting material to bring down the overall rating.
4,great little light,This is a nice little light. My main reason for the purchase was for a night reading light but I have found it much more useful. It is a clever design and it is comfortable and easy to carry around.
3,Delta cast iron extension wing,"Was rather disapointed in the accuracy of Delta's extension wing. I thought I was ""up-grading"" to a Delta saw. With the wing tightened onto the table top, the top as a whole was not flat. This is perhaps not that unusual but the disappointing aspect was that the manual gave no instruction whatsoever as to how to correct this. My old Grizzly did."
5,Wolfe's finest novel.,"Peace is not a book for everyone. It is best left to experienced readers who are eager to look between the lines. Casual readers will be frustrated by this novel, as with much of Wolfe's work.This book is a masterpiece deserving a place next to the works of Dickens, Hemingway, and Melville. Like other fine literature, it is a work which should be savored with multiple readings. Like many of Wolfe's works, Peace is a horror story in disguise. If you're not paying close attention, you may not notice the mystery haunting this book.I can assure you that while much of the book may not seem to make sense at first, everything does add up. What appears random is not. The pieces of the puzzle are scattered across the various unfinished stories in the novel. One story's beginning must serve as another's end. Characters masquerade across different stories. If you give up, as some reviewers apparently have, you can always search the internet for answers to this book's many riddles."
2,Not to happy,"Chopin is okay, but his pian music doens't appeal to me that much. I prefer Mozart's piano music. Chopin's wasn't mood suiting because to me most it is flat."
3,Keith Urban Song on Album,"Keith Urban and Vernon Rust wrote ""Jesus Gets Jealous of Santa Claus"", a great song on this wonderful Toby Keith Christmas. Very original, and Toby pens such great songs himself on this album."
5,A terrific holiday album.,"If you're a fan of Toby Keith or even a country music fan, you must have this CD! On this album, instead of having Christmas tunes everybody has heard before, Toby uses original holiday music. ""Hot Rod Sleigh"" is a funny song about how Santa has a new, fast hot rod sleigh to keep up with all the children. ""Christmas Rock"" and ""Santa's Gonna Take It All Back"" are also fun! ""Santa, I'm Right Here,"" which is about a homeless family living on the street, is touching. ""Bethlehem in Birmingham"" is very sweet and so are ""Jesus Gets Jealous of Santa Claus"" and ""All I Want for Christmas.""All of the songs on ""Christmas To Christmas"" are wonderful! It's truly one of my favorite holiday albums of all-time. Toby Keith is a great singer and songwriter and it shows on this record. I highly recommend it!"
3,Find a place to purchase the two or three worthwhile songs,"Like a lot of Christmas albums released by ""flavor of the month"" entertainers, this disc really only contains two or three songs that stand out, the rest, not so hot. A real Toby Keith fan might disagree, but then again a real Toby Keith fan is probably not a Christmas music shopper. I'd recommend Santa I'm Right Here, Santa's Gonna Take It All Back, and a couple others, but that's hardly worth the price of the full disc."
3,Surprisingly Bland,"I find this a pleasant group effort, but to my ears the music wanders, lacking the focused solid groove featured on many Coleman Hawkins recordings. Very egalitarian of him to let all the band members solo, but Hawk is silent while that goes on. Idries Sulieman blowing a single trumpet note for a full minute is not my idea of great music.I'm a big fan of Coleman Hawkins, but I sold my copy of ""Flies"". Some of my favorite Hawk:Retrospective (1929-1963)for a good overview of His early work,Coleman Hawkins Encounters Ben Websterfor a compellingly romantic session, andNight Hawkfor an exciting session with another protege, Eddie Lockjaw Davis."
4,Well presented and an eye-opening perspective,"Surprisingly candid perspective on the Caucasian American. This was purchased as a text for a course in Communicating Across Cultures an its a keeper. I have not completed the book, but I am 'meeting' an array of writers from a range of era through the 1900's.You can sit down and plow through, but I am enjoying a small grouping of 'chapters' each time I open it. Then taking some time to consider i just read before taking on another chunk.Don't expect a book full of anti-white man rants...but a series of snapshots that show us how American culture has not shone their brightest in response to a supposed racial superiority."
4,"Great compilation of singles, spanning their whole career.","This album is one that had to be made. Absolutely an indispensible addition to any Tears for Fears fan. It is entirely comprised of singles they made from as far back as the early eighties to present, songs which never made it onto their albums. While most of the songs I like, there are a few so-so ones, but the good ones definitely outweigh them. One song that comes to mind that stood out as my favorite is ""Sea Song"", it's short but sweet with all that simple charm that could only come from them. I highly recommend this album, especially if you're as big of fan of Tears for Fears as I am."
2,Cannot work on a multi-line system,"I purchased this unit plus the additional microphones and it is a great unit with a good price. We haven't even used it but are returning it! None of the literature on this site explains that it will work on a single phone line. We have analog lines so that was not an issue. However like any business, we have multiple lines. And, this unit cannot work on a multi-line system. It worked fine when I hooked to our fax line. But NO dial tone when hooked to any other phone jack in our building."
2,Typing errors,"I have been reading the 1999 editions and I hoped that new editions have shown up. This book is very concise and clear. However, typing errors occur in ALMOST EVERY PAGE!! When it comes to something that I really do not understand, I have to place brute force in order to figure out if it is typing error or not."
3,"Better than I expected, not bad for the under 30 listener","The first I'd ever heard of The Veronicas was when I got a copy of the Australian TV series Cybergirl (PAL format- get it on eBay)- although the twins had only supporting roles in that series the DVD case promoted them. I eventually found out that they sing (most of their TV appearances appear to be related to promoting their singing career) and looked around for something they'd done.I didn't expect much but was pleased to find that this CD isn't really too bad. I suppose the teens and 20's group will like it better (I'm 49)but I found the musical accompaniment to be loud and sometimes overwhelming the lyrics. The song lyrics themselves seemed all right, I don't have any favorites, it sounds as though the sisters can actually sing. If you're their age, you might like the CD, if you're old enough to be the parents of the Veronicas at least your kids will have something all right to listen to."
1,This is pretty immature,The Veronicas are pretty silly Australians. Their music in totally insulting and horrible!
3,Muffled,"This is a decent enough recording, but it's not anywhere near the best that I have heard. The Andre Previn/LSO recording is much better mixed; at times it seems like there's a muffle on the mikes, or that you're hearing it from a distance.If I wanted good, dynamic background music, I'd do this. If I wanted to really listen to the music, I'd pick another version."
3,Nice quality,"Nice quality and looks great when finally installed. Putting it together and installing it was like changing the oil filter on a foreign exotic car. A lot of reaching and squeezing... Due to the design and clearance to the ceiling, replacement of lightbulbs is a chore. Most adult male hands can not reach in change the bulbs, my wife has to climb the ladder. She even has a problem with the bulb change and regrets the purchase...hence the three star rating."
5,The Best!,"This is the 5th Slumberjack Big Chair our family has purchased. The chair folds for storage or carrying in just seconds, but most of all the height of the chair is higher so it is easy to get in and out of. The chair also does not sink down, a person stays up high. Simply the best chair ever!!!!"
5,Way to go CJ!,"Well, I know Charlene personally and lets just say that shes' working on a few nice recipies to be published. I think my favorite is her Praline Glaze Cheesecake... mmm... Anything she cooks is great, and what a crazy lady she is. Dont let her get around her chainsaw!"
4,The Earth Under Sky Bear's Feet,My grandaughter is interested in the constellations -- this book combines information on the constellations with Indian poetry -- it is a lovely tribute to the sky.
1,horriable movie,i would not even give this a star if i did not have to. i bought this movie at my local FYE store and it was 0.07 and i got thinking it was going to be good but it is the worst movie ans i dont think it should have been made on blue ray let alone blue ray i think whi ever buys this movie is basically flushing their money down the drain . people let me help you save your money and say DONT BUY THIS MOVIE IT IS A COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY SND IT WAS A WASTE OF MY TIME WATCHING IT AFTER I WATCHED IT I THREW IT IN THE FIRE BECAUSE IT IS A HORIABLE MOVIE ITS NOT EVEN SCARY IT IS CHEAPKLY MADE AND LOOKS LIKE IT WAS MADE WITH A CHEAP ASS VIDEO CAMERA AND SOMEBODY FELT SORRY FOR THEM SO THEY HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO PUT IT ON DVD NO WONDER IT DID NOT GO TO THEATERS IT WOULD HSVE MADE ALOT OF PEOPLE VERY ANGRY AND PLEASE PEOPLE DONT BUY IT
1,"More Like ""NEARLY TRASH""","I'm not sure where to start on a movie this bad. The acting in this movie is absolutely horrendous. There is next to nothing in the F/X department. It seems that anybody could have thrown together a number of people from the street and produced a better movie.Please avoid this movie at all costs. ( Hey, I want my money back. )"
3,"Good quality, but makes my Jasjar's size problem worse.","This aluminum case is safe. Very tough. There are three main problems.1. It makes the big Jasjar much bigger - 1/8 to 1/4 inch all around (aluminum and neophrene.)2. You cannot use the touchscreen through the hard plastic transparent window. You can only access the 4-way pad with the OK button, and the side buttons (e.g. camera) when the case is closed.3. With the belt clip attachment, it extends at least two inches out from the outside of my belt, and bangs into things.This is a good clamshell storage case, but you need to do more than see the screen, take a picture, or press OK, you need to open the case."
4,platform bed,"great bed for the money- no doubtabout that. It does have sharp edges so watch out when you first set it up until you get used to it. My only complaint about the seller is the time it takes to ship the item. It was a couple of weeks and I don't really see any need for it to take that long and there was no communication or delivery information given other than an expected delivery time from with multiple dates listed. But the price can't be beat on the web anywhere- trust me, I looked!"
2,cheaply made,veeeery cheap material. mine fell apart in a few months. Also the assembly time was a few hours at the least.
4,Ok,"The bed is good for the price, not the best but ok. It took me about three hours to put together by myself, instructions were very clear and detailed. You must be careful when screwing the boards together as over doing it can break them. The only issue is getting the bed square which seems impossible, thus causing the drawers not to close flush against the bed. When I think I got the bed square and the right side drawers flush then the left side goes out of square and vice versa, it is only a minor thing I can live with.This is a good purchase for someone looking for an decent bed for low cost."
1,Awful,"Upon building the bed a side broke. Was able to fix it and finish building it, shouldn't of even bothered though. The bed slats broke, the sides broke and I ended up having to pay someone to remove it and buy a new bed."
2,"Good Price, Poor Quality","I've had this bed for a little over a year now. The drawers still all work though they've been misalligned since the second month. The frame does not hold up well to sex, I routinely pop bolts which will no longer go back in. It was easy to assembly, and for the price I guess I can't complain, I just don't expect it will last a second year, which is a shame, because having all the storage space is pretty nice."
3,Nice bed,"I bought the bed along with its matching headboard. The drawers are very convenient. The espresso color is nice; wish more of my other furniture would match it though. The assembly was frustrating at times. Be careful when setting up the drawers, and pay close attention to the directions (the pictures are in black and white and can be confusing). The final product is well worth the effort. Sometimes small things can fall in between the bed and the headboard and can be a pain to retrieve (phone, ear-plugs ect.). My family and friends are envious of my new bed and I love it. I think its the best bed I've ever had."
4,Does what it says...,I am satisfied with this bed frame. It took a couple of hours to assemble. Its not top notch quality but I am content and recommend.
1,Another glorified porno flick,"Okay folks, lets get real here. This story is just plain awful. Two spoiled brat mexican teens go on a joy ride with an older woman (married to a cousin of one of the boys at that) and the resulting sexual adventures. Of course we are treated to some graphic scenes with our ""heroes"" (?) engaging in sex with their girlfriends as the film begins. The stupid cousin in law, for reasons that are downright blasphemous (as the ending makes clear) ignorantly goes on the road with the hormone-filled but brainless teens and has the nerve to get disgusted midway with the predictable results.Pure trash with a capital T. Not a sympathetic character anywhere in sight. This is a prono flick disguised (not very well) as something ""meaningful."" If you want to watch this for arousal, go ahead, but don't deceive yuorself into thinking this is art."
3,It's allright allready,The people is indeed getting to know their human nature and all. But I'm not shure that is a nature worth exploring in a movie. Some of the worst road trips I've been involved in have been as twice as fun as theirs. The jokes are sometimes a bit witty.The actors perfomance is indeed very good.
3,I liked it well enough,"I think I was expecting more with all of the 5 star reviews, but I mostly enjoyed it.I thought it was moving way too slow for a very long time. The narrator had some very tasty tidbits on back stories, and I wish those would have been explored more. I think it would still have been a good coming of age story, but without the repetitive dialog. However, even when I didn't like the dialog, I loved the scenery and villages that were part of the trip. Worth watching just for that, IMO.It picked up a lot once they got to the beach, I thought. I loved that.The ending was spectacular. There were a few predictable things, but the surprises were awesome and well done.If any women are thinking this sounds like a guy movie, I don't think it was, and it is worth a watch.Be warned, the subtitles have lots of places where they get fuzzy. You can make them out well enough (and sometimes they aren't really needed) but it is annoying."
2,The Extras section won't play,"I bought this DVD and returned it because, while the movie was fine, the Extras section won't play. I have the same problem with the replacement DVD. Movie is great but manufacturer needs to correct this defect in future pressings."
5,One of the best coming of age movies!!,"I really loved the movie. It is a really sad movie in a way. It is about two teenagers going on a few days trip with an older woman. In some way this reminds me ""Les Valseuses"" with Gerard Depardieu. The acting is remarkable. There is lot of nudity and erotic in this movie but it seems just in the right place and time here. In other words, this is the case where all this erotic serves the purpose of the movie, is harmonic with the movie spirit."
3,Nothing special,"This was quite an entertaining film - a pretty good combination of style and substance and definitely not something you would see in American cinema. However, I think the hype is a bit overblown simply b/c everyone wants to fall in love with 'the edgy mexican movie'. I was definitely drawn in while I watched in the theater, but there wasn't much to talk about afterward - which probably says something about the story/message. While I can appreciate a necessary [physical] scene - this film tended to depend on [physcial activity] to keep the viewer's attention.I'd suggest to rent/buy 'Amores Perros' before this one. It has a much more memorable plot, more interesting style of storytelling, and doesn't use [physical] appeal as a crutch like 'Y Tu Mama Tambien' [though it still has PLENTY]."
2,Mexico can do better,"I can struggle through reading subtitles is the film itself offers something worth while. I admit that this tale begins with a couple of young girls with the kind of shape that pleases a male audience. That they were less than scantily clad certainly got my attention. After that, the movie dwindled into a road movie where the two girls are off to Europe and their less interesting boyfriends engage in a road trip to the beach. Now, I didn't think Mexico was that wide, but this beach trip takes forever and these main characters don't get any deeper in their conversation. It amazes me that some foreign films get so much attention when there are some truly good ones out there. El Mariachi is practically a classic. There is a commentary in Spanish but I don't speak enough to understand it."
1,Truly disgusting and utterly sinful,"This film made me so sick to my stomach, but what's much worse is the fact that people are willing to accept this trash as ""normal"" behavior. I, for one, do not know a single teenager who did anything close to the ""17 year olds"" in this filth. But I guess me and my friends were too busy expanding our knowledge instead of burying our faces in carnal desires.Question- how do you sell a movie in the year 2003? SEX! Regardless of the consequences. And that's all this film is. There is no plot, and no characters, as far as I'm concerned.This movie has no meaning. The sex is meaningless. In my day, sex with someone MEANT something. I simply do not see how this can be called art. And the acting? Please! Its just horrible. Its not art. Trash is all this is."
4,"good but no ""masterpiece""","Good: the underlying real-worldliness of the film---the premise that everybody lies to everybody else and themselves, that friends are friends from one moment to the next not forever, that in life there is no forever but only a string of moments and therefore we must learn to live and love accordingly.The sex scenes have a refreshing realism to them, there's none of the MTV-stylized fake glamour designed to titillate repressed American audiences. It's just people being people physically enjoying people...nothing more, nothing less, no inhibitions but also no pretensions either.Why no ""masterpiece""---poor film editing makes for several slow and over-long scenes. This movie feels longer than it is, just doesn't flow as well as another recent (much closer to ""masterpiece"" status) Mexican film, ""Amor es perros."" That being said, the characters are brilliantly cast and you could do much, much worst than watching this movie."
2,"Nice travelogue, tedious film","The people who made this movie must have watched every one of those amoral French movies of the '70s. Lots of cigarettes smoked, beers consumed, and more marijuana than any movie this side of Cheech and Chong. The trip through the Mexican countryside is visually fascinating, but the story is hackneyed. I can't call this a coming of age story because it is hard to see how the boys would be matured by this escapist fantasy. And do people really find this erotic? It's all very predictable and has a ridiculously manipulative ending. Hugely overrated. But I'd love to see a grown-up movie in the same setting."
3,These aren't very good,I would save your money on these. They look better than they are. Neither my husband nor myself cared for them. Kind of like chewing on a hard waffle. I won't be buying them again.
5,Hard to find and delicious.,Stroopwafels are traditionally found in Europe and served with coffee. Hard to find in the US and I was thrilled to see that someone was finally importing them. Best when set atop a freshly poured hot cup of coffee or something tea. The heat melts the caramel inside the wafer and is sinfully good. Anyone will appreciate these as a gift.
2,Too many surprises,"I agree with others the Brother Technical Support is virtually nonexisting. My MFC8440 works great as a printer and dedicated fax. It does not work with TAD the same way as my previous MFC8300 (the best machine I ever had). This is the first great disappointment because setting does not allow change that. PC fax works properly as well. However, PC fax software can not be used by serious business user. It is very limited. Total disappointment is the scanner. Software can not find it. I tried all possible connections: direct printer port, direct USB, network. Tech support lady told me the only version equipped with optional Brother network card will allow me to use scanner. I did not buy it. Summarizing: you can get better product from other manufacturers."
3,Disappointed,"It's a good machine for what is does, however, it does not count the pages it scans in to be faxed so you have to wait until after the fax has gone through and check the confirmation page to determine if all pages were scanned and sent. Also, it does not have the capability to print out a confirmation page for each incoming fax so unless the sender puts the number of pages on a cover sheet, you have no way of determining whether you received the entire transmission."
5,Excellent Buy!,"I purchased this MFC after my previous Brother MFC died, getting the dreaded error 41. I was very leary at first to buy another Brother product and even purchased a Lexmark X4270 MFC (which I returned the following day) and then a Canon L80 (which I also returned two days later). I run a home office and needed something reliable enough to withstand a tremendous amount of faxing and copying.This machine does it all! It receives clear, clean faxes very quickly and I was particularly impressed that it comes with a full sized toner and drum as opposed to a starter cartridge that most machines come with. That's savings right off the bat! I was receiving faxes within 15 minutes of opening the box. I can't believe I wasted the time, work and effort with the other machines I bought prior to this one.I'd recommend this product to anyone looking for a reliable, user friendly multifunction machine."
2,Sergei Rachmaninoff: Greatest Hits,The cover is misleading. It lists the 2nd piano concerto but the CD only has a small part of the concerto on it.
1,Don't order until Amazon fixes this!,"The picture and the item description are not the same!I ordered this thinking that they would send what was described. Instead I got what is in the picture. When I sent it back, I explained this to them. Instead Amazon refunded my money under the reason ""item shipped late.""Hopefully somebody will fix this problem soon. I'd really like to order the Rhino Beanie Vites because they are awesome!"
3,Interesting Story Holds Up Over Time,"The Boy in the Plastic Bubble is dated in appearance given the year it was produced but still tells a compelling and true story of a boy forced to live in a germ-free room due to a severe immune deficiency. A young John Travolta gives a sensitive performance in the lead role.The most riveting moment personally, was the last scene where he chooses to leave the protected room so that he can experience the outside world and actually touch the girl he has fallen for. You can practically experience with him all of what he sees, smells and hears as he ventures outside. That is how the film ends. We can guess what eventually happens but playing that out would drag the film down. The unfortunate aspect of this DVD is that the visual and audio quality is poor; obviously just a video transfer and not from a master print obviously. Still the story was worth watching."
3,Too mawkish and melodramatic,Too mawkish and melodramatic for my tastes. This is one really dreary story with bad acting and cornball dialogue. Only thing I liked was the theme song by Paul Williams.
2,One Of Travolta's Best Movies.,"I can still remember this movie when it was shown on TV back in 1976. I thought it was a good story. It still is, but I was extremely disappointed in the DVD release of it. It's a really bad transfer & the packaging that it came in is really pitiful. I can't understand why they (Essex Entertainment) would want to cheapen the best format in the world?There was also a huge error on it as well. On the disc they have: ""The Boy In The Bubble"".It's a shame that this great movie had to be wrecked by a very poor DVD release."
3,"Got a minute, sell your house","I'm still looking for the ""Readers Digest Large Print"" seal of approval on the cover. This book could have been a pamphlet or at most a 'pocket' book, lots of white space. It would have been nice to see this book before purchase but then, I would have read it already! I guess all those blank, or nearly blank, pages are there for you to keep notes. --John"
1,Not at all what we were hoping for.....,"We were very surprised to get this book and see what it really was. It is all about getting people to bid on your house. Not something I was looking for, for help with selling my home. I don't want anyone else to waste money buying it if you don't want to list $50,000-$100,000 less than you want to and try to get people to out bid each other! Not for Us!"
5,Love is forever but rare to find,very heartwarming to know True Love has existed and can exist with the right person. This makes you laugh and cry and gasp and hold your heart in your hands and say ahhh.
2,It would not play in any machine!,"I am thankful that (weeks later and after a time-consuming telephone call) Amazon.com refunded my money. The digital video disc that arrived would not play in my laptop computer, in a notebook computer, or in two DVD players connected to televisions. The message on the screen said something about no disk being inserted. That is the first problem that i have had with anything that i have purchased through Amazon.com."
1,No secrets here,"I was personally looking for a book that talks about the person who steps up, leads and never apologises for behavior or desire, that person that people look up to because they are uncomprimising. This book teaches you how to be mr nice guy to everybody with out really giving away any secrets, or at least that was my impression after 3 chapters (it's a bit boring read too). Just my thoughts."
2,"Not much new info for me, but good for younger person possibly","The first couple chapters were interesting, but then it seemed like something I might have found useful about 15 years ago. If you have read any of the more popular PUA books or social dynamic stuff, this is way on the novice end in comparison. Also it is co-written by a woman, so if you are interesting in using it to meet women, it is mostly useless. There were some good bits of info, such as what men find attractive vs what women do, but seems like a better read for a high school age person just learning to talk to girls."
5,Not Quite Seduction. Lots of Body Language Info.,"I thought this book was better than Hogan's, The Psychology of Persuasion.Even though the book is about relationships and dating (though not quite seduction though he comes close at times), I'm using this book for selling.The book is heavy on body language and how to make a great impression. That alone was worth the price of admission. The book reads very quickly and even though there is an awful lot of scientific research discussed, it's not enough to get you bogged down.This is a fun read and a book to keep on the shelf for a long time to come.DT"
5,Intense as a Journey,"I admit it, I just love the tv series and its characters. But even complete novices to the world of Prue, Phoebe and Piper will love this journey to the bayous of Louisiana. Voodoo, Wicca and The Power Of Three... set in a beautiful scenery described so lively that you can almost feel the damp air of the swamps... plus characters that come to live - what more can you wish for? More books like this, maybe!"
4,One of the better Charmed novels.,"One of the things that makes this novel stand out is the change in locale, as the Halliwell sisters travel to New Orleans on vacation. The inclusion of voodoo gives the story a different spin than the usual Warlocks and Demons that The Charmed Ones usually face, also they solve their problems without the Book of Shadows for a change (they left it at home). Being a young adult novel, the story doesn't get too complicated but it does manage to keep your attention and even throws in a couple of twists. For those who watch the series, the story seems to be placed in the first season as we see that Piper is still a chef and Prue works at Buckland's, the auction house."
5,REMEBER the history!,I is Important to see this video. Historical facts that need to be remembered! It is as important to remember today as it was whenit happened. Lest we forget!
4,Gripping,"Subtle and definitely most intriguing. Hoffman does it so well with his unyielding enthusiasm to find the truth but without a clue what the consequences will be. Redford is almost as focused in his role despite facing Hoffman's theories with skepticsim. This still begs the question, ""Is the government that powerful and fearsome?"""
1,The movie put me to sleep. It lacks great synthesizer music.,"Don't get me wrong, but this movie stinks. I saw it during my senior year in college, it was for a govt class. and this film lacks a great musical score, you know? back ground music, it does not have any. This movie is so boring-i was just so happy it had ended it is like 2 hours or 1 hour and 45 minutes if i remember correctly. Once you see tons of movies and shows you will see what i am talking about. I don't mind if this movie was redone again[for a newer audience, a new generation] because the old one stinks. I would not mind seeing scarlett johansson be in a newer version. 2005: the secret is out, everyone knows who deep throat is...to some he is a hero while to others he is something else, but who cares? he exposed the truth. the story is a good one but the movie stinks. and whose fault is it?the lousy director, producers, and the writers."
1,"Half there, couldn't watch the whole thing","I love the true story 'all the president's men' but the movie was to be a 2 cd set and only one cd was in the container, and I never got any satisfaction after contacting Amazon. I returned it and got a reply the return was incomplete. Was most disgruntled. JE"
3,Nixon goes down.,"All the President's Men starring Robert Redford and Dustin Hoffman is an interesting look at the Watergate scandal. I like this film because it is part of history and I think the facts are pretty accurate. The Deep Throat character is played by Jason Robards, his voice is like no other. Captivating movie, check it out sometime!"
1,All The President's Wimps,"I didn't like this movie very much. I only rented it because Stephen Collins was in it as Hugh W. Sloan Jr. I liked his role because I like him and he's very attractive guy for being 55 years old. I like him best in this movie. He's also very very good as Eric Camden on the hit ABC television show 7th Heaven. Way to go, Stephen!"
3,Works great but too expensive,"I would give this product 5 stars because it works good but why is it so expensive?? They need some competition, that's why!"
3,not in the class of goodbye yellow brick road and capt fantastic,"yes inspite of the rave reviews by fans i dont think this album is in the class of goodbye yellow brick road or captain fantastic.i'm a seasoned classic rock listener but my exposure to elton john is only 5 years old. i first started with goodbye yellow ..., followed by captain fantastic. both are musically fantastic albumns. having revelled in the pleasure of both these, honky chateau was the next album i bought. disappointed!honky cat and rocket man are the stand out tracks here. mellow, i think ..., salvation, monalisa ... are quite interesting. but beyond that ...dont get me wrong. i'm not saying the album is bad. just that it is not elton's best. the album seems to lack the cohesiveness and mood and magic of the aforementioned albums.imo you could get goodbye yellow brick road, capt fantastic and grab the two greatest hits cds (vol1 and vol2). that should give you a great representation of elton john's music."
4,Some great stuff,"A great album from EJ. And almost every song has something of interest on it, whether it be Jean-Luc Ponty's electric violin solo on ""Mellow"", or the tap dancing on ""I think I'm going to kill myself"", with it's vaudeville feel. Then of course there are the hits ""Honky Cat"" and ""Rocket Man"". Add to that the gorgeous ""Mona Lisas and Mad Hatters"" and you have a very good album. The 12 page booklet contains all the lyrics and a 4 page essay."
4,Good book,This book was very informative. I am interested in starting to fish for pike and muskie. I liked the pictures that were included. I look forward to using the tips
3,Not So Good With Hard Water,"At my parents' house it works great, because they have soft water. I like the idea of this product, but it just seems to build up too much in my hair with our hard water. I've switched to the herbal formula with terrific results."
2,Terrible with Hard Water,"Let me preface this by saying that this does not work with hard water. I'm pretty sure others have mentioned this, but since it's the primary reason for this review, I have to say it again. I gave this shampoo bar 2 weeks. During that time, my hair was somewhat thicker, but it was also constantly filled with static, and just seemed really dry (which is weird, because I normally have oily hair). The fact of the matter is that SLS was pretty much created to work well with hard water--and it does. I pretty much have no choice but to continue to use my regular shampoo. I'm sure this shampoo probably works great with soft water, but since I don't have soft water, I can't really say. I only know it didn't work for me."
5,J R Liggett Old-Fashioned Shampoo Original Formula 3.50 oz,"J R Liggett Old-Fashioned Shampoo Original Formula is a great product if you find that bottled shampoos dry out your hair too much. Without all the extra chemicals that bottled shampoos use, my hair comes out shiny and clean and manageable every time I use it."
2,Received wrong color,"I have fair to medium skin tone so I ordered 'Cafe A Lait' because it appeared to be slightly lighter than 'Natural'. Instead, I received 'Cafe AU Lait', a different color entirely. I'm not sure if 'cafe A lait' exists and there was just a typo when entering AU lait, but it still doesn't make sense because AU lait was an option as we'll, and it appeared much darker. Either way, I'm disappointed because I don't want to deal with paying to return these because someone shipped me the wrong order and risk receiving another wrong color."
3,Bob Hope video,"Purchased this video because I had seen Bob Hope when I was over seas stationed on the USS John F Kennedy CVA-67. I was kind of disappointed as this video seemed like it was too many, too short clips. Would be better if they could put together videos of each individual stop he made. That sad, Bob Hope and troupe were wonderful, I had seen some of his tours on TV years before I was in service, but never thought I'd see him in person. Even got to shake his hand and say a few words. He's gone but not forgotten. Thanks for the memories."
5,"Hey, shushashai martial arts?",This is the greatest movie ever. What's ironic is there is a character who is Vietnamese and his name is Charlie. There's plenty more to comment on but I would be here all night. It was very entertaining.
1,Cocalo Sugar Plum Hamper,"I took some time to look for the best price on this item and thought it would look cute in my daughter's room, even though her entire bedding set was from Bombay. I was extremely surprised with the poor quality of this item, the wood isn't very sturdy and appears cheap as compared to my son's hamper that I bought about 5 years ago at Marshall's. I paid 36.00 and I am extremely disappointed. I guess if you truly are just buying it for a baby's room and don't plan on using it long term, you should be okay. But, check your local retailers first as they might have better quality hammpers for almost 1/2 the price..."
3,K-cup coffee,I ordered the variety pack to try out all the different flavors. This was the lowest priced k-cups I could find on the web (about 34 cents/cup). The coffee was not great-not as smooth as I would like and a little strong for my taste.
2,Taste like chemicals,"I don't really like Gloria's coffee, not even from the mall. To me these are weak coffees that taste like chemicals. I like flavored coffee but not this brand, go for Timothy's."
2,Five Flavors; Only One Worth Drinking,"Of the 5 flavors contained in Gloria Jean's Variety Pack, the Cappuccino is the only one that comes close to being a satisfactory cup of coffee.The rest had such a ""fake"" taste to them and left an unpleasant aftertaste. Combine that with the inherent weakness of single serve coffees and I ended up disappointed with Gloria Jean Coffee..When the coffee is good, buying double through Amazon is a great deal. When the coffee is inferior you end up frustrated that you had to buy twice as much to find out it was half as good.Back to Green Mountain and/or Timothy's for this shopper!"
5,Not too bad at all.,"I really like the variety of the coffees. I couldn't really tell the difference between the Chocolate Almond, Cappachino and French Vanilla once the creamer was added. But the Butter Toffee was a pleasant surprise. Well worth the experimentation component with Keurig machines."
1,Most Bland KCup Coffee I've Tasted,"We love our Keurig KCup Coffee Machine and have been experimenting with various brands of KCups. We bought the Gloria Jean Sample pack because of the refreshingly exciting names of the coffees, expecting the tastes to be just as excitingly refreshing. Unfortunately, they all taste the same and with closed eyes we are unable to tell the difference between any of them (except the chocolate, which is probably more smell than taste). All are very bland, whether dark or light, with very little taste. By far, the most distinctive and delicious brand we've found so far is Tully's and have not been disappointed with any of their flavors."
3,GOOD FOR TRIAL AND ERROR,"This is a good way to ""TRY"" several flavors before buying a whole box of a flavor you end up NOT liking. There are several flavors in this assortment that I will NOT order in the future."
3,"Unremarkable, except for wonderful Mad World cover","I bought this CD solely for the stupendous cover of Mad World, which is much much better than the original. Otherwise, there's not much depth here, and a couple of the songs sound uncannily like early Simon and Garfunkel."
4,Gary Jules...,"Gary Jules took me by surprise with the ""Mad World"" cover--and while the whole CD feels different from that single song, all of it is wonderful. I also enjoy Simon & Garfunkel, and though Gary Jules sounds a lot like them, he still has his distinct merits from the group. Enjoyable lyrics and calming music. If you're this type of person, then this is for you."
4,Chair is made for people with arthiritis,"I bought this chair for my husband, who suffers fro severe arthritis. He is now able to sit and get up with less strain on his knees and lower back."
4,be carefull,"chair is great! first bussiness day after purchase,someone used my credit card number to purchase a computer online, recommend using another form of payment."
1,Slim volume..Slim pickings,Please note..this book (?pamphlet)is all of 48 pages long. It has zero helpful to say about strategy and tactics. It doesnt even list the optimal rollout moves EXCEPT FOR DOUBLES. It has a total of 2 very old backgammon problems. What little interest there is has to do with variations on the game as played in other countries.
3,Don't Get Hooked,"If you have this much time and want a beautiful desert, you would do better to watch Lawrence of Arabia. If you want a great love story set in World War II - at least Casablanca or many others.Overall not bad, and Kristin Scott Thomas very lovely, but the reviewer from Queens, Andrew Macewen, got it right with his reference to the narcissism of the two ill fated lovers and the damage they spread around.Steer clear."
2,A little slow,"This movie has beautiful cinematography, nice acting, and an unusual setting. The plot did not grip me and I found the love story to be ho-hum because of the way its told in flash back. I know a lot of people really loved it, and if you're someone who likes sophistocated stories you might love it to. But if you're a boring American like me, the pacing isn't fast enough and the movie is very long.The one TRULY exceptional part of this film, however, is its score. Buy it!"
2,Not half as good as Casablanca,"I expected to love The English Patient for many of the same reasons that people love Casablanca--WWII romance, exotic setting, memorable characters.... but I was badly disappointed. The central relationship between Fiennes and Scott-Thomas (who is, in my view, just another name in the long list of anorexic actresses that Hollywood uses, then loses)is flat and uninteresting, so my overall reaction is: who gives a hoot about these two? As another reviewer pointed out, it's more lust than love, but as the film moves toward its denouement, you're suddenly supposed to believe that he cares so much about her that he'll risk his life to save her. It's just not believable. It all adds up to an overly self-conscious (albeit pretty) film that can't hold a candle to the stirring love story that unfolds in Rick's Cafe Americain."
1,I HATE IT !!!!!!!!!,"If your an insomniac in need of sleep, this movie is for you. You'll sleep better than you ever have during this movie. I share the same opinion of this movie as Julia Louis-Dreyfus' character Elaine Benes in Seinfeld.""Seinfeld: The English Patient"" (1997)[Elaine and Peterman are watching ""The English Patient"". Elaine is about to freak out of boredom]Elaine Benes: [quietly] No. I can't do this any more. I can't. It's too long.Elaine Benes: [yells] Quit telling your stupid story about the stupid desert, and just die already! DIE!J. Peterman: [surprised] Elaine, you don't like the movie?Elaine Benes: [shouts] I hate it![the audience shushes Elaine]Elaine Benes: [shouts back] Oh, go to hell!"
1,I've seen better film on teeth,"After its dramatic sweep of the Academy Awards, I was finally compelled to see this ""masterpiece,"" after all the Academy couldn't be wrong. Well they were and so is every imbicile that tells you this movie was ""riviting"" or that it was a beautifully trajic love story. Here's a piece of advice, if you want the viewer to be captured in the couple's forbidden love, first you have to make us care about the characters themselves. A Pauly Shore movie has more dimension. If you want to see a love story worth its salt go rent True Romance or Like Water for Chocolate."
2,Mediocre Product,"Like other reviewers, I was disappointed that this DVD movie had no subtitles and that it was produced using an inferior video format (1034i). As one with hearing a deficit, I would not have bought it had I known this; maybe it is my own fault for not researching the product more closely; I will be much more cautious in the future, as I am with BBC-produced items which often lack English subtitles. Even my 1997 ""English Patient"" laserdisc has subtitles. The less-than-ideal DVD sound quality makes Kristin Scott-Thomas's telling of the story of Gyges almost unintelligible unless one has heard it before. I'd think that an ethical seller 13 years later would have made a point of noting the primitive audio status of this product in the interest of service to handicapped persons. Only the Direction of Anthony Minghella and superb acting mitigate this defect."
2,"Long, and it feels it","I ususally love films in this genre but I was very dissapointed in this film. It just didn't do anything for me emotionally. I felt nothing. Even at the end I felt nothing. I'm not sure why, but I thought most of the film was rather bland and dragged terribly. This should have been the perfect film for me, but it was the complete opposite. Long movies do not bother me in the least, but I was getting restless half way through. Its a pity because the actors in this are some of my most favorite."
3,Immitation of Lawrence of Arabia!,"This film is a rip-off of Lawrence of Arabia.....the only thing original to it is the love story! It's not bad, but no other movie can be compared to Lawrence of Arabia! I suggest you watch the David Lean epic first and then compare it to The English Patient. Someone please tell Ralph Fiennes to stop immitating Peter O'Toole!"
1,Rubbish,"Pure rubbish and a complete load of old tripe. Do not bother with this film as it's mind-numbingly dull, complacent, self-satisfied, smug and self-indulgent. It beggers belief that it received Academy Awards but if you like David Lean without the skill of direction or political acuity than you just may like it. Otherwise, leave it alone and let it die in peace."
1,Snoozefest,"Would someone please tell me what this movie is about? I tried watching it several times, but fell asleep long before the ending each time.One great thing about this movie...It's allowed me to throw-away my Ambien pills.Probably one of the worst five movies I've ever watched. Watching flies crawling up my drapes is more watchable."
5,Movie Condition and Enjoyment,The movie was in excellent shape when it arrived and I enjoyed watching it. Your delivery of the product was very prompt and I appreciate it. Thanks
5,"Finally, and excellent transfer!!","I had already purchased The English Patient once before on Blu Ray, and was pretty disappointed with the picture quality. But THIS version has a fantastic picture. Crystal clear image, vivid colors, etc. It will probably make you want to buy a bigger Hi-Def TV. I highly recommend this one!"
2,An overated romantic melodrama set during WWII.,"A lot of much ado about very little. The story concerns a burn patient who may- or may not be - a war criminal. The patient, Ralph Fiennes, overacts throughout and has enough mannerisms and affectations to win an Oscar. Why he didn't win is beyond me. The plot is only so-so and falls to pieces at the end. Don't expect too much and you won't be disappointed."
5,The English Paper,One of the best adaptation of a recent books related to Second World War.Excellent acting.. A must for your bluray collection
3,A good device but not perfect.,"The IDEAL tester is UL listed. AMPROBE INSP-3 is not UL listed.This tester needs no battery. AMPROBE INSP-3 needs 9V battery.IDEAL SURETEST provides HOT, NEUTRAL and GROUND impedance readings. AMPROBE INPS-3 gives you the % drops on HOT and NEUTRAL circuits.IDEAL gives you HOT to NEURAL fault current and HOT to NEUTRAL/GROUND fault current.AMPROBE give you HOT to NEUTRAL current and HOT to GROUND fault current.Both of them load with short pulse to measure the data.They do not affect the other loads.Make sure you plug in the outlet in a very clean movement. Otherwise you can get wrong readings.These imepdances and fault currents reading are not very trustworth. You can use them as a good reference but not a pass/fail tool.To get a good measurement you should disconnect the other loads on the same source (most of time, it is impossible)."
5,Outstanding,Especially impressed with the Danray lamp. This add-on is extremely well constructed and a great buy based on its quality.
2,Accumulair,"Product is fine but there are packaging problems from this vendor. The first shipment was damaged in transit. The box was smashed on one end and the filter frames were torn and the filters crushed on one end. The vendor responded immediately and shipped a replacement at no cost. This was great but the second shipment was also damaged. The box was bent and the filters were creased. The frames were damaged and the filters would not straighten out. I would not buy filters in this shape from a brick and mortar store. The problem is that because of the physical dimenions of the shipment (long, wide but narrow) the light weight container with no reinforcement used by the vendor is not sufficient to protect the shipment."
5,"Very evocative, sentimental music","This is one of the best movie soundtracks that I have ever listened to . All the songs, evoke different feelings of melancholy, joy and happiness.Listening to the CD, evoked such a good sense of well-being and of being loved, not just by a significant other but just knowing how it feels to have someone care about you or how you feel when you care about someone.I borrowed the CD from a friend because I had listened to La Mer and liked it. Thank you DEFB. After watching the movie and listening to the entire CD afterwards, I knew that I had to add this to my collection. The CD marries well with the movie. It reinforces all those feelings of unselfish love, sacrifice and caring that I got from the movie."
3,"Good Map, challenging format","While the map was incredibly detailed and included all the information necessary for a good user experience, it was mailed rolled up in a tube. Trying to unroll the map and then fold it into the traditional format was cumbersome and time consuming. Would have been a lot better if it was mailed already folded, like most maps are."
3,Rare CDs,"Too bad that stores no longer have OBSCURE rock like Pure Prairie League, but luckilly, Amazon had it and it was new. And it sounds great."
4,Another great romance by Rosemary Rogers!,"I am a big fan of Rosemary Rogers & this book is certainly one of her best! I read it years ago & the story stuck with me so I recently reread it. I wasn't disappointed. Their is a lot of passion in the book & enough intrigue to keep you glued until the end! Although her historical novels are great also, I hope Rosemary decides to write another book like this (& The Insiders). It's gives the reader a change of pace from the normal setting of romance novels."
2,TransCast,"This product works, but nowhere near as good as the transmitter I bought from Sharper Image for my iPod. It is very difficult to find a station that is ""empty"" and does not cause static. If you are driving more then 25 miles, it takes constant adjustment to keep relatively static free music. In retrospect, I find it would be better to listen to my Sony Walkman with one earbud in, then have to hastle with locating a clear station all the time."
1,Terrible piece of junk,"Actually this item is worth zero stars. This must be the worst piece of electronics I ever bought. The range is feeble (reception quality varies within the space of the car!), the tone quality 'thin', lacking any depth, and the build quality beggars belief. I have rarely used it after the first few attempts, but the audio socket has come detached from the circuit board and the tuning knob drops off frequently. A much much better bet is Arkon's SoundfeederArkon SF150A SoundFeeder Wireless FM Transmitterat half the price. Stronger signal and good, deep sound."
1,Don't buy it!,I just purchased the DLO transmitter for my Sandisk C240. It sounds HORRIBLE! You might be able to hear the music but you won't be able to hear the words. I guess I was expecting more like being able to actually hear the song. I am returning this back to the store asap. I wonder if the other brands sound any better?
1,RUSTS!!!!!!,This iron would be fine if it didnt RUST!!!!! I just ruined a totally pricy shirt. Do not buy this!I did leave the water in the resevoir for 2 hours and this iron dripped rust on my shirt.
3,nothing special just like any other x'mas cd,nothing special about this cd and it's just ok on the soundtrack so won't be playing this cd too offten
1,Poor quality,"I returned these sheets as soon as I received them. I think if you held them up to the light you could read a newspaper through them. They were said to be a much higher cost item at a greatly reduced price, but even at 6.99 for a king set, they were too cheap to keep. I would have rated them with zero stars, but that does not seem to be an option."
4,Where can I get the Nile map on a poster?,"What a surprising combination of a book that actually is much better than expected and yet disappointing. The introduction of the book is great, leading the children towards apprehension of time, and the map of the Nile is a winner, wish I had it as a poster! Through the book the pictures could though often do with a more work on them, it's like some of the pages aren't fully made. And some photos show informations you wish the text told the children about. But the book does a better job helping them to coprihend the everyday life than any other I've seen, and it's just when it comes to religion and the pharaoh than it becomes a bit disappointing. When working with the 6 to 10 years old on Egypt it was the religious sermonises that got to them. And I just can't help but think how can such a good book miss the opportunity to introduce the Canopic Jars, and then ... WHY ON EARTH ARE THE EGYPTIANS COLORED SO LIGHT SKINNED???"
3,ok movie,I liked this movie and paris also. But it could have been alittle bit better. It had a slow start but in the end it was pretty good.
2,Not step by step,To learn software you need a step by step approach. A book that teaches you as you create an example project is always best for learning software; this one does not.It is not comprehensive enough to be a reference manual.
3,interesting,I found this Book to be interesting.Shaq is one of the Few NBA Players to come clean on His Play&His Competition.I Dig His Honesty on various Topics.Shaq has alot of Humor as well.Bro Man had Me Rolling a Few times.I Hope in a Few Years He does a FOllow Up He is the Most Dominate Player in the Game TOday for He has Worked Hard at Being it.

5,Russell t-shirts,"I exclusively buy Russell t-shirts for one reason:THE NECKS NEVER, EVER DROOP EVEN WHEN THEY ARE SEVERAL YEARS OLD !this is a very big issue with me and Russell is the only t-shirt I have ever owned that keeps it shape."
5,Russell Big & Tall Short Sleeve Tshirt w/pocket,"This was my second purchase for these tshirts. I have found them to be soft & comfortable.They have stood up to my daily work and remained like new.I highly recommend them for those of you who want ""tall"" tshirts w/pocket."
3,Good quality but....,It's a good quality shirt but the tall was not the right length it needed to be longer and it has a bad tendency to ride up when my husband wore it. We both like the shirt though it is a good price.
4,Good men's pocket t-shirt,"Bought for my husband who needs extra length in his shirts. It's a little pricey and there aren't many color choices in 2XT. Aside from that, the fit is true to size & the material is a good weight - not thin & flimsy."
5,I would buy another,"I bought three Russell T shirts, one blue, one charcoal and one white. The blue and charcoal shirts were as advertised. I enjoyed the feel, the size was correct and I was and still am (after washing several times) happy with the purchase. On the other hand, the white T shirt despite the tags indicating it was the same size as the blue and charcoal shirts simply was not. The neck was too big, the sleeves shorter and the pocket was practically in the center of the chest."
5,Great Classic Movie,"Sonia Henie the way people remember her. The ice skating is great and the acting is classic. They do not make movies like this anymore. My mother loved it, because she saw it years ago growing up."
5,Still lost...,"Just a beautiful, intelligent, amazing journey of a book. Maybe you've never taken a road trip from California to Canada with three strangers, a trip full of cats, new friendships and lost souls, but Lost at Sea will make you nostalgic for that time you did. And that's a very good thing."
5,Excellent,Great explanations of the material covered and excellent question & answer sections. The explanations to the answers are very helpful.
1,Awful - this book is Awful,"I normally like the examples and explanations books - even though they are extremely wordy - but generally I find that the extra wordiness at the end, helps the concepts to make sense in the end. I'm looking for the second half of this book - I can't believe how general all the explanations are - and in paragraph form for a tax course?! Um = absurd. The equations (for example calculated excludable amounts for annuities and life insurance plans) are not even written out! They're mushed in words in paragraph/ sentence form - a truly awful awful awful way to learn rather simple arithmetic equations. This book is garbage - I'm happy I realized this now with a month to go in the semester and did not wait last minute to depend on this book - cause I would have been screwed. I want the authors to give a refund. USELESS. Can give it to the birds to make a nest our of."
3,His best? I don't agree!,"While I loved 3 of the songs, the title track, Someone Saved my Life Tonight, of course, and Tower of Babel, I couldn't get through the rest. I gave a star for each of the 3 good ones. Buy Tumbleweed Connection, Madman Across the Water, Goodbye Yellow brick Road, or even Songs From TheWest Coast instead."
5,Are there more stars...,"Of all of the dozens of CD's you could get with this guy, you can't beat ""Fantastic"". The best of Elton John and Bernie Taupin is RIGHT HERE. You don't have to look no more!!! Gif."
3,"Not bad, but not great either","The cover is about the most interesting thing about this record. The title track starts the record off in promising fashion and ""Bitter Fingers"" shows flashes of the old Elton, but the rest is somewhat boring. Sounds very dated to listen to it now."
2,Not-So-Fantastic,"Come on people, this was always overrated. It was the continuation of EJ's big downslide that began with Caribou. Outside of the title cut, Someone Saved My Life Tonight, and (maybe) Curtains, there's nothing memorable about this album. I was disappointed when I bought it 26 years ago and I still find it a letdown from his earlier work. If you want great Elton, listen to the amazing string of 5 albums that began with Tumbleweed Connection and ended with Goodbye Yellowbrick Road."
5,Excellent,Excellent service and a great book of flying adventures. Highly recommended for the aviation enthusiast.
3,Source of several much-played 1970 songs.,"Several of these songs got a lot of airplay in 1970: ""Your Song"" (the big hit from this album), ""Take Me To The Pilot,"" ""Sixty Years On"" (very pretty nylon string guitar with strings intro), ""Border Song"" (typical Elton John piano intro). This early version of ""Grey Seal"" lacks the dazzling piano arpeggios that made it sound so great on the ""Goodbye Yellow Brick Road"" album, it's a tiny bit slower, and the ending chords aren't as rockish as that later version, but it still sounds good, especially with the strings. All the songs sound decent on this album, though it's too much on the soft side for my personal taste, and none of the songs really grabbed me--""Goodbye Yellow Brick Road"" & ""Tumbleweed Connection"" & his other 1971-1974 era albums are much better in songwriting, playing, instrumentation, and lyrics, in my opinion."
1,Not happy,This product wasn't as detailed as I thought it would be. It doesn't include what I consider the best of Martha's wedding ideas. I was disappointed.
2,Not in G Tuning,"While the content is good, I was a disappointed because the bulk of the book is not dealing with the standard G tuning, which is just an added complexity for a beginner."
5,The best beginning banjo book,"I love this book. I got it with my banjo and am just starting, but I read it through and through. It is a great read with just a ton of information and instruction."
3,In the begining,Face it this software is for the beginers. That's all it's intended for so don't expect more. And for the price they are asking for from venders is great. If you buy it at the original price of $39.00 your gonna regret it. Remember for Beginers!
5,Maxtor Ultra HDD,Drive was as promised formated out nicely works Great. shipping was a bit slow but it did get here....
3,"Ok, but still leaves bulges in the shoulders.","I purchased these based on all of the positive reviews and am slightly disappointed. I have quite a few thin cardigan type sweaters that wrinkle if I fold them, and get shoulder bulges in them if I use a regular hanger. Well, these hangers do the same thing, only the indent is wider! I think these will work better on thicker sweaters."
1,Won't work,I bought this product and thought I could use it with my new horizontalrouter table. It won't fit in the table slot. I would like to return itfor a smaller dia. bit.
5,"Beautiful and moving, but not for all tastes","This is a film you are going to either love or hate. There is quite a bit of graphic violence (World War I trench warfare), particularly in the first fifteen minutes or so, but much of this film is definitely from a female viewpoint, and plot revolves around the protagonist's quest to find her missing lover. Without being preachy, this in an anti-war film that shows war as ugly, cruel, and rather pointless. The only thing I have seen that is rather like this was the English Patient -- sort of a chick flick with explosions. If you really loved the English Patient, you will probably love this."
4,three imaginary girls from seattle.....,"What the hell kind of review is that? Stop wasting everybody's time, moron. Glad you got turned on to drugs in college (who cares?); it's a shame they didn't assist you in searching for any good bands. You don't know anything about Pavement, and it is blatantly obvious (since Helmet, of all bands, is your yardstick for music?!?!) that you're not much of a music fan, or shall I say, ""good"" music. Pavement is in such a different league than those complete dorks. And maybe you should know that Scott Kannberg (of PSOI) was not the main songwriter in Pavement. What a waste of time reading your idiotic opinion. Get a clue before you write a review again...PLEASE!"
4,What a bargain! Pistachio colored not sage though..,"I love the Divatex sheets and duvet sets. I bought sage, which is really pistachio green, and pink, which has a peachy tone so I have to dye it, but love the quality of the fabric. Also have white and canvas. My favorite is the canvas, a nice middle of the road taupy brown with no yellowy undertone. The shams are huge and easy to get on king size pillows."
4,"Superbly written, a wonderful 1st novel!","This is not the ""erotic thriller"" it is billed as. Make no mistake--there is explicit sex. However, it's in context and keeping with the incredibly sinister, yet believable, character Reese creates for the book's villain; ""M."" Her ability to intertwine non-fictional people and places with fictional scenes is a sophisticated tool in developing a plot that is quite real. The book left me wondering if the story were, in fact, true. More please!"
2,Details....Details... And more details...,"I really enjoyed Panic Snap by Laura Reese, but I was very disappointed in Topping From Below. I think she spent way too much time describing things that were not important. She spent literally pages describing bushes, weather, clothing, scenery, etc. In my opinion, it was a waste of the whole Sunday it took me to read it. But hey, to each his own!"
2,Best Enjoyed By Armchair BDSM Players,"Those that will appreciate this book most are the ones who enjoy BDSM from the safety of their armchairs. Those who actually live the BDSM lifestyle will most likely find this book to be offensive and downright degrading. The basic tenet of BDSM is that all play must be ""safe, sane and consensual"" and you'd be hard pressed to find even the heaviest ""edge"" players willing to partake in some of the scenes described in Reese's book. Aside from the ridiculous portrayals of BDSM (M. is not a true dominant, he is simply deranged), the protagonist is completely insipid and the storyline is predictable down to its final twist and turn."
3,"Alright, but not her best work","Really good book, but I was disappointed. I read Panic Snap first and it blew me away. The secret life every girl wants but can only read about. I suggest you read Panic Snap weather you liked Topping from Below or not."
3,A few surprises along the way.,"This book in an interesting read if for no other reason, than the killer is not easily identified. I disagree with the reviewer who felt that the last 20 pages were like having a rabbit pulled out of a hat. I wasn't buying the way the story was going. My biggest problem with the book is that while its obvious that Nora needed theraphy herself, what kind of person would continue a sexual relationship with a man who was into child porn and sex with animals. I can buy the bondage and domination and all of that but the other stuff, just made me want to vomit."
1,Ugh,"This is the story of two sisters, and their tangled relationship with the same man, music professor ""M.""The first sister is completely free of any compelling attributes. She's possibly the blandest ""heroine"" a novel has ever had. Insipid, ugly, boring, even the author clearly disdains this poor non-entity of a character. The only reason she exists in the book is so she can be killed.The second sister (the supposedly beautiful, vivacious and brilliant one), finds her oaf sister's diary and realizes the mysterious ""M"" is the likely killer. What does she do? If you guessed ""something sensible"" you are dead wrong. She decides to seduce him to find out more. Mind you, she KNOWS he is a sex maniac, and possibly a regular maniac. She STRONGLY SUSPECTS he has murdered her own sister in some horrific way. She takes no precautions, has zero plan or mode of escape or self defense. But what the heck.A maddening book, poorly paced and full of tragic idiots. The sex scenes are OK."
3,ENGROSSING AND EROTIC,"From the first chapter I was hooked. The author has managed to meld mystery with a touch of erotica like I've never read before. Well written, believable, interesting characters. Be warned however that the graphic nature of the erotica borders on pornographic at times."
2,Topping From Below,I usually cannot put a book down once started. I have not been able to complete this book it is so boring. If I wanted to read a murder mystery I would buy a good one. I would not recommend this read. I've read slave books that were interesting. This one is not but I find it offensive to women. After all who is so stupid as to become lovers with the man she suspects of murdering her sister?
2,Don't bother-,"I really didn't find this book all that enjoyable. It's not really all that erotic and it's rather long-winded. Definitely not the five stars I've been seeing. If you want true erotica to get your juices flowing, look elsewhere."
5,bottle drying rack,"Best purchase ever! We waited way too long to purchase a drying rack. Lots of space, drains right into the sink."
4,saves space holds tons,"I love this rack. It holds a ton of stuff in relatively little counter space (which is a big deal for me). My one objection is that mildew builds up under the spinning rack because the bottom doesn't drain or dry well in our humid climate. To solve that problem, I regularly put the whole thing in the dishwasher. I rubberband the spikes together and seperate the levels and toss it in. To date I haven't had a problem doing that to it. No melting or cracking. It's holding up well. Recommend this rack!"
4,cute and sturdy,"nice design, cute ( I got white), simple, & does what it should. Def would recommend. 4 stars because the top thing got stock & I cannot remove it, LOL"
5,excellent,"The shopping experience is very good, everything was great no problem with the product and the product is very good thanks."
3,So so,"I don't love this product but it gets the job done. My biggest complaint is that it's very flimsy and the plastic rods that hold the bottles tend to fall off a lot so, the bottles fall to the ground and I have to resterilize it. So, yeah, not a good purchase."
4,very well designed product,"This is a surprisingly well-designed product. It basically does what it says, but what I really like about it is way it folds down. The top-level platform can collapse all the way down so you have a single-level drying rack. The pins that hold up the bottles all come off and fit in the drip tray which doubles as a pin storage bin that clips to the bottom of the rack. Even the center column clips underneath (though that's a little loose).My only quibble is that I wish the drip trap clipped into the unit when it's in drip-tray mode."
5,Useful and space saving,"I like this as it's very versatile and can hold all kinds of different bottles. I'm a new mom so I've already bought several different kinds of bottles trying to find one that won't give my baby nipple confusion! So this rack has held playtex ventaire bottles, medela breast pump parts, nuk, dr browns, etc...."
4,Great if you're a pumping mama!,"I love putting my pumping parts in this rack (along with bottles and nipples). Also nice after using the steaming bag and putting them on the rack to dry. The turning is a nice feature to access space. I usually shake of stuff before putting it in so I don't really ever see water in the drip tray, I think it dries before even getting that far. Mine, though, is little crocked no matter how I put the center rod, no biggie though."
4,Good,It is very good to use and takes us little counter space. Good for people who do not have a lot of space to spare in their kitchen. And the spinning helps to look and store quickly.
2,flimsy and unstable,"this thing is so poorly designed--it never really felt like it was completely snapped in even though there was nothing else to do. after 9 months of use, the top rack would collapse on the bottom one if it was just breathed on. the whole thing falls over too really easily too b/c its center of gravity is too high."
1,"Pick another one, anything but this!","We originally registered for this and are still using it but have not liked it at all. The top rack is not sturdy at all and always collapses onto the bottom rack and the nipples/bottle lids always come tumbling off. If I could do it all over again, I would have just paid a little more for something a little more durable."
3,Swan Place,"Swan Place was a surprise. The twist of the story with love,death,unlikely friendships,birth, and demographics of era made every chapter a gift. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in historical fiction of the USA.I give this book 5 stars."
1,joyce vedral,"this is such a disappointing dvd. I watched it once and does not want to use it anymore..If I can only return this dvd. So boring, it is just like somebody who used a handycam and film herself. I wish I would not have bought this."
1,Bad Form!,"I was extremely disappointed in this video. I was using the Joyce Vedral book ""Fat Burning Workout"" and was looking for a video or dvd which would show me the correct posture and form for free weight lifting.Joyce lifted the weights with very very poor form and anyone copying her moves will injure their shoulders - especially when doing side and front laterals.I would not recommend this to anyone."
4,DVD review,"Started working out using this DVD and some light weights. A little over a week and I am already seeing progess. It can be a little tedious at times but overall, Joyce's workout get's results."
2,Extremely disappointing.,"An overwrought collection which should be avoided by newcomers and die-hards alike, WORKSHOP OF THE TELESCOPES, offers too much and too little at the same time. There is little of any value here for the dedicated BOC fan - a mere handful of unreleased tracks that would have largely been better left in the vaults and a questionable selection of ""hits"" from BOC's catalogue. Any curious fan may be turned off by the large number of tracks from the group's latter period. A much better introduction would be either the concise best-of recently released by Columbia or the group's first three albums, which can often be found packaged together at a bargain price. These along with AGENTS OF FORTUNE effectively capture BOC at their best. To the dedicated fan - leave this expensive set on the shelf and wait for a better set of rarities."
3,Baby music?,"I really can't imagine how a baby would feel about this. How young can they perceive the emotions of music, and can it upset or disturb them? Or will it simply not have the soothing effect that you're looking for in a naptime/bedtime CD? The farthest back I can remember is age 2, and at that time sad or angry-sounding music upset me easily. But perhaps before that age we don't have the necessary empathic perception skills yet to be bothered by it. I would suggest being aware of your baby's reactions if you play this (or any of the other darker-sounding rockabye renditions) for them - i.e. take note if they start having nightmares or seem otherwise scared or upset :P"
5,Not for your average baby,"I purchase this cd for my newborn newphew, who was name Trent after NIN. My sister and her husband love it! They said they don't mind playing it because they can sing along with the music."
1,Seriously derivative and in need of editing,"This author would have been best advised to rethink the grandiosescope and style of his essay. Beyond the reductive and strictrepetition of Art Bell, Roy Masters, and Krisnamurti, Mr. Karczewski'sremarks are disconnected, incoherent, and suggest little understandingof what it is to write an effective essay. Even the most basicstructures of competent writing are wholly missing from this attempt,and demonstrate a total lack of commitment to excellence and originalthinking. ""Ark"" Enterprises...has doneMr. Karczewski a serious disservice by having the text printed withouthaving it edited and reviewed by people experienced in writing andpublishing. ...."
1,Verbal flatulence at it's worst,"What a terrible book! My wife found it at a garage sale for a dollar and at first I was intrigued... how can you go wrong for a dollar. Now I believe she was overcharged.The book is poorly written by an author who appears to be more interested in promoting the number of ""big words"" in his vocabulary than providing any insight into giving oneself a mental overhaul. I'll give him this much, he seems interested in the subject matter, but he isn't sufficiently well read to offer his own rendering.My advice to this author is to first learn about the material before writing about it and second, find a publisher who provides professional editing services prior to release."
5,I give it 7 stars :),"My daughter is 16 months today. I have been using this since maybe she was nine months. My baby has very curly hair, and it has to be styled immediately after coming out of the tub. The baby normally wears bush-balls or pony tails with twists. Heck, you can even do hand-roll twists with the hair milk. I really thank God for this product because I do not support putting a bunch of garbage in her hair, and I appreciate the fact that it is safe for young babies. I normally order it once per month, but I believe I need to start doubling my order because I start to panic if we run out. Lisa, thank you for this wonderful product. Oh, the ingredients are the best, and it conditions too."
2,not too thrilled with this product,"i had to try this item out after reading all the reviews.so far after several tries - i am not too impressed.the positives: a little goes far, it does hold the style and is great for styling and wrapping up hair before bed.the negatives: the smell (although it does fade), doesnt add moisture, the price, its a bit heavy (i dont like product build-up).i may change my mind as my natural hair grows in more and i change my hairstyles - but this isnt the 'miracle' product i thought it was."
5,Love this product!! Thanks much!!,I just recently started using this product. I love how it makes my natural black hair feel. I like the smell also!
2,Too Much Water in this product.,Would not buy this product again because it has too much water in it and makes my particular hair frizzy .
3,Good product but....,Thus product has a very nice texture (not to oily and or greasy and it does not weight the hair down as similiar moisturizers do) and scent to it. However it is too expensive and you can find something just as good for about a third of the price. My advice...give it a try only if you are dying to try something from the Carols Daughter prodcut line (as it has been raved about)but do not expect too much more from the product than you could get from a comparable beauty supply product(s).
5,very good movie,the is a very good movie. i happen to be a fan of harry potter and seening 3 of my favitor people appear in the last september made the movie even better.
2,What's the Point?,"When I look at a movie or read a book, I'd like there to be a theme and a point to the end of the two hours I've lived while watching a story. Either it was one of those ""I don't get it moments"" or there wasn't a point to the story. The ending left me dry, unsatisfied, and frustrated. The story was a superficial exploration of a variety of lives and times, none of which were done in-depth or with character substance. The story floated but never went anywhere."
4,Dizmas...going for God,"Dizmas has great lyrics, great music and - hey, great guitar PLUS they are doing all they can for God... what more could you ask for?"
5,Outdated but important,"While some of the methods described have faded out of sight (primal scream therapy, est, etc) this book is still a useful (and entertaining) tool in analyzing the continuing flim-flammery of popular psychology. While expressing sensitivity towards those seeking help with real emotional and mental difficulties, Rosen questions the power and effectiveness of pop psychologists and their painful, expensive, and often humiliating methods."
3,Great CD poor indicator of actual performance,"The Kaplan CD contains by far the best available software next to that distributed by PowerPrep itself. The section tests, diagnostic test and study aids contain all the information one could need.However, and this is a big however, the full length tests have proven to be a pitiful indicator of actual ability. This is coming from someone who feels insu;ted by the score they received on those tests. I received scores that were consistenetly 150 - 200 points lower on Kaplan's test than on either Princeton Review's or on the actual PowerPrep tests handed out by the GMAT people. All this accomplished was to make me paranoid and insecure before the test which turned out to prove that Kaplan's scoring system was flawed."
1,I rate this book low because it didn't have a naturl flow.,"I would rate this dook low becuase although it had one or two exciting parts the majority of the book was confusing or the auther would stay with one topic too long which would cause the flow of the book to be disrupted. In this book Douglas Spaulding , a 12 year old boy , that has to deal with many hardships. Which are , his grandmother dieing , his best friend moving away and to him the end of summer. He does has is highpoints too , for example he discovers many ideas that he thinks he has thought up of on his own. Some of those ideas were , that older people were never young or when the authour decribes how Doug feels that he is alive. To me that whole statement about becomming alive was a confusing section to me. Finally , I would not recomed this book because the downsides out weighed the interesting parts , but overall if you like Ray Bradbury's work then by all means read the book."
1,Not Ray's best.,"After reading The Illustrated Man and Fahrenheit 451, I decided to read Dandelion Wine. This book was, um, bad(should i go that far?) because there was not enough to make me want to read more. The book is, as we say, boring. No action, no drama, no nothing. There is an interesting topic about a Happiness Machine, but that was all that was able to catch my attention. Having a child read this book is like giving the death penalty to a man that jay-walks; it's not right. I am 15 yrs. old, and have the attention span of a monkey at a zoo. And this book requires patience, something most every teen does not have, along with grammatical skills. I was forced to read this in summer school. Maybe this book would be better if I didn't have to read it in class. In conclusion, if you're elderly, read this book, it'll bring back good memories. If you're young, go outside and shoot some hoops or something, because there is no way in heck you'll be able to enjoy this book in the summer."
4,Pretty Good Book,"So far I have enjoyed reading Dandelion Wine. It is an excellent book that keeps you wondering and wanting to find out what happens next, full of magic and mystery. Young Douglas Spalding in the summer of 1928 has discovered that he is alive; he is learning to truly treasure life and to love his childhood as well as anticipate the years to come. Bradbury has a very poetic writing style which makes the book a nice read. Read this book to go on a wonderful summer journey, Bradbury's use of descriptive words will help you to feel like your actually seeing all the excitement going on in little Green Town. You'll learn to think about the small things in life and appreciate nature, You'll notice all kinds of things that you never really took the time to see before."
2,Boring...,"This book has a few interesting parts, but the rest is boring. If you are older it might be interesting but for teens and young adults it will probably be very boring for you."
4,BIG TIMS REVIEW,"I thought the book was good for younger people because it has many stories that younger people can relate with because everyone goes through them in life. i like the stories about Doug's and Tom summer childhood stories, this made me think about when i was yonger and how i also love summer. there was no school in summer and you could always play outside and as a kid you were never bored you were always having fun and finding new adventures. in the story i think i can relate to or remember something similiar in my life, to just about everyone of the stories that Doug and Tom had. it seems that all younger kids do the same stuff during the summer and have the same memories about the summer. i definetly think this book is worth reading because while reading it, it make you bring back your childhood memories and you think of all the fun you had while you were younger, it makes you feel all warm and happy inside."
5,Dandilion Wine,Wonderful story of an era (not the actual time frame of the story)that I can still remember and which is so lost in today's world.
1,Book's with no point,"This book seems to be very boring. I haven't read it but all of my friends tell me that they don't understand it at all. I can't see why all of these people thought that it was a good book. But yes, we all have different viewpoints. I don't even see why all these author's like to wrie such boring books!"
3,This one's worth reading,"Bradbury does an excellent job of capturing the feeling of summer. People of all ages can relate to the smell of cut grass, the taste of ice-cream on a hot day, catching fireflies, picking berries, and all the other typical events of summer. The vivid images in the book brought me back to the carefree, enjoyable summer days of my childhood. Reading this book helped me to recall my experiences as a tweleve-year-old. Dandelion Wine touches on some important aspects of life such as growth and the reality of death. It was a good book, but at some parts it was difficult to remain interested. It would have been better if there was more organization and flow to the book. It was all over the place and that is what caused me to loose interest. Despite this weakness, overall it was worth reading."
4,Pretty Impressive Book,"I had never read any books by Ray Bradbury and knew of him only as a science fiction writer. I went into the book thinking of it as a science fiction book and was not excited at all about reading the book. The book started off slow and didn't have much activity until the end of the book. The more I read of the book, the more I wanted to read the book. By the last 30 pages or so, I could hardly tear myself away from the book. It was very well written, packed with discription. This book brought back many childhood memories of endless summers, non stop excitement, childhood innocence, and curiosity and exploration of life in general. Being 18 and reading this book will have a different meaning than someone who reads it at 40 or 50, but it is an enjoyable book for all to read."
5,Oh to be young again.,"This book magically captures the excitement and wonder ofbeing young. It takes us into everyday life and gives us afresh look at what makes it magic. You can smell the grassand the dust, and feel the heat. Every time I read thesestories I want to be there with Bradbury in the Illinois ofhis childhood and see it with his eyes. Luckily, all I haveto do is read them again."
2,"Nostalgia, Nostalgia, Nostalgia","I suppose it is because I am young that I don't partiularly find this book all that interesting. Bradbury seems to be reaching to find his childhood. I didn't find anything that struck a nerve to me. I'll read it 30 from now and see how I feel then. For now, I'll stick with ""Farenheit 451."""
2,book condition,"The book was rated as"" like new"". However, it is far from that. The pages have worn corners and also some water marks. I would not buy from this seller since I did not receive what I was promised."
3,Dandelion Wine,"Not as great as folks say it is, though it's a fun read. Kind of like a Mark Twain with too much sun. My copy was autographed by Ray Bradbury, and that wasn't even why I bought it, because it wasn't advertised that way."
3,Dandelion Wine Review,"I liked this book. It was about a 12 year old boy who realized that he was changing and his body was changing with him. This was not my favorite book, but it had a good lesson to it. I am glad that I got to read it. That is all I am going to say about it though, because I don't want to spoil it for you."
3,Dandelion Wine,It was a good book. Except it got a little hard to read at some points but other than that it was a great book.
2,A Boring Book,"I felt that this book had its ups and downs, mostly downs. At times I'd have to admit that it was catchy and interesting but then it had its times when a chapter would just go on about absolutely nothing. For example, in chapter ten it is all about the mom worrying and trying to find her son, boring. I think that if they changed the book and took out the boring parts by adding interesting or adventurous themes, people would enjoy it a lot better. Maybe I see this book differently than others, but that's just my own opinion. I would rather recommend this book to adults because it skips around, making it hard to follow when at the same time being boring."
5,his words are a mix of poetry and paintings,"Ray Bradbury's book Dandelion Wine is a beautiful memory of a childhood. I am 15 years old, and I can really relate to Douglas Spaudling and his fear of change and death. Even though there are a few dark spots in the book, the overall point is about living, really living, about everyone's desperate will to be alive. I love the chapter about the new tennis shoes. Bradbury works his magic once again there, and I promise you that you'll never think of shoes the same way again. I will go back and read this book many times over, crying and laughing through this unforgetable summer of 1928."
4,"Great Product, Check your item numbers",This was such a good deal. The only problem was that I chose the wrong item number and that was my fault. I didn't discover it until I opened the package. These do not have wires to stick the pin it. These are for snap on wires. I had to get an attachment from my doctor's office and they worked out fine. These are great for people with sensitive skin. Good shipping.
2,Target Audience is Catholics...,"I bought this book as someone who is not Catholic (or any denomination of Christianity for that matter), however, I am familiar with several Christian denominations. I bought this book with the hope to learn more about Catholicism, however, the author assumes that the reader is a Catholic who doesn't really know what Catholics believe and spends the book trying to set Catholics straight on Catholicism. Not what I expected after reading the summary."
4,A helpful guide for those in your care,"I bought this book a few times in the past - for myself, and to give away - as it is a good source for quick and useful information. I like how it is simple, broad and approachable, yet authoritative and clear. It's just the type of work that is perfect for new Catholics or young teens proceeding through Confirmation. True, it's no 800 page tome with every dogma, doctrine and precept in it, but it's very good at what it does - clears up misconceptions & explains what Catholics really believe. I highly recommend this simple but useful book!"
4,Something every Catholic should read,"Although Keating's book does not provide much in the field of substance and thorough research, it is a useful tool to defend the faith. This book is primarily directed at Catholics who often have a very poor understanding on their faith. Catholics who dont have the time to learn about their doctrines and dogmas should take the time to read this book. It is a very simple read, shouldn't really take more than a few hours to read. It should be enough to secure the faith of many Catholics who don't know their Church very well. If given to every Catholic in the US, this book would dramatically reduce the flow of Catholics to various Protestant groups especially low church fundamentalists and evangelicals.However, if one wanted to enter the field of apologetics, this book is not enough. It may serve as a primer before you get into an actual introduction to apologetics book such as Fr. Mario Romero's ""Unabridged Christianity"""
4,An excellent reference,"Keating's writing style is wonderful for any one to grasp. This book allows for ready answers to questions that often come up, and allows the reader to offer answers to others in words that my not be so handy to those that are not as gifted verbally as Keating."
4,"A fine collection of ELO's hits, but...","...where's the three Top 20 hits from Xanadu(I'm Alive, All Over The World, Xanadu)? I guess because that soundtrack was on a different label they couldn't use those songs here. So I suggest that you get STRANGE MAGIC & XANADU(side two is all ELO songs), and that should be fine for most fans. Oh, and you may want to pick up the remaster of ELDORADO as well. I think that if you're not a huge fan like me, these discs will suit you just fine. Stay away from the ELO single-disc hits collections--they don't do the band justice.Note: For an even better overview of ELO's career, including all the UK hits, get the ""Light Years"" 2-cd set. ELO had several Top 10 hits in the UK that don't even show up on ""Strange Magic""!"
2,a bit short of the mark...,"Well, it's a good story that falls a bit short of the mark... This movie could have been so much better. The fight scene in the bar was awful... The ending plain crash was just stupid, my 15 year old daughter could do better with Lightwave 3D and Adobe... It's cool if you live in one of the cities to see some of the locations they filmed in. You can tell it's a movie because the cars did not fall into Spokane's bottomless potholes and the actors where not harassed by transients begging for money or cigarettes every 5 seconds."
2,Nothing Special,"The dish serves it's purpose, but is not a thick or heavy design. My dogs had no propblem chewing them up. The lip is easy for the dogs to latch on to.I question the significance of the ""anti-microbial"" claim. Microbes of concern are not partial to eating plastic anyways, and will still feed and proliferate on any organic residue in or on the dish."
4,"A haunting, captivating score. To-the-point, but highly effective","Track listing:1) Seattle, 19742) The Tram (Main Title)3) Ceci Wanders4) The Drip Stain5) Flotsam6) Deluge in 10F7) Mom From Hell8) A Ghost in the Machine9) New Nightmare10) Hello Again Kitty11) The Water Tower12) The Sacrifice13) Final Elevator14) End CreditsTotal time: 42 minutesAngelo Badalamenti has done an exceptional job with this soundtrack score. I would describe the music as haunting, gripping, subtle and chilling. Basically, what one would expect from a score of this genre. Although there are no real surprises, the music gets the job done of creating the perfect atmosphere for the film. Many songs start off softly and slowly build up. I don't give it 5 stars for the simple fact that it's somewhat predictable. But I'll reiterate that as a whole, it's worth getting if you're into this type of score.Long live Jennifer Connelly."
5,Great Wrangler Wipers!,"I really like these wipers, they were easy to install and work great for my Jeep. It is difficult to find good wipers in stores for my front windshield due to the smaller size. Highly recommended, no skips and no smearing. Definitely going to purchase again.Vehicle Type: 2006 Jeep Wrangler Rubicon"
1,Too short for 1991 Toyota truck,I ordered these because they were offered when I specified new wiper blades for my 1991 Toyota truck. They are about 5-6 inches too short.
5,A must for all Wa-Hoos!,I've been searching everywhere for this CD. All UVA students and alumni will be singing these tunes and the praises of Amazon.com for having this CD. A UVA Mom!
2,Super cat has done better,"Super cat is the ""Don Dadda"" and by no means a rookie in the dancehall scene. Unfortunetly this album ""The struggle continues"" allows too much pop influence to dictate its contents, maybe it is because of the non reggae label ""Columbia records"" That has influenced it. I would recommend other older albums such as ""Sweets for my Sweets and ""Si Boops-deh"" to give the listner the altimate of Super cat. Some songs on this album are extremely good. Those are: ""Too Greedy"" ""A class rub a dub"" and ""Warning"""
3,less creamy & MISSING ALLERGEN INFORMATION,"Without the emulsifiers, this tastes less creamy and breaks crisper when bitten. I like the flavor. However here is the missing allergen information:on the wrapper it says:Made in a facility that processes milk, nuts, soybeans or wheat."
2,not what I expected,I bought this as a gift for a person who enjoys dark chocolate. I thought it would be a gift that she could enjoy as candy. Probably my mistake. The bars are very rich and could be used for baking but not as candy. My error but still not what I expected when I ordered them.
5,Tragic Masterpiece,"In the early nineties pop-grunge seattle based band Nirvana were topping the charts and in turn becoming one of the most populer bands in recent times.A lot of other seattle based grunge bands took this oppurtunity to hitch a ride and become rich and famous.Yet the Screaming Trees stay in the shadows the whole time, this is most unfortunate because in my opinion they were the crown jewel of the whole genre.And even with their lead singer working with some of the most popular bands today eg. Queens of the Stone Age the Screaming Trees still get minimal radio or television play.In my opinion this is the definative grunge album, as well as one of the best rock albums of the nineties.Just buy it I promise you won't be disapointed"
4,TV edit?,"75 minute version: Full length film. Absolutely first rate. Perhaps my favorite of any western, ever.54 minute version: TV edit, done in the 1960's. Cut to run for one hour, with commercials. This is the version usually available nowdays. Not good at all. Important plot developments removed.The 75 minute version is out there, if you look hard enough."
3,80's Beauty Queen Shows How She Keeps Her Crown,"Very interesting book. Focuses on not winning a crown, but maintaining the look you had when you won with tips on eating at luncheons, looking good despite traveling, and some outdated fitness tips."
1,sad,"Dont buy this it is very boring. and not woth the time or money. Unless you want to here for the billionth time why signing is good.However, if you are planing to buy a sign video you most likely already know that."
2,Too lightweight for the comprehensive beginner's book.,"While this book covers a lot of territory in only 160 pages, too often the author simply says for the beginner to do something with inadequate, or no, instructions. After buying this book I'm now looking for another, more textbookish book on the subject. Before passing up this book, consider that it has been around since 1969, and survived 29 printings. Also, it is one of the very few books that Amazon has in print on this subject."
2,Tart taste,"I have been riding for about 1.5 years (average 30 - 40 miles - 17-18 mph). Once I got over 25 miles decided to enhance my liquid replentishment with a solid - purchased these, ""GU"" gel and ""GU"" chomps all at the same time so I could try side by side. All appeared to have helped me from hitting the wall equally, but the gel and chops go down easier. These beans are smaller - thus need to ingest more/more often to make same impact and are ""tarter"" and not as easy to swallow. I bought I case of these so will choke them down, but of the three, I like the chomps better. Ride safe"
1,No review for watermelon because i recieved Cherry instead!!!!,This is for the cherry flavor not watermelmon which is what i ordered. Cherry taste good for a few seconds then has a bad after taste. Easy to eat.
3,stability may also be an issue,"today i discovered that my new nikon D3200 appears to have a much heavier mirror than the d40x it replaced. the upshot of this is that although the tripod was good enough for the d40x, it's not stable enough to hold the d3200: i get consistent and consistently-oriented camera shake at all speeds slower than 1/200.the feet do pop off.i haven't broken any of the locking clasps. yet."
1,Watch this and weep,This is completely bonkers - the kind of thing that would make Christianity a laughing stock were its political implications not so sinister.
3,Good Overview- Buy Used,"I read ""Aesthetics"" when it was assigned for a graduate level course on 'Aesthetics and Critical Judgment'. I was able to read the entire book within a week since Sheppard takes care to lay out her points simply and relate them to common experience.The first half of the book contains visual art examples with black & white plates to refer to, while the second half focuses on literary and some film examples. She attempts to summarize Plato, Tolstoy, Kant, E. D. Hirsch and others' theories regarding aesthetics and judgment, so her book serves as a good overview or introduction to the philosophy of art like the subtitle suggests.Overall, I didn't find the book as interesting as reading other secondary sources on philosophy or even the primary sources. I'm glad I purchased the book Used, because neither it, nor many other 154-page paperbacks are worth the $40+ new price."
4,Great Read,"As to the previous review recommending not to buy this book, BALONEY!Both fun and perceptive, honest and revealing, not just of Mr. Dunne's life, but of the much desired 'glamorous' So. Cal. lifestyle. No wonder his articles on the OJ trial were so compelling."
4,a wonderful illustrated memoir of the author and hollywood,Enjoyed Dominick Dunne's book very much. Loved reading about his family and their relationships with all the interesting Movie Stars of this glamorous Era. A riveting account of a life with the Stars and a personal comeback from a life almost lost.
5,X is for Excellent,"Great film. Impressive commentary. Stunning visuals. Glimpse of the future, perhaps? Vivid slice of the present, without question."
1,A Big Let-Down,"I for one expected great things from this film.I enjoyed The Matrix greatly, and even liked the sequels, to a lesser extent.But this movie is an absolute train-wreck (no pun intended).I am glad I rented and didn't purchase, but I am not happy about being out 4 bucks over the rental, it really wasn't worth it.It had a pretty good opening, Hugo Weaving's character is well-played, and there were a couple good scenes, and special effects,however, Natalie Portman's poor acting ability, a meandering pace, and the most anti-climactic finale I've ever seen totally ruined this movie for me. Also, too many coy and sophmoric jabs at the current situation in America, were in bad taste and ridiculous.I would actually give this 2 stars, but it seems so many fools around here try to hyper-inflate reviews by bombing them with 5 stars.No one in their right mind could honestly give this incredibly flawed film 5 stars. Because it is honestly terrible.So here's my bomb, a big, fat, F."
1,C for Crap,"Where do I start? The story line tries too hard to create a web of intrigue, instead it weaves a web of forced tie-ins and the relationships between past characters and the present story line falls together far too easily. The fight scenes are badly rehearsed, they are few and far between and not exciting. There are sometimes endless dialogues which are over acted and really drag the movie out an hour longer than has to be. The end is anticlimactic with everything falling inot place way too easily. Natalie Portman is good but her agent should be fired for letting her star in some of these pictures."
5,"""Vengeance is the only verdict""","This is an amazing movie,great story of a revolution against a fascist government and where the line can be drawn between freedom fighter and anarchist"
4,"Great movie, garbage propoganda",Wonderful entertaining movie. Simple political analogies weigh the movie down. I believe in tolerance not forced recognition. Problem is the downtrodden thrive to turn the tables rather then line then up evenly. Fire for fire. Violence for violence. Revenge is the function of vendetta. Ultimately this movie fails in its noble cause but works as a source of entertainment.
4,It Dosent Have A Main Menu,"Other than that its great, lots of features good presentation & its a great movie to which is the most important part i def. reccomend this blu ray movie"
4,4 stars,"Awesome. Aside from sin city, this is the best comic-to-movie translation (having not read anything prior to the film.) Also, it had a good story and a clear message that wasn't ruined by some fantastic hollywood one liners."
5,Excellent and engaging,"I thought this was a great movie, very unique and entertaining. I would recommend it to anyone!"
2,Bakunin vs. The Batman,"If you are under the age of 18, this movie will strike you as a profound and thought-provoking metaphor for today's events. If you are under the age of 22, but a late bloomer, it may also strike you as profound and thought-provoking. If you happen to be just under the age of 30, it will make you nostalgic for a short time ago, when a movie like this would strike you as profound and important. But if you are over the age of 30, and it's been a while since you argued Bakunin and Kropotkin in the dorm, you will find yourself wishing for a little more complexity for your entertainment dollar, like you once found in Batman and Superman comics..."
4,Not what I expected,I was entertained. Natalie Portman did a great job. Wish the ending were a little different but don't want to give too much away.
4,Perfect explanation for 9/11,"This movie in not so subtle tones explain how a government creates a fake terroist attack to instill fear and patriotism into its people. Hmmm, just like the true story of 9/11.50 percent of New Yorkers now believe that the government knew or was involved in the 9/11 attacks so they would have a reason to wage war and take away civil liberties.Good job boys."
3,V with Natalie Portman and Hugo Weaving,"One message of the movie, which to me seemed to center around the evil of dictatorial control of a society and the bravery required to rescue that society, did come through. But one would have to assume that it was even possible for England to sink to that level. Given that the IRA fought the British over a much more benign type of political control, I rather doubt that the UK citizens could ever allow the country to become a dictatorship -- I believe it would be nipped in the bud early on. Yes, every-day folk can become tools of a Big Brother dictatorship. History has taught us that. Hopefully, though, we have learned from history. To the extent that you believe that, the premise of the movie is over the top."
3,Old story told fairly well.,Don't think you could get that many people to agree on anything no matter how important. Too camy for me. Maybe geared for younger audiences.
2,v for very boring,"While the movie started off rather ridiculously fake with all sorts of unusual voice acting, it eventually got better. The only problem was the entire story wasn't interesting enough to care about, so after 50% of the film went by, I really lost interest. I also didn't care for the slow motion effects showing people dying and blood squirting from their bodies. The V character was decent, but he can't save an average film. Some of the special effects were good (such as that exploding clock) but that's about the only thing worth noting I found about the film."
2,V For Vendetta,"V For Vendetta is very thought provoking, has great action scenes, and everyone played their part well. The only problem with it, for me, was that I didn't feel all that entertained. The message that it sent really made you think and it had a great story, but for the entertainment part I felt it was lacking. But I have a feeling alot of people will like it."
1,CRAP!,"This is a putrid and shocking example of irresponsibility and plain foolishness.This kind of garbage calls for censorship.Liberals, typical academia, the common celebrity, Democrats ad nauseum are all at fault for degrading America and preparing it for destruction.How foolish."
3,HD DVD version is better.,It's nice but I'll be getting the HD DVD version when my HD DVD player arrives.
5,V for Vendetta,"An awesome and haunting fantasy of the future. Excellent story, emotional musical score, and superb acting. I highly reoommend it."
1,V is nothing but a plug for terrorist apologists,"If you are a conservative Sean Hannity watching American troop supporting lover of a free and moral and decent society, you will be climbing the walls of your home theater in the same anxiety as men trying to flee the theater from Madonna's portrayal of Evita while the women forced their husbands to stay because of Antonio Banderas (from personal experience). Yes this movie has a vendetta, it is to place all the blame of terroristic acts on a decent and civil society. I cannot imagine a movie that is more of a crime against humanity and a plea for insanity and lawlessness than this one. I'm not going to say avoid this movie, I would say go see it if you are inclined to for what it really is which is Hollywood's secular humanistic pull for placing the blame of the 9/11 attacks on a western capitalist society. This movie was absolutely nauseating."
4,Question authority,"A little 1984 (George Orwell) and the real politics of today (terrorism, possible germ warfare) with imagination what the future could hold. I was enthralled and I can't help but think if I was British I would appreciate this movie more.We must be vigilant and not allow the government to get away with anything. No matter what political affiliation you have, we must keep checks in place so nothing near this can happen."
4,A Good Read,"This was the first Tony Hillerman story I ever read and years later, the beautiful imagery remains fresh in my mind.If you appreciate understated prose that lets a few choice words build an entire vista in your imagination, then Hillerman's booksabout the Navajo country and America's spellbinding southwest are for you. The themes of The Fallen Man don't stray too much fromwhat we are used to from Hillerman -- Joe Leaphorn, now retired, patiently collecting clues; Jim Chee, moving towards the same eventual directionas Leaphorn, but frustrated along the way by supporting characters, his unrequited ardor for Janet, and his own inner self; and the non-Indian characterswho fulfill the role they often do in a Tony Hillerman novel. For anyone who has come to like Leaphorn, Chee and the Four Corners, you'll enjoy The Fallen Man as much as the rest of the series."
2,Six levels?,"This game was brief so I'll be brief. It took me one week to beat even with the extra 2 missions for the PC. You don't get much for your money. Full Spectrum is virtually non-replayable. I don't understand how a developer could have had a preexisting game engine and then give you only six levels. The hard work was already done, come on guys. As for the on-line play I haven't been able to get anyone to play with me, so that is null in void. The game play should be approached more like a `Close Combat'. This is not a shooter rather is a real time strategy game. I will never buy another product from this developer unless they release some more missions for download. PS gamers, start recognizing developers. If they have disappointed you in the past then don't buy from them in the future."
2,I returned it,"There were very few helpful hints in this book. There are over one hundred pages of the book devoted to listing NASDAQ stocks! How is that helpful? It seems that someone wanted to pad the thickness of the book. In addition, I was disappointed with the misleading subtitle on the cover that says ""day trade like a pro, starting today!"" Then she contradicts that (rightly) in the first chapter by saying that she would never recommend beginning to trade after reading only one book. On the the plus side, I think this may be helpful for someone who is a very green beginner."
2,"I recommend you to see, ""Mary, The Mother Of Jesus"" instead","...These actors who played the roles of Jesus & Mary were both serious most of the time and they did not show enough love to another. I think the actors were just cold in their characters. I don't think the real Jesus and Mary would have been like that in real life. So the movie of, "" Mary, The Mother of Jesus"" & the movie of ""Jesus ""from 2000, showed a lot of what their loving characters might have been like. If you want to watch a movie about Mary or Jesus, then I HIGHLY recommend you to watch these two other movies I recommended you - I'd give them both 5 stars. This movie here, I'm not giving it a good score except 2 stars. The two stars is based on the actors performance, other than that; the movie would have been good. So, if you rather see them serious, then this movie is for you. * By the way, the movie I'm discussing is the 1995 movie film done by the same actress.*"
1,Don't waste your money,"With one wash these sheets look terrible ! Also, the elastic gives out and they will not stay on the bed. Garbage !"
2,Nice - if you only want something to last for only a cut or two,"The first time I used this, I was quite pleased - it cut well and at a fraction of the cost of those sold at my local hardware store.When I put it away, however, I noticed the locking device did not work, but that was not a problem - I don't have kids in the house to worry about them cutting themselves. The second time I went to use it, I noticed it did not seem to work as well, and I thought perhaps the branches of my shrubs might be a bit thicker than the ones I initially pruned. The third time I took it out to cut away dead plants and get my garden ready for wintering over, I found I could cut and cut and cut and nothing happened. Finally took out a pair of scissors and used them to snip off my petunias, etc.Next time I know better. I'll buy a recognized name brand AND I'll pay a bit more to know I am getting something with lasting power."
5,barnel B888 Ratchet Pruner,"Used many times, and the Pruners work great ! If any faults , it would be the sliding lock that holds the handles together is very hard to move. I suspect this will ease up with more use"
5,Amazing reference for ancient Egyptian jewelry!,"I would encourage anyone to seek out a copy of this book, it is well worth a few extra dollars considering it's out of print. The photos are exceptionally rich in color and detail, all fully labeled with dates and names. As someone looking to recreate jewelry in the style of ancient Egypt, this book has been my top resource on so many levels. It lists the multitude of stones and minerals used by ancient Egyptian craftsmen, along with the tools and techniques they practiced. The contents and sections are very well organized and easy to follow, and it includes a complete index for quick reference. This book is a treasure all its own!"
2,I was going to buy it but didn't after reading the reviews,"I would have purchased this collection IF it had a lot of Wayne's highlights from the Oiler days. If it only shows the plays we see over and over again, then I am not interested."
2,Not enough footage of Gretzky in action,"I did not get a chance to watch Gretzky play until he was near the end of his career, so I was looking to this dvd to have significant footage of Gretzky in action. It simply does not.It does provide insight into Gretzky's thoughts about his career and the NHL in general, which is interesting. Also, some of the bonus footage is decent: e.g., the 2002 Olympics segment (although again, not enough actual hockey footage); behind-the-scenes footage of the Pond of Dreams shoot."
1,Extremely disappointing,"I'm extremely disappointed in this so called ""Ultimate Gretzky"" dvd. This dvd is for new fans only. There is nothing new in terms of highlites, and very little new in terms of anecdotes. What kind of carer retrospective doesn't even mention his time with the Blues? A dvd with 3 hours of footage should have at least a few rarely seen highlites thrown in for the long time fans. I think that I'm even more disappointed by the fact the Wayne himself was one of the producers. I have the Above and Beyond video from 13 years ago and it's above amd beyond this dvd."
4,A very good retrospective of The Great One,"This is a nice DVD set and a very good review of 99's remarkable career. John Davidson interviews Wayne and the conversation between the two is smooth and never seems forced. Certain sections are introduced by Keifer Sutherland. I can't say it's a complete look at his career (nothing on his brief stint with St. Louis) which is why I didn't give this set five stars. With the exception of the game where Wayne scores his 802nd career goal (Vancouver's broadcast of the game is the one on here), all games are CBC telecasts. The games are all restored and look and sound as good as they could possibly be. You'll either like or be annoyed by the removal of a lot of the time between faceoffs of the games. A recommended purchase for Wayne's fans and all hockey fans."
4,"Very good, but lacking on the essential","Not being an expert on Gretzky's career, I really enjoyed this DVD. It sounds complete (except for Gretzky's time in a Blues uniform)and is more directed towards new and casual hockey fans.Where I was disappointed, as were many others who submitted reviews before me, was that the DVD did not contained all the amazing plays, many of us got to see only once on the news or during games. Sure they have his career defining goals, which we all saw a thousand times, but few behind the net set-ups or any amazing passes.There was plenty of room left, which was filled by bloopers and his wedding, where they could have included his 100 most amazing plays for example. Nevertheless, it is a great DVD for any hockey fan. Like one reviewer before me said, you don't need to tell people why Gretzky is called the Great One, all you have to do is show them."
2,I bought John Paul Pet Tearless Shampoo because of the reviews!,"I have two light colored Malshi's and they get baths every week or two. I've tried various shampoos that are tearless, smell good and lather up nicely. I was hoping John Paul Pet Tearless Shampoo would be the shampoo I would buy again and again but it's not. It's tearless and has an okay smell but it doesn't lather up at all. I had to use way to much when I washed them just to be sure I was getting them clean since without the lather it felt like I hadn't used any at all. I'm now filling the tub with about 5"" of water and using this shampoo as a bubble bath in between normal shampoos to use it up, since it's more of a rinse off for them instead of a regular bath. If you want a shampoo for your dogs that lathers and gets them clean without having to use copious amounts don't buy this!"
4,"Great compilation, but...","...there's not enough songs. Besides, they need a newer compilation to include more recent stuff. Here's what should be:CD 11. Hello America2. Let It Go3. Bringin' On The Heartbreak4. Switch 6255. Photograph6. Rock Of Ages7. Foolin'8. Too Late For Love9. Rock! Rock! ('Til You Drop)10. Women11. Animal12. Hysteria13. Armageddon It14. Pour Some Sugar On Me15. Love Bites16. RocketCD 21. Let's Get Rocked2. Make Love Like A Man3. Have You Ever Needed Someone So Bad4. Tonight5. Stand Up (Kick Love Into Motion)6. Two Steps Behind7. Miss You In A Heartbeat8. When Love And Hate Collide9. Work It Out10. All I Want Is Everything11. Slang12. Promises13. Back In Your Face14. Goodbye15. It's Only Love16. Now"
4,"Casual fans, listen!","I would consider myself a casual Def Leppard fan: I have a copy of ""Hysteria"" and this greatest hits package, and it's very satisfying for me. They were probably the best hair metal band of the Eighties and their hits (and nothing else) is packaged in this album. Who could ask for more? Awesome for an ol'-fashioned nostalgia party. ROCK ON!"
3,Don't Cheat Yourselves...,"This might give you a taste of some classic Def Leppard tracks, but do yourself a favor and go for the full course meal. This compilation brings in more of their recent hits, which are okay (although they seem addicted to ballads lately) but High 'n' Dry, Pyromania, and Hysteria have too many overlooked, yet brilliant tunes to forget. Spend a little more for these three albums and get some great early-mid 80s rock!"
4,Great compilation of Def Leppard's career,"This overall covers quite a bit of Def Leppard's career. It's a great showcase of songs to get any foreigner to Def Leppard obsessed with them. My only complaints are the exclusion of any on through the night material, and a lackluster ammount of high 'n dry and adrenalize material. Oh, and Der Kommissar, for your information, Rick Allen lost his left arm (not a criticism, just a friendly reminder)."
4,"So many hits, so little room",A Def Leppard 'greatest' has to be a 2-CD set. This is an awesome compliation of tunes but too many classics left out to get a 5.
4,Best Bang for Your Buck,"Probably the best and most concise collection of Def Leppard's work you could ask for. All their dumb fun metal numbers you know and love are here, including my faves ""Animal"", ""Photograph"", ""Love Bites"", and ""Bringin' on the Heartbreak"". That said, a few tracks aren't quite musical enough to keep you from noticing the rather lame lyrics - I'm thinking ""Armageddon It"" (yuk yuk), ""Let's Get Rocked"" (they claim ""it was supposed to be funny""), and ""When Love and Hate Collide"", which sounds unnervingly like Bryan Adams (I *knew* John ""Mutt"" Lange shouldn't've worked with him!). I also haven't quite gotten over my high school friend playing ""Pour Some Sugar on Me"" in the car EVERY DAY, but hey, that's personal baggage, not critique. Put it on and have some dumb fun!"
2,Most Overrated Band out there,"Just never got into these guys, never will. I got this album a few years back to keep my wife quiet. Well it's been over 2 years now since I've been divorce, and I must say along with my divorce don't have either one of these, got rid of them both. The only highlights Bringing on The...., and Two Steps Behind, that's it my friends. Just too much airplay on radio and MTV. Can you say ""COMMERCIALISM"" I knew you could."
4,Memorable,"I read this book as a high school sophomore...I can honestly say that it was one of the most inspirational books I've ever had the pleasure to read. On my college applications I wrote about it as the book that most changed my life. I was fortunate enough to find a used copy at a local library sale, and will never part with it again."
5,One of the best games out there,"Though I've only played the X-Box version, this game is to drool over. The smooth moves, slow motion, screening effects, and ahem...a nice heroine, the game is eye candy. The basic plot is too find mahjor officers of the Nazi fleet, not to mention playing with loads of fun toys, and to exterminate them. Though this game is rated M, I highly recommend it. The playtime never gets old, while most of the action games do. It's really cool to grab someone, suck their blood, use them as a human shield, and shoot at the same time. The blood rage is totally awesome. If you enjoy this game, I suggest Legacy of Kain: Blood Omen 2, though the main character isn't as cool. :-D"
2,This Flight Attendant is not too happy,You want a funny book about a Flight Attendant who LOVES her job? This is not the book. Rene Foss never claims to love her job. FLYING BY THE SEAT OF MY PANTS: FLIGHT ATTENDANT ADVENTURES ON A WING AND A PRAYER - now that's a funny book about a Flight Attendant who loves her job.
4,great light reading,Great book for quick witty stories. Great to get an insight into what goes on on the other side of aviation.
4,a trip out book,alot of interesting tales and episodes that happen and this book is a stone cold trip from start to finish. so many various encounters and situations and never knowing what will happen next. very interesting read.
2,It's True: They Really Do Hate You,"You're hungry on 12 hour flight? What's the matter with you, why didn't you pack a picnic hamper. It's transportation, not a RESTAURANT!! You're dehydrated from the very dry recirculated air and you try to get an entire can of soda instead of a little four ounce cup, why are you so greedy? You don't get the can and later go down the galley (to save putting on a call light and summoning a flight attendant, which makes her feel like servant, and according to this books some FA's just ignore call lights anyway), how dare you take up aisle room or bother the flight attendants!! Flight attendants fly for the free travel and they hate your guts. Bow low before them."
2,"Good information, but...","Good information, but unfortunately presented like an infomercial for his book. He also lost some credibility with me when he got into the ""Bible codes"". Aside from that, lots of evidence that the Bible is the truthful Word of God."
5,Dazzling Christmas!,"I recently bought this pendant for myself for Christmas - the size, color of the pearl, diamonds and chain I was very pleased with - if you want to dazzle someone, wear this pendant with a sexy black dress!"
5,The most authoritative textbook on publishing,"Mr. Greco knows the U.S. trade book publishing industry better than anyone. And he's got the facts and the figures to back it up.This book is NOT for self-publishers or small publishing operations. This is the text used by the large trade publishing companies and describes mid- to large-scale publishing operations. The text is less than 10 years old, so while it doesn't cover all of the latest and greatest on ebooks and apps, it does cover EVERYTHING else. Yes, in detail. Yes, you'll find it a little dry if ""Success for Dummies"" is your favorite business book. If you want the most authoritative answers, this is the book for you."
5,No doubt... very simple...,"Finally found a pair of these shoes after looking for a long time (had to look abroad from where I live). These shoes are basically the best shoes I've ever worn (first season of Michael Jordan basketball shoes aside). I like them so much that I bought two pairs, so that if they'd stop making these I'd have at least 2-3 years to find new shoes that I like and fit me like a glove. Ten times more comfortable that the regular Stan Smith's (the sole and the insides of these shoes are way more comfortable than the regulars).In short, let me put it this way... those two pairs I bought from Amazon - are pairs number 5 and 6 so I've been wearing these shoes for more than 7 years. As long as they keep makin' them, I'll keep buyin'em, without a doubt!"
2,Bad data transfer rate,"Hey, I have a very bad experince with my new Seagate 60GB USB 2.0 Portable External Hard Drive. It takes aroung 8-10 mins to transfer 700MB of data.. I have used couple of other HD before and that was really very good. Those HDs took less then 2 mins to tranfer the data having size more than 1 GB. I do not recomment this HDs. Even I feel like I did a mistake by buying Seagate Portable External HD. I thought that Seagate would be good. But :(.Even size of HD is also big. Its not so easy to carry. I need a bag (Laptop bag or anytg like that) to carry this HD."
2,I love Richard Clayderman but not this DVD!,I love beautiful piano music and no one does it better than Richard Clayderman. I have many of his CDs and love to listen to them. The problem with this DVD is the production value. I know it's not a bluray but I expected better sound quality. The scenes of him walking around wistfully looking pensive bordered on cheesy.
4,Love Patty,"One of the true country singers left, She does a great job on this CD. If you love country music then buy this cd"
3,Great Service,"The motherboard was shipped promptly, but unfortunately had to be returned due to a compatibility issue. I had no problems obtaining a full refund, in a timely manner. I found this company to be very responsive and professional, and would not hesitate to do business with them again."
1,Disappointing,"These are TERRIBLE transfers. Honestly, it looks like someone with a home computer took a DVD copy of the movie and just put it on a blu-ray disc. I am highly disappointed as I really love these films."
5,Very damn good,"Yes, this is not ""The Wall"" or ""Dark Side..."", but if left to gestate and resonate with the imagination, you'll find a haunting, ethereal and satisfying entry into the pink floyd catalogue. A steady journey to a distant sonic horizon where ""the grass is greener and the river flows forever and ever..."""
2,"My, how the mighty have fallen","Now, when I first got this album, I thought it was a vast improvement over Floyd-Mach-Three's last effort, ""A Momentary Lapse of Reason."" But, the more I listen to it, the more I realize it's just a bunch of boring tripe.There are good songs on the album, but not many: ""Cluster One"" is good. Good way to open an album. ""Wearing the Inside Out"" is a triumphant return to the world of vocalizing for Mr. Wright. It's a fine, jazzy tune. ""High Hopes"" is a nice way to end the Floyd's career. Very reminiscent of past songs.The rest are either poor, or listenable only. ""Keep Talking"" grates on my nerves severely. I used to like ""Coming Back to Life,"" but it's just worn thin with me. ""What Do You Want from Me"" has alright lyrics, if only they had come up with original music. ""Have A Cigar,"" anyone?Skip this. Get ""Saucerful of Secrets."""
4,Ejecucion Musical Intachable,"Si bien, el primer disco de Pink Floyd sin Waters, no fue de mi completo agrado, este disco recupera parte de lo perdido, el sonido es limpio y nitido, para todos los que amaron el wish you were here, este disco les debe gustar, canciones como ""keep Talking"" o ""high hopes"" nos muestran a un pink floyd parado en la barrera que divide la locura de lso primeros discos y el perfeccionismo que busco alguna ves en los 70....un gran disco sin duda alguna"
3,"More cohesive,but not complete...","Sounding more like a band effort than their previous 1987 offering,'The Division Bell'can be a satisfactory listening experience only if one pretends everithing is fine.But this is not the case here:again,the lyrical themes are forced and repetitive,with no clear concern behind them[cf.'The Dark Side of the Moon'(1973)or any following album up to 1983].On the bright side,brilliant studio work and excellent album artwork."
1,Pop,If you like pop music. Try this. A great pop album but not a Pink Floyd AlbumRoger Waters where are you?
1,Very nice adult contemporary muzak,"The music on TDB is perfect for the grocery store. It's smooth, generic pop music that evokes sensations of cellophane and artificial flowers and bright shiny linoleum floors and cold steel buggies. It really fits in well with our society, I think. I gave it a low rating, though, because I was expecting to hear the Pink Floyd. But now that I think about it, TDB may be a Gilmour/Mason/Wright excursion into postmodern irony. On that level, it certainly succeeds. Okay, I get it now. Well done, guys!"
3,Better than the last one!!!,"After having slated ""A momentary Lapse"", I will admit that this is better. Still not great though. It starts of really well; ""Cluster 1"", ""What do you want"" and ""Poles apart"" are terrfic and signify the best start to a Floyd record since ""Animals""; however the rest is patchy. ""Marooned"" is just a standard instrumental filler with fancy guitar playing (listenable, but with no substance), ""A great day for freedom"" is Gilmour trying to be Waters (and partially suceeding) and ""Wearing the inside out"" is a relaxing, moody Rick Wright tune with great backing vocals. ""Take it Back"" is lame, although ""Keep Talking"" is pretty solid. The album ends in great style (as it began) with ""Lost for words"" (slagging off waters??) and ""High hopes"". All in all not bad, I'm tempted to give it 4 stars - but 3.5 is more accurate."
1,A sure cure for insomnia,"Waters without Gilmour is melody-free and as mean-spirited as they come. Conversely, Gilmour without Waters is brain-dead and tedious. This record is vastly overproduced and under-composed. Somewhere along the line Gilmour even lost his beautiful guitar tone, and traded it in for a sterile-sounding roar. It's hard for me to tell one song from another on this record; the only emotion I feel is a vague sense of relief when Gilmour stops singing the dreadful lyrics he and his girlfriend concocted to bridge the gaps between aimless meanderings. Roger Waters wasn't the Pink Floyd, but this is proof that David Gilmour isn't the Floyd either. Just bloated, brainless corporate rock, as psychedelic as Quaker's Oatmeal and a lot less interesting."
3,Dignity intact,"Filled with its share of waiting-room clunk, Floyd's final bow out at least partially amended for their late 80's atrocities with occasionally inspired melodies and production combining to find that spacey spark, one last time."
3,misrepresentation,The item that I received is a good quality item but it is not what it was advertised as. It is a thermos but it is not a mug. I was lookin specifically for a mug that could be used for drinking coffee while driving to work in the morning. This item does not fulfill that need. It seems to be a good product just not what I was looking for.
2,Fun while it lasted,"I purchased one of these tubes several years ago, which was still in great shape, and wanted a matching one so the kids would stop fighting over it! Love that it is transparent, and love the colors.Arrived in good shape, but only after a few (very gentle) uses, I found it deflated in the closet with a split seam. The old one is still working great. Disappointed in what seems to be decreasing quality, and won't purchase another one."
1,"BEWARE OF LEG AVENUE""S BUSINESS PRACTICES AND MIS-REPRESENTATION",Their costumes are mis-represented and they are not honorable in their business dealings.....I have had a terrible experience trying to return a costume that was three sizes smaller than they said it was. They are rude and arrogant-
5,Charlie Daniels,"Wonderful music, excellent condition and fast delivery !!!! What more could you ask for ?"
2,I should have listened!,"OK, so here's another 'I should have listened to other reviewers' review...I just received the egg and tried to open it. I was successful, but it took much effort. I am disappointed in the egg shell, but feel ok with that since I knew that there could be a problem and chose to purchase anyway.Just wanted to note that my fabric egg is shaped like a teardrop (less than thrilled about that too) and that the egg white is not so white...its a creamy light beige color. I assume that they made the egg this color so that it didnt look filthy all of the time, but I would have rather just cut some circles out of cheap felt and replaced when necessary."
3,Not all it's cracked up to be.,"I bought two of these for my niece's birthday. The idea of cracking an egg and opening it are great, but the metal egg is hard to open without throwing it down (which dents it permanently). The cloth egg doesnt fall out of the egg very well, either. My niece still played with it alot and I know overall, she will use it over and over again."
1,Manufacturing defect,"I would definitely recommend this title except, as others have also reported, I cannot play this disc on 2 of my 3 DVD players. I think the disc is unevenly weighted or out of round. It will not load up at all on my Sony player and on my Audiovox portable, it will play but it makes the whole player shake. I have returned and tried a total of 4 discs (all from different stores) and ALL have the same problem. I would love to recommend this DVD but until Lionsgate owns up and recalls the whole bunch, I cannot."
3,Brian's Growth,"A step up from his self-titled debut, Brian McKnight has done a lot of maturing since his last ablum. He captured our attention with the spell-binding ""One Last Cry"" as if to tell the world "" Hello, My name is Brian McKnight and I can sing."" Accordingly, he futhers his statment with songs such as ""Crazy Love"" and ""Still in Love"" in I Remember You. However, what McKnight has not yet told the world is that he knows a thing or two about love that the world does not already know. I Remember You is plagued by identical love songs sung in the same chords that are only a baby-step above the songs of his counterparts . Show me that day the Brian learns more about love and I will show you the day when Brian McKnight becomes one of the greatest R&B vocalists of our time."
5,Never Gets Old! I LOVE THIS MOVIE! CLASSIC FOREVER,Amazing movie for the whole family. This movie is one of a kind and will never dull. It will be a classic till the end of time. Recommend everyone see it at least once. The television stations used to play this movie every year near the holidays. Then they stopped. Too bad. Every generation must see this movie!
3,"Good, but it's no Hidden Order","Having just read Holland's other book ""Hidden Order"", I was psyched to hear that he had written another book on the science of complex adaptive systems. This book, however, was quite disappointing. While the first few chapters were interesting, the second half of the book was a loss to me. There seemed to be too many divergent themes upon which he was trying to comment. I feel like he ran out of ideas and started just writing down anything that came to mind. The last chapter provided a good summary of the ideas he tried to express concerning emergence, but the book on the whole left more questions than it answered. If you really want to learn something about emergence and related science of complexity, check out his other book ""Hidden Order"". It's much better and a bit easier to understand in my opinion."
3,Cute...,"While this was a cute book, I didn't find it overly funny. There were 25 recipes from all over the world for cooking a mouse. It's not a book I'd purchase because I don't think I'd read it again or recommend it to anyone. There were a few recipes that were cute, such as Mouse In Black Bean Sauce, a Chinese dish that will leave your cat hungry again in an hour. And Tandoori Mouse, where Mahatma Gandhi tried to convince his cat to choose a vegetarian diet. The cat's response was: ""You know what you can do with your brown rice""."
4,Helpful for parents,"This book was recommended to me and I enjoyed it reading it. The book is helpful in understanding some of the differences between siblings and more importantly, helping parents accept the differences. Whenever I read a book about children and parenting I always wonder why it isn't a required course in High School. One word of caution, after reading this book I have been constantly guessing the birth order of everyone I meet!While I liked the book, I thought the author spent too much time defending his theories and trying to sell his other books."
3,Interesting book - especially if you have children-,"I found this book to be very interesting. It can help you better understand why certain people are the way they are and quite possibly how you can better interact with them. The book had lots of interesting tidbits such as pilots are usually first born and used car salesmen are typically last borns. The author spent a lot of time talking about his own kids which I could care less about and he plugged his other books a bit too much considering he didn't really present loads of scientific info - primarily opinions based on his ""observations"". The book was interesting though and I would recommend it to people with children or who work with children. Take the book out of the library instead of buying it b/c it's not worth the overall selling price and you'll probably only look at it at best."
4,Excellent Overall Guidance & Specific Training Tips,"The word ""comprehensive"" seems very fitting for ""Conditioning for Outdoor Fitness"" because the volume packs in a lot of background information on physiology as well as specific training regimens for particular outdoor sports. I particularly value the icons for different sports used to identify exercises that are particularly valuable for the sport you are preparing for. The final chapters provide focused training regimens for specific sports, which are cross-referenced to the exercise descriptions found in other parts of the book. The book also provides valuable tips on functional exercises that focus on combinations of muscle groups to achieve more practical training than the muscle isolation process used in many weight training machines. All in all, this is one of the very best I've seen for sport-focused training."
4,One of the better Fluid Mechanics textbooks,"""Viscous Fluid Flow"" is quite thorough and well thought out. I won't go so far as to say that it reads like a novel, but it flows quite nicely. This book is for senior undergraduate or first-year graduates. The topics contained within are quite advanced in comparison to typical undergraduate Fluid Mechanics. The only problem I had with this text is that at times (not often) the hierarchy of the topics would get jumbled. For example, the explanation for a topic might come before the topic was even introduced leading to some confusion. Regardless, this textbook is REQUIRED for the bookshelf of any serious Fluid Dynamicist."
4,"It's nice, but says 1-5/8""","Maybe it's my inexperience, but it will not cut 1.5"" PVC, not big enough and if my math is correct, I would believe that 1-1/2 is in fact less than 1-5/8 (1-4/8).. So maybe because schedule 40 PVC is thicker and thus it won't work (possible), but it will not cut PVC schedule 40 1.5"" pipe (unfortunate as that is my next project).But for the smaller stuff, it cuts clean everytime. Cut quite a bit of 1/2 PVC without issue. It's not a mechanical wonder, as there is lots of manual spreading etc. But it cuts and cuts well"
1,stay away,The boots dig into the heel of the foot. The leather is very stiff and the boots are not very comfortable.NOT RECOMMENDED
4,I wanted the same product and found it online.,This product is not found in stores now so I found it online. I tried other makeups and found this one suits me the best. The only reason I rated it a 4 instead of a 5 is because the pump is not reliable.
5,Best CD I have heard in a long time!,"I first heard ""Wasting My Time"" on the 8 Mile soundtrack, and I thought it was so soulful, but I was blown away by the album. Most actors turn musicians are complete flops, but this album is amazing. Taryn has so much passion immediately in ""The Wreckoning"" that I was just flabergasted. The whole album just takes you on a roller coaster that makes you wanna get right back on when it's over!"
3,Not the reason why I bought the album.,"Though many of us have heard and loved Boomkat's hit song, ""The Wreckoning,"" the rest of the CD does not live up to the standard given by its single. The first few tracks are what I had expected with its ghetto-like hip-pop style but the fourth and fifth tracks drags the album down in which it never recovers. The ballads aren't the reason why I had bought the album, even though her vocals are significant. Don't get me wrong, there are a few tracks worthy of mentioning such as ""Bein' Bad"" and ""What you do to me,"" but all in all, I'd like to return this if i could."
2,"Boomkat, or Boomkrap!? WTF","When I first heard the single that wanted me to get Taryn's and Kelin's CD ""The Wreckoning"" I was all over it but then I only figured there are only 2 songs I like ""The Wreckoning"" and the the 3rd single off the ""8-Mile"" soundrack ""Wastin' My Time"" Bomkat isn't good at singing but great at acting, she should stick to more acting and less singing, do not buy this album, look for the songs she sings and download them, and maybe you'll like it and buy it."
4,Lots of styles,The songs are all really catchy and they've kind of got an r&b thing going and also hip hop and pop and new stuff. I really like it.
1,not to cool,"this CD is not so cool and there is soooo many bands, independent bands that are soooo much better .... the music is monotone... nothing really happen. the singing is somewhat good in a few places but that is not enough for the full album. the production is very amatorish ... every lil' guy this days thinks that if you ad some noise you have an album ... well, you don't..."
2,Weak...but there's this one song...,"Boring. Boring. Boring. There's an hour's worth of tedium surrounding one good and one great track, ""The Wreckoning"" and ""Look At All The People"" respectively. For the most part, those are the only songs that have any sort of distinctive flavor to them...something that separates this duo from the rest of the pack. I found the album to be pretty generic in it's sound. Tired beats, nasal sassy rap-sing-song, straightforward and sometimes non-existent melodies, weak production.That being said, check out the ""Look At All The People"" track, and I'll think you'll find the promise of greatness, which makes the rest of the record so darn frustrating. They deserve watching though...I'd like to see a video..."
3,a bit disappointed,"I had been telling my infant daughter bible stories from memory, and bought this book so that I could be more accurate and have pictures to go along with the story. Unfortunately, the stories are so brief and simplistic (only a few simple sentences per story) that they are almost meaningless. This book does have a LOT of different bible stories in it, but if you are looking for an engaging read-aloud experience I would look elsewhere."
5,Perfect for little ones!,"I absolutely love this little bible! It is a great book for little ones who can't read as well as older ones starting to read. It really kept my 2 year and 4 year old's attention. Great 1st bible!! Lots of colorful pictures and the stories were perfect length, not too short and not too long where they lost attention. I've bought other 1st bibles and the stories were too short and vague and other's were too long and used bigger words that were hard for little one's to understand. This is by far the best children's bible that I have ever bought!"
3,first child Bible book,There is no Table of contents. Disappointing. The book is colorful enough for my 5 yrs to be curious. A sturdy enough for children.
4,interesting,"Objective overview of the history and prophecy surrounding Jerusalem, including mentioning the similarities and differences between how three major religions view Jerusalem and its gates and walls."
5,TOTALLY AWESOME!,This review is written by my 9 yr old daughter: This is a very amazing movie about a 13 yr old girl who lost her arm in a shark attack. It is very inspiring and amazing about how she got back up and surfed again. I love that she loves Jesus. I would recommend this for older kids because the attack was scary and there was blood.
5,"Superb movie for every family! Clean, GREAT message","If you are scared of going into the water, well this movie isn't going to help. But with that aside, Soul Surfer is a great movie with an even better message for people of all ages.This young lady's story of perseverance and determination, coupled with her family's love and support, is well told.Highly recommended.Rich NilsenPresident of All Star Press &Author ofSleep Great for Life"
3,"Breathtaking true story, but Carrie Underwood's acting sucks in this movie","This is a loving and real and breathtakingly exquisite true story. I deeply and whole-heartedly suggest reading the REAL Bethany Hamilton's own book and story. <3. The movie itself seems way too fake and too scripted, and ugh especially Carrie Underwood's lines and her acting also seems fake as heck!! Soooooooooo read the REAL Bethany Hamilton's story!!!!!!!!!!! :D :D."
5,Great family film!,"When I saw the trailer for this movie I pictured a movie like Mighty Ducks, good family film, fun, but a bit cheesy. Boy was I wrong. The movie was great! So many lessons to take away! Highly recommended.A good reminder how blessed we truly are. That even in terrible circumstances, God has a beautiful plan through those painful and confusing times. Our human time line and perspective is so short (we have an eternity to look forward to - if we know Jesus), we are so narrow focused (typically focus only on self), and we don't trust God enough (he is the creator and father that loves us). We need more films like this one!Side note: as a guy I feared that all the girls in swimsuits would be distracting, but it was filmed very tasteful and not at all distracting or suggestive (unlike so many movies that do)."
5,Soul Surfer,Bought this movie for my little grand daughter. We all watch it together and love the movie.It was used and it was in excellent condition. I thank you again for being the great company that you are.
5,GREAT GREAT GREAT MOVIE!!!!,"This is a very uplifing Christian film, showing the struggle that Bethany Hamilton encountered and overcame as a result of her strong Faith in God. Buy this movie today, it is AMAZING!!"
5,We love Little People books!,"My son (age 2) has been enjoying Little People books since he was around 10 months old. I can't tell you how many times we have read these books! He will happily entertain himself as well and ""read"" the books on his own. We love Little People!"
1,Looks good but poor quality,"These darts look great, but flights are very poor quality. They fall of the shafts and then do not go back on. One of the shafts broke within the first few throws of the dart. Not very useful if they do not work."
3,The Great Bank Robbery... is Great..,"...While no one would confuse this film with Othello... critics in 1969 missed the point. While largely lightweight and at times uneven... it is a hoot!...Fans of Clint Walker will see this as one of his greatest roles... sending up his laconic ""Cheyenne Bodie"" character. SPOILER ALERT! When Kim Novak kisses him and asks him if he likes it he says... in his best laconinc fashion; ""Just because I talk slow don't mean I'm peculiar...""...Zero Mostel is at his best... pious behavior covering larceny. Kim Novak is sort of a charming oversexed flower child. And Claude Akins steals his scenes as an outlaw with violence ""issues...""..."
3,Surprisingly Good!,"When I heard Jean Claude Van Damme made another movie, I was Excited! Then I saw the Trailer and thought this might be a rip-off of Taken. Still had to get this movie and give it a try. It was actually a good movie. There is not as much Martial Arts action, but a lot of Shoot 'em Up and blow stuff up! Solid performance from JCVD and I was entertained! If you are a JCVD fan check it out, it is a good movie."
3,6 Bullets,This movie was decent. I've never been a fan of Jean Claude Van Damme. But he gives a believable perfomance I'm this action movie and if you are a fan of Joe Flanigan of Stargate Alantis you will definitely enjoy this movie.
1,Movie for local market,"Why Moldovia doesn`t produce action movies? The right answer is ""I do not know, but if they are not, then we will do it for them"". And they did. Jean-Claude Van Damme is popular in East, let`s do the business. It looks like a bad US movies back in 1980. Unfortunately, the girls in the movie so ugly, that you would not enjoy even this part too. But I like the business idea - American Movies for Local Markets."
1,Do not buy this,This stopped working after 3 weeks and I requested to return it and get a refund. NOPE! I could only exchange it I was told. I don't need another piece of junk. I want my money back and was told. NO.
1,This is not the Jockers Edition!,This reprint is a non-royalty paying scan from foreign lands. It does NOT have the Jockers introduction (the other 5-star review is not about this edition) and is not a good buy. The 5-star review is about the edition currently only offered on KINDLE.
1,I found it very boring.,"I have read several of Craig Thomas's books, it is hard to believe that he could have written this book.It seemed as if Lock's sister, was more than just a sister.Mostly it was boring, especially the last part of the book."
2,A Snoozer,"I was so puzzled with Craig Thomas' ""A Wild Justice,"" after getting halfway through it, that I wanted to check Amazon.com to see what others said about it. Having worked in post-Soviet Russia for six years, I'd say Thomas portrays a depressing reality with accuracy. But the book is a snoozer. It's predictable and it jumps around. Maybe the Washington Post Book World thinks ""Thomas writes far better than Ludlam."" I don't."
2,A bunch of hype with no substance,"The positive reviews of this work are written by those who worship this guy, not by serious remote viewers. Being the first remote viewer does not make you the best, nor the final word on anything about remote viewing. This book is just another historical perspective by one of the former members of a defunct and disfunstional intelligence unit. It doesn't teach you how to remote view, it doesn't even begin to do this. What it does do, is force the reader to wallow through what was in remote viewing. I'd personally look for a book about what the future may hold, or better yet, how to do it. I would not recommend this book to anyone, unless you simply want to listen to another exmilitary dude blow his horn for you."
2,...ummmm. Not so hot.,"I do believe this man knows what he's talking about but if you're looking for a manual on practical application of Remote Viewing, don't start here.He rights with a slightly arrogant overtone but does explain some fundamental elements of remote viewing. It's OK, but it's a handbook; Nothing more.And certainly not worthy of some of its former reveiws in my opinion."
1,Disappointing,"I am wondering what book the people who gave this 5 star were reading. I don't think it could have been this because it doesn't even reveal any remote viewing ""secrets."" How can it be a good book if the content doesn't live up to the title?"
3,Surprise ending is so sad...,"This book is divided into 2 parts. Part 1, Emmeline's life at the mill earning money to save her family. This section of the book was interesting and gripping. The lonely Emmeline, thrust into the strange world of the mill, reaches for comfort and ends up banished.Part 2, Emmeline's return to her family. This part of the book was depressing and sad. Emmeline returns home but her family has grown up and away from her. She never feels comfortable sharing her experiences at the mill. Her mother has turned inward and her father isn't a warm person. When she finally finds love, it is only for a brief time. Emmeline's world is shredded by a shocking twist that forever isolates her from human contact. A major bummer of an ending!"
5,Thus the Tale Concludes...,"The heros, for the most part, have or are pretty close to finishing their orders given by the shade of Allanon, the last druid. But now comes the hard part, figuring out how they are going to triumph with everything they have accomplished. Rimmer Dall, the head of the greatest evil- Shadowen knows this and strives to make one last plan to not onlt keep the heros apart from each other but to destroy each of them.The epic quest struggles to overcome the obstacles laid oput before them. And hard leassons are learned once again. The heros once no more then children or childish or now men and women- responsible and mature. But their character stays with them, not left behind like so many other books do. This book is packed with excitement, advanture, and danger- a book that if you don't read won't be the publisher's lost but your own lost."
4,Great sum of the prevoius books,"Length:: 0:57 MinsI was glad to see the final outcome and what was really attacking and killing the earth. It was a surprise ending. The development of the characters is almost predictable, but at the same time interesting and compelling. Great final story in this series"
2,STICKY WICKET,"On this 1969 recording, travelling jazzman Dexter Gordon is surrounded by an all-Dutch rhythm section made up of Cees Slinger (piano), Jacques Schols (bass) and Han Bennink (drums). This album was recorded live at the Amsterdam Paradiso, which used to be a church ! The sound is a bit rough, about what you might expect from a decent bootleg, so it's a bit rough around the edges at times, but then, so was Gordon's blowing ! Versions of standards like ""Willow weep for me"" and ""Scrapple from the apple"" (all rather lengthy, as was the Gordon way of doing things live) are coupled with originals like ""Sticky wicket"" (here titled ""Junior"") and ""Fried bananas"", which would be recorded for Prestige some time later in the same year, and which remained favorite blowing vehicles for Gordon for the remainder of his career. Die-hard fans will enjoy this CD, but the casual listener had better look elsewhere for the best in Dexter Gordon."
5,V. Interesting !,"I really liked this documentary... I certainly don't identify with some of the famous names that were interviewed in this but I thought the film makers did a great jobs putting together a well-structured outline of the salient points: how taxes evolved and why, why they're now unmanageable, the possible alternative strategies proposed by various people/groups (fair vs. flat vs. etc)... Highly recommend !"
5,Pay attention!,"As one of the speakers says, ""Pay attention!...if Americans as a whole want to prevent people from making out like bandits, if they want a tax system that treats them fairly and for the good of the country as a whole - you can't avoid it, and you can't just complain about it.""I guarantee you that this DVD, which explains the tax system from its very beginnings and show us how it went so wrong, and what needs to change, will make an impact on you. The video also is extremely well done, with an appropriate balance of serious discussion, clever animations and graphics, and historical footage. It is a fabulous and crucial film. Please not only get it - have home viewings for everyone you know!""If the taxpayers demanded it, the politicians and the political leaders would respond and we could get a dramatically better tax system for everybody."" This is a non-partisan video, and it is something we all need to ""Pay attention"", to."
3,Nice tiles but didn't have a case.,"This is a nice set of tiles and the die, etc, but it came in a cardboard box, not a case of any kind. Not a big deal, but it was advertised as having a vinyl case...good for the price, though."
1,DISGUSTING and DESPICABLE,"I didn't want to rate this book at all I just wanted to send my sympathies to the author and all the (5-star) reviewers who think this book is humorous. I have a great sense of humor, but I find NOTHING funny about suicide, and I'm sorry that you all do. Cartoon bunnies doing it doesn't change the concept. Making fun of, encouraging, and promoting any kind of suicide is WRONG!! I feel sorry for the authors young son (who is now following in his footsteps) and all the reviewers who have children. What would you do if YOUR child committed suicide? I know you wouldn't be laughing about it, unless of course you read enough of andy riley's garbage and become one of the many sick twisted people in the world."
2,Don't waste your time,I found it very hard to watch and took the disk out after 20 minutes. The lighting in the movie was very poor and it was hard to see what was going on. Since it wasn't that much money I did not waste my time and more money returning it. If you want to get a movie don't bother with this one unless you like sitting too close to the tv.
1,Maestro of this CD certainly did not love the movie!,"I loved this movie and was eager to buy the soundtrack. Checked it out in a store--particularly looking for Kelly's ""Someone"", Dreyfuss singing ""Boy"", and my favorite, ""Stranger on the Shore""--which was heart of the movie where the young clarinetist couldn't hit the notes, but was supported/strengthened by Holland, and later becomes the governor of the state. So sad that this could have been a great, cherished CD."
4,BEAUTIFUL,"THIS CD IS AWESOME..... AS IS THE MOVIE.... MOST OF THE SONGS WERE PLAYED ON THE MOVIE, AND TIE IN TO THE MOVIE WELL........... THIS MOVIE/SOUNDTRACK TOUCHES THE HEART...."
5,I Should Have Been There,"This DVD has a CD to it that not every KISS fan, but every rock fan should listen to at least once. I really never expected the acoustic KISS to be good but it really is. It is much more calm, and much more mature sounding. They didn't play any of the hard core songs like Strutter, but the songs they did play went great with the acoustic sound. Another thing I was surprised about was that Ace showed up! I was worried that he would have skipped out on this because of past relations with the band. The concert went great. The fans were cheering by the time it got to Rock N Roll All Nite, which also was a good acoustic version. So if you are interested, or already listening to KISS, you should definitely get this DVD or CD."
2,Review of Uniden 5.8 Phone,"Uniden Dxi5686-2 5.8 Ghz Dual Handset Extended Range Cordless Phone System With Call Waiting Caller IdThis phone is set up so that when you put it to your ear, your cheek hits the off button on the phone. The phone also has a very short range for a 5.8 ghz unit, I have 6 other 5.8 ghz phones and they work all over my yard. These 2 phones only have a range of less than 50 feet. If I had known this I would not have bought them, as they are almost useless when you step outside the door."
4,Cheerleader Ninjas,"This movie killed me. It was so cheesey, it was great! If you are looking for a stupid good time this movie is a good choice."
4,Acceptable Basketball Shoe.,"The only reason I don't give the 5 stars to this shoe is because the rubber tip sort of hurts your big toe. No matter how I laced them, tight or loosen, it was hurtful, up to point I had to stop using them."
1,I can write better than this,"The story line is incredibly weak. Bouncing back and forth from goofy to just plain dumb, I couldn't even finish the entire thing. The audiobook is worse. They used a male and female reader, which had great potential, but they recorded them separately and did a poor job splicing them together. Don't read this at mealtime; you'll end up with indigestion."
2,slow,They should have grouped all 4 C.D.'s together and made shipping cheaper. And they did take a long time to deliver. Never have I seen anything take weeks to get to me.
1,Watch out for counterfeit Shure 57 Microphones!,"I just recently bought two 57's from two different Amazon dealers at a very cheap price of $70. After testing these microphones with other Shure 57's and having a couple of expert local sound technicians spec-out the microphones, we discovered that these microphones were total counterfeits. True Shure microphones are typically very high quality microphones when they are direct from the Shure factory. If you go for the deal, check your microphone as soon as it arrives. If there are problems with your high-end being very sensitive and feeding-back and you have no low-end, it's probably a counterfeit. Shure 57's are pretty well balanced across the board with very little adjustments on your EQ.Go ahead, pay a higher price and buy them from your local music dealer or from an Internet store that you trust. There are counterfeits out there...be careful!!!I normally rate genuine Shure 57 Microphones as 5-stars."
4,The old stand by,I use this to mic snare drums and sometimes guitar cabinets. It works as well as most mics and is more durable than most. I have used this in the studio when nothing else was available and it worked fine. As long as I run sound for a living I will keep some of these mics.
3,Dr. Who - The Beginning Collection,"This was a gift purchase.The recipients were very pleased with the gift, but I personally have not watched the DVDs."
3,Haven't gotten it.,I ordered this being the Mega Whovian I am in November. I have not gotten it yet. It hasn't even shipped yet! The only reason I even gave it 3 stars is because it is Doctor Who and to rate it anything lower would be lying because nothing Doctor Who can be bad. I am wondering if I will ever receive the videos.
5,Excellent Wraps for Heavy Lifting,"As a gym rat who has had several bicycling and weightlifting related injuries, I need additional wrist support when lifting heavier weight while benching, incline benching and curling. These wraps are an excellent complement to my Harbinger gloves for such heavy lifts. Compared to other heavy-duty wrist wraps, these are more elastic, longer and slightly thinner. This results in less bulk and tighter constriction of the blood flood to the wrists. So, between lifts, I find that I need to remove the wraps each time. However, the lower bulk makes generally makes the hassle tolerable. Is short, if you like a more flexible wrap for heavy lifting, the Harbinger Pro-Thumb loop wrist wraps are a good choice."
2,"Good support, but ripped first time I used them","They must be making these cheaper than they used to. My current pair has lasted 5 years but were starting to get really grungy. Decided to get another pair. Used these for a heavy chest workout and the support they provided was fine. When I undid the strap though, one of the velco fasteners ripped right off so now it's unusable."
4,Shown last night at Florida State University................,"The delightful story of love lost, alienation from lost loves, strangers meet, begin to get to know each other, begin to desire each other, and then begin to love each other [the rest told would spoil the film].......The film is definitely in the classic style of the French film directors.I recommend viewing the film."
1,Completely different from the decription,"This is a kind of fraud from the seller, to present completely different photo of the item and send you a tiny little tape! When I claimed it they said that was a zoom picture! Not acceptable at all!Dont trust this seller!"
3,Product as advertised. Books not discreet.,"I noticed other reviewers mentioning the book titles were not boring enough. They were right. While this product does live up to what is advertised, the books I received were far too interesting for what should be a diversion safe. The two books I got where a book about Willie Mays, and a book written by Karl Rove. Either of these books would appeal to the average sports fan or political junkie. I'd much rather get books that are completely random novels or something that nobody would want to pick up."
5,Exactly as advertised,Great price and gets the job done. People mentioned difficulty of snapping inside band on: Mine came ready to wear!
4,The Stone Arrow,This book is set in very early English history and is a fictional story. It is well written and while reading it one is very inclined to forget that it is fiction. The presentation is of such a standard that it seems to be utterly true. The conflict between different cultures is brought out very clearly and loyalty and treachery at all levels are dealt with grippingly.
5,Couldn't put it down,"Great book! Anyone who likes the Earth's Children series by Jean M. Auel will like this as well. A very exciting and suspenseful read, as well as a great insight into nomad life."
5,perfect work,at last i got you baby. this is one cd album any jazz guiter loving fan should not afford to miss- period. is a matter of take it or leave it as others are willing to take it. keep the good work Norman.
5,An absolutely ultimate study aid assistant!!,"I'd purchased this item before through another online website and paid much more for it. I ordered a new one for one of my children. This is a wonderful study aid, and I know it will be useful as a study guide. I cannot wait until the old testament version is released. Hopefully, a movie version will also be considered sometime in the near future."
2,DIsappointing at best,"I have not even been able to finish listening to this. It has no chapter/book divisions, and W-A-Y too much background noise (special effects?) I am disappointed."
5,The Bible,I bourght one for my secretary and was so impressed that I purchase a second one for myself. It really brings the bible to another level of understanding and it is read by well known Black Folks. I love it.
5,INSPIRATIONAL,"What a way for the Word of God to come alive. With the background voices (when Jesus feeds the 5000), sound effects (like the waves when Jesus walks on water), I feel like I am there and Jesus is talking to me. I think this is what the Gospel writers intended - verbally sharing the Word for it is much more powerful than reading it.This will be a Christmas present."
5,Inspired By The Bible Experience: New Testament,So moving. I am so excited about The Bible Experience. I think everyone should have it.
2,"Great idea, but...","After reading many positive reviews for this product, I felt sure that it would be a good purchase. I've listened to the whole New Testament now and I have to say that I am disappointed with this volume's interpretation. I love the idea of actors portraying the Bible to make it more accessible, but I guess the downside of having actors portray it is that they will interpret it in their own way. I found the person portraying Jesus to come across as overly preachy and at times even mean-spirited, and Paul talked too fast for me to believe in his character--he spoke so fast throughout the CDs that he sounded overly scripted."
5,MUST BUY!!!,"This is my first ""audio book"" and what an inspiring purchase. I've always only read bits and pieces of the Bible, but with this I have committed myself to read along as I listen. Thank you for this blessing."
3,They didnt turn over what i expected :(,"I loved there cover version of ""come on feel the noise"" and when i heard there great hit ""metal health (bang your head)"" I had to check out there greatest hits... I was a bit disapointed, apart from maybe a collection of under half the album, I found that what i knew in the first place was what i liked and the rest didnt appeal to me! ""Slick Black Cadilac"" and ""mamma were all crazy now"" where about the only ones I found to be new to me for the first time that i liked after a while, and the live track of ""bang your head (metal Health) sounds very good! but the lack of what felt like filler songs to me brang its rating down for me! And if it feels like fillers on a GH album!? well.... need i say it? there not much more then what i mentioned i liked about this album!"
4,Same title/Wrong book - Where can I find THIS book?,"I am responding to the initial 5 star review above because this reviewer is clearly referring to a different novel also entitled Deer Hunter....but it's not the book that was written following the Vietnam themed film. Where, oh where can I find the novel referred to in the above review? It sounds like an amazing read and has in fact been mentioned to me before, but nobody can remember the author's name and the only results for Deer Hunter on the web are related to the Michael Cimino film. If this reviewer could respond, I would really appreciate it. I've been trying to locate this book for quite some time now..."
1,dangerous,"To begin the hooks are awful, they feel awkward and easily slip off the bar, then the material holding the hooks in place ripped which left me with no hook at all rendering them entirely useless. I had them for no longer than one month dont waste your money"
1,Better to use nothing at all....,"This product is not what it seems to be! I'm referring to the fact that these lifting hooks do not support the weight for very long. Once strapped and weight is in hand, the user is able to do a few reps of whatever exercise until the bar starts to slip from your hands as well as the hooks.I'm my opinion, the overall comfort is great. But the usefulness is almost none existent."
5,Perfect for 2001 Suzuki Vitara,"I bought this wiper blade to replace the rear wiper blade on my 2001 Suzuki Vitara. It fits perfectly and works well. It was rather surprising to see just how worn down and out of shape my old blade was. Unfortunately, replacing the blade was a pain in the ""you-know-what"" since the tail-gate mounted spare tire needed to be removed to change the blades, but that's not the fault of this wiper blade. 5 stars!"
4,They work.,I put them on my '09 Jeep Wrangler. Easy to install and appear to work pretty well in heavy and light rain; no complaints. We'll see how they handle mud and snow soon enough.
2,not that great,After being blown away by Culture Club's albums Color By Numbers I was really disappointed by the fact that most of the songs on Kissing To Be Clever are so much sounding alike. i would not reccomend this album at all.
2,SNAIL PACED YAWNER,"Phil Rickman is known for his long, heavily plotted novels and this one is no exception. While one must admit to Rickman's skills in developing characters and offering multi-layered plots, I found this thriller to be less than thrilling and way too long to sustain interest. I had to force myself to finish it as Rickman did manage to at least pique my interest. Set in a small English village, the plot focuses on a female minister and her rather annoying daughter and some kind of mysticism surrounding a former minister who supposedly committed suicide centuries before. An attempt to stage a play revolving around this suicide brings out the demons in the small town. There are so many characters and such rambling passages that WINE OF ANGELS ends up tedious, repetitive and by the time the mystery is solved, one forgets who the characters are. Shaving off a couple of hundred pages may have made this a good read; I do not, however, recommend it unless you have patience and perseverance."
3,"Good, but not great","I'm not certain why some feel the longer the book, the better the book. The story could have been tighter, but there were many strong points. The atmospheric details contribute strongly to the suspense and tension. Merrily and Jane are excellent characters with a realistic relationship that grows and develops with the story. There are interesting secondary characters who contribute strongly to the plot. Unfortunately there were times when the story seemed to lose its way and become rather plodding. I liked that the suspense didn't rely on clichés, but it was not all it could have been either. Still, there was enough to make me hope and read another in this series."
2,bad idea for the most part.,"they're so much better off not trying to play other people's songs. the album isn't heinous, but i'd rather them lay off trying to play the stooges or the reigning sound. ""we repel each other"" is a watered down version of greg oblivian's genius. the album's not entirely horrible - i actually like ""gimme"", for what it's worth. but if you're looking for good covers of terrific songs, this ain't it. she's got a nice voice, just needs to used energetically and not wasted on songs poorly redone."
3,Okay,The software didn't seem to work with my MAC and the colors and screen was very skewed even after tweaking the resolutions. I am hoping the software will work better in my classroom on the computers there.
2,more like going to church than dinner,Not impressed ! Just a collection of nice classical movements much of which I have in complete form. I would rather eat dinner with something a bit more spirited that would let me know I'm dining rather than in a church or an auditorium for classical music.
5,Fun,Originally received one of these as a gift. Now as they wear out I always get another one. Not always available in stores.
1,Horrible,Listen to the reviews! I wish i did. This is horrible. Thermometer does not work which makes the purchase useless.
3,"Old book, basic information",If you are curious about polymer and want in depth reading then you will enjoy this book. I like projects and applications. I have read parts of this book but it didn't tell me what I didn't all ready know or didn't much care about.
5,VERY ENJOYABLE....,"Although five films are crammed onto one disc (again), the prints of these old films are watchable and, in some cases, good. My five stars are for the first three, ""Murders in the Rue Morgue"", ""The Black Cat"" and ""The Raven"". These are classics and in pretty good shape. The last two, ""The Invisible Ray"" and ""Black Friday"" didn't fair as well print wise. However, ""Ray"" looks better than ""Friday"". But just to have the first three on DVD is worth the buy. ""Murders"" (1932) is still a grisly rendering of the Poe tale with Lugosi in top form as the mad Dr.Mirakle experimenting with gorilla blood in (female) humans. ""Cat"" and ""Raven"" have the wonderful teamings of Lugosi and Karloff pitted against each other in gruesome plots of Poe inspired revenge. All three of these films feature some great sets to marvel over too. For collectors of classic horror films, this is a great set. For Karloff and Lugosi fans, it's a must. Enjoy."
3,"Great Horror Films with""NO"" extras/ playback issues","This is an nice collection of Bela Lugosi Films.Unlike the earlier releases by Univeral such as ""Dracula The Legacy Collection"" it lacks commentary,trailers, production notes or even Cast Bio's.NOTE: ""DISC"" appears to have a problem in Playback. Noted several instances of frame skipping and artifacts in at least two titles. With the worst problems appearing ""THE BLACK CAT"" which locks up at the Black Mass climax."
3,Great date film!,"Totally entertaining film. ""Cute"" story! ""Cute"" situations! Funny lines! CUTE actors! Not a ""classic,"" but a worthwhile view."
5,"Learn by DVD: Golf by Step By Step, Saul Nir","I recommend this CD for anyone who want to learn to play golf, or brush up on their golf game techniques. Step by Step instructions."
3,The very short book for beginners,"I think this book is not really worth the money. However, if you are only interested in the basics and don't plan on buying any other books on this subject, it's worth it. The information in this book is something most people know already and I think I was mislead. This book seems to be too general about the art of shooting. But I still think that this book has a lot of value to beginners."
3,one quote is worth the price,"""As we enter the 21st century we find that rifle marksmanship has been largely lost in the military establishments of the world. The notion that technology can supplant incompetence is upon us in all sorts of endeavors, including that of shooting.""A gun nerd friend of mine told me I had to read the book. I don't have any guns and I don't shoot so I frankly didn't find the information very useful. On the other hand, you have to admire this guy's fanaticism taking his granddaughters to Africa to blast away at Zebras. If he were a programmer, he'd be using Common Lisp.Anyway, I found the book valuable because of the above quote. People who run Web projects and think they can make up for their unwillingness to hire competent programmers by buying junkware/middleware need to read this."
1,JUNK!,"I will have you know, a new steering wheel for my tan RSX was incredibly hard to find and also very expensive. I really wanted wheelskins to work!! I bought the color I thought was correct and the size I thought was correct and took my time to install the cover carefully.The color did not match.The cover did not fit over the bolstered sides of the wheel.The stitching was frayed by the time I was done sewing it together.It did not last and broke through easily with minimal wear.I have now given up in every way shape and form on these skins or any wrap. I spent the 200 dollars to get a new wheel and was much much happier with OEM quality, durability and looks."
4,A sexy occult tale,"I liked this one very much. I felt it was well-written, with humor as well as sex. The hero and herione were a great pairing and I hope they return in a sequel. The book gets off to a flying start with the sexy villainess - the Contessa - condemning a man to the debauched cravings of a dungeon-full of sex-starved female prisoners. After that, the race is on, as the blurb puts it, 'to prevent the ushering in of a slave society over which the Contessa and her debauched acolytes will reign supreme'. It's a fun read, tho maybe the ending is just a bit contrived, which is why I only give it 4 stars, not 5. But very close!"
4,Telefon transfer is an embarassment!!!,"I have a copy of Telefon in widescreen taped from TV that was a much better transfer than this. The DVD picture is so soft on this new release that it appears to almost be out of focus altogether a great deal of the film. A great disappointment that they felt Telefon needed to be released as a two-fer with another title that was already out, and then released with some generic cover. What was wrong with the great theatrical artwork?!?!Sure you can say ""At least it got a release"" but this scares me for the remaining Bronson DVD releases that have not yet arrived - Stone Killer, White Buffalo, Machine Gun Kelly, and From Noon til Three.Maybe Region 2 will do it some justice. If you do buy this release, get it on the cheap and lower your expectations...."
4,Bronson Collection,"I had been looking for the movie Telefon on DVD for some time. I saw other reviews indicating the picture quality wasn't very good, but I found the quality to be acceptable. The film is an older one and I didn't expect it to match the newer digital DVD pictures. It is clear, and the same quality as the picture when shown on one of the classic movie channels - but without the commercials."
4,"What a plesant suprise this film is, truly a joy to watch....","I've seen reviews on this film, and decided to give it a try. I was pleasantly surprised much I liked this film, the storyline being so unusual, the beautiful sceneries, the unusual love story, and all the actors performances were great!It was a pleasure watching this film!I did recommend this film to all my friends, and my end statement is that it was time well spent!"
1,AWFUL,"Wow. This movie was terrible. How it got several recommendations is beyond my scope of understanding. I would rather pull my toe nails out with pliers than watch this again. Yes, I really didn't like it."
1,silly,"I think this film is silly. The writer (it was apparently based on a book) has no insights to convey about love, Arabs, Yemeni society, fishing, life in a British government, or anything I'm aware of.Nevertheless, the project was green-lighted all the way through!"
4,You have to like it...,"Okay, not my normal sort of movie, but my wife insisted on watching it. It is typical British humor, dry at times. The movie does sometimes try a little too hard to be sentimental. the leading characters have great chemistry though, making up for some of the gaps. Seems that they may have cut a little deep along the edit lines, so things just sort of happen. Be interesting to see if there is an unedited version.I give it a 3.5, but 4 is close enough. B if you need a letter grade."
3,"Good acting, OK story","I'm a huge Ewan McGregor fan and his performance did not disappoint. Emily Blunt also added depth to a character I probably would have hated had it been any other actress. But, the story could have pushed farther and ended up being too quaint."
2,Cute but unbelievable,"This is nothing like Slum Dog Millionaire, and that's a disappointment from the first scene to the last. Even though it is intended to be a much more intimate and nuanced movie, it never stirs the viewer's emotions enough to achieve ""suspension of disbelief"" since it is so utterly unbelievable. That is a shame for the cast, who try mightily to reach the audience. But, this movie fails with terminal cuteness. I don't think that even a thirteen year old could find its silliness engaging. Sometimes you can just try too hard."
5,Don't let the title fool you.,This was a great movie and totally unexpected pleasure. The subject matter was interesting and the actors were great to watch.
4,brilliant - loved every minute,Very entertaining.. great story. Ewan McGregor is phenomenal .. all the acting was top notch. highly recommend it - very romantic and funny too!!
4,Good light comedy,Good story line and characters. Not for action movie buffs. Lots of dialogue and character interplay. Understated British humor. My wife & I liked it.
4,"Muslims... and fly fishing, yeah right!","Muslims... and fly fishing, yeah right! Muslims do not enjoy the finer things in life unless they were exposed the western society and learn to appreciate our lifestyle. Good love story though."
4,dramatic and interesting,"We thought this movie was a comedy but alas it was far from it. However, it held our attention. I liked the underlying message of patience and faith along with the idea of new beginnings."
5,Better than I thought it would be,Loved this movie. Very interesting. Good love story. Great scenery. Really enjoyed every moment of it. Now I want to read the book!
5,Very well made movie with an unusual angle,"This is a BBC production and has a standard that one has come to expect of the BBC. Very enjoyable movie, with excellent acting and nicely sequenced events that make a far fetched plot come to life in a delightful way. Contemporary. Would strongly recommend."
4,Almost as Good as the Book,I had previously read the book and really enjoyed it. The actors in the movie were great and the story was pretty close to the book. Not really sure whether I liked the way the book turned out as compared to the movie. I guess it will be a personal preference.
1,Sucks:,"Bought the HP 9800 for 13X19 Prints. The printer printed two outstanding prints and after that it would only print a half page of totally black ink. I have spent more money on professional technicians who can't figure out what is wrong with the printer. At this time the printer is unusable even thro I bought a three year warranty. In talking with the folks who sold me the printer, they said under the warranty HP should replace or give me a newer model, however that is not how it works. In short the warranty was a waste of money and time. The company should be more responsible for their products. It is the same old problem that HP has had with printers, and they know that and they putting out products with the same results. I will not buy another HP product."
1,Psycho (cue violins!) Printer,"Having used this printer for 3 years:Gulps ink! -- the tanks are WAY too small, esp. the color. And those tanks are VERY expensive for their size.Chews paper! -- watch the beasty closely or it will jam, try to send 4 or more sheet through at once, etc.Doesn't know if it has ink or not -- that light just stays on.Cancel button is worthless. Cancel = unplug!Set up to do the fancier things it is supposed to do is a challenge worthy a rocket scientist.Drivers are problematic -- you think you have it set correctly in the application, but the printer then goes its own psycho way and messes it up -- this is especially true with the paper orientation choice.Don't buy -- look elsewhere"
2,DO NOT BUY THIS PRINTER! HP does not have working drivers for it!,"The printer will not print. HP provides a printer diagnostic utility that is useless. Their customer support is no help, as they will only tell you to do the obvious like ""make sure the USB cable is plugged in"".DUH!The Windows XP drivers for this printer do not work. The only work around is to use drivers for an HP Deskjet 9600.I have asked HP to provide WORKING Windows XP drivers for the Deskjet 9800, but they do not even bother to reply.Shows how much they care about their customers. Not at all.Do not buy this product. You will wind up with a large and expensive paperweight."
4,Great for 11x17 Preliminary reviews,"If you need something inexpensive like I did to show clients your preliminary sketches....then this is the printer to go with. It gives you clean black lines for your drawings..and for a Preliminary plan, that's all one needs. Instead of having to waste your 24x36 Plotter paper, this is the way to go.Changing the paper sizes can be a little cumbersome...but hey for the price, it works...:-)"
5,Great Pedals - Period,"I've been using these M647 pedals for about 8 years. Same pedals, even outlasted the last full suspension mountain bike that I had. I haven't needed to do any maintenance during that time, but the ability to take the pedals apart and grease/tighten is there if needed. Don't confuse these with the cheaper Shimano M424 pedals (I went through a pair of those in less than one year - they do not wear as well and can not be disassembled for maintenance). I'm buying replacements because mine are staring to wear out a bit (not bad after years of regular off-road riding) but they are still functional. If you want something that will provide a good clipless connection, plenty of support when you are not clipped in (or wearing regular shoes), with good quality and durability, these are the pedals you want."
5,Great pedal,Great product at a great price. Install was easy with a pedal spanner. Good size platform can be used without SPD shoes when biking on a casual ride. Can also give you confidence when entering questionable terrain. I researched several pedal options and am very happy with this choice.
4,"A good read, but not her best.","As usual, Winterson provides dreamlike, well-written, creative stories. This is not her best work, but still worth reading if you are a fan."
1,the world and other places,"I thought this book was awful in every way. Extremely pretentious writing style, full of stilted and forced ""concepts"" and contrived points-of-view to display to the reader the author's self-image as incredibly witty, literary and superior. In short, it has all the hallmarks of a novice. I feel guilty writing such a negative review, because I really enjoyed one of her other books, ""The Passion"". Now I realize that her artificial voice, heavy-handed attempts at interesting word juxtapositions, and phony contrivances work better when she is describing a fantasy setting in which she obviously must invent a character and its imaginary inner life. I would not give this book away to anyone, much less recommend people spend money on it."
1,No substance,"A very outdated book. Not very good even when it was relevant. There's just no substance and the ideas that are touched on are not followed through.Just enough material to be really dangerous for a novice. Please don't even read the chapter on trading thinly-traded, non-liquid issues. Don't even go there and get that idea out of your head permanently. ""The art of going broke.""I really, really doubt that this guy is still trading, or if he is, that his lifetime trades show a net profit. I'd make a substantial bet against that.If you are a newbie, get Toni Turner's daytrading book instead.[...]"
3,It's what you'd expect from a sophmore album,"I think Bloc Party is incredible. There are some great moody songs on this album, but a few drive me a little crazy. Overall it's a good album, but if you don't have any Bloc Party albums, get Silent Alarm first."
3,More examples needed,"I find the contents of this book is academic and well researched.I also liked the guiding spirit of the volume, that is celebrating female genitals.However, I found the page that described the 4 arch types of Yonis according to Ayur veda a little bit like bogus.You need more actual examples and more detailed comments."
4,Very good movie but no so much about lesbian relationship,"This movie was good, however I don't even think it showed her and her girlfriend kissing. Its not realy about a gay relationship it is about the main character coming out to her family. She has a midget sister, and she has to come out to her family before a man walks on the moon. So its really about her crazy family, and her mom accepting her. Her girlfriend is barley in the movie either. I would recomend it, but not as a romance movie, so dont expect any lesbian action."
2,to watery,"I opened one and liquid gushed out. I buy thinly sliced smoked salmon from my local deli, the difference is that liquid from this is the dense salmon oil( the superior fat oil).as far as comparing taste and texture, seabear had a nice smoky flavor this was the only thing positive for me. Hands down my locally purchased salmon is way better, and it costs much less. This isn't about cost if I was offered seabear salmon at 75% off, I would pass. I'll never order this again I am very disappointed."
4,where's 2002?,"This is a very nice piece of music but only half of the project! If you can get your hands on 2002 the second cd of ""fairytales"", you will see how greatly j&s have influenced our music since their inception. Stella is undoubtedly the godfather of all trance. the version here is a shorter one than the complete stella (10:24) however, it fits nicely into 2001. All in all, this is definitely a journey worth taking. It flows nicely from one song to the next and somehow manages NOT to sound like 1993. Again, if you can find 2002, there are some gems on this one as well. The four stars refers to the complete 2001/2002."
2,Very uncomfortable!,"I like the way they look. They went on easily by using zip ties. However, after riding once for about 15 minutes, they became very uncomfortable. The grip is horrible and hard on your hands. In order to get my original grips off my bike, I had to cut them and I wish I would have kept them instead."
5,Awesome grips!,"These grips are awesome! They are way better than any bike's grips I have used before, great shock absorption and great grip when dry or sweaty!"
1,Hammer Horror Indeed,This is for the set not the movies universal quit making boxsets you apparently don't know what you are doing PHANTOM OF THE OPERAand EVIL OF FRANKENSTEIN skip and freeze on PHANTOM towards the end of the movie is when it starts. In EVIL it goes through the whole movie almost also CURSE OF THE WEREWOLF does it too BRIDES OF DRACULA works just fine i knew this was toooo good to be true i was really looking forward to this set for months you would think that since these were professionally made there would be no problem what a waste congratulations on people who have perfect copies that all movies play great I just don't know what to do
1,Defective Discs,"While I enjoyed the movies in this set that I was able to access, I had to return it because neither Evil of Frankenstein nor Curse of the Werewolf would play properly. I should have been advised by the warnings of other customers who had similar problems. Live and learn."
1,CD Quality,"I do not recommend purchasing this DVD. It is of very poor quality. Most of the movies in the set will not even play smoothly and a couple of them just freeze and stop. I even had the DVD replaced after my initial order and the second one did pretty much the same thing, even on various dvd players."
3,Hammer Horror Series DVD,"The movies are as I remember them. Entertaining and no gratuitous violence. Don't go looking for great plot development. Some of it is pretty stupid: In ""Brides of Dracula"", what kind of stupid vampire would leave his worst enemy alive albeit slightly bitten and go fetch the pretty heroine so that he could bite her in front of his enemy instead of taking her just about any time he could have enroute back.My only real complaint is that ""curse of the werewolf"" froze up right at the climactic end and no amount of wiping and cleaning could fix it."
2,hammerseries,save your cash.this is a letdown collection.don't misunderstand:that's not to say that hammer studios failed to live up to their usual great standards concerning the horror movie genre;it's the powers-that- be that determine which movies go into a particular collection.no studio makes great movies with every attempt;hammer's no exception to this rule.there's really only one good movie in this collection(evil of frankenstein):brides of dracula is also passable.everything else...junk.
2,8 MOVIES ON 2 FLIPPER DISCS,I really don't care for most of these films. I only wish Curse Of The Werewolf and The Evil Of Frankenstein were available on independant single sided dvds. And that's all I have to say about that.
3,Good Reference For The Enthusiast,"For collectors, restorers, or others with an interest in Ford 4x4 trucks, this book is a useful addition to the bookshelf. It gives info on production figures, significant model year changes, and includes plenty of photos, but ALL are black and white. It traces the evolution of the Ford offroad trucks from the mid-30's to 1990, but it doesn't offer any real insight into the performance of these vehicles, either on or off road."
5,Excellent!,"A great comedy that's different to many with the late, great Ronnie Barker in top form and a stellar cast. One to enjoy time and again. Don't miss it!"
2,No Substance,"This book mostly just gives a list of the hormones and what they do, but offers no real solutions outside of talking to you Doctor about hormone replacement therapy. I don't need a book to tell me that. I can find better advice on the net."
3,Prety good,Petty good book. A little simplistic but it has good overall information on what one needs to know about hormones.
3,"""better to be a first rate you than a second rate Frazetta.""","From the moment you open this book you'll see this guy is truly a second rate Frank Frazetta. Everything from his short, wonderfully shaped women to his lush, organic backgrounds to his primate like creature design just screams "" i wanna be Frazetta.""I do however, somewhat agree with one of the other reviews that this book makes for a reasonable figure study. Although I have to say that i find some of his proportions to be a bit off. (particularly with his men)All in all though, it still is worth a look."
1,But . . . but . . . but . . .,But why are the rear ends on his depictions of women so huge?Some even appear to have cellulite on them.
5,A Must Have,"When I first purchased my house, I bought a plethora of home repair books. This stood out as one of the best. It offers all the information you would need for basic plumbing repairs within the house. From the bathtub to the kitchen sink to the toilet, this book covers all sorts of problems that arise in the average household. A great book for the home repair library. Invaluable."
5,Great Book,"Lots of great photos and detailed views, step by step. Techniques and materials were covered pretty well. A very useful book."
2,Tasted Funky,"Halloween seems to be the only time of the year that I can find Charlston Chews at my local grocery store and I got hooked this past year. When they ran out of their supply I found some here on Amazon. When they arrived I ripped open the package and popped one in my mouth and no sooner spit it back out. It not only had a slight cruch to it, but it also had a weird taste. Like it had been stored next to moth balls. My son is also a big fan of this candy bar and he spit it out as well..."
4,Best of Isaac Hayes,This CD of Isaac Hayes is fantastic. I didn't realize when I ordered it that it contained all long versions. I am so glad that I have this now in my collection. Now that Isaac has passed this CD is even more important to have.
4,timeless classic,"If you are a fan of Bob Hope or the performers of this era,this would be a great dvd to own."
5,Great Gift Idea,"I bought this bundle pack for the baby shower of one of my old college roomate's wives. I figured that everyone else would be buying them baby clothes and stuff and I wanted to get something unique. I'm glad I did. My friend was very happy with this nine disk set which is full of helpful advice for new parents and parents of toddlers. He said it was much easier, and more fun to watch these DVDs that it would have been to read several childcare books. Plus, because the disks are broken down into sections, it is easy for them to replay certain pieces of advice later if they face a similar challenge. All in all this makes a great baby shower gift."
3,super man,"i was excited to get this costume for my nephew he's been watching superman everyday for two months so i had to do. he was so excited to see it and put it on right away, and slept with it on the first night. it's a great buy, but it is very thin, that part of the Velcro parts came off easily but not that big of a deal if you know how to sow it back on."
2,Adorable...but poorly made.,"My three year old loves this costume...it really is the cutest I've seen, but he has had it for several hours and already the seams are ripping out, the S is coming off of the front and the fabric is tearing. Day two, had my mother re-sew all the seams, fabric is still terrible but hopefully will last several more outings! Sad because this is a very cute costume."
4,RUB IT BETTER,What a swinging good time this cd is. Great when driving. Upbeat and perfect to toe tap too.
3,Okay,"I was a little disappointed with this movie. I really felt like I was watching one of Channing Tatum's dancing flicks. The acting wasn't that great, but it had its high points. The best part was the club scenes (so the ladies will like that)."
3,Better to rent than buy this one,"This movie has a pretty decent cast, but it's missing something. The story line could have been better; it needed more substance."
4,Great Movie!,It was a pleasure to watch. We streamed it on the wall which made it even better! Definitely recommend this movie.
1,I really wanted to like this movie,"I thought it would be a fun romp, but it was badly made, way too raunchy and profane. I ended up turning it off about 3/4s of the way through."
3,Magic mike sizzles and fizzles!,"Magic Mike has lots of hotness! The story is weak but lets be honest, thats not why we watched it! It wasnt worth $3.99."
2,"Great Bodies, but weak storyline!","Great looking bodies and good dancing, but the story was weak and boring. Actors gave it their best shot...and butts!"
2,Not good at all,My wife convinced me to watch this movie because of good critic reviews. That was a mistake. The story is boring and almost non-existent. The acting is mediocre at best and the writing is atrocious. Avoid at all costs! My wife did not like it either.
4,I See How He Got His Name,"I only had to watch two minutes of Magic Mike before I saw Channing Tatum's butt and Matthew McConaughey shirtless. That right there is enough to make this a must-see for women and gay men. Okay, this is not a great movie. Not even close. For a movie about male stripping, there is probably only about ten or fifteen minutes of actual stripping. There should have more stripping, and less drama about drugs and stuff. But is it worth seeing? Definitely. And Matthew McConaughey might give the most entertaining performance of his career in this movie."
2,Not what I expected,This movie was not nearly as good as all the girls in the world kept going on about. Wouldn't waste your time.
3,magic mike,"you have to remember this is being written and reviewed by me (lisa) mastromonace (wife) this was a disappointment, with all the hype going on the only good scenes were the commercials, and then when you rent the movie it's just ker-plunk, the steamieness isn't their between the main charecters (compared to his other movies), i wouldn't pay for this movie would i watch it again only if it was for free and if i had nothing else to watch.."
3,It was okay,I had higher expectations and the movies plot wasn't all that good. There wasn't much to the plot at all.
3,Disappointed me:(,Sad story line ... Did not expect that from the previews...I really enjoy Matt m. But was disappointed with this one.
5,hot!,"It's Channing Tatum...need i say more??? i seen the movie and i knew i wanted to but it, its just a bit pricy for it being a digital ( on the computer viewable) only- needless to say i re-bought the actual movie on DVD"
2,Magic Mike,"Boring!!!!! This was a real letdown...It had a good premise but ""No Way"" did it fullfill the promise that was eluded to..."
2,Not as good as I thought it would be,I like Channing but in this movie I thought it was a bit tacky not his best film. Colour of the movie was a bit off.
3,Ok movie,"This movie wasn't horrible, and it wasn't great. Granted, it's about male strippers, but from the advertisements, I thought it was going to be more of a comedy. There were a couple of funny scenes, but it just wasn't what I expected. Like I said before, I've seen worse!"
1,What a Waste,Why did I spend my money on renting this movie? The plot was sub par in the least and I felt my brains turning into mush. And hour plus of my life I'm never getting back.
3,Mediocre,It was just an OK movie...nothing more nor nothing less. Certainly not an Academy Award winner. Mindless drivel at best.
1,I loved all of the other Harry Potters but this one didn't cut it,"As an avid Harry Potter fan and an all around lover of any kind of magic tricks, I am deeply disappointed by this sequel. I sat through all 111 minutes of it and not once did I see a single magic trick. It was just a bunch of boys with their shirts off flopping their genitals around. I do this sort of thing every morning before showering for work. If you are looking for magic tricks, this is not the movie you want."
3,Magic Mike,Although reminiscent of my days in the 70s' it was a poor movie. The dancing was good but the story line and acting leaves a lot to be desired.
1,Unwatchable...except maybe with the volume on MUTE,"Seriously? 5 stars? We are not rating a dance scene here but a whole movie...and that whole movie SUCKS. The lead female has to be the worst actor I've ever seen. This movie is just beyond bad. And I'm not hard to please as far as movies go. But, no one will listen. So, go watch it...and then kindly review it. Everyone in this movie needs an acting lesson. McConaughey, too. Things must be TOUGH for him to accepted this role. As for Tatum - the guy can dance...but this is one movie to not be proud of. Of course, it's all about the money, and he made it. So, I guess the last laugh's on him. SAD what the public accepts these days. Even sadder what the industry is passing off as a motion picture."
2,where's all the special features mentioned,WHERE ARE ALL THE SPECIAL FEATURES THAT ARE LISTED FOR THIS DVD??????Special Features- Deleted Dance Scenes- Backstage On Magic Mike- The Moves of Magic MikeONLY GET Special Features- Backstage On Magic MikeNot happy!!!
4,"Bad plot, but hot guys!","If you're watching this movie for its dynamic plot (and chances are, you're not), you'll probably be disappointed. The storyline and acting is so-so at best, and it feels pretty thrown together. However, if you want to see this movie for the more obvious reasons (Channing Tatum plus a slew of other hot male dancers...need I even elaborate?) disappointment is not in the forecast. Their performances were great, and there were some pretty funny moments too. Magic Mike isn't a masterpiece by any means, but I enjoyed it and will watch it again. It's a great girls night movie, and worth buying if you're looking for something lighthearted and full of eye candy!"
3,Dissapointment!,I purchased this movie because I found it for $3 dollars and I thought it would be good but I was very disappointed. Although some parts were interesting overall I would give this movie a 4/10 because of the storyline. t has great actors but the storyline was not well developed and interesting at some points within the movie.
3,"Hot guys, weak plot",I loved this movie for the pure enjoyment of having the shoe be on the other foot and having men being objectified. The chiseled bodies of these men made this movie a guilty pleasure ;). Weak plot was made up with the distraction of beautiful men.
2,Waste of time,"Movie was not very good. I mean, seriously I didn't believe for one moment the female character. She didn't seem to fit. The only reason I watched is Matt Bomer who wasn't in the movie enough for me."
3,Magic Dumb.,"After hearing all the buzz on facebook and stuff about Magic Mike, i decided i would rent it. I paid $4 for this movie for 48 hours. I feel as if i wasted my money. This movie was not as good as i expected it to be. Yes, the men are to die for hot. BUT, i guess i just expected more. The movie was alright, but i will never rent nor buy this movie ever again!"
2,Mostly bump and grind; story really thin,"OK, so all these guys have beautiful bodies and know, more or less, how to move. They take money for their performances and have dreams beyond the week end ""bump and grind."" This movie is a poor excuse for some soft porn with no compelling tension or plot to tie it together. The end is predictable, the middle is too long (where is a good editor when you need one) with the salacious left in long and hard to grab the middle aged over weight lady demographic??? I don't know. Either way, it could not be considered anything but, as other reviewers have indicated, BAD."
3,Not as Expected,Not a full screen movie. Movie was just a run of the mill ...nothing spectacular. My neighbors enjoyed it. Thanks!
3,Tasty Eye Candy But No Plot,"Unfortunately, you have to sit patiently through a bad plot to get to the entertaining dance scenes. But you have to give it to those guys, they can really move!"
1,Such a waste,"I had high hopes for this movie, but was completely disappointed.The dancing scenes are few and far between, and the storyline sucks. If someone offered me this film for free, I would decline.If you are looking for something to watch, keep looking."
3,"It was cute, but not fabulous...","I missed this in the theatre so when I saw it on Amazon, I decided to order it. It was okay. Moderately amusing, but I could've skipped it. Frankly, I don't think Matt McConaghy is that great of an actor, nor is Channing Tatum. Watching them prance around in their skivvies was good fun, but that was about the only thing worth seeing this movie for."
4,magic mike movie,I liked the movie although I thought at times it was a little silly. I bought the movie because I heard about the dancingThe male dancing was just great and their bodies were outstanding. Had an all friends party to watch the movie enjoyed by all..
4,Not bad,Not bad. The dancing was Kool. Wish I could move like that. Story was ok. I would give it a 3.5 but decided to go with a 4.
1,Horrible movie,"except for the hot bodies and fine faces this movie is so stupid, has the worst ending I have ever seen in a movie"
2,No plot,This movie was terrible. There was no plot to speak of and a ton of swearing and nonsensical nudity. Wish I hadn't wasted my time
4,It is what you would expect.,"This movie is pretty much what you would (and should) expect. No great story line, but the eye candy is good enough to keep it moving and fairly entertaining. The dance scenes with Channing Tatum are the best and I wish that there was more of him dancing. I've always loved him and he has still got the moves. So if you in the mood for some fun, mindless, entertainment, I think you'll enjoy it."
2,Cheesy,"The dancing was weak. Matthew McConaughey was cheesy. The best part was in the beginning when he is talking about what the audience can touch. Channing Tatum is a skilled dancer, but he basically did the same moves over and over. The story line was predictable. I know really we ladies watch this for the stripping but that was pretty lame too, with very little cloths coming off. Overall just a lame movie."
2,Not worth renting - couldn't watch the whole movie,"Absolutely no plot. If you're looking for a movie that brings you to a strip club and stays there, with the occasional scene of gratuitous sex, drugs and nudity - this is your movie."
2,Was hoping it'd be funnier...,"Was I the only one that was hoping this would be hilarious? I mean my expectations weren't that high as far as plot goes (movie about male strippers right?) but they were high as far as what I want out of a romantic comedy. Boy, was I disappointed. I don't know how a movie that had a near constant half-naked Channing Tatum could go that wrong but I wanted to turn this dark untoned movie off about halfway through. But, if you're curious like I was and need to see it for the sake of seeing it, go to Redbox or something, don't pay full for this movie."
4,I like it,Story line was ok. Obviously people are going to watch it because of Channing and the stripping buuuuuut I loved the choreography and THAT is why I bought it!
2,Magic Mike,"I thought the movie was immature and corny. Dancing segments were okay, but otherwise the movie drags. Would not recommend."
3,Not what I thought.....,"Very little Matthew! Not at all what the trailers showed. It was ""just okay""pretty poor storyline.Wouldn't buy it."
2,Disappointed,I was disappointed and did not really enjoy this movie. That is the end of my review so the end.
3,It's Okay,sure great as 'eye candy' but story line wasn't well developed. Movie tended to be in very slow in spots.
1,Magic Mike,"The best description of this movie is ""terrible"". The plot was weak, the dialogue was flat and it appeared that the director gave the actors some broad brush premise to work with and then told them to ad-lib the lines."
3,Better than expected,"I didn't know much about this before I rented it and had low expectations. More dance scenes, better quality dance scenes, more plot than expected. The ending was anti-climactic. Expected more depth from Matthew McCounahey <sp> character."
1,Second worst movie of 2012,"I must admit I knew this movie would be a disappointment but I was bored. Alas, I am even more disappointed as now my suspicions have been confirmed. This really is a bad movie. If there is a record for the number of times the F word has been used in a movie, I am quite sure Magic Mike would be the frontrunner. Is it called writing when ever other word is profane. I think a 16 year boy could have written a better script. Channing Tatum's body is nice but skip the movie it is not worth it."
3,I should have listened to the other reviews.,"It's was just ok.Even though I read the other reviews, I still wanted to see it b/c of Channing Tatum."
3,Lotta hype; doesn't deliver,Lame story --- bad production values -- all in all not a very professionally produced movie. Would never recommend it
2,Even Channing couldn't help this one,"This movie is also, limited character development and even Channing couldn't help and they wasted Matthew Bomer's many talents, it is a shame!"
1,Hated it!,One of the worst films I've seen all year! Wish that I could get a refund on the rental! Don't waste your money!
3,Magic Mike,All dance scenes were amazing. Story line was cheesy and not believable. Overall good movie to see with your girlfriends.
3,B is for Beefcake,"What I would call a B rated movie, it was ok and passed the time. Not really a thought provoker and not really great if porn is your goal. Difficult to watch with a mixed group .. thus the low rating."
1,Disappointing,Neither the acting or storyline were very good. Guess you'd have to enjoy going to strip clubs to find the movie appealing.
5,"THIS MOVIE IS WARM TOUCHING,AND ALSO FUNNY","MAGIC MIKE IS WARM,TOUCHING AND FUNNY. WATCH IT ONCE AND YOU WILL BE HOOKED!HOT MEN, GOOD PERFORMANCES.,FUN FOR ALL."
1,No magic here.,"God, this was awful!!! The trailer made it look lighthearted and funny, but it's FAR from that! It was kind of a downer, and kind of gross as the nudity and sexual content was gratuitous and in poor taste. And I hear they're making a sequel??!The only plus is that Channing Tatum is a very good dancer and good eye candy. But I was mad that I spent money on a ticket for this one."
1,seriously?,Badly done movie. How did they make a male stripper movie boring? It's like The Last Airbender meets the awkward scenes in Twilight...and then of course the only good things in this film were the dancing scenes. BAD movie. Regret buying it.
1,Horrible Movie,"0 plot and completely un believable, I ve seen bond movies with less farfetched plots than this. Really really bad"
1,Absolutely awful movie,"Phony stilted acting. Adolescent plot. Didn't pass a basic requirement: no one I could like, so I didn't care. Didn't merit even one star, but I couldn't erase the star."
2,Great eye-candy but absymal story line,"Horrible horrible movie as to plot. Great movie for buff bodies and hot stripper action! It was all I could do to sit through the drivel until the ""good parts"" came on!"
5,good,I am a guy surprisingly good:) good story good actors . Didn't want to watch but once I started I wanted to see the outcome.
4,Better Than One or Two Stars,"There are people giving this bad feedback. It was never meant to qualify for an Oscar. It was meant for fun, mostly for women, and it definitely delivers. I saw it twice and enjoyed it both times. Can hardly wait for the Blu-ray to come out so I can see the complete dances. Women never get movies made for them, but men always do. Ignore the low feedback reviews and rent the movie if you want to see it, but be sure to rent the Blu-ray copy. That's the one that's going to be the most fun. Personally, I want this around so I can drool any time I want to...some gorgeous men in there."
