5,"Now, for something totally new","And the Spirit doesn't strike again! That Will Eisner is a master of the ilustrated narrative everyone knew, but that he was a master of political causes, well, I didn't know. One had glimpses of it, from his string of Graphic Novels, dealing with racial tensions, housing issues, and other questions, but they all seemed to have something to do with the story, it was never the ""issue"" for the issue. Now, with the history of the infamous libel, the protocols of the elders of zion, this can be almost considered a school book: it's didactic, it has a clear theme presentation methodology, it clearifies the reaserch method... A must read!"
2,Title Misleading,"I don't know if the Protocols were made up (Plagerized) or not.....and it doesn't really make alot difference. All one has to do read the document for themself and and reflect on recent historyie., the past 100 years. Also read the (online) book Waters Flowing Eastward [esp part II sec 1]. If all this stuff was made I must say the author had a heckova furtile imagination.The problem I have with this book is the title is misleading. It sound like it is supporting the""protocols"" but is really attempting to debunk them and in my opinion it didn't do a good job."
2,Not That Impressed...,"This was just the kind of book I needed, but as it turned out, this particular one did not impress. The pages are not removable for easy copying, and there were some spelling mistakes that I came across in the few pages I actually wanted to use. Kind of surprising in a book written by a language arts teacher."
3,Recommended age groups should be lowered,"I don't think this is a tool that is age-appropriate for the higher age groups (6th-8th) and really can't be (and no reason to be) modified for high school. There are several sheets to aid in illustrated stories, and effective worksheets to help with beginning to intermediate readers."
1,"If you're looking for real ""low carb"" this isn't it","The book contains a reasonable number of recipes and lots of 'hints' that if you've done ANY reading about low carbohydrate eating, will be superfluous.The recipes run the gamut of carb counts, though I thought that the bulk of them were much higher carb than is helpful. Following the suggestions in this book and the recipes, it wouldn't be all that hard to hit 80-100++ grams of carb per day... which is simply TOO HIGH for many people who are following low carb lifestyles.Many recipes call for sugar, white flour, semi-sweet chocolate and cornstarch. Come ON... those are NOT ""low carb"" ingredients.This is more or less a repackaged low fat/lower cal cookbook with ""low carb"" thrown on the cover to try to generate some market share. My copy is being donated to a charity, it isn't worth the space on the shelf for someone interested in real ""low carb"" cooking."
5,A True Rage Fan Will Buy This Cd,"If you are a true rage fan you will buy this album. If you have been with Rage since their debut album in 1992 and own the other 4 albums you definitely should buy this cd. This is a great way to catch Rage's liveliness in one last CD.If you don't own any other Rage Against the Machine albums, but are interested in their music, then I would recommend the 1999 release THE BATTLE OF LOS ANGELES."
2,why buy this?,Why would you buy this audio CD when the DVD version sometimes costs less and includes more material?
4,Great book for GUI design,Great book on how to design a graphical user interface correctly. Very useful if you want to follow Microsoft's user standards (and why wouldn't you).
4,Interesting reading with good practical application,"I purchased for a class, the reading is easy to understand and this new edition has a chapter related to culture and leadership that previous editions don't have which I found useful. Overall a good book worth reading."
3,School work,This book was required reading. It was easy reading and easily understood. It was not something that I would of read for leisure.
1,My seller did not send me the book,"Amazon employees,Please help me get my money back. The seller did not send me the book.Thanks"
5,"The how, when, why and what of leadership theories",This book explores the very foundation of leadership theories and unfolds the essence of all different leadership types. This book explains indepth what all the other popular best sellers only tries to discusses superficially.
5,Wonderful Journal!,"I have the paperback copy of this book and am ordering my second copy. My original is very worn. I have been using it for the last many years (nearly ten) to collect inspirational quotes in. I write one quote per day and it is nearly completed!Now I am buying a second copy to transfer the old quotes into, change some around and so forth. I had been putting them in almost randomly, but I want to rewrite them to correlate better with the Goddess days that Diane cites."
4,My daughter LOVES these dolls!,I recently purchased a Trollz doll for my 8 year old daughter. She has many of the Bratz and Barbie dolls and I was looking to get her something new. She LOVES Topaz. She won't put the doll down - even brought her to the dinner table last night. Today she told me that I was the best father in the world! Now of course I have to go buy the rest of the set...
2,Disappointed 25 dollars later!!,"I first downloaded this album on itunes; the production was so sketchy I thought itunes had ripped me off. So, I went to the store and bought a hard copy. Yes!! I love this band enough to buy their new album twice in the same day. But to my surprise the production quality was the same! Song structure is not on par with their previous albums either. The vocals are way to far in the back and you hear constant buzzing. I'm not saying this album is horrible I think these guys couldn't write horrible if they wanted to. However, the album was not what I have come to appreciate about this band. I have always loved their use of metaphors and story telling, the attempt at aggression on this album seems immature. Of course I'll still buy their next album anyway (THERE G.D. BAD RELIGON)"
5,Bad Religion never lets us down,"Just like every other BR album this one is great. always a treat to listen to this band. The only thing better is to go see these guys live, they put on a great show. A must have for any Bad Religion fan."
3,Good.,"Bad Religion is one of those bands that deserve all the praise they get. 30 years playing in a punk band and still going strong. Now this is their latest release and its good but far far far off from being a masterpiece or anything. It's good to listen to all the way through but thats because i cant think of one song I'd want to listen to. No tracks are going to be too memorable on this one. But its still good and I will buy their next album. Oh and in my opinion, the cover to this album looks sick."
4,Backward and Forward,"I've got a soft spot for this band.I was concerned, reading these reviews, that we had another No Substance on our hands.I bit the bullet and bought the album tonight and even smiled, occasionally, as I listened to it.They've tapped into their past energy but taken it in a new direction, combining good, solid melodies with speed and focus.I'll have to give it a few more listens but I'm relieved to be able to say that this album far exceeds the admittedly low expectations that I had for it."
2,Blah blah.. New America II??,"I love these guys and if I had the option for a 1.5 stars I would have given it. I own all the albums (even Into the Unknown which was it's own whole fiasco) and this one sounds like dirty dish water compared to all but the New America album. I'm not sure if these guys are done or if this is just that bad album every epic band puts out once a decade. I sincerely hope this album is just a mistake, because they're just that good....Don't buy this album. Pick up ""Recipe for Hate"" or ""Suffer"" and enjoy some classic punk!"
2,"uh, NO!","I love Dr. Who and I really am an avid anime fan, I tried this on a whim but the stop motion choppiness and the audio matching was just too horrible. If someone were to fix the animation it might be fine but the hole is too big as it is now. Now to mention the quick wrap up of the plot line, it was extremely rough holding it together in parts and the ending was just too rushed. Perhaps this is a nice experiment? I say keep experimenting, this could have some potential, but you need to get better from here, just a quick point or no-one is going to watch further episodes."
2,Fangirl unimpressed with this animated version,Don't waste your time! The animation and graphics are basic and unremarkable. I love David Tennant and I continue to follow the series with Matt Smith as the current doctor but I would not recommend this purchase.
3,what did he say?,"I read the reviews for purchasing this animated movie. The animation did not bother me, but the sound did. Music and sound effects were too loud and I couldn't hear what the characters were saying most of the time. Didn't the creators listen to it before they put it out on the market! As a fan of doctor who, I would have enjoyed it if I could have heard it."
5,An easy to read book about the gift and power of salvation.,You won't be able to put this one down. I apply what I learned from this book to my everyday life. You will fall in love with Jesus and it will change your life.
5,Wolf's Rain soundtrack volume one,"This a replacement CD for me. My orignal copy kept falling out of its case. Tracks 5-7 were damanaged, so I bought a replacement. The music is varied,and interesting. Kanno did a magnificent job of scoring this this show. The different styles of music don't clash, but blend together nicely."
2,I bought it only because of rebate from Brother.,"This model is pretty old and uncomfortable for use. However, it can make copies and send and receive faxes.Caller ID screen changes every second and makes it hard to see the number.I have Panasonic phone and use fax for its direct work only. It does it."
3,Freedom Road mini review,"Poor quality film, good story, very dark... I had to write a 7 page summary on this book, so i watched the movie and then read the last chapter of the book because i was told the endings were different."
4,Dinah Was & Is Great Listening,"I was very excited when I came across this live performance recording, as I had the privilege of seeing Ms. Freeman in the role of Dinah Washington. Listening to the recording is like reliving the evening of seeing her sublime performance.My only disappointment it is one continuous track on each CD. No tracking or listing of songs. Still very entertaining & enjoyable.Dinah Was (L.A. Theatre Works Audio Theatre Collection)"
1,Failed after 8 seconds,"Yeah, 8 seconds, then a pop and nothing. You wouldn't think it would be hard to connect a wire between two points, but I guess it is. Since my home theater is now apart waiting for this cable, I guess I'm off to a brick and mortar store."
2,CSET French Review,"The book is helpful in reviewing, BUT it has at least 10 typos on each page!!!! The editor is sleeping on the job. Accents are not always included, just sometimes when the editor remembers. The word ""vowel"" was mispelled as ""vowell"" and a whole lot of little things. I didn't know if I could believe the explanations for answers when the person doesn't even know how to spell ""vowel""!"
3,basically a datebook,This organizer is going to serve me well this year - but it doesn't have any magical qualities that a datebook and some stickers wouldn't have too. The perforated shopping lists are a nice touch but they ruin the book for anyone who wants to save the book as a record of the past year. I like that the book has both monthly pages as well as big squares to write daily activities but that does make me feel that I need to write everything down twice.
4,Hidden Star,I am a great fan of Nora Roberts and I have not found a book that I did not like yet. I was on edge most of the book wondering what was going to happen. she keeps me very interested and don't want to put it down. I can't wait for the other two to come out and I will read them too.
3,"Historically important, but","like many of Michaux's film's, that's about it. Whilke he was a pioneer, he wasn't a great director. Sad, but unfortunately true. Body & Soul is worth watching for Robeson's film debut alone, but don't expect anything great. Thanks to bad staging and a horribly edited/re-piece job, he comes across as semi-wooden. Few of the title cards match the ""speaking,"" and there are far too few in several spots. As one reveiwer aptly put it, much of this is almost incomprehensible."
3,looked better on the web,these blinds do the job but they are cheap and look cheap. I expected something with a little better quality
2,NO CONSISTENCY,"Ordered 2 white 33"" blinds and was very happy when fitting the first one and it fit perfectly. Then opened the second box and realized that the color didn't match the first one. It's too much of a hassle so I didn't return either of them. I need to order 4 more but might try to see if the Alabaster color will be more consistent."
2,History of Art Ed,"I know that I ordered this book knowing that it would be ""dry"" reading but then found while looking through it that I wasn't even interested in the history of Art Ed, I'm only interested in what's happening now! So, I really can't review a book that I haven't even read!"
5,Great player,"He was really a great player, one of those players I admire despite not ever getting to see him play. I believe he is also one of the most underrated players ever, had he been Italian or Argentinian, he would be compared to the Di Stefano's or Pele"
3,Not all that helpful,"In my opinion, this book is not nearly as good as the companion book, ""The Healing Power of Grief"". It tells the story of 12 couples who found love after the death of a spouse, but I don't feel that the information contained in these stories would be that helpful to a widow or widower since everyone's situation is so different. Most of the couples in the book are living together and don't seem motivated to marry and that was a disappointment to me. There are times when I was reading about the physical intimacy between the couples that I wanted to shout ""Too much information"". The book seems to imply that the only way to recover from the death of a spouse is to begin a relationship with someone else and I believe that to be patently false. I do recommend the companion book, ""The Healing Power of Grief"" which includes a lot of solid information and advice."
4,More drumming please.,"Lot's of energy. Great drumming, we need performances like this avaliable states side. Watching the DVD is nice, but seeing it live would be so much better. Great DVD."
5,A book to savor,"You can just taste the South! This book is as deliciously wonderful and comfortable as a cup of the best coffee and your favorite chair. Knowing many of the places written about, my own experiences seemed to twirl around in my thoughts and in my heart as I read each story. The Southern life is simple, yet elegantly told in The Ivy Stays Green. Janet Brice Parker is a brilliant writer. As I read, I could imagine her noticing many details others have, and probably still do, overlook during life. She very respectfully and purposefully depicts the very nature of Southern nuggets of humor, love, and heartfelt moments.I have read these stories twice, so far. Each time, finding something else to ponder and savor. This is a book I keep displayed and within easy reach from my favorite chair, here in the South. I actually have a small coffee drop on page 128.I love to give books as gifts and this one makes a perfect present!"
5,Very Tight,I met these guys at there show in Denver - very cool and down to earth - and it shows in their music. They are a very tight band with a killer sound. This CD is awesome - I hate to call it NU-METAL....these guys are deeper than that. Pick it up - you will not be upset.
3,Some decent MOMENTs.,"If you take some SEVENDUST, a scoop of DISTURBED, mix with some fleeting original songwriting tricks and you end up with STEREOMUD, a hard rocking act that is not really anything special but better than a lot of the newer hard rock 'metal' bands. Strong points include some inventive guitar riffs, pro traps, and some nice hooky vocals by singer ERIK ROGERS. EVERY GIVEN MOMENT suffers around track 7 when the songs begin to blend and STEREOMUD's sound echoes borrowed chops. A nice adrenalin high with some kick but not enough to kick your [butt], MOMENT is merely a decent sounding distraction."
1,"Greek Fire, Poison Arrows & Scorpion Bombs: Biological and C","This book had such good potential to inform the mass readership. Instead it ended up being what it always was an academic tome that a few people would be interested in. Instead of really discussing any one subject, Ms. Mayor jumped around the entire universe of weapons of mass destruction. In the end, all she said was that weapons of mass destruction have been around since antiquity. It would have been better for Ms. Mayor to devote a chapter on the methods by which the Mongols changed the course of history with their introduction of the plague in warfare, or a chapter on the impact Greek fire on the ancient world. She merely devoted a few paragraphs to such truly interesting things."
1,"Chock full of facts, but wild with conclusions","No where else have I seen such accounts of ancient warfare. Her descriptions are entertaining and the facts interesting. In the hands of a good writer this subject matter would be wonderful, but alas, the book is poorly written. The author defines chemical and biological warfare so unlike our contemporary concepts that it is difficult overcome while reading. Many of her conclusions and comparisons to modern day warfare are dubious and at times I wondered if the book were a bit tainted with religious bigotry."
3,Finlands finest,"A great 3 piece featuring piano, bass, and drums. Saw them perform live early this year and they were fantastic. The album swings from energetic and paranoid, to smooth and elegant."
1,Rape is not romantic- don't waste your money,"I went into this novel with high expectations. The heroine is feisty and the hero seemed at least somewhat sympathetic, if a bit chauvanistic. But then the characters get married, and it's all downhill from there. Sexual assault is never sexy and like another reviewer said, it has no place in a romance novel... The only thing that could have saved this book would have been if the heroine found some other guy to love and left, but of course, she falls in love with the...loser. Don't waste your money on this book- I'm still bitter that I wasted mine."
5,It's a Keeper,"This is one that will not leave my book shelf ... H is an alpha to 9th degree ... h is likable, smart and lovable ... when they connect it is hot, hot, hot ... I loved the whole thing ... if you're a romance junkie, you need to read this ..."
3,like the title says,"Lewd, lusty, and laugh-out-loud funny. Sometimes even clever. Not as good as it's predecessor, but still a fun read."
1,you get what you pay for,"listen to me now, you get what you pay for with this card. It is a lemon. This card can not keep up with the software today. I would not recommend this to anyone who wants to display any type of graphics on the screen. However, if you're looking for a card that displays bare minimum for microsoft office and stuff, look no further. Save yourself some money if you're not going to work with graphics."
3,All they had to do was Transfer the original,"I have to agree with everyone here on the censorship issue. I was extremely ______ because it was _______ !!! (use whatever cuss words you find necessary). I guess they were worried about getting in trouble, like getting a bad name, racist issues or whatever. You know how some people are, they would start something and I guess that's what they're thinking. Anyways, the original Wolfenstein 3D is classic, just like Doom. The SNES version is in no comparison but it's still worth playing. This game is pretty rare now. If you beat Return to Castle Wolfenstein: Tides of War, you will be able to play the original."
2,It would have been nice if....,"I browsed all the choices for a practice chanter and determined, based on brand and price, that this one was my best bet. However, it would have been nice if Dunbar would have mentioned, maybe just in passing or in some fine print somewhere, that THE REED IS NOT INCLUDED!! You find this slightly important fact out upon receipt of your chanter where it is noted explicitly on your invoice that there is no reed included. Again, in taking the time to note this on the invoice (complete with recommendation of which one to get), it would have been nice if they noted it on their online ad as well. Or better yet, and this is just a suggestion, just include the reed with the chanter. It would be nice."
5,works for me,I was glad to finally find a replacement for the ones I had lost. I have used these for several years and have tried others that have no way given me as good results. They work great for me.
4,"Good story, terrible dustcover","Forget the TERRIBLE picture on the cover (can somebody please shoot that artist please?), this is just a wonderful story about life, love and all you need to know when you want to start an escort agency of your own ;-)))"
1,Couldn't Not Put It Down,"I couldn't finish this book. It was so rife with cliche's (I mean the literary kind), cumbersome adverbs, and editorialization that I found it pandering at best. The question is; to whom? The author?"
5,This is a GREAT FRAME for your desk,It holds a small photo of your cat - or whatever - you can set it on your desk - it doesn't need a stand. It's purrfect!
3,Not as good as some of the other Mr. Man books.,"It's a good book for any child under the age of 10, as most Mr. Man books are. But it's not as cleverly written. It's difficult to review a children's book as such, but it doesn't have an interesting plot and it doesn't do much to hold ones attention as Mr. Happy, Mr. Bounce or Mr. Messy. It's okay, but I would have picked out another Mr. Man book instead had I known this."
3,"Very dry, but good reference materials included","This program covers the basics of French, as advertised. What they fail to mention is that it is as dry as toast -- not one illustration, not one bit of ""learning French can be fun."" If you are very self-motivated, this will cover what you need at an attractive price. If you aren't self-motivated, it's going to bore you to tears.That being said, the reference materials, a basic French grammar guide in the back of the lesson book and a separate French learner's dictionary, are excellent references to have on hand while you study with a more entertaining program."
2,For true nutrition fanatics,"This book was not very helpful for me at all. I am glad to have it among my endometriosis arsenal, but the intense recommendations for all the nutritional changes you need to follow were just too much for me. I have taken several supplements and changed my diet a little, but had already done that prior to reading this book. There was nothing in here that really helped me. If you are someone who is willing to put in a LOT of time and effort and changes with your food, then this is an excellent book for you. Otherwise, unless you are just curious, I would suggest skipping it."
5,"Learn to Go, Grow, and Glow with God!","Tommy Barnett's book Multiplication is yet another tribute to his seemingly boundless inspiration and vision. Barnett lists 40 factors in a brief, page-and-a-half format that makes this book ideal for use as a daily devotional. Chapters such as Factor #9: Don't Waste Your Time, or Factor #5: Be Call Driven, Not Burden Driven are two excellent examples of Barnett's straightforward, future-oriented Christ-like approaches to Multiplication. A must read for every staff member and lay leader in the Church!"
2,Of limited use.,"Like Tetris and Scrabble had a baby.It's not much fun after the 7th or 8th level.The letter tiles are coming down too fast at that point to try to form a word. Basically, you'll be setting down a letter and see if you made a 3+ letter word. Best feature is the odd foreign circus graphic that changes w/ each level. If you want a fun SNES puzzle game, try Wario's Woods."
5,Fascinating Reading,"It is certainly true that fact is sometimes stranger than fiction. This was my first foray into the true crime genre, and now I'm hooked! Contrary to the opinions of a couple of other reviewers, I felt this book was an unbiased and well-written account of frightening events of which most of us Mormons are unaware. If you're only interested in Mormon-faith-promoting material, I wouldn't recommend this book. If you're interested in truth, this book is excellent reading."
1,Mostly fiction,"Based on actual events, it is rife with fictitious quotes that make the participants look like charicatures. It would be impossible for them to have chronicled the dialogues that are quoted. The authors must have interviewed the participants much later and then pieced together the dialogue, but instead of being summarized, they dishonestly portray them as actual quotes. The entire book is obviously a ""hit piece"" intended to discredit the Mormon Church, and they miss no opportunity to do so. Instead of the historical accuracy they claim, this is a largely fictionalized attack on the church. If you want to know what really happened, don't waste your time reading this trash."
1,spoiled merchandice,"""Streetnoise"" by Brian Auger and Julie Driscoll - This product is a rare and difficult album/CD to locate and thus expensive. The sonic quality is good; but out of the sixteen tracks, tracks 7,8,9 & 10 refuse to play. Thus, this product and merchant disappoints. I would like to exchange it but supposedly it was the only copy available."
4,Like a charm...,"After much Amazon perusing, I decided to pick this reader to use with my Powerbook and Digital Rebel. So far it has worked great. The Firewire means very speedy downloads while I can just switch CF cards in my camera and keep shooting. I definitely recommend getting this if you're working with large photo files and OS X."
4,Thanks!,I ordered this bench early in January being content with the projected delivery date of January 31. It actually came the very next week! What a happy surprise! It was easy to set up and easy to use. Thanks Mercantila and Amazon!
5,Kids!,This movie is great for children. There are many songs and a lot of different colors and fun things for toddlers as well. I would recommend it.
5,I Love It!!!,"I've had this video for longer than I can imagine, and I still love it! I found myself watching it just last night and I was singing along! I thought I had forgotten the words by now.... it's a great tape for any age (if they're a kid at heart) and it will take the viewer through an amazing world of imagination and fun. ^_^"
4,BOOM AINT IT GREAT TO BE CRAZY!,This movie is great for young kids 4and under. I take it when I babysit. Recomemnded deeply by all parents and sitters. Keeps kids active and in one place for over 1 hour. Loved video.
1,"Imus is a waste, his book is a waste.","Look, Imus is an weathered old fuddy-duddy. Everything he says sounds childish and stupid. For a real book read Howard Stern's Private Parts of Miss America. Those are books by a radio genius."
1,Poorly done,"To learn Thai, first of all the English person needs to hear the words slowly and with a degree of repetition. This poorly executed tapes is merely the author saying a trailer trash phrase in English and having it repeated by his bargirl girlfriend. A true waste of money for anyone attempting to learn Thai"
1,Badly done,"I bought the book and the tapes. In the book there is no index, there is no word for word translation so one knows what words mean. Just a bunch of phrases with a hopefully accurate translation - though from what I've read here that may be suspect. Meanwhile the tapes are spoken in rapid fire Thai and there is no chance to learn the pronunciation. Overall this is a poor effort"
2,"Maybe Deserves a 3 star, all so subjective","Melvin Bukeit is a talented writer, no questions on that score. In ""Strange Fire"" what bothered me was Bukiet's cavalier attitude towards his locale: the mideast. His agility and cleverness with languge miss the beat here. He's not a writer who creates caring toward his bizarre (in good and bad sense) characters, nor about their situations. I think he needs to amplify his ability with words with heart. That is just one man's honest opinion. Because, without heart and soul, for lack of better words, the plot isn't intimately gripping."
5,Classic productions of classic GBS,THese are BBC productions from the 1970's and 1980's. They are follow the scripts of the original plays to the letter. The acting is first rate. They use a theatrical form with the action taking place on one set for each act. as a big fan of GBS these are a wonderful addition to my library. They are bargain priced to boot. My only regret is that more GBS is not available.
5,Memories,This has brought back memories from High School for my husband and I. Good Classic old Rock and Roll!! I hate the hair but love the music!!
1,Don't waste your money.,"This is not only a socialist piece of trash. It is poorly written. It is the same old misguided ""profits are bad garbage."" I bought it when it first came out in the early 1980's. It was one of the worst investments I ever made. Don't waste your money."
2,Difficult reading.,"""Democracy Realized: the progressive alternative"" by Roberto Mangabeira Unger is a very difficult book to read. K S Sastry, the only other purchaser/reviewer to date, summarizes the book fairly, but I wish Verso, the book's publisher, had hired a very good writer of English text to work with the author to make this book much more readable. Throughout the book the author consistently uses very complex sentences and complex vocabulary with the result that this book is one of the most difficult to read of any books that I have tried to read.I believe that Unger has very worthwhile ideas and I wish I understood what he is saying to a greater extent than I can manage with the current text. I am sure the text is worth much more effort by the publisher to make it more readable. At present, I think the text is too difficult for most undergraduate college level readers or casual readers of economics or politics.Be sure to try to read the book before purchasing it."
2,It arrives broken !,"Pitty this CD arrive ""completely"" broken (look at the box !) and it takes time and it costs to send it back to the supplier, when it will be easier to send me another one... But who cares ?Some suppliers are more conciliatory and does not ask for a review until the correct product has been deliveried. Sorry for that."
2,Didn't get the hang of it,I didn't like this game. You constantly walk aroung through a maze and it is so easy to get lost and by the time you find your way out some of your party members have already been killed off. You can't save the game until you back at the inn. This definitely is not my favorite video game.
4,Great Escape,"First, let me say that this book is worth your time. It starts off slow, but don't let that put you off. There is a lot of detail. It pay attention to the details, so you get to know the characters. I enjoyed the fact that just like in real life, things change, and you have to go in a different direction. The battles are done well. I expected them to go one way and it went another. I enjoy being suprised. Unanticipated deaths will shock you. I look forward to part 2."
3,HBHG was much better than Messianic Legacy,"I enjoyed HBHG which traced the Merovingian bloodline. However, Messianic Legacy was a bit of a let-down after HBHG. The authors attempt to search for the historical Jesus rather than the Gospel-inspired son-of-God version of Jesus. The obviously arrive at a version that is significantly at odds with the Church. So far so good (in fact, Part One which deals with this is very well written and is written using many sources that have been used in another fiction novel that I recently read,The Rozabal Line). The problem is that the Prieure de Sion is a joke. And hence it become difficult to digest part three of this book. My personal opinion: Read HBHG but not necessarily this book."
1,AS IMPORTANT AS THE LATEST ELVIS SIGHTING,"WRITTEN IN THE LATEST PULP FICTION,COMIC BOOK SYNTAX,AND WITH ABOUT AS MUCH EVIDENTIARY MATERIAL AS THE RUN OF THE MILL U.F.O.INCIDENT.I AM ALWAYS AMAZED AT THE TRIPE THE AMERICAN READING PUBLIC WILL EMBRACE"
3,These Old Shades of the Grand Sophy,"I bought this book because I LOVE the author's writing in her own name of Helen Chappell. And because I am a fan of Georgette Heyer, who indeed was ""peerless"".While not difficult to read at one sitting, I found the story to be quite a reprise on Heyer's Grand Sophy, with a bit of Sylvester and Arabella thrown in.It is difficult to believe that the ""peerless"", uppity, confident and competent Theodosia would fall apart and act stupidly in running away from a situation that she could have so easily controlled!Sorry, ""Rebecca""! So glad you grew up to be a much better writer of much better fiction! Another Sam and Hollis, please!"
4,This Is The Real Thing,"Ok, there is definately a slant from the NC folks here because we LOVE our girl SO much. That being said, I saw Tift & band live three times this year. This CD captures their live show with all of the talent & energy that Tift and band produce. What a talented group of folks Tift has in her band. Buy this CD immediately before they are gone. Why? Because it is great! My only complaint & reason for rating 4 stars is the lack of songs. I was at the NC Museum of Art show when this was recorded & the setlist was MUCH longer. I regret the closing number not be included which inncluded former Carbine members & current Chatham County Line members who sang their hearts out on ""I Shall Be Released"". Also, the banter between Tift & the audience was eidited out which loses some of the live feel & makes it sound more like a studio album. I still love this CD & can't wait for Volume II."
2,"Already doing a ""best of"" album?",I really do like Tift Merritt's other CDs but this 9 song mini-album appears to be nothing more than a marketing thing. Something new would have been exciting and worth buying.
3,INFORMER,"I found the review to be good. But, I seek information on name, address and e-mails of the LITERARY AGENTS OF ART MOVIES(FEATURE FILMS) IN USA for my forthcoming film.Sincerely yoursApurba Chakraborty"
4,Relatively thorough reference.,"This is an invaluable reference to keep close at hand if you are a programmer supporting UNIX. The only thing I didn't find in this text is how to change your process name on-the-fly. Everything else I've looked for was there, and in most cases, described in detail.If you do systems programming on UNIX then you should have this book."
3,Comprehensive,"This book contains the answers to almost any question concerning communication, concurrency and threads. All of the included code works fine, but is often ugly. At least the ugly code is available online if you are too lazy to write your own, or type it yourself.3 stars because this book follows the typical computer book pattern. It's too big. Huge examples and discussion for rarely used features, when a table enumerating specifics would be better. There is alot of fluff, but at least the material is there."
5,Excellent starting ground to do Unix Programming,"I used this book to start to learn from scratch how to programming Unix. This book is self-contained,concise and easy to read. FYI, it is very readable and not dry. There's a number of good diagrams, for example,illustrating file descriptors allocations and the effects of system calls like dup2, etc. The authors uses short code snipplet to illustrate how to use a particular system calls, which I think is rather neat. A number of ""projects"" very quickly help reader to expand their skill level. Of interest is also a project on distributed ""Richard"" and ""Linda"" , the forerunner of Sun's JINI. The authors could have expanded this book another 100 pages and make it a companion to Steven's ""Advanced Unix System Programming"". I strongly recommend this book to beginners, intermediate Unix Programmers."
1,Not what I thought it was.,I would have wanted to know that it was not a book full length. It was something they might pass out on a house tour. It should not be listed in book form.
3,Good for beginners,"This is the DVD that really introduced me to the kettlebell motions. I started out using a 5-lb dumbbell and I really felt it the next day.Then I progressed to more kettlebell specific DVDs and learned more technique.When I came back to this DVD to use it with my kettlebell, I still like the exercises, but her form is all wrong for anyone using a kettlebell. And anyone new to kettlebells--using this DVD--will more than likely be injured if they actually use a kettlebell--which is ironic. Someone else pointed out two of my complaints--she doesn't rack the weight, and it goes too fast if you're using proper technique--but the most dangerous thing she does is switch the weight overhead. It's not just potentially injurious--it's potentially lethal if a 10-lb weight slips and cracks your skull.I can recommend using this DVD with a dumbbell, but if you really want to learn about using a kettlebell, look elsewhere."
2,Weak - Not a Very Good Overview of Germany,"I have visited many parts of Germany and I can tell you that this video is not a very good representation of Germans or life in Germany. The video is very superficial and the two hosts obviously weren't very knowledgable about Germany which made it difficult to watch. It didn't teach you much about German history and won't help you much if you are planning to visit Germany as a tourist and want a video to help you with your planning.I suggest passing on this one. If you want a good DVD on Germany, Rick Steves, Rudy Maxa, and Samantha Brown have all made much better quality DVDs about Germany."
3,very poor quality,"The footage on this DVD is very dated, at least 20 years. The quality of the photography and the audio is extremely poor. The narration seems adequate and accurate, but I was detracted by the poor overall quality. This was a waste of money."
2,Didn't fit well,These didn't fit my GM vehicle well at all either even though they were a match. The mats were very rigid and where they overlapped in the middle my truck also had a small hump - which made matters worse as far as fitment goes. I returned these and went with the OEM factory one piece rear all weather mat.
1,Great Product - Shipping is a RIP OFF,"I love this stuff, and I jumped as soon as I saw it was back in stock. It works great, honestly. I usually order 10 tubes at a time.But to charge $5.00+ PER ITEM to ship? That is insanity!!! And I know it hasn't always been like this. Why the change? I don't know. I can only assume it's to rip people off and I am not happy about it."
4,Great for Mild acne!,"I am a teenager and I have been dealing with acne since middle school. I've tried all of acne gels but they never worked. Either they were drying and irritating my skin or it made my face really oily.My doctor prescribed me this and my skin has gotten so much better. It really helps the pimples go away. At first, my face wasn't used to it but after a few appliance, my face got used to it. This gel drys immediately after you apply it which is a major plus for me! I apply it everynight before I go to sleep. From the past products I used, I would wake up with a very oily face but I don't experience that with this this. I finally found a product that works for my skin!!My only complaint is that it takes kinda long to get rid of those cyst-type acne. Other than that, I love it."
5,just like india abuse,"I think this album is the same as the first India abuse album. Heavy on the digital bass, it is all about the chill. One of the best by Muslimguaze. I recommend this album to anyone who doesn't already have the India Abuse album. Rock it While driving, Slow, Glowing, And holding the lane."
4,check your warranty,"Before you go buying these, you may want to check your warranty. If you have registered your grill and you are within 10 years of purchase it may benefit you to call Weber. That is one of the good things about a premium priced grill, a company that backs up the parts. I called them and they gladly looked up my reg info and shipped me out a burner and flavorizer bars (which I purchased)."
3,Sing a Song of England: A social history of traditional song (Documents of social history) [Hardcover],Amazon verified purchase. The copy was cheap and met the requirements of my grandson studying at university. It was in fair condition but had obviously been stored in a damp place.
2,Weak arguments,"I actually agreed with Bruegmann's thesis more before I read this book than afterwards. He's married to his one definition of sprawl, and since this conveniently lists Los Angeles as the least sprawled city, he can then use this as a blunt weapon to pooh-pooh any criticism of sprawl. He also notes that sprawl has been a force throughout the history of cities, but then fails to show how the issues people have with sprawl may have evolved over the years. Even when he mentions arguments in support of sprawl, I felt underwhelmed because they're just references to other papers; he doesn't present us with many numbers or analysis from these other papers. That being said, I agree with his basic premise --- that criticism to sprawl is overblown, and that most people prefer to own their own house and their own car. But I was looking for more solid arguments to support that, and this book did not provide them."
3,Sprawl?,"An interesting counterpoint to currently fashionable rhetoric condemning ""sprawl"" as a social and environmental evil. Bruegmann makes a number of good points, well-illustrated by graphs and charts, with appropriate footnotes and citations. Some of his arguments seem to stem more from an Libertarian philosophy and an excessive faith in the free market than a dispassionate review of the data. Even though I believe this is a somewhat flawed book, it is a good starting point for further discussion and research on this issue."
3,Good ball...look does not hold up,"The ball looks great and throws great. The problem is that the blue stripe rubs off after throwing for just a couple of days. This is not a scuff problem, but rubs off where the thumb contact the blue line when throwing. The look was part of the reason I bought it for my son. That look is not the same after just a few days."
4,Might have to watch it more...,I got this for my little nephew and niece. They have seen it a couple times and are not thrilled about it. They're only 1 1/2 years old so they might not know enough to enjoy it. They like Weesing Park though.
1,not so good,I bought this dvd for my grand kids .. and they are totally bored by it .. They love all of the other Wee Sing DVDs.....but not this one
1,Quantitative Chemical Analysis,It never came in the mail. If it were more than $5.00 I wouldve complained but I just bought it from the bookstore for $80 instead.
3,Radio Disney: Move It,"Some of my kids favorite dance songs, old & new, put together on one CD done in Disney style."
5,Monster Hunter Freedom 2 review,I bought this game because a buddy of mine played it all the time. and he got stuck so told me to get it and we can link our PSP's together and play as a team. Just like 2 player Co-op. Once we did that the game became even more fun.
4,Just Fine,I purchased this product as I have more tile floor space than I do carpet. It works wonderfully for both. I have no issues with spreading on the tile floor instead of picking up. It is heavy - I'm OK with that. The foot lever for changing level (1-7) tends to stick which is rather annoying. The brush on or off lever works fine.
1,Pick something more durable,"I ordered this Bissell model based on the reviews and good price. Unfortunately, the first one arrived with a crack in the plastic housing. I returned it for a replacement, and the new one's housing was cracked even worse. Very disappointing and time-wasting experience! I'm going to buy a different model - the plastic construction on this one is just too cheap and flimsy."
5,So glad I purchased this vacuum.....,"It took me along time to decide and I relied heavily on the reviews here on Amazon, but after going back and forth between this one a slightly cheaper one I went with this one.I am so pleased with it. Looks great, works great, totally awesome. Overall a good experience after I got over the shock and horror of what was being pulled from my carpets. It was absoultely shocking....and completely horrifying.I can't compare to anything other than the dinosaur I was using but while I know it is a little heavy and a little loud, neither bothered me. The ergonomic design alleviated the weight and I couldn't care less about it being loud.Great purchase...."
5,Finally....,a book that has all the answers to the questions I've had since moving to North Carolina. It covers a wide range of topics and has so much information - from the state's history to DMV regulations and everything in between. Wish I would have known about this book when I first moved here. I think it's a great book for anyone who is planning on moving to NC or is a newcomer to NC.
4,Exactly what I was looking for,"We just moved to NC and I wanted a book ""to get my feet wet"" this is exactly what I was looking for. Lots of misc facts and history. I felt like I had a better feeling for the place when I got here than I am sure I would have without."
3,Great read for someone relocating to NC,"Good intro to the state -- details relating to history and facts that are useful to the job hunter or the retiree. If you are planning on making this state ""home"" for a while, this is the book to help you make some decisions on where to live and where you'll want to visit. Bill Lee did a thorough job revealing the most useful and interesting information for the reader."
3,The Country Bears,"This why in Disneyland has no more Country Bears there. The movie didn't do so good. What's next? Disney going make the movie ""It's small world."" ""Spash MT."", etc."
1,Never want to see it again,"Not good, very bad, easy to beat, so bad ""blockbuster,"" flat out horrible movie to see. You waste your good movie time."
4,our 2 year old loves it,This movie has it's moments and is cute. My 2 year old LOVES it and watches it everyday before nap time. As far as kids movies go this is not unBEARable to watch.
1,WARNING:NEW JACK SWING ALERT!!!!.....(yet again-sigh),"Oh Junior-the VERY talented British R&B/funk artist that gave us ""Mama Used To Say"" and the superb 'Ji"" album back in '82 decides very stupidly to new jack up his 1990 'Stand Strong' CD.BAD move!Not only was the new jack curse hitting all 70's and 80's era funk and R&B acts hard but EVERYONE of them decided to start doing it too,and not very well.It was a bigger musical plague then disco was said to be and doesn't even hold up THAT well.This CD is no exception.So along with Ray Parker Jr.'s regretable 'I Love You Like You Are' and Kashif's insipid self titles 1989 CD this goes right into the same Guy/Bell Biv Devoe soundalike junkheap.Don't waste your time like I did-not even a penny!"
5,Adams Apple is a pie with many blackbirds and suprises,"A friend who had seen the movie at the Atlanta film festival raved about it so I looked it up and found it. I had to get a code free DVD player to see it but it was worth it. This movie will suprise you, amuse you, make you uncomfortable at times but it will make you question thing in life that you take for granted. How do you live with the bad things in your life? Do you let them get you down? This movie movie will take you on a ride and it has a supprising ending that is fantastic! This movie is not a ""Hollywood fluff"" movie at all, not even close to it, it is a fantastic movie that deals with life, morality, and love. Be sure to see this movie with friends and talk about it afterwards and get different viewpoints."
4,Adam and his Apples,"Some other reviews of this film included the description ""dark comedy"". While dealing with serious issues, there are some laughs along the way, but the overall theme of the story is not comedic.In a broad sense, this movie was somewhat predictable as it unfolded, but thankfully the specific character development has surprises. As is true in many great stories, everyone and everything is not as it first appears.I thoroughly enjoyed Adam's Apples, and would recommend it to anyone willing to read the subtitles (unless you know Danish?) and persevere through some of the uncomfortable scenes."
3,Unravelling D string,"Three of the four strings are fine, but the D string has already begun to unravel, which simply should not be the case. I think it should be replaced, because the string has been on my viola for less than a month."
5,"A very good antenna reading, elucidating and taboo breaking.","As wrote on the back cover: Before buying or build your beam antenna, take a moment to read this book. It will guide you away of the many myths and bad-pratices."
4,Kings of Kool,"Even if you don't have a chauffer, limousine and stacks of folding green you can place this CD in your player, slip off your mary janes and with a little gasoline take yourself back to the time when music was better than today's. This CD features studio tracks from the 3 core Rat Pack members FAS, Dag and Smokie. I personally didn't have any of these studio tracks so I found it to a real barn burner. So buy it and let's start the action!"
1,Not Much Choice,"If you're like me, you've noticed that there aren't too many helpful materials out there for anyone in Home Economics who is studying for the CSET. I found that this book, while dated 2004, was archaic and largely unedited. I found multiple spelling errors and typos throughout the book, some that made it difficult to understand. Over the rest of the book, I thought most of the information presented was very ""on-the-surface"", not too much depth. I'll leave you with a quote from the book that almost made me fall off my chair, from the section on effects on the family if both parents are working, ""There are a few obstacles for the wife. They are children. The wife always makes the childcare arrangements. More domestic responsibilities rest with the wife. Even if she has a full time career, she still does 90% of the housework."" I don't know about you, but my husband wouldn't get away with that!"
1,depressing....,"Victorian era Coventry Romance. Couldn't finish this one. The storyline was promising, the heroine was born ""on the wrong side of the sheets"". But the writing fell into the classic ""Cinderella"" complex-she was raised by her uncles's family and EVERYONE treats her like a doormat-from her family, to her fiancé who'd been stringing her along for FIVE years:( I quit about 80 pages in-just too much of a downer"
1,Smoke and Mirrors by ShopCloseouts - Dissed,"While the mouse I recieved is the model B100 listed for about $1 cheaper. Since the model is a cheaper model the return postal to get what I really wanted isn't worth it. ShopCloseouts is playing a switch and shuffle game on it's sales of this mouse. Although the B100 works fine, I have a distaste for dis-honest retailers who shouldn't be allowed to sell through an otherwise clean retailer Amazon. If you want a B100 model buy one and dont buy this model from ShopCloseouts, cuz you'll end up with a B100 from ShopCloseouts anyway."
4,Simple mouse,This is a simple replacement mouse that is comfortable and effective for my needs. I had two ergo mice that went in less than a year each but were a lot more expensive. We will see how long this one lasts but for the price it's good either way!
4,Mouse Review,What can I say? This is a mouse. It does a great job of doing what a mouse does.It is cheap and it works. Thanks.
3,"So far, so good","Bought this as a Christmas gift for my dad. He had an old ball mouse. So far it works fine. Mine at home is starting to act up, so if it continues to work, I will be purchasing another one of these."
5,Logitech Optical Mouse,I was well pleased with this product. It arrived on time and as advertised. I would recommend this product to anyone.
1,Bad quality and questionable compatibility with Macs,"I bought this mouse about 6 months ago and recently the right mouse button became stuck and doesn't click at all. Also, after switching the mouse on my Mac with this Logitech, I noticed it started to act buggy and upon googling the specific problems that were happening, all signs pointed to the mouse. I almost always buy Logitech mice and am usually very happy with them with the exception of this mouse. My advice is to purchase a more durable model especially if you will use it on a Mac."
5,Nice Optical mouse,I bought this mouse for my MSI Wind U100-439. It is sensitive and easy to use and the price is good. I am pleased.
2,Stopped working after 10 months,"I was aware of problems with logitech mice, but decided to go ahead and purchase one anyway because it was cheap. Mine started to double click on a single click after 10 months. Having had the same problem on an older Logitech mouse, I knew that this is a well-known issue with logitech mouses/mice."
4,great selection of music,I am a huge Mickey Gilley fan and this cd brought back memories of the 80's and The Urban Cowboy.
2,Not really impressed,I first came upon Joy Williams through a wow cd. I bought the cd by surpise and I loved it. So when this next cd came out I was there to buy it. I must say though I was really disappointed in this one. First of all the sing Hide reminds me way too much of Hilary Duff's Fly song. Not sure I like that idea. My second thing was in the last album her songs were more about God. This album didn't give me that. So this album was ok but I was very disappointed in it.
2,don't use the restaurant recommendations,The dictionary section was helpful but we unfortunately followed his suggestion and ate at Biffi in Milan. It was both the worst and most expensive meal I ever had in Italy. Frozen ravioli? Seriously?? The neighboring Gatto Rosso is much better with the same touristy experience inside the mall. I wonder how much this author toured outside of the typical tourist areas.
1,Poor Quality,This product arrived and within 5 minutes it fell apart. It was poorly made and the plastic quality is very flimsy. I would NOT recommend buying this product to anyone.
3,Short on Science,"This book is a nice quick read for those who want a simplistic history of the Salk vaccine and the America that gave birth to it.'Solution.."" is almost devoid of hard scientific explanations. The author never adequately explains why polio emerged as such a public health threat in the post-1850 West and, simliarly, he fails to set forth the means of transmissision.Put simply--pun intended--the book displays all the pluses and minuses of the author's journalistic background.For a really excellent book on an infectious disease written for a general audience try ""And the Band Played On"" about HIV/AIDS."
2,"Good characters, so-so plot","I bought this book at the gen con convention, and it was a quick read. Chris is a good author, who I hope will get better. However, I think I just expected too much after his last book. Unfortunately, this one had too many similarities to other Dragonlance books, and to other fantasy books on the market. Chris needs to come up with better ideas! I liked the character Dezra, though."
5,Very nice Product,"I used this product in cutting stained glass and found it to be easy to use and faster cutting. It will cut curves and different shapes with accuracy, shipping was quick and very affordable. I would recommend this product to pros and beginners alike."
4,product as listed,Product as listed and was sent in a timely fashion. I have used this type of glass cutter for many years and have had very good luck with it cutting stained glass.
4,Funny story,"This is a funny story about a couple who do a bike tour. The writing is not always the best, but it is a very human story."
5,Great Chili,The Best Chili There Is! It has a great taste and contains no meat which makes it even better to eat.
1,The product was wrong!,"The product was wrong, I buy a goniometer 6"" 180Dg X 5 Dg and arms of equal size and came from 3"" 150Dg diferent size of arms. I live in Venezuela!. I lost my purchase?"
5,This game is hella good.,"This game is alot of fun. The game came out in 94. And with guys like Frank Thomas, Mark Grace, Kirby Pucket, Jack McDowell, David Cone, & others having thier own unique batting and pitching stances. I played it w/ the Mariners, and I hit 51 hrs w/ Ken Griffy Jr. Try and beat that.There a bunch of ballparks like Fenway Park (w/ the green monster), wrigley field, and the skydome. (In wrigley & fenway, you can hit em out of the ballpark and smash some car windows.) It might not have A-Rod & Nomar, but it's got a bunch of hall of famers in thier prime like, McGwire, Gwynn, Mattingly, R. Henderson. I think it has Nolan Ryan too. It has the players that are really good now, just getting started. Like Pedro, Ramierez, Piazza, Sosa."
5,Great for Potty Training,"This product is awesome. I put it on top of the fitted sheet on my toddler's bed, who is learning to stay dry at night. It was so easy to just pull the pad off the bed and have dry sheets under it. It's only been ""put to the test"" once, but it worked great that one time and kept the sheets dry, which is great in the middle of the night when you don't want to change the whole bed."
5,Works well,We just switched my 2 year old to a twin bed and got this to protect the mattress. It's easy to put on and protects the mattress well.
3,Works but it's a Pain,"This is a great product for catching an accident but the design lacked complete thought. It is supposed to wrap around the mattress and tuck between it and the boxsprings. The problem is that there is nothing to keep it from coming back out. Everytime I get the bed made back up and get it wrapped and in place, then my daughter gets in her bed and rolls over a few times and the thing is pulled out and rolling up leaving places unprotected from an accident :-( I am going to try sewing elastic straps on one side and snaps on the other side of it so that I can secure it into place and then it will be great. (if I can figure out how to do that)"
5,Can this go in the dryer?,"Hi guys, I was told that these mattress soaker pads should not be put in the dryer. Is that true???"
4,Great for newly trained kids,"I am very satisfied with this pad. My son was having a lot of trouble getting through the night without Pull Ups. He wet the Pull Ups so heavily that I was afraid to ever try to take them off. Once I got this pad, we tried going without them. He wet the pad 5 nights in a row, but it never went through to the sheets. I bought two of these pads, so I could wash one and have a fresh one on the bed. I would recommend doing that.He nows sleeps through the night without wetting the bed, but I keep this pad on the bed for occasional accidents. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that it sometimes comes a bit loose during the night. However, it has never moved so much that an accident was not contained on the pad."
4,Works great!,"I ordered 3 of these for my 2 year old and 4 year old's beds. This has already saved me multiple times of having to wash sheets. If one has an accident in the middle of the night, I have another to throw on there. It does make the kids sleep a little sweatier I think, but they are already extremely hot sleepers anyhow. Pretty good overall product!"
4,Retrospective Look in the History of Benovolence of Affluent American Business Men and Women,"""This book has enriching information on the time-line on the African-American owned life insurance companies starting at story points on the benevolent purposes from the mid-19th century, to benevolent corruption in the early 20th century, real estate issues, scandals of the affluent, and historical biographies of these powerful early economic wealth builders. It also includes the most in-depth biographical information I have found on my great grandfather - Cassius M. White, a former educator out of Travis County Austin, Texas, who was recruited in 1900 to undertake the Supreme Commander role and become a principal figure in rebuilding the once floundering American Woodmen Life Assurance company camp in Denver, until his death in 1923. """
5,The best snes game ever!!!,"This is simply the best game on any system below at least the PS1. Although other reviews have done a great job at explaining the game unless you've played it you can never really understand how great it is. I check at least a few times a year in hopes that a sequel will be released for the PS2 which would fix the only possible problem I could see anyone having with the game, the graphics are not the best (SNES)"
5,Very nice,Great for slip-ons. Braces the pipes well while looking nice. I tried clamps after losing one slip on but they didn't look good so I tried these heat shields and it gave it a much better appearance. The exhaust pipes have a nice unique style to it. I don't believe you will be disappointed. Worth the price and glad somebody made these
4,"Not as good as the other two, but still an EXCELLENT Series","I have been waiting to get this book at a reasonable price and as soon as the paperback came out I snatched it up. The first two books in this series were amazing! This book came from a darker point of view. This book had less romance yet still written from a headstrong teenage girl's point of view, so it echoed a lot of feelings that were in the two other books in this series. This series seems to be all about Denying love until all hope is lost and the day is saved... then getting the love you always wanted. So it would have been nice to have a differant main plot, but this book was excellent in tying up the Sevenwaters trilogy. Overall if you read the other books then I can't imagine why you would even be debating reading this one, but if you are looking at this book for some reason with out reading the other two then I would not read this. I love this authors work (just from this series so far) and I can't wait to see more of it!"
3,Fantasy bordering on horror,"The last of a trilogy, this one was most gruesome. Even reading the background and explanation for the main characters slide into evil behavior - and knowing that many of the classic legends and fairy tales include unspeakable acts - it was still an overwhelming barage of terrible images at times. Add to that a supposed love since childhood of an 'pure and innocent' guy who forgives his evil sorceress girlfriend for everything anyway, and it's just a bit too over the top. Least satisfying of the series with a too pat ending."
5,wow,this book came to life as did the others of the sevenwaters trilogy. i cant even explain how good it was.
1,Large RC Battle Tank,"Didn't buy from here,but I have one.Love it went down and up stairs,in grass,shot well,untill I turned to much treds came off and tore no place to get replacemet parts,but it looks good on shelf. And you can get good batterys for it at Radio Shack,but use it first before you buy the batt.or you will be like me with two batt. with no place to use them.If anyone can find treds contact me through Amazon. Thank You"
1,Don't buy,"This tank looks really cool. You take it out of its box and charge the batteries. You get it all set up. At this point you are dying with excitement. After the batteries charge, you fire it up only to find out that it is soooooo painfully slow. The gun shoots air soft pellets but it looses its appeal within minutes. I regret buying this. So extremely disappointed. Save your money."
1,"Junk, junk, junk!","Just got the tool, first use and it broke. No good, very cheaply made. I should have realized because it was so cheap."
5,The best quality in any bible I've seen or touched....,"Never has any book felt so good in your hands as this finely crafted bible. Its a perfect bible for those who like to first read scripture without predjudice from notes, with just prayer and the Holy Spirit. (afterwards I look at commentaries, etc. and other study bibles) I have the navy cowhide version.. It feels like an old piece of leather that took years to feel so luxurious...and to top it off it has a lifetime warranty! The only thing I'd have perferred is one column as opposed to two but the paper quality and binding more than compensate for this. It really does open flat the 1st time!"
5,Job related,"This item was purchased to complete a series at my library. Whenever I am frustrated by missing books in series by favored authors at my local library, I depend on Amazon.com to fill in the gaps for my own as well as other library patrons where I work. The availability and prompt response to the requested item is very gratifying as well as the excellent condition of this product."
5,Poppy Done Deliver!,"""Poppy Done to Death"" is the 8th (and possibly last?) of Charlaine Harris's Aurora Teagarden mystery series. I loved this series and this book is just as fun a read as the other seven. Read them in order because there are many references to happenings from previous books."
2,Nice Mats BUT they don't fit!!!!!!!,"Bought for my 1999 Tahoe. Specified my vehicle and the item said it would fit BUT when I received them, they did not...really not even close. Seemed to be good quality but doesn't really matter if they don't fit. Amazon..you need to make sure your ""fit guide"" works! Big waste of time due to receiving the wrong information."
2,Go for the Senergy line,"It's bad that Princeton Digital (formerly known as Princeton Graphics) sells this ""value"" line of LCD monitors called the SL series, because their prices are often higher than the company's much better SENergy series. Do not buy an SL-series monitor; do check out Princeton's SENergy products."
3,Meh... its ok,"There seems to be an awful lot of hype surrounding this projector. After the initial ""WOW!"" factor its all down hill. Sure its a bargain, but unreliable and, in my experiance, cant take a beating. After just 1 month the fan started making this awful, high pitched, buzzing sound and the tech support, like all tech support, give you and ansewer that is 100% correct, yet absolutly usless. For the money, your better off with 32inch LCD TV or something."
2,Don't bother,"All the components of a good story, but this book falls flat. The writing is predictable , repetitive and has more than a few grammar errors. If I had turned this into my high school English teacher it would have earned a C grade."
3,Some Inconsistencies...,"I reread certain parts of the book to try to figure out if I had it wrong or not. I didn't. The ages of the characters just don't work. We know Jillian is 32. Martha tells Jillian that that Jillian's grandmother had her father first, and then 12 years later she had her 8 children all in a row. Then says Janie was born last. The problem is that Janie is close to 50 years old, while Martha's one son is 36 and her youngest daughter is younger that Jillian! It's little things like that in books that drive me crazy!Otherwise, it was a quick, predictable read. I love Folly Beach, and The Beach Trees 100x more than this book!"
2,Boring,"It is not often that I find a book boring, but this one particularly was... The setting in the South sounds gorgeous though, and the very end comes as quite a ""wow, didn't expect it to end this way"" that is pleasant, but appart from that, the story drags on for what seems like ever... Everything is so predictable, you just have to read the first 10 pages to figure out the whole romance thing.. In the end, it might be a good beach read but that's all. Took me forever to finish it!It was my first read by this author, but I'm not thinking of ordering another book by Karen White."
3,Need more pest control hunting info,"The book was just okay. It needed a lot more information for control of area pest hog hunting. Techniques for hunting hogs that only enter housing areas occasionally. In my area, the hogs appear one day and then maybe nine days later and sometimes not for three weeks. Info on their habits would be useful. Hog signs and wallows are not evident in housing areas. The hogs just visit every now and then. Info to hunt these type of hogs would be useful. I can't stay up all night for months hunting a hog in my development."
4,12 Men of Christmas,"Cute movie....the scenery was beautiful to look at, easy way to see Montana. Of course, Josh Hopkins and the rest were easy to look at."
4,Very convenient,My daughter gave this to my husband for Christmas and was happy to receive it as a gift as it will make it easier to grab things while in vehicle.
2,It's ok.,"This visor organizer is OK, for the price it's not bad. You can only fit sunglasses there if they're small and thin. It doesn't really stay tight, hangs a little bit."
3,Does not stay on the visor,The biggest complaint I have about this item is that is does not stay on the visor very well (2005 Chevy Impala). I also with there was another zippered pocket instead of the mesh. It does do the job and is pretty decent for the price I paid.
3,A very good Pasolini picture.,This movie captures very well the squalour of life in the Middle Ages and the mindset of Boccacio in writing the story. Pasolini effectively intersperses some effective erotic content.
2,Unnecessarily confusing,This movie cuts from one story to another without a break. It is very confusing. I liked the way it gave a taste of what it was like to live in that time period. A lot of the actors had bad teeth. That was very realistic.
3,Not as good as I expected,"Pasolini did a good job exploring the way people lived in the medieval Italy, but the drama was boring for me during most of the film."
4,Good Flash for the Money,I've used this flash on many occasions and have nothing but positive things to say about it. This flash is 1/2 the cost of a Canon flash unit and has a swivel head with a diffuser. I've used it in portraits and candid shots. The only thing is I wish it were a little lighter in weight.
1,Not worth it,"Did not get any positive effect, left my hair tangled up more than after using any other shampoo. Also tried the deeep protein mask, no improvement either. Would not recommend."
4,"IZ, IZ, IZ!","Since I am not from Hawaii I don't profess to identify with the political and cultural aspects of IZ's music, so all I can really say is that I find IZ's music just plain nice to listen to, especially when its just him and his uke. Need to relax, need to kick back and drift away to the Islands then this will do it for you. Get rid of the pills and pick up a dose of IZ to calm the tensions of the day. Of course you'll have to resist going out to purchase a one way ticket to Hawaii.....or will you?"
2,Not worth it,"I bought this textbook because it was required for a course, but I rarely read it. We had another text which was much better and focused on the same topics. Makes me wonder why the professor even had us buy/read this one. I sold it back as soon as I could because I'll never use it again. If you have to buy it though, expect short, dry chapters. It might be a quick read if you can stay awake."
2,"Serviceable, but nothing special","Northanger Abbey is my least favorite of all of Austen's books, so it's probably not surprising that I wasn't too intrigued by this adaptation of it. The actors are likable enough and capture the characters well--especially JJ Feild as Henry Tilney. But because the movie didn't establish enough Gothic atmosphere at Northanger Abbey, nor create enough mystery about the fate of Mrs. Tilney, it's hard to understand where Catherine's fancies come from. The whole movie seemed rather rushed and incomplete--but I see from another commenter that this DVD is a cut version of the TV drama, which probably explains it. Overall, I wasn't too impressed."
5,A Hard One to Capture,"I agree with all the critiques so far, but the executives at PBS/Masterpiece Classics should be horsewhipped for being so stupid as to think that Austen lovers would be content with 1 1/2 hour productions and convoluted changes. This adaptation is delightful with it's music, costumes, and choice of actors- I think I've fallen in love with J.J. Feild, but at times I also felt like I was on a run-away train. The pace is so fast that I shouldn't be surprised that the last 2 minutes left me shaking my head-that was our hero and heroine walking out of Church with their baby, right?? Who could tell with such a long, awkward shot across the grass. The ending was not well done.However, the adapters did try to capture the wit, irony, and tone of Austen's characters- not easy to make fun of Gothic novels when one is writing exactly that-a Gothic novel."
4,Good movie,"I have not read the book, but the friend with whom I watched the movie, has. She and I were both a little disturbed by the actual reading of some beyond risque excerpts from books in the movie. I would not recommend this for younger teens, though I tend to be more conservative in what I will allow my children to watch.Overall, I liked the movie, but it is not likely to be on my re-watch once a quarter list like other Austen movies I enjoy."
3,Disappointing Austen Rendition,I didn't mind the overall movie - however; it just cut off too abruptly. There really wasn't enough time to develop the love interest between the two main characters - the movie should have gone on for at least another 1/2 hour to an hour. It just became too disjointed for me. The audience gets the idea that the two will eventually get together. But it does not build up to that moment with the usual Austen suspense. I bought it because it finished my set.
4,Could've been better,I really enjoyed the story and was excited to watch the movie. The movie was cast very well and the leads were perfect. The reason I did not give the movie 5 starts was because the movie felt very rushed. I wish they had made the movie longer and developed all the characters and plots better. The cast was great and I wish I saw additional scenes that I read in the book.
5,Awesome,This is the second one I have bought. I didn't think it would look so sharp ... I just l just love it . I would recommend this to any Elvis fan.
5,Works great,"This is a bigger reflector than I realized, which is great because I want maximum visibility when I ride. It fits perfectly on my handlebar stem. I couldn't be happier with it."
3,As advertised. I should have paid better attention though.,"I made the mistake of not checking the details on this order. The reflector is 3"" round. For you average bicycle this is really big. Also the mounting bracket comes with no hardware to mount the bracket to the frame (where a hole is already drilled out for the old bracket I broke. The product is as advertised. I just didn't pay close attention to the details and only saw a bracket arm similar to the one I broke on my Raleigh mountain bike."
4,Tasty Olives,"Purchased as a gift to be tasted in comparison with similar olives from alternate manufacturers, this was the winner. Olives were a nice texture, the anchovy pieces were visible and the product delivered a pleasing result."
2,Where&#65533;s the angst,I love Uncle Tupelo I believe that Jay and Jeff would feed off each other and reel each other in. Maybe it was that they were younger and had more angst. In any case there are a few good cuts on this CD Damn Shame being the strongest. Overall it was a good attempt but maybe they have been leading too much of the good life and needs to find the fire and passion and the angst of years past.
2,Just Average.,"Well, after the first book of the Villains series. I had hoped that Mike Williams continue his streak of getting a little bit better... Unfortunately it was not met to be. This is the worst book in the series.. as opals are mentioned (again) but at a pathetic rate in this book and the adventure here is just not exciting and predictable... It's rather unfortunate since the Dark Queen is supposed to be the ultimate villain in Dragonlance. Not terrible... just not good. Average at best."
2,Boring; same old stuff from Michael Williams,"I didn't bother finishing it. I didn't care to read about more druidesses, black glain opals, and incorrect information. Williams mentioned a druidess in at least 2 of his Dragonlance short stories and ""The Oath and the Measure"". The opals were referred to in both of the Heroes Volumes' Weasal stories. I can't count how many pieces of ignorant and inconsistent information I came across"
1,Avoid this book as if it were a death knight!,"Easily, the worst Dragonlance book ever written. Boring, slow, clumsy, pointless, etc., etc. No offense, Mr Williams, but I could write a better book than this."
5,Read this funny book!,We recommend this book to everyone who likes to laugh. Junie B. Jones gets herself into many funny situations. This book is filled strong visual descriptions.-- Ms. Nickel's 3rd Grade Class
3,A good baseball game.,"Even though I got this game about 7 years ago, it is a decent baseball game. I never made it through an entire 162 game season because I didn't have that much time on my hands but the game never got boring to me. I really liked the home run derby in this game even though you only got to select from one of 6 characters which 4 of them were weak and probably not used anyways."
2,Disappointment from a great product,"These are not the chips I remembered. Not nearly hot enough as they used to be. Somewhat overcooked and over flavored with (sugar?) and maybe vinegar, actually drowning out what used to be a great chip. I called the manufacturer and they said basically, ""So sad"" ""Too bad"", hope you buy some more. They blamed their lack of ability to be concerned on the hurricane, which had not hit when these were made."
5,Second Arpeggio album with bonus tracks!,"This is a newer release of the ""Breakout"" album on CD incl. 3 bonus tracks by UNIDISC Records!5 stars for better quality & bonus tracks of the upgraded release to the first Hot Productions version of this album.Thank you UNIDISC... look for more!!!"
5,Better late than never ...,"It's hard to believe that such a superb album sat in a vault for nearly 25 years before finally seeing the light of day. Here is everything that was wonderful about progressive rock, without any of the bombast or empty pretension that saddled the worst examples of the genre. Built around the concept of a daylong train journey, the music is subtle & complex, melodic & jazzy, always transporting (pun intended). And the album concept itself can easily be read as allegorical, for the journey of life, or the journey towards enlightenment; yet this level of meaning is always understated, never heavy-handed. Michael, please give us more music like this! Highly recommended!"
4,Sweet story with charming illustrations,"This is a darling story and you don't know how things will turn out, so its a real page turner for the little child! The drawings are lovely! It was great fun, and a nice book to read over and over."
5,Super Nintendo NES System - Video Game Console,"Super impress with the shipment, very fast and it was everything it said it would be, I got it with a everything. A control, power and TV adapter, so the quality of the product and service over all excellent. Now I'm able to play my favorite games...."
1,poor,"unfortunately after having the console checked out by proffessionals, I found out that a small piece was missing from the output connection(ac adapter) which resulted in a poor connection and a poor picture. I will probably not order something like this online again because of the inability to try it first"
4,One of the Best Systems ever made,"The Super Nintendo Entertainment System is definitely the best system of its era. The SNES has great titles such as The Legend of Zelda: Link to the Past, Super Mario Brothers 3, Starwing, and Super Street Fighter II: Hyper Fighting. Other great and usually ignored titles include Zombies Ate My Neighbors, Aladdin, and Mickey's Magical Quest. Overall, the SNES is a great console and shipping was fairly swift."
2,the material is great...,"...but the sound quality leaves too much to be desired. I purchased based on the review above, but was disappointed. Go with the much better sound quality (and raucus behavior) on 'Hostage.'"
3,"British Humor is Ridiculous, but I Love It!","Sometimes, I just don't get British humor. My English relatives love the jokes of their countryman -- sometimes I simply don't get it. But, the jokes here are universal. There are many scenes which are made up of very embarrassing, but very funny, everyday scenarios. The story is about Travel bookstore ownder William Thacker, played by Hugh Grant, who lives in London, England's posh, expensive, and very high class Notting Hill district. One day, he meets and falls in love with lovely American actress Anna Scott, in one of the best scenes of the film. (It involves a cup of orange juice, apricots soaked in honey, and ""raisins"" -- remember that word for one of the film's BEST lines!And Richard Curtis knows how to write dialogue -- this man can think up some really funny one-liners! Some of the supporting characters were off-the-wall (but not written spaztically -- a good thing). If you enjoyed the movie, check it out. It's worth the cash."
3,All hail British humor,"""~This simple story about a travel bookstore owner and a famous actress is a romantic-comedy that's actually funny! appreciated with the written screenplay, which is where this hilarious movie formed from."
1,Flimsiest DVD on God & Physics Out There - WASTE,"I have seen numerous DVDs on quantum physics and research around thought, the universe and matter. This is the biggest waste of money out there. The host is annoying, the film is poorly edited and contains nothing but surface information - if you want good material, buy THE SECRET, Your Immortal Brain, What the Bleep Do We Know and many others. This one is a HUGE rip-off."
5,Another great CD from JDI!,Another great CD from JDI Records! And Dorinda Clark-Cole is spectacular on this CD delivering straight up church music like only she can! Michael Bereal does an outstanding job as the music director for the project - 5 stars!
4,What a debut!,"This has got to be one of the best debut albums any band has ever put out. No mega hits on this one, but a lot of raw, bluesy rock n'roll, highlighted by a tremendous blues number, ""Get Down Woman"". Why didn't they make more songs like this one? John Fogerty is backed up by the greatest rhythm section that rock n'roll has ever seen, and this debut album is better than most other bands' best sellers."
5,Excellent Overview of current and emerging technologies,This book is a great introduction to the latest technologies around. It is written for the non-technical manager and gives a solid grounding in what each area is about. I found the Wireless section particularly useful as I use this everyday in my job. There are 10 chapters and the Must Know section at the end of each. Worth the price in my opinion.
5,Great Cd,Tracklisting:1.Is It Just Me ? this track is just like the album version.2.S**t Ghost this track is only avalible on the cd and vinyl Excellent song to add.3.Shake (Like A Lettuce Leaf) great song reminders me of an ac/dc song.
4,Wonderful for the Price!,"I LOVE my chaise, it looks just like the picture (perhaps a little less yellow). It isn't super cushy to sit on, but it is very comfortable. The storage space is awesome and fits lots of stuff. It was fairly easy to put together, I did it by myself in about 30 minutes. Two the screw holes on the back of the bench part didn't line up with the holes in the arm rest, which was slightly annoying to deal with and I eventually just left them off, as the arm rest already had 4 other screws attaching it and was staying on fine with out them. Hopefully that won't come back to haunt me one day with the armrest falling off...Overall I love it, it looks super classy, well made and like it cost more than I paid for it."
5,Jim Brickman: Simple Things,"Jim Brickman is a FANTASTIC piano player. His ""Simple Things"" album is top quality, legendary Brickman piano playing. Amazon provided top quality service, too! Thanks."
4,Work of an 'Artist',Jim once again proves the artist he is. This CD has the mix of music we have come to expect from Jim. I sat through the whole CD and it's just so relaxing it cleared my mind from what's going around in this world. It's a great CD to add to your collection.
4,Great CD,"This is a great CD. Jim Brickman at his finest. Still, my favorite pianist/composer is Kostia. If you like Brickman, but also like to hear a pianist that offers a little more of the intrigue, mysterious sound to his music, check out Kostia's Ten Pebbles and St. Petersburg Suite cds. Listen and decide who you like better for yourself!"
5,This Truly is About Simple Things,"This long awaited cd is truly a return to the ""simple things"" in life, which is what Jim Brickman's music is all about. Just simple solo piano music with a few extras added for effect. This cd is reminiscent of his very first cd entitled ""No Words"" He receives help from multi-talented electric violin player, Tracy Silverman and his wife, Thea Suits, on flute, on the hauntingly beautiful ""Night Rain"" Not to be overlooked are the wonderful rich vocals of Rebecca Lynn Howard, on the title track ""Simple Things"", Tom Douglas, and All-4-One. Brickman fans will truly appreciate a return to the ""Simple Things"""
2,poor sound quality,I had the opportunity to listen to pieces of this CD before buying it used at a reduced price. The sound quality was so bad that I declined. This is basically a very poor quality bootleg.There are many live Gentle Giant CD's available and almost all of them have poor sound quality. I don't know why. We bought some bootleg Gentle Giant LP's in the seventies that had very good sound. Can't they find the sources of those recordings?
3,Somewhat disappointed,"This was purchased for a 4-yr old girl & was disappointing in that she was slightly entertained by the ""Cats Don't Dance"" DVD, but she didn't care for the ""Quest for Camelot"" one at all & suggested that we ""take it back!"" Ithink I could have made a better choice than this particular double DVD set."
4,How did it end? ***SPOILER ALERT***,"I really liked this book, except for the end. I understood early on that the anger and jealousy would end up being replayed in Kate, Greg, and Jon but I couldn't figure out which one of the guys would be Marcus or Nion.But, the ending really confused me. Is Kate now 'possessed' by Claudia or is she still Kate, in love with Jon? Is Jon now 'possessed' by Nion or is he still Jon, in love with Kate? Is Greg now 'possessed' by Marcus and will pursue Kate/Claudia and Jon/Nion? Or is the ending saying that he let go of Marcus out of his love for Kate?Very confusing. But, aside from that, I loved the book. Read the first half one night and stayed up until 2:00 AM the next night reading the last half. Could not put it down. Would have liked a lot more clarity for the ending though."
3,Her best book bar none,"This book gave me goosebumps! The storyline is compelling and the characters believable even in the unbelievable situations... you just believe it could be happening. I lent this book to my mum and got her hooked on Barbara Erskine as well. Can't wait for the follow up featuring Kate Kennedy - Daughters of Fire, which is due out in late 2005.Whilst you're waiting, if you want to read something similar, try MASTER OF THE SCROLLS by Benjamin Ford. Well worth a read!"
2,Poor quality.,"I bought these in the ""luggage"" color in a size 10. The leather was spotty; dark in areas like oil from a person's skin had stained it and lighter in other places. The leather was also frayed around the edges, as if someone cut the pieces with a dull pair of scissors. I don't know if the shoes are true to size b/c I didn't even bother to try them on. Its a shame, they are very cute shoes."
1,Bad copy from this seller - no help on a return,Bad copy - unusable - no help from seller. Don't buy from here!
3,It was hard to keep in my hair,"These rods were what was suggested to get a body wave in my hair but when I went to roll them up, they would not stay in. I ended up having to put a hair net on over them in order to keep them on my head. I have long hair so I didn't think this was a problem, but next time I will have to find a different set."
2,advertised as original classic LP reissued on cd,"I am an ex-DJ with many of these LPS in storage, plus I played many albums like this one on a professional level. This album may contain all of the same cuts, but not the lengths. JOHNNY JOHNNY PLEASE COME HOME is shortened here to an unremarkable length of just three minutes, where as original album was twice as long. This is not the exact album reissued on CD."
2,not enough room for accessories,"The case is good in that it fits my laptop. . .but there is ZERO room for the mouse, charger, or even a piece of paper for that matter. Well, maybe for a piece of paper, but that's it. The price was fair (on sale in the gold box) for what I got, though, or else it would be going back."
4,Laptop case,Would have gotten five stars if it were a little more roomy to hold the power adapter without having to force it into the available space.
3,good wax mop,I am pleased with this product. We have a great California Bungalow with original wood flooring.This makes it easier to wax your floors but I don't think I would want to buy the block every time I need a new wax applicator. You can buy just the applicator at local hardware store Ace Hardware usually has them.
5,As pictured and described,My grandchildren picked these skates out and they said they are just as expected. Purchased as a Christmas gift.
2,Very flimsy and cheap construction,"There's a tradeoff when it comes to things like kid's skates. They're not going to use them a whole lot before they outgrow them, so it's tempting to buy a cheaper product and move on before it falls apart. (The alternate approach would be to take the nicer item onto the used market when you're done with it.) These skates though are a bit too far into the cheap and junky territory. I wouldn't claim these to be unsafe out of the box, but the wheel assemblies are not very strong, and they do fail after a few hours of use..."
1,Not as advertised,This is not a Nintendo brand cable. It works but I don't appreciate the false advertisement. This is a cheap knockoff
5,Great,"Worked out great,works on my Super Nintendo and my Nintendo64 overall a great purchase recommend this product to anyone who wants to play old school games"
1,what a joke,"Came in a plastic bag. Looks like somebody cut and stripped an a/v wire, soldered it to an adapter, and threw it in a bag. Wires were bare and stripped and chunky, broken solder. Completely useless and unrepairable. What a scam and waste of money. I realize these are not manufactured anymore, but couldn't somebody do a slightly better job?"
3,On the fence...,"I bought a console (labelled Like New) for Christmas. I also bought this cable in case the previous one didn't work. The console doesn't work, and I'm pretty sure it's the console that's the problem, not the cable. Ah, well."
1,Poor design,"This clock-radio looked like a good idea, but after receiving it and setting it up, that idea quickly faded. First, there is no radio tuning knob, only a button that scans through the FM dial with no indication what the frequency is. Second, setting the clock is an exercise in non-intuitive design as the buttons are not labeled logically. Third, the switch to turn the radio on and off, the switch for alarm radio/alarm sound, and the switch to change Mater's phrases are all on the back of the clock-radio. Even with all these issues, I would have tolerated them (because my son did enjoy it), but ended up returning it because the time display was failing (some clock digit segments were disappearing)."
5,Travel through time save the world and become a legend.,"Excitement... Danger... The Warrior desires these not, but craves them non the less. If you like Final Fantasy or RPGs at all then you will love this game. Hard to find and expensive when you do, but well worth it. You play as a young guy named Chrono and travel through time to save the world. Changing events in the past effects events in the future which gives this game multiple endings and paths to explore, allowing for hours of game play. Not a game that you play once and put away for years, you will find yourself playing this game many times."
5,entertaining and practical,"There are dozens of books now available to give the novice information on how to be safe while practicing what our society calls ""kinky"". There are hundreds of fiction books that portray unrealistic relationships and a few dozen which show more the heart and soul of BDSM. But John Warren in one book does both. This book, ""Safe, Sane, Consensual and Fun"" is a great hybred of fiction and how-to. 14 stories show different orientations (primarily het) and different activities that people who do BDSM engage in. At the beginning we are given a list of the tools used in the story. As the story goes along, there are safety notes, suggestions, and info on how that scene is being done. Its a good way to start exploring and a good source to have your partner read before you try something out. Just remember that you aren't a fictional character and other things can come up during your scenes."
4,"How much content can be filled into one fine, entertaining game?","The last X title to be seen on a Nintendo system for almost 10 years, and also the last SNES titles. Like X2 and MM7 before it, this is one of the rarest games to find online, and in terms of 16-bitness, this is probably the most visually striking. The goods that come from this title include Silicon Graphics doing a great job with the 3D renderings in many of the bosses in the game, which were some of the most challenging and deadly, the increasingly challenging level structures, and the introduction of Zero as a playable character. Add on two big sub-bosses, four reusable Ride Armors, and those peskily hidden Heart Tanks, Sub-Tanks and Capsules, and you have a recipe for a potent, entertaining X title that ended up being better than X2 but still not reaching the stratospheric rise of X1. Despite its sticker price in this day and age, it's really worth it to get. Consider it the Holy Grail of the X series."
1,Cheap Plastic Toy,"It says right on the box that it is for ""FUN"" only that it is NOT a medical device. No science behind this. Tried it, no results. Then I tried the Stresseraser with great results. The Stresseraser is FDA approved. The emWave is not FDA approved and it has no clinical testing that shows it does any good. The Resperate is even better than this toy. Do not waste your money on something that doesn't work. Get the Stresseraser of Resperate instead."
2,Nothing but lights,"Having had some experience with professional biofeedback, I found the emWave to be nothing more than synchronizing my breathing to the lights.It did make me breathe deeper and slower but sometimes I tensed up just trying to make my inhalation/exhalation last as long as the light. I sent it back."
3,Probably Okay,Another stress relief gadget. Not the answer for me. Mine is back in the box and stored. I'm sure it might work for some people.
1,Free Shipping,"It said that there was a special discount on the item, which when clicking on said if you spent more than $100 on qualifying purchases I would receive free shipping but then when I entered the promotional code, it said no promotion was available so I ended up paying over $12 for shipping. It wouldn't have been as bad if they didn't tell me that I was going to get free shipping."
3,Oiling problems,"The cutter is easy to hold but a few of us in our stained glass class that purchased this model found that after some use the tip will not get oil. Removing the cutter head revealed a pump stem with a tiny wick that should get oil when pressed, that then transfers oil to the cutting wheel. The wick disintegrated so there's no contact with the wheel and it's not easily fixed as the wick is below a brass holding collar. We wind up having to dip the wheel in oil to do our cutting. Other reviews I have read indicated the wick dries out and takes quite a bit of priming to feed oil again."
1,Glass Clutter,The cutting tip can't be locked down. It twists and turns. A shame for such and expensive item.
2,Generally Low Marx,"The Marx Brothers in less-than-stellar form. Based on the hit Broadway play, ""Room Service"" (1938) was the only film not written specifically for the team. The result is an awkward fit, but there are a few priceless moments within the situation-comedy framework. Regrettably, the harp and piano solos have been jettisoned while Margaret Dumont's presence is sorely missed. ""Room Service"" should be viewed as a well-intentioned, yet unsuccessful experiment. Sadly, ""At the Circus"" (1939) ranks as the Marxes' worst film. Groucho, Harpo and Chico are brought down by weak material, an obvious lack of enthusiasm, and Kenny Baker's annoying presence. Strictly for completists."
5,woohoo,"now i can finally play two player games on my snes! always worried about getting a knockoff brand when I find a cheap retro gaming accessory but this is the legitimate real deal nintendo brand controller. All the buttons work perfectly and the cord is flawless. fast shipping, great quality. thanks a bunch"
1,no good,the controller didn't work. I was given a refund but it cost me more to send it back than it was worth. I would have rathered the controller be replaced with another that worked.
3,3rd Party Super Nintendo Controller,This is a great look alike controller. The only thing that I really don't like is the fact that the cord is way shorter then the original for the super nintendo.
1,I KNEW AS SOON AS I OPENED THE BOX,"Mannnn.... I've been had!!! I was trying to replace the crappy controllers that come with the FC TWIN... only to find out, these aren't any better!!! I could tell as soon as I looked at the controller it was a cheap ripoff! AND I HAVEN'T HELD ONE OF THESE IN 10+ YEARS!!!! The plastic looks different... it just looks different! And yes, just like others mentioned, when I plugged it in I thought to myself (wasn't this cord longer?!) because that was a complaint about the FC TWIN Cords among them just sucking in general..... MAN, I bought TWO of these peices of crap! Now I have 4 bad controllers! LOL...Now, I gotta go find a REAL one for like 30 dollars... YIPPPPIEEEE.... Get this controller if you want, 2 bucks is a good deal, but THIS ISN'T AN REAL SUPER NINTENDO CONTROLLER!!!! Just a knockoff/lookalike."
1,This is not an official Nintendo controller,"You will see these on ebay and other websites advertised as new in box original Nintendo brand SNES controllers; this is not true. These are fakes made in China with poor quality plastics and an extremely short cord. These controllers work for the most part but the buttons are extremely hard to press, the cord is, as I said, very short, and the buttons don't always do what you tell them to. One example of these controllers that I own always wants to go down, even when you're not pressing anything. If you want a replacement controller for your SNES look for a used original, it will serve you better."
5,The real thing is rock solid.,"Nintendo's first party gear is usually high quality stuff, and their SNES controllers are no exception. Although years of use and abuse has shown that they aren't as bulletproof as a Genesis controller, they're still the one and only gamepad you'll ever need for your Super Nintendo experience.I've tried using other controllers, and unless you need a Turbo or Rapid-Fire switch, this is what you need."
2,"This is a good looking boot, but the comfort falls short","This is a good looking boot, but the comfort falls well short of what I expected. I will be wearing socks with these. The sole is very hard(not much cushion) and there is not much of the sheepskin lining in the toe of the boot. I can't imagine doing alot of walking in these. The leather is in very good shape and the stitching seems to be well done. It's probably worth the $32 price for the boot, as long as your not looking for the comfort of Uggs or a good Ugg knockoff. Time will tell."
4,"A classic disco album, however be aware ...","This is one of the better complete albums of the disco era and Souveniers is ne of the all time great disco songs. However... if anybody out there (like me) owned the original album you know that the songs on Side 1 blended from one to the next. On the CD version, there are breaks between each song unfortunately, and this somehow manages to slightly throw off the complete mood of the original side.This is a minor thing though and yyet this does remain a classic disco album. Get this one now before you are not able to anymore; it is starting to look like this is going to become out of print!"
1,a review from someone who actually lives in victoria (where this book is set),"just a few facts about this book- from someone who knows, i live in victoria and know the priest from the book. michelle is a real person-but she is crazy and the doctor just wanted to make money off a book. this is what the priest from the book told me anyway. although if you are from victoria and reading this book it is kinda creepy when they talk about thetis lake, the malahat, rossbay cemetery, and the secret tunnels under victoria, well not so secret, all victorians know they're there!"
1,Dangerous,"Michelle Smith & Dr. Lawrence Pazder Michelle Remembers (1980). This is the first and probably the most important of the Satanic Ritual Abuse (SRA) books. It allegedly documents horrendous abuse suffered by Michelle at the hands of a Satanic cult. This single book gave a kick start to the entire SRA movement in the early 1980's. The Wiccan Information Network and other groups have found that much of the book content was derived from Dr. Pazder's personal studies of African native rituals, rather than from Michelle's memories. When the accuracy of his book was questioned during a seminar, Dr. Pazder stated that he and Michelle had never claimed that the events in the book actually happened! He is now promoting ""Sadistic Ritual Abuse"" as the new definition of SRA. He believes that the Satanic conspiracy does not exist. He believes that recovered memories of SRA during childhood are often based on real memories of incest to which a false overlay of Satanic ri! tual has been added."
1,"What is wrong with you, people?","What is wrong with you, people?Do you even consider to take this BS seriously? It is all about money.Knowing that so many stupid folks around they're cashing in on SRA.I know Michelle and Larry personally. They are a couple shysters....reach ones...thanks to you, readers.When you read this garbage, think about children who have been taken away from their parents by social workers in UK, wrongfully accused people sitting in jail, millions of tax payer money wasted on police investigations, medical research and so on. This book created panic and paranoia. Very poor written book, by the way.There are so many material you can find about this book, search the web.But if you are really into this stuff ( Satan, magic etc) read something which worth it...Goethe, Dostoevsky, Dante, Bulgakov, PoeTake care, John"
1,A WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY!!!!,"My 6 yr old was so happy to get this toy, but when I got it home, and put water in the bottom part to give it weight, the water leaked, no matter how tight you turned the cap. After using sand in place of water, I blew up the bop bag, but the air only lasted about 5 mns, it leaked badly. I plan on finding the manufacturer of this item and giving them heck about it. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!"
1,Antiquated,"This book is from the turn of the 20th century. It is antiquated and irrelevant, except for those interested in the history of hypnosis. If you want a historical relic, this book is for you. If you want to learn modern hypnosis, don't bother."
2,I don't usually agree with the critics but...,"Just watched this movie and saddly that is 2 hours of my life I will never get back again.I really enjoy Jackie Chan as an actor, but I have NO idea why he elected to act in this movie.This movie attempts the recent sucess of remaking classic movies into 'modern-day' tales and capatilazing on people wanting to watch their favorite actors.This movie is tedious and often blunders through guest appearances and trys to forcefeed the plot line down our throats.If you are looking for a couple light laughs that will fill two hours... find it somewhere else..."
1,Jackie Chan left a floater!!!,"This is one of the worst debacles ever wroght on mankind. Some might even call this borderline abuse! The only way this could have been worse is if they added Jm J Bullock, Kathy Lee Gifford, Charles Nelson Reilly and Paul Lynde to this cast. Whatever you do STAY AWAY FROM THIS STEAMER!!!!"
1,Waiting to Laugh,"Jackie's martial arts antics remain admirable, but you can enjoy those and still laugh in his ""Shanghi"" movies. He's fun to watch, but he also falls prey to so many movies that just aren't funny-and this is one of them. The dialog stinks, the jokes fall way short, and the slap stick bites, to put it mildly. In this manner, it does strongly resemble the original, but when the movie itself is so bad, star cameos cannot save it. Do not waste your money or your time. What a waste, for an otherwise lovable guy."
3,Around the World in 80 Days,"This was a remake on the one with David Niven that was great. I was a little disappointed in this one though. Jackie Chan is not the lead character but a side character. There is a lot of comedic things to laugh at, but the picture doesn't quite come up to par."
4,Jackie Chan redeems his string of bad US movies,"I saw a premier for this movie, and I have to say it was much better than I thought it would be. The action was pretty good, considering that it was rated PG, and the humor wasn't stupid. Compared to a lot of other kid's movies these days, ""80 Days"" is great. There is a little too much hit in the groin humor (though it is done more subtly than most films), and having a rendition of ""It's a Small World After All"" near the end of the credits wasn't a very good idea, but this is probably Jackie's best movie since ""Shanghai Noon"" (Chinese films included). Plus, the 10 on 30 fight in the Chinese village is one of the best fight scenes Jackie has done since the Ken Lo one-on-one fight in Drunken Master II. A must-see (at least rent it)."
2,Disappointing,"I usually enjoy Jackie Chan's movies and I like Jules Verne, so you'd think I would enjoy the combination.Unfortunately the movie had little resemblance to the book and wasn't very funny.I was also offended at the way it went out of it's way to portray one of the giants of science as a petty, ignorant elitist. Lord Kelvin was famous for supporting scientific research and encouraging many other famous scientists. He was in fact not born into the aristocracy but knighted in recognition of his achievements.Beyond that I was disappointed that it didn't include the many and varied modes of transport and constant push to beat the clock I seem to remember from an earlier version (although I can't remember which one).It annoys me that people like Disney rewrite these things and keep the same name. It's not that I object to the rewrite (although it was pretty poor in this case). But why pretend it's the same story?I was very disappointed."
3,Better than it looks,ATWI80D is a fun movie. It's has some funny scenes (the women in Paris who thinks Partpartout has her bag) Chan has some great moves. Arnold is awkward in a role of a prince.
1,...Only because zero stars is not an option,"This is worst movie i have ever seen. NO talent was exhibited-the acting blew, the script was horrendous, the ""humour"" was not humorous, and it contained about every racial cliche in the book. top that with a predictable forced romance, ridiculously bad accents, and a scene in china that has abosolutly nothing to do with the story. i would not want to own this movie even if it was being given away free, which it will probably end up being, because it sucks. the only reason i saw it was because i was on an airplane and incredibly bored....although i regret it now and i would have been happier threading my hair into a loom and ripping it out of my skull as i weave a blanket for mutant, orphaned, third-world llamas."
5,PERFECT REALIZATION....,"Great film with a perfect realization, making a real feeling of what happened in that sad temptative to Eiger north face.Perfection also is reached by the actors and actresses who make their characters so plenty of humanity, that no one who watches the film can avoid to feel courage, fear, love....And perfection is the result fr the specialists who had to enter in the same situations where the original alpinists where, giving so realistic images, that leave almost nothing to the imagination.My congratulations to the team, and its Director, that have turned a so good-for-learning situation in a film plenty of feelings and thriller.And, as alpinist, my deeper admiration for the men who fighted those days against one of the harder hell ever found in earth."
4,North Face,Very entertaining film. The exciting shots on the mountain were spectacular. If you like suspense and action you'll like this movie. Recommend this film to anyone who enjoys WWII era themed movies.
3,One hit not mentioned in any review.....,"Steve co-wrote with Greg Allman what is probably one of the most well known and best Allman Brothers songs ever - ""Melissa"", which appeared on the Eat A Peach album. He also wrote ""God Rest His Soul"", about Martin Luther King's assasination, which was recorded by Greg and Duane Allman before they formed the Allman Brothers Band. Originally pretty hard to find, the song was released on the Allmans box set, ""Dreams"", and is well worth checking out. An excellent song and perfect vehicle for Greg Allmans soulful voice. Steve may not have charted very high, but he did write some very fine tunes."
3,A great songwriter too.....,"Steve co-wrote with Greg Allman what is probably one of the most well known and best Allman Brothers songs ever - ""Melissa"", which appeared on the Eat A Peach album. He also wrote ""God Rest His Soul"", about Martin Luther King's assasination, which was recorded by Greg and Duane Allman before they formed the Allman Brothers Band. Originally pretty hard to find, the song was released on the Allmans box set, ""Dreams"", and is well worth checking out. An excellent song and perfect vehicle for Greg Allman's soulful voice. Steve may not have charted very high, but he did write some very fine tunes."
4,Welch Revival,This is an informative video. It could be a little more exciting the way it was presented.
2,a good game gone bad,"ok, as one of the first people to buy the PC version, MW2, at the price of 80 dollars when it first came out, i was excited to buy the snes version as well. in the pc, you choose how your mech is built with more details than you would even like to know. on snes, you get to pick 3 wepons, that's it. you can't choose you missions, you cant fly, its overhead view, so you cant see where you are going, no lancemates. i would have rated it 2 or 3 stars out of five, but it gets so boring so fast, that i would rathar say its only one star. this is the second time that activision has taken a mech game to the game console and botched it up big time."
2,Not recommended,"We purchased this set from Sam's club in 2002. Hardly used until recently. It is broken after only 5 months of active use. Pictures and sound are good. However, I found out it breaks easily, difficult to find parts."
4,NAS bible,"Print size is great, but it is lacking in cross references to other Bible passages. Still, I like this version. The NAS is the most literal translation from the Hebrew and Greek."
1,"A must not read, in my opinion","For anyone whoever doubted that Brent Bozell is conservative and has a political agenda, this book is a must read. For anybody else, it's more of a must-not-read, a waste of time. It's like Rush Limbaugh without the wit, Ann Coulter without the legs, and William Buckley without the education. Muckraking should at least be fun."
4,Slightly formulaic....but who cares?,"Your arhcetypical new wave album. Whether the ""band"" ever had their own sound is debateable, but producers and remix jockeys went to town on the final production. Heavily remastered, over-dubbed etc. Bobby Orlando at his best.That being said, this album was low profile enough that it still has some rough edges that make it interesting. Lots of synthesizer hooks, etc.It is another example in a long line of music that proves that CREATIVITY goes a lot further than MONEY can in producing something interesting."
4,Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrl Power a la 1982,"How cool were they? Just listen to Passion, sadly the extended dance version isn't on here. But the version in here will do. Then also check out Jukebox and We Just Want to Dance. Great girl group who never made it any bigger than this! But with Felix da Housecat mixing in Passion's musical bridge from the 12 inch version is a testament to their lasting appeal."
1,Worst handling of an anime release ever.,"If you watched this show on Cartoon Network and are buying this DVD just to relive the Cartoon Network experience then this is for you. If you are a hardcore anime collector and are looking to see this show in it's orginal Japanese turn as far away from this as possible. The subtitle track for the Japanese language is in fact just a hearing impared track for the dub of the show. So not only does it have things like (laughing) or (yelling) in the subs but sometimes there will be subtitles when no one is even talking because they added voices in the dub that wern't there in the original Japanese audio. The ""dubtitles"" also fly by at such a fast rate that you can't even read how incorrect they are most of the time. On top of several other technical issues I can't recommend this release to anyone. Flat out terrible. It's a shame to because the show underneath it is actually really good. It just suffers from an absolutly horrible presentation."
3,More about other characters than Dredd at times,"This novel is set outside of the Big Meg (Mega City 1 that is) and has a good story line which builds upon the aftermath of the Judge Child and Warchild aftermath. The novel portrays Dredd exactly as he should be....to the BLUNT point and no non sense, a true man of action. The major downside is that almost half of the novel is about a mutant sea captain that seems almost as if she is the major protagonist and Dredd plays a supporting role to her. I suppose the way the story was written would have made more sense if it had been told from her perspective as a run in with Dredd. Not the best of the Dredd novels but if you love Judge Dredd, it is worth checking out."
4,Super Reader,"Weather Control is out. The Judges are stretched as some alien residents are in temporary housing while new quarters are being built.Dredd is running on empty when he is assigned to the alien sector and Sector Chief Caine. This Caine has a similar temperament and personality to Admiral Caine, from Battlestar Galactica, if you are familiar with that character.Not helping the situation are a couple of xenophobic Judges on Caine's team, and past history between one of them and another.Dredd and Caine don't get along, and the situation deteriorates.Judges die, plots are revealed and it seems Chief Judge Hershey had a plan all along."
5,POWER YOGA 101,"Baron is one of my most favorite yoga teachers-him and Bryan Kest when I'm a more ""hard core"" practice. This is a great tape for novices or more seasoned practioners looking a ""lighter"" practice. Broken into four sections-Water, sun salutes from modified to full to warm you up; Fire, standing poses and lunges (it lives up to it's name your muscles will burn!); Earth, balancing poses and ""core"" poses to ground you; and Wind, final stretches and breathing exercises (hence the name:). I've had this tape well over a year and I use often, when I want to do power yoga but perhaps not head on. Baron is an amazing teacher who exudes a calm you want to achieve. Buy it you'll love it!"
4,Good Elliptical,"This is a big unit so don't expect to put this in a small corner. I have used this about 3 months and I am very pleased. It is very smooth and easy to use. The directions could have been better, but that is not big deal. My unit was refurbished so it came completely assembled. This was nice except it complicated getting the unit up the steps (clearance issues). Now, if it could only do the exercise without me."
2,Below Average,"A labor of craftmanship and skill, but there is no genius in sight. Frank Black has proven to be able to do much better than this - especially with the Pixies. All songs sound good but they all lack a certain something: when I listen through the whole album nothing happens, not a single passage makes me stand up and take notice.The potential is still there, the magic is not."
5,A must for any visitor or new resident on a budget.,"If ever there was a city where it pays to be cheap, it'd be in New York, one of the most expensive cities in the world - and from a native New Yorker comes a book which packs in over a thousand listings of free opportunities to be found there, from wine tastings and music to dance, games and fitness. From small clubs and select, limited events to low-rent, no-fee apartments, THE CHEAP BASTARD'S GUIDE TO NEW YORK CITY is a must for any visitor or new resident on a budget.Diane C. DonovanCalifornia Bookwatch"
5,The Best Things in Life are (how to get stuff) FREE!,"As a New Yorker and an X-treme bargin hound I thought there would be little I could learn from this book. Wow. Was I in for a shock. The author reveals a universe of cheap wonders in NYC, that had somehow eluded my cheap self. Even better, it's a throughly entertaining read.I especially liked the entertainment listings and the hair, beauty and massage section. I'm all a twitter to go to the totally free Shiseido ""store"" for my free facial, massage and even classes. Heck, I may even apply for the free car he speaks of...The best kept NY secrets are here. Read this book and you'll finally understand how many of us can afford our rent AND have a blast every day of the week."
5,Great customer service,"When I first got my pad, I quickly realized the up arrow didn't work as intended, and after leaving my review of the pad, their customer service called me and took the time to find out what was wrong, and actually sent me another pad free of charge. The second pad works much better. I am extremely pleased with the way they handled the situation."
5,Annie and Tom are great together!,"Cindy Dees, if her first book is any indication, will become a household name where military romances rule. This was a fast paced book that screams for sequels.I loved Annie and Tom and Tom's team was worthy of getting to know better. Cindy takes us inside this military operation and inside a chopper without leaving us behind with technical talk.The black moment had me riveted with my heart in my throat.I'll put this book on my keeper shelf and put Cindy Dees on my auto buy."
3,Toothpaste,I really do love my sonic toothbrush and I like being able to put the toothpaste pouches in the sonic holder.As far as the toothpaste goes. I hate the cool mint flavor and wish crest would make the fresh mint flavor again.All that being said I received this product with quick delivery.Thank you!
4,high def standard,"Just like the cover says,1080p,blueray Hd qaulity.. This disk has a great picture,The reefs chosen are not the most exciting but seve their purpose as a background. Worth it for the price indeed."
3,Nothing Fishy,"Its good--not great, but good. I mean, it is a tank after all, not the Great Barrier Reef. The music is slightly mind numbing, maybe the fish enjoy it. I'm not sorry I bought it. I just think my expectations were a little too high. Don't be turned off by me. The fish are pretty and it is really relaxing and there are several tanks to choose from. The one tank does seem to have too much caffine in the water--I mean those fish are really bookin'."
4,Nice table,"Very satisfied with this table. Sure are a lot of pieces to put together. However, it was very easy to assemble. Would buy again"
5,Opened up the powerful world of black feminist thought to me,"This book helped me to expand my knowledge and my appreciation for black feminist thought, especially for black, lesbian, radical feminist thought. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to figure out how to reconcile their fight against racism with their battles against sexism and homophobia, within their own communities. Fifteen and twenty years ago, these women were already finding answers...so we can too!"
2,a LAS VEGAS SHOW1!,"I have all of the concert dvd's. This is one that I would not recommed.THE VOCALS WERE NOT UP TO PAR.tHis is a LAS VGAS SHOW, A LOT OF GLITTER & GLAM. WHERE WERE THE REAL ""GIRLS ALOUD""? I felt that this concert was a ""GOODBYE"" from the group, to go out with a BIG BANG ,THEY PUT ON THIS TYPE OF SHOW. BEST TO BUY THEIR GREATEST HITS TOUR ! Very Diapointed."
1,Customer Service is terrible,"The item I received looked nothing like the picture. The threading was horrible, I couldnt even make out the design it was so bad. I returned the item within a week of purchase and e-mailed the seller. That was almost 3 weeks ago and I still have not received my refund. I will never order from this company again"
2,a gamers review,i am a very critical person but when it comes to disney games i do my best to avoid them but this disney game was really creepy my friend brought it over one time and let me tell you its really bad i recommend goof troop to a disney fan
5,Hidden facts,"Did you know that there are chambers in the bottom of many temples that are still 'uncharted""? Neither did I. This is a great book."
5,A wonderfully illustrated book,"The illustrations of tomb construction in this book are excellent, as are the color and black-and-white photographs of found objects and the wall paintings. The detailed maps and the clear writing help the reader understand how archaeologists have worked in the Valley. It makes an excellent companion to the wonderful Elizabeth Peters mystery series featuring Amelia Peabody and her archaeologist husband Emerson--it even includes photographs of M. Maspero and Howard Carter, both of whom appear as characters in Peters' books. If you're interested in Egypt, add this book to your library!"
3,Rental,"I rented this book to have for a class. It arrived a little worn.But my biggest concern is I can not find the paperwork to return the book before my rental due date is up.Would be nice to have an email reminder of when the item is due back, and where to send it back.I would not recommend renting the book. Purchasing it would be easier.If I don't get the book return in time I will not only pay the rental price, I will be paying the purchase price as well."
4,"Awesome anime so far, but where are the rest of the episodes?","I'm really enjoying this anime, character development is well paced and it has a great balance of heavy and lighthearted moments. I'm giving this series a 4/5 based on the first 7 episodes, but I don't know how it will end, seeing that there are a total of 12 episodes in the series, but only 7 available here. where are the rest?!as the previous reviewer stated, this is Subbed and in its original Japanese language, however this is what I prefer. I still agree that this should be posted clearly, and for that matter it should be stated for all films! I can't stand most English dubbing, so it drives me nuts when an anime that I've been wanting to watch pops up on amazon, and it's in English.but seriously, where are the rest of the episodes? you can't leave me hanging like that; it's like only putting up half of a movie...Dream Eater Merry: Complete Collection [Blu-ray]"
3,dream eater merry,this anime is in japanese with english sub titles.I did not know this when I made the purchase.There is no information letting you know that this is only subbed
3,Fairy tales,"I like this classic tale and the message it brings. The illustrations were muted, and a few were scary. If the pictures were different I would like this version better."
4,Under Cabinet Stemward,"Our daughter and son-in-law made an older armoire that housed their TV and media components, into a ""bar""; and these fit perfectly inside; we hurriedly got a second one when we saw that they had room to put another one up. Perfect!!"
5,Hidden Treasure,Great product. My stemware looks beautiful and it really gives elegance to my kitchen. Now I have more counter-space. I love it!!
3,need more length!!,"I don't remember reading specific dimensions before I bought this product, I don't think the info was available. It could be at least 5 more inches in length, to hang at least 2 more glasses would be better."
1,What A Joke!!,"Do not waste your money. The lecture is boring and the one photo(slide) of the hole at the pole that the audience gasps at, Crenshaw doesn't show!?!? The rest of the dvd(s) is worthless info about the polar regeions of the earth.Worthless production both in quality and content. I wish I could give this -4 stars.One good point is it gives good hints at other research material."
5,The Ultimate Lingo reference,From beginner to expert this book contains all of the answers to your lingo needs. It is packed with examples and thorough descriptions.I can't find an updated version of it - if anyone knows of one please let me know!...
5,If you programming in Lingo...,...your life will be easier if this book is within reach. I even take it with when I have to go on-site to a client. Very useful having the Lingo grouped by subject. Also very useful icons by each Lingo word showing if it can be used in Shockwave and which versions of Director it can be used in. A must-have for a Lingo programmer.
4,A useful but short reference to Airliners,This book is very useful for those who want to identify planes. It is a good size so you can take it along whenever on a trip or when just passing by the airport. It has a good amount of info on each plane but does lack a cut-out drawing which comes in handy for those wondering about the insides of planes. This is a great reference for those who want to identify planes or those who just want to research commercial aircraft. It works well with the Vital Guide to the Major Airlines of the World also.
3,This movie was a let down,The acting wasn't that great from any of the actors. The plot was pretty generic and over done. Over all I only watched it because Miley Cyrus was in it.
1,not worth the money at ALL,"Me and my sister are both in our teenage years and decided to buy this movie. We totally overestimated this movie. First of all, according to the summary, the movie seems like one of those hilarious movies that shows a teenage trying to get along with her mom. We both predicted that there was going to be some kind of good moral in the end, but most of the part is just talking about a highschooler with a bunch of love issues that she goes through. Her mom is just this single mom who later on dates a guy that gives her a ride home. The only part that matched the summary was when Lola said that she knows her mom will always be by her side. Second, the price is wayyyyyyyyyyy to expensive! If you want to take the risk of watching this video, just please consider looking at the price... (like FOUR DOLLARS after tax for renting only TWENTY FOUR HOURS)!!!I'm sorry if I spoiled everything for you, but this is NOT the right choice of movie for the family."
1,Weak story line and a total waste of time.,Miley Cyrus was much better as a child-star. My whole family (including 2 teenage girls) thought it was terrible. I'm not sure of any age group who would find this film entertaining.
3,Cute movie,Enjoy watching Miley Cyrus and Demi Moore. The movie had some funny lines. Glad I rented it. Why do I have to write 19 words?
3,Not bad cute movie,The movie was cute.. I love cute love story movies. Miley Cyrus and Demi were a good team. I want to see more with the two of them!
1,lol,Item still has not arrived! (What more do you want me to say so that this message can be transmitted?)
1,Miley *hurk*,"Thank Satan for the Torrents because this craptastic mess is a total rip off. As I've long suspected Miley had only one thing going for her, the fact that she was jailbait. Now that she's legal there is nothing there but a bland,one dimensional mockery of talent."
5,LOL,"The movie is an AWESOME one for a Mother & Daughter to share about the ups/downs of growing up....LOVE,LOVE,LOVE IT....watched with daughter & granddaughter....such a bonding experience! :-)"
3,LOL= Lots Of Love?,"This movie was pretty good. I might watch it again, however, not a third time nor would I have paid movie theater rates to see it. I rented it for my 14 yr old daughter and I to watch... I like Demi and Miley, and the boys were cute. PS..... LOL does NOT= Lots Of Love so PLEASE don't use this term when sending condolences. :)"
3,movie,This movie was funny. It was fun to watch with my teenage daughter. I was always a Demi Moore fan and she was fantastic.
2,"LOL! When you finish watching it, you want to blow your brains out!","This movie isn't that good because it just seems like a bunch of teen issues/problems throwing into the movie. For example, you get to hear about BF/GF problems. You get to see silly little trust issues. You get to see bad grades issues. Teen crushes on teacher. Their even teen sex. So, everything and anything you can think of for teens, you'll get to see.I have been there and I know what happens at the end. I get over it and move on with my life. It's not the end of the world, and I can continue living. Yay.But....after watching this maybe I should blow my brains out!!!Seriouly, unless your a teenager with no other things to do, but waste time and money! You won't like this."
3,Product pitured is great but not what I received,"I love the Nivea for Men Face Cleansing Face Wash, Extra Gentle for Sensitive Skin, however, despite being what I ordered, it is not what I received. I received the regular version in a white tube. It is not the ""extra gentle"" in a transparent tube. Disappointed."
3,the real heaven&earth,"this is not the 1st album the 1st album was titled heaven & earth this is the album i want some tracks: dance a thon ,how do think your gonna fall in love,ihis album avilable plaese let me know thank you."
2,"LOOKING,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,",I also am looking for the first group called heaven&earthwith the kind of songs you can hold someone close all night too!!
2,Not up to Weems & Plath standards,"We have one on our boat. We've cruised with if for three years from 11 deg North latitude to 45 North, USA and Caribbean. It has held up well, but the barometer does not hold its calibration, so it needs frequent adjustment. We can't really trust it. The thermometer reads 20 F degrees high and can't be adjusted. Going to replace it."
5,The best House of the Rising Sun!,I borrowed this album 19 years ago from my sister and never returned it!! She found the CD on Amazon and sent it to me. Listened to it after not hearing it for several years and fell in love with it again! The greatest version of The House of the Rising Sun you will ever hear. Enjoy!
4,I loved it!,"The author tells a story well, but also plays with the reader. Several times you will stop, scratch your head and ask,""Was that directed to me?...and then the story continues. I loved the cynicism or blind faith (in anything) of the various characters and the slow corrosion thereof. The subject matter is facinating and rarely explored. Best of all, this is not a sappy, emotional story, actually, quite the opposite. When a holocaust story makes you laugh, it should be explored"
4,Mansfield Park stays faithful,"Just as the heroine, Fanny Price, stays faithful to her unspoken love for her cousin, this dramatization of Jane Austen's Mansfield Park stays faithful to Austen's intent, if not to every detail. The film does not dwell on Fanny's youth, but moves you directly into her conflict of watching her love interest, Edmund Bertram, fall prey to the charms of a flirtatious, materialistic new neighbor.Actress Billie Piper does a wonderful job as the grounded, dependable Fanny who stays true to her heart despite the pressures around her to accept another suitor. If you can get past the idea of cousins falling in love (and Austen fans must!), this Masterpiece theatre film is a real treat."
3,Another one,"The reason Mansfield Park is so difficult to put on film is that there are in fact multiple plotlines, more so than in any other Austen novel, and an adaptation for film requires some degree of truncation. That happened here too."
2,Bad Casting,"This had potential and the script is certainly better than the 1999 one, but Billie Piper completely ruins it. She is jarringly out of place as Fanny Price. She is far too modern looking and robust for the part. I know she is very popular in England, but most Americans don't really get the appeal. She's pretty, but very wrong here.The rest of the cast are fair enough, but the script is choppy. I wish a good version of Mansfield Park would be made."
3,Sadly only so-so...,"I am very loathe to give any film adaption of my beloved Jane Austen's works anything below five stars, but I have to be honest, it was not very good. In my opinion, it is Billie Piper's horrendously bad performance as the protagonist, who drags the film down, as the rest of the cast is quite good. I have always liked Blake Ritson, though his Edmund is also somewhat difficult to sympathize with. I wish, they had cast someone else as Fanny. She is meant to be somewhat naive, but Piper is simply no good at playing a sweet, innocent girl(and I'm afraid her very large, very dark eyebrows, and very light blonde hair were strangely distracting to me, but maybe I'm just being picky). Anyway, if you have read Mansfield Park, don't watch this, it will disappoint, if you are looking for something with a nice set, costumes, and handsome and pretty actors, this may satisfy. Let's hope for a better version of this story in the very near future."
1,Mansfield revisited by fools.,"In all the English speaking world, I can't think of a young actress less suited to play Fanny Price than Billie Piper. Why do so many film directors think that Jane Austen needs to be changed for contemporary audiences? We keep buying the books and loving them as they are, so why think that we can only relate to running, bouncing, loud, flamboyant protagonists?Fanny is my and Jane Austen's favorite and I'll not soon forgive this travesty, for both our sakes."
3,"I have no idea if it ""follows""book or not, it was pretty to look at","I thought that I liked this movie when I first saw it on PBS, Billie Piper impressed me, but when I watched it again on DVD I was disappointed.I guess that I'm just not a Jane Austen fan, as a British period historical drama Mansfield Park looks good but it just wasn't something I'd repeatedly watch.I did notice, while watching it on DVD, that Michelle Ryan (soon to be ""Bionic Woman"") had a small role- her character dropped out part way through the movie and somehow I wasn't satisfied with how that was handled."
2,Ho - Hum!,"This was the most boring production of a Jane Austen novel that I have ever watched. There is no real action throughout. You never get a real sense of who the characters are and why they act as they do. Fanny Price barely says a word for the first half of the movie. The scenery is gorgeous but other than that, I can not say anything positive about this movie. If you want a good movie version of Mansfield Park, get the 1999 version. It is more in depth and true to the Austen novel and the acting is vastly superior."
3,"Good Delivery, Messy Product","Purchase and Delivery of product was excellent, but the product was disappointing and not what I had hoped for."
1,Desaparecido,"Compre este producto y nunca llego, no tenía experíencia para hacer compras por internet y no sabía hacerle seguimiento y nadie se hizo responsable y el producto desaparecio y no me devolvieron el dinero. quede decepcionada."
5,gameshark the best,this is really great for really confusing games. i had a lot of fun with it. you should to if you buy it. i had a lot of fun with the games finalfantasy X and a lot of racing games to. you can get stuff you want and stuff you dont want. this is really great
1,playstation 2 gameshark,"To all consumers that purchased a ps2 gameshark. I just recently bought one and mine didn't work either, so i called the makers of the gameshark and they told me basicly the same thing everyone else was told, and i have a ps2 system that has an older date code(bought when it first came out). So what I did was told it back and explained to the store manager what the problem was(whick gameshark is not compatible with my sytem and recieved my money back. If they refuse get a new one try it if itdoesnt work take it back again and again and again until they give you your money back."
1,awaiting shipment,"I bought, and PAID FOR, a Game Shark 2 from TOBEYSELL on August 10th. It was stated that it would have been shipped by the 12th and today is the 18th and it still has not begun its shipment to me. The very same time I purchased a PS2 and game and they were shipped next day and arrived by the 14th. I'm very pleased with those results yet for some reason my other purchased item has not been sent. You'd think that if for some reason the seller, TOBEYSELL, were out of stock they would refund my money or inform me of the reason for the hold up in shipping my merchandise.-a very distraught customer-"
1,Game Shark is no good!,"After finding that the game shark really doesn't work as advertised. After reading instructions, no cheat codes seemed to work, and the performance of my PS2 went way down. I tried to return and could not get my money back and now am going to only shop where companies offer satisfaction guarantees.I feel ripped off!"
1,This won't work with some Playstation 2's,I bought this peripheral (Version 1.3) today to help me out in some games. I plug it in and it says that the version of the software that I have wont work with my Playstation 2 because my Playstation 2 has safeguards against it. So the software says to contact Gameshark.com for more updates. DON'T BUY THIS IF YOU BOUGHT YOUR PLAYSTATION 2 WITH THE GT3 BUNDLE PACK!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,game shark for ps2,"If your interested in cheating and just messing around with your games, game shark is for you, plus you can get more codes at game shark.com for new games.Game shark does not cost much, but I prefer only using it when you get stuck in a game or have beaten it"
2,poor documentation,"I know it seems silly to expect much documentation on an old-style car compass but .. this thing comes with instructions for an older model that has no light. The compass obviously has a battery compartment on the back but I can't figure out how to open it (unscrewing it doesn't work). There is a thing sticking out of the front that presumably activates the light but since I can't install a battery I guess I'll never know. If I had it to do over again, I'd pick something else."
1,Bogus ad,"The ad for this product shows Sherill Compass 18103 as a compass with 5 degree graduations. The received product is Sherill Compass 18103 but has only 15 degree graduations. In addition, the tradename ""Airguide"" which shows on the picture in the ad does not appear on the received product.This is misrepresentation. The 15 degree graduated compass is of course cheaper and less applicable that a 5 degree graduated compass. 15 Degree graduated compasses of this size are readily available in many stores at about $8.00.I have no use for this product, as I already have several of this quality. What should I do?"
4,The book with it's own mind,"This book is awesome, it starts out as they are in the future, and ends when they are young. This book is full of exciting events, and different problems. Its about a family and four girls. These girls have all their own problems, and a lto of problems with guys, and gifts. The book is all about how the girls lot theri accents, and trust me you can;t put the book down. They also get caught with frugs, put on the spot with sex, and even go to dance shows. Read this book and you will love the layout, and all the interesting facts abotu these girls. They all learn from their experioences in their own way. So I rat e this a 4 star, b/c to me it's a fun book to read, and I would say anyone from middleschool and up could read this, so go out and read this book today its a good one."
1,Snow=Bad Bad & not good!,"What can we say about this chapter? Nothing nice! Although we did not read the entire thing, we read the chapter about ""Snow"". NO offense to the author or anything but it was horrid. No plot, theme, no point at all. The story was hard to follow because of it's dullness and lack of substance. An easy read, sounding as though it was written by Yolanda herself (a 4th grader). This story on ""Snow"" was thought-provoking-less! We both apologize to Mrs. Alvarez for this harsh review but we completely missed any meaning or point of the story ""Snow"". Thank you."
1,Waste of Time,"How the Garcia Girls lost their accents by Julia Alvarez , is about a coming of age story of a family moving from one country to another. The Garcia girls face daily stuggles with being different. They move from Puerto Rico to the united States and face challenges.A significant moment is when they leave their Island. The father has gotten into some trouble with the government and the family needs to leave. After a long process, they move to New York, where the girls face different bumps in the road by being different.The author tended to be random, saying things about a girl who was an anorexic monkey, but talking about one of the girls.We would not recommend this book to anyone. The way she uses her words and describes the character is not at all engaging. Quite frankly we found the book boring. All in all if you have a strange urge to read a book of randomness, then go to the library, but this book is really not worth your dollar."
4,family life for women,"This is a book that I think women will enjoy more than men as it reflects on their struggles and aspirations once moving from a caribbean country to the united states. there n easy flow to this author's writing. She is compassionate and desperate when she needs to be and that emotion is compelling to me, the reader."
1,NO,"worst book. so confusing and boring and just plain weird....If you just want to read this for fun, DONT"
2,Why should you care how the Garcia girls lost their accents?,"If you like reading books that tell a story, have a main point and come to a perfect, nice, neat ending then you shouldn't read this book. This book contains a bunch of stories about a family and their struggles and how they deal. It brings up many issues that make it interesting to read but it has no plot. Just as a family there is no beginning or end and there for when you write a book on a family there is no beginning and no end, you can talk about family members before you but that's it. And just as this book had no plot but only stories, families have no plot and have memories and each other to stay close to."
4,How the Garcia Girls Lost Their Accents,"I really enjoyed this book. Alvarez's unique stle of writing makes the book very interesting and gives you many different perspectives to see the situation in which they lived. Although this is a fiction book, Alvarez gives insight as to what the times were like in Dominican Republic when it was under the rule of Trujillo. In following the lives of these four sisters, you will see the hardships and joys of growing up. This book also does a great job of showing the how these girls were able to adapt to a new culture, and shows the different cycles they go through as they adapt to the United States. I recommend this book very highly. It's different, but enjoyable."
2,Looks great but...,"This combination of two backpacks that can be attached together sounds and looks great, but just doesn't make much sense. Zipped together they are far too bulky and heavy to be used as a single backback and so must be wheeled, but it will be too front heavy to stay upright on it's own. If one were to separate the two backpacks to use the smaller as a daypack, you'll see that it's too small to do you much good unless you're just going to carry a book and a sandwich- I was not able to fit a light sweater into it. I only used this for one trip, and now I just take a nice rolling carry- on and a backpack. I have a lot more room that way."
4,Wonderful Edna Ferba adaptation,"""Saratoga Trunk"" is one of Ferber's finest novels. She captures the essence of New Orleans and Saratoga in the late 19th century.The movie is remarkably true to the novel..what's more, given the war-time deprivations when the film was made, the sets are outstanding.Just wish the movie had stayed on course with the novel at the end..but still very much worth your while to view."
1,Absolute Junk,Absolute Junk!!! Don't believe your vehicle will fit any of these mudflaps. Low grade and cheap! Enough said!
2,Barely Decent,"I've now been using this router for a few month, so I had time to 'evaluate' it... I found this routher to be EXTREMLY unstable; it looses wireless connections for no reason (direct ethernet connection to it works fine). There are sometimes random periods of time where all connections on it turn on and off for hours at a time making it quite impossible to use. Also it tends to lose connections alot when transfering large files between computers and/or are trying to upload or download large files to and from the web. Its a decent router if you're using it for 5 minutes at a time, but anything longer then that... well, simply put it sucks for anything longer... I would suggest getting a Lynksis or a Netgear router; costs a lil more but atleast you can rely on those."
5,Very refreshing.,"I have been a fan of Claudja since she released her first tracks here in the US on Salsoul records. Saw her perform live several times in the 80s, and she was just as phenomenal in person as she was on vinyl. This CD contained tracks I had never heard before. Thanks for all the memories Claudja."
3,Hawkwind - 'Live & Rare: Onward Flies The Bird' (Emporio),"A decent quality budget priced CD aimed probably at Hawkwind die-hards, for the most part. However, if you happen to be a new fan, 'Live & Rare' isn't bad to have first, before you have a chance to check out all their actual album reissues. Total of fifteen cuts, several of which came off their 'Acid Daze 1' and 'Acid Daze 2' compilation discs. It's always nice to hear the ""Motorhead"" edit where Dave Brock sings instead of Lemmy, as well as these live versions of ""Born To Go"", ""Earth Calling"", ""Space Is Deep"" and ""You Shouldn't Do That"". Those last two came from 'Best & The Rest Of...' (see my review). Also dug the rehearsal cut of ""Magma"" and their experimental tune ""Douglas In The Jungle"" that SEEMS like it's a different mix than the one that showed up on one of the 'Weird Tapes' releases. Funny thing, this CD has been out for awhile now and until recently, I've never seen a copy of it anywhere. Go figure."
3,Glad I didn't read this one first.,I read both The Love Affair of an English Lord & The Wedding Night of an English Rogue. I'm glad I did because I love them. I wouldn't have tried them if I read this book first. This book drags on & on. The dialog was boring. This book was missing something. It was a BIG disappointment. Only read this book all the way through because I read the other two books. Please try The Love Affair of an English Lord & The Wedding Night of an English Rogue because they have the magic this one does not.
5,"Best Version of ""I Love A Man In A Uniform""","I bought the original vinyl album in a Soho record shop, sometime around 1980. I just now bought the cd version here on Amazon. Because I have downloaded the raw-er versions of ""I Love A Man In A Uniform"", I can tell you that they were not fully developed until the version which was recorded for this album. The version on this album makes full use of an accentuated pause in the beat, just before a whiplash backbeat is struck. This unique pause in the syncopation exists in the earlier, more primitive versions, but was played too fast to create the intoxicating new wave backbeat which is heard in this, the final one. The voices of the female singers whom accompany the band, belt out their backup with precise intensity. The sound is slick, but fantastically danceable---just as it was in 1980. Personally, I think that it is one of the really excellent examples of post-punk new wave songs."
3,Works with PCs too.,"The manufacturer specializes in products marketed to be compatible only with Apple computers. The packaging of this is no exception, stating that a Mac is required. But there are lots of firewire IDE enclosures on the market, and this one seemed to use the same standard firewire technology as they do. So I took a chance on hooking this up to my Windows XP machine, with a 45 GB drive, and it worked just fine. It makes it much easier to migrate data off my old drives, rather than trying to install them into my new PC's cramped case."
5,Polenta,"I will definitely buy this product again. It is excellent, fast to prepare and the flavor and consistency are perfect."
3,Small and Pricey,"The keychain works fine, with clear directions for set up. Some of the pictures I tried to import cropped funny on the keychain, cutting off heads. The screen is so tiny, and the price so high, that I would not recommend this item. Maybe if the price drops to $20 it would be worth the money."
1,This toy is very fragile,This toy is very fragile and it got broken in second day of my fours old son received it.This toy is not for play for sure.
2,"spooky, breathy disco darkness...","Hey friends, I'm only reviewing this so you don't have towaste the time I did in listening to the (30 sec) samples.I know... perhaps that isn't giving this album a fair shake,but here's one opinion: ...you MAY agree, and maybe NOT!I found this record to be an eerie cross between BW's LoveUnlimited Orchestra and the soundtrack to Xanadu! (An awful,nauseating combo, to say the least!) I ran across this whilesearching for good (disco-style) dance music, and while I donot claim to know anything about YOUR tastes, I did NOT findthis music too enjoyable OR danceable, at all!Bottom line: Save your time AND your money. PASS THIS ONE BY!"
5,PopCo b y Scarlett Thomas,"Having read The End of Mr Y, I was keen to read other works by Scarlett Thomas. Thoroughly enjoyed PopCo and am now looking forward to Our Tragic Universe.Scarlett Thomas may not appeal to everyone, in that she writes at a demanding level. Absolutely well worth the effort."
4,Condition mislabeled,"While I am glad to have a copy of this cookbook, there were several online to choose from, and I chose the one in ""very good"" condition. The binding is broken, there is a large inscription written inside the front cover, and the outside shows wear."
4,More Relevant Than You Might Think,"An omnipotent teenager can't figure out how to get along with adults. That's what I like about the original series, the messages are clear and timeless.Spock plays (chess and lute), Uhuru sings, Kirk wrestles, and Yeoman Rand gets spanked! Definitely an eventful episode."
1,Confused,"Looking at the cover, I see 2 flaws already. Being a following muslim , 1 must first note that Elijah is a false prophet of Allah. He is a black leader and the begginer of the nation. His teachings are not of Islam - rather a small portion on Islam and Christianity and the rest is black pride. Do not confuse true Islam with this Imposter prophet's works. 2nd flaw is the cover shows a crescent star for Islam and the US flag for Christians. Any intelligent person knows that US is not run by christians. For those seeking true Islam, and a real comparision, I would recommend www.jannah.com . For more on Islam and science see www.harunyahya.com . For those chrisitans trying to comprehend truth from a former preacher of christianity please seek http://www.islamtomorrow.com ."
1,This toy is a piece of garbage!,"It does not work at all!! I tried using the bubble solution it came with, bubble bath and gymboree bubbles and it WOULD NOT make any bubbles!! Don't waste your money!"
1,Disappointing,Our 5 year old son saw this toy and wanted it so bad so my husband and I got it for him. What a mistake. I put it in his tub and the purple button on the color chamber got jammed when I pushed it and will not work anymore. This was the FIRST use. Then the bubbles did not come out as they were supposed too. They barely came out at all. And the other piece that you turn with the propeller looking piece that is in the water did NOT do anything at all. It was a disappointment and all of this with the first use. I am definitely going to return it. I would not buy it. Find something better. Not worth the money.tracey
2,Also does not provide complete scores,"Maybe everyone else got the full version, but from my reading this book provides intricate details about the listed songs but they are not the complete song. They are only half of the score or so for each entry, which I guess is what they feel enough to give you the gist of what the song is about. Whatever... I need more than that."
2,Beatles are good...book not so good...,"I got this from a used dealer...evidently I read the description wrong as I thought there was supposed to be a DVD with it...the dealer offered to take it back...but for $12-13.00 that I put into it...didn;t think it was worth thehassle of returning it...so I kept the book...note: the DVD envelope was still in the book binding, just no DVD...I was expecting a book of Beatles songs really geared for the acoustic...yes Blackbird is in the book...and so is Norwegian Wood, both great acoustic songs...but for the most part the rest of them really don;t work as well as I was hoping for as acoustic songs...Revolution...???...really doesn't work without the electric...Of the many Beatles song books out there I guess this is about average...it's better than nothing...but the next time I'm looking for a songbook, I'm going to a music store where I can open the pages and seeexactly what I'm getting..."
5,Review of Best of The Beatles for Acoustic Guitar (Guitar Signature Licks),"This was a gift for my 14-year-old son, who plays guitar. It may take him some time to work through it. I'll reaspond again once he tells me his impressions (or I hear they through his playing.)"
3,could not play in my vcr,"I was happy to receive the dvd, but it could not play in my vcr. I had to play it in my computer."
5,Anything Mickey is a go!,This game looks great.Looks like its going to be alot of fun.A great Christmas gift.Many hrs. of gaming will be enjoyed.
3,Pretty good,I purchased the game thinking it would be easy as it was for a day-care center. I was WRONG! There are a lot of controls and many secrets. The bosses are pretty hard and the game is very long. I'm 19 and love games so I was able to play it and enjoy it myself but the children cannot.
2,Worthington Vegetarian,Whoever Worthington Vegetarian uses to ship is a very POOR shipper!Over HALF (6) of the cans of Burger I received were DENTED. Iam too nervous to use them. What I have used is not the best Vegiproduct I have tasted. The Texture is pretty close to real meat butWE really do not like the flavor. I have to OVER season it with a lot ofHeat spices or mix it with real meat for my son to even nibble at it.The entire reason I paid soooo much $44.00 for it was to help convert my son away from real burger. Forget that! He'll never trust me again.So I will Never trust Worthington again.
5,Tastes good and great to have on hand,"This is the best with taco seasoning in tacos and burritos and taco salads. We also used it for chili and sloppy joes. I like it because it tastes really good and it's low fat, but another huge benefit is that it is canned, so I can make it whenever I am in the mood to. I rarely eat meat, so it is frustrating for me when I buy meat to have to eat it quickly before it goes bad. I never have to worry with this :)It also heats up really quickly. Even if you are not vegetarian, this is the ultimate convenience food. I love it."
5,Ideal for the storage shelf,"Worthington Vegetarian Burger is an excellent product to have on hand in the cupboard. Use it for almost anything that would be made with ground beef, such as meatballs, casseroles or loaves. Flavor and texture are very pleasing, you avoid cholesterol and the product is not greasy. If you are unaware that it's a vegetarian product, you may suspect that those ""meatballs"" you're eating are made with ground turkey.Amazon's price was excellent, too!"
1,[Weak],"This product is based on 1970's era technology. The LCD is simply atrocious and it is very difficult to distinguish the pieces from each other. You're better off getting chess software for your Palm pilot. When I first saw this product I thought, ""Great! The whole machine is devoted to chess processing! It must be fast and smart!"" However, the machine takes several minutes to move and, sadly, it doesn't always make the intelligent moves, even at the higher levels...."
2,left my hair dry and limp,I love B&B products so when this came out I grabbed it! It did not work well w/ my hair for some reason. I do have dry and processed hair and I love the gentle line I was hoping this would be even more moisturizing but not the case. It made my hair straw-like and dull and limp.
1,Pruduct not Bumble and Bumble,"I was deeply disappointed with this product. It is definitely not the Bumble and Bumble from my salon. At first it simply seemed watery, no where near as thick as the real product. I had some of the original left and compared, definitely not the same viscosity. I attributed that to first use, but it did not improve. Second, I noticed that rather than moisturizing like the real product, it seemed to have a drying, stripping impact. And the smell was off, couldn't quite place it until I picked up some baby shampoo. It smells remarkably like Johnson and Johnson dimestore brand. This product is a rip off. The best I can tell, they are bottling some cheaper brand name, watering it down and selling it at full price. I won't be purchasing from this vendor again."
1,Diluted Shampoo???,"I have been using this product for years and these 2 bottles seemed of a different quality. They did not lather up the same, felt diluted, as if there was water in them. Something was wrong with these bottles. I would never order from here again. Would rather but it in a store."
2,Too Small,"Nice looking hat, but too low profile for my head. No matter how hard I pull it down it hasn't the internal capacity to swallow my melon and stay on securely. Like the low profile look but guess I need more of a mid-height cap to get that look without the thing falling off.Have ordered another brown waxed foul weather cap [...]Hope to have better luck... I'll give the 1st to my friend."
2,Recycled Information,"While I don't disgree with pretty much any of the information of ideas presented in this book, I found it to be a pretty simplistic repetition of many of the otehr self-development books I've read in the past few years. That's the ""danger"" of buying self-development books - for some (new to the ideas), a book like this might be life changing, but for folks who have read dozens of books that may each go into greater detail, the book becomes a quick scan and a bit of a disappointment. That being said, I recently read ANOTHER book that I thought consolidated much of the current research on personal change (""This Year, I will..."" Ryan), and bought multiple copies to give to friends. That book took the researcch and put a different or more focused spin on the ideas."
5,perfect!,I bought a few of these books as baby gifts for friends. They are perfect. The book is a nice size and the illustrations are beautiful. This was one of my favorite books as a child and I had a hard time finding it. Thanks!
1,A photocopy of a 1916 book,"Don't be fooled by the publication date as given by Amazon: this book was written in 1916, and this is book is a photocopy. As to content, it includes only artifacts -- nothing about structures larger than a gravesite. I'm very disappointed that the description is so misleading."
5,bong goes the bell in the rickety tower,This book is fantastic. I have been reading it to my daughter for a couple of years now. We have read it so many times that I have half the book memorized. Definatley a must have!!
3,Reference for Common Perennials,"This is a good reference guide for the most common perennials. I was a bit disappointed that it did not feature more details on lesser known perennial gems, particularly native plant species. I also would have appreciated a bit more on invasive species so that Illinois gardeners can lend a hand at irradicating them rather than cultivating them!"
2,Did it even do anything?,Been using it everyday for a month and it's hard to tell if it even did anything. Still have a lot of the same blueish black under my eyes that I've had my whole adult life.A plus is it's easy to apply. Doesn't sting too bad if it gets in your eyeball either.
3,taste is good,the price isn't any better than what i can purchase from a local candy store and same taste without the wait
4,Batter up!,"It seems wasteful for these to all be individually boxed, but otherwise this was a great purchase. Anybody who plays wiffleball knows you need a bunch of balls to have a fun game. If you just have one ball, you spend a lot of time chasing them down and throwing back to the pitcher. With 12+ balls, you can keep the pitches coming and a have a lot more fun, and not have your game end if a ball gets stuck in a gutter or chewed up by a dog."
5,Robin Trower Still Has It At 60,"With LIVING OUT OF TIME LIVE, Robin Trower proves that, at age 60, he still has more energy than many rockers half his age. Davey Pattison does a great job on vocals, joining with bassist Dave Bronze to successfully fill the late James Dewar's shoes. A half-hour exercise walk taken while listening to this CD took me through only four songs, which proves that brevity is definitely not one of Trower's calling cards. However, that's not a problem, because he is truly one of rock's great improvisers, a trait greatly lacking in today's pop-oriented musical climate. No fan of rock music can afford to be without this CD."
2,Very Dissapointed and boring.........,"I have been a big fan of Robin Trower since the 70's....he still plays and sounds great, singing is just ok.............yet NO stage appearance or nor is there any electrifying stage experience in this video, Just kind of boring to watch , Save your money and download the digital album available for 10.00 on I-tunes much better......"
5,Only DVD from Greatest Living Guitar Player,Quality performance from greatest living guitar player finally captured on camera. A must for any serious rock fan. If you never heard or saw Trower live you are in for a treat (I might be a little bias since I have seen him over 35 times live!). The solo on Daydream is a thing of beauty.
4,Still Rockn',"I was not one bit disappointed with this DVD. Sometimes it's risky going to see performers that are, shall we say ""pass their prime"". I'm sure this audience that Trower played for in Germany on September 2005 didn't feel that this cat was past his prime.Trower was celebrating his sixtieth birthday and his playing was as fluid as ever. Even his new songs have that classic Trower stamp; long lush sustaining notes at just the right time and psychedelic guitar tone. Robin is actually improving as time goes on. Isn't that the way it's suppose to be? The lead singer Davey Pattison sounds hauntingly like the original singer who sang most of these songs in the seventies. If you're a Trower fan this is an adult portion that should hit the spot. -Drew"
1,Aren't defense mechanisms cool?,"Those darn witches -- they must be behind this! It couldn't have anything to do with us, those problems within the church. No!One of the greatest things about Amazon is that you can stumble across books written by those whose beliefs are remarkably different from one's own. Sometimes I have to add them to my shopping cart out of perverse curiosity.Not wanting to repeat history, I will not throw any book into a bonfire. I wish many pious Christians would give witches the same respect."
2,Ironic,"Rick Godwin's preaching is certainly for the more practical as opposed to the more stern or sentimental. But what has caught me is that he wrote this book and in 2007, it became widely known he was using church funds for private jets, expensive hotels, vacations, gifts, etc. Same as Pastor John Hagee preaching against divorce and he was messing with his church secretary. I haven't read this book, so I give two stars (I have to rate it in order for this to be seen online!)"
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!,"Don't get me wrong--this is a great read and I highly recommend it. I do object to the quality of this book--it looks like it came off a laser printer, the type on the page is irregular and the picture reproduction is abysmal. ...Great book, lousy publishing!"
3,Disappointing Book,"I heard about ""Land that Moves, Land that Stands Still"" on NPR where it was enthusiastically reviewed, and since it is set in the Black Hills, where I live, I was eager to read it and ordered it immediately. For the first hundred pages or so I thought this was going to be a really good book. Disappointment set in when I began to realize that the main characters, all women, were really acting like men. There is a lot of sex, violence, drug use and drunkenness by these women and they even beat up the sheriff. I know a number of self-reliant, hard working women who love the land, but I don't think they'd have much patience with these women. And the author's idea of a happy ending seems to be to have a woman end up with a man. Although the Black Hills are used as the setting, I think the book could have been set anywhere in the west as I felt the author had no greater intuitive understanding of the landscape than he had for how women think, feel, and act."
2,Not as perfect as expected.,"I was lead to believe by the Ad from the seller (so I doubled my order) that I would be able to link a total of eight (8) phones to each other. But when I called the manufacturer they said the Max was only four (4). If the dialing was not so slow and the sound quality (clarity) of each handset was better, I wouldn't feel that I had spent too much ""new"" money for an 80's level of phone.I would recommend that you call the seller (if they are a dealer) then you will have the opportunity to return the product when it does not meet up to your expectations."
5,Finally a doll done right for babies,"Some things are best done simply, and this doll is just that. It is so soft and cuddly that no baby could resist it. My daughter refers to her as ""baby da"" and goes no where without her. She has her in the crib, in the car, in the park. It has seen its share of the floor and dirt. What's best is that it washes up easy and keeps its shape. We love it."
5,Does exactly what it's supposed to,This adapter allowed me to use my classic Mac keyboard and Kensington TurboMouse withwith IMac System 10.2.8. Very happy.
1,Only in Russian!,"The same thing happened to me as to the other reviewer-- I ordered this book on Amazon, and they sent me the Russian version. I returned the book and requested the English version, and again received the Russian version. If you need this book, find a source other than Amazon."
3,air show extreme (blu-ray),video was great. I have never been to an air show before where music was played so loud it drowned out the roar of the engines and ruined the show.
5,Absolutely Perfect Flutes!,"I am a bride to be and bought these flutes for our wedding toast. I saw them at Macys for $140 plus tax and decided to see if amazon carried them. THEY DO! and I purchased them for only $115 without having to pay shipping or tax since they are Amazon Prime. They are very sturdy, heavy, well made crystal. Of course they're a wonderful set of flutes since they are made my Waterford. They come in a wonderful box with foam so they will not get damaged and are easy to store or wrap for a gift. I plan on getting them engraved before the wedding. They look even more gorgeous in person! Absolutely wonderful buy!"
3,Simple English text,"Meet Beverly Cleary is a lightweight introduction (24 pages) to the life of the author. For a more detailed account of her life for young readers, check out Cleary's own memoirs A Girl from Yamhill and My Own Two Feet."
5,The Big Thicket and Beyond,"During my first drive across the southwest, I recognized the washes, thickets and open spaces Stark so vividly portrayed in his novel and enjoyed the sense that I had been there before. Years had passed since reading Chasing Uncle Charlie, but it all came flooding back: Bo's thirst for adventure, the quirky but powerfully real characters that guide and misguide his journey. This definately ranks among my favorites."
1,Very disappointing,"This book is very disappointing. It's a sort of ""empty"" book, full of cheapest moral consideration et TOTALY lacking any spiritual/religious notion... It has no single reference to catholic teaching (though it's presented as a sort of ""catholic book""). It cares some terrible misconceptions about humain psychology and sexuality.If you read want to have a clear and courageous view of what sexual wisdom is and should be, read a very old but extremly fresh book by the Pope Jean Paul II called ""Love and Responsability"""
1,This is not what you expect to get,"I am a psychobiology and i know for fat that the human kind needs sex, this books refers and talks about abstenence, humans needs sex, they just have to learn how to control their desires that that is it. Don't waste your money on it ok."
2,A never ending story...,This book was filled with seemingly never ending stories about long shoe laces.
1,Disgusting,"Utterly disgusting. Brainless, meaningless, putrid. I have five words for these girls: Don't Quit Your Day Jobs!"
2,AWFUL Locking Door Insert,"This Dog Door is a good size for a smaller to medium dog. We have an English Springer Spaniel and she has no problem going through it. The stiff flap bothered her for a while though. I would prefer the flexible, thick one that comes with another brand if I had considered it.The bad thing is the VERY cheap and difficult locking door insert. It is just a plastic insert that has two pegs on the bottom and snaps onto the top of the frame. To get it off you have to push in on a little release point on the bottom as you pull the insert up on top, and it's awkward it hurts your fingers to do it.I wouldn't buy this dog door again due to the lousy locking insert."
3,Tricky Install,"The door itself, works real good. However it took me over 2 hours to install due to the number of pieces involved. I bought the small door, also, and that one took only 30 min. Why the medium could not be made in the same manner as the small one, puzzles me. I've installed doggie doors before and I'd rather pay someone $50 to do it for me. It's Pain vs Gain."
2,Dated,"This book would have been up to date about 15 years ago. Much of the information and descriptions appear in older works, and more modern weapons are completely omitted. For example, there are no mention of the M-4 carbine, which has all but replaced the M-16A2 in US military service; the AN-94 assault rifle and Bizon SMG from Russia; the M240 machinegun (although the FN MAG does get a good article). The M-47 Dragon AT missile is in here, but no mention of the Javelin missile which has entirely replaced it. Likewise, recoilless rifles which haven't seen service anywhere but the Third World for the last 25 years get articles, but no info on many more modern systems. Overall, the quality of the book isn't so bad, but this book was published in 1996. It might as well have been 1976."
1,E-Mail address book,"This book is the size of my wallet. It was to small to write in.I read the reviews before I bought it. Most people liked it,except one.I put every detal in my address books, that I might forget.(age can do this to you). I returned this book. I ended up at an office supply store, and found just what I was looking for.I would not recomend this book, unless you just want to put an e-mail adress in,and not your password or thier phone number, or anything else."
3,Weak compared to other releases of Torke,"Unfortunately, the offerings on this CD are not anywhere near as strong as Torke's best music -- from the 80's and early 90's. Thankfully, the wonderful recordings of those pieces have been re-released on Ecstatic Records (Torke's own label).In particularly, look out for ""Four Proverbs"", ""Book of Proverbs"", ""Saxophone Concerto"", and some of his shorter concert overtures such as ""Javelin"" and ""Run.""Skip this Naxos disc and explore his other recordings for a better introduction to the zestful and exciting music of this composer."
5,Best Crib Cuddle Friend!,"I bought this giraffe for my son when I first found out I was pregnant. It was waiting in the crib for his arrival! As a newborn, he loved to look at the giraffe and enjoyed the soothing music. 19 months later, it is his favorite friend still! My son falls asleep while rubbing a foot or the tail of the giraffe. Many a time I have walked in my son's room to check on him and he was sound asleep, hugging his animal friend. What a sweet toy!"
5,Best Game Ever Played I actualy rate it 6 stars,This Game Is Like The Best When You Unlcok Evreything Takes Weeks Though But Still AWSOME If You Have An Extreme Upsetion With The Simpsons I LOVE THE SIMPSONS
2,Disappointing.,"A number of months ago, my friend and I were playing on my friend's Playstation 2. My friend had just gotten The Simpsons: Road Rage, and I must say it was the best PS2 game I ever played. So when I saw the game was available for GameBoy Advance, I got really excited. So, I bought it and played it, and boy was I disappoited! The graphics weren't as good, there was no talking at all, it was a lot harder to control, there are a bunch of annoying things you can't drive on, the locations are smaller, and there are a bunch of other problems with the game. Get the PS2 version, not the GameBoy Advance version."
2,Don't Expect the Original,"I had been waiting for this game to be released for ages. I am a HUGE fan of the console version, and I couldn't wait to be able to take the game with me. I couldn't be more disappointed! First of all, the game play is way more difficult. Unlike the console version, there are curbs and other boundaries preventing you from driving anywhere you want. It's very hard to see where to go, and exteremly easy to get lost (which costs you valuable time). There's no save feature, instead you have to write down passwords, which to me is a bit primitive considering most GBA games have save options. Finally, there are NO SIMPSONS VOICES!! I know that the advance can easily reproduce voices, and I think the Simpsons tag lines make up over half the fun of the game. I hate to say it, but this game could not be more of a letdown...d'oh!!"
3,Not Quite Perfect,"This is a somewhat fun game. Whatever you do do not be deceived by the pictures at the top of the screen, the graphics are horrible. It can be a fun game if you enjoy Crazy Taxi(which I do), but to tell the truth, it is overrated. A big con is that if you get $1 million you win the game and there is nothing else to play for, and there is no reason to come back and play it."
4,Schwinn 418 Elliptical Trainer,Easy to put together.The works you get from it is GREAT. Smooth stride.There no backlite to see the display which would have been nice but it a great machine.
5,WHAT A KNOCK OUT MACHINE!!!,"What a great piece of elliptical machine. I purchased mine through Craigslist for only $200 bucks! What a steal right?! Assembled a few parts and I was ready to give it a try...IT WAS VERY STURDY AND SMOOTH!!! I can honestly say, this is probably one of the best elliptical machines I have ever used!Now off I go losing some extra weight!!!"
3,Schwinn 418 Elliptical Trainer Review,"I was very discouraged when I realized that I had to assemble nearly ever part of this machine, and even more distressed when I saw what was actually being used to hold some of the parts together. I enjoy using the machine, but feel that it probably won't last longer than a year, or two at the most. I spent a lot of time reading some of the instructions over and over again for comprehension. It's not ideal for small spaces, as it not space saver friendly. Likewise, I enjoy working out, and hope to reach my fitness goal, before this machine clunks out."
4,"Assembly Not Bad, Machine Totally Silent","I almost didn't buy this elliptical because of the nightmarish reviews about the assembly process.Well, I've just completed it, and it wasn't as bad as I thought. Here are a few things to be ready for:- the box is huge, and bulky - make sure you've got a pretty big space to work in, and have a plan for a mountain of styrofoam at the end- go slowly. I worked from the instructions very closely, and would grade the documentation at a solid ""B"" -- a little cryptic at times, but ultimately workable- improvise - there were FOUR washers left out of my box, and one (critical) nut that had no threads. I called Schwinn, and they dispatched the two more (threaded) nuts second-day air (pretty cheerfully), and then I went to the hardware store, spent $3 - and bought what I neededFinally, after about 2 hours, I was left with a pretty cool, completely silent elliptical machine that I'll look forward to using tomorrow morning. And a mountain of styrofoam.So far, so good."
3,Noisy Schwinn 418,"Purchased the Schwinn 418 after reading several favorable reviews and not seeing any negative comments. After using it for 2 weeks it developed an annoying squeal in the pedal cranks. I disassembled them and greased them using wheel bearing grease and within a few minutes of use again, started squealing. I called Schwinn, got voice prompts and ultimately a voice mail, left message, also sent e-mail asking if this has been an issue, if so, do they have a fix for it. 4 days have passed and they still have not responded.I like the design and the computerized programs, makes it fun to use after having a manual elliptical for many years. Overall, I think it is a good product, if only we could get it to stop squealing."
1,Doesn't hold up,"I was very happy with this machine for a short time. Then it started making a clunking noise in one of the pedals. At first I was able to make it go away by tightening screws. Now, only having had the machine for about a month, I cannot stop the thing from popping and clunking when I use it. $800 is not cheap for a rickety clunky machine."
4,Great equipment...great price,"Saw this as a Consumer Reports ""Best Buy"" and made the purchase even though we hadn't tried it in a store. Delivery was a bit slow, but smooth, even around the holidays, and the set up was a breeze (2 people, 1.5 hrs). Didn't have any issues with missing parts. Works very smoothly...I'll update my review when I've had a chance to work out on the machine for a few weeks."
2,very loud,"I purchased this trainer about 3 months back, as it is most economical elliptical trainer with good reviews. After couple of months of light usage, it is not worth it.Pros: 1) Only fully featured eliptical trainer in less then $1000.Cons: 1) Tooo noisy, the noise is increasing day by day. I don't know of any way to reduce the noise. To get an idea how noisy it is, I am unable to excersice in morning without disturbing neighbors in my apt. complex.My word of advise: Don't but it if you live in shared housing or an apartment complex."
5,a book for generations to come,"It is rare that many young people ever get the chance to hear about the early life of some of the most successful business people. SWIMMING ACROSS is one the most educational and enlightening accounts of Andy Grove's life. It is a story that I intend to pass down to my future generations. Too many accounts of the lives of business people focus on the profits and losses they made or mergers and acquisitions. Andy Grove shares his early life experiences that shaped his destiny. The challenge to start from below ground level and rise to the very top proves that anyone who does not have the resources to succeed can learn to leverage themselves to achieve goals that benefit everyone. This book is should be brought into classrooms and boardrooms. Terrific READ. Too bad Amazon's maximum star limit is 5. :-) Read, learn and enjoy."
4,get the UK version of the reissue,"This same album is available at amazon.co.uk for normal, a low CD price, so go over there and get it! I'll be honest here. The first Kinks album is not a great album. If they had never recorded anything else then the group would be remembered only by ""You Really Got Me"", ""Stop Your Sobbing"" (only because it was covered by the Pretenders) and ""All Day and All of the Night"" which isn't even on the first album. HOWEVER and this is big... the Castle/Sanctuary reissue has 12 bonus tracks for a total of 26 tracks, containing lots of non-album single tracks which are WAY better than the album tracks. Among these include ""All Day and All of the Night"" and many others. So, I suggest buying it because you get a CD's worth of great songs and the original album, which if nothing else has a few good songs in the Beatles/Stones vein and is good for historical perspective."
5,Wonderful Toy Chest,"I would recommend this toy chest to anyone. My daughter finds it very functional to see the toys so she can select them, and I love the wheels on it. We can push it out of her room during nap time to keep the distractions to a minimum. The only downfall is my daughter loves to climb in it (not the fault of the manufacture); however I do have to say it holds up very well for that function. Great product!!!"
2,Disappointing Compared To Tanenbaum's Other Books,"After reading almost all of Tanenbaum's books, Corruption Of Blood does not deliver the suspense and plot twists that I've come to expect. The plot was too contrived and, not surprisingly given the subject matter (the JFK assassination), leaves you dangling and feeling unsatisfied."
4,2xist V-neck T-shirt,"These shirts feel really nice, have a slim cut and it's great to have them in black. The only thing is that they shrink A LOT! I bought them to wear under a uniform where I tuck my shirt in. They are still tuck-able, so it's fine. But they didn't stay super long. Maybe one size up would be better."
4,better than the first,"My boys, 5 and 8, loved the first game and badgered me to get this one. They were not disappointed. Even I can tell that the graphics are better, and the courses are more sophisticated and exotic. They cracked up when the guy lost his car and had to start running. The 2 boys could also cooperate in the game, which is great. If you don't mind the fact that it is, afterall, just another racing game, you should get it if your kids are this age. I think it is great for ""little"" racers. At least they could tell that Lego world is not like the real world. My son asked me if people drive like that in the real world......."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK,"Oh, that sounds harsh, & that's not what I mean.I've just had a chance to review this book, & I already own Williams's ""Publishing Your Own Magazine, Guidebook, or Weekly Newspaper,"" & I feel that the latter is far-&-away the better book, not to mention cheaper. Call it a prejudice, but I really feel you'd be better served by reading the other one, despite its quirks -- Williams can get a little scattered at times, but he speaks from personal experience, & I've found him not only inspiring but informative."
5,my kitty & I love this feeder!,"I have only the best things to say about the CatMate 50 feeder. My cat Casey has a very delicate tummy - dry food makes him throw up, so I only give him canned. But 5 months ago I started being away a few nights a week, & didn't know how I was going to handle his food. Thought I'd have to have someone come by to feed him, but then I discovered CatMate, & it saved me! When I leave, I set it up for 3 meals. When I come home, all meals are eaten & Casey is happy. Took a few minutes to program it the first time, but now it's easy, takes a second. And Casey didn't have any problems eating from it (I watched the first few times to make sure...) The food compartments are a good size, & the dish with the compartments is very easy to clean. It's well-constructed & has been completely reliable. Animate customer service was great when I had a question at the beginning. Highly recommend!"
2,Impressions of Plastics:Materials and Processing 3rd Edition (Paper Back),"The paperback version appears to be a photo-reproduction and not an original press run. The illustrations and photos are very poorly reproduced. The publisher should not be charging this outrageous price for such a shoddy reproduction. I'm sure the pictures and illustrations may have helped in presenting the information but most were so bad as to be more of a distraction than an aid. If this is a required text for a class try and find a hard bound copy. Hopefully the photos will be properly reproduced. As for the text itself, this book seems quite in need of a refresh for a publication date as recent as 2005."
4,Filled with shocking surprises!,"Courtney Marsh, adopted as a child, seems to have it all. What else could a beautiful successful woman possibly want? Miss Marsh wants to know who her real parents are. Against all discouragement this determined lady leaves New York and goes to East Hampton looking for the startling unbelievable truth. You won't get bored reading THE GOLDEN UNICORN. There are unexpected turns in this book that will keep you interested. Even though information about her adoption was meant to be kept a secret, throughout the whole book you learn new and exiting things about the past. Phyllis A. Whitney wrote an unpredictable book. I can't count the many times I thought I knew what was going to happen next, and was wrong. Filled with thoughts and emotion it kept me awake and wanting more."
3,Few Pictures,"The book had hundreds of pages of small text, but very few pictures. The way my wife and I travel, by playing it by ear, this isn't appropriate. I'm not going to sit and read all that. I want a few pictures of a town, a small map to go along with my other maps, and some good ideas of what is good in that particular town. I don't need 80 pages of documentation on it."
4,It will grow on you,"I actually did not like this game at first, but I'm growing to really like it. The secret, I think, is in learning to tweek it. After you select a car, you can adjust the breaks, tires, gears, steering, etc for your car. I found that making the steering more sensitive dramatically improved my enjoyment of the game. I went from thinking I had wasted 40 bucks, to a satisfied customer. The only complaint I have is that you have to navigate through about 20 dialogue boxes before you can actually race. That's a bit much. But otherwise, it's a truly fun ride."
2,"Great strap, but cheap buckles","I loved every aspect of this strap until one of the plastic buckles broke and dumped my 20d on the asphalt. ouch!! I just replaced it with the Op/Tech pro loop strap, which has much more subtantial buckles. The Op/Tech seems to be a much better strap for 10 bucks less."
1,Very disappointed,"My son wanted this game and was so excited to buy it with his own money. It did not work on any of the three computers in our home, that all met the requirements for the game. We tried quite a few times to reach the tech support on the package and got no reply. Very disappointed."
4,Great information,I found that it had a lot of information and great colored photos to help with identification. Glad I got the book.
1,Save Your Money,If you really want to understand and prepare for a commercial lease negotiation consider:The Commercial Lease Guidebook: Learn How to Win the Leasing Game! (Paperback) by Thomas G. Mitchell
1,Buggy!,Really disappointed in this one! I could not get the game to workproperly. My new PC(WindowsME)locked up 4 times! After I installed and reinstalled several times I called the Lego tech line but they were unable to suggest anything beyond the usual installation guidelines and seemed unaware of any bugs. I've really enjoyed some of the other Lego titles and it's a shame that they appear to have rushed this one out in order to coincide with the movies' release.
2,Don't Get this over Castlevania or Tony Hawk,"This game resembles Mario Party in a few ways. It is made up of minigames mostly, with poor graphics and sound. The story line of this games is that Tweety has developed a petrification curse, and Granny needs to collect the 5 Magic Gems to save him. The rest of the Looney Toons decide to compete against each other and try to get the Gems themselves. This game would be OK, if the board game and minigame features had not already been taken. You move by drawing cards, and you can trigger random effects by land on certain places.The main bad thing about this game is that it is too complicated for a kids game; Having 16 minigames, 50 different items, and over 200 spaces, it takes more than an hour to play a game of nonsaving action. This game should not be bought at all, as it is simply boring."
2,The stupid computer....,"WEll, I thought this game would be cool because it was like a Mario Party, but boy was I wrong! The Mini games are ok, but the actual game bites! The computer cheats like mad even in Easy Mode and plus the board is so impossible. THere are so many dead ends and many of the roads you have to take take forever. Plus, you have to watch the computer move and it takes forever. Do yourselves a favor: go get something good like Bomber Tournament or F-Zero. They are soo much better and cheaper (I THink)."
4,Great and Informative!,"Really enjoyed this book. It was quick and to the point. Easy to read and very informative. I will be reading others from Jacob Abbott. I'm not big on the ""fluff"" in some of the historical stories, so this was a nice change."
3,Now what I thought,"It's okay but is a little strange how it changes from present to past tense. Also, I downloaded this on my kindle and seems to have pictures/graphs that are described but that don't show up."
3,"Lack suspense, rather forgettable","""The Ropemaker"" is a young adult fantasy novel. This fantasy world had some unique customs and interesting reasons for having them, but the author spent more time on travelogue than world-building details. The characters had some depth, but they weren't really fleshed out. Yet they were engaging enough that I wanted them to succeed.Unfortunately, I felt it lacked suspense. The few exciting scenes were over quickly. We're told they were a struggle for the characters, but the description of the struggle made it seem simple. The characters also always knew exactly how to handle each situation that came up, and they choose the exact right way to handle it. While things didn't always go exactly as planned, they never actually failed.There was a very minor amount of ""he cursed"" style of bad language. There was no sex. There was some fantasy magic and magical creatures. Overall, I found the story rather forgettable and unexciting, but it's not a bad story."
3,"More entertaining, still meandering...","One of the more entertaining Oz books, but still very meandering. The story is mostly an excuse to introduce the reader to more strange and wonderful characters living in and around Oz. Descriptive and fantastical, but short on plot."
2,Informative but lame,"This book is informative enough about Earnhardt but is written on a third grade reading level. I'm an Earnhardt fan but found the readability of the book to be pathetic. Of course, I guess the author was writing to his audience."
2,"Very Cute, but Parts Are Too Hard for Kids","This game is really quite cute. There is a great deal of imagination behind the design of the different levels, but some of the ""boss battles"" at the end of levels are just too hard for kids. Having to do 5 or 6 different key combinations SIX different times under a time limit is just too much to ask."
5,Excellent resource for parents with adult children at home.,"Using ToughLove concepts in a gentle manner, this book is a great read for parents with adult children still living at home. Help your adult child become independent and enjoy the rewards of successfull parenting and your own freedom"
4,GREAT book,"This books is EXACTLY what I needed. Specific information, and concepts to think about. I learned a lot about myself as well as how to deal with the adult adolescent. I highly recommend this book."
5,Couldn't put it down!,"I enjoyed this fast paced romance mystery. I found the old version of this in a used book store and now see that it is to be rereleased. Try it, you won't be disappointed. Ann Naxwell (AKA E. Lowell) knows how to write a love scene! I haven't read one of her books in a while and after reading many other romance authors I am reminded of why she was instantly one of my favorites!! She writes chapters in such a way that you can't put the book down, something always happens to keep you reading on into the wee hours of the night. This story was interesting historically, had a good romance and presented a tense scenario of intrigue and danger. Enjoy!"
4,Granddaughter Loves It!,"20 month old granddaughter really likes to look at this book. Hopefully, it will aid in future potty training."
5,Gentle Introduction for Parent and Child,"I read this book to my daughter for the first time last night. She pointed to all the pictures, and acknowledged the meaning/purpose of each. She's just starting to ""train"" and she is very reluctant to try at home. She's being ""pushed"" at preschool, and I think that this is adding to her reluctance. The reason I selected this book over countless others is because it has easy to read and understand copy and the illustrations are sweet without being ""cartoony"" or too grownup. I feel very sure that this book will help us both."
3,This product didn't agree with me!,"Anyone who questions the potency of supplements needs to take this product. I took this product maybe 5 days (at night) and the whole next day I felt drugged up. I sort of liked the feeling, but then my legs started to lock up and that is an effect I definitely don't want. I also started to feel weak and like I was going to pass out. I only took one pill a night, but clearly this particular product's potency is too much for my body."
5,"Five Iron Frenzy, Electric Boogaloo","This album exposes a new side of FIF with each track. The first song, ""Pre-Ex Girlfriend,"" has an upbeat feel, while the lyrics describe the singer's unattainable love interest. Later, the track titled ""The Day We Killed,"" is a political protest song with a hardcore edge to it. FIF slows it down at the end with ""Eulogy,"" which is a nice ending to the album both in lyrics and melody. This CD is a great listen, whether you're doing homework, working out, or just hanging out."
4,Spotlight On Radio Days,"As a mystery reader, I found the going very difficult. The main concentration is on the preparation and presentation of radio shows, and the detail to this end is quite deep. If you were interested in the workings of early radio show then I think you would find this book to be compulsive reading.Due to the great detail provided in describing the radio side of the story, something had to be neglected and in this case it turned out to be the mystery. Any progress made by Jordan Ten Eyck / Jack Dulaney in solving the disappearance of two men was made with wild hunches based on very little evidence which always happened to yield results. I found this ""luck"" very unlikely and found myself growing increasingly frustrated with that aspect of the story. Rather than expecting a mystery, expect a story of the day to day running of a radio studio and it's importance to the cultural growth of America during the Second World War."
3,lower level!,"i don't think ele has reached a higher level with producing this cd. it is definitly not as good as log on and ele's coming 4 u.u can't compare it with these two, the beatz aren't that good, often even too nervous and almost similar to others on the same album. actually it's still a good dancehall cd, but you don't find these typical elephant man anthems (like ""elephant man"", ""e-l-e-p-h-a-n-t"", ""shizzle my nizzle"", ""log on"", ""jamaica"" etc.), exept ""manabadman"" and maybe ""ele message"" ... on the other ele-albums there were so many songs that u loved when u first heard em, but on higher level i don't feel like that. so i'm a bit disappointed, cause i expected something else. perhaps i hav 2 hear it (over) again, but my first impression is that i don't like it that much an that i can't see ele's higher level."
2,disappointed...,"I only bought this book because of the rave reviews I saw for it. I'm not even half way thru this book and I'm already regreting buying it. I came back here to warn others away, when low and behold (after I buy the book...), I see horrible reviews for it. This book was obviously written by a first time author and maybe later on he'll write great books, but this isn't one of them. The actual storyline/plot is great but the story-telling is done horribly. One of my major pet peeves in a book is a bad job of editing. I lost interest when right off the bat, I saw typo city. Anyway, I could go on and on but I'd just be repeating Ken's review. He hit it all right on the nose. DON'T BUY THIS BOOK"
4,"So far, so good","This pump is replacing another exactly like it that failed after less than two years. It has a three year warranty; however, I did not have purchase documentation for failed pump. Will keep it for this one."
4,This Is No Ordinary Book On Make Money!,"* When I first read this book, I was totally amazed on how much mistakes that I have done concerning my job.* You will look on more different ways to stay ahead and be control for your financial income.* I have more fun in life now as I manage to change my thinking of making money, thanks to the tips given in this book."
1,"Don't Worry, I'm Sleepy","I kept reading faster and faster just to get it over with. His style mimicks Harvey Mackay, but falls far short of his success."
1,Dull,"Recommended by Newsweek magazine, this book was picked for one of my book clubs. I almost put it down at least 10 times and only skimmed through the last half of the book because of ""Book Club Guilt"". Of the 6 or so characters in the book, only 1 was amusing and clever - and she only appears on about 10 pages."
4,Up to the usual standard,"If you're already a C S Forester and a Horatio fan, you will enjoy this well researched, well written set of 3 novels depicting the fictional life of Horatio Hornblower after he had been promoted to Captain R.N. The action is ripping and the books hard to put down. However there is a preponderance of battles with none of the blood and gore spared. I find this a little dispiriting but acknowledge it was part of a warlike time in history. My disappointment also runs to the lack of satisfactory conclusion to each novel and the omnibus. However that makes it worthwhile getting the next parts of the series. If I was reading one of the novels in isolation I would find the ending quite disappointing. I will soon start the next trilogy with anticipation of a good read."
3,When is a Kindle version of Captain Hornblower releasing?,"I notice that one of the reviews for this book was for a kindle version but that the digitising process was poor. I presume Amazon withdrew that version until a good digitising process could be put in place. It is now over 9 months since that review and still no sign of a Kindle Captain Hornblower. Any news?The other two ""omnibus"" Hornblower editions (Admiral Hornblower and Young Hornblower) are available in Kindle format. I have bought them and they don't appear to have the digitising errors that this reviewer talked about."
2,TV Wall Mount,"In my opinon, this wall mount is not strong enough for a 46"" TV, especially if you made a big investment in your TV!"
1,Boring,I could not get into this book. The storyline was dull and so were the characters. Not recommended!
3,"Entertaining, but sooooooo predictable","One of the reasons I enjoy mysteries so much is that I absolutely suck at figuring them out. I am always surprised at the end. Not here; I knew what was going on and figured out the ending in every detail by page 60. I might retitle this book, ""Robin Cook Has a Mortgage Payment to Make."" I can't think of any other reason why he would besmirch his reputation by publishing this piece of trash. I'll admit it kept me entertained, but I kept feeling ripped off because I knew what was going to happen. If you are looking for a beach book it's fine, but don't expect literary genius here. In fact, don't expect much and you'll get it."
2,An alright camera.,"This camera is ok if you are just looking for a typical, average, not-so-special digital camera. It is not a good camera for photographing small up close items. For normal everyday photos of people or places, then this is a good camera for you. The 'zoom' feature only works if you have the resolution set to the highest it can go...which is only 3 options. You can have black & white, sephia, and colored photos. This camera does not like to photograph moving images. I have owned this camera for about 2 years now and its done the jobs needed to be done :] this camera can also record up to about 5 minutes of video, that can come in handy."
5,Great Choice,I think this selecton is a great relaxation piece. It is very soothing to listen to when doing just about anything!!! Great choice!
1,AWFUL!!,I can't believe ANYONE would sell this!! It was so sub par and smelled so bad that I threw it away. Don't order from this company because you will receive something that has been on a shelf for years.
2,Cannibals and Kings at The College Level?,"After having just read Cannibals and Kings, I am leary of my rating of this book. Im my opinion, i definately feel this book is challenging especially as a freshman attending college. The vocabulary was often advanced and difficult to understand, however the chapters were short which made reading easier to follow. In my opinion, the author clearly specified how life was in the past and how we can use the advancements from the past in the future. I was pleased with the ending where he gave suggestions to how to deal with certain issues today. Overall, I thought the book was rather confusing. The jargin was complicated and it took a while to comprehend what was being stated. Often times, I would have to read over the same paragraphs in order to understand the jist of it. The paragraphs constituted a type of domino effect, however, they didn't run smoothly. I recommend this book to upper class college students who are studying in a field related to history."
4,Lots of fun and good for you,"When is an array of vampires, elves, witches, Satanists and hoodoo doctors NOT a freak show? When they fall under the respectful, thoughtful gaze of Christine Wicker. What she has done for the spiritualists of ""Lily Dale: The True Story of the Town that Talks to the Dead"" she now does for a much wider cross-section of American spiritual culture.If you yourself are a magic-worker or ""alternative believer"" of any kind, you would do well to read this book. We all tend, like everybody else, to look down on people who walk our path in ""the wrong way."" I will never laugh at people who think they are elves again."
5,"The basics, expertly covered","Long-duration travel is a wonderful thing, but it can be awfully challenging too. You could muck around for a year or two and figure it out for yourself, but chances are your travels will be happier, cheaper, and slower (yes, slower) if you read this first.This is a comprehensive overview. It's not a detailed manual with exact specs for anything in particular. This book is for setting the stage, and giving you the tools to plan out what you want to do - there are copious links to internet and offline resources. It will steer you away from the common mistakes - too much stuff, too many kilometers, too shallow an expereince. Most importantly, it sets a tone for why people do this, and raises the bar for this expereince. Lansky is all about getting off the tourist trail and getting deep into a new place. This book will help you do it safely and respectfully."
2,Very very used,I know I bought the most used copy but the description still let to believe it was ok and it is completely falling apart. On the first day the entire first chapter fell out of the book.
1,Boring Busta,"Busta used to be so damn hype, but this album is pretty booty. False futuristic beats and Busta trying to sound like he's from the south. Why'd he have to get the worst MC to ever touch a mic, P Diddy, on there, too? Wack."
5,Excellent world percussion,"This is one of the few CDs available in the mass market that has any Udu (A.K.A. Ibo drum ) in it, being played by a master of the Udu. (See ""Brian Melick playing Udu drum "" @ youtube.com) The songs on this album are pure percussion. He uses a Drum set, chimes, shakers, Doumbeks, Djembe, Rattles, Tongue Drums, Congas, Cymbals, Udu drums (of course), and much more...This CD is a must for any true lover of good percussion. It has a very tribal sound to it, yet the sound engineering on it is superb."
4,Different,This is a great album...quite different than anything I have heard. Andrew Bird is an excellent song writer and musician. There is a great deal to appreciate from this album.
4,Great album from a rising star,"Heard his newest album, Noble Beast which was amazing and decided to see what else he had. This was definitely not a disappointment. The combination of whistling, guitar and violin is great."
5,better than...,"I'm disappointed that some people review this album, and others by Bird, and dock him a star because they didn't like the album as much as another Bird album they heard. Not fair! Bird's work, in my opinion, is better on his worse day than most artists on their best days. Let's face it, people hold Bird to a very high standard, and that speaks volumes about him as an artist. If this isn't a 5 star album, I don't know what is."
2,"Mush for Breakfast, Anyone?","I don't see how this artist can get 5 stars worth of anything. He is impossibly difficult to understand, unless you take the time, and follow along, word by word, his lyric sheet. Does the CD even come with one? It should be mandatory. Heaven knows, he may be gifted, but why try, is my question, when he sounds like he has the kitchen towel stuck between his teeth. Lovely. Must be some worthy reason he wants you to try so hard to follow along...I'm not buying it, and the CD either."
5,Very cute,"This book is very adorable. My son loves it, and the book is written to directly speak to your child. I can't wait to get the rest of the books in this series."
2,Boring.,"This didn't help my son potty train at all. In fact, I could hardly keep his attention while trying to read it to him. Its just boring. It might work for your child though, so it might be worth it to try."
1,Way too descriptive,"This was way over the top for us. I just think talking about it would be better. I was SO uncomfortable reading it. I know a lot of people liked it, I had to return it. It even had wiping in it, yikes!"
5,Great Book,"I just got this for my almost 3 yr old son who is always telling me ""no no potty mommy"". But he really enjoys the story and I don't mind reading it over and over and over. I think this is a good start for him and his potty."
5,Magic Kitchen,If you are a sucker for romantic comedies this is the one for you never a dull moment at all.
5,HAPPY CUSTOMER,"This necklace is very nice. I thought when I bought it, it would be too short on me, but i was so wrong. It looks absolutely gorgeous. Its such a classy look."
1,It's No Secret,No secrets were revealed!!! Don't buy this book if you're looking for insight into the world of Freemasonry... I was not informed!
2,Poor customer service,"I just got a working H10 yesterday. I ordered one in August. My 1st H10 didn't sync to my computer and the firmware didn't help. My second H10 couldn't even get to that point. It would freeze after turning on. I tried to talk to customer service, but I would get a busy signal and so I tried through e-mail and it took 3 weeks to get a response that I would get a response. When I did get a rep on the phone, they only could tell me how to update my firmware, when obviously that wasn't my issue. I did save money by buying a remanufactured H10, but I don't recommend it. If I had bought a new one it would've been around the same price as an iPod, which is what I should have gotten in the first place."
1,Only A DDP mark would enjoy this book,"If you are buying this book to read about the inner-workings of the wrestling business dont bother,If you are buying this book because you are a DDP mark then this is for you. This book is nothing but Page telling you how great he is and how everything he touches turns to gold,Page comes across as the savior of WCW ,while his friends continue to tell you the same thing. There are other very good wrestling books to read,dont bother with this one."
3,It was OK,"This book is okay. It all starts when Mrs. Jeepers tells her class that a new pizza place has opened called Jewwel's Pizza. Then Howie, Liza, Eddie and Melody hear strange dragon-like sounds from the kitchen. They think that George, the restraunt owner is St. George holding a dragon as slavery for cooking the pizza."
5,baron baptiste live,"Awesome workout. Three different ""classes"" to choose from & varying levels of ability demonstrated. A must for any yoga library."
3,Average starter receiver,"Mine did not come with the card. Call Direttv and they'll send you one for $20. I knew the service wasn't free. It's always been $5 per receiver per your contract. If all your rooms are wired, and it's convenient, you can move the receiver. It works fine."
4,The last reviewer is talking tosh.,"Last fella stated that I keep mine hidden & work is a four lettered are only available on this cd-single. Garbage.Reissue, Repackage, Revaluate....Both songs appeared on the Girlfriend In A Coma EP.Any true Smiths fan would have these in their collection albeit on vinyl.Look out for the Girlfriend EP.Sweet & Tender is a b-side to Sheila & appears on Louder Than Bombs.. the Warner definitive collection."
3,Some inspiration,"There are some good ideas in here for being prepared for entertaining. I also like the idea of trying to decorate and entertain with a vision that is ""outside of the box"". But, let's face it. Most of us do not have a life like Tracy Porter and her husband....not the money, not the resources, etc. It was fun to look anyhow. We can all wish."
5,"Fantastic film, but it can be got for cheaper...","...if you buy the book 'The Inner Journey: Views from the Gurdjieff Work', which includes the same DVD and sells for around $20. You get the film, a 380 page book with selections from Gurdieff's works, and save $10."
1,What the ..... ? a THREE MINUTE battery is not enough.,"I've owned the WR43, the WP10 and now the W30. I loved the first two. I especially loved the optical viewfinder. Did I mention that an action camera NEEEEEEEDDs an optical viewfinder?My first two met unfortunate demises, thus I sallied forth and got their successor.My only complaint, other than the lack of optical viewfinder, is that it has a three minute battery life. What was wrong with the old battery that lasted for several hundred pictures? I've bought new batteries and chargers in hopes that they were the problem. I'm close to sending it back from whence it came."
4,Excellent!!,The Pentax Optio W-30 was a great buy for the price. The different modes are very easy to access and use. Two thumbs up!
1,Trouble trouble trouble!,"We have had this camera for 4 years. In this time we have had to send it away for repair twice! It costs over 100$ to repair9first time was under warranty). We never used it underwater as that voids the warranty and if you read reviews, it does leak. It does take beautiful pictures, when it decides to take a picture! Often it takes so long to turn on that the moment has passed and if you do get it on and press the shutter button, it sometimes takes up to 5 seconds to take the picture! That's fine if the object isn't moving! Save your time and money and by a Canon. That's going to be my next camera. They have great customer support and a good product."
2,Screen retains water - can't see what picture you are taking,"I just got the camera 5 days ago and have used it on 2 different water occasions. Water gets behind the protection around the LCD screen so that you can't see what you are taking pictures of and view the pictures already taken. My camera has been out of the water for 12 hours now and water is still ""behind"" the screen. I don't know if mine is defective. I'm going to contact Pentax."
3,"Great as my first waterproof, but there are better.","This was the first waterproof camera I ever used, and I loved it! The flexibility of being able to take my camera into the water was great. The pentax is easy to use, takes decent pictures and I have never had any problems when using it for snorkeling, even for longer time periods than recommended. Since then, though, I purchased a waterproof Olympus and like the quality of the pictures better and the larger screen size is nice."
2,Fantasy Figures leave much to be desired,"When it comes to Schleich, Safari, Papo, and any other manufacturer of educationally directed figurines, you can generally find accurate and well painted toys based on real animals. However, it seems when the designers of these toys no longer have a living reference to look at they have no idea what to do. Their fantasy figures are very badly designed compared to the rest of their products. They could learn a few things from McFarlane toys, or at least hire some different designers for their fantasy series. To be fair, a child would probably enjoy this or any dragon toy no matter how broken its wings look. But for those of us who are older and still like having some cool, well painted desk toys, these don't hold up."
3,The Dragon that lost its wing - twice,"My daughters got this dragon for Christmas to go with their new castle. The wing broke off within 5 minutes of playing with it. We contacted the manufacturer and they sent out a replacement dragon the next day. We had that dragon for 2 days before the wing fell off. I'm surprised since I see all the other reviews saying how tough the dragon is. My girls are not very rough on their toys so I don't know what gives. I give up though, they are just happy playing with 2 dragons, winged or not."
3,Good band goes bland,"Bought this for the two non-album B-sides, but they were just lifeless versions of album cuts, not unreleased tracks, as Deacon Blue used to do."
4,Lavin's Laudable Laments,"If you have read Joe Lavin's Internet columns, this book will not be new to you. It will, however, remind you that Lavin who some may consider to be a Dave Barry genetic mutation is truly a columnist on the rise. And I'm not making this up!The fifty-four columns in ""but i digress"" are punched with Lavin's myopic brand of contemporary humor and weasel-biting prose that strips the flesh off of sacred cows and individuals (sometimes being one and the same). The book is a great read and serves to document events, happenings and headline grabbing individuals with a perspective not often considered rational...by normal thinking folks. The book is genuine Lavin. The book will be a collector's item.Would I recommend this book to others? Not only have I recommended it, but I have given the book to those who are serious about discovering new authors."
1,"A compelling premise, marred by shallow reasoning.","Rev. Carter's premise, that secret Old Testament prophecies foretold slavery and that racism is God's judgment against blacks, is compelling. However, his argument is ultimately an intellectually shallow, mean-spirited diatribe on everything that he sees wrong with African Americans today. At moments, Rev. Carter, himself an African American, comes across as a bitter racist. Of course, he has a right to his controversial opinions, but he should at least back them up with credible research and not hide behind questionable, subjective interpretations of Scripture as the primary evidence for his case."
4,Great food for thought (I don't totally agree.),"Whether you agree or not, all African Americans should read this book! There's still enough good in this book to work with. It is still a dangerous book in the hands of Eurocentric ""christians."" I couldn't even imagine him SPEAKING this book on tv.Nevertheless, he has some VALID points about contemporary Blacks' weaknesses and faults (sins). Other great books are by Nana Banchie Darwah, Fred K. C. Price, Kingsley Fletcher and Albert Raboteau."
4,Great,"This is a great CD. All of the songs are very good. Good vocals and good music in the backround. Nice lyrics, too. If you like alternative rock, buy this CD!"
2,Boring,"I bought this CD with high hopes, and I was disappointed with the results. It's all well-recorded and everything, but I don't feel a sense of purpose in many of the songs. I think that the leading single from the CD is probably the best track. It's too bad that a band like Unloco could put out such a mediocre disc."
2,stop after the first track,"I had been looking for the title song since I heard it sampled in a Wyclef song. ""Only A Fool"" is a cool song but everything else on here slick, over-produced & pretty week."
2,"Great Idea, Poor Design","I bought one to go on a Bob Stroller and while I love the concept the design does not work for me. The problem is in the mounting of the arm that picks up the pulse from the magnet on the wheel. The arm and it's method of mounting are not secure or rigid enough to consistently keep it close to the magnet for a prolonged period of time. The whole principle of how this unit works it that the sensor mounted near the wheel picks up a pulse from the magnet mounted on the inside of the wheel and sends a wireless signal to the digital control unit. When the sensor is too far away from the magnet, none of the features pertaining to distance or speed will work. It worked fine for it's maiden voyage and after that I have to readjust it every time I want to use it. To me it's not worth the money with if you have to fool with constantly."
2,Great idea...needs work,I thought this would be great when my wife told me about it. It turns out however that the surface you walk on needs to be as smooth as glass for this to even be kind of remotely accurate. The best accuracy I could achieve was it clocking 1.4 miles for each mile we walked...and that was after a long time of set up. I even used digital calipers to accurately measure the wheels of the stroller. The sensor that reads the magnet on the wheel is so bouncy that I'm not sure it will get a correct reading with the slightest bumps in the road.Would love to see the product improved.
3,God Catchers,"I really was looking forward to reading this after ""The God Chasers,"" but it could not compare. I find a lot of repetition in this book and although I'm reading (a lot slower than God Catchers) I could not recommend it like I would God Catchers."
5,Love this rug. Great color,This rug is a rich burgendy red color. It's a great accent color to my living room. Love this rug and would recommend it.
4,Better than Melvin Flynt,"This album was worth the wait, I remember hearing for months ""God's favorite on the way"" back in December, than in February, finally March, still no signs of it, after hearing June 25 off Nore's website, I ran out that day and copped it. God's favorite is more consistent than His last solo record Melvin Flint. There are a few throwaway tracks sprinkled in, but overall a pretty solid effort, I play it in my car deck all the time."
2,Not the old Noreaga,"Noreaga is one of my favourite rappers, But I feel he really fell of on this album. His previous two solo albums have been classics, but this was not impressive at all. Maybe its the chance to defjam, maybe its cuz I dont like the lead single. Noreaga isnt devling into new issues, and he isnt even providing basic entertaiment. Given that critisim their were still two tracks I felt that were nice ""Love ya Moms"" has alot of heart to it, and is a good song. And the last track by Capone, forgot the name, it was pretty ill too. Though both tracks are with Capone. Maybe Nore isnt as hungry anymore, maybe Im just not into atm, whatever it is, I still will check out his next album, and look forward to Capones upcoming debut album."
3,Some regiments given short shrift,Better check the Table of Contents before you sink a hundred bucks into this book. You may very well find that your favorite regiment isn't listed.Why?
2,Bogus Album,"This is not a real album......but a series of demos DONE for instruction purposes only, by Billy Griffin who produced a lot of English pop acts in the 1990s in London..."
4,Marbling,This marbling pack is great for anyone starting out. We used it in an early years classroom and the children were able to squeeze the ink into a water tray and watch what happened. We also got a lesson in on color mixing. We used regular construction paper with great results.
3,Lovely lead singer!,"This is a good collection - The Elgins have a fantastic lead singer in Yvonne Allen who has a wonderful, joyous voice, she's truly shining! There are several good songs to discover here - most are, however, kept in a retrospective mood, the 80s approach taken on the hook-loaded ""You Got Emotion"" and ""It's Sensational"" works better, and the result is indeed sensational, truly outstanding performances! Thank Motorcity for giving so many artists, underrated by Motown in the first place, a second chance to showcase their talent properly."
4,Excellent Text,This work covers a broad range of topics related to the life and culture of ancient Israel. Several other works have been written on the subject. In my opinion this is one of the best. It covers everthing from town planning to agriculture. All and all an excellent window into how an ancient people lived.
2,Not very good,This charger was so unreliable. It would reject a lot of batteries. I could never gauge if it was the battery or the charger. I got another cheaper charger and it charged them without a problem.
1,piece of C,"i bought this charger hoping for a good quality trouble free experience. it wouldn't charge my batteries. it kept flashing red after a few minutes of charging. i thought something was wrong with the batteries so i got new ones, and guess what,....same problem. so a decided to go back to my old charger and put this one in the garbaga bin..what a waste."
1,The most misleading album title ever?,As a showcase of their later work this is of mild novelty value but The Contours best? Don't make me laugh
2,exercise solutions,I have only gotten through several chapters in this book. I think the content is a little less dry than say take off in German by oxford press(which by the way is very good) and therefore I can read through the chapters more quickly. I do think that the solutions to the questions in this book should be correct however. There are numerous problems with the solutions. It seems this book was never proofed at all. In any case if you want to learn german I suggest you pass up this book.
3,Great for kids.,"Got them for my neice and nephew, but I have M.S. so we couldnt play much longer with them. Loved the cards!"
4,Too bad it's currently unavailable,"I didn't read this until I was two or three years from graduating from prep school, but it is quite funny and somewhat true to life, even though it was probably written for a late '70s or early '80s audience. The book is written in the tongue-in-cheek style of other such tomes as Growing Up Catholic. Read it for the humor value and try not to take it too seriously."
1,NEVER RECEIVED item,I never received this item. It has been over a month and still have not received my CD!!!! Definately not professional
1,AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE!!!,"i havnt read the whole book, just page 6 (on this site) which was filled with numerous spelling mistakes, made up words (that have no meaning, even in context they make no sence) and basic writing mistakes. it shows that this author has no respect for the reader as it cant have been even slightly edited from the original version."
5,Great Gift,I bought these for my nephew as a birthday present and he absolutely loved it. He has a number of other sets bu was very excited with the content in this one. They were exactly what he wanted.
1,Avoid SOE online games at all costs,"This is the worst outfit around in the MMOG world, and that is saying something.From game design, to playability, to long term appeal, their games are bottom of the barrel.And regarding customer service - forget about it! You are just a dollar figure to them, they don't give a you-know-what about anything else like improving their products or listening to feedback from their customers and making appropriate changes.For an example, go to the Sony station forums for Everquest 2. There you will see a section titled ""The Glass House"" (the title alone is a dead giveaway of SOE's attitude towards their customers), where customers who complain about EQ 2 threads are all locked and sent. This gives you an idea of what SOE thinks of their customers. If you don't love their game and act like a sycophant and praise every boneheaded decision they make, you are persona non grata.EQ 2 continues Sony Online Entertainment's abysmal track record."
1,Read informed reviews. Not fanboy stuff,I was very interested in EQII until SOE started their bait and switch tactics. Promises were made that are not going to be delivered upon.(...)If you like to solo in these games just to avoid the boredom while waiting for a group then don't buy EQ2. You have to wade your way through tons of group content before you can find creatures that are suitable for soloing....
2,"Cute, but that's about it!","This phone is really cute. But its so hard to use, it doesn't matter! You have to put the phone on key lock, otherwise it will easily go onto the internet if you leave it in your bag. In order to turn the volume down or off you have to go through settings, there is no quicker way. While talking, the phone goes in and out and makes it hard to hear (even when there is full service). Basically the phone is super cute, but is so hard to use it is not worth it, even if its free! I will say that Cingular/ATT's service is really good! I have not been anywhere where I don't have service yet, and I've owned it a month!"
5,Un f-ing believable,"I would give it 10 stars. It is essentially Volcano but stripped down to its basic elements. I agree with the above review in that you don't need blasts in every song to make it heavy...and it is HEAVY!!! Every song is a winner. They trimmed off the fat and left only what was probably the best of the best riffs. Even though Frost isn't playing as fast as humanly possible this time out, he makes up for it ten-fold by playing really really catchy beats. Wait, no, creative beats. This whole album is so creative and new that I find myself writing a lot of riffs in this style. Don't hesitate, go get it today!"
1,Olympia Tango Phone - Cute but Poor Quality,"This phone has the absolute WORST sound quality of any cordless phone I've ever used. There is static and feedback. You can even hear an echo of your own voice back through the ear piece.On the plus side, the phone is really cool looking. The lights on it and the color are what drew me to it. I just knew that this was the phone for my daughter. I had high hopes for it as it matched my daughters new room really well. Even she doesn't like talking on it.When an 8 year old can tell the sound quality is too bad to bother with, you know it is bad."
1,A Terrible Book for an Introductory Stats Course,"The two reviews before this one do a very good job of highlighting the shortcomings of this book.It is a very difficult text to follow. For a book whose objective is to explain statistical concepts to someone without previous advanced math or statistics experience, it fails miserably. I used this book for an introductory statistics course having already taken 3 semesters of calculus. Despite my background, I found it difficult to follow and found myself often going to 3rd party sources to learn the concepts. The book was simply a waste of money."
5,Best pickup upgrade for a tele.,"I cant say anything bad about this pick up. It sounds so good! It makes me want to constantly play my guitar just to hear the tone of it. Best neck tele pick up by far. it is a very versatile pickup, Perfect for blues, chicken pickin country, funk, even jazz! Just roll off some highs with your tone control and you can achieve a pretty convincing hollow body jazz guitar sound. I've installed this pickup to a 2011 american standard tele. I paired the twang king neck with the dimarzio chopper t in the bridge just cuz i like richie kotzen's tone. Boy im so glad i did that cuz what a difference it made to my telecaster. Richie kotzen knows good tone. It sounds so good! I even went further to copy richie kotzen wiring the bridge and neck pickups in series with a push pull pot. The twang king in the neck in series with the chopper gave my tele a hot mid boost. perfect for leads! Awesome pickups."
3,Would be better if all the songs were on the CD,"I have only one complaint about this CD. Not all the songs are on it from the movie! My favorite song, ""Pour Some Sugar on Me"" by Def Leppard is not there, along with some other good songs. The CD has only 12 tracks, they could have easily fit five more on there."
4,a change,"Although I've never been a LeAnn Rimes fan, she does an excellent randition of the movies songs."
2,"Bah, where'd the songs go?!?","I'm not the biggest fan of Leann Rimes but I did enjoy 'Can't Fight the Moonlight'. The movie, however, struck me as just a chance to get cute girls in tight clothes and Leann Rimes more publicity. The music was -great- but they didn't include half of the good stuff on this CD. What I want, what I CRAVE and cannot seem to find is the version of 'Lodi Dodi' they used. Remember when Piper composed 'Right Kind of Wrong'? The fellow across the street was listening to a remake of Snoop's ""Lodi Dodi"" and I have searched high and low for it. Ah if only they had included it on here.."
3,Decent enough for a decent movie...,"This movie has nothing really deep and wonderful to deliver except what movie's should deliver. And that's entertainment. It's pretty much similar with the soundtrack recordings. Just by the cover of the soundtrack, it's easy to tell that girl bar tenders who dance on tables need danceable music. Even though I don't dance, after listening to this album, I'd much prefer dancing to better music (perhaps Bjork, No Doubt, heck even Britney Spears). The three stars are for the four new pop songs from Leann Rimes. It's understandable that she's now getting tons of airplay on hit radio stations."
5,"LeAnn Rimes makes the Coyote Ugly soundtrack a ""Big Deal""","With 4 songs by LeAnn Rimes, she sure takes over the cd with her new pop sound. As a country songbird this soundtrack has opened some doors to her. Her fans are very suprised about how her sound has changed. With a cameo appearance in the ""Coyote Ugly"" movie, her fans will get a taste of what leann has wanted to get a chance to do which is acting. With other artists, such as, Don Henley, The Charlie Daniels Band and other awesome artists, this soundtrack is going to be big with lots of #1's on it's way."
4,Great CD,"On Saturday 8/5, I went to the movie theater in Century City, CA to see this movie. When it was over, I went right next door to the music store and bought this CD. It is a great CD for LeAnn Rimes fans, as well as people who simply like music. It is definately a great CD to buy, put the top of your car down and just drive around listening to."
5,"EXCELLENT ""LIFE SAVING"" INFORMATION","If you want to really lose weight and increase your energy, buy this book. I went from a 33 waist to 30/31 in about 2-3 months. I now have more energy than I did as a teenager, it's great. I no longer get migraines, which I used to get every week. I don't know Dr. Broer from Adam, but I know one thing. His information and research has helped my family be and stay fit.Gil"
2,SAVE YOUR MONEY,"Author should stick to motivational speaking. Scattered throughtout his book is the notice to ""Call my office - 800...."" to order something else he is selling. He has plenty of items in the back that you can order and the 800 number is there. Isn't that enough? His book may have useful information, but you feel you are in front of a ""snake oil"" salesman and much of what he says has been around in other books at one time or another."
3,Not Like it Used To Be,"I have used the Renac for many years and was completely happy and dependent on it. This new product, the Stylenac, does not seem to heat up as hot as the prior product. The specs read the same but I don't think they are. It still works just okay but I definitely need the heat to style my hair. I'm just a little disappointed. Why do companies have to change an already good thing? The new color is cool but I wouldn't change it for the heat. Please return to the former product."
1,Piece of junk!!,Used renac for years and years. Each brush lasted 2-3 years each. this one wobbled as soon as it cameout of the box and the screws came out within a week. The brush was hot enough. It seared my hand as it fell apart. Shame on Renac for selling out to Chinese workmanship and lowering its quality while keeping the price the same. You have shown your true colors.
3,No cheap LCD monitor is perfect - But this one isn't bad!,"Well the title says it all... No cheap LCD monitor is perfect - But this one isn't bad! The price was right and it is a nice looking monitor. The only problem we have is that it arrived with 1 pixel out (right in the center of the screen too). We chose not to return it (who knows, we could end up with one much worse - I've seen some with 4-5 dead pixels!) Anyway, it has nice crisp text and color and is much nicer and clearer than the Envision LCD monitor we have. Setup was also easy under Windows 2000."
1,Don't Bother,"I wish I had read the reviews before buying as they are 100% right about the uselessnes of this item. You might as well print the picture off the web on a piece of paper and pin it up, as at least it will be accurate some day!!The dials are off at least 20 degrees when compared to other instruments and even placed next to a humidifier creates no visible change in the readings. Unfortunately the cost of the unit isn't worth the shipping to get it fixed. Absolute waste of time and money, I'm off now to drop mine into the trash."
4,Underrated,"I would have given this 5 stars but the two tracks on here were totally [bad] so I have to minus some cool points and minus mad cool points for the young kid who wrote lam. You kids will give a guy 5 stars when he is just yelling into the mic and ""mmmmmm"".Sorry, that not rap music that is a heist. Back the the new De La Soul it's got mad tracks on and I think it's one of the top hip hop allbums out right now. ..."
5,Amazing,"John Williams scores again! This CD is just fabulous and so powerful. Although it seems like most people don't like the song ""For Always"", I find it quite pleasing to the ear if you don't listen to it more than 10 times. Track number 12 really brings back memories from the movies finale and brought me to tears the first time I listened to it. This is a CD that needs to be bought AFTER seeing the show to be fully appreciated."
4,Great Pictures,We got this book so that we would know what we were catching and how well it ate. Great pictures. Only problem is knowing where to start looking without having to search the whole book...
3,Not so sure yet,I bought this with a day care grant. My youngest baby is 10 mo old and 22 lb. He really does not need to be in a front carrier anymore - but if he needed to be- this one really hurts my back. I picked a better carrier thinking it would save my back in child care. It feels very uncomfortable. Maybe with a lighter baby it will not be uncomfortable.
4,Baby Bjorn,"This product works better if your baby is a little older, when he is too young his head bounced around alot and so you have to use one hand to support it.Now he is 4 months and likes to be in it facing out."
1,Can you believe it's made in China???,"This is my second Bjorn. I can't believe I thought this was a Swedish product. Talk about false advertising. My poor baby has licked so much of this....how awful! We have really tried to rid our home of made in China baby products. It's not easy.I think it's really shameful that Bjorn pretends it's a Swedish product. Imagine the fat margins on this product!! It's about the same price it was 10 years ago when it was made in Sweden.By the way, my son is 18 lbs and after 20 minutes or so, this carrier hurts."
2,Do not buy it!,"We used the carrier only as long as the baby was under approx. 6 kg, and even in that time it was not really confortable. When our son got bigger we was hanging to low in the carrier, almost up to our knies, and for us it was very painful to carry him because of a presure on our shoulders. Besides, it is not healty for the baby to be carried like that: in the babybjörn the baby is not sitting properly, the hips are not at the 90degrees angle, how they should be, but the legs are hanging almost straight down, which is really bad! And it is even worse for the hipps to carry the child looking in front, I just do not understand why people are still doing it! Do not buy a babybjörn, there are some much better products than that carrier, like e.g. from ErgoBaby - we are still carrying our son in it for hours and he weights 12kg now!"
2,Definitely not for me,"This is the ONLY item I actually bought when I was pregnant, as opposed to receiving it as a gift. I thought it was a must-have, and the best of the best, so I spent $119 on it. It was ok while my baby was just weeks old, but once he was 10 and 12 pounds, I couldn't walk more than a couple blocks without very bad lower back pain. I'm average weight and height, but this carrier was very painful.My husband wears it occasionally because the baby can face forward, which the baby loves, but I don't wear it any more. I bought another model that places more weight on your hips."
3,"Nice carrier, but painful back...","I like this carrier because it allows me to carry around my son. But after a while, my back starts to really ache. It aches right in the mid-section, and my baby only weighs about 10 pounds. (Maybe I'm not the right person to just because I just had him and I haven't been able to work out...)But it is a great way to carry the baby around during walks, trips out and around the house."
3,Good product but I think I got display item,"When I got the product, both box and product packaging were not properly taped. It looked like this was a display or return item that somebody didn't know how to put back into its original packaging. I like the product. I think it's great but I wish I got a brand new item."
1,Not for the petite woman,"I purchased this carrier and found that once I returned to my pre-baby size it didn't fit. I am 5ft and have a slight build. I am not able to pull the straps tight enough to feel that my son is secure. I am now on my third carrier and it seems to fit perfectly (The Ergo carrier original works, Red Castle Sport is also too big). If you want to purchase this make sure you try it on and put a real baby into it."
3,Mediocre Performance,"The only one song I liked was Melodramma. Andrea Bocelli's voice was ok, but a bit too thin on the high notes. I believe that Andrea Bocelli was very successfully marketed, but I prefer Josh Groban. Groban's had a deeper and richer voice."
5,THE MOST BEAUTIFUL VOICE IN THE WORLD,"Of all the CDs by Bocelli, this is the most original, and I think his most passionate POP music so far. The orchestrations are beautiful, and his voice makes this CD, for me, a Five star production."
2,Cieli di Toscana,First of all the sound is terrible. I have a Bose radio and kept turning it up to get some impact in the music. I thought this was his worse CD I've bought so far. Who ever produced this did a terrible job. It doesn't have any sensationlism. Very disapointed in this CD.
1,Toscana,"What a disappointment! Absolutely stultfying compositions- so uninspiring that from the first song I was yawning . Half the time he sounds like an untrained singer, sliding up to reach his note, and half the time he's flat. The worst part is that he inspires no EMOTION! He walks through his songs. He is VERY overrated!!"
5,Toscana is wonderful!,"I have all of Andrea Bocelli's CD's and love this one. I bought it the first day out, and each time I play it...it just gets better! It is the best since Sogno!"
2,Sadly Thin in Sound and Content!,"I drove over 50 miles to get this CD on the day it was issued, such was my exictement about a new Bocelli work!! I am SO very disappointed in his effort to produce a match for his Sogno and Romanza music. This work is thin in production and on many cuts his voice seems stretched to it's limit. Although there are a few songs I enjoy, I find overall that I am vastly disappointed in what is considered an effort of two years to produce. Had this been the first CD of his I were to buy, I would surely not purchase any others. SO, for those of you contemplating a piece of work by this incredible performer, please purchase Sogno, or Romanza to hear the true talent and wonder of this amazing man."
4,kid loves it,My kid loves snuggling with it. She likes chewing on the legs and the snout. Just beware that it pills after washings.
4,Make mine a double,"Behind Bars is a trip. It's an almost anthropological look at the bar scene, mixed with only-in-New York stories and gossip. Like a great Woody Allen movie or episode of Sex and the City, it makes New York a character. All that plus drink recipes in every chapter."
5,Fun for all ages!!,"I have 3 children ages 5, 9 & 23. Santa left these under the tree and they all three LOVE THEM--They played with these all day on Christmas Day--even though that had lots of other new things to play with. It has a ""red laser"" light to highlight their target--so even when they were not shooting, they would have fun shining the target light. Make sure you buy extra 3 inch Micro Dart Packs--they lose darts and some of the darts eventually break. I'm going to buy this Nerf toy as birthday party gifts. I highly recommend this Nerf gun toy!!!"
3,No instructions?,"Nice looking piece, seems to be of good quality. But it is a fairly complicated install, and they provided no instructions. Maybe it was an omission, but Weber asks premium money for its products, I expect premium parts and service."
5,It will change your life....I promise,"I never thought I would make reading the bible part of my daily life. But by grace I bought this life changing bible and this is what made all the difference., It is easy to read, well explained and it does not contain difficult grammar or language. It is the perfect bible for those people who want to have God as an active part of their lives. I am very thakful to HIm for helping me find this bible...because it has changed my life and the lives of a lot of people that suround me. Make sure you get it so that it can change your life too."
1,New American Catholic Bible/Navy Blue Imitation Leather,"This Bible was not properly described online. When received, I realized this Bible was not what I needed, mainly because Amazon did not describe it thoroughly as they did with their other bibles. When I tried to return it to sender, they said I would have to pay shipping and stocking costs. I felt this was a bit unfair since Amazon's description was poor."
1,Only buy this book if you want to be a homemaker your whole life,"Although most of what he says is Biblically founded, he takes a very chauvinistic view of women and the household. If you are content just being a homemaker and agree that women should not have jobs outside the house, or are threatened by a woman earning more money than a man, than perhaps this is the right book for you.As for me, I'm going to use my talents and gifts in the work force as well as the home, because a true woman can handle both."
4,Works as advertised,"I bought 3 of these kittens along with a 4th one that I gifted.They are great and work as advertised. My only complaint, and it is more of a suggestion, is that they increase the horspower suction so that it picks up larger items at the first pass.Happy Sweeping!Jacques in Santa Barbara, CA"
5,A MUST HAVE!,"This little machine is GREAT! Between my kids going in and out all day and then the dog doing the same, I don't have as much work cleaning up after them as I used to. I keep it by the back door, make a daily sweep and my floors are always clean! Even the kids AND my husband have noticed how EASY it is to keep a clean floor and have begun to help out. I LOVE this little machine and am thrilled with the purchase."
3,"Effortlessly glides by, effortlessly forgotten","From cutting-edge to middle-of-the-road in 15 ""short"" years, Prefab Sprout have grown up along with their audience. ""The Gunman and Other Stories"" is unabashedly an adult album that does little to challenge the mind or the soul.That said, the melodies are harmful enough, and the 8-minute title track is actually rather good. But you won't find yourself humming the melodies an hour after you've heard them.Minus one star just for the absolutely horrid final track. What on earth was Paddy thinking?Worth the import purchase price for Sprout completists; the rest of you might want to think twice."
4,PEERLESS,"Paddy McAloon is one of popular music's most underrated songwriters. Thank God that has never prevented him from producing one gem after another; this album is no exception.""When You Get to Know Me Better"" is a sly but beautiful delight."
3,"Good, but not great","I've been a Prefab Sprout fan ever since Swoon. Although they have never topped Steve McQueen and Jordan I always end up buying their new albums. As is the case with their latest. It's better than Andromeda Heights but still not made of the stuff that earlier work was made of. It sounds a bit like the potential is a lot bigger, but it just won't take off. I'm still waiting for the next GREAT PS album...I guess I'll just keep up buying everything they release and hope to strike gold."
1,disappointing,"I followed Prefab Sprout from their debut ""Steve McQueen"" up to ""Andromeda Heights"", and somehow missed ""Gunman"", which on playing I wish I hadn't purchased. The lyrics--and PS's lyrics have always straddled a line between creative/heartfelt and just plain stupid/silly, goes full-tilt into the latter. Unlike previous albums, the sentiments are wholly maudlin, predictable and turgid. A big miss."
3,Group Exercises,"I bought this book for use with adolescent groups. I am a licensed clinical social worker will years of experience running groups with this population. I find that this book encompasses some exercises that I already had from other books. I also found some of the suggested topics to be thin on content. Overall, I think that this book is more appropriate for use by paraprofessional staff, or those with limited experience running groups."
4,Group Exercises,"Most of the exercises seem to be designed for adolescent groups. It would have been nice to know that before purchasing. However, many are adaptable to adult groups, and are quite useful."
5,Wow! It's like an igloo!,"My computer was idling at 61 degrees C until I added this heatsink and fans, now it stays at 40 or below at 100% processor use. Holy smokes, I'm a happy camper. The only problem I had was installing on the mobo, installation is easy but the size of this monster made clearing the ps a little challenging. I was able to work it out though and I love this thing. Thanks!"
1,Broke upon the first shot,"It is hard to review this product since it broke the first time it was fired. It looks tremendously nice, but since we never saw any flying crossbow bolts it is not something I can recommend at this time.We didn't return it since the price was so low and I didn't want to waste even 1/2 hour trying to work out an arrangement."
2,Handle with care,"My 8 yr old got this for Christmas. All I can say is, I have one very disappointed little boy.Two of the arrows broke on their first shots. Just the knobby part on the very end which inserts into the handle broke, so there is no way to use them as they do not click in.The crossbow itself seems to be constructed pretty well. I don't know if we will return this or look into getting replacement arrows, but I think exchanging the crossbow for a compound bow (which my older son has) would be the way to go (we've had no problems with that so far)."
2,broke within an hour,"This toy disappointed by breaking almost immediately. The hook that hold the arrow on place snapped off on one of them (I bought 2), and the top of the bows arms did not tighten evenly so it did not fire straight. I had read numerous reviews before chosing this model, but I guess they weren't as good as recommended. If you do buy this be VERY gentle."
4,Definitely written by teens......,"While it's good to see a teenager's side of situations and conversations, this book was pretty one-sided. This book addresses what a parent should say and how they should say it in order not to upset the teenager. When I was done with reading it, while getting some good pointers, I felt as though I would have to walk on eggshells with everything I said to my teen AND if they called me a ""bitch"" or a ""psycho"" I would have to ignore that and ask myself why I incited them or brought on this disrespect. Read this with a grain of salt, knowing that two high school teenagers wrote it. I commend them though for taking the tremendous amount of time and work to write this book. I just wish it would've addressed BOTH sides of the issue!"
3,Good but...,"This book is a wonderful book for anyone wanting to learn about the social issues in adult learning. However, although I realize this book is scholarly and widely used as a textbook for diversity courses, it is not written in succinct language in terms that someone with little teaching/training experience could understand."
1,THEY SAID IT WAS MADE TO FIT YOUR CAR - NOT!!!,"IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A FIT LIKE ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT. NO SPECIAL TOOLS REQUIRED. RIGHT, THE ONLY WAY I COULD HAVE USED THEM WAS TO CUT AWAY THE BACK PART OF THE SPLASH GUARD. THE PACKAGE SAID IT WOULD FIT EITHER THE FRONT OR BACK. BUT IN REALITY IT WOULD FIT NEITHER. ON THE PLUS SIDE, I DID GET A FULL REFUND EVEN FOR THE OPENED PACKAGE."
1,Do not waste your money on this crap.,"I ordered these for my 2011 Subaru legacy but they didn't fit. it doesn't match up with the shape of the car. if you are looking to buy this for Subaru legacy, this is the wrong product."
2,gobstoppers price,The gobstoppers have tripled in price since I last bought them. You might want to look at another site to get a better deal.
2,Follow this guy's advice at your peril,"He's not a real doctor. He has no credible degree(s) in nutrition. He's just another layman who thinks he and he alone has the ""truth"" about one thing or another. There is ""truth"" in every fallacy, but never the whole truth. Where he is truthful, he has just reiterated what most nutritionists recommend, so there's nothing new there. But there are also some downright dangerous and counterproductive recommendations in this book and if your health is at risk, you would do well to get second and third opinions before following his more extreme diet recommendations."
2,Beware!,"This product was supposed to help my dog heal, but all it did was mess up his stomach and give him diarrhea.Don't try it if your pet gets sick easily.Pretty disappointing."
2,Unreadable,"One would think that Springer-Verlag would be able to afford an editorfor the second edition of a book they charge $80 for. Apparently not.This book is so full of typos, misspellings, and bad grammar that it isessentially unreadable. The completely stochastic sprinkling of ""the""'sand ""a""'s throughout the text (a particular grammar difficulty of nativeRussian speakers) suggests that no editor has ever read this manuscript.On the positive side, the mathematical expertise of the author in PDEtheory is not in question, and the book does contain useful technicalinformation on inverse problems once you strip away the typos anddecipher the grammar."
3,She deserved better !,"Whenever I listen to this cd, it clearly says 1960's. Compared to Motown where when you listen to it, era's don't pop into my mind. The material seems weak and reminds me of bellbottom pants with peppermint stripes. Her voice deserved better because on a couple of the slower songs seemed to fit her voice. Still I'm glad to experience her voice solo."
2,StarSupreme/SadSupreme,"Like most ardant SUPREMES fans, I was anxious to hear the recently uncovered Flo Ballard project. Through the years, we'veall heard the same story: FLO BALLARD had the voice and was therightful STAR of The Supremes. I'm sorry, but it's just not so.FOREVER FAITHFUL is an interesting collectible for the curious,but it does nothing to diminish the DIANA ROSS star. Ballard hadnone of Ross's phrasing or articulation. The Ballard voice wasstrong, but like the third partner Mary Wilson,the voice was inno way unique. The Supremes could have been Ross and any othertwo background singers; but The Supremes without Ross? Nope. Doesanyone really remember the group after Ross left? Ballard's storywas a real drama at times but sadly, the legend is bigger than the reality. Ross was the Supremes."
4,She Was The Heart & Soul Of The Supremes,"Flo had the BEST voice in the original Supremes. The girl couldtear a song from the inside out, BUT, some of the material givento her by ABC, was just not right for her. She needed betterguidance in her solo career and personal life. I enjoy listeningto this album, even thou this is not the real FLO (except for Love Aint Love and Forever Faithful). It is a tragedy that this great lady is no longer alive, because she would have been a GREAT star if she had hung around with the right people.I will always love her thou. Sweet dreams, supreme angel."
3,alright...,"When I saw the necklace online I thought it was really pretty, but when I got it, it was junkier looking than the picture online. But I have got lots of compliments on it, so thats a plus. And it hasnt tarnished after going into the shower and pool tons of times."
4,A fine episode,An interesting journey into the human mind. Also contains the first use of the Vulcan mind meld.
5,"Yes, will buy Carrs Biscuits again!",This was really awesome and the price I think was a good deal! Geat to snack on or eat it with tuna salad or ground meat and have a great lunch also!
3,Hour of Liberation,"I pretty much give the book away when I say it was written by an Army major two or three years after the war. It is manifest that the historiagraphy in the book is geared toward one objective: Americans always win, the enemy, regardless of whom it is, always loses. The book is full with Army technical jargon and really does not explain what our soldiers went through. It is a general read that basically gives information about Allied and enemy troop movements from the landings to the liberation of Cherbourg. I gave this book three stars exclusively because of the fact that I was looking for the latter information. This book is only valuable to people who are very interested in these troop movements or specific WWII strategies."
4,Excellent Toothpaste,This is the same toothpaste I get from my vet but at a much better price. C.E.T. Tarter Control Enzymatic Toothpaste removes tarter & plaque leaving your pet's teeth bright white.
3,Comments of Theory and Design Adapt. Filters,"This is a good book. The book covers the fundamental concepts for adaptive filtering and explains it in a very simple way. You can really learn even if you are just begining in this field.However I was wonder that this will be a new book and not just a new edition of the book edited in 1986 by John Wiley & Sons. Unfortunately, the structure of the book is exactly the same and just have few matlab examples to substitute the old fortan programs.I hope that the authors realize that and add recent topics of research in the wireless communication cenario or at least improve the last chapters of the book that are too simple."
1,"Don't get this one, only works for short time","My husband got this as a gift, it worked at first and we liked the features. But a couple of months later we had to reset it, which by the way is a real hassle. You have to open the outside unit and unscrew some very very tiny screws which you need a special screw driver for, (not included) reset it, and put it all back together again. And then another month goes by and you have to do it again. After about 6 months the only part that was working any more was the inside temperature. The outside readings no longer worked even after resetting it repeatedly and removing the batteries and retrying. We gave up and bought a different one. Don't get this one!"
4,"SentrySafe 7250 Waterproof Floor Safe, 540 Cubic Inches, Gray","I own this item. It is fireproof if installed flush in a concrete floor. The temperature-rise, within the storage area should be minimum in the event of a fire. The lock assembly is well constructed and the combination lock functions smoothly. The threaded cover and 0-ring assembly which is flush with the floor should make the system waterproof if installed properly. However, this cover and flange is made of plastic and could melt, in the event of a fire, rendering the entire system, including the safe's contents, a complete loss, especially since water is usually used to put out a fire. If the flange and cover were constructed of steel, it would be a great system! -Jack-"
5,The Waterhole refreshes,"Great movie, and a great story. The dive-bar setting and cast of characters are relatable, memorable, and entertaining, and remind me of my earlier years. The dialogue makes you feel like you're sitting at the bar watching it all unfold in front of you. Definitely a must-watch film."
5,"Works great, and small enough to take on trips","I bought this, because I got tired of having to use a fan to get that white noise I need to sleep. If all I want is the noise why should I have the breeze to contend with too?I like the sound it makes, because it reminds me so much of the fan I used to use. It's not so loud that it blocks everything out completely, but I wouldn't want that anyway.The big plus is a super long cord, and a small form factor; these facts make it great to take with you on trips. Nothing is worse than trying to get to sleep in a hotel room without some sort of noise. No more having to set the radio to static or turn on the bathroom fan (which most places don't even have anymore).I'm so pleased that I'm going to buy another one for our daughter's room."
5,Worth it x10!,"This is well worth the purchase. I love it. We use it every night, and I use it when my son is taking a nap. It drowns out the noise of the living room, especially when the TV is on."
2,no real volume,the sound quality is perfect white noise but beware. It is super loud. And twisting the side for volume control does not really do much. it reminded me of being in an airplane the noise was so loud.
3,not what i thought,"The product was nice looking but just did not play the sounds i thought it would. I wanted the sound of rain, or oceans, or fire crackling. this was just a motor sound. Not a bad product but not what i needed."
1,580A Sleep Conditioner,I never receieved this item 580A Sound Conditioner. Amazon has not communicated with me regarding my complaint. When I receive my credit card statement I will report them to both Visa and The Better Business Bureau. And maybe Eyewitness News since I work in the public venue.the only order I ever received from Amazon was the 980A Sound Conditioner.
4,Soothing white noise,See no need for the dual buttons..this louder setting is perfect for sleeping. The constant white noise drowns out most noises... but as I am a VERY light sleeper I will still hear the occassional loud truck or motorcycle from a semi-busy road. But all in all I highly recommend this machine - it lulls me to sleep and usually keeps me asleep. A must for any light sleeper.
3,"Product is good, just not for me","I had to return it. I really was looking forward this, however it is way too loud for me. I usually like noise when I sleep, so I was looking for something to provide that and block out some snoring. However, it was hard for me to fall asleep because it sounded like someone had the suction end of a vacuum up to my ear (and I even followed the directions and did not have it on my nightstand like most people do).So the product works as it is probably supposed to, but this one only operates on the HIGH level, where the next model up works on two speeds, high and low. I guess that would be something to consider if you are buying one."
2,NOT what it seems!,"I got this because we wanted to finally rid the fans in our house (its coooold in winter!), but it is NOT loud at all. Maybe if I was in the middle of the woods (like up north) ONLY then this would come into use..or maybe a hotel, maybe. THIS MACHINE ISN'T EVEN AS LOUD AS A FAN ON LOW! crazy i tell you. Definitly not worth the money."
3,Too Loud!,"I was disappointed with this sound machine. We had one years ago when our son was a baby, and it worked great. I loaned it to someone and never got it back, and finally replaced it with a different model. When that one finally died, I decided it was time to finally spend the money to get another Marpac. I read the reviews that cautioned about not being able to adjust the volume, and boy, were they right---even with all the adjustments cranked down, it was still far too loud for our small bedroom. It is well made and I know they last, but the sound was too intense. I'm thankful for Amazon's good return policy."
4,Marpac Sleepmate,"This is very similar to the one I had before, except I found that one at a yard sale, and it was great! This one I think is a bit pricey, but it does the job. The on/off button is very hard to push--especially from bedside. It is also very stiff to adjust the sound holes. Lastly, it does produce a very small amount of heat."
2,motor already dying!,"I received this at the end of December 2011 for my infant daughter. It has worked great for the past 6 months and a few days ago the motor sounded like it was dying and now the sound is very faint and pretty much pointless. I love amazon for it's return policy, but since this was an independent seller, the return policy they have is for a partial refund (whatever that means) plus shipping costs. I like that this item is portable if we are traveling, but I am just going to buy and fan for her room instead of dealing with the hassle of trying to return it or exchange it. Hope this helps"
2,Very loud!,"I have always used a noise maker for sleep - ranging from electronic noisemakers to box fans. I was excited about the Marpac because it's mechanical, which seems to have the best sound quality. Alas, this unit was way too loud for my bedroom, even at its lowest setting. I think it would be great for a very large room or perhaps a collection of rooms. It also vibrates a bit, which made my wooded bedside table resonate unpleasantly. I reckon I'll stick with my box fan."
5,Great sound machine!,This noise machine works really well! We went on vacation and shared a house with 3 other screaming babies and our baby slept through it all! It drowns out the noise outside of the room. It was a savior for us! It almost sounds like a window unit a/c -which is what we have at home so it was perfect! You can still hear things outside the room but not as loudly.
1,Too Loud,Way too loud... instructions says you will get used to it in about a week. I could not take the noise... no way to adjust the volume of rushing air. I even tried it in another room.. returned for refund.
5,Works good,"I bought this for my home office as I talk on the phone for work a lot. I was hoping it would block out more noise than it does, but it works how it is supposed to. To block out extra noise, I may buy another. I do recommend for those of you who do not live in as noisy of an environment, and work from home. I do live in a prety noisy environment. I am not sure about using it to sleep, although I had it on for a little while to test it and felt very tired and had to go take a nap. My bedroom is quiet enough to sleep though and I prefer the noise of the TV anyway. I think this would work for people for sleep, you might have to get used to it though."
5,great white noise for baby,"I have been using fans for years to make ""white noise"" for my children while they slept. Our house is not very big and sound travels. The fans were good for the noise, but it seemed my baby kept waking up with a stuffy/runny nose. This product was a bit pricy, but I'm glad I bought it. We've had it for about a week and it is working wonderfully. I needed the sound to be pretty loud and it is. If you have a baby and are looking for a white noise effect to help them sleep-go ahead a get this-you'll be glad you did."
4,can't sleep without a sound machine,This is a very basic sound machine. White sound only. One speed only. It is a small blessing. It is well worth the money. I also have purchased other Marpac sound machines. I usually only get the ones that are very basic. This one fit that requirement very well. Very basic. Very functional. Can't sleep without it.
4,He wasn't Gandalf,"I agree with Vanessa about this album, however Christopher Lee was Saruman in LOTR, not Gandalf."
3,okay mp3 player case,"Bought this to use with my Trekstor iBeat Pink mp3 player (which is 1.5"" wide x 3.14"" tall x 0.35"" thick)and it was a perfect fit. Has a hole on both the top and the bottom so the headphone jack can come through. I wish there was enough space to keep the headphones INSIDE the case when not in use. Please keep in mind that this case is VERY SMALL, was perfect for my player, but my player is tiny! I can't imagine having a camera small enough to put in this case, so don't buy this one- size small- for that purpose. Also, one of the reasons I bought this was because it has the clip ring on top to hook it to your belt or bag or whatever. The included lanyard is a different shade of pink and it's ugly- I wouldn't use it and will get another one for my neck. It's a cute small case. Can't see the mp3 player screen or push the buttons while it's in the case, but it works well enough for me."
3,Good basic information for the DIY,"Typical format of most Haynes manuals, good illustrations and pictures. Intended for the do-it-yourself person that has average skills and some knowledge of automotive systems. I particularly like Haynes for their directions on improvising those ""special tools"" available only to dealers. Sometimes this type of advice is worth the cost of the manual, rather than have to buy or rent a special tool. Be aware this manual does not cover the 4WD models and driveline systems unique to them."
2,Didn't fit,"Was listed for my 2013 Nissan Juke, but wouldn't fit right. Luckily a friend could use them on his daughter's car."
4,FRONT AND REAR MUD FLAPS,GOOD LOOK --GOOD PRICE --EASY INSTALL --LOOKS AS GOOD AS FACTORY INSTALLED FLAPS AT ABOUT ONE TENTH THE PRICE --EASY INSTALL --NO NEED TO REMOVE WHEELS TO INSTALL
5,"Great book, formatting strange","Great book, but the formatting seems a bit strange, it like a scan on the book instead of an electronic version, tho.That's not really an issue, so.....Overall, excellent read!...Excellent Book!"
3,Excess ink-toxic?,"This tire toy is a great, durable toy, and my dog loves to play fetch with it- however after the toy was dirty, I was washing it in soapy water and I realized my hands were pitch black. The excess ink on the tire rubbed off very easily and did not completely stop coming off until 3 or 4 washes. This left me wondering if this was a safe toy for my dog. Don't you think the ink would come off when they are chewing on it and become toxic when swallowed? I just thought I would warn buyers of this toy to wash the toy thoroughly until there is not any ""loose"" black ink remaining on a towel after washing and dying-and to monitor your dog afterwards for any black ink on their tongue or bedding.-Just to be safe."
1,DO NOT BUY IF YOU OWN A PITBULL,"I received this through the mail yesterday and well my 9 month old Pitbull is tearing it apart as I type this review out.The tire tread is the first thing that he chewed off now he is ripping the side walls right out of it. The Kong brand makes a tough dog toy and i'd recommend that over this every day of the week, over the two months my Pitbull chewed on the kong it barely has a dent on it this toy however is not a Kong or as tough as one."
2,Too much lacking,"The premise of the book was certainly intriguing (two separate discoveries: an ancient biblical text and a strange fossil), but the story was never able to take it where it needed to go. Despite having a paleonotologist as a main character, the scientific aspects are never satisfactorily explained or integrated into the storyline.The antagonist is also poorly developed, being treated as purely evil without any ramifications of the evil (so what if he breeds?).Finally, the ending seems pretty rushed and fails to bring the story together in any way.Not worth the $7 - 8 cover price."
4,NO MORE ANGEL PICTURES IN MY HOUSE!!!!!,This was my second time reading this book. I love the story line and the only reason that I am giving it a four instead of five rating is because I felt that the author could have had more developed characters. It was an intriguing story and it definitely gave a new twist to the fallen angels of Heaven. I actually wish that I could have given it a four point five rating.
2,Ack! What a bore!,"I'm giving this wirter 2 stars, simply becasue he shows that he has writing SKILLS, and has come up with a decent premise, but this is a short story padded into a novel. The cover, which is great, shows nothing at all as to what this book is about. Neither does the cover copy on the back. If not for the Jeff Long blurb, one would never know that this book took place in Manhattan. One also has to wonder if Long even read this tedious novel--the book, which starts off okay, plods along so tirelessly that the reader will skim pages just to get it over with. A TRUE DISSAPOINTMENT. Get something by Michael Laimo or Preston & Childs if you want a good read."
2,Not what I was lead to believe.....,"I too was drawn in by the cool cover and blurbs by Jeff Long...this book in no way, shape or form is in the class of either The Omen or The Excorcist. I'm only giving it 2 stars for the premise...but I was growing tired very early on in this novel. Arius is a character Anne Rice would create on her worst day. Just a bad choice on my part..."
3,"Great product, but deceptive packaging","Be careful with this - in order to make it work for you, you have to buy two of them. It's only in the finest of the fine print do you see this - even the box it comes in is deceiving. Weber should get their act together and portray this single unit as it is."
5,Great Korean film,This movie is funny and cute without being trite. It follows Boeun and Sangmin as they marry for her grandfather's sake. There's lots of comedy as Boeun tries to juggle a husband and a boyfriend while keeping this hidden from the school.A must see if you love Korean comedies!
4,The wife loved it!,"Well organized and down to Earth. I learned a few things that my wife loves, so it was definitely worth the money."
5,Great great book,"Bravo, at last some discussion about sexuality that gets creative. I hought it was wonderful because it educates men, who have been all but completely left out of the loop about sexuality and how women have to fake it just to stop the fumbling.I will only add one more thing to your discussion. Have her stand on a ""Turbo Stroker"" or the like with a pair of high heel shoes during the act...a little reward for all of his patience."
5,Quite simply the best sex guide out there for men,"This book is very buddy-buddy, but not the kind of stuff you can talk about in the locker-room, or at poker night, without being embarrassed. It's focus on non penis-based sex really helps take the pressure off. I heard somewhere that the author said that simultaneous orgasm is like winning the lottery and that goood sex should be fun and easy. I was curious to see if the book would really deliver on that idea and it sure does. After years of spinning my wheels, this book gave me the sexual confidence I've really needed to take control of my penis and not the other way around."
2,The Author comes first?,"No doubt if seeking a way to pleasure your female partner, the title sounds great but doesn't deliver. It is a classroom type book with lots of facts with anatomy and physiology. It doesn't detail the techniques well, lack of pictures -- sorry if pictures seem crude, but seeing HOW it's done is what it's all about.After 30 years of marriage and getting old, one struggles to think of new ways to have fun and share it. Skip this one."
5,Highly recommend,Knowing the network this and advanced cunninglings talking about anticipation and core sex really does make for hours of enjoyment for both partners. Highly recommend even if you already think your good you can always be better.
5,Happiest GF ever!,"When my GF found this in my nightstand she sent a picture of it and a text to her closest girlfriends. They all replied I was a keeper. The best part about this book for me is, my girlfriend has never experienced orgasms with any other man but me. This book was a tremendous help in getting there. I have actually started re-reading this as I read it about a year ago. Thanks Ian!"
3,Worth reading,"I consider myself to be quite accomplished at oral sex, but I was still able to learn something from this book. The cutesy literary analogies kind of detracted from the readability for me. I was looking for information, not entertainment. YMMV"
1,nothing new or unusual,"this book made me yawn. why does this man think he knows and can even write a book about how to satisfy women. guys, save your money and spend the time with your girlfriends/wives"
5,"Must read for all men, and any woman that wants better sex","This is actually a well written guide for the art, biology and benifits to making love to a woman. It is written from a man's perspective in that 'get on the bus, and here's why' way. I really enjoyed it.I appreciate that Kerner takes a careing look to the mental/communication end of lovemaking that women require and explains it in a way that makes it easy for a man to stop being what women perceve as one sided.I think this is a must read.. It not only give confidence to the first-time lover, but gives insite to a women on her own sexuality."
5,Great Read,I definitely reccomend this book. It is just the encouragement that you need while going through life. This book will help you with your daily walk with Christ.
2,Helpful Book Or Just A Sales Pitch?,"I have to agree with Steven Willis from Los Angeles. This book might hold up a little stronger if it wasn't written by a publicist who seems like he is just trying to drum up some business. It's like those chiropractic offices that set up booths for free spinal exams at various sporting events. They give you the free exam, then surprise, surprise! Turns out they seem to think your back needs some chiropractic work. It's the same idea here, and while the book has a few instances of making good points, they aren't really strong enough to persuade the reader to adopt the author's point of view. On the positive side, it is written in a manner that is pretty easy to understand so you can finish it quickly enough, but it's just never all that compelling."
3,Upon closer look ...,"This is really an 80's Donna Summer video collection. Although the track list features 70's songs, there are no videos for those only concert performances from the 80's.I think the best thing about this video is the inclusion of ""State of Independence"". What a wonderful video!"
4,Music for change,"I didn't know anything about this musician until I heard his music played by the San Francisco Symphony. This is a very special music, perhaps not for everyone but for those who love the change! Perfect for a gift."
4,worth it for Electrolite,"I have to admit that I never really listen to the rest of this disc, I bought it for Elecrolight, and can listen to it all night long. This song alone can capture the feelings of a broken heart. The lyrics wrap around Stipe's voice, entering that little spot that no-one ever wants to expose to anyone. It captues the feelins of his bigger hits like evrybody hurts, but yet can lull you to sleep. The rest of this disc may be bunk, but it's worth it for this song alone."
2,Swivel Holster,"If you want something sturdy, don't get this item. Broke a few minutes after I received it."
1,POOR SHIPMENT AND PRODUCT,"I received this product in a plain plastic bag with no dunnage to protect it. The result was two broken ears on the bottom of the holder rendering the product unuseable and it wound up in the round file (waste basket). I emailed the seller and did not receive an answer, nor replacement product. I have no rating for this seller other than stay away !!!!!"
3,"Holds Razr V3 securely, but ...","Purchased this quite a while ago, but only started using recently when leather belt holder wore out. The swivel holds the Razr V3 securely with front IN. However, back clip is not securely attached and phone holder (with phone) easily falls to ground. While Gorilla Glue can repair, the ""swivel"" function is lost. After the glue dries out, the brittl back can again detach from the clip. Not a great design."
1,Wonderful as long as it works,"Jura-Capresso 13187 Impressa E8 Super-Automatic Espresso Machine, BlackI have had three of these machines, and most recently bought two so I would have one that would function while the other was being rebuilt. Even that was not enough since both are now non-functional and I am using a Bosch. This machine is superb, easy to use and produces excellent espresso when it works, but it fails quickly. During a two year warranty count on sending it back at least once. Otherwise buy another more durable machine. Now there are some excellent Nespresso choices that eliminate much of the grinding problems that seem to destroy the Jura machines so quickly."
4,...and there's a beautiful girl holding this CD.,"I actually find this one more enjoyable than ""Cydonia"". There's only 2 tracks with no beats. This I found odd, but there are ambient breaks in a few tracks. ""From a Distance"" is the commercial track that most Orb fans might not enjoy as much as the others. ""The Land Of Green Ginger"" is nice, but from ""Orb is"" is where the album really takes off. I've read that it takes a few listens to enjoy it more. It did for me as well. Some struck me immediately as brilliance. ""Abstractions"" and ""Hell's Kitchen"" are two of them. The songs are on the short side, but it's content are packed with imagination, beauty & excitement.I wish those in the dark could find samples of the songs. But if you are a long time fan like myself, I'm sure you will not be disappointed. A US or even Euro edition will not be released until next year, so you may as well treat yourself.From the Land of Green Ginger,RenePS - if you buy the cd, you'll understand my review title."
4,"Good, but discontinued product","This product has been replaced by the Clarity XL40D, found on Amazon atClarity Talking-Keypad Amplified Phone (54000.001)for the same price.Good phone, but latest product has better sound quality and features."
1,The death of the Force,"I'll start with the good... this book was well written. That's about it. In my opinion, it destroyed Star Wars. So many people are now jumping on the no Dark/Light side of the Force bandwagon and it just drives me crazy. The Expanded Universe had already degraded the movies when Jedi started getting tired just because they used the Force but this... please George, DO SOMETHING!"
1,The WORST star wars book ever,"I have read a lot of star wars books and this is the only one that i haven't liked so far. This book is not just bad, it's terrible. The author goes on and on about philosophy and meditation. The book would have been good if it had been about fifty pages long. I was able to skip several sections and chapters without missing a single thing. Do NOT buy this book."

2,"Wanted mudguards for the rear, got guards for the front","Still haven't even used these things. Should have sent them back, but I didn't realize they were for front of rear wheel well instead of back of rear wheel well. It wasn't clear at the time of purchase."
5,Good deal...great service!,When i purchased this product I was concerned about shipping in the cold weather. Plant did arrive in good shape and is still growing many weeks later. Plant was very large and I felt a good deal. I would purchase from this company again!
3,Don't ship this aloe with other plants,"Overall, I was pleased with the method used to ship this aloe vera plant - styrofoam shells and a covering to keep out the dirt - and the relative quickness with which the package was shipped. My plant arrived exactly at the date promised.I was slightly disappointed with how the plant was shipped with three other ones I ordered, however. While it's common practice to ship all the plants together in a box, I was not expecting Hirt's Gardens to stuff my slightly tall aloe into the box to fit with all the others. As a result one of the stalk tips has been broken off, and another stalk slightly wrenched and drooping. Furthermore, its spikes have made some slight tears to the leaves of the other plants I've ordered.3/5 rating due to bulk shipping quality. If you plan on ordering this aloe, do yourself a favor and separate it from your other plants!"
5,Pass the torch!!!,"My earliest recollections of reading are when I got my first library card in grade school many, many, did I say many?, years ago. The books that stand out as my first are The Moffat series by Eleanor Estes. To this day I can remember reading about the Moffat family, especially young Rufus. Perhaps I identified with him. I love the drawings in the book and the stories. They are full of family fun and values. I just bought these for my new step-children (getting married Mar 30/10) for them to get the enjoyment that I remember. An excellent value and free shipping if you purchase all 4. I actually received one free because I purchased 4. Worked for me. Enjoy!!! Perhaps they are what inspired me to become an author myself."
5,Highly recommend,"Carly Hennessy is a very talented and very beautiful vocied singer and she makes you listen to all of her words. Ultimate High is a great album and I liked the whole album. I liked all the songs,lyrics,music, and the feeling you get after hearing those songs. Beautiful You is a great song and so is Young Love. There's nothing bad about this album I liked everything about this album and hope you like it too. plg1313"
3,Early Junior is worth hearing,"Having become a Junior Vasquez addict (following him from the Tunnel to Arena to Twilo), I found that I could not rest without having everything by him in print. I was surprised to discover this little gem, full of songs the DJ wrote himself. It is generally agreed that Live Vol. 2 is his best work, and nothing in this collection is likely to change that assessment for anyone. But there are a number of tunes here that make the cd worth the list price -- among them ""Just Like a Queen"" and ""Cum on U Can Git It."" A few of these tunes also lean toward ambient, so those looking for the fully blown tracks of his legendary nightclub sets will get only about half of what they want. The vocals are also kept to a bare minimum here."
4,Worth the read,"Singing Away the Hunger: The Autobiography of an African Woman is or a nice look at Lesotho through the eyes of a Basothan lady. The means available to Lesothans to provide for their families is limited: work in hazardous mines or seek work in South Africa. Mpho M'atsepo chronicles the story of her life: the loves, hardships, hunger and heartbreaks.The narration alternates between different periods of her life which confused at times. She also changes tenses frequently during her telling. However, both lend a sense of credibility to this autobiography because (as explained by the editor) she transcribed Mpho's words almost verbatim."
2,Not worth reading,"I bought this book at the start of my third year in med school (I'm now MS4). It was useful for just one thing: making me feel less nervous about starting clinical rotations, since it gave me a general idea of what would be expected of me. The most useful parts of the book are the ward tips that give you a feel for the setup of each service. The actual review of relevant topics was pretty poor - too many details to be a broad overview of what you should be learning, but not enough details for you to learn each topic well enough, so you end up reading the same information again in a textbook. Also, once you do one rotation, many of the tips given in the book are useless, since by that time you will have a pretty good idea of what is expected of you and how the wards work. I didn't spend much time on this book once my first rotation started, and I stopped using it completely during the second rotation."
3,Not a bad reference book,"This is not a bad reference book but I also ordered ""Extraordinary Uses for Ordinary Things: 2,317 Ways to Save Money and Time"" and like that book much better."
5,How to repurpose most anything!,This book was just what I was looking for. I do my best to buy products in either recyclable or in biodegradable containers. What a treat to learn of ways to use items some might consider garbage for organizing my home and garage. I can feel better about my footprint in the landfill and save bucks on garbage bags!
1,vinegar duct tape and milk jugs and more,"I am sad to say that I gave this book only one star as many of the tips it provided just do not seem applicable to the world today. It was published in the early days of the internet and mentions things like cassette players, cds, VCRs and what not. It was just not what I expected -- I was looking for ""old-time"" solutions -- say early 1900's to WW II time -- for today's problems and tasks at hand."
2,Bullet Proof Wallets,"This album is weak, poorly produced and ghost doesn't even rhyme. This album disappoints and the only thing that should be bullet proof is your wallet, don't buy it. I'm a die-hard Ghost fan but he disappointed me, there are too many nobodys shining and they are weak lyricists, featuring raekwon, this album should of been featuring sidekicks.........."
2,como triste,"What a waste of talent......I have seen him in concert(PHENOMENAL PERFOMER) and have all his cd's.....this is the most disappointing one yet. I hope marriage is not the reason he lost his passion.....I hope it is a one time thing. I am sorry I spent (...) on the cd.....Marc, get it together ok?"
4,Fun for My Artist,"I bought this for my 5 year old son who LOVES to draw. The steps were pretty easy to follow. It breaks the whole thing down into simple shapes. We have enoyed drawing the dinosaurs together and he enjoys it alone. If your child likes to draw and likes dinosaurs, he will have fun with this book!"
2,attention all Biehn fans,"Ok, so I'm a Biehn fan. His talents were totally wasted on this movie. Only die-hard Adrian Paul and Biehn fans will appreciate this movie, and that's just because so few of their movies make it to meaningful/wide release. I'm a feminist, too, but the plot of a practically entirely female platoon behind enemy lines to disarm a No. Koren nuclear facility is too much."
1,total waste,"I'm a fan of both Adrian Paul and Michael Biehn, and even I couldn't sit through this entire movie. Maybe if they'd stayed focused on their characters and not stuck a B-rate ""G.I. Jane"" rip off into the middle, it might have been better."
5,CAPTIVATING!,I adored this book! It was the first I have read of Ms. Ryan's and it certainly will not be the last. I am already searching for the other 3 medievals she has out there. I loved Alex and once again I think the different than usual story line makes this book shine. I can't wait for the next one.
3,A dry read,"After reading other books on the Black Sheep, I was quite disappointed with this book. While it was interesting to see the Combat Action Reports reprinted, the rest of the combat accounts are quite dull. Research done by Bruce Gamble shows that many statements made by McClurg are factually inaccurate. There are some interesting anecdotes and pictures, including a picture that shows that Boyington clearly lied about his plane being named ""Lulubelle,"" but overall, I was glad that I borrowed the book from the library instead of paying money for it."
2,Nice concept-lousy execution,"When it works it's marvelous. Unfortunately it is a huge source of frustration. The big problem is in the ""hot-sync"" function. I have installed the software on four seperate computers, with three different operating systems. They all react the same way: within a short time when a ""hot sync"" is performed you get a ""Fatal Alert"" error on the Palm. Sometime a reset will clear it sometimes it won't. Sometimes you have to do a hard reset and lose your data. Their customer support is off-shore and the language problem is overwhelming. One-half hour on the phone just to get a Service Request number. When it came back it was exactly the same. The software has to be reinstalled regularly on the PC to keep it working right. I have reinstalled the PC software over a DOZEN times on four different computers just to make sure my data is safe and functionable. The software is MISERABLE!! Get a Sony."
2,Palm Support is Non-existent,"I own the Tungsten T2 and it's a nifty piece of hardware with a beautiful display and innovative features. However, mine arrived without the software CD. After two long distance calls to support including total hold times of nearly 50 minutes, I was told I could not obtain the missing software that there were no CDs to ship and nothing they could email me. This means basic Palm apps like the calculator and photo viewer are not present on my device. The representative suggested I return the device (at the expense of the retailer?) and either purchase another one or keep my Dell Axim. Free support for Palm devices only lasts 90 days (after that $25 a call) and they were not willing to help me, unlike Dell which has provided support and replacement without question or cost. The Palm hardware is nice, but the software is nonexistant and the support is laughable. Weigh these factors in making your PDA decision."
1,Bad,"I bought this product, but I didn't get the product, the seller didn't deliver, but at least I was refunded."
4,"unless you're really, really serious","This is an excellent coverage of single pawn minor piece endings because it's exhaustive. The explanations can be difficult: this should not be the first, second or even third endings book you take on! But if you simply enjoy the fundamental chess endings and have been through most of them already, then this has a lot in it for you. Nunn's explanations, although they can be difficult, really are helpful."
3,your dinner party friends will be impressed,"despite the fact that nathan shedroff is very capable of producing very engaging experiences on and offline, this is not one of them. all the topics are there, but how in the world could one be expected to be able to read through this book and gain insight into the process of developing the works shown within the pages? if you are interested in impressing your friends by making them think you follow the scattered flow of this visually impressive book then by all means, go right ahead. i might have a used one you can buy."
2,"Bonk, bonk on the Head!","This episode was entertaining, but not one of the best. As stated in other reviews, it was the obnoxious kids that really detracted from the other particulars including: curing the disease and, the budding feelings of Miri for Kirk."
2,An Episode That the Series Could Have Done Without,"There are some good ideas and concepts within this episode, but they are drowned out by the annoying chants of too many children.Yoeman Janice Rand has a decent role in the story. Unfortunately, it was probably this episode that helped the producers to decide to writer her out of the show."
5,Packed full of information and insight,"Besides plenty of practical information (hotels, restaurants, etc), this book contains seven suggested walks in St. Petersburg. They range throughout the center of the city, Vasilievsky Island, the Smolny area and the outlying palaces (and full attention is given to five of them rather than just Peterhof and Tsarskoe Selo as in most guidebooks). It also includes a walk in the Hermitage. These walks include good maps. Additionally, this book has excellent sections on the history of the city, customs and various subjects (the ""mafia"", icons, vodka, etc.) that provide context for your visit. The author is an excellent writer who, although she obviously loves the subject, presents a thorough picture."
3,"good tracks,but not every track!...","I know it's an horror movie but i'm tired of those neo metal groups which songs look the same (cf:stutterfly and bloodsimple).The rest is good but some songs screw up the atmosphere of the CD (har mar superstar,it's a very funny song with daring lyrics,but what the hell is it doing here?!...) and some are nice but boring (the stooges i can't help but laughing when i hear the way the singer sings!...lol) and the two last tracks,oh my god i hate 'hem!...And there's the great tracks,prodigy,my chemical romance,deftones,disturbed,the von bondies and my favorite track dried up,tied and dead to the world by marylin manson,on of his best song.Buy it if you love the raw sound but if you are much of a love song fan,RUN!!!!..."
1,EXPENSIVE and NOT hardcover,"BE CAREFUL if you want to buy this item at Amazon. I bought it for $170, and turns out Amazon sent me a paper back one. I looked up my friend's book, the hard cover one sucks so bad because it is so thick (almost three times as the real hardcover book)"
3,"Somewhat biased, but still valuable","A good reference tool for UFO buffs, just don't make it your only source of information.Make sure you read the ""skeptical"" literature to get a balanced view of things: anything by Carl Sagan, Phil Klass, Robert Sheaffer, or Kal Korff."
4,fun read,"I really enjoyed this book. The ending was a bit abrupt, but up until then I was very engaged. I loved the opening hook. I stayed up until after midnight to finish this book the day I bought it."
4,Good book for the proce,Helped me learn the basics for organic chemistry. It started off strong but lacked with more advanced problems. Still a good intro book and reccemond this edition
5,The Complete Pyramids: Solving the Ancient Mysteries,"I knew this book through the many references found in other books. Then, I read about Mark Lehner on Dr. Hawass's articles that refers to him as a accurate egyptologist. I waited for long time an translated edition in my language, italian, but not knowing when it will be published, I decided to read in original language. During my stay on USA, I found the book in a big bookstore, so I saw it inside. It's that I hoped: a very complete report on pyramids, not only the most famous, with update information and a impressive number of photos, computer drawings, schematics and other. So I decided to buy, choosing Amazon as my supplier (thanks to the bookstore for the visit). Thanks to my friend Guido that encouraged this acquiring. Ciao."
5,Fascinating compendium of Egypt's pyramid complexes.,"As an armchair archeologist, I was impressed with the completeness, detail and depth of information presented about the pyramids, their temple complexes and the cultures that produced them. This should be a core volume in your ancient civilizations library."
5,The Complete Pyramids,Good value for the money. A quality product with good text and very good color values on the photos and graphics. A nice addition to my ref. collection.
1,I dont get it,"lyrics were not agressive enough for me, plus i think they were silly. the music is ok, but my big beef with this album is her voice. If you like ear shattering-glass breaking glam metal, then maybe this is for you. Check out dimmu borgir, atreyu, unearth, lamb of god, susperia's new albums**(follow up review) 8/18/04 - To Glam boy: ""nallen"" when I called this glam metal, I was being sarcastic, compared to what I listen to it is. I would better categorize this as Progressive Gothic music (more progressive than anything else). And you can't read either, you said listen to the music and stop being stupid? I said their music was fine, it's the glass shattering singer! Finally - the darkness stinks even more than this band, you have no clue what I listen to. You want good gothic? Listen to My dying bride, Tristania, Orphanage, hardcore goth? Cradle of filth, Emperor, old mans child. Go buy a Van Halen or Dio album dude (lame bands like that you dork)"
5,Exactly what I needed,"Ordered this item to listen to my satellite radio without disruption.Quality was great,plug and play made it easy to set up.also has harness to plug into another component if needed.Great product..."
3,SHIFTING CHARACTERS' NAMES,"A book such as THE FIRST VERSE requires a certain suspension of disbelief as the protagonist moves through his increasingly arcane rituals -- and yet, credibility is nearly quashed entirely when it becomes apparent that the author, Barry McCrea, cannot even remember the names of his characters. For example, on pages 65-6 and 118 (Carroll & Graf, 2005), Paula McVeigh's husband's name is Frank -- and yet thereafter, as referenced on pages 184-8, the character has been re-christened Jim, for no apparent reason other than sloppy editing. With prose stylists and respected authors such as Colm Toibin, Edmund White, and Elaine Showalter blurbing this book, one would expect a more close reading of this somewhat ponderous tome to catch such egregious errors."
1,The First Verse ... a Little Bit Worse,"First, my bona fides. I am a voracious reader, especially of books of this genre. I have a masters degree from a prestigious university. I have been to Ireland. My grandmother's maiden name is O'Flattery. With all of that, I simply can't make any sense of this book. Niall goes off to Trinity College and on the very first day has a strange encounter with the attractive but elusive Pablo. Although there are references to him, we don't actually see Pablo again for at least 150 pages. Meanwhile, Niall falls in with some uninteresting characters who live their lives asking questions then finding the answers in random literature. He has a fling with Chris. Beyond that, not much at all happens but the prose goes on and on and on. I finally gave up around page 200 (of 350). This was a major disappointment because my expectations were so high based on other reviews. One description is ""intellectual."" It may be that, but it is also dull, dull, dull."
3,Post Not Rotating,The base of the lamp doesn't rotate after a few days. I don't know if it's defective or I'm doing something wrong. Does anyone else have the same problem. From a mom whose 3 yrs. old loves the movie Cars.
2,Da Vinci sugar free Blueberry syrup,"I have purchased locally many other flavors of Da Vinci syrups, and ordered blueberry online to try it, because it isnt available locally- and I love blueberry! Well, this was a disappointment to me- very very sugary sweet with little blueberry flavor; not to mention I paid 4x what I would pay locally.#very disappointed"
2,No Villa-Lobos,"Since I purchased this album specifically for the recording of the Villa-Lobos, I am extremely disappointed that it was replaced by ""He Shall Feed His Flock."" She sings everything beautifully, but it is not the recording it pretends to be."
1,Even people who have no sense of smell know this smells like s***,"This is one horrible f***in' movie. It is one of the most boring, tepid, lame films I have ever endured. This is the kind of film that Tarantino and Rodriguez were paying homage to in their recent film Grindhouse. Why would they like trash like this? It's not entertaining, it's not fun, it's just stupid and ugly. There are some decent biker films out there (Savage Seven and Hell's Angels on Wheels are 2 examples), but this is just the bottom of the NYC sewer system. Save your time and money..."
1,Can't Make Myself Like It,"You know, I tried, but I can't make myself see anything redeemable in any of the bad guys...lending this movie no moral complexity or statement about society almost at all. Any feeling of pity you might have for the mental illness, mental deficiency, psychological problems, or disability of all the characters is completely shot when they rape several women in drawn out, annoying, and uncomfortable rape scenes.I'm a fan of horror movies, and a huge consumer of B-movies in general. Rape scenes in which the women seem to like it cross the line into unwatchable for me.I'd have to reccomend you watch Hard Rock Zombies instead."
2,"Adequate, but not ground breaking","I bought and read this book, and found it to be somewhat lacklustre. While the content itself was interesting, it was not particularly applicable to my situation.I would recommend this as a read from a library, but can't personally justify the price tag."
1,All - just a man,"I agree that everything that we believe in should be based and studied on a Biblical basis and its foundation. I disagree with several who say that Rick Warren built most of his ""purpose-driven"" principles on the ""wisdom of the world"" and not on God's word. Much of the ""wisdom of the world"" is based on Biblical Christian principles, and they don't even know it! Why should we accept James Sunquist? He's just a man just like Rick Warren. Sounds like jealousy to me. Demeaning another person as this author has is NOT healthy for the church or the kingdom of God. Even though I've heard Rick Warren speak and feel he is a godly person, NO PERSON is to be worshipped and put above God."
4,Better than the first--but still a few duds,"Track 1-4 just slams you over the head with hardhouse vocal gems. Just when things should be climbing to even higher heights, the mix crashlands with 3 boring instrumentals!!! But Elle Patrice saves the day with the incredible track Rising. But that NRG is ruined too soon by a boring drum track. And then we get back to powerful vocal starting Saving My Soul...pretty poor programming if you ask me. Things finish off with 2 more vocal anthems. So overall, this is a pumpin mix, with just a small number of useless tracks that slow things down a bit. And once again, there could have been longer cuts. Track times:1. burnin up (5:55)2. Signed, sealed, delivered (7:00)3. Power (5:13)4. The walk of shame (6:30)5. 21st century (6:15)6. Maula (5:50)7. Madreselva (5:24)8. Rising (4:27)9. drums control (4:42)10. Saving my soul (6:47)11. red heels studio (4:10)12. desert sands (5:22)"
4,Police Officer 777,In this movie Mario Moreno plays police officer 777. The movie shows his battle with everyday crime and a group of thugs. It's quite funny but not as funny as some of his other films. The DVD is not done well in my opinion. The audio is horrible. You can still hear everything but it is not as clear as it should be. The picture is okay but they could have done a better job focusing it. There are no special features and no subtitles. The movie plays on its own. Hopefully people will start respecting cantinflas classics and make better DVDs.
4,Outstanding Gritty Fiction,"This guy can write. If you like commentaries about the underbelly of society, this is your kind of book. Fiction at its finest. True page turner.Enjoy."
5,A rude and in-your-face commentary on 21st century America,"If you thought 'Fight Club' was fascinating in a bizarre sort of way then you will absolutely love 'Survivor'. Packed with the same wit and slightly off-center perspective, Chuck Palahniuk delivers another hilarious and insightful look at the world we live in. Viewed through the eyes of a most unlikely hero, the book takes aim at the media frenzy that inevitably follows tragedy, the publicity and marketing fury that takes advantage of such tragedies and the gullible American public that not only swallows it all whole but shells out billions of dollars for a piece of it and begs for more. Put simply: 'Survivor' proves itself to be a rude but accurate in-your-face commentary of 21st century American greed and gullibility."
5,Weird but definitely a fun way to spend the day.,"Interesting plot development. I especially enjoyed the small touches. Such as how the page numbers act as a countdown similar to Tender, Fertility and the Agent's view of inevitability. Or Chuck's use of Duality, Fetility vs. The Agents predictions or the double nature of everyday objects to maintain the cleanliness facade .Enjoyable dialogue and tension like Tender's final prophesy or Fertility's ""evil job"". Overall, a unique perspective of contemporary America"
3,Another masterpiece,"It's difficult to follow up a work like Fight Club, but here, Palahniuk shows his prosaic dexterity by weaving the same old concept through a wonderfully different tale.Tender Branson, the lone survivor of the Creedish cult, comes to terms with his instability as he prepares to crash a jetliner into the Australian outback. In classic Palahniuk style, it's a retrospective tale, adding to the misery and discontent with so much of the character's 20-20 hindsight. It's grim and it's dreary, (right in the same vein as Palahniuks other books) but this one is a masterfully dark story. The plot is winding and often overcomplicated, and in the end is somewhat unfulfilling, but the prosaic style is unparalleled. Another solid literary work."
5,"Strange, scary, and hilarious",Excelent novel! This is my first Palahniuk novel and I'm impressed. I've seen Fight Club and liked it but this is much better. The way the media is depicted. The way celebrities are made and broken. It reeks of truth. Very impressive. Now I'll have to read Fight Club.
3,Fight Club II?,"Chuck Palahniuk definitely has a unique style; and this novel more than attests to it. From the first page, or should I say, the 289th, you can tell that this is no ordinary author. However, even the original becomes banal with repetition. I would recommend Fight Club over Survivor, if for no other reason than it's the latter's predecessor and, therefore, more raw and original. To those Fight Club movie fans out there who are dying for a sequel, this may be a good answer for you. You'll find that Mr. Palahniuk's prose could easily be narrated by Edward Norton himself. Overall, Survivor was a good story with a terrific amount of symbolism and social commentary for even the most obsessed reader to dissect. Just don't expect that Fight Club pizzazz."
3,Expected Better,"There were lots of rave reviews for this novel, however I found the book was not living up to my expectations. Yes, it will make you turn the pages, but it leaves you with a bad taste on your mouth when you reflect on it. It reads like an average movie--you aren't riveted at all (you CAN put the book down), and are easily distracted (hmm, maybe I should go do [fill-in-the-boring-chore] now). The sex is superfluous and doesn't mean anything, as though only to 'fill the quota' of sex expected in books these days. I would suggest reading it so you can get your OWN feel for it, there is an interesting idea underneath the extras (phone sex, drinking, etc.), but Palahniuk isn't skilled enough to work the interesting plot line throught the story in a way that would keep the reader interested."
2,No Fight Club--Not Even CLose,"I have to disagree with the reviewers who applauded this book. Hey, I loved Fight Club. This, however, was a hugh let-down. It read like a book of Fight Club outtakes. The cutsie numbering of chapters and pages backwards was ultimately irritating--reminding me how many pages I still had to slug through. And what was the point? Religious cults are bad? Am I supposed to like the narrator? It's very hard--I don't feel I know him at all. Must the book turn on a character who can unrelentingly predict the future? Is that cool? Funny? Meaningful? Clever?"
1,"Worst ""Modern American Lit. Novel"" Ever","This book, vulgar and pointless is the tribulations of a cult, lying, thieving character that is neither lovable, understandable, or realistic. Possibly the worst novel of all time because it doesn't ever focus on realism and doesn't hold a message that makes sense. It is perverse and disgusting, unfulfilling and cheap. The biggest failure of the chronicles of Tender Branson is that Palahniuk tried to write a 'great novel' with a realist style that only offended and lacked everything needed to produce a coherent product."
4,What a unique story,Again Chuck impresses me with his unique out of the box literature. Really cool story. Great development. I really liked it alot.
2,"Well written, BUT...","The book is well written, it starts out good (lots of nice quotes), but the ending is sooo dumb. It ruins the whole book. The book is generally predictable and although I like this style, the style only works when an author has something significant to say. Some may disagree with me here, but I thought Chuck had something much more significant to say when he wrote Fight Club. Of course, I couldn't put Survivor down, but in the end I was REALLY dissapointed."
4,Fantastic - Until the End,"Survivor: A Novel by Chuck Palahniuk was very different and unexpectedly enjoyable. It was a book of lists, but the use of the lists helped to put you inside the head of the narrator, which is a very bizarre place. Tender Branson was born and raised in a religious cult community. Being a lesser son, he had to leave the community and work in the city once he came of age. When his entire family and community commit suicide, Branson is left as the last of the cult. He finds unlooked for fame and is hailed as a messiah. You are never quite sure if Tender is sane, brainwashed, or a con man.The book is well written and keeps your attention, except for the ending. The ending was too unbelievable and seems forced. It was as if it was the ending to a different story."
4,Surprise! A strange book from Chuck.,"The story of a true survivor. The only survivor, supposedly, of some kind of Amish, death cult deal. Becomes a superstar. The takes place backwords, the whole story... Summedup in one word. Survivor!"
4,Razor Sharp Satire and Dryly Funny,"But to others that have read and enjoyed the book, I ask you this.. When Tender Branson is heading toward oblivion in a 747, he says that Fertility had told him that he already knows how to rescue himself if he chooses to, But ""I'm too stupid to know how."" This has left me curious. What do you think Fertility meant to happen to Tender?"
3,Only a middling novel from Chuck,"I have bought most of Chuck's books release so far. I got this one as a present actually.I expected a lot more from this book. I did like the style of how it counts down instead of up. The chapters start at the highest and work their way down as is with the pages.If you read the premise of this book, you would understand why.I have read a few of Chuck's books and love the twists he plays with in them. However, this book just left me asking ""Why?"", ""What happened?""..etc. Maybe I missed something...maybe something was not implied correctly. After I put this book down I thought someone else must have written it.This book is a sinker compared to ""Fight Club"" or ""Lullabye""."
5,"Better than Fight Club? Yes, BETTER THAN FIGHT CLUB!","the title there says it all... a book written in reverse, genius. This book demands to be read and experienced. Chuck is da man! wait till they make a movie of this one! David Fincher better direct, no one else can handle the story."
4,SURVIVOR....a tale for the masses.,"This book is the epitome of a monet being thrown off a two story ikea warehouse at the dawn of a new century. i enjoyed it thouroughly. Very thouroughly. I was a it weary, and a bit disturbed, but nonetheless, intrigued by the horrific jackrabbit disembowlment scene. THANK GOD THIS ISNT A MOVIE! hah! another thing i'd like to add is, that if your 40 and you havent defecated on your coat yet, pick up survivor, its a must have for mama's boys, and milk drinking sissies!. buy it. youve got nothing better to do!"
1,Dimensions incorrect,"My Bull-Boxer is having a toe on a front paw amputated tomorrow, and as her front legs are long I needed an E-Collar with a long measurement from the collar to the snout.The product description for this Kong XLarge shows 16.8 x 0.3 x 30.4inches, which logic would dictate the 16.8 as being the collar to snout measurement, the 0.3 being the thickness of the plastic, and the 30.4 being the unrolled length.That is exactly what I needed so I ordered it and had it 2nd day shipped to be ready for tomorrow.....and unfortunately the collar to snout measurement is only 9"" which means that my pooch will easily be able to get to her paw around it.So i'm back to square one and have to try to get something figured out by tomorrow (the largest E-Collar that the vet has measures around 10"" from collar to snout, and I need at least 15"" which is why I chose this collar based on the published dimensions).Not good, PLEASE clear up the misleading dimensions!!"
3,Kong E-Collar for Dogs and Cats,"This item took forever to arrive, so long I had to go to the vet and buy a collar, then it arrived as was too small for my little Chihuahua-terrier - a small dog - it was cat sized, and when it was returned, I had to pay a penalty for returning it. This was my worst experience with Amazon ever."
2,Potentially fascinating subject matter made sludgy by mediocre writing,"This book could have been much more . Mrs Child hardly emerges from turgid , often inconsequential details and stilted prose. A missed opportunity to dig behind the narcissistic post-war US food world. Saint Julia was an active player in that world but this reads like a very authorised biography! If readers want more insights and finer writing see Robert Clark's landmark bio of Jim Beard The Solace of Food."
4,thanks,"thanks I need this product because my the end and I research in internet, now I work so so thanks thanks"
3,An eclectic amassing of the evolving jungle/drumnbass sound,"Sampling the vocals of Chuck D from Public Enemy, Natural Born Chillers add a level of rawness that one misses from the early 90's days of jungle (rawness that is altogether vacant from the current evolutionary genre of drum and bass). Although the beat falls into an unsophisticated any-4-year-old-with-a-drum-machine march that chugs along with an ever so perky bass riff, it's that vocal track that brings you back. On paper, ""If you really like to rock the funky beat"" sounds simplistic, lame, embarrassingly passe even, but Chuck D's almost hoarse rap, processed to become an almost rhythmic element unto itself, would make even the most jaded and well-versed DJ hard pressed to not sing/rap along...Plus with some surprising mixxes that have no family resemblence whatsoever to the original track/"
5,Complete Jewish Bible,"Very good Bible for any one wanting to learn the ""Roots"" of where the Word Of God came from. Excellent translation AAA+"
1,Why the Yiddish?,"I don't want to repeat what has been said before, so I will just make one point. There are a number of Yiddish words scattered throughout the New Testament. Of course Jews no more spoke Yiddish in Christ's time than they spoke English. I asked Dr Stern why he had done this; he replied that it was to add to the Jewish flavor of the New Testament. That sums up the book - deliberate sloppy scholarship to convey a false flavor of Jewishness."
5,becoming real,I never enjoyed a Bible as much as this one. Though the language might be a bit too 'casual' the prose flows so clear and understandable that it breathes.Though I do not hold the view of the Messianic community--(the position of Yeshua as held by the translator) this does not in any way take from the CJB--i think it is important for Jews to at least know what Christians believe and why.
2,not too pleased,"I was disappointed in the kindle version of this Bible. I really like my hardcover edition of this Bible, but the kindle version is hard to use with no actual usable table of contents. You can go directly to a book of the Biblke, but not to a specific chapter or verse. I would recommend buying the actual book."
4,Good but need an upgrade,I have the kindle version. Don't like the fact that I can't go to what chapter I want to right away. I have to scroll through the whole book just to get to the chapter I want. If this is corrected please offer a free upgrade to those who have purchased the CJB. Overall I like the actual book.
1,WARNING: this is a Christian book,"This book is not for Jews. It includes the New Testament, the Bible of all believing Christians. Only a dishonest person would market it as Jewish."
1,DO NOT BE BRAINWASHED !!,"Obviously, there are many who have been brainwashed into thinking that ""messianic Jews"" are just that - THEY ARE NOT JEWS - they accept Jesus as their messiah and Jews DO NOT. PLEASE reconsider supporting these fringe movements - don't buy these books; don't accept flyers from Jews for Jesus on the streets; don't give up your birthright - your Judaism. The Jewish bible stops with the 'Old' Testament. Please use your common sense."
1,Pure Deciet,"This book is deceitfully titled. The only Jewish Bible is the Tanakh. We do not believe or acknowledge the ""New Testament"" and we would never call the word of G-d old.The more I see of garbage like this the more my opinion of Christians plummet."
5,"Pretty good book, has some worthwhile ideas.",I have had my own house cleaning business for 13 years but decided to read this book anyways. IM glad that I did because it offers up some refreshing ideas. Ideas that I plan to put to use in my business. There were many things that I do differently and I like my way better but I would say all in all that this book was worth purchasing.
3,"Bad horror flik, but fun all the same!","I saw Dracula vs. Frankenstein when I was a kid on Creature Double Feature which aired on chan 56 in Boston. Seeing it again on cable brought back alot memories of those bygone days. I love all the hilarious reviews on here and I agree it's a bad horror flik, but fun to watch! I think I'll order this just have around when I feel like delving into stupidity and camp!"
1,The Worse Movie!,"This movie is so poorly done its pitiful. The film quality is horrible, it looks like the tape was recorded on EP mode, and the acting and make up really sucks. The movie is 77 minutes long, but its on one of those shorter tapes. I bought this film accidently thinking it was part of the Universal Monster series, don't make the same mistake I did. This movie isn't even worth the 5 dollars that Amazon is selling it for. Stay away from this crappy movie!."
2,What mockery is this?,"We are brothers with the undead giant. This is a false tale that breeds misconceptions about our alliances with other tortured creatures. The bad film quality only makes the living laugh at us. I am prevented from giving it a 1 only because our Lord's name is in the title. Vampires, we must stop these cinematic assaults on our kind!!"
1,"The Worst, The Saddest, The Dumbest","The only way I can explain all the five star reviews under me is that it's the same guy reviewing over and over again. Don't waste your time. I love the old Universal films, as flawed as they are. This film isn't even fun in a so-bad-it's-good kind of way."
3,OLDER VIDEO,"MY TWIN GRANDSONS APPEARED IN THIS MOVIE WHEN THEY WERE ABOUT 5. IT WASN'T MUCH OF AN APPEARANCE, BUT I NEVER HAD FOUND THE MOVIE BEFORE....IT WASN'T TERRIBLY SUCCESSFUL. WHAT A SURPRISE TO FIND IT. WE GET A KICK OUT OF THE 2 MINUTE SCENE."
4,After a 1 STAR Review now a 4 STAR *****UPDATED*****,"After contacting technical support concerning red/green light question on the frames and getting a minimal help, I've decided to send these back. (I could only see the green lights flashing, but no red lights)The question I asked of Andrew at Technical Support was.....""Are there two green lights and 2 red lights on each lens or is there only 2 lights per lens?""With the glasses off I could see a faint red ring around the green lights but no separate red lights.But the question was ignored.****UPDATE****Andrew from Mindplace contacted me 6/29 through email and will be sending out some new lightframes to replace my defective ones. He indicated he'd send me a note when the new ones shipped out. I will update my review after the new lightframes come in and I'm able to fully enjoy/try the product."
5,"It's hot. It's cool. It's hip, it's nostalgic... it's The Pop Masterpiece","Bored? Have you heard it all before? Try this record: the logical conclusion of all Pop preceding it, and the antecedent to most of what has followed. Including sumptuous Pop, cool Jazz, stinging Rock, and sensual emoting, you probably have heard this record before, but you may not know it. This record echoes in the subconscious. It's hot. It's cool. It's hip, it's nostalgic... it's a timeless classic. For an average American, it's a true sophisticate's discovery and an unexpected journey. For everybody, it's instantly enjoyable, yet also challenging, a bit frightening, funny and, most of all, lush. Whatever this is, specifically, it's not been done better."
5,Gravel sans velvet,"I love this guy... a story teller, a poet, a singer. Get Melody Nelson. And check out his talented daughter's (Charlotte Gainsbourg) work in film (Science of Sleep; Jane Eyre) and on disc (5:55)."
5,"Smart, funny and totally brilliant",Who knew that author Harlan Ellison was as funny and topical as George Carlin or Lenny Bruce? What a great CD. I just found out that Deep Shag Records has put out Volume 2 and YOU KNOW I will be getting that.
4,Bang for the buck!!!,"I bought these shades as a replacemente for my lost oakley flak jacket and the only thing i miss from the old pair is their strength. Dont get me wrong, im not saying this bolle is fragile, its just that i was used to a differente type of frame. Overall, this is the best brand name pair of sunglases i have bought for under 100$. Polarization is really good, almost no distortion whatsoever, great nose pads. Fit is unbeatable for large faces like mine. Would definitely buy another pair in anoher color to use as my running glasses. Totally recommended folks."
2,Nose pieces come off easily,"These are great sunglasses EXCEPT when the nose pieces come off. I treat my glasses with care. I have three pairs and for all three pairs, the nose pieces fell off rendering the glasses unusable (or at least very uncomfortable). Called Bushnell (bought out bolle) and was told that they'd send me replacements just this once. What? It's their product that's defective! Anyway, I received the nose pieces with no glue. Called again and told to use anything except Gorilla and contact cement. They wouldn't tell me what they use to secure the nose pieces. I tried a few different glues but no luck getting the pieces to stick. I think they are made of silicone. Not much sticks to silicone. Buyer beware: it's not if, but when the nose pieces will fall off and ruin you day/vacation."
3,shoulda known,"I am a big Bones fan, but I should have known from the title that this CD would be chill, too chill for me. It is a great CD if you're into that."
3,Decent remix album,"This CD is pretty much just a remix album. The remixes are decent, of course, if you are a die hard Kidneythieves fan, which I'm not, simply because I have such a broad taste in music, this is a must buy.I wasn't too impressed with the Zerospace remixes, but they are good, and the other remixes never really caught my attention at all. So this CD is basically just sitting on the shelf.Though, funny thing, this was the FIRST Kidneythieves album I did buy, simply because I heard Zerospace and needed to own the song.It's not a waste of your money, if you love KT."
2,It pulled me from.............,"I have been listening to this nonstop for the last 3 days. There's not one bad song on this albumn. Placebo makes me want to have sex. It's been a long time since a song has done that to me. Thanks Riuichi Sakamoto, and now thanks Kidneythieves/Terminalhead. This will go on my list of all time favs."
4,Sasquatch,"Sasquatch, by Roland Smith is a great book. This of one of my favorites but it was not the greatest book that i have ever read. This book has a lot of suspense, especially around 3/4 into the book. I recommend this book to people who like suspense, myths, cryptzoology, and the great outdoors. There were many cliffhangers in this book which kept me wanting to read more and more."
4,The Sasquatch,"The Sasquatch is a pretty good book, it's a mystery story. This book made me wonder who is the sasquatch after I read the first few chapters. This book was alittle too easy for me, which I don't like. Most people can finish it in few hours."
5,Sasquatch,"This book was awsome. It was a very interesting book ,it makes you just want to keep reading. There were so many cliffhangers I just couldnt stop reading it. Overall, I thought this book was great."
4,GREAT for Seniors,"I bought this product for my eldery mother. She has Alzheimer's and dropping food seems to be one of the things that she has hard a time with. If you've ever taken care of a person with this desase, you know that it's easier to derail a problem than to fix it. I was using dish clothes before finding this. It's GREAT! It's adjustable at the neck and has the length to cover their clothing. This is a blessing for me and my family. There'a sllot more than needs my attention than doing laudry everyday."
1,review,this is OLD SCHOOL like dos with a dot matrix printer. but cut the man some slack for an early release in his discography list. this cd would make a great frisbee.
4,Interesting and Educational,"I would say that this DVD is very educational and interesting. The Park Ranger is very accurate in what he has to say in this video. You have to imagine what went on during this event in the Civil War. I am hoping they could come out with a reenactment of this battle and the thoughts that Gen Meade was thinking when he encountered the attack. I think Gen Robert E. Lee was a very sensible leader and he made the the wrong mistakes in not knowing that his army was not prepared with more than enough artillery to support his troops for this battle. The video was very exceptional and interesting and the Ranger was very detailed in what had happened that 3rd day of July 1863 at Gettysburg, Pa. The audio/ video team did a very good job in executing this assignment out in the field. I would rate this DVD a 4****'s for this detailed subject about Pickett's Charge and the thoughts in which General George Meade had to encounter the attack toward the enemy."
5,The best of the best,"wonderful, excelent, perfect. Cortazar is a GENIUS. That's all. (I recomend ""Don't blame anyone"")"
1,"faulty product, bad customer service","I received this product as a gift for Christmas. The remote temperature sensor was broken out of the box. After several emails to the company over a week ago I have yet to get a response. I called customer service, waited twenty minutes on hold only to have someone offer to take take my name and number for someone else call me back. Bad quality control and even worse customer service. After reading the reviews here about the alarm I think I might be fortunate this is going in the trash."
2,Fine...but not there are better,"Its a fine unit, but its bulky and cannot be hung on the wall. And there are temp alarms that wont turn off until I set the alarm temp to 120 and -40. Why the alarms go off even when the alarm iteself is turn off...makes no sense. 2 stars for this failure."
3,good product,"The Oregon Scientific weather instrument is a nice item.As a 69 yr.old I found the writing to be too small.It was also difficult for me to set the alarm for weather changes even though I thought I was following the directions carefully.The weather alarm keeps going off at 37.4 degrees and I can't stop it.Maybe something ws left out of the directions.Thanks,Lloyd Julian"
4,"Is't no much, but just what I was looking for","Thanks to ""destructo""'s advice, I set it to channel 2. I don't want the freeze-alarm warning going off in the middle of the night.All I wanted was an outdoor/indoor thermometer, and this one fit the bill for cheap. Lithium batteries in the outdoor unit, and rechargeable NiMH batteries in the inside unit. Should be just fine. Time will tell."
4,Duh,"I love love LOVE the look of these boots! I wear them when I'm going out on the town and occasionally to the mall. Do they hurt the ball of your feet after about 4 hours--well, yeah! They have a 3 inch heel so get some gel insoles and don't over do it."
4,Cabin 102,"Twelve year old dusty has a fear of drowningand when his step mom wins a trip for a cruisehe doesn't want to go. He ends up being forced to. On the cruise no parties seem to suit him. Some weird things starthappening, like cries from the other rooms, flickeringlights, and faucets going on and off. He decides to go checkthings out in Cabin 102 were the unusual cries came from. Heends up meeting Tahni, a ghost of an Indian, which was drowned by the Spaniards. Tahni teaches Dusty how to over come his fear of drowning. At first he doesn't know that she's a ghostbut by going to an museum with Lionel he quickly finds out thestory of her life and swears to get her back to her island so her spirit can rest in peace. When a wave that is over 30 feet tall comes from a storm inthe north Atlantic, Tahni spots it and Dusty alerts the peopleon the ship. When it hit the ship was tipped almost on it's sideand Dusty slid off it...."
3,Short Term Fix,"I really liked this at first, but the longer I used it, the more dry and sticky in the container it became. I liked the coverage and it did stay on a long time, but it seems like it's not as smooth as when purchased. I worry about using it now."
1,Water Proof Anyone?,"The boat lasted about a good five minutes then when a lake wave hit it, then it stopped working. It does not appear to be very well made or water proof."
2,meh...,"This watch looked good in the pictures, the dial is slim, and it is perfectly adequate, but the strap is short and looked cheap upon arrival. Not a bad watch, but not great. I ended up returning mine. I would recommend viewing this model in person before buying to make sure you like it. Thank god Amazon makes returns easy."
5,Great watch for the money,"The watch was a gift for my husband. The product came quickly, works great, and looks really nice. We are very satisfied."
5,Much better ride now,"I just installed these on my 1997 Ford Crown Victoria yesterday. The ride is so much smoother now, and I haven't replaced the front springs yet. All the creaks and moans, and violent bounces from going over the slightest bumps, gone. If your car shakes like crazy, I would definitely recommend you consider replacing your coil springs."
1,very disappointed,I ordered this cherry syrup because I love cherry cokes. I had gotten some cheap sugar free cherry syrup at Wal-Mart for snow cones and loved it but could no longer get it because it is a seasonal item. This was expensive with the shipping but it had gotten great reviews. I am very disappointed. It has a very medicinal after taste. I don't normally take the time to write a review but I don't want anyone else to spend nearly $20 with s/h for this. I'm pouring mine out. Try something else.
4,Awesome!!!!!,"Snapshot is a combination of jazzy upbeat & smooth sultry jazz songs. One of my favorite on this CD is No Rhyme, No Reason - a beautiful ballad. George Duke you are great! Enjoy!!"
4,a timeless classic,"This album brings you into a different world of contemporary jazz, it also has an eighties feel branded on it. However I feel as though it is a timeless classic.Thanks"
1,Wish it would install on my machine,"This is actually a collection of a bunch of different ASL programs. That might sound good at first, but it's not. They are all over the place as far as quality, and most of them won't install on my 64-bit Vista machine. Waste of money for me."
4,Good burpies,"Nice burp cloths - thick enough to absorb, but nicer looking than a cloth diaper. We use these more than our other burp cloths. Look out for high shipping costs though - it was nearly as much as the product itself!"
2,First impressions,"There are three certainties in life. Death, taxes, and lately, bad tribute albums. I don't even know who'd performing these songs, because I haven't bought the CD. That's also the only reason I'm being fair and giving it 2 stars instead of the 1 I'm sure it deserves. The first thing that struck me about this album is that it only has songs from Blink's last two CDs. Anybody seriously interested in doing a tribute to Blink should recognize Dude Ranch at the very least, and a good cover of Carousel wouldn't hurt, either. Instead, we have overly faithful covers with weak vocals and no energy. What's the point? Anyone who cares enough to buy this CD already has Blink's last two albums, so why do we need to hear them performed worse? Don't buy."
1,...,"All I have to say about this cd is that it must be a bunch of freaks who came together to mock blink182... because if they were actually TRYING to sound like them and make a cd to tribute blink182 then i would just fall down and laugh (which I have already done just listening to the thing). I have to agree with everyone else when I say that this cd shouldn't get any stars at all, not even one. I don't even know why this cd was even allowed to pass the recording studio and even stain blink182's collection of music... and did you notice that they only did songs from Enema of the State and Take off your Pants and Jacket? Not even a tribute in the first place if you left out their earlier brilliance..."
1,Please Kill Me Now,this just sounds sooooooooooo bad. the guitar riffs and and drum lines are exact replicas of blink 182 and the singing is just horrendus.please DO NOT BUY THIS ALBUM
1,Absolutely incredible ...,"Absolutely incredible that it is possible to play good, easy music this poorly. Amazon.com says this cd features various artists but it lies ... its the same singer and the digital instruments don't do anything for me either. DO HUMANITY A FAVOR AND DON'T BUY THIS ALBUM. Simply wait until 11/18/03 and buy the new one with the real Blink 182 which will undoubtedly be superior to this piece of garbage."
1,This Sucks ! Dont buy!,"This is the worst CD IN THE WORLD! They dont even sound like Blink. Why would they even put out this CD! Who the hell would approve this and actually make this a ""tribute!"" This makes my ears hurt. Its so bad. The guy cant even sing. You will be stupid if u buy this cd. I didnt. Just listen to the sound clips. Save your money and buy the real Blink 182 Albums."
1,BOOOOO!!!!!,O man this sux.. its not even realy people if u listen carefully u can tell its just instrumental actuall blink n the voices are just computers believe me DO NOT BUY THIS CD ITS SUXX!!!!!!!
1,Good Lord,"This CD Is the dumbest thing i've ever heard of . . . These guys . . . whoever they are, are never getting anywhere in the music industry. this is just a bunch of blink wannabes singing a bunch of blink songs on one messed up CD."
4,Leaders,This leader disappears when it's in the water so the fish can't see it. Although it should come in 100m rolls.
2,Disappointing.,"I Followed directions, charged it, used it a little, charged it again. The first use, charge only lasted for 20 minutes. Now it only lasts for about five minutes. I think I wasted my money."
4,Better than the original Tubular Bells,"After having listened to both the original Tubular Bells and Tubular Bells II, I much prefer the updated version. The original -- though still awesome -- is a bit dated for my taste."
4,"An enjoyable effort, But why??","While Tubular Bell II is a throughly enjoyable recording, in it's own right, the question needs to be asked, Why was it made?The recording follows the same basic themes as TB1. Right down to, what I call the Cave-man band in the middle of what would have been side 2 of an LP.Don't get me wrong, I like the CD. But again the question comes to mind, Why was it made?"
5,Fun designing and playing,"I bought this game a few years ago for $20 and it is still one of the best games I've ever bought. The game lets pick a part of the world you want to build a golf course, lets you design it down to the last detail and best of all you get to place the courses that you build. I never get tired of this game."
3,a very mixed bag,"I've listened to it once and ""Hickory Wind"" is ever gorgeous. Some of the tracks are weak, though, and some are Gospel/Bluegrass treacle. Well, Ricky Skaggs is involved. Not a ""must buy."""
3,WHERE'S THE SIZZLE?(July-2011),"Hey- I get the ""ROMANCE"" title but most readers are used to some sizzle in their romance novels! This book is strictly by-the-book reading. If you enjoy JANE AUSTEN books this is right up your alley. I read it & enjoyed the storyline sans the physicality of it's characters. The price,alone, should satisfy readers."
4,Historical Romance at its best!,"This is one of the better historical romances on the market today. While there is still plenty of passion, there is also a credible historical backdrop woven into the plot. Joanna, the heroine, is just a little too independent to believe, but otherwise the story itself is well-told and the little twists make this more than a run-of-the-mill romance. The hero is also a man with faults, but not so darkly brooding as to be a stereotype. The sexual encounters were tastefully written yet still steamy! Recommended for all lovers of historical romance."
1,DISAPPOINTMENT,"Sexual tension and disrobing of characters does not a mystery make. Lacking in plot, punctuated with predictable sexual trists, bears more resemblence to a cheap love story. No more PB Ryan for me."
1,I tried!,"This book rambled on & on away from a mildly interesting plot. Some servant sent to get his Master's daughter away from her husband who was treatingf her bad, & she has fallen ill & so is the father. What fatigued me even more was the bad language in this book. You don't have to curse or use God's name out of context to write a book or talk. I have been ""curse~word~free"", for more than 30 years. I stay that way by surrounding myself by people, music, & reading material that is also, ""curse~free."" It is a wholesome life when one respects God & others."
4,"Good author, good book","Although 'Heaven's Fire' is my favorite so far by this author, 'Silken Threads' was good, too. I definitely like it better than it's sequel, 'The Sun and the Moon'. The characters were likable and the romance was worth the wait. FWIW- This book definitely has adult themes and doesn't mince words when describing the sordid side of medieval life."
2,One of my first introductions to biomechanics as a kid...,"Though some of the aspects of biomechanics and scaling that are addressed in this are somewhat simplified, I still find this to be an illuminating book. My father (an engineer) got this for me when it came out (I was 12) and it took me some years to get through it and understand what it was all about. I would certainly suggest it as an introduction to many of the issues modern functional morphology in vertebrate paleontology deals with. It is full of clever but simple ways tofigure things out, who can resist that?"
4,Great CD,"OK, before i get into this review, let me just state that I am a 14 year old kid that is mostly into rap music. My mom would play this cd on our way up to a resort to go skiing when I was younger and I remember loving it. Just recently, I found this laying in our attic and decided to give it a listen for ""old times sake"". I remember liking the songs ""Tears in Heaven"" and ""Layla"" but those were the only tracks I remembered. However when I listened to it just recently, I liked almost every track. I think the whole acoustic guitar thing gives certain songs a nice touch, especially ""Tears in Heaven"". My favorite tracks on this album are ""Tears in Heaven"", ""Layla"", and ""Before You Accuse Me"". I will continue to listen to rap music, but this CD has expanded my tastes to different genres of music. The only reason I'm giving this 4 stars as opposed to 5, is because i am into a little more of the harder rock, such as Led Zeppelin and Jimi Hendrix."
2,Uninspired blues playing,"This is one of those recording where if you are a fan of the artist, you will love it, but if you are not, you won't. For me, Layla and Tears in Heaven were the tracks that I liked, but the covers of acoustic blues standards sounded tired and uninspired like he had played them too many times. If you are not a big Clapton fan, best listen to the original blues men do these."
4,CD plays fine,The disc arrived quickly in good condition. The case is ok except the center fingers are broken off on half of them so it doesn't hold the disc securely. But it works good enough. Music plays fine.
5,Great Work,"If Clapton were alive during the reign of Beethoven and Mozart he would have been right there with them creating musical masterpieces. This CD, a classic work, is one of the high points in Clapton's musical career. This CD revitalized interest in the old master when many of his contemporaries had long since stopped creating new and innovative music. If you ever are skiing out west, have a sweet MP3 player, are in a glade of pines in fresh powder, I do not think there is a better CD to listen to than this one. Clapton never gets old, and this CD will stand the test of time. A+Joseph Dworak"
2,"Great execution, but not enough small tiles","I just bought one of these yesterday, and was thrilled with it until I tried to do a more difficult puzzle (from a Saturday paper). That's when I realized that the supply of small tiles is completely inadequate. They supply 9 of each number, which is nowhere near enough. I ended up making little cardboard numbers (which were a *huge* pain to use); counting up afterward, I found that I had made a total of 72, including 20 of one number. So there should be at least 3 times as many of the small ones as they give you.I looked to see if I could get more from the company, but the web site listed on the box no longer exists."
5,Sleepless Nights,"Mr.Moore owes me for several nights sleep. First, for those when I couldn't put the book down while I was reading it. Then for those after I finished it and still couldn't stop thinking about it. If you ever experienced being the new kid in town this book will awaken old memories, many of which will make you cringe. The only difference is that you weren't capable of supernatural vengance, and for that you should be grateful. ""Under the Overtree"" takes the tired old adage about being careful what you wish for and gives it a couple of sharp twists. I strongly recommend this book to any horror fan who has a couple of nights sleep he or she doesn't mind losing."
5,Amazing film for the times,"Unbelivable aerial dog fight sceen, which modern day liability insurance would never allow!"
4,"What can I say, it's a classic!","Well here you are, the 2 Million dollar, or something like that film of Howard Hughes. This film was spotlighted in the movie ""The Aviator"". I happened to see it a few years before ""The Avaitor"" and found it remarkable for its time. Thank you Turner Classics! Considering it was made during the change over from silent movies to those with sound, you can defiantly tell what scenes were re-shot with sound and which are originals to the silent script. Though it's a bit long-winded, and slow at times, its still a great story and film. Take good note of the characters in the beginning of the film. It's likely one of the first films that ties everyone in through out the story the way it does. A great classic, it defiantly show's its age but is still quite enjoyable."
3,You have to consider when it's made.....,"After seeing ""The Aviator"" we were curious about the movie. I would have given it a 1 star,but my husband said you have to consider WHEN it was made. They all ""over acted""back then because they were just coming off silent movies. It was kind of fun to watch it from the stand point of recently seeing ""The Aviator"". You could see when Hughes was loosing it, you could see the problems he had while making it. I guess my husband was right, a 3 star might be good for this movie. The story was pretty decent, the plane fight was pretty amazing for the time it was made considering they didn't have ""CG"" back then!!"
4,Hell's Angels,Great movie with a lot of WWI aircraft in real flying scenes. A must have for any Aviation movie collector!
1,"First come, first served, eh? March 17th and still counting...","IN STOCK SOON!12 weeks and counting. How about you?Maybe Amazon thinks we're supposed to use it to haul snow next winter.Nice going, guys."
3,Not sure about the 600 lbs capacity,"This is excellent for yard work, as well as carrying drunk relatives around after a backyard party. I question the 600 lb capacity...Uncle Bubba is only around 350 lbs and this cart could barely contain him."
2,still trying to assemble,I bought this cart for my wife to haul mulch & dirt around the yard. The instructions are not that great AND there so far are parts I can not account for. Not really looking like I'm going to be able to use it for what we need if I ever get it put together.
5,Great little Gorilla,"I was lucky--mine came already assembled. I played with it a bit before purchasing it, and knew it was the ticket for me. So far, it's done everything I've asked, including hauling long poles, boxes of books, sticks and dirt. It rolls smoothly, corners well and is sturdy."
3,Tricam GOR200B-T Gorilla Carts,Was impressed with how well the bottom of the cart was built but the plastic part of the cart is smaller than it looks and also very flimsy would have been much better to pay a few bucks more for a steel or thicker plastic. When I put firewood in it the plastic top bulges and will not hold anywhere near 600 lbs. without breaking the plastic
1,"JUNK, not worth the money!","600 lb capacity with a 300lb dumping capacity, why carry 600 when you can't dump it?I bought mine, was hauling stone and the tub cracked, I called tricam, they wouln't do anything for me.Anyone want to buy mine?bobinpa"
5,CJ's Gator Wagon Review,Wagon works great. Easy to pull and dump. Holds everything I want it to. Only issue I had was putting it together. Needs either two people or someone with long arms to reach bottom and inside at same time.
1,"Free, but possibly not worth it","I can't complain too much about free content, however, the format makes it almost not worth the time trying to decipher the titles and actually get to the poems. The contents contains no links to individual poems so you have to page through the entire volume to get where you want to go. Additionally, none of the poem titles that are listed in the contents are separated by punctuation; they read as one long continuous line of text, which needless to say, is unacceptable. Very poor presentation overall."
1,2393 pages and no table of contents? Really?!,"How are you expected to get to what you want without a table of contents?! It is tedious to find the poem or story you want. You can book mark it, but you have no way of naming what you bookmarked so you are left with whatever excerpt of the top of the page you marked. Meaning that if you bookmarked The Raven, the excerpt was whatever poem finished at the top of the page since The Raven starts in the middle."
1,Too Large a Body of Work to Navigate Page by Page,"I agree with all the other reviewers: beware ""free"" books with poor navigation, you will rue them. Unless you like thumbing slowly page by page or picking page numbers out of thin air, hoping the poem or story you're looking for is on it, don't download this book. The time it will cost you in wasted labor, will not be worth the savings."
3,"Love Poe, but something's missing.","I looked and looked, but could not find Tell Tale Heart and was greatly disappointed. I enjoyed it, but completely skipped the notes. I didn't really want notes, but it's hard to find a free Edgar Allen Poe Complete Works without notes."
2,"Poe = 5 stars, this ebook = 1 stars","Poe deserved better. There's no table of contents, there's no line breaks so all of Poe's poems are essentially a run-on sentence. Yes, it's free, but it's worth spending the money for a properly laid out book."
5,Everyone should read Poe at least once....,"Having studied Poe in High School I have always had a soft (dark) spot for his works. Even if you only read The Raven, this download is worth it."
4,"Good people of the jury,","This book is fantastic, in my opinion being very much due to his poetry. Quite a few outstanding citizens seems to believe they have a right to base the review solely on 'how unreadable' the poetry is due to the format. While I can admit that I have seen better formats (see 4 stars) I do not believe it to be entirely just to poorly rate the work. Poe is a genius, and although the format leaves something to be desired, it would cause one to think ill of another who claims the book is 'unreadable.' My sincerest apologies to whomever I have offended, just realize that in all honesty you've brought it upon yourself."
3,It's ok,Its been a while sice I read Edgar Allen Poe and I was not disappointed. A must for our collection
4,Kindle Review,"This is one of my best deal purchases and something I have really enjoyed reading on the Kindle. Although, the book or books, however you look at it, takes a while to read; it is well worth the purchase and a very good read."
5,One of my top 5 books!!!,"I have always wondered what certain spiritual things are really like : Heaven, demons, warfare, etc. This book made it all very real to me in a way few books have. Mr. Joyner definitely has been given a gift. His visions bring the importance of true Christian living to the forefront. This volume contains the first 2 books, The Final Quest and The Call. I have yet to read the 3rd book, The Torch and the Sword, but it is definitely on my list. And make sure you read The Shack as well. Another excellent book!"
1,Not worth buying,"I would not recommend it to anyone. Rick Joyner sometimes is talking in circles when his ""visions"" include having conversations with God, or others, and does not seem to be going anywhere. It's not worth wasting your money or time."
3,Cute but useless,"I love cows. That's why I bought this, but it's pretty useless. I can't tell how much time I have when turning the dial. So, don't count on not burning your cookies with this. Get this just for show."
1,waste of money,Don't waste your money. I bought this for my boys for the beach and it didn't even last the vacation. It is cheaply made and doesn't fly. You can make a paper airplane and get similar quality!
2,Not like the older kaleidoscopes!,"It's just O.K. Wouldn't purchase it again because the colors are not vivid enough--they are made out of (what else?) --plastic--not like the old kaleidoscopes which we used to play with for hours, which had metal pieces that moved around and gave much more vivid patterns."
1,X-ray glasses,"It came missing the part that goes behind your ear, so they are useless.Don't buy. Thought it would be a funny item, but it's junk."
3,i had a bad experience,the first thing i did was open the package and put them on and i saw stars as i hit my elbow trying to put my hand in the light trying to see my bones one things for sure youd see threw anything if you imagin realy hard trying to see with the glasses
5,My Morning Sickness Cure!,"My Mother swears by these for digestive uses. So when I was having morning/all day sickness, she suggested them. I eat one or a half before and after a meal and thank goodness, I have kept everything down for the past 3 days!!! Hopefully spicyness will not bother baby, but momma is finally eating!!!"
5,How am I the first to review this?! It's amazing.,"I can't believe I'm the only person so far to review this CD on Amazon. It's a brilliant album. I don't listen to a lot of metalcore because it's all so samey and generic. This album is truly creative and unpredictable, with memorable stand-alone songs and riffs. The musicianship is superb. It fuses old-school hardcore with metalcore. It has punk-style singing and metalcore shouts, but no pretty boy singing like much modern metalcore (thankfully). The cover of the Rolling Stones' ""Paint it Black"" is great (hard for that song not to sound great). All in all, if you like creative heavy punk or metal, get this. I just looked them up tonight to see if they had any other albums and I'm seriously bummed that they broke up awhile ago. Unsung greatness."
2,evaluation,"It didn't really taste at all like caviar, salty and fishy. I would prefer the lumpfish caviar we've had to this."
3,Smooth and mild,"If you're new to caviar or don't like overly fishy tastes, this is a fine pick. I prefer stronger taste and larger eggs. With better caviars, a little goes a long way. With this, you'll use larger portions - luckily, it's inexpensive enough to do so."
4,Delicious!!!,"I sent this as a birthday gift to a girlfriend that absolutely loves Caviar, and celebrates appetizer Fridays every week. I called to ask her how she liked it and her response was ""Delicious""!! We are retired flight attendants and in our previous life enjoyed the best of the Beluga,carried home personally by either one of us. On fixed income we can no longer afford the Beluga, purchased locally.She stated that it was not only tasty but the salt was not overpowering and she was thrilled with the 4 pack for it afforded her 4 Fridays.Sent with the Mother of Pearl serving spoon and the iceing server it was the perfect elegant yet affordable gift. I will purchase the Caviar for myself in the future.My only concern was the packing. The box did not indicate it was perishable, nor was it contained in ice. I had to call her and advise what was in the package for she's known for storing gifts until her actual day.The Caviar was no surprise, however the server shipped separately was."
4,not too bad at all...,"the first thing i have to say is that Cultivate is an awesome song. the second thing is, these guys didnt really makes their sound what it was until they met a major record company. but for the first cd they made... this is pretty good in my book."
1,Blah.,Great. A bad band puts out a bad album of their old bad release just to remind people how bad they are. NEXT!
4,time for some loud lo-fi top notch punk rock & a humour too,"The Sex Pistols are not as polished and as tight here as they are on their only official album, ""Never Mind the Bollocks..."" and some fans may find that a good thing. I think both are equally good. The performance of ""Anarchy in the UK"" is the loudest, fastest most growling version I've heard. Almost as entertaining is the bonus disc which features radio interviews done on the day of the last gig for the original Sex Pistols. Here, we hear Sid be at times brilliant, (""When there are no more blacks, whites, punks... ect."") sometimes trying to upstage Johnny (especially at the end of the interview, John sounds really [mad] about this.) and sometimes downright scary (""Him (Johnny) and I will probably dead in two years."") We also hear all the Pistols take the ... out of Americans, Pete Townshend, groupies and former band member Glen Matlock. This won't be essential to everyone but major Sex Pistols fans will get a lot of enjoyment out of this."
5,Can a soundtrack really be this good?,"Well, yes. This is simply the ultimate in surreal mood music. Lynch and Baladamenti will float you away on a bluesy wave of melancholy. The third song on the album has Jimmy Scott singing ""The Sycamore Trees"" -- a special import to this soundtrack from Twin Peaks' last episode. ""A Real Indication"" has Badalamenti himself supplying the lyrical equivalent of an out-of-the-body experience. Then Julie Cruise makes an appearance with ""Questions In A World of Blue,"" Laura Palmer's tragic goodbye. Then the album moves into a brief but terrifying trip through hell with ""The Pink Room"" and ""The Black Dog Runs at Night."" And finally the whole dizzying ride levels out with some of that good old Twin Peaks slowdance, music for sweet dreams."
2,he shoulda stopped at five...,"Poulet's anemic tone doesn't help these ordinary Romantic era violin concertos. Listen to Misha Keylin play Vieuxtemps' extraordinary concertos No.1-4 (on Naxos) and Sarah Chang play No. 5 (on EMI) for comparison. It's understandable that a chauvinistic music society would publish the No.'s 6 and 7 for completeness sake, but he shoulda stopped at five...Update 11-03: Keylin has recorded No. 5-7 on Naxos - he breathes life into the so-so No. 6 and 7."
1,peace love and groove,"a great blue meanies album to have for any fan of the blue meanies. the 8 songs feel for free, dickory dock, night people. grandma shampoo, it doesn't matter, aquarium bong, brother free, and nude ain't crude are all amazing song."
3,Mediocre toy,"Kong, for the most part, makes great toys, however the rope on this toy is not for dogs who are strong chewers. My 40lb dog chewed the rope off of this kong in about two days. The toy is still usable because the kong is sturdy and durable but don't buy this toy with high hopes for the durability of the rope."
2,Poor tick control,"Purchased Bayer's K9 Advantix II for our 3 Golden Retrievers. Seems to do an excellent job of controlling fleas, but not ticks. After a walk a week ago in a rural area, we are still removing ticks from our dogs. Removed 35 from one dog alone. Maybe this stuff works for some folks, but not on our dogs...at least as a tick repellant."
1,WASTE OF MONEY (even though I only paid $9.99),"This is awful. You don't learn any real sentences nor do you learn anything about grammmar. All you learn are some VERY basic vocabulary words (yes, no, hello, etc). Oh, and a bunch of differnt kinds of food. You wouldn't have a clue how to string any of them together into a phrase, though! It's too simple to be of any use. Also, in my opinion, the program's male & female speaker often pronounce things rather differently, which is confusing (especially for tonal languages where intonation is very important). I could go on but I'll end with one more major problem: In languages that require a different ending to be added onto words depending on the speaker's gender, the program doesn't indicate that, rendering it useless for those particular languages (e.g., Thai). You can learn way more for free on the internet!"
2,heavy & repeatedly got wrong color shipped to me,"The set was heavier than I thought it would feel. I was very frustrated with the fact that I ordered the white set, but repeatedly got it in red despite contacting Amazon each time to ask them to correct the error. This item was taken off Amazon for awhile until they figured out what was happening; I just found that this item has been put back on and will contact Amazon to do an exchange."
3,Good Cd,"This CD is good, but personally, I think out of all of Madonna's CD's, 'Ray of Light' was absolutely the BEST!!"
4,awesome CD,"Bad Girl, In This Life, Words, Rain and Why's It So Hard are some of the best music of madonna's career and for those alone definitely worth buying this album. It's full of hip hop/dance tracks and r&b ballads."
5,ONE OF HER VERY BEST!!,"I bought this CD right after I bought I'm Breathless, so that alone made this Cd great. I hate reading so many reviews that say this is her worst album, its not, its her second best (first being Ray of Light). While I must agree that songs like Where Life Begins, Secret Garden, and Did you Do it go a little overboard, all the rest don't. Erotica has such an awesome beat that the lyrics just blank out sort of, if it wasn't for that beat the song would totally suck. Thief of Hearts reminds me of the Patrick Leonard/Madonna days, while Deeper and Deeper seems like a sequel to Vogue. Rain seems like it doesn't belong, as its message is about sex, but it doesn't come out that way at all. In This Life also seems like it doesn't fit, as sex and friends dieing are two completely different things. Words, Waiting, and Bye Bye Baby, oh plus Thief OF Hearts are mean and cruel, and sort of sexy, so they fit in perfectly, and complete the sexy and racy beat of ""Erotica""."
3,MADONNA GOES OVERBOARD.,"I love Madonna, yes I do, but this is her worst CD of her career. There are some good cuts like ""Deeper & Deeper"", ""Bad Girl"", and ""Rain"", but it loses it with R&B distortion, and overly explicit lyrics. Thank god for ""Ray of Light"", Madonnas best yet, this one misses the boat slightly......"
2,Not that good,"I bought this album after reading all these good reviews. What a waste. Erotica the song just sounds like a bad remake of Justify My Love. The rest of the songs aren't bad but hardly ground breaking like everyone here is saying. Bad Girl would be a great song if a better singer performed it, with Madonna it just sits there. Unless you're a die hard Madonna fan, this record isn't much to listen to."
3,Madonna's dark detour,"""Erotica"" isn't a bad pop CD, but I don't think it's Madonna's best. Musically, the album has kind of an early trip-hop sound that's sexy and edgy, but what the album seems to be missing is an emotional core. Despite her tough persona, Madonna's music has always had a warmth and sensitivity to it that seems to be lacking on this CD. Even ""Rain"", the album's one real romantic ballad, seems a little forced and cold. The album also overuses the kind of spoken word vocals that sounded good on ""Justify My Love"", but become boring after being used on almost every song on this CD. There are several good tracks: ""Erotica"" is creepily sexy, ""Bye Bye Baby"" is a fun dance track, ""Waiting"" aches of need and desire and ""Thief of Hearts"" is a nasty dis of a scheming girlfriend. But if you want to hear Madonna at her best, combining cutting edge dance music with sincere vocals, check out ""Ray of Light"" or ""American Life""."
5,S-E-X SELLS,"Madonna sells EROTICA as she starts a one-women sexual revolution. ""Erotica"" is Madonna's defining work of art, and in a body of work that has lasted twenty-five years that's no small accomplishment. This album came out at a perfect time in America when society was very sexually repressed and homophobic. Maybe this was a gift from Madonna to enlighten the masses. Why is this CD so perfect? Because it mixes just the right blend of pop, dance, and R&B to form what"
3,It does what I wanted it for.,"3 things suck about this, but not the scope itself. The tripod is a waste, the case it comes with doesn't fit well, and the covers for the lenses don't fit well. I tossed the case, the tripod, and have tape on the lense covers to keep them on in my pack. I do like that it is fairly small for its ability, and light weight."
1,"Nice Float, but valve won't shut.","I really like this float, but it won't stay inflated. The valve in the back won't stay closed so it keeps deflating. If it worked it would be a great float for the beach or pool."
4,A very fast-paced read!,"Plenty of books have been written about travel toother worlds. A Two-Edged Sword does a better-than-usualjob of showing how Wilkinson comes to grips withthe differences in the world he is transported to;how he learns to apply the strengths of his ownknowledge and experience, and how he handles hislimitations."
4,A book to share with others,"It took a while to convince our librarian to buy the book for the collection, but once the book arrived it made the rounds through the staff members before reaching the public shelves. Also, I gave it as a birthday gift to a friend who just bought a motorcycle.The book is quite a novelty. For someone who enjoys animal behavior, this was an unusual way to learn. For children, not only are the ""ewh, gross"" splat plates interesting, but Hostetler has included some activites and games to keep them busy."
3,ehh,"These sunglasses look good but the materials and construction are rather flimsy. They feel like they'll break about as quickly as the $8 types you can get at the drugstore.--Update 7/2008: Yup, they fell apart rather quickly."
5,Full Feature and Good Value,"This is the second pair of Bolle Anaconda's I have bought in recent months. One for myself and one for my son. Polarized, UVA/B, simple wraparound that stays on medium face, great for outdoors trail hiking and climbing, lake or stream fishing. Good value for the money. You can spend more and it would only be marginally better for general purpose eye protection."
5,Great pair and value,"First, the TNS polarized set runs about half off as compared to what you would find at your local mall. Amazing.... Amazon continues to offer excellent value and prompt shipping.I am coming from a set of larger (read fits more loosely) Wiley X sunglasses. I was afraid to depart from them, however after a couple of days I can say I am very happy with the anacondas. They fit my head much better, don't wiggle around when I'm active, and provide a very clear polarized view.No regrets here!"
5,I love them! A great fit and great optics.,"I needed a pair of driving glasses and I was fed up of rite aid cheapies. This pair appealed to me and the good reviews convinced me to get them. I've been using them for the last couple days in my truck and they lightly shade your eyes, removing the need for squinting and getting rid of road glare. These glasses are crystal sharp and I love that. I personally like a neutral gray shade and this what I was looking for. It also includes a case and cleaning cloth. The case is fantastic. I am able to keep it on my dashboard and it's easy to put the glasses away into a scratch-free cocoon.I highly recommend these glasses!"
2,Liked them while they lasted,"Only had them for a month before the frame cracked and one lens eventually fell out. Maybe I wasn't as careful with them as I should have been, but I've never had a pair of shades fall apart so quickly. What a waste of $$$."
3,Worth the read,"Like J.Foster in the review before mine, I found that some things were not explained well enough. There were enough gaps in the explanations of why certain things happened in the book to leave me scratching my head and wondering. The attempts to interweave various stories and historical sequences were pretty well done, but did leave me thinking that some of the plot intricacies were just not necessary to the story.However, there were some unique plot points and situations and vivid and interesting characters. The style is fast-paced and readable and the story did keep my interest throughout. Over all, I'd say this is worth the read. I didn't feel like I wasted my money and I'll definitely give any upcoming books a try!"
3,"safe, but not comfortable","This car seat is a great seat from a flexibility and safety standpoint, but not great if the child plans to sleep. My daughter could not keep her head up no matter how I positioned the base. Not sure i would recommend if your child is going to be in it for more than a short ride."
5,Blastin Saxon and Groovin Flutin,This one you can't miss! The flavor and rhythm are out of this world! Keenan can really groove. This one will set your mind at ease. His CD will really round out your jazz collection.
5,vanilla beans,These beans have an excellent smell and flavor. They came in record time. I will be using this company again.
5,More Rock than Kid,"As far as these Tribute albums go, this is by far the best. If you don't own any original Kid Rock albums then this is ideal, and if you do then this won't interest you anyway. The singer sounds a little similar to the guy on the ""Tribute to N Sync"" album - is there no end to his talents?"
1,wasted money,"I made the mistake of purchasing a series of 7 DVDs of Winkelman's katas. I have seen these katas performed better by yellow and orange belts. These disks are a total waste of money if you are looking for something to really show you proper form. they are fine as a refresher to remind you of the proper order of techniques, but nothing more than that. To see a supposed master walk through a kata rather than display proper form is shameful. Seiuchin kata performed without bent knees, some stance changes pivoted around a stationary leg instead of stepping through, Naihanchi kata walked through with back turned to attacker at times... too many mistakes to even list.my qualification? ni-kyu in Ishin Ryu, many years of doing these katas with a 7th dan who insists on perfection."
5,Truly amazed,"I have been a star wars fan ever since i was 5 and have read all the expanded universe books up to date, and with this one it was incredible. Allston is a truly gifted writer and this installment of the NJO was very well done. Im not going to spoil the book by tell anything about. Dont think about it just go out and buy it. Dont steal but cheat and lie if nessasry this book is worth the money."
4,Dark and psychedelic,"This is the most depressing album I've ever heard. It's like looking at the world through blue-colored glasses. Yet it's still cool sounding. The music is amazing! The guitars are off the wall with melody and rythm, the drums are furious and precise and the claustrophobic atmosphere created by the production all amount to a band going into self-induced trance where they channel dark forces of nature to keep from imploding.The lyrics just seem like gibberish to me, they just evoke feelings and scenes but the interpretation is mostly in your head.Unique.But be warned, this music is FATAL in its power of melancholy. Their friend and former band leader had just committed suicide so understandably they were in a mood of complete and utter despair when they made this album."
4,works too well,Bought this toy and lost it in two days. It flew more than 200ft and diasppeared behind some trees and shrub. Loved it!! Gonna buy two more!!
2,Body Glove Ion Mobile Phone Case for Nokia 3300 Series Phone,"I have owned this phone case for 4 weeks now.Pros: The case looks, feels and fits great. The accesability of the buttons and the phone display is wonderful through the clear plastic front on the case.Cons: The snap top covers the power switch of the phone. It is possible to turn the phone on and off without unsnapping the top cover, but it is difficult. I don't necessarily turn the phone on and off, but need to access the function of the button for silent mode. Also the belt clip does not secure the phone safely to my pants. This is my second phone case. I never had problems with the first case (not Body Glove) coming off of my pants. This new case has inadvertently unclipped from my pants 6 times (dropping one time into the toilet!). My fear of course is damaging or losing the phone."
1,this kit is junk,"I cannot copy anything onto the PVDs. My BURNER is good, as some have suggested other peoples burners were bad because this did not work...umm yeah I think you are LUCKY if it does.. it wouldnt let me copy valid format pictures, and when it goes to ""burn"" the music files the time clicks on the counter with no progress whatsoever..This product is junk."
1,Useful if you're in the US,"This would be a wonderful product and a little research shows that you can indeed order blank PVDs from the Hasbro web site by selecting 'replacement parts' in the customer service section..However, none of this is useful if you don't live in the US because Amazon won't shpi the Media Wizard software out of the country and Hasbro won't sell the blank PVDs out of the country."
1,Buyer beware!,"Unfortunately you CANNOT use mini cds instead of the PVDs. It may burn the disk, but if you put the mini disc into the video now player, the machine DOES NOT recognize it, and you will get an error message. According to Hasbro customer service, you can't purchase the PVDs separately anywhere, so if you want more PVDs, you will have to buy more of these kits. You can cut down regular Cds as another reviewer suggested. However, this is a tedious and difficult process. Overall, this is a good idea, but you have to wonder what Hasbro was thinking by not making these blank discs available for sale individually..."
4,works fine,"Received quickly, however had trouble getting it to function. No information to install had to contact Western Digital to get it to work."
2,cerwin2,This product needed to be more clear because it makes it look lie it is a SATA drive but it is actually a IDE. But it did come in a reasonable time. But as I said they need to spend more time describing the product so people don't mistake it for something useful.
2,Only a 30gig drive???,"I attempted to format and install this drive (80gig 7200) last night and the computer saw it as only a 30gig drive??? The bios read it as a 30gig drive and the Linux Mandrake install saw it as only having 30 as well. I don't know what could be the problem, I will try installing it on another pc to see what happens. It doesn't seem anyone else has had this problem, I will research a little more, in the mean time, buyers beware!"
3,Fair reference guide,"I've used this book as a reference guide to TV shows in general, not as a guide to which shows are out on video (and, of course, the video element is now obsolete, with the arrival of DVDs). The book is arranged in categories such as comedy and drama, with the individual programs alphabetized within. For each show, there is a cast list for the major characters, a few credits, a few behind-the-scenes paragraphs, and a few bits of trivia. Most shows comprise three or four pages, and black-and-white photos are included."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS IF YOU HAVE A MAC,"I got this router last week with hope that build-in QoS and two auto balance WAN port would improve my companys network. After I install it on our network. 3 out of 25 windows machine can not get an IP address no matter how I tried. 4 MAC machine with OSX Tiger can't get an IP address either. I tried manully setup MAC machine with manul assign IP address but still can't go on to Internet. After spending whole day to try to reslove those two issue and been watting on phone for an hour to get LINKSYS techsuport. Which turns out that those INDIA tech guy gave me a ""We have no training of APPLE COMPUTER,so we can't help you, you should call APPLE for HELP!"" how lame can it be? That is it, I packed it up and send it back. Besides that, If you have Novell Netware Server on your network, avoid this router too, cause some of our company computer can't log in!"
1,Batteries?,I can take two (2) pictures without using the instant review function and my batteries run dry. Tech support at Hewlett Packard says this is normal. I find it highly excessive.I'm not sure if I'll keep this camera.
4,Misleading Review,Larry Roses's review is totalling misleading. I got the product. It does have rechargeable batteries as an available accessory (which I purchased). You can also get an AC adapter. Everything else works at the level I would expect for an entry level digital camera to be used to capture photos for email and web page use.
4,GREAT first time camera,I purchased this camera and it takes some really good pictures considering the small price.I liked the software much better than a more expensive camera that I have now.For everyday snapshots this camera works great.It does eat up the batteries VERY FAST.I used a AC adapter with mine wish ... was well worth it.Don't be afraid of this camera as it is simple to use and takes some good pictures.
3,"OK, could be better","Like all digitals, these eat up batteries by the dozen. For this camera, I suggest getting NIMH rechargeables. These work the best for me. Also, get a better MC. Sandisk or Viking are good bets."
1,Highly Unreliable Performance,"The on/off button is so poorly designed that you can't help switching it on by accident. By the time you decide to take a picture, of course the power will have been drained. Even if you take care of this piece of (...)like precious jewelry, you still need to avoid using any flash light and/or LCD display, for otherwise you will have to wait like 20 seconds for the battery to recharge before you can shoot another one. This would still not have been a problem if the camera could indicate the remaining recharge time. However, since the camera keeps the user in the dark, the user has no choice but to keep pressing the button until the camera takes the picture. More often than not, the timing is awkward; and the results, disastrous. Don't let this happen you."
2,Do not recommend,"I bought the camera at the original price and completley regret it. It's no longer working after 3 months and I am going to have to pay even more to repair it. I would suggest investing a little more money into something different, at least a different name brand."
3,It's so good to remember the good ole days...,"Nothing major, but it is a good taste of the most powerful and aggressive genre ever."
1,"src not working, low-low-low.. level tech",src is trival coding and also not working.How can this book be the developer guide. what a shame. waste money and your time.
2,"I am a HUGE Blink182 Fan, but this movie sucks.","I am like the hugest Blink182 fan. When I heard they made this movie, I was stoked! I love Blink182, and I thought this would be a rad video. So I watched one day. I regret ever watching it. Its about pornstar, Kira Reed talking about how she worked with Janine. This British singer from a band was talking about shows he has been to, and what punk music is. They were also showing facts you already knew! No videos, no concerts, no music, just talking. You saw Blink182 atleast 6 times throughout the whole video. I would buy, ""Uretha Chonricals"" instead of this. I love Blink182, but this just NOTHING about Blink182. So take my advice, and don't buy this movie!"
5,The Perfect Phone Case,I looked every where for a case for my new 8260 Nokia Phone. This one is by far the most durable and best looking.
1,These are not heavy absorbency pads,"Despite the product name ""Durasorb Disposable Underpads, Heavy Absorbency"", the ones sold by Direct Care Store are actually Moderate absorbency. It actually says ""moderate"" on the box that it comes in. Purchased for an elderly woman, the use of 1 pad for overnight protection results in wet sheets in the morning. I have to use 2 pads on top of each other to protect the sheets. While speaking with Direct Care, they verify that the pads I received were the ones I ordered. They were polite enough to offer to take them back but I would have to ship them myself. Fedex ground would be 4x the cost of the item so I will not be shipping them back.In summary, It is a bad product with a deceptive description. I would purchase from the company again only if I have tried the product previously and knew I would not be disappointed."
1,That is one bat that should have stayed in hell,"If I truly wanted to hear a poor rendition of Meat Loaf's music, I would record myself singing these songs."
3,WILLO 2K1,"ARMOND WHITE HASN'T GOT A CLUE. IF YOU WANT A GOOD BIOGRAPHY OR AUTOBIOGRAPHY FIND ONE THAT IS WRITTEN BYE ONE OF TUPAC'S FRIENDS OR FAMILY. THE ONLY GOOD THING ABOUT THIS BOOK IS THE TIME LINE AT THE BACK OF THE BOOK AND THE QUOATES AND LYYRICS FROM TUPAC'S SONGS. TUPAC WAS A GREAT MAN AND RAPPER HE WENT THREW HARD TIMES AND ALWAYS PULLED THREW. IF YOU ARE ALIVE COME BACK BECAUSE EMINEM WRECKS HEAD, HE'S WHITE BUT HE WANTS TO BE BLACK AND HE HASN'T GOT A CLUE. IF YOU ARE DEAD REST IN PEACE WHERE EVER YOU ARE.TUPAC RULES 4EVA."
5,Rebel for the hell of it ; the life of Tupac Shakur,"I loved the book. I thought it gave a great perspective on the life of Tupac Shakur. I especially liked the time line in the back of the book. The quotes and lyrics from the songs gave a feeling for Tupac's personality. You could really get a good view of Tupac's struggles and triumphs. I loved the book and I love Tupac's music. In my opinion the book deserves 5 stars. The story of Tupacs life will never die! Instead of mourning his death, we should celebrate his life."
5,Will the final three seasons of Green Acres also be released on DVD??,"Thanks for the DVD release of the Third Season of Green Acres, but what about the final three seasons?? It doesn't seem like MGM is in a hurry to finish releasing the show on DVD does it?? By comparison, Paramount will soon release the sixth season of The Andy Griffith Show on DVD. Green Acres remained consistently funny throughout the six seasons it aired on CBS and there were many worthwhile episodes during the last three seasons that are well-deserving of a DVD release. I for one hope it happens very soon!!"
5,Great Camera at a Great Price.,"I paid [money] for this camera and couldn't be more thrilled. I did not do as some have done during ratingas as my rating was based on price/performance. While there are many cameras out there with better features, none beat this camera in price/performance ratio. You can set the camera for high resolution and it will take fantastic, detailed pics. You can set it for low res and save almost 700 photos on a 64 mb Compactflash card.(Not included, but cheap). If you are planning on using zoom then you will need to spend more money and get optical zoom.The digital zoom leaves a little to be desired but I didn't buy this for zooming. Therefore it gets a 5 out of 5."
1,Lousy Singing + Playing is not a Tribute to The Carpenters!,"Well if you want to hear some boring playing and awful singing I recommend this so called Tribute to The Carpenters CD. The Lead singer has no range, no enthusiasm and a knack for going off key whenever she tries a tiny bit of range in her voice. Not one song is done interestingly. Well it did have one good affect on me. Even though The Carpenters are already my favorite group, listening to this, drove me to put on some of the real Carpenters CD's and appreciate just how great they are even more than ever."
2,Not what I expected,"I purchased this for my granddaughter who's only 2, but I thought this would introduce her to Shirley Temple as the singing, dancing child we all loved. I thought it would at least hold her attention for that reason. It turns out that Shirley is only one of many characters in the skits. She isn't really singled out and the concept of the stories are more like Spanky and our Gang than what I remember about Shirley Temple stories. Very disappointed. If you want the real Shirley Temple experience, don't buy this."
1,poor quality,"I was wholy unimpressed with this item, and wish I'd returned it.The metal at the top of the helm is bent, and unfortunately I didn't unpack and inspect this item soon enough to do anything about it."
3,Lil' rob is a pretty sick ass chicano rapper,Good cd buy it with a name you cant touch>. LIL ROB BROWN PRIDE ALL THE WAY!!! SD SOCAL Go PADRES
2,This Needs to End,Having purchased all of the transporter movies. I have to say this is most disappointing. There's a lot of bad acting and the dialogue just stinks. While I enjoyed Jason Statham is this movie. This movie has truly run it course. Please No Transporter 4.
3,High kicking fun,"The 3rd instalment of the Transporter series follows on in the same style as the previous two. Outrageous fights and car chases, tongue firmly in cheek and Jason Statham showing that if not a great, or even good actor he has an undoubted talent for this sort of role. In this instalment he is unknowingly helping in the kidnapping of a politicians daughter to try and make the politician sign an agreement with a company that transports polluted waste to countries.Robert Knepper as Johnson plays the main villian and is perhaps the pick of the rest of the cast. He's a ruthless man who doesn't take no for an answer and even kills his own men when they question him.So once again this isn't a classy film, but for simple entertainment, which doesn't take itself very seriously its a perfectly fine way to spend 95 minutes. I still think two is the best of the three films."
3,"Decent action, but not as good as the first two installments","Transporter 3 is a decent action flick, although the first two movies do it all better. The premise for the story is actually pretty good, but the lead actress is very annoying, and there seems to be an emphasis on action sequences that require Statham to lose his shirt. I guess they had to pander to the audience. The action sequences don't break any new ground from the first two movies, but they are fun to watch.If you are on a budget, get the Transporter 1 and 2 Collection. That's reliable, solid entertainment."
1,Transport yourself AWAY from this movie,"I almost NEVER write reviews. But I love humankind enough to try to save a few people. I didn't even buy this one. I rented it from the Red Box for $1. I feel SO RIPPED OFF!This movie has NO PLOT at all. There is a 3 minute scene between the two leads talking about what they'd like to eat.And then there's the ""action"" if that's what you want to call it. Everything was choreographed worse than the Britney Spears performance at the VMA's.Why are there 30 bad guys against 1 good guy, and the bad guys always go 1 at a time?Do yourself a favor and DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE!!!"
2,TOXIC WASTE OF A MOVIE,"It looks like Jason is becoming the new Steven Segal. A new movie every 3 months good or bad!!! Glad this was a free rental or I would have been ticked. Since it was free I didn't expect a whole lot and I wasn't disappointed. There was barely an excuse to get Jason in the car a 3rd time{hopefully the last} and some very poorly filmed martial arts scenes. The film is speeded up so fast it's hard to see what's going on, and people complain about Hong Kong fights??? I like Jason in some movies but the last 2 Transporter movies were dumb to me . Blitz wasn't very good either. Jason is getting by on his early films for now but that won't go on much longer. Pretty soon it will be straight to cable."
3,good service,The movie itself wasn't worth it but the service was great...the item was pre-ordered and arrived within the next 2 days and wasn't expected to get to me until four days after it was purchased.
3,Good for what was advertised.,Just like the other reviewers said i got the magnetic ping pong balls compared to what was in the picture.Overall not a bad buy
5,A wonderful series,"This series was certainly cancelled too soon. It's a cluster of superb actors and actresses telling an ongoing story of each individual's haunting past and the comradery which exists between them in dealing with the affect the past has on the current lives they lead. If you enjoy western type films, this is a must for your library."
1,76 minutes gone.,"I bought this junk. This movie goes on and on. The kids are freaks but WE as the viewer will never know why. There is some gore, but forget about seeing any. There is a quick shot of the crucified cat... mom and dad are drugged... but again, why??? The best part of the movie was the end. Only because it was over!"
1,TD needs affection,"Laurence Connors in the introduction of his excellent ""Advanced Trading strategies"" mentions two of the most important characteristics of successful trading. Strategies must be simple and one's ego cannot come in the way. This book is exactly the opposite. A desperate attempt to impress with verbosity, numerous trademarks, deliberate complexity of what could have been perhaps enlightning analysis if presented by someone really wanting to pass on a message. As said elsewhere, ""insufferable"" is the thought that pops up at every page. I am only surprised that the pages are not numbered and patented as TD Page1, TD page2,etc.. such is the spirit of this useless book."
2,Poorly Written Book,"The indicators may or may not be useful (I haven't tried them), but DeMark needs to learn how to write. He has long, wordy descriptions of his indicators with almost no formulas or examples. I have to read the descriptions several times and even then I'm often not sure what he is trying to do. The book is full of run-on sentences with 5 or more clauses each; it has more commas than periods. He describes how many indicators work for both increasing and decreasing prices in one sentence, switching back and forth between the two in a very confusing manner.I think he has good ideas about indicator construction and if you can get through his horrible English the book is probably useful."
3,Poorly Written,"This is an extremely convoluted book that takes a Philadelphia lawyer to figure out. Mr. DeMark launches right into extremely technical applications of his different trademarked bar identification codes without first giving the slightest clue to basic structure and premise of his bar identification counts. This book is quite expensive too, even through a discount seller such as Amazon. To be retained by such fabled traders as Paul Jones, Leon Cooperman, Steve Cohen and others it makes me wonder if they couldn't figure out bar his count system either and the only way to find out was to hire him? This is a sophisticated technique with anything of the slightest technical nature. To make it so complex the publisher can't figure out what he is publishing and the reader has to think the writer is pretty smart because he sure as hell can't figure out what he is writing about. I cannot recommend this book. Save your money."
4,Detailed Technical Analysis,"This is a sequal to his earlier book, ""The New Science of Technical Analysis."" It is detailed though not easy reading. It is an excellent lesson in how to apply technical analysis from one of the most successful traders. I would consier it ""must reading"" for anyone trading commodies as well as equities. You should have a basic knowledge of technical analysis prior to reading the book."
5,works,"so i had some hard brown sugar. Got the sugar bear and used as per instructions. now it is like new again, nuff said, it works."
2,The Untold Story of Terri Schiavo's death,"I found this book to be very boring, considering I've read otherbooks by Mark Furman and was fascinated!It took way too long to get through this book. didn't grab me right away."
1,"Now, for something completely pedestrian...","JC General, your negative points about what Mr. Fuhrman didn't cover and your negative comments aren't appreciated. Instead, I will focus on Mr. Fuhrman's most shockingly brilliant observations:1) When Sen. Dr. Mr. Bill Frist meant when he said that the blind Terri Schiavo was ""responding to visual stimuli"" was that her ""inner eye"" or ""third eye"", as it were, was responding to the Great Tunnel of Light that we all we see when the Good Lord takes us up in His Heaven for our Great Reward.2) Terri Schiavo, in fact, was not brain dead or even brain-damaged and proved it by writing President Bush's 2003 State of the Union Address.3) OJ Simpson is still guilty."
5,excellent...,"Its about time someone wrote the truth.I remember a debate in the comments on another website last year about the moral issues in the case, where one of Michael Schiavo's supporters was asked why, ""if Terri really was nothing more than an insensate husk, it was necessary to starve her to death before bringing her to the crematorium. Why not just toss her in as is?""The response of Michael Schiavo's supporter: ""why not indeed?""This is why this book is so important. More books why Michael and his supports are dead wrong need to come out in order to show the travesty of justice putting Terri to death was.Imagine, we have 11 million illigal immigrants getting in to have enough pay and food to live, and Michael, his ghoulish lawyer, and the disgusting judges all conspired to put her to death simply because she was not perfect. whats up with that?"
1,Power of Attorney/Living Will,"Mark Fuhrman was a contributing factor as to why OJ got off for killing his wife? So why would anyone think that he is that great of a detective when he shows bias and is in it for the national headlines and the almighty buck! Putting that aside, Terri Schiavo and her family are the unfortunate victims of our society sticking their noses where they do not belong. And if any good comes from this horrifying public media event it should be on an educational level, no matter how old or young we are to please make out a power of attorney and a living will so that your family does not have to go through what poor Terri Schiavo's family has gone through for 15 years!!!!!!! And remember that these decisions are made across our Nation on a daily basis, it is not that uncommon so if you want a say please put it in writing, just telling someone is not good enough."
2,Great case...for a few months,"I've had this case for less than half a year. I really liked the look and feel of the case. However, after about 4 months the case started to peel at the corners. After that it quickly disintegrated, tears and pieces of the outer layer falling off. Also the plastic covering the display blocks the up arrow and part of the menu button on the 5165.I would not buy this again"
1,Didn't Want Swivel clip in 1st place,"I had privious experience with the body glove cell suit and I loved it, When it came time to get another one I found that they had switched to the swivel type clip. I did not want this clip and searched for an alternative, but did not find one. Reluctantly I purchased this cellsuit. It has been four months now and the clip has broken twice. I contacted Fellowes the maker and they are switching back to the static clip. Wait for that type of clip and you will be very happy with this phone cover."
4,Regalo Double Sided Bed Rails,"Since we have two granddaughters who were ready to move to a big bed, We need these to help keep the children from falling out of bed. When broke, I called the company and cheerfully send a replacement part."
3,Seems good for now.,When was putt ng t together the sl d peace was bent so not happy about that. hope t wors
4,Bed rail,"I like the bed rails, but I think the instructions could have been written a little easier. I like them because I have a 18 month old grandson who spends one night a week with me and I started when he was little, putting him in bed with me. So after he fell out of bed one night. That did it!I started looking for bed rails. I like them because they are very affordable and you can tuck them under the mattress when I'm not using them. Trina P."
4,Good overall,"Setting up is not hard, but does take a little bit of effort.We have a total of 5 of these (after the first one the assembly was a piece of cake) andthey work well to keep the kids in their beds."
3,Hard to operate,"I needed a double sided bed rail and found this one. One problem I encountered is that it can only work properly when you have a box spring mattress, which it doesn't specify you should have on the product review and the knobs you are supposed to pull to lower the rail are almost impossible to pull back or to put back in their holes, very frustrating. So now I just keep the bed rails up all the time."
5,perfect,My husband and I put this together in no time at all and our daughter used it last night for the first time. The best part is that the sides easily go down and under the mattress so her bed doesn't look like a hospital bed. Love this product!
3,Regalo Hide Away Double Bed Rail,"The instructions are impossible to read and understand I suggest you look at the pictures more so than the words. It's not hard to put together just hard to understand what they are wanting you to do. It seems sturdy but I was dissapointed that it fits together under the bed with straps. I really wanted one that fit together wtih metal tubes, but with the weight of the mattress I think it seems sturdy enough for her to roll over too and not fall off. I am however concerned with the height. It's not as tall as I would have hoped, even when she is laying down."
1,Garbage,"I purchased these because we have a bed that is low to the ground and drop-down rails are too tall for our bed. I thought it would be handy to be able to store them under the bed instead and keep them out of site. It would be great if they actually worked.Flimsy construction, these rails do not slide easily in and out - they get stuck and it is a struggle to get them in our out every time, which is also noisy! They stick and don't slide. There is also a gap between the bed and rail, even if you tighten them. Struggling with them is also very noisy, which is not helpful when there is a baby sleeping in the bed."
2,Not enough info to make a purchase,"I looked at this set of rails and another one. What made me buy the other one was the information included the bed sizes the rails would work with!If you want to sell me a product, please make sure all the info I need is there! This is one piece I needed as I am putting this on my 5 year olds double bed."
4,best if it doesn't ....,I wish there was something besides Velcro to hold the top closed but I might just be being picky. I love the leather look and I bought it even though I don't have my Ipod yet. (I get it Thursday)But I have been looking for the right case for two weeks and I think this is the one for me. I hope the click wheel works through the vinyl sleeve. I will let you know later.
2,Not like the pictures!,I bought these for the front & rear of a new 2008 GMC Sierra pickup. They do not look like the pictures on the websites or the picture on the box. They fit the contour of the pickup well but one of the holes in the front mud guards is in the wrong location. I drilled new holes in the mud guards in the correct location. I had to remove the rear wheel and drill 4 holes to install each of the rear mud guards.
2,Strange and Depressing,I did not like the video because I did not enjoy it. The story seemed very strange and it left me feeling very conflicted and depressed.
2,"Could have been good, but fell short","Interesting concept, but poorly executed. Also, who told these people they could act? I would recommend passing on renting this one."
2,Exploitative thriller,"This is a vacuous and sensationalistic film that seemed simply to exploit sex and violence for thrills. Each scene competes with the previous scene for gruesomeness and obscenity, mostly with no discernible point other than titillation.The plot concerns a gay cop forced out of the closet while investigating a gay serial-killer. Little is left to the imagination as young men are raped, tortured, crucified and dismembered. The ending is bleak and crass."
1,disappointing,"If your have read Reiner's other books and watched some of the movies he has written then you expect more than this book has to offer. It is a real disappointment and it seems that Reiner is just in on it for the money. I've also never seen so many typos and misspelled words in a book. You don't find out very much about Reiner and his life and some of the stories are not even funny and you wonder why he is sharing them with you. I'm a huge Reiner fan and had ordered this book several month in advance and really looked forward to it. While reading some of the chapters I even found out that he was still writing the book at a time where you could already order it online. Perhaps he run out of time and ideas in the end. Hopefully, someone will some day write a real biography about Carl Reiner. The man has much more to tell and share than this books reveals. True fans will be disappointed."
3,An Amusing but not Hilarious Memoir,"Mr. Reiner is undoubtedly a funny man but the full force of his humor is not to be seen in My Anecdotal Life. It is a likable, amusing and easy reading book but the stories are sometimes obscure and the punchlines sometimes don't justify the build-up. The professional period that he is perhaps best known for, the Dick Van Dyke show era, is lightly covered -- much to my disappointment. Another flaw is that there is no index. Books like this name-drop and half the fun is to see who and who isn't mentioned. Sadly, there are no old photos either. As Mr. Reiner intimates, much of the book flows from many years of dinner party repartee. You will like this book but only the most devoted fans will love it."
3,"Lower purity than described, but a good product","I was disappointed that this product was not the one pictured. The product pictured is 99.85% pure. The product I received was in a different kind of packaging, and only 99% pure. For most this won't matter. For my purposes, it does to an extent- but not enough for me to say I won't buy again. The price is a fair one for a 99% purity DMSO product. If I can't find better purity at a reasonable price, I will purchase this product again. For the discriminating chemist out there, this is not your product if you are looking for the accuracy of a 99% pure product."
4,dmso,"This is very strong, I had to dilute it with distilled water , approx. 70/30%. Works well for me. I use it on my elbow and shoulder. Remember to wash area first, and use a clean cotton ball."
1,I should have known better,"I read the reviews, most of them bad but a few good reviews so I bought the product and all the other suggested accesories like the blow up eye balls and the sparkling paper strips(all-in-all around $200 worth of crap). I cleaned my barn, free of all nests and hung the products up and plugged in the expeller. It is quite annoying of a sound. Four months have passed since I began using these products and I have four nests in the barn again and bird droppings just like it was before. I am better off with my $37 Red Ryder BB gun. It at leaast scatters the birds for a little while."
2,"1 Good, 1 Bad","This CD is imported from Russia. The ""Plays Pretty Just For You"" seems to be a valid stereo version of the original album. ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"", however, is a mess. It is not in stereo, and only contains approximately 25 minutes of the original 35 minute album. All selections are incomplete and the ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"" selection is only 4:28 compared to the original 2-part selection lasting 9:27. A real rip-off. The original selections from ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"" are currently only available from iTunes."
1,Monstrously nonfunctional,"I purchased the Monster iCarPlay Wireless Plus FM transmitter/charger for my son's new iPod. He tried it out today for several hours, and he states the item does not work. If he finds a station that works clearly (a challenge in itself), it is only temporarily and then he either gets only hiss through the stereo or he gets no sound whatsoever, even when the iPod continues to show that it is functioning (not in pause). This was the situation repeatedly at various locations around town. The packaging for this item is such that it must be opened in a destructive manner (i.e., cannot be restored to original condition). It was necessary to open the item to find out about its serious functionality deficit; it was either of poor design or defective. I think under those circumstances, the 15% restocking fee was unfair."
3,Less than wonderful,"I had bought this item after several days of research on FM transmitted and I will have to say that I am less than impressed. First, the digital display was messed up within a couple of weeks of purchase, though that wasn't much of a problem because it was still fairly easy to tune. Also, it has a hard time overpowering many radio stations, even ones with static. I live in a small suburban area and it is very hard to find a totally dead FM station which provided static free music more than 75% of the time. In addition, the wire for the charge is very sensitive. After only 9 months of daily use, I found that one of the wiring componetns became loose and I would loose the right audio channel. This product would be good for infrequent use, such as on long road trips, but doesn't stack up well to daily handling."
2,Crackle crackle whineeeee,"This Monster starts strong and fades away.The first month of use, no problems (other that it's hard as nails to find a ""blank"" radio station in Seattle).Second month, the crackling starts creeping in, as well as a high pitched whine that follows the rev of the engine.I put up with the whining and crackles for a few months as they got worse until the point came where I avoided listening to my iPod in the car! I'd rather listen to CD's than the piercing, crunching death of my music.... And so my fading monster transmitter is now in the trash, and I'm once again looking for something reliable.(wish me luck or send a suggestion)"
3,So so....,It works so so..... Some static is detectable. Benefit of charging the ipod while in use in the car.
1,Poor sound quality and interference when it heats up,"This transmitter has very poor sound quality, especially after it heats up. When the cord is moved slightly, loud interference is heard. In addition, the transmitter has very little oompf and is thus susceptible to external noise sources. Buy the Kensington transmitter instead. It is far superior."
2,There are better ways...,"I have tried 3 different Ipod adapters in my wife's car, and one more in my truck. The Monster cable works well enough but its biggest drawback is that it's very difficult to change the channel. Unlike some other transmitters that have simple up/down buttons, the Monster cable needs to be reprogrammed to change channels, which you can't do while driving."
1,Pretty useless in NorthWest (UK),I live in Manchester(UK) and commute to Bolton.For this area the device is useless.There are NO free frequencies common across the area.There are few that were *passable* in Manchester and fewer *passable* in Bolton (and they weren't the same)!It just isn't possible to use.[passable - there's someone frying chips in the background]
3,It only works half the time,I bought this product on Amazon used for about half off the original price from a highly rated seller. It arrived quickly and appeared in great condition. I plugged it in and it didn't work. Then it worked - then it went haywire. So far I've enjoyed a few songs on it but it wasn't worth the money.
4,Monster Wireless FM,Bought it for my wife.She uses it with her Ipod in the car.The product works well as advertised. It is easy to set it up and it charges itself and the Ipod in the car !!!Very easy to manipulate
4,great accessory,"Thhis transmitter/charger is perfect for listening to the iPod in your car, especially on long trips. There is sometimes an issue with radio stations competing for the same frequency that is being used, but, fortuantely, you can change the frequency and not be limited to only 4. My only beef about this item is that the LED is very hard to see in the daytime. And for some reason, the transmitter has been quitting now and then... But overall, it's great."
1,Don't think you are smarter than the reviews (Like I did),"We have tried every possible way to find a station that this product will play on. Static is all we hear. I did not listen to the bad reviews because I wanted this to work so badly.I got burned, so all I can say is save your money, unless you need something else to store in your coffee cup holder."
1,Pretty Bad,"I have an Acura MDX this equipment makes my Ipod sound like a 1970's transistor radio. No channel works well. I have since bought the Griffin Road Trip that has the grey plastic platform and sticks out of the cigarette lighter socket. It is less attractive but at least it holds the music steady on 88.1 FM. There is an annoying whine underneath the music but the music comes through loud and clear and if you play it loud you don't hear the whine. Blue Tooth, Apple are you listening? We needa better system to connect the Ipods to car stereos!"
2,A big disappointment...,"I was very unhappy with this transmitter. The sound quality is pretty bad, but the biggest frustration with it is the fact that if you have a skin on your iPod, it's near impossible to remove/reattach this. The only plus is that it charges your iPod. I recently purchased a cassette adapter and the sound quality is SOOO much better."
3,"Maybe OK, probably not.","This may be OK for some people if you can find a good station to play it on. I can't find anything in my area that was free of interference enough to be usable, and in most cases I can't even hear it at all. It worked a little better when I retracted the antenna on my car, but I don't want to do that every time I want to listen.My old iTrip worked much better until it finally broke on me."
1,Worst than the iTrip,I've owned the iTrip when I had my 2nd Gen iPod. I needed a new FM transmitter when I bought the 4th Gen and the Monster Cable iCarPlay doesn't cut it. I wasn't very happy with my iTrip but this product is even worse.
1,The sound quality of these FM transmitters is completely unacceptable,"This is the second one I am returning. If you are listening to music with an in-dash single speaker in your 74 Ford Pinto, maybe the sound is ok. I have the premium system from Ford in my Explorer, which is a good stock system, but these FM transmitters sound like mono AM sound to me. I tried a number of stations and the signal came through fine, but the sound quality is about a 3 on a scale of 10. I'm gonna have to replace my car receiver just to get something I can plug my new iPod into and get decent sound. I can't keep burning hundreds of CDs and carrying them around in the car."
1,Does not work well in the Atlanta Georgia area,Too much static on any of its very limited choices (for some reason Monster does not start at the bottom of the FM band). I even took off my FM antenna from the hood of the car and still had way too much static. I tried every thing I could think off but the static is still bad (if your iPod moves or you touch the cable the static gets worse). I switched to the Sony cassette adapter for much better sound.
3,Ok iPod wireless interface,"I bought this product because it had a more flexible intallation than the others. It allows the iPod to be moved around and shared in the car. The unit is also quite attractive in its looks. I have two problems with the unit. 1) The sound is poor; 2) The number of FM presets is limited, and thus in the Boston area finding a sustainiable workable frequency has been a problem."
1,1 Star is 1 Too Many,"Evidently I have to select 1 star out of 5 to rate this item. 1 star is one too many. This transmits terribly and is staticky even in the middle of the desert where there are no other stations.On the clearest of the 8 settings, I have to jack my car stereo volume almost to the max to hear it and loop the transmitter cable so it hangs in front of the stereo.Monster tried to pass the blame to my car stereo, saying it has a cheap receiver (it's a pretty expensive Bose), but to humor them, I tried it in many cars with different stereos; of course, it works about the same in all of them. Moreover, it plugs into the bottom of the unit, leaving you to operate your iPod upside-down or hold it while driving.Save your money."
4,Travelling with Ipod,"I have used this on an almost daily basis to keep my Ipod charged and have the music/recorded word available to me during my commute as well as on trips. While it's not super easy to initially set up due to the need to find an 'open' station, once I've found one, it holds that station for my personal broadcast. Periodically cumbersome during a long trip that goes through cities that are 'covered up' with radio stations, it is well worth the expense."
4,Works very well and easy to use,"I was very impressed with the ease of use for this product. If you listen to alot of slow music this might not be as impressive as if you listen to fast,hard rock. Noticed a little static and sometimes engine whine in some slower tunes. I'm yet to take it on a trip where I could be changing frequencies alot, so I've kept my cassette adapter just in case it turns out to be alot of hassle. It does great at keeping battery level charged. I highly recommend it after 3 weeks of use."
2,Thanks for breaking. Again.,"This FM transmitter worked fantastic for about two weeks, then, it just decided it wanted to stop. Oh, by all means, it still charges her iPod wonderfully! It's just that the actual transmitter stopped displaying the FM frequency, and it quit broadcasting. Unfortunately, she lost the receipt so we couldn't return it. So now it's basically a $60 car iPod charger. I know personal anecdotes don't usually mean squat, but upon further investigations online, it turns out I'm not alone. Seems these things have a working life of less than a month for a lot of people. Not to mention, they are quite difficult to plug into car outlet. My suggestion? Keep looking and save your money."
1,Does NOT work with Vista - Not Ready for Prime Time,"Love the easy setup, design and looks. Too bad it does not work with Vista. No drivers, no reliable network connection, will not operate under Microsoft Backup that comes with Vista.Good looking piece of junk on my desk. I use it to put my coffee cup on."
2,A review by Bradley Torreano,"""A Tribute to Eminem"" is a collection of songs by the controversial rapper covered by studio musicians. The purpose of the album is to provide an inexpensive way to get all of these songs on one album under the guise of a tribute, which means that these are almost perfect covers with the exception of the vocals, done by a rapper called Un-real . Curious fans of Eminem may want to check this out."
2,OK ALBUM,Well if you want Eminem this is not Em I myself am not a Em fan but the album was pefromed bye a person who had flow but not with these songs he could be a good emcee if he had writen his own songs and put theme on a album but thats not what he was doing this was a tribute album and gets ** stars at best he pefromed some ok songs my fav. being ``im shady`` so do not get the album unless you want a emcee with flow doing songs that he has no flow to
1,COMPLETE GARBAGE,This has to honestly be the worst cd I have ever heard in my life.I bought this cd thinking that the people that were going to be rapping on this cd actually had some skill.Well after about 2 minutes of listining to it I then proceded to snap the cd in half and toss it in the garbage. Trust me that is where it belongs!These guys should be ashamed for ruining eminems music and for just putting out a piece of trash.If like eminem or just like music you can actually listen to for more than a few minutes without shooting yourself in the face skip over this one. PLEASE!!
4,I like the author,I like the author and in this he retells the story of the Teen Tiny Woman. It is a folk story and one that most children enjoy if you read it well.
3,tricky for small dogs,"even though this is the smallest size of the product it looks that is designed for a strong bite dogs. i bought it 4 a schnausser, and the rubber is too strong for her, so she has to lick the hole instead of chew the rubber in order to obtain the food as it is designed originally. is a good product, but doesn't work as expected"
3,55lbs Pit Bull,"My smaller sized Pit Bull had this ""puppy"" torn to shreds by the second day. I love Kong toys, but it was sad and disappointing to see this go as fast as it did.."
5,My Pit loves it!,"I need something that would last the chewing phase of my pitty!! Well, this Kong does the trick!! Great product!"
3,Not made like they used to,"I bought this kong ultra along with the regular kong for our 6 month year old medium size dog and 1 year old medium size dog, and they destroyed them within 2-3 days, with no evidence of them ever existing. Maybe I need to buy the larger size one, but I seem to recall the ones from years ago lasting alot longer. Nonetheless, the dogs enjoyed them."
4,It really lasts!.....,"I've got 2 year pitbull power chewer and he hasn't destroyed this in the least. Only thing he's bee able to do is make puncture holes in it and some scratches after 2 months. The reason I gave it four stars is that it smells bad and I can see some dogs not liking that, although my dog didn't mind it but I would recommend the kong stuff n because when I use that he plays with it longer."
5,Kong- Our dogs love them-Proof is our dog Prince & Ming Toi,Length:: 1:14 MinsOur two dogs love the Kongs. Jeanette stuffs them with peanut butter and they love them and go chewing crazy.Here is our Rottweiler Prince and our Chow Mix Ming Toi enjoying it.They got these on Christmas Day 2010
3,The toy? Meh! The peanuit butter. Ahhhh!,"Our Tess is a 70 pound tooth carrier. She'll chew to pieces anything she can get in her mouth in minutes. But this toy is lasting, simply because she's not that interested in it unless it's full of peanut butter, which she licks up in 5 or 6 minutes. Therefore, not much in play value, at least for her. But 3 stars because otherwise it does pretty much what it's advertised to do. A short piece of garden hose stuffed with a treat might serve as well."
3,It works,Dog likes it if I pack it with treats. otherwise it gets ignored. This thing is pretty damn tuff too. I have two dogs and one of them can destroy most toys quickly but not this thing!
3,Too hard for some dogs so they LEARN to just not bother with it :(,Is your dog a smarty pants? Mine is (50lb pit/lab cross). She's learned the BLACK Kong is just not worth her time and energy! It's just TOO much so she just won't bother with it. I have to put something REALLY good in it to get her going. Think jerky smeared with peanut butter. She won't ever get it out though. Cookie will just get all soggy from slobber so I eventually poke it out with a chopstick for her. Red Kong won't last as long but she'll go at that one with no hesitation....
5,great toy for big dogs,"I have a doberman. He normally can destroy toy in minutes after I buy them. But, he really enjoys his Kong toy especially when I put his doggie treats inside. Keeps him entertain for a bit."
1,Disappointed,My puppy managed to tear a huge chunk out of it in 15 minutes . I was rather disappointed as I have many Kong extremes and they usually last for months. The puppy Kong we have is 4 years old and still good.
2,Ok I guess...,I'm giving this 2 stars only because I haven't seem my dog really interested in this product. I bought this so he can have something to chew. lol So far no luck!
4,Indestructible?,The first toy my dog hasn't destroyed within the first 2 hours. Great product that appears will last a very long time!
2,3 yr lab destroyed this...,My 3 yr old lab enjoyed this but was able to hold in paws and tear pieces off within minutes
2,More durable than other toys but still breaks down,"My 45 lb. lab puppy has already started to break down the rim on the large opening side. She's only had this for two weeks. Granted, she can destroy cheaper toys in one chewing session but I thought this one would last a little longer."
5,Indestructible Toy!,"This is the ONLY toy that has survived regular play by my 95-pound (all muscle) male German Shepherd. There are many toys on the market that purport to be made for heavy chewers and large dogs -- but this toy actually performs as advertised! How refreshing! We have had one of these Extreme, black Kong toys for a few years. It is played with almost daily, and it is still in one piece. On the other hand, I have purchased a couple of the orange ""floating"" Kong on a rope for use in the pool -- oh dear -- those didn't last one day. I loved the toy, but while I was taking photos of my dog running around the pool with the brand new toy, he bit off the top section -- no chewing, just the pressure of his bite. If you have a big, powerful dog, buy the black Kong. It is well worth the money!"
5,The best toy ever,"My lab destroys toys-that's his hobby. But, he can't get throug the Kong. He had it now for about four months-and still-almost like new. I have been stuffing it with his food and peanut butter, adn it keeps him occupied for abotu 30 minutes. Also, it's pretty good throwing toy at flat surfaces like a street. If you bounce it right, it will continue to bounce pretty far away. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!"
1,Lacks practical application,The prose is well written.... BUT that's it. Few insights that can be used in practice for people who aspire to become future leaders.
5,An excellent protection for your phone,"This phone case has impressed me with the protection it has offered to my Nokia 6160 phone. The phone fits snugly into the case. One good thing about this case is, it absorbs the heat generated by the phone. The Nokia 6160 I possess generates a lot of heat if I use it for periods in excess of 45 min at a stretch. So this offers a good protection to your ears!! :) I would recommend buying this if you have a 6160. Its very reasonably priced for its quality and the kind of protection it gives to the phone."
1,Don't waste your money!,We turned it off. There is no Radiohead music. IT is not sanctioned by the band. It is just some horrible video of where they grew up and some pictures of bars they played at! TERRIBLE
4,I wish the remastered original albums sounded this good...,"I saw these guys in '84 for the Mirror Moves tour, and was lucky enough to catch them this time. The sound quality is excellent and does a great job at catching the dynamic of the live show. The only thing missing from this tour were the horns present on the original albums. The new ensemble relies more on guitars, which in itself isn't a bad thing, but it was part of what made the furs so unique back in the day.The new track is beautiful. If this is indicative of what they can do now, I wish they'd release a new album. If you missed the tour, this may be the closest you'll get to seeing them live. Definitely worthwhile."
1,Forget this book,Dont waste your money. Just another hateful Republican who doesnt want to pay taxes but loves war. Forget it.
5,Great Group,"I got this due to a piqued curiosity from listening to samples. Initially, I brushed them off as mediocre, primarily due to the comparison between them and [the] Pet Shop Boys. I love PSB, so I was a bit offended when my friend compared the two. Well, I now highly doubt that he knows them as well as he claims. No, Erasure is not PSB, and PSB is not Erasure; if they were, they would be boring. Erasure has made some excellent material in their own right and their own name; I thoroughly enjoyed this album because it was very unique. I love their songs' subjects; they deal with love a lot more than PSB, and it's all a lot of great music. While this is not the musical-taste defining/changing album that was 'Discography', this has created a further curiosity in Erasure that I will indulge. I look forward to hearing more from Erasure."
1,Do not Buy!,This product was a complete waste of money. The digital display melted the first time I use the thermometer. The oven was set to 350 and within 30 minutes it melted.
1,Failed after less than 2 months,"We used this product a few times a week for about 6 weeks. Then it stopped working altogether. It may just be a battery issue, but after only 6 weeks we shouldn't be having any problems at all."
3,"accuate, but just at the tip",I use this thermometer a lot when making tea. At first I thought it was broken because even when the water was boiling the thermometer only read around 180F. I then noticed that if I only put the tip of thermometer in the water (up to where the thickness of the thermometer increases) I got an accurate reading. Kind of a pain.
4,a little less than expected,This will take at lest 10 secounds to be in the ballpark and thats a long time to hold your hand over the grill. In about 8 secounds as advertised it will be in the ballpark but still going up in temp at ftactions IE 135.3---135.7---136.2---136.8---137 etc. I haven't seen it stop measuring yet! The good news is it is accurate.
1,Known problems never fixed!,"When I recieved the thermometer I played with it a little and I noticed the temperature was off, but I figured I would calibrate it when I go to use it. About two months later I went camping and I followed the instructions to calibrate and the display showed ""LL.L C"" and wouldn't work. I did a google search and I discovered this has been a defect of the thermometer for some time, but they continue to sell them! I will never ever purchase any item made by CDN - Component Design Northwest Inc. Don't waste you time and money looking at this item, you'll be sorry you did!"
4,Does the job!,This is much better than the cheaper models of which I own two. Reading is quick and the hold button makes getting out before your hand burns easy.
5,works like a charm,"I bought this to replace a digital thermometer that didn't work quite right. This one is instant read - very accurate, easy to read and clean. I use it at least 3-4 times/week. I wouldn't cook or grill without it."
1,Worked for less than 15 uses,"I purchased this as a recomended by ""Cooks Illustrated"" best value. It worked great for maybe 15 uses and now it is useless. I tried changing the battery, and it still doesn't work."
1,Junk,Don't waste your money. Thermometer would take forever to reach temperature. A fully cooked pork chop was reading 47.8F degrees. It doesn't take a genius to figure that one out. This one is going back to the post office asap.
2,"Dull, Boring, Just Not Star Wars","this was by far the biggest bust in the whole NJO series. There's barely any action, and without Jacen and Anakin, it's not a good book. Although Elaine Cunningham is developing Jag and Kyp to fill the role of the two lost jedi brothers, the book is just dull with Jaina being taught how to be a lady by the queen mother on hapes and really lacks a strong male presence. Also, Han and Leia are not mentioned enough and the book just stinks! It's pretty obvious that the author is a first time star wars author who should never write another book in her life!!! I only hope the next books are better. Bring back Zahn, Stover and Allston!!"
3,If you like politics then this is the book for you.,"The author, Elaine Cunningham, did a very good job with the characters, scene descriptions, and political points. She did real well with the power struggle involving the queen mother's throne. In order to keep my attention the book needed to be more fast paced with more action."
3,An Unneccesary Interlude,"Although it was interesting to see the character of Jaina explored more thouroughly I found that the novel tended to drag on in places. Also, looking into Jania's mind in her current state of despair was not that interesting. Obviously, to any trained 'Star Wars' reader, Jacen is NOT dead. I also found that Han and Leia seemed much too calm and carefree in this book. It was interesting to go back to the Hapes cluster story line and explore the Solo family's part in it. In the long run; however, this novel did not add much too the overall story line and it almost seemed like an interlude in the series to make it slow down.=Alexis="
3,Just Okay!,"I liked a book about Jaina, merely because female heroes in Star Wars are as always fewer. There were some parts which just didn't work, like for example why would any parents just leave behind their only remaining child. Also Jag Fel needs to be written by someone else, I don't want him to be so sacharrin. But most important for any Star Wars novel - there just wasn't enough action."
3,A bridge to somewhere I hope.......,"I was disappointed with the way this book ended. You have a big build up as the Vong close in on the remaining Solo twin only to have the story end with reformed Kyp. Aside from watching as our heroine slides towards the dark side, there is a tired side story involving palace intrigue and a teaser relationship between Jaina and Jag. Also we are introduced to the son of the Vong Warmaster who is nothing more than a cardboard cutout of a villan. The book felt like a brigde book and I hope that the next story in the NJO is better than this!"
