1,Butchers At It Again,"This is where being a Beatles completist becomes expensive. To spend the price of a full sized CD for 3 cuts not found elsewhere is insane. Capitol is at it again! George Martin's soundtrack work is nice but ... Even with the added space of a CD, there is no added material. This should have been a footnote to another album, say Pepper or the White Album. Yellow Submarine still does not hold up on its own."
3,Not their best,"Yellow Submmarine is unique. You have to remember it is a soundtrack to the movie. They do Yellow Submarine and All You need is love from other albums.They do however come out with four new songs.John contributes Hey Bulldog, which has alot of energy and is probably the best of the rour new tunes.McCartney contributes the very simple but catchy, All together now, which is not up to his usual standard, but not bad.Harrison does Its only a Northern Song which was written when he was fueding with his publishing company. George Harrison at this point in the career of the Beatles, was writing his best music.It's all too much is another Harrison song, but to me is not as favored as Northern Song.The rest is soundtrack music for the film. This is certainly not their best album, but for Beatle addicts like myself it is worth purchasing to complete the collection."
3,The Beatles least listenable record!,This is the only album by the Beatles that I rarely listen to. It's not bad but the orchestra just didn't seem suitable for the record. Ok though make this be the last album to buy.
3,There's An 'ole In Me Pocket,"You try and try and try to not like a song like ""Yellow Submarine,"" and then you catch yourself singing along. Takes all the seriousness out of your oh-so-important adult life, doesn't it?I've always liked this album, and MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR, specifically because of their weirdness. RUBBER SOUL, REVOLVER, and SGT. PEPPER may have hit their targets more precisely, but the Beatles really let themselves go wild on YELLOW SUBMARINE and MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR.The let-down is the George Martin stuff--not a knock at Sir George, but it doesn't do to have six Beatles tunes followed by a block of instrumental soundtrack stuff. Anyone at EMI ever think of adding one more Beatles tune and alternating Beatles/Martin/Beatles/Martin? Might have worked.This LP also boasts two of my favorite Harrison recordings, ""Only A Northern Song"" and ""It's All Too Much."" ""It's All Too Much"" may be the most purely psychedelic recording, lyric, and video of all time, just shimmering with energy."
2,"Rendered obsolete by the newly issued ""Songtrack""","You'd do much better off getting the ""Yellow Submarine Songtrack"". Not only does it feature all the Beatle songs from the movie, but it features the best sound of any Beatles CD by far. Only get this if you're a completist or want George Martin's orchestral score."
4,It's All Tooooo Much!!!!!,"Ok, so you are not going to buy this CD for side two! Nonetheless potential buyers should not neglect the fact that the Beatles' contribution on side one is well worth the purchase. Some heavy tracks have been laid down by George (It's all too much & Only a Northern song) and John (Hey Bulldog). Added to this is the softer tone of previously released material: Yellow Submarine & All You Need Is Love. This album is ""All Too Much""! BUY IT!!!"
4,GO OUT AND GET IT,"IS IT WORTH HAVING? IS THE SUN GOING TO COME UP TOMORROW MORNING? SURE IT'S WORTH HAVING, BUT IT'S NOT THE FIRST BEATLE ALBUM YOU SHOULD BUY. HEY BULLDOG AND IT'S ALL TOO MUCH ARE THE ""NEW STANDOUTS"", AND IT CONTAINS THE TITLE TRACK AND AL YOU NEED IS LOVE FROM YEAR PAST,PLUS SIDE TWO IS NICE. NOT THE BEATLES AT THERE ABSOLUTE BEST, BUT STILL HEADS ABOVE MOST ALL OTHER STUFF OUT THERE, AND OF COURSE ANOTHER MULTI-MILLION SELLER!"
5,remastered,Its All Too Much.Raunchy rock n George roll.The Beatles YS album/cd remastered and sounding better than ever. One of my favorites.........support your favorite artists.
4,Very pretty crystal,"This is a very pretty crystal leaf. I get lots of compliments when I wear it. The only drawback is it's not as colorful in person. It depends on the background, that is, what you're wearing."
3,Just OK,"I was a bit disappointed in this video. There are better instructional videos on YouTube. The couple, especially the woman, was very dry and unmotivating. It does get the basics in, but I think there must be something better out there."
3,The CD is missing the soundtrack!,"If you only want songs by the Beatles, the CD is fine. But if you want the excellent soundtrack to the film, stick with vinyl. I can't imagine why the original was chopped up to become a Beatles album rather than a film soundtrack, but it was a big mistake. I did find a Japanese CD of the soundtrack - it might have been a bootleg edition - which was fine, but basically I've kept my vinyl copy because the blending of Beatles tunes with other compositions for the movie is so much more enjoyable."
4,Tell me what you see,"""Help!"" is their best since ""With the Beatles."" Like ""A Hard Day's Night,"" it's pointed; also like that album, it's a little too thin. But this is more exciting than ""A Hard Day's Night,"" thanks to a couple good Harrison compositions, ""Ticket to Ride,"" and the most covered song in history, ""Yesterday,"" which is the best of these fourteen tracks. And then there's ""Dizzy Miss Lizzy,"" an explosive finish which promises great things to come. It's even better now that we know they kept their promise."
4,Good Soundtrack,"This album is a good collection from the film and various singles. Although not as brilliant as what is to come, Help still holds it own. The last album before the Beatles become heavily influnced by the various things that would affect them, Help is goo and the second best of the earily albums. Yesterday is, of course, one of the great classics."
2,FINAL ANALYSIS V/Help,"""tired (2)""still , no artistical advance since ""AHDN"". A few great tracks (Help,you've got to hide your love away,ticket to ride) , but lots of inessential , crappy filler. **"
1,Redundant Gassbag,"Bought this as a supplement for actors in a play I'm helping to produce. This guy may have been a pioneer in his time, but he can't write. Completely redundant, awful, repetitive, crap. You can learn more about method acting in a wiki article."
1,album is terrible,I love Pink Floyd. I enjoyed everthing from Meddle to the Divison Bell. But i would have to say that this is the worst album i have ever heard. I listened to it once and then never touched it since. It is terrible. Everybody here gives it 4 stars so it looks like it is good. Is everybody scared to say something bad about pink floyd. Honestly this album is ridiculous.
2,An Unexpected Let Down From a Good Group Like Floyd,"I tried to keep and open mind when listening but it was difficult since this album played with it like a ping-pong ball!! No offense to anyone who might enjoy it but it just doesn't measure up to Floyd's previous psychadelic works like PIPER AT THE GATES OF DAWN and A SAUCERFUL OF SECRETS. Even David Gilmour himself described UMMAGUMMA as an experiment and he's right. Despite the poor studio album, the live album is OK. It adds to already goos works like ASTROMOMY DOMINE although there are only four songs on it."
5,PF's most underrated...,"This is sadly Pink Floyd's most underrated albums, which I think in many ways, is their best. Of course it's a transition record, but it's too bad they never got this exprimental on later albums. You reviewers that write this off as trash can take your place back on the farm with the other sheep. Your brain doesn't have the capacity for this kind of genius. If you still don't get it, then try a bit of ""psychedelic"" tea to help convince you..."
4,OOOOPS!,"I meant to say, the live version of Saucerful of Secrets. I am so embarrased! Echoes is on MEDDLE (so many reviews for Amazon.com I get confused!!!). Anyway, Saucerful of Secrets is a great song and worth the purchase of the 2 CD set. The other live versions are grat too and should not be missed."
5,Ummagumma - the underrated sound experience,I've always enjoyed the soundscape aspect of Pink Floyd. This CD set has a shining example of live Floyd with the peak songs of the psychadelic soundscape early floyd era. The second studio disc has loads of creative potential and a few jems with lyrics. the majestic powerful sounds of Sysyphus; the sweet airy sounds of Grantchester Meadows (a PF favorite of mine); the Narrow way is full of curiousity; the Grand Vizer's Garden is pure clean syncopated noises
2,Most Bizarre Album Of Pink Floyd's!,"Now this is the ONE Pink Floyd album I have a real hard time getting into. Not surprisingly, it's one of the bands most unpopular albums, with most fans not knowing what to make of it. While the ""Live"" half features GREAT live performances of 3 classics from their first 2 albums and one really interesting b-side, ""Careful With That Axe, Eugene"", the ""Studio"" half is extremely bizarre and is barely listenable at best. It contains instrumental pieces from Waters, Gilmour, Wright, and Mason. Some Lyrical content, but not much. Mostly a lot of really wierd noise making that makes me wonder if it's really even music. I think the band's goal here was to make the most bizarre record possible, to be ""out-wierded"" by nobody else. Well, in my opinion, I think they reached their goal with this one."
3,What's with the studio cut??,"I only give this album 3 stars because of how good the live music is. But what's with the studio cut? Why would i pay over 20 dollars for a double cd in which one entire cd is the sounds of the wind blowing through the trees, jumbled piano playing, and random animal noises. I don't know what they were on when they recorded this album, but I want some."
3,The last word in sonics for Ummagumma?,"I'm a big Pink Floyd fan. I also happen to really like Ummagumma. Especially the live album. Which I believe are the definitive versions of all four songs. Ummagumma was in desperate need of a remaster though as the sonics were fair if I'm being kind. I had very high expectations for the remaster. I had heard the improvements that the 2011 remasters did to DSotM, Meddle, Animals, and The Wall. I was hoping for similar sonic bliss.I have to say that I was a bit disappointed. The noise floor is still much higher than what I would like. I understand that maybe the master tapes themselves could be in poor shape but that still doesn't dampen my enthusiasm.If you've never heard Ummagumma before I think this is the version you need to pick up. If you already have Ummagumma on the previous CD then, however, I might hold off. It's a 4 star album that I'm giving 3 stars for the remaster not meeting my (possibly lofty) expectations."
2,Two CD's of boring sound effects,"This album is most valuable as a museum piece: It's part of the bridge from the psychedelic Pink Floyd of Syd Barrett to the Pink Floyd of Waters/Gilmour: one of the greatest hard rock bands of all time.But otherwise, I don't see the appeal of this album. It's mostly boring sound effects. Just because a song is long and incomprehensible, that does not make it either deep or good.You really have to be Pink Floyd-obsessed to like this album. While I definitely consider myself a Pink Floyd fan, I am not a fan of ""Ummagumma""."
5,Wonderful without wall space,"We have a lot of nice knives but little wall clearance in our kitchen. I can speak to quality and simplicity and functionality of this -- I love that it holds both long and short knives. It fits perfectly in one of the small silverware-sized drawers, with some room to spare for a few of our crappier knives that we stuff alongside! The wood seems sturdy, and there were no blemishes or inconsistencies (that I could tell) on the product."
5,Incredibly Useful Item!,"This fits beautifully in the drawer, holds all my knives and allows each to be safely accessed. Great product at a good price."
5,A cut above,Perfect for our needs. It keeps our knives neatly in a shallow drawer. Probably will buy another for another location.
4,Great organizing tool,"I ordered and received this knife tray promptly. It fits in the drawer perfectly and holds the knives well. I ordered it for some Cutco knives I bought from a neighbor girl. The Cutco was ordered before this knife tray. I have the knife tray now but still no knives so hats off for fast shipping on the knife tray. The knife tray is much better than having a jumble of knives in a tray in the drawer. Agree with the other reviewer about the knives sitting on rubber coated metal bars. Not great, but I still love the knife tray and if my knives go through the rubber, I'll just get a new knife tray. For $29.95, I'm ok with replacing it every few years."
4,Night Falls Fast: Understanding Suicide,The book was in good condition but it took longer to arrive than other Amazon books I've order
5,Night Falls Fast: Understanding Suicide,"This is a very well written book by a psychiatrist who has faced the issue of suicide in both her personal and professional life. It is well researched and supported by her experience in dealing with patients in her practice. She provides a good literature review and makes a strong case for major depressive and bipolar disorders as factors in the etiology of many suicides. This book provides a good general introduction to suicide for both the lay and professional reader. The very troubling issue of why some commit suicide without any warning is addressed. Risk factors such as age, gender and alcohol and drug use are reviewed. The author discusses the differences in suicide patterns in males and females who attempt or complete suicides as well as age difference in suicide victims.James J. Garber M.D., PhD."
2,Not worth the money and Buzz and Woody figures don't fit,"I got horrible service from Amazon and Pinkwater, then the toy was not worth the price they were charging. The Buzz and Woody figures don't even fit in it. Maybe they'll get it right with Toy Story 2 releases, but I wouldn't buy it from Amazon or Pinkwater."
2,Where's the Buzz?,My wife bought this for our 3.5 year old for Christmas to complement the large 12 inch Buzz action figure. She assumed Buzz would fit into this space ship.....wrong! This thing's a lot smaller and seems to be made for much smaller versions of Buzz action figures which I have yet to actually find......and we already bought the larger Buzz. <sigh> Seems the product planning for the Buzz Line wasn't too well thought out.
2,Waste of Time and Money,"This book purports to teach someone how to use JBuilder, as well as java. It doe neither. Examples don't work and should be proofread. If you start working with the practical exercises and mess up, forget it. Not user friendly at all. Needs more specific examples, with detailed discussion on what is happening."
1,(learn in 14 day version) AWFUL!,"NOTE: This applies to the ""Borland teach yourself JBuilding in 14 [not 21] days"" by the same author.It is the $40 learn Java in 14 days kit with Jbuilder 1.1After learning the basics of Basic, Visual Basic, Pascal, C, SQL, HTML, I figured I'd spend my last summer of college learning to program Java. Lets put it this way, I've gotten to page 300 (out of 500) and I've learned about a couple pages worth of information.This book ""explains"" the entire Java language in days 3-5, but explains it in a very technical and very difficult to understand way. And I've had a lot of programming experience.I may just have to buy another Java book and hope that after ANOTHER couple of weeks maybe I'll learn a little Java!"
4,Preschool play costume,The costume was used for my 4 year old son who had the role of a knight in the school play. The costume was great. The costume was used without the red wrap because the teacher wanted white and gold. I only had to have it altered to a tunic for a toddler boy. I was pleased with my purchase.
5,Better than NiCd batteries ...,The Energizer ER-P511 Nickel-Metal Hydride Cordless Phone Battery is way better than the NiCd battery that comes with the phone. I had nothing but battery trouble from the day I purchased my phone. The new battery has fixed all my battery problems and is working great!
4,Er-P511 battery much better than Panasonic P-511Y,"Very pleased that I learned of the availability of the Er-P511 as a replacement for the Panasonic P-511Y cordless phone battery. I was about ready to dispose of the Panasonic phone because of the poor reliability and life of the Panasonic batteries. Fortunately, the phone is functioning like new again with the Er-P511 replacement battery and I'm looking forward to a lot more life from the phone. I recommend this Energizer battery."
3,Was NOT the Energizer brand!,"I was upset that it was NOT the Energizer brand as advertised, but since I needed the battery, I decided to give it a chance and so far it works just fine. I just hope it lasts as long as the Energizer. Perhaps it will last longer. But still, I should have gotten the brand that was advertised. I could have gotten other brands for less money."
4,"There is better, but...","The technical artistry of this CD is poor and the consumer is better advised to get the original versions of these songs on the original albums, especially WUTHERING HEIGHTS. Yet, this CD was my introduction to Kate Bush and I fell in love with her brilliance and originality. Particularly moving for me is CLOUDBUSTING, a song based on Wilhelm Reich sung from the perspective of his son...incredible stuff. If you have never heard Kate Bush please get one of her albums, especially HOUNDS OF LOVE. You'll fall in love with her too..."
5,Slow Paced - Non-typical Bette Davis Film,Bette Davis plays the role of an invilid. Her part in the film is very short and at the end. I do not recommend for those primarily interested in seeing Bette Davis in a leading role.
3,Not bad as far as it goes....,"Got this on a recommendation from a fellow at a blog I visit from time to time. Being over 70 young years of age, I've seen quite a few of the old black and whites as I grew up.I think the acting is good and the overall story / plot line likewise. A morality tale like most of life."
2,Some problems,"This bulb is sort of too big at the base to fit into my torchiere without taking the whole torchiere shade off. Also, it occasionally flickers. The 3 way feature does work though, but it may not be bright enough for some people. I hope to buy a better 3 way some other time."
2,50% failure rate,"I purchased two of them, and have experienced the same problems as other reviewers - the base is too wide to fix into existing 3-way fixtures that accept std. 3-way bulbs in many cases (check your lamp before purchasing; if there is not plenty of clearance, don't purchase), and second, and more important, one of the bulbs lasted only a week (a 50% failure rate). The filament would glow, but not light, the bulb; then finally the filament would not glow either.The bulbs are WAY too expensive for such short life, but too inexpensive to really justify sending back for warranty (esp. if I have to cover postage) - keep your receipt and be ready for warranty problems. Because of the wide base (who designed this thing? Won't fit in a std 3-way lamp), and the hit or miss product reliability and quality, I'd recommend trying another manufacturer first (not Sylvania). I don't have problems with Sylvania's other products."
1,WASTE OF MONEY,"Bulb lasted less than 2 weeks before not coming on at all! At the price, it's OUTRAGEOUS and now, I have to ""properly"" dispose of it since it has mercury!I will never buy another SYLVANIA CFL BULB!"
2,Very short life,"Like most of my experience so far with florescent lamp bulbs, the life span is too short to make up the extra cost compared to an incandescent bulb. This one lasted a few months, but but more importantly, I received a small fraction of its' advertised hours of life (6000) -- I got about 400 before it died. I read somewhere that you get better life out of fluorescent lamp bulbs if they are not cycled frequently, and let run longer (e.g. not good for a quick bathroom break), but this particular lamp was cycle maybe 2 times per day, and usually left on for 1 hour minumum.I'll continue to buy these types of bulbs, mainly for the reduced heat, but I won't be buying this one again."
2,but only in mono!,"Im not drunk, I'm beware that this one is not stereo but mono recording! the beatles reached their popularity in 1964 because of the commercial success they covered the american rock n roll bands in the periode. But this album is a bit tame! many die hard fans are not beware of this.The Beatles was not alone in the music scene but Led Zeppelin & deep purple are definitively much better."
2,what?,"I just can't imagine why the company released this in HIFI Monophonic???? The first early Beatle CD's are all in that format. What a waste. At least they could have released the CD in real monophonic (mono). Songs like ""And I love Her"" without the overdub would sound much better in the original mono like the United Artist version of this album. Also ""If I fell"" without Paul's voice break in the last verse would sound much better. All in all a stereo version of this cd would be satisfying, not this junk."
5,GREAT!,The CD was in excellent condition like advertised and I received it quickly without any hiccups.
2,classic but the whole songs are very easy!,"my god! I dont understand the people who loved this early Beatles album,...the songs sounded almost the same one to another,..VERY POP! very 60's and oh! what can I say? only for the young tennie girls in the 60's....very easy songs,...happy shit"
5,"Re-mastered =Re""fabbed""","This should be the final rest for the Beatles CD Catalogue (unless of course they come out in a halogram version and 3D in the future, ha! ha! ha!) But thisCD has a warmer sound like the album and what can you say about these songs?...sweeeeeeeeeeeeet!!! 3 thumbs up!...get it! buy it!...love it!"
5,Excellent album now in stereo.,"This album features songs from their first motion picture. It's also the first to utilize four-track technology and the first in which every song was credited to Lennon-McCartney (John writing 10 of the tracks, Paul with 3). The hits off this album are ""Can't Buy Me Love"", the title track and the single ""And I Love Her"" released in the US. Of all the tracks, only ""I Should Have Known Better"" appears in stereo for the first time.The Fab Four were still fundamentally a rock group at this point showing traces of their roots.`This is arguably their third best album of the Beatlemania era only behind ""Rubber Soul"" and ""Revolver"". A truly essential album."
5,The Beatles at their early best!,"The opening chord of track 1 warns us that something special is about to happen---and it does! ""A Hard Day's Night"" contains some of The Beatles greatest early rockers like ""Can't Buy Me Love"", ""Tell Me Why"",""I Should Have Known Better"" and the title track. At the same time it also features two of their most beautiful ballads, ""If I Fell"" and Paul McCartney's first step up to mature song writing, ""And I Love Her."" In fact, there's not a bad song on here from start to finish. As for the sound comparison to the previous release(released in mono only)--there simply isn't any. The remastered stereo version is bright, clean and sharp. The vocals, guitars and drums are all stunning and there's a freshness present that makes you feel like you're hearing these classic songs for the first time. Listening to this 1964 recording, it's easy to see why Beatlemania was sweeping the world. An absolute must for Beatle fans or any lovers of 1960's pop rock."
1,langweillig!,this was the boys who covered the american rhythm and blues in the 60's? they admired elvis and wanted to be him.
5,The best Pink Floyd album ever.,"Like a lot of bands, the original lineup was always the best. I really miss Syd Barrett. He had his own style of playing, and really made some great tunes with Pink Floyd. This is by far the best Floyd album there is. Psychadelic children's music is the best way to describe it. The best songs are Astronomy Domine, Interstellar Overdrive, and Bike. What I like about this album is that all the ambiences are done by the band. There are no ridicoulous soundbytes like in later albums, and of course, the guitar playing is incredible. Syd Barrett is a really underrated guitar player. He isn't afraid to use dissonance and make his guitar sound otherworldy. Plus, there's some really great riffs that are almost metal. The best Floyd album, before they went butt rock with Dark Side Of The Moon. GET IT NOW!"
3,Pink Floyd's most overrated album?,"Piper was Pink Floyd's debut album and it really shows. There is a very simplistic, almost amateurish quality to the songs, Astronomy Domine being the only exception. About half the songs on this album are very simple and aimed at a younger audience, and by younger I mean ages 3 to 8! Unicorns, gnomes, ""oh mother, tell me more""...it was all just a bit too hokey and childish to me. The biggest disappointment on this album was Interstellar Overdrive. What should have been a cool, psychedelic track in the same vein of Astronomy Domine, ended up dissolving into a chaotic noisy wreck. In finality, I will say that this album is still a decent listen, and if fairytale-ish tunes are your cup of tea then you will be thoroughly satisfied. This was just ok for me, not something I will listen to often.6/10"
4,THE BIRTH OF PINK FLOYD!!,"Although drastically different from Floyd's later works, this album is still pretty incredible. An asset for any Pink Floyd fan, and for fans of Syd Barrett."
5,Hey!,"Hey! I like Radiohead! They sound like 70s Floyd, which is a good thing. They're one of the best bands around today, underground or otherwise.Oh by the way, Piper At The Gates of Dawn rules! Listen to it! Sing along with it! Love it!"
4,No See Emily Play? What dope producer screwed up?,"""Flaming"" is a nice addition. Actually almost anything from that era would have been a nice addition however, what idiot decided to get rid of ""See Emily Play"" the quintessential song on the original album? I deducted a star for that. There's plenty of room for it. How insensitive can you get. Having aired my gripe this is a great album. Sid's music stands up nicely even though the recording is a bit raw compared to today's tech. Really groundbreaking. Better than almost any other over ground music from that era or culture or whatever you want to call it. Really captures the essence of the aesthetic. A way under rated disk."
4,Did you really listen to Interstellar Overdrive?,"in the middle part, the guitar (using a vocoder or bag or some kind of effect like that) 'says ', in a gasping tone, ""you're choking me"". The end of the song ends with an odd drum cadence with off time rimshots: running footsteps and gunshots."
4,Pretty Good,"Piper, in my opion, is not as good as Pink Floyd's later cd's but it gets four stars just for being a Pink Floyd album. Plus I was born in '86 so I don't enjoy music from the sixties very much."
2,"Nothing like Waters-era Floyd, ""Piper"" is poorly-aged psychedelia","What else can I add to the title? Don't buy this expecting a taste of Floyd's later visionary works. Piper strangely reminds me of The Kinks' ""Village Green Preservation Society,"" another album that probably sounded fine in its time, but now leaves kitsch dripping from your speakers. Some of the songs wouldn't sound out of place on a late 60's parody record. (See: ""The Gnome.)For clarity's sake, I think we should stop referring to Pink Floyd as a single band, and instead refer to them as Synk Flarrett, & Royd Pinkers. (Post-waters Floyd doesn't need a name, because we don't ever need to talk about it.)"
5,Personally I think this is Pink Floyds best CD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I truely love Pink Floyd and for being only 15 take great pride in saying that I own many of the bands greatest works, Piper at the Gates of Dawn, Saucerfull of Secrets, The Wall, DARKSIDE OF THE MOON( hint hint thats my favorite)"
2,Confused plot lines do not a good story make,"I've read all four of the new Necromunda books that have come out and this has to be the worst of the four. While I appreciate the point of having multiple plot lines running all at once to play off of one another, it's clumsily done in this book. The larger purpose of why the curator goes into the Underhive doesn't appear until the very end -- and is absolutely at odds with why HE thinks he's going...which smacks of the author not being able to wrap things up neatly. I can appreciate plots that come to a halt abruptly - this is best done in the Mad Donna book 'survival instinct' - but spending all those pages on subplots that are little more than atmospherics detracts from the main storyline. The book is not served by lengthy descriptions of life as an Escher or Goliath ganger...these just muddy the waters. Read this book only if you can buy it used and are hellbent on reading them all."
5,Wonderful book no matter what age you are!,"This is a great book about Abraham Lincoln no matter what age you are! Perfect for young children to bring him to life! This book tells unique facts about him with historical accuracy, and amazing illustrations. I highly recommend this book to introduce President Lincoln, or add to your collection!"
3,Poor design,"With the wind deflector in place 4 inches is the largest pan/pot that will fit on the burner. The fuel attachment is easier to use than earlier models. The grill and the griddle work okay. When we have space in the Jeep, we take the full size Coleman stove and the full size grill - leave the Grill Stove at home."
5,Used it again for 3 days during power outage @ Hurricaine Sandy,"We used this Colman Camping stove about 3 years ago during a 2-day camping trip. We employed 1 Coleman propane gas fuel cylinder. Unexpectedly, it turned out to be a ""life saver"" at our residence home. We used this stove, with the same gas cylinder to boil water for breakfast coffee, and to heat our lunch\dinner meals, for 3 days.The Grill side was used to toast bread slices and bagels.This unexpected usage was imposed on us by the power outage through hurricane Sandy (in NJ). This product paid for itself completely, and highly recommend it!"
5,SImple stunning fragrance,Have received lots of compliments on the fragrance. Very subtle and sweet with a tinge of woodsy. Will buy again.
2,Damaged upon delivery,Packaging was fine. No visible damage. I opened the box to make sure the item was OK. The screws to the pop-up tray were floating around the box and the tray itself was cocked to one side. 2 Stars only because Amazon customer service is great!!
4,Good guide for those looking for inspiring ideas...,"....but I was a tad disappointed with the slight bias towards forms with lids and handles. Despite this, the book is a great guide for beginner and intermediate level pottery enthusiasts (using either hand throwing and coiling methods)as it contains a lot of ideas to make your next project! A good book to have if you are just starting out and want to break away from the traditional shapes of bowls and pots."
3,Who killed The Sex Pistols?,"This is the soundtrack to the""documentary""about The Sex Pistols. It features a few good tracks and a lot of junk. The songs sung by Sid Vicious are a definite highlight, especially the legendary ""My Way"". The tracks by original vocalist Johnny Rotten are poorly perfomed, unrehearsed covers of other people's songs, other than the reprise of ""Anarchy in the U.K."" fromNever Mind the Bollocks. There are also a few vocal contributions by Sex Pistols Steve Jones and Paul Cook, which are pretty good. And then there are the odds and ends. There are mediocre contributions by Ten Pole Tudor, bank robber Ronnie Biggs and Sex Pistols svengali Malcom McLaren. Then there is the really weird stuff; a disco Sex Pistols medley and a traditional French version of Anarchy in the U.K. This CD is for hard core Sex Pistols fans only."
2,Believe Malcolm,"When he says the Sex Pistols were a rock n roll swindle, you may as well believe him. Certainly, this album is a swindle, and its sales must make Malcolm (their manager) laugh all the way to the bank. A few unreleased Sex Pistols songs, a few weak tunes by other members, and some Malcom produced crap make this a forgettable CD. Sure there are some funny songs here. So what? There are lots of funny songs around. These aren't particularly witty by any means. Seriously, the Sex Pistols were a good band, then and now, highly overrated. Pick up their first CD and that's all you need. Or better yet, by something by the Clash, Ramones, Buzzcocks, Dead Kennedys, or The Damned. Hear real punk music that wasn't ""Svengalied"" into existence. So, okay, you can yell at me now. :)"
3,Get the joke or get on with it...,"I can't say this is an unmitigated punk classic. I CAN, however, claim to love several funny/brilliant tracks that are far more chaotic (and thereby closer to the spirit of punk) than any of the other Sex Pistols residual recordings. ""A Punk Prayer"" with Ronnie Biggs is a lot more fun than an entire Damned Box Set, ""C'mon Everybody"" has Sidney going at it with a spot-on Joey Ramone impression, ""Belsen Was a Gas"" tore us all up back in grade nine (no accounting for taste), and for good measure they've included Sid's ""My Way,"" a shambolic masterpiece of style over substance.My only complaint comes from the symphonic bits, and the lack of inclusion of ""No Fun"", one of the more brilliant Pistols covers, only found on other import junk like ""Flogging a Dead Horse.""Buy it especially for these odds 'n' sods, particularly the title track. Lots of fun for the whole family."
4,A different view of history,This is an excellent book which gives a different viewpoint than most of the books written about this time in the world's not-too-distant past. Reading about the life-long friendships that were formed during that horrendous time was heartwarming. The years of planning and research that went into the writing are truly evident and the result is something that can be handed down to future generations. The children of all these people must truly be proud of their parents.
2,Disappointed,"I love Suzanne Brockmann's characters and plots. This book promised to be more of what I love. Only it was, and it wasn't.She included some of her usual interesting characters and plots, but the book had an agenda that I found very disappointing. I should have realized when I read her opening pages describing her son and his recognition that he felt he was a homosexual. Because of Brockmann's desire to legitimize homosexuality she has incorporated in this story several men who are homosexuals or are struggling with that issue in their lives. This is at times a bit unbelievable, but my main concern is that it overpowers the story. I thought I was buying a romance. Instead this is a not-so-subtle argument for acceptance of homosexuality and those who struggle with this issue. That is not what was advertised."
3,Alright,This book wasn't too bad. The last action scene was a little confusing at the end. I recommended it to my friends and I can't wait to get their feedback.
5,Kyocera Ceramic Fine Mill,This is exactly what I've been looking for. The pepper comes out perfectly! I bought the white top mill as well for our sea salt. You won't be disappointed. Love it!!
5,Reliable,"We have several of these pepper mills (various family members, different locations) and they are unfailingly reliable. We like ""fine"" rather than ""adjustable"" because the adjustable often become unadjustable. This is a good size grind for general cooking. And the price is great."
1,Does not grind wet salt well.,"I read all the reviews about how this grinder will grind wet sea salt. In my experience it barely grinds Celtic sea salt. The ground salt varies from tiny pieces to large globs of salt, somewhat like varying snow flakes.For Celtic salt you might want to use a mortar and pestle, or use it in cooking."
1,Doesn't Grind Flax Seeds,"I bought this to grind whole flax seeds. This should have done the trick, but it's obviously not durable, or made well enough to do this. Returning it today - sad, I wish it had worked!"
4,Grinder,Great little grinder. Glad I purchased. I would recommend to anyone looking for a grinder for sea salt. Works like a champ every time.
1,Skagen watch crystal veeeery fragile,"Tried to replace battery on skagen titanium watch, pressed real hard on back to snap cover back on and crystal just shattered. Not pleased."
5,An honest portrayal of the effects of war upon one B17 pilot,I have read this book numerous times since I first purchased it ten years ago. The emotion of the author is felt each time I read it. A very honest and realistic portrayal. My favorite book on the subject You will not be disappointed.
3,Obscured By Moons,"One of Floyd's lesser inspired albums, Obscured cannot be faulted too much due to the soundtrack nature, although it will always be difficult to stomach some of their poppier stale songs on this one. This is pretty much their dullest early recording (yet to hear another earlier soundtrack ""More"" though) although unlike the later much bemoaned post-Waters era stuff, the songs that aren't straightforward ho-hum rock can truly begin to formulate some of the electronically melodic induced beauty that was to shortly engulf this and much of their other material with next year's Dark sided triumph."
5,The most under rated Floyd of all,"I really don't have any better things to add then the great reviews prior. I was really happy when CD's came along because my record copy was doing the snap, crackle, pop, that happens after age and a lot of use. If you haven't heard this one and are a Floyd fan, then do yourself a huge favor and add it to your collection."
4,Good Music but...,not quite the pink floyd we know and love. i think that the songs on here are two short there all just three minutes long which is not pink floyd in least in some cases. and the type of music on here just isnt so much them but still is pretty goodthe album before dark side of the moonpretty good for any big floyd fan
4,Best Floyd Filmsoundtrack,"This soundtrack has a very mellow flow to it. I think people underrate too much. Yes, it's not WISH YOU WERE HERE, DSOTM, or THE WALL, but it is still good. You can't compare floyds works to those albums and judge it that way. Most of their other albums would get a one. It is still an amazing soundtrack. A few of my fav songs on this cd are, OBSCURED BY CLOUDS (awesome instrumental), Wots...UH THE DEAL (nice soft lyrical song very nice), STAY (I think right now my fav song on the album that could change though) If you are a true fan of floyd and arn't one of those punks that only likes them for DSOTM, you may find this album a nice compilation to your collection."
3,Not what you'd expect,"If you're looking for that deep rich fat sound you heard in ""Let it Be"" (Naked) or ""The Beatles LOVE"" you won't find it here. Sure the sound is cleaner and the packaging is nice but that's it. I saw Paul McCartney on ""Entertainment Tonight"" he said that the sound is so great it sounded as if the person singing was right next to you. Nothing was remixed or anything done to bring these recording to today's standards they just took the original mixes and used some software to clean them up don't believe the hype it doesn't even compare to the original albums. My advise skip the CDs unless you just don't own the original ones."
4,In Dire Need of A Remaster,"This is not the Beatles most inspired album, but it has plenty of charm and character that has been lost in its translation to compact disc.Please, Apple, EMI and all surviving ex-Beatles, remaster the first 4 CDs of the British Beatles Catalog. I have mono vinyl pressings that sound richer and warmer than the the first four Beatles compact discs. Please give the Beatle musical catalog the respect that it deserves."
3,Some Good Stuff....,"But I only really like the first 6 songs, with ""I'm A Loser"" being my fav. I love The Beatles, but out of all their CD's this one is the one collecting the most dust on my shelf."
3,Good,"Three songs on this album makes it desireable, but it is the Beatles. The covers are getting a little old and is a step backwords after writing all their stuff on A Hard Day's Night. A massive step backward from the previous, but fairly stright forward for an early Beatles album -- Good and not Great"
5,UNDERRATED GEM,I think Beatles For Sale is a great album. Every Beatles album is different from the others. The playing is great and covers like Kansas City and Rock & Roll Music show they could rock.
4,FOR SALE IN THE 60's - STILL SELLING IN THE 90's!,"It is perhaps difficult to remember back some thirty five years (Yes! 35 years) to when 'BEATLES FOR SALE' first hit the shelves, but for me, this album has been legendary! It is not all Beatles original work, and may have been put together in a rush to beat Christmas, but it showed their early versatility between numbers such as 'No Reply' and, say, 'Rock And Roll Music'. Of interest, Ringo was at this time rated about the best drummer (with Ginger Baker) in the world, and some of his efforts here would tend to support that. Their rendition of 'Words Of Love' would do Buddy Holly proud, as would, with the exception of 'Mr Moonlight', their other cover versions on this album. Given the era - 'Beatles For Sale' remains, for me, one of my more treasured classics!"
4,Hits on the highlights,"Without going into deep details, you get a good birds-eye view of different religions. It is easy to read and understand."
2,Old Information,Rented this dvd while I thought I was going to get a tutorial on how to create a killer PowerPoint Presentation but what he gives is basic information you could have gotten off of YouTube for FREE!
4,"Kind of Cheesy, but a good basic overview",Great explanations on a couple of simple steps. Easy to follow. Only helpful for someone very new to ballroom dancing.
3,"Fairly ok, but definitely not 5 stars","The book is supposed to be an introduction to 3D programming and therefore meant for beginners. lthough it shows how some things are done,it does not give explanations on why things are done, which is necessary for a beginner to do implement things on his/her own . Although there are examples, it does not include a simple game for example showing how the knowledge he impacts is put together in creating a game, which will help a beginner the more. Intermediate/advanced users wil definitely find it useless. Most of the examples are in the SDK- and are very simple ones. I didn't feel I was been taught at all, and had to return the book. Also the book is very small, like a paperback novel.I advise you browse it in a bookshop before buying it.You will learn a lot more from Lamothe's book Regarding voting buttons, I did not see any option for it while writing the review."
5,An excellent Gunsmith western and mystery!,"Clint Adams helps his friend, Chief Inspector from Scotland Yard, by watching over one of his detectives, when he comes to New York to hunt for a killer. Adams has his hands full in this one. The author did a great job of showing how New York was at that time period. Great atmosphere and spooky, as Adams helps find the killer. An excellent Gunsmith western, but also an exciting mystery."
3,Decent Trance but not enough vocals,"Though some people like non-vocal trance, which I do sometimes, I lean more towards the vocal side of Trance.There is a pattern to these three discs. Throw a couple vocal tracks at the beginning to get you excited (Disc 2 ""Sacrifice"" is the best song of the bunch) and then reduce it to monotonous beats one after another. Most of the tracks, after the vocal ones, blend into each where you can't tell one from the other. I admit there are great intrumental trance anthems (Paul Van Dyk, BT, Ferry Corsten, William Orbit have had some killer tunes) but these were middle of the road trance.The only great thing about it is you get alot of songs for the money."
5,Invaluable for the Novice or Experienced REXX Programmer,I have been muddying my way through REXX for many years. I only recently discovered this book and would give anything to have discovered it 20 years ago. Thanks Gabe.
3,Average,"This review concerns the original 1945 edition. Frank and Joe help their father capture a group of thieves that steal valuable radio equipment and communicate in code using short-wave radio. Also, an old friend of Mr. Hardys asks for the detective's help in locating some missing friends. This was the first book in which Chet had a hobby (in this case, taxidermy) that played a part in the mystery. Not much to say about this book, actually, it's neither good nor bad, just average. The mystery is not spectacular and it's not boring either. Most Hardy Boys fans would probably not be very excited by this book, but it probably won't put them to sleep either."
1,Less than 1 STAR !,My list of objections:1. This phone is NOT extra loud. It is extra quiet.2. This phone's volume control at its highest is less loud than an ordinary phone.3. The owner's manual author has poor command of the English.4. The owner's manual instructions have several errors.5. I'm sending it back ASAP.6. The actual rating I'd like to give is MINUS 5 stars!
4,Nice product for the price.,"The look and size of the stereo is just what I wanted. I purchased to be used in my boys room, age 6 and 4, and for them it is adequate. The speakers are a little ""fuzzy"" at the higher range, but it is easy to use and they really like it."
3,Reviewing old purchases,"I loved this CD when it first came out; however, listening to it again, I find that it doesn't seem to withstand the test of time."
5,"Run and hide now, we fight soon","I read The White Mountains in the sixth grade, after already reading the City of Gold and Lead and The Pool of Fire. I became acquainted with the series while reading the comic strip adaption in Boys Life magazine in the late eighties.This is an outstanding series, intended for young readers but it will still entertain the older readers as well.Young Will Parker leaves his English village with his cousin Henry and flee to the White Mountains. They seek to escape the Tripods, giant machines who control the human race through mind controlling Caps. In France, they hook up with Beanpole, a French boy.This is an excellent story about resisting tyranny, and filled with great adventure and an easy plot to follow. Young readers will love it."
4,Good Book,"I really liked the story, although i am 24 i still found myself as immersed in it as i was when i read it in 7th grade."
3,Memory Lane,"Read this when I was a kid, late '60s/early 70's. Not as great as memory had it, but I think I mostly remember the other two books in the series, when they're in the alien's compound."
4,Great Series,This is a great series for kids of all ages. We are reading it to our 6 year old who is inthrolled and cannot wait for the next night and the next chapter! My mother in law read it to my husband and he is thrilled to be reading it to his child!
5,"Up there with the Hobbit, It is THAT good. Read it NOW!!","At first, It was a book we were reading in class. I am the person that always reads 4 or 5 chapters ahead. I started reading, I first, I was confused, then I was curious, then it was exciting, then it was confusing, then it went back to beung exciting. Basically, A book that the class read in about 3-4 months, I read in one weekend. I was glad that I had found such a good book, but sad that it was already over... but, when I looked at the cover, I saw the ""part of the tripod trillogy"" , then almost instentaniously picked up ""The city of gold and lead"" , which I have had for 3 days and am on page 187. Bottom line, go to the library and borrow it, or buy it. It's worth it."
4,A book with fast action and one exiting twist after another,"This Sci-fi adventure book packed with fast paced action with a theme of determination had to be written by John Christopher, author of several trilogies. It begins in a small country town, perfectly normal, exept for the three-legged, mysterious all powerful tripods and metal mind-controlling caps. Will (the main character) is told to run away by a mysterious traveller. He is directed to the White Mountains, and with the help of his cousin and a french brainiack, they plunge into a thrilling plot filled with danger, action and exitement."
4,a fun-filled adventure to the future,"This book trully showed how much people don't wonder about their lives until someone like Ozymandias comes along and enlightens them. Worth reading, although it's confusing in some moments. This is the only book I have ever read written by John Christopher, but it seems like he is a creative writer."
2,So BORING,"The White Mountains was a boring book. It seemed like many books and tv shows I saw many times before. But, the book is not all bad I thought I would know the ending because the book like so many storys in other books and on tv, but the ending really surprised me. This is my review of John Cristphers book, The White Mountains."
3,A Hard Case might be better,"This Case is made to fit the XL, and it really does -- like a Glove. However, it is well padded on 3 sides -- but the least amount on the 4th (covering the Screen) it's where needed most IMO. Furthermore, I would not trust the Carry Strap that's held by a thick ""thread"". Better yet would be a detachable Carry Shoulder Strap.The Case is fairly expensive for what it does, but it does the job for the most part -- though I'm not sure how long it will last. It's black Suede finish is a real Lint collector.Do yourself a favor and Read DPK's excellent Review of 9/26/07 before you decide."
3,Please tell me they fired the editor,"I just happened upon this book, and being a huge fan of BtVS, i immediately grabbed it. I thought it was a great idea to put S7 into a novel. I just wish it would have been better written. Not only were there at least 2-3 typos per page, which became extremely irritating, but it seemed like there was no character development. If I hadn't followed the series on TV, then i would not have any insight into these characters. This book can not stand alone, but is a nice keepsake for true buffy fans. Read at your own risk.I gave this book three stars partially because i couldn't bear to give anything less to something that had to do with buffy. Also, it's nice to have something that came straight from the actual series in a novel form.I recommend this book only to true Buffy fans. Anyone else will probably hate it."
5,Season 7,"I loved this book, because Season 7 was my favorite Season of Buffy, and this is a novelization of the season.One thing ticks me off though...Why did the freaking publisher release this with the ending to the series finale ""Chosen"" in the book BEFORE the ""Chosen"" aired???How ridiculous."
1,"I should have ""Chosen"" a different book","Some points have already been made: Horrible editing, typos, great quotes, and moments taken out of the book: For instance in Beneath You, a bit of the Nancy story is gone, such as her line ""Any one here not sleep with each other"" something to take effect, it's been awhile since I've seen the episodeDon't know if it's just my copy, but during ""Conversations with Dead People"" it jumps from page 120 to 521 which terminates that episode novelization. That ticked me off"
5,Grassroots is one of 311's best,"Grassroots is one of 311's best cds with great tracks like ""Homebrew"", ""Lucky"", ""Tayed"", and most of the songs on the cd."
1,Don't trust Panther Networks,"I purchased the JBL On Tour Mobile Speakers and found out that Amazon has to use Panther Networks for this item. Well this is when the problems started. First, it took over 2 weeks for my speakers to arrive, Panther uses Parcel Post, the cheapest and slowest method. When it came, I could not get the system to turn on and the latch for the battery case was damaged. After contacting Panther Networks, they made me send the product back. I did, priority mail. When Panther got the product back they let me know that they were able to get the speakers working and that the battery cover was in fact damaged. They said that they were refunding my money less a $30.00 re-stocking fee. So now I am out $30 plus the $15 I spent to send the item back. Amazon, not Panther Networks fixed the problem by refunding me the rest of the money. Amazon was great, I trust them and will not hesitate to purchase things from them in the future. As far as Panther Networks goes.....I would stay away."
2,Disappointing,"Covering the the late 70's - early 80's incarnation of the band at the height of its MTV success, FLASHBACK really doesn't fit the bill as a greatest hits CD.With only 10 songs, from a limited time poeriod; it doesn't do the band justice. This CD is designed to cash in on their 80's success. The video hits are here, but if you really want something that represents this band, look elsewhere."
4,Picks Up The Best of EMI Days with Peter Wolf,"The original best release of 1985 contains the live version of their early hit I DO and the cover of Wilson Pickett hit LAND OF A THOUSAND DANCES recorded live. Also it has previously unreleased track WILD MAN.Legendary vocalist Peter Wolf departed the band around 1984 and released a solo LIGHTS OUT. Naturally this compilation tries to stress the aura of Peter Wolf rathar than simply showing the band's hits. As some of the tracks introduced here such as LOVE STINKS, FLAME THROWER, and COME BACK show J Geils. Band is the straight rock band rivaling the legend Billy Squire. Then since late 70s they took power pop approach and huge hits such as FREEZE-FRAME and CENTERFOLD were made. 10-track compilation is a bit too short to introduce their music but generally enjoyable.Verdict: Centered on late 70s to 80s hits but enjoyable.Rating: 82 out of 100. Maybe makes us want to listen to their songs more.Recommended for late 70s to early 80s power pop fans."
1,As disappointing as the Product (Websphere),Full of Junk...Waste of money and time. This is a defective book about a defective product..
4,"Go fast, turn left, and accessorize!","I bought these for my Ford F150, but then moved them to my Jeep Wrangler. They got a little lost in the black/gray interior of the truck, but are a perfect complement to the cherry-red Jeep. And they look more at home in the sassier environment. They are large, a perfect fit for a serious vehicle, and they have a heavy, durable feel. I have had no problems with them slipping out of place; they stay put. The Dale Jr. signature doesn't stand out in quite the same way it does in the photo, and I'm happier with that. Showing one's NASCAR love need not be gaudy. I do advise that you keep them dry. I got mine wet while washing my Jeep after a big snowstorm, and the rubber on the bottom got a little smelly. The situation was easily remedied with a day of drying out in the garage. Go Junior!"
5,Good reference,I found this book to be a good reference for the CCIE written exam. It has some awesome questions and great technology overviews.
5,Great Review Material,"Excelent study guide. Chapters, questions and explanations are well organized and detailed."
3,An overview,"This is a fairly good introduction into international film. Its relative brevity is perhaps a plus for beginning students of film, who do not want to buy several books. But I found it inadequate. It only briefly mentions the major names, films, styles, themes, movements, etc, and as a survey its approach is too linear. Supplemental books are needed to get a satisfactory understanding of the history. The book is a summary that works to increase your curiosity."
3,Not what I expected,"The book arrived in a timely manner but was more worn than the description of ""Used-Very Good"" implied. I wouldn't described the condition of the book as any better than ""Good."" I might think twice before ordering from them again."
5,spice rack,"i gave this to my daughter in law for christmas, but was very tempted to keep for myself. this is a beautiful spice rack, with such a nice selection of spices. it looks just wonderful on her kitchen counter. all of the spices are fresh and sealed. a great purchase."
3,You get what you pay for,This item looks great on the picture but when it arrived it was very light weight and made from cheap plastic. It does the job adequately but on close inspection it looks and feels very cheap. Don't buy this to go in your high-end kitchen. You will be disappointed.
2,Not like the old one,"We bought this for our 3 year old daughter b/c my hubby and I both remember how much we loved having one when we were growning up. This new version is just not the same! The base is barely big enough for her to sit on (and she's VERY petite) and it does not spin as ""freely"" as the old ones did (probably b/c of all the electronics). The ""talking"" is pointless...she just wants to try to spin on it, not follow the ""Simon Says"" directions. I give it 2 stars b/c she LOVES to use it as a stool to sit up to our coffee table and color or use her play laptop."
2,Sit and Spin no longer what is used to be,"This Sit and Spin took several months of waiting before my daughter and son could use it. Unlike the Sit and Spins from the 80's that spun VERY easily and made you ill, this one lacks fun. It's slow and ackward. Both of my kids need us to help spin them, which gets old. I was so disappointed with this product. I assume someone must have gottn hurt on the older models (I KNOW I DID :-) and I think this product reflects too many safety measures. What fun is it if you can't use it?"
1,Who builds this junk?,"Very poor quality. Would not recommend. Seat is so small and narrow due to its oval shaped configuration that my thin little two year old daughter hangs off it. It is all very lightweight plastic and easilt turns over and of course she falls off. This is very frustrating to her and to me as well. I would love to return it, but we got it as a christmas present and I don't have the box or receipt. This definitely should be recalled. Who builds this stuff? Remember the old days when the sit n spin had a nice round, heavy base that you could spin real fast for hours. Very, very poor construction and quality!!!"
1,Not big enough.....,"This Sit n' Spin is barely big enough for my 2 and 4 year old to sit on, and they are considered small to average size for their ages. Trying to get it to spin is difficult for young children, since their upper body strength is limited. I would not recommend this product."
3,too hard for littler ones,The age on this toy starts at 15 months I believe. My son is almost 2 and a half and has just now learned to spin it. It is very difficult and i think that it had to be broken in. My son does love the music but it took forever to get it broken in. Definetely for older stronger kids.
4,Lots of Fun!!,"I bought this toy of my 2 grandchildren, ages 3 and 7. So far they love it. Granted, my 7 yr old is barely able to fit on it and it won't be long before he outgrows the toy (he wants to know why they can't make it bigger). My three year old has a ball, especially with the ""Simon Says"" feature. I do agree that it does not work a well on a carpet. It tends to slow down the spinning, but all in all, both kids love it!!"
2,Toy is undersized for age classification.,We have a 2 year old daughter. I thought the toy was undersized for her. She is tall for her age and was barely able to keep herself on the toy while siting. I had one of these as a child and remeber them being a lot bigger.
1,Sit n' Sit.,"This is the most worthless piece of plastic I've ever seen. I bought this for my niece, remembering how much fun I had with one as a kid. Everyone said the same thing when she opened it. ""Awesome! I loved mine as a kid."" Then she tried to spin on it, and we all ""booed."" Nice job, Playskool. You made a Sit n' Spin that doesn't spin. Bad design, cheap materials, annoying music. Avoid this at all costs."
3,Mildly disappointed,"My daughter (and myself, me more than her) dislikes the oval configuration of this product. I seem to recall from my youth that the original used to be fully circular and not oval. The circular pattern was a much better design for this item, keeping it stable no matter where the child sat. She doesn't knock it over yet but I fear that when she finally starts to use it full speed that that is a possibility. Aside from that she loves it, although she still doesn't remember which way the button switches for music and which way it switches for Simon Says and gets very aggravated when she turns simon on."
1,Not the greatest!!,"My daughter is 3 and barelt fits on the toy I cant imagine how a 5 yr old would sit on it. As with other reviews its very loud with no volume.. My daughter enjoyed the concept , not so much the toy"
2,changes over the years...,"I would love to rate this product higher, but I was expecting something more reminiscent of my own childhood. Didn't they used to be bigger? and round?Luckily for me I purchased this way too early for DS because he will outgrow it by the time he is ""old enough"" for it.He can get it to spin a half a turn at t a time so far, but even as a little guy he hardly fits on the thing.He loves the music and really likes to dance to it.We are definitely goin to keep it around, perhaps not as long as we'd hoped, but nothing is perfect for everyone."
2,Save your money--Junk!!,"I bought this toy for my 18 month old daughter Ava because she had so much fun on the one over at her grandparents. I got it and put it together. It is a waste of 25.00. Its so cheap, tips over easily, is hard for the child to spin, and the awkward oval shape is so stupid. Save your money and buy a different type."
4,My kids really enjoy it!!,Santa brought this for my 3 year old for Christmas. She doesn't play with it everyday but when she does she really enjoys it. Even my 7 year old enjoys playing with it. They both have no trouble getting it to spin. I will have to agree with others that the music is pretty annoying. There were no problems putting it together. I wish that it would spin on carpet and then I wouldn't have to listen to the music. I would purchase this again.
3,Oleta Adams can sing names out of a phone book and sound great!,I am a huge Oleta Adams fan and I wanted to love this CD.I know Christmas CD's don't have the production budget that a mainstream CD might have. I know that Oleta Adams recorded it at her studio at home and these two factors may have worked against it.First off what I loved about this CD.Track 5Breath of HeavenTrack 7There's Still My Joy.both of these tracks sound like they could have easily been lifted from Oleta's 5 star gospel CD Come Walk with Me. Just Oleta and piano and that magnificent voice.I did like track 4 I Wonder as I Wonder which Oleta puts her own spin on this timeless classic.The rest of this sounds like Oleta and her beautiful voice singing to a kareoki track.I would have loved Oleta to record CD using a live band or orchestra.Still there is enough excellence on this CD to make this a part of your collection. After all Oleta can never do wrong in my book.
2,Not the best,This reman part has lasted only 11 months. That's not good enough for me. My G35 coupe is 6 years old with 60K and now I'm on my third window lift motor. Why is it a US car can have a window lift that lasts 80-100K and Nissan can't? So I'm looking for another part manufacturer.
2,not what I expected,"I ordered this bag when my baby was 6 months old, because I needed a more substantial yet good looking bag. I was really dissapointed in the quality of the bag as well as the matrial it was made of. It looked nice in the pic but once I checked it out after it arrived it went right back in the box and right back to Amazon."
5,Can I Give It 6 Stars?,"This is the most amazing toy I've ever seen. It's positively fascinating! My 10 year old son received it for Christmas and spent the next hour or two exploring the different features, including the Spanish-English cartridge. Other entries have explained how it works and what it does, so I won't repeat here. It was well worth $99, and will be well worth the $10 or so, when new paper needs to be purchased, which won't be that often. I highly recommend getting the charger, too, which provides a docking station while the unit charges, as well as two rechargeable batteries--one extra, to be ready and charged and waiting to use. Don't bother with a case or speaker--you get a case and earbuds with it, and the pen already has a speaker...not sure why you'd spend extra $ on those accessories. This is an exceptionally well designed toy with years of future enjoyment in it."
5,Monster Pop Hits,"All original versions of her best-known tunes, including all three #1s. Not the complete Helen Reddy, but about all that most music lovers will need."
3,The burdens of conscience,"There's not a lot of raison d'etre for this very amusing comedy of British class life, centered upon a decades-long academic controversy, other than to show the consequences of conscience upon an elderly wealthy history professor. This book, which has been out of print for a few years in the US, is still quite enjoyable, and the cadre of curious characters that populate it are as memorable in their own way as those out of Dickens (to whom Wilson is often compared). There is a kind of creepiness in the latent homophobia of the comic ending (everyone receives his or her just desserts, which means in this case the major gay characters are killed or maimed), but the novel is of a different and earlier time.The description of Ingeborg Middleton's hideously frolicsome Nordic Christmas party alone makes the novel worth reading."
4,Benny Hill is great,"I've been watching Benny Hill for almost 15 years. I've come to the point where I fall out of my chair laughing as soon as I see his face. He doesn't even have to speak to get me laughing. His comedy is of a different style, but if you watch, you will soon be rolling in the floor. Very entertaining."
2,too young to get away with this material,"i just don't understand why people would find this poor young boy's voice interesting. both light in range with ridiculous choice of material for a teenager. hyped as another cabaret find, i went off and saw him live but found him very unconvincing. oh draxl hype machine concentrate on substance not headline."
1,TOO YOUNG FOR THESE OLD STANDARDS,"No doubt a delightful future lies ahead for a young man with charm, but it seems criminal and far too premature to push Tim Draxl as ''the next David Campbell'' from Australia, and this CD offers proof. This overhyped teen-ager lacks the life experience to imbue these songs with anything special. For example, the classic cabaret song ''Flight'' is basically about a man going through a midlife crisis (''I don't care if the checks don't clear''); Mr. Draxl lacks the maturity or the emotions or the vocals to fill it. His voice should be soaring into the skies, but here it barely gets off the ground. Also, Mr. Draxl has trouble sustaining notes, especially when they come at the end of his songs, notably ''Ordinary Miracles.'' If Mr. Draxl could choose better material that's more age appropriate (like ''No One Is Alone'') and get to a good vocal coach, he'd make a much better impression."
4,"A Most Impressive Artist TV, CD or LIVE","I learned of Mr. Draxl on The Rosie O'Donnell Show and was impressed enough to see him perform live at Firebird's here in New York City. He is only eighteen yet it is his youth that brings a fresh interpretation and exuberance to such timeless standards as ""Someone to Watch Over Me"" and ""As Time Goes By."" ""No One Is Alone"" and ""Flight"" are in my opinion his best numbers although he does a fine job on the title track ""Ordinary Miracles."" The selection in this debut CD showcases an impressive vocal range and emotional depth that stand to those of most acts twice or trice Mr. Draxl's age. It is satisfying to know that cabaret will be alive and well and available to a new generation thanks to acts like his. This young man will be going places. You've heard it here first."
4,A must for all literature teachers,"If you teach literature (at any level) and haven't read this book, you probably don't know what you are doing."
5,Like a boss!,"Wasn't to hard to install, works perfect without fail. The device does come with some heat shrink connector seals that they want you to shrink, so if you don't have a hair dryer you may not be able to shrink them. ***DO NOT USE FIRE as you are working on your gas tank... I changed this and bought the Wix fuel filter at the same time. Change your filter every 20k miles or at least test by blowing in it to make sure your air flows freely through it. If it doesn't the fuel can't either and this can cause your pump to work harder and fail. If your fuel gauge is jumping and/or doesn't show the accurate fuel level, it is possible that you need to buy a new fuel pump."
4,Only Put it Down if the Kettle Boils,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Although it did not evoke the sense or fabric of the period (one always wondered when the hell this took place) fortunately there was a description of the odd car that helped. I would not have read this book had not Pat Barker (Regeneration, Eye in the Door, Ghost Road ..Booker Prize) suggested it. I can understand why. It is a real thriller and a joy to rush through. Airth does not have the depth of Pat Barker nor the expereince but given time I think Airth will go beyond the watery fare of Patricia Cornwall and her ilk and provide us with the option I think we need. It is not the cookie cutter thriller that gets served up by Grisham and Cornwall. Not predictable and well written."
2,Overkill,"I have to agree with MedStudent SD about this book. Much of the text is simply a rehashing of the tables and charts. As a grad student, I think I know how to read a table or chart without a block of text telling me exactly what the table/chart just told me. The statistics spouted were, more than likely, outdated by the time the book became available for sale. Also, there are many more ways to be a ""vulnerable population"" than just being a minority, of low socioeconomic status, and uninsured. Those are the only three topics covered in this book while ignoring so many other influences. Some big missed opportunities here."
2,Bad quality,"The adjustable cable is too big for the door knob, I adjusted the cable and still too big. If you pull the cable a little hard, it will come out. From 1 to 5 I'll give it a 1. I'm not satisfied with the product, Could have gotten something better for a few dollars more.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GTOUJ2/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title"
3,very similar to The Circular Staircase,"As I read, I kept thinking I'd read it before under the name The Circular Staircase. A search on the web didn't turn up any information comparing the two books, both by Mary Roberts Rinehart."
3,Potential squashed - again and again,"Potential is stiffled, over and over again, in Robert Draper's first novel, and not just that of his protagonist. The book is like a happy-sad story, in terms of its quality. Draper does some quite wonderful things, then you flip a page and find mind-numbing exposition or simply unbelievable turns of event. The ending, in particular, is disappointing. Complications after what should have been the climax just leave the whole thing fizzling. The dialogue is good, but the language of the novel is convoluted. Despite its occasional bursts of greatness, I find it hard to recommend Hadrian's Walls."
4,Great product for the price,"Great product with clear transmissions, but a little loud in my ear when mic is keyed on and off and the headband isn't adjustable... It's made for bigger heads. Otherwise it's good-to-go."
3,Good replacement headsets,"The headsets are kinda big for me. When i tried to adjust the wire that goes around your head, the wire broke. It's harden steel and it won't bend very easily. Mine was bent to close to the ear piece which required some adjustment. It broke at the 90 degree bend. Been much better to use a wire that could've bent without breaking. I had to disassemble the ear piece, very careful bend and adjust them to finally work. Ear speaker and mic are good quality, just be careful when adjustment is needed."
1,okay he's yours,if you're that open minded call that girl up and ya'll can do a threesome I admit I slept with women and fantasized about threesomes myself so yeah I'm into that stuff did'nt care for this group but these girls were fine.
5,change of life,"Growing up listening to the entire SST and IRS catalog in the 80's you don't think much about the subject matter of this album, but approaching 40 this album really spoke to me."
3,not to impressed,"i had never heard of descendants before, but im a nerd, and i like punk, so i bought it. i just wasnt that impressed though. first it really sucked, then i warmed up to it and now like three or four songs; still though, if i dont like every single song of a CD it makes me sad. i think i just didnt like the bitterness. it makes me sad and a little angry, like they are just mean and judging everyone unfairly. maby i would have liked it better if i had heard some of their other stuff first, i geuss ill never know. i just dont recomend this for first time listeners of this band."
4,What are some of you people smoking?,"I am amazed at how many people are saying this release is a let down. I just don't get it. The great thing about the descendents is that you know your always gonna get quality, and this one is no different. Talking, Nothing with you, She don't care, Mass Nerder, I could go on and on, these are classic descendents songs. This is the greatest punk band ever, and they continue to make songs most bands could only dream of.Nerds Rule."
4,"A wonderful read, but I didn't like the ending too much.","I was immediately drawn into this story and identified with the main character. Wonderfully written. Rick was overcome with grief and guilt over losing his unborn child and we learned his thinking, and felt his emotions,as he coped. But I ask you, Mr. Lott, did he have to get in bed naked with another woman and very nearly make love to her in order figure out that he still loved his wife? How do you think this made the other woman, who was a fine person, feel? I would think Rick would be even more guilt-ridden because, at the end of the book, he lists the things he will now talk with his wife about, and this other woman isn't on the list! Great writing but I'm not so sure about the ending."
4,An excellet nicely structured auditory program with clear tones.,"Pronunciation and tones are very clear. Vocabulary words are used in a variety of phrases so that you can learn the transitions from one tone to another. Useful phrases are grouped to teach some basic sentence structures which makes it more likely that you will be able to make independent phrases or sentences of your own rather than just memorizing some fixed phrases. The program suggests that you repeat lessons several times. I needed to repeat many times. I found the printed transcription of each lesson a useful supplement to the repeat after me tapes. As with any auditory program, there is less opportunity to develop comprehension. The booklet refers to the possibility of turning off the English prompts. That would help comprehension but I can't make it work on my conventional car CD player."
2,Solo para incondicionales,"En Realidad es un disco muy disparejo, ya que no se puede mezclar las canciones de la manera que se realizo aqui, rescatable SEE EMELY PLAY, de la epoca Barret, pero el resto es lo mismo que ya has escuchado...solo para clavados (este,mm, yo lo tengo , jeje)"
3,"No ideas, just put together a compilation!","At the time this CD was made, PF was having a lot of trouble, so instead of making new songs, they put together a compilation. It has a lot of good songs, though."
2,"Just download ""Embryo""","This is a totally useless Pink Floyd compilation that only has one redeeming quality, and that's the unreleased track ""Embryo."" Most die hard PF fans will know that this album was never approved by the band for release. This was just another cash grab by the greedy record companies, who threw on ""Embryo"" (which the band stated wasn't even finished yet) as a ploy to entice collectors.As a compilation goes, it's not even a very good one. The one track they use from ""UmmaGumma"" is ""Several Species....""? Then there is absolutely nothing from ""Piper"" or ""Atom Heart Mother.""There are some classic Floyd songs here: ""One of These Days,"" ""Brain Damage,"" ""Eclipse,"" ""See Emily Play"" etc. But there are far superior compilations than this to choose from. Most Floyd fans will tell you to just buy the individual albums, then buy ""Relics"" to collect the singles. I couldn't agree more. If a compilation is the only thing you want to buy, then go with ""Echoes."""
2,"THIS IS NOT A ""HOW TO"" BOOK - THE TITLE IS A LIE","I began to read this book, wondering how this writer proposed wecommon folk change the government. About halfway through, after the author trashed money-grubbing polititians, false pollsters, andthe distorted media, I still had yet to read a word about overthrowing anything; I started to skip pages...I know how bad things are in Washington - I really never found any ideas, or information, unless you consider dropping the MoveOn.com website as her idea of an overthrow proposal? Yes, it's a decently written litany of the sins of current political affairs, BUT, when the contents of a book does not connect with the title, well, that's a ""D"" in my grade book."
2,Where's the beef?,"Ms. Huffington describes some of the outrages currently going on in Washington in a forthright and witty way. But as a how-to manual on how to overthrow the government, this is a joke. Give more to charity and say no to pollsters? Gimme a break, Arianna, that's not going to do it. Where's the beef?"
4,Pretty Good,"I love the music. Its a really good bunch of songs but to be honest it gets a little old kinda quick if you don't know the lyrics. That doesn't mean don't make the purchase, just look up the english lyrics first so you can get the most out of the music. Enjoy!"
4,The Clue in the Diary,"This story is about an 18-year-old girl named Nancy Drew who likes to solve mysteries. She usually solves her mysteries with her two best friends, Bess Marvin, a girl who loves to eat and George Fayne, a tomboy.While Nancy, George, and Bess were returning from a country carnival, they saw an explosion of a beautiful country mansion. Nancy and her friends were worried that people might be trapped in the mansion, so they went in to save them. While they were in the mansion, they found a diary lying on the floor. Nancy and her friends brought the diary home and found themselves a new mystery for them to solve. They're first clue was a diary. Its entries were in a writing that is very hard for them to decipher. There were also technical drawings and chemical formulas that were contained in the diary's pages. Would they solve the mystery? The question was answered when Nancy found out whom the diary belongs to."
3,Funny But Unrealistic,"The book Banana Blitz was quite funny in places (especially the relationship between Jonah and Goober), but the plot set up was unrealistic. It's not believable that parents could send their son off to boarding school without knowing what actually went on there regarding junk food, television, etc. Without giving away the ending, I'll just say that it was also not very believable. However, this book is a children's story, so that can be forgiven. Overall, this book was well written and very funny."
4,Ancient Roman Judicial System,"Lindsey Davis' new Falco book is another good one. In this one Falco becomes embroiled in a court case and we actually get to see him in action in a court room. Falco and his associates (his two brother-in-laws) are hired to help a young senator as he fights to defend himself from the accusation of killing his father. On the way they become exposed to one of the most disfunctional families you'll ever come across. This liaison could end up costing Falco his whole net worth and then some, because if a court case is brought against someone and they are judged innocent, the advocate is ordered by the court to pay compensation which is determined by the rank of the individual who was accused. Ms. Davis books keep getting better it seems. She manages to keep her Falco interesting and fun through each of them. I haven't enjoyed a series so much since Brother Cadfael."
5,Buy this book!!,This has been a wonderful addition to my Spanish class. It is a great workbook that has really helped me practice the very numerous Spanish verb tenses. I love it! I'm going to buy the other Practice Makes Perfect Spanish workbooks. I DEFINITELY recommend this book!
5,Great series,This is one in a great series of Spanish study books. Lots of exercises so you can really practice. Also the organization makes for a great reference. My English grammar is terrible so I have a hard time figuring out what tense I want to use. The beginning of each section has an explanation of how the tenses translate. The pronouns and prepositions book is also great.
5,Excellent Book to improve Spanish,This book is really helpful for people who has middle knowledge of Spanish. The exercises are great and the Spanish is the good Spanish.
5,Excellent refresher,This is an excellent refresher for people who have the Spanish basics and want to review. Very well organized and fun to work with. I use it almost every day and am reawakening many memories from Spanish classes of yore.
5,Excellent and very uplifting because it gets to the point,"I bought this book over 6 years ago. I really thought it helped. Unfortunately, I never practiced my Spanish enough.But this book helps you get the tenses correct. Even Mexican Americans use incorrect verb tenses when they speak Spanish.Being American I really think this is really the only book that really gets to the point. I have never and will never find a better book about Spanish verb tenses than this one."
1,Poor Quality,wore this item once. Waist draw string broke. One tug on the draw string and that was it. Very cheap material.
2,disappointed,Rather disappointed in the quality of the item. I have purchased other windshirts and found this one to be a very low quality
5,squee?!,this book was just great the episodes were alot like it i'd give this book a 2 thumbs up and plus it rocks apperantly muso oh wait can't tell you have 2 find out 4 urself but i tell you even kikyo is in on it ><!!!-inusessha
1,It WOULD be great IF it WORKED!!,"My daughter got this Pony for Christmas. She loves My Little Ponys. After about 2 hours of play she brought it to me....IT NO LONGER WORKED, at all. I thought maybe she had done something or that it was the batteries. So we tried everything....still not working. Not even in Demo mode. So I came online to look at other customer reviews and realized I should have read them BEFORE buying it. How can HASBRO make and sale something that they have to know does this. All the toys are tested before hand right? HORRIBLE!"
1,Sad Christmas surprise!,"My daughter, 4, flipped when she saw this on TV. It looks so real! It doesn't live up to it in real life. We could only get it to work in demo mode. In play mode- nothing we did would wake it up even after changing the batteries! Fortunately there were other toys to make up for this sad Christmas surprise!"
1,Unbelievable,"I can't believe what a waste of money this toy was. I also can't believe how good a commercial can make a toy look. My 4 year old daughter got this for Christmas and she played with it once. It's now thrown in a toy bin. I guess it would be ok if it was $10. It says 2 phrases. Good morning Mommy, let's play. What fun is that? It's one of 3 toys that I wish I had saved the box for because I would take it back and get her something better."
4,Okay overall,We purchased these for use while snomobiling. One works fine but the other has lots of static. The adhesive for the mic doesn't work well and there are lots of wires to work around. Sound quality could be a little better. Product works fine considering the price and we have nothing to compare it to.
3,2 of 3 components are good.,"The helmet speakers are absolutely useless. Anything over 10-15 mph and you can't hear them even with the Midland GMRS radio at max. volume ( and I have a nice quiet full face helmet ). However the mic, PTT button and cabling appear to be good quality.The good news is I solved the problem myself inexpensively: cut the helmet speakers off, solder on a 3.5 mm stereo female connector, and use in-ear noise isolating earbuds and voila, at 1/2 volume on the Midland GMRS radios it works like a charm even at freeway speeds.Why Midland would put them out with speakers with such low output is strange, just ""testing"" the system sitting in the house I knew the speakers were going to be very inadequate."
3,Worked okay.,"Bought with midland two-way radios for snowmobiling. Some problems I expected, like having to deal with all of the cords and the hassle when trying to put your helmet on and take it off. One problem that I didn't expect was that the moisture from my breathing eventually destroyed the glue that held the foam on the microphone, and then the moisture destroyed the microphone. So they lasted for one weekend trip. I could understand my partner when we were stopped, but I could only hear her voice when we were driving; I couldn't make out what she was saying."
4,Cheap motorcycle-to-motorcycle communications,"I bought a pair of these with a pair of Midland radios (LXT440s, less than $50 for the pair) and my son and I now have bike-to-bike communications on the road. Also works bike-to-car etc. Volume is a little bit low, but compared to high-end units ($250+ for one bike) you can't beat the price."
3,Not for Everybody,"If you are like Dr. Albion (a talented Harvard Business School professor -- well educated, rich, connected), then this book offers you a formula for dealing with mid-life crises. If you're common folk, you will have to stretch to pick up the nuggets from this book. Plusses: some wonderful insights and quotes in this book. Minuses: inconsistent."
5,OUTSTANDING!,"This cd takes me on a spiritual journey in sound.Each song evokes an emotional feeling,through the inspirational and melodic grooves. I hear and feel different emotions with each listen. This group is outstanding individually, and collectively. I truly believe this body of music will stand the test of time as a great recording.If this is an example of what's in store from Josh, I can't wait to hear the next release. I am not going to try to comment on the technical nuances of each song, I will just say with each listen of this cd I am taken ""Beyond"" on a beautiful emotional journey."
1,Dissapointing,"I guess that I must not be a jazz expert because I find this CD to be a big dissapointment. The songs that are to be uptempo aren't and the ballads are boring. Perhaps I am have been accustomed to listening to the Oscar Peterson's and Roy Hargrove's of this world. These guys know how to put together a good CD. By the end of this Cd, I was bored. I guess they won't let me send it back."
4,Might even be a tribute to the saxophone itself.,"What I liked about this album, perhaps the most enjoyable from this artist, was the complete ease his playing conveys throughout. Whether lyrical as on ""Courage"" or upbeat as on ""Stoic"" or sensuous and melodic almost Ben Websterish on ""Twilight ...and beyond"" Mr Redman is completely at ease, with nothing to prove. If Mr Charles Parker was right when he said ""If you don't live it, it won't come out of your horn"" then Mr Redman is one contended human with Peace in his heart. I loved the tongueing - slapping a la early Hawk on ""Last Rites of Rock and Roll"" which was a real hoot. Overall, a very well conceived and well played album worthy of many many listenings."
4,A good value!,"They do take a few washes to start absorbing, but they are better quality than the off the shelf towels from most department stores. For the money it's worth it."
5,Carl Pool's BR-61,"This stuff should be called Jack-and-the-Beanstalk Juice! I purchased several plumerias toward the end of last season - some I planted in the ground and some are in pots. I bought from 3 different seasoned sellers who specialize in them, and ALL THREE recommended this fertilizer. It's early June and only the beginning of the growing season for these beauties, and already lush dark green leaves are bushing out! I cannot wait to see the gorgeous variety of vibrant colors I know are on the way! It will be time to buy more soon, and Amazon had the best price, so I'll be back!"
5,Great!,This halter humanely reminds my young golden to walk without extreme pulling. He doesn't mind wearing it at all which is important too!
5,Sporn Pet Halter,"We ordered, the Sporn Pet Halter to help control our dog on walks. Right from the very beginning the halter proved its worth by providing good control of our dog. Our dog is an 80 lb. Doberman and is hard to control. Still have some excitement problems , but control with the Sporn is easier."
2,Not as excited,"I was really looking forward to getting this book, but was disappointed. As a Rev War Reenactor I was looking for some really good insights. However, I was disappointed to find that the book was originally printed in 1940 and that many of the resources were previously published books (so read pre-1940!) Current research is much more advanced than it was in 1940! (For those of you who aare like me - remember the English Bodice!)Dates were very general and any portraits or art were undated.If you are a generalist, than this book mught be OK, but if you are someone looking to interpret a time period accurately, I'd recommend Linda Baumgarten, Sharon Burnston or Aileen Ribiero instead.As for me, I'm returning the book!"
1,A wonderful reference...,A terrific resource for anyone interested in fashion accessories throughout the ages. Wonderful descriptions and illustrations of the various accessories used by both men and women.
1,these are terrible,these are terrible. i drowned it in sriracha sauce to and it's the first thing i've found that even sriracha can't fix. i don't see what others are seeing in this flavor. yuck.
3,NOT THE ORIGINAL RECORDINGS!!!!,"An earlier reviewer claimed that some of these titles were remixes on this particular collection. They are way more than that - they are RE-RECORDED!And very pale compared to the originals.Buyer beware!A much better choice would be ""The Ultimate Collection""Twice as many songs and every one is original!"
3,Looking for Wildfire with Piano intro and Close!,"I have not heard this album but am looking for the version of the ""Wildfire"" track with the great piano solo intro and close. Based on other reviews, this CD does not have that version. The Sagebrush Symphony also does not appear to be the one either with one reviewer citing a ""different version than what you might be used to"". Can anyone help me out? Please email me at bradd@concordtrans.com if you can provide any assistance."
5,One of the best of the genre,"This CD has most of MMMs best work. Geronimo's Cadillac is poignant. Wildfire was a chart topper in the mid 70s. By the way, MMM has a web site where you can buy the original CD which has the version of Wildfire with the piano intro and exit. It is still hauntingly beautiful 30 years later. Reminiscent of Billy Joel's early work (""The Legend of Billy the Kid"") and Dan Fogelberg's first album, ""Homefree"". They don't make music like this anymore...."
2,Bear Naked is better,"If you are looking for granola, Bear Naked is hands down the best.nobody beats their quality and taste.Bear Naked All-Natural Granola, Fruit and Nut, 12-Ounce Bags (Pack of 6)"
5,Incredible Story!!!,I just wanted to say that I could not put your book down. The story was intriguing and grabbed me from the begginning and never let go.Thanks
5,Captivating,I am not normally a mystery reader or really any reader at all but upon picking up Control I was addicted to its' tone and story line. Definitly a recommended book for the picky reader!
3,Swell,"Light, thin watch that feels comfortable to wear. Other Skagen watches I have owned have lasted only a few weeks before the crystal shattering. I like the styles and functions of Skagen watches but their quality matches their low price. That is not necessarily bad, I have had thousand dollar watches break, at least with these I shed less tears and I can go buy another watch from the multiple styles they have. Great casual watch...enjoy."
1,trashy,"This commentary on Freud's biggest book is rather characteristic of the books being written these days. Its argument is tendentious and its scholarship trashy. To mention a random example, Welsh points out Freud's habit of never having discussions after reading papers, quoting Jones (his only source) for support. Now, I would advise Professor Welsh to do a little bit of research on this subject--5 minutes of research and careful reading would suffice to prove the contrary. It seems to be a recent trend to believe Jones whenever he writes something stupid, and ignore everything else. Professor Welsh is just another one of those trendy academics who are ready to jump on Freud whenever they see a chance. His strategy of calling Freud a product of the 19th century is old, really old, as if our malicious professor hasn't read much of the anti-Freudian literature either. This book is simply weak"
5,Exceptionally interesting - great for non-scientists as well,"I am not a scientist, but very much enjoy biographies. I read this book on a friend's recommendation, and literally could not stop turning the pages. Darlington, the man and the scientist, is truly brought to life on these pages.I found the story behind Harman's `unlikely scientific hero' consistently engaging. The author does a superb job of seamlessly weaving together the many colorful strands of the social and scientific fabric that served as backdrop to Darlington's life. With Harman as a guide, the reader gains a unique first-hand appreciation for Darlington's days, reliving them as heady times for genetics in particular and for society as a whole.A must-read for all those in the know. Amongst the best biographies I have come across."
5,Photographers vest,An awesome photographers vest...holds it all...a must for every photographer...it holds it all!A great price for a great product....!!
1,Misleading and dumb,"So basically I bought this as a joke for my roommate. I was so excited. Then I received the soap and it was a regular piece of face soap but there was a sticker covering a little hole in the back side with black powder. Not what I expected or would have desired in such a product. What seemed to be a white bar of soap that turns skin black, was nothing more then something my two year old sister could have made. Product FAIL."
1,Worst Prank EVER,Ok so I tell my sister to try it so we can prank our cousins and its just soap......there is nothing dirty about it except the false advertising
5,Beautiful Watch!,Blue and gold is a great color combo. Lots of compliments on this watch! It is a large watch but i love not needing a battery!
2,Blast off...,"The two stars I give this are for ""La Luna"" and ""He Doesn't See Me"" - the only two songs on this CD worth anything. I had expected something different, I suppose, and I learned never to buy a CD songs unheard. There was a rather disturbing quality that pervaded the whole CD - and I don't have any idea why. I don't recall that any of the songs were bad (content wise). It was just a feeling.I would recommend the Andrew Lloyd Webber Collection, The Phantom of the Opera (Original London Cast), or Eden for some truly good gems from Sarah."
2,"disspointing, too produced, too much technology","I am highly dissapointed in this album, especially Sarah Brightman's cover photo which in my opinion is full of vanity. I find this album to represent no personal talent. Everything is technological and spacy feeling. I dislike greatly how it makes me feel. ""Here with Me"" is terribly weak. What is ""This Love"" about anyway? Such poor lyrics. This album proves only to be full of tease and vanity. Sarah is full of guile and I see no innocence nor wisdom in her as I do in other female artists such as Lisa Gerrard. Now that woman needs to make it big! Not this barbie doll who pretends she is an angel. This is a very poor, immature album! I wanted to be honest."
4,Good Bio balls different bucket as picture.,"Good product, good price.The bio balls look like good quality.Only thing not 100% satisfied is the bucket that holds the balls is not the one pictured from the listing."
5,Charmingly honest,"Have you ever listened to a song that made you think that the writer was inside your head like they were talking about how you felt? and you can feel every emotion of the song in yourself well this whole cd is like that for me, its great. And the music is brilliantly put together ellectric pop, with a hint of folk. I love the way Blake's voice just flows so smoothly over the music..."
1,Where are the songs?,"I was really dissappointed with this record, having heard about what a great songwriter she is. While her voice is pleasant (albeit she overdoes the breathy/pseudo-seductive thing) I was underwhelmed by her writing ability. It's just trite melodies and tired chord progressions docotored up with Dragonetti's sound wizardry."
5,Revealing Look at Psychology,"Lauren Slater is one of the best writers on psychology in America today. This is fitting as Slater herself has experienced her share of psychological trauma.Her latest book, Opening Skinner's Box, is an investigation into 10 of the most infamous psychological experiments in American history. Slater is an excellent popularizer of information generated by academic research. Slater is also judgmental of psychologists who mess things up such as Elizabeth Loftus of the widely discredited False Memory Syndrome.This book is an honest and revealing look at the world of psychology as it really is."
2,Fiction,"Although presented as non-fiction, this book is actually fiction, and readers should be cautioned not to take anything in it seriously. Many reviewers have already described the many inaccuracies in the book, so I will not repeat them here. Reading this book is comparable to reading wikipedia - it's all just one person's biased opinion. If you want to know what really happened in the experiments described in this book, all you have to do is read any introductory psychology text, or the original articles. Most people are so lazy they prefer reading dumbed down, fictional versions as presented in books like this. Reading this book will just make you more ignorant."
3,Review of the reviews,"I have not read this book yet but wanted to point out a fact to anyone reading these reviews that I found extremely interesting. Of the 19 preceeding reviews, six (6) rate it one star, twelve (12) rate it five stars, and only one rates it in the 2-4 star range. This tells me a lot about the passions evoked by the subject as well as the book.As for me, I am going to take the advice of reviewer oola from NJ United States and preview it at the library first.(PS. I had to put in a rating to post this review so I used a three - middle of the road - to skew the average as little as possible.)"
1,Gets way too many facts just plain wrong,"This book is about many famous psychologists and about their research. The single biggest problem is that the accounts of famous experiments in psychology, like Rosenhan's and Milgram's, are so full of factual errors that I find it hard to treat ANYTHING else in the book seriously. There are experimental design features detailed in the book that were not part of those studies. Despite what some here say, all you have to do is actually read Rosenhan or Milgram to know that this book just plain gets VERY important facts about what they did wrong......."
3,Finite Mathematics solutions to accompany the textbook,"Designed to be accessible, this book develops a thorough, functional understanding of mathematical concepts in preparation for their application in other areas. Coverage concentrates on developing concepts and ideas followed immediately by developing computational skills and problem solving. This book features a collection of important topics from mathematics of finance, linear algebra, linear programming, probability, and statistics, with an emphasis on cross-discipline principles and practices. For the professional who wants to acquire essential mathematical tools for application in business, economics, and the life and social sciences."
3,No customer service,"Speakers sounded ok for money. Screw for thumbscrew fell into unit. Called company twice , once 3 weeks ago. They said they would call me back, but never did. Debating whether to return, but it is such a pain. Company finally responded to emails wit ""Parts not available"". This was on speakers they delivered in last 3 weeks. I will take Pyle off my list of ordered products!"
3,A nameless creature arrives at a Victorian household.,"This book is very light compared to most Edward Goreys. The creature is so funny, especialy when he puts on that innocent look that my dog puts on when she's down something bad. The family pretends to want to get rid of this animal while they really probally like the change from their boring, Victorian lives. I treasure this book as much as a picture I have of Edward Gorey with a Doubtful Guest stuffed animal."
5,Great album,"This album is a good R&B album. A few titles are great, almost classics: Been Around The World and Summertime. It's too bad that there's no sequel."
1,"Been there, done that, bought the T-shirt","My problem with this book is that it tells you (rightfully so) that diets are no solution and then it proceeds to outline a diet you need to follow for the rest of your life. It didn't give me much more information than is available from other books, like Oprah's book ""Make the Connection"" and Barry Sear's ""The Zone"", although it does give some interesting info. explaining how stress physically affects appetite and why it's easy to gain weight and hard to lose it the older a woman gets. But as far as HOW to lose it, it's pretty much the same old story: eat less and exercise more, for the rest of your life, with a lot of cutesy-pie jargon thrown in to fool you that there's much that's new in what the author is saying."
3,Well . . .,"As far as vocals go, Geoff Tate never sounded as on top of his game as he does here--I've played this for several friends who study voice, and they're all impressed. However, the songs themselves, with the exception of ""Take Hold Of The Flame"" and ""Roads To Madness"", all smack of mediocre Iron Maiden, albeit with slightly more intelligent lyrics. Also, as excellent as Geoff sounds, after a while listeners will develop Mariah Carey Syndrome, which is when you want to yell ""Okay, you're a great singer, now SHUT UP!"" (although I would take Geoff over Mariah any day, mind you . . .)"
5,Full Force Rock,"The promise of their self titled EP is brought to full force on Queensryche's first full length album. This has some incredibly powerful rock, ""En Force"", ""N M 156"", and ""Child of Fire"". Every song on this album, but especially ""Roads to Madness"" show the development of the bands writing ability. They are starting to show their ability to strike chords of emotion through the listener. I just wish it was easier to read the song titles on the CD cover, but that's a minor complaint about an exceptional album."
2,Great product-- for a little while,"This was my second Nomad Jukebox, and I should have learned after the first one. The first was a 10GB player that I bought in June of 03. It lasted EXACTLY 6 months before freezing up on me. No amount of tech support would bring it back to life. I said, well, I guess i will just spend the extra cash and get an ipod.The low price of the Nomad 30GB seduced me. I picked one up instead of the pod, and I loved it, for about 6 months. Then the headphone jack stopped working. Luckily, this time I got the service plan, so when my refund check arrives, I am off to buy... an Ipod."
1,Was great while it lasted...,"Hard drive failed after 7 months. Warranty lasts for 3 months. Loved it, now I hate it."
2,No accessories,"It works fine, I can't compare it to the ipod but I'm very disappointed in the lack of accessories available.I would like to find a car adapter so I can listen to it in the car longer than the short time the battery lasts. I have found nothing available! Amazon lists it as discontinued and when I called Creative, they told me it was discontinued and they have no idea when a new one will be available. There is no cradle available either. Go into a store like Best Buy and you'll see a wide variety of accessories available for ipod.Ipod cost more but I'm very sorry I didn't buy one now since it seems that Creative is doing nothing to make accessories availably."
3,"Hard Drive Fails, but at least it's replaceable","I bought the Jukebox Zen Xtra in December 2003. It worked really well on a long trip to Australia (which is why we bought it.) Yes, the software that comes with it is pretty crappy but Notmad from RedChair software works really well and is worth the investment of a few extra bucks.Then one day I was sitting at work and the hard drive completely failed. I hadn't taken it jogging, or used it outside a controlled area, it was not dropped or anything.The good thing is that once this happened, I just bought a new (and larger!) hard drive and dropped it in. It works perfectly and I have double the disk space. You can't do that with an iPod.I'm not happy that it failed, but I am happy that it was so easy to fix myself, and I'm glad I didn't spend all that money for an iPod which would potentially fail the same way."
4,The best birthday present I've ever gotten!,"When I asked my husband to get me a small MP3 player for my birthday so I could listen to music while doing cleaning and walking, I had no idea he'd buy me such an expensive and wonderful model. I never owned an MP3 player before, so I was a bit intimidated to say the least. The little bitty earphones they come with just don't work for me, so I use Sony headphones with an extra long cord. The ""holder"" for it isn't the best either, but at least it protects the screen from being scratched or damaged. The one major thing I didn't like about this was the non-existence of a paper manual. I'd much rather have a paper manual to look at while I'm working with something than to have to go back and forth on computer screens. I suppose you could print the pages you need....So... if you buy another set of headphones, think the holder is OK, and don't mind online manuals.. this is a great product."
5,Creative Nomad Jukebox 30gb zen,I've had my Creative Jukebox for over 1 year and have so far had no problems with it and the review that says you can't use the Janus thing from some services might be true but you can get around that by transferring the music to your computer and then transferring to the creative.I haven't had any freeze up problems with my unit so far but I think all ipod devices freeze at some point.I've even heard about people reporting that apple ipods occassionally freeze up.The only negatives I've found with the creative jukebox is the battery life isn't that long between charges and you can't transfer video from your computer to your creative zen.I've got some game trailers on my computer that won't go to my zen it's just for music.The big plus in this product is the much cheaper price than apple and the battery is replacable.I highly recommend it.
4,A better alternative to Apple IPod,"This unit is great. I wanted the features of an Ipod without the very expensive cost of one and the Creative Zen delivers. The unit requires about 15 minutes of reading to learn how to use it. The user replacible battery is a good idea. The Creative software needs a little updating though, it's not as smooth as I thought it waould be for downloading music from your library to your zen. But aside from that it really is an Ipod killer."
1,Buy Sony and RCA's digital music players instead,"This is a good music player and looks pretty nice.It is overadvertised and everyone has one so its not even unique. There are many better players at comparable prices with 20GB or greater harddrive.There are many accesseries you have to buy for it which you'd get free with other mp3 players(SONY Walkman digital music player and my favorite the RCA jukebox and video player)It holds less songs than Sony's(Sony-13,000)You can't watch movies in color on a 3.5inch flatscreen(you can on RCA's)Accesaries not includedCase-$20-$45(included with Sony's and RCA's)USB cable-$30(included with Sony's and RCA's)No free songs(30 free with Sony's Walkman digital music player)Dock $40(included with Sony's and RCA's)"
1,Won't turn on,"One day it just stopped playing in the middle of a song, only six months after purchase and used very little. Nothing Creative says will help fix it and of course I'm out of luck, big waste of money...don't buy this you have been warned!"
2,Three Words: Do Not Buy!!!,"Do not get me wrong, Don Mclean can make an incredible song. American Pie is, in fact, my favorite song of all time. It is fantastic, a timeless masterpiece. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for his album bearing the same name. First off, the album version of American Pie is not the 8-minute version. Instead, it is 2 minutes. This is an outrage, without the full length, the song loses all of its magic. Also, just about every other song is awful. I read reviews of the album and many have said that Vincent is just as good as American Pie. I strongly dissagree. Vincent is possibly my least favorite song of Don's. The lyrics make a great poem, but a [bad] song. So, if you like American Pie, just download it, just dont waste your money on this cd."
2,Cardboard Case?,"The music is as good as I remember on the vinyl, but the cardboard container (no plastic at all) is getting too cheap."
2,Bummer,After hearing the radio friendly hit off this album the rest just kind of goes a little flat. I got it for my girl friend & she's not that impressed with it. Oh well better luck next time?
3,Sequel to Celestine Prophecy,"The philosphocial insights and revelations are the meat of this story and each revelation is looked forward to. For example learning about the The Goddess Isis, the deep secret of the Medallion, perspective of history in ancient Egypt etc. Unfornately, the so-called adventure story gets in the way. The characters that speak to Jason are poorly developed and redundant. However, on the whole, it is a clever way to mix fact and fiction. (Which is which?)"
2,Hopelessly out of date,"My review concerns the 4-th edition of the book published in 2003. I found that some (much) information in the book is no longer correct. Some hotels mentioned in the book do not any longer exist, many emails of tour operators do not exist, time schedules are not correct; where the book mentions 'a good restaurant' at the hotel it turns out that the restaurant is not there since 2002. And all this I discovered during only 2 weeks traveling... Things change fast in Venezuela. The book can be used for general info and to get some clues what you want to visit (therefore I gave the book 2 stars, but only for that) but it's much better to query Internet for this purpose. The book also lacks some very important practical info as for example where to change money on the black market - the only way to get Bolivars (official rate is far too low).The point is the book does contain some information on the country but as travel guide it is almost useless. I cannot recommend this edition."
2,an axe to grind?,"Gutman undertakes the enormous task of writing a Wagner biography and he uses Wagner's ethnic background, biases, and racial views (such as anti-semitism) as weapons against the composer. What I found interesting and even titillating in this accusation of bias on the part of Wagner is the fact that Gutman, who tells us that he was born in New York City of German-speaking parents, does NOT tell us his own ethnic background. His silence on this issue in the midst of so many trivial aspects of a writer's preparation and credentials is highly suspicious. The reader is thus left to wonder if the book was written by an unbiased mind."
4,a potpourri of nature crafts,"interesting craft book. Has several different sections regarding various natural materials. Shells, feathers, leaves, pods, etc. This books is basically about different home decor items with a ""natural"" slant. You find your standard wreaths, flower pots, frames, topiaries, etc-but shows how to cover them with various natural materials.The projects all look top quality-you'd be happy to display as home decor without worrying if they looked ""hokey""-but all these projects have been covered in many other craft books over the years-nothing seemed new or innovative. The directions are BASIC-pretty much written with few step by step instructions-a novice crafter may not understand the directions.Overall, beautiful ""eye candy"" for seasoned crafters looking for inspiration for ""flower arrangement"" type crafts. I'd suggest you buy used.3.5 stars."
3,Beach Boys Endless Summer MP3 album,"The MP3 downloaded quickly and plays fine; I had no sound or quality issues. As for the music itself, what can I say: its the Beach Boys. The music is pleasant, classic Beach Boys."
5,Great Title for a Writer Still Getting His Feet Wet,"I'm a sucker for writing advice / how-to's, and this book not only does that, but greatly exceeds my expectations. Swain writes very clear copy aimed at all levels of writers and I believe that anyone will find at least a few new or interesting things in each chapter.The whole concept of Motivation-Reaction Units is unique and while it seemed kind of odd at first, now makes a whole lot of sense. And Swain makes sure the reader knows this methodology is merely a tool, not the end all be all of writing good copy.I think this is a book I will keep close to my writing desk and reference on a regular basis."
5,It fits,I was worried about the fit. It does fit small diameter wrists. The weight is very comfortable. The leather band feels comfortable. I really like the look but time will tell if it stays new looking. The coolest watch I have ever had.
2,Such a boring and depressing book!,"Ms. Chance has always been one of my favorite authors; have at least 2 of her books as keepers in my personal collection. This is the first book of hers that I didn't like at all! It's too slow and sad a book, didn't really have much to say, and I really disliked the heroine. And, Ms. Chance, where's the romance? the love scenes? I'm not sure how the heroine ends up with her answers, by the end of the book. Ms. Chance has never been a writer of sensual romance; but she writes a good love scene--when she writes them. I just can't think of anything positive to say about this book; and I wish I could."
5,COD Cash on Demand,Never will you go wrong with Johnny. this is a solid performance and a must for any collection
2,bad concert at the Montreux,I seems that alot of music DVD's filmed at the Montreux are not that good. I wish I could give this DVD more stars but I can't. I like to keep my reviews short so I agree with alot of the other reviews and say that the sound was bad but the picture was really bad too. I would have loved to seen a great concert by Johnny Cash.
3,Not for the faint of mind!,"This is a very Difficult read. It attempts to set forth a conprehensive method of thinking about faith. It shows from various angles how faith is thought of and attempts to dissolve the atheistic mindset to a certain degree. However, if I was looking for a treatment of evidence for the existence of God or even further the existence of the God presented in the bible I did not find it here. What i got was a basic understanding that Atheism's claim that God does not exist was not reasonable and that Theism should not be thought of as unreasonable. There was no distinct, clear, statement showing that God oes indeed exist but there was quite a bit of speculative thought throughout the book. It shows one different ways of thinking through faith but does not do justice in validating the Christian Faith."
2,Not what I was expecting,This book is a digest of the major topics in the current study of philosophy of religion as it applies to christian theology. It contains no original source materials and is definitely written from a particular point of view rather than attempting to make an objective presentation of the topics at hand. This would probably be a fine companion to another of the philosophy of religion books that are collections of original sources but this book is certainly not adequate to cover the field by itself.
4,Only For a Important Matter...,"The book was really intriguing. As I began to read it I first felt that the author was beginning to be like overly dramatically vivid with metaphors and special syntax within the reading; but, however the reading wasn't that bad I thought theories and philosophical arguments where unique and yet questionable. I thought the author was pretty direct and amusing when trying to actually explain a philosopher theories and arguments in laymen terms. The humor comes from my thought of how humans reasoning and logic thinking process works. In the reading the subject of: theories of God's existence, had a agreeable explanation of Teleological Theory beliefs, I find this most rational reason for God's existence. Also the the Theories of Revelation is a interesting reading too. I view God and religion in a non-propositional view . But overall the reading was good, Enjoyed it !!!"
1,Oh Man!!!!!!!,"This band really sucks. It was cheesy in the 80's and now it's totally comedic listening to the horrible lyrics of Bret Micheals. C.C. Deville is a LOUSY guitar player, I can't believe people actually think he's good. Then there's Rikki Rocket, just the stupidity of his name tells you the extent of his talent. Poison was big in the 80's because record companies had alot of money back then and they were signing ANYBODY that dressed up in spandex and grew their hair long, then moussed it till it stood 10 feet high!!!I suggest if you own this, hide it in your closet before someone comes over and actually see's it in your collection"
1,not even good in an ironic sense,This album is total garbage. I would say the only people who like this stuff are beer drinking old dudes with mullets. The cover of the album has to be the worst cover of any album ever. Hilarious!
3,well researched but thoroughly biased,"Mr Preston writes a thorough, albeit completely biased account of Franco. I expectd to read a book that measured Franco on balance, especially in view of the irrevocable political antagonisms that characterized Spain in the early 20th century. Unfortunately, Preston seems bent on ruthlessly attacking not only every aspect of the man's public record but also weakly constructing a sort of psychological profile to explain the General's every move. Interestingly, the more I read the book the more I gained a healthy respect for dictator and the role he played in setting the stage for the resurgence of democratic Spain after his death."
4,portrait of a dictator,"Preston's account is the classic biography of the century's longest-lasting dictator. His largest contribution is giving a description of Franco's character while not exonerating him from the atrocities he committed. It gives a vivid portrait of his transition from a ""self-styled el Cid"" to a tottering old man who could barely walk at the end of his life. His account is well-balanced and is quality reading for anyone who wishes to gain an overall perspective of Franco's character.."
5,The definitive work,"Written from a moderate-left viewpoint, this book is likely the last important biography of Franco. Yes, the author obviously dislikes his subject; but no one can accuse Preston of being less than the consummate historian. Other reviewers have complained about bias. (Regarding a previous review: the family tales that ""contradict"" Preston's command of the facts are merely anecdotes.) It is impossible to write about Franco and the end of the Spanish Republic without providing an interpretation. Given the events, the interpretations are likely to be rather polarized. One last point: this book is for those who already have an interest in the subject and who want to explore all the dark corners of Francoism and the man himself."
2,"Dry, but informative","A very complete look at the life and times of one of this century's longest-lasting dictators, with both the pro and con of Fransisco Franco discussed. The problem is that the dry tone of a biography is the rule here with almost no exceptions. Unless you're truly interested in dictators or Spanish history, stay away."
4,Definitely worth the price,"I love these little speakers--they are very compact, and despite being so small, they actually have bass! The only flaws I can see with these speakers is that the volume level seems to reset itself every time I unplug them, which means I have to turn up the volume every time I use them--kind of a pain (this may not be a problem if you use them with batteries). Also, the carrying bag that they come with is not big enough to hold the power adapter along with the speakers. Minor issues, though. I'm definitely happy with the product."
2,Garbage,"I'm not sure if ours was defective or if they're all this horrible. When you turn it off you can still hear buzzing from the speakers and your batteries are being drained. Took us about 12 dollars in batteries until we realized that. Bass sounds fuzzy even when running off of the AC adapter. We've had a few hours of decent listening time, but otherwise it has been nothing but an annoyance."
2,What a joke!,"Sound quality not at all what I expected. Looks good, performs badly. Doesn't really fit my iPod Nano, I am so disappointed.... but then again, how could I expect Bose quality for such a small price? My mistake, you get what you pay for. I'll probably donate it to the Salvation Army."
2,Poorer quality than past product,I received the Cheers red wine glasses as a gift a few years back and LOVE them. I finally realized I want the complete set and asked for the white wine glasses as a gift also. Unfortunately since they were purchased a few years apart they seem to be made differently. The red wine glasses have the designs etched into the glass. The white wine glasses look more cheaply made and it seems like the design is almost painted on. Definitely disappointing based on what I was expecting - a comparable product from the same company.
3,Looks good,"The movie looks good. Beautiful people hired as actors. I found the story a bit contrived. Also Tyrone Power character dumb as could possibly be. Still the settings were great, and the story works on dream level."
3,Satisfying historical drama,"Fans of Tyrone Power should enjoy this costume drama, in which he plays a downtrodden hero determined to best villain Sanders (in his best sleekly nasty mode). A very young Roddy McDowall plays Power in his youth. As a follower of Gene Tierney, I was disappointed by her character--a lovely native girl who looks good in a sarong but speaks no English; she seems to function only as a foil for the classy but cold Farmer. However, the classic plot of the underdog who triumphs over his oppressors has strong appeal, and there's a great showdown between Power and Sanders."
3,ok product,I bought several candle making books when I bought this. The durability of this book is better than the others. But the information in this book is limited greatly compared to the others.
4,Review of Gulf Run,"Spinner and Haft have managed to survive so far against steep odds and in the process are forced to take on much more responsibility than either of them ever wanted, especiallly Haft. It leaves the reader with some unanswered questions and has a tendancy to allow the women characters to take on an 'only better', female stand point (i.e. women are as good as men only they can be better whenever they put their minds to it). While generally this type of thinking can't start croppingup until the great equalizer (gunpowder and guns) rears its ugly head in widespread use, this is a magical realm so anything is possible.On the whole this is a good book with alot of combat and action for those of us who like battle sequences. I recommed this book. This book isn't perfect, but I am eagerly awating the next book in the series. Even though the men are hen pecked more than men of thier social era should allow."
5,Great Series - to bad this is it.,"I have read all three and have been wating for the 4th, no I find out that the series has been halted do to lack of sale. The series is a good mixture between battles and human nature with a touch of fantasy mixed in. You get to know the main characters and they stay true throughout the series."
5,Who's Gonna Sing,"I am sure most people pay attention to this album because they are Morphine fans. But the irony is that you are gona like this album if you are not expecting another Morphine album. The drum beats and sax are as sedating as ever before. Yet, through out the entire album, you feel like there is something missing. You cannot hear the familiar sliding bass and that beautiful voice. No one in the world rocks like Mark Sandman does. With that being said, folks, this one is as close to the old Morphine as you can get. Although I don't really care too much about the singer (she is good but not as original), the rest of the stuff is still brilliant.The last song was definitely wrote for Mark. ""What if I wake up, and the music stops playing ..... Wish somebody were singing ..... Who's gonna sing? We're all gonna sing ....."" Surely, someone will be missed forever, but we all have to move on."
5,THE GREATEST OF ALL TIME.,NATALIE COLE GREATEST HITS MADE HER MY CHILDHOOD IDIOL. I ALWAYS THOUGHT SHE WAS VERY TALENTED AND PRETTY. I MEMORIZE HER ALBUM CALLED THANKFUL AT THE AGE OF EIGHT. I HAVE FOLLOWED HER CAREER ALL MY LIFE. SHE IS MY INSPIRATION AS I WATCHED HER OVERCOME DRUGS AND COME BACK ON THE SEEN IN FULL AFFECT.
2,Lacks Creativity,"This is one of those Bunny Lee DUB CDs that, in my humble opinion, border on boring, displaying none of the shining creativity that, say, the great Lee Scratch Perry shows on many of his dub CDs. The dubs on this CD just lie there, no spark. Save your hard-earned cash on this one."
4,Not deep enough but beautiful case!,"The case is very beautiful,the interior is velvet and makes the whole case look very nice, but the only thing that dissapointed me was the fact that the ring spaces are wide enough but not deep enough. My rings kept popping up. Other than that the case its beautiful!"
2,Did not like the book really,"As a Bilingual teacher, I believe immigrant children should learn the basics of schooling in their home language; that way, they will be able to communicate with their parents, and they will earn self confidence. This book shows the lack of communication and self-esteem immigrant children are suffering from, in the United States."
5,I had similar experiences,I'm also Mexican-American and went through similar experiences as the author of this book. I was also the only Mexican student in my classroom at the elementary school that I attended all 8 years.
4,Hunger of Memory was a very helpful and interesting book.,Matt Zepeda English 155 Comp. # 61110 10-01-98I found the book Hunger of Memory by Richard Ridriguez to be very interesting. Experiences in his life that he talks about in his book helped me to understand situations in my life. Some people may not find this book interesting but its only because they probably can not relate to it. Since I could relate to Rodriguez I found the book to be a great asset to me.
3,"Unstoppable, Mean, and Deeply Disturbed","Sheriff Dan Stevens (Chuck Norris) is matched against an unstoppable killer that is determined to tear him apart and leave his body in little pieces. The killer is John Kirby, who loses his power to speak after death. The movie would have been much better if it had been his ex-wife who had died and then brought back to go after Norris. Unstoppable, mean and deeply disturbed, it would have been far more realistic, but ex-wives aren't silent, so it probably wouldn't have worked.This movie shows off Norris' fighting ability and one wonders how Kirby enjoyed having the holy snot beaten out of him every day of filming. But that's what stunt men are for, right?I haven't seen the movie in years, but I'm going to get it for old time's sake. It's an obvious rip-off of the 1956 movie, The Indestructible Man, which had no karate."
3,"It's Chuck Norris v The Bogeyman, guess who wins?","Who better to test an invincibilty formula on than a crazy sick lunatic? Well...if cinematic scientist's ever learn not to boldly tread where they are not supposed to then we wouldn't get movies like this. I know, some would argue that that's a GOOD thing.Regardless of its silly and contrived plot, Silent Rage does have moments of genuine suspense and a few well done action scenes. Norris, though still really wooden at this point in his 'acting' career, remains a likable enough screen persona. This horror/action hybrid may not work well as a whole, but it has enough character to it to make it worth checking out for those who like b-movies."
2,2 out of 5 stars for the 2/5s of the book that were helpful,"As a girl brand new to the Air Force with my soon-to-be husband deployed, I found myself all alone in Utah in our big empty house, waiting months for his return. So I bought this book.In the beginning, Kay offers encouragement and advice for families dealing with deployments and the regular career surprises that we should all expect. But the latter half of the book is like an on-going commercial for her other books about how to cut coupons and comb garage sales with seven kids. She also includes way too many personal stories for her ""hero profiles."" It's almost as if she got out her good ideas in the first 40 pages, and scrambled for random material for the rest.The whole book seemed thrown together. There were even one or two typos and grammatical errors that were quite distracting. I've yet to find a book that gave good advice for a military spouse without talking down to the reader."
1,Don't Waste Your Money On This Product. It Doese Not Work.,This product is a waste of time & money. ALCiS did not work me. It just laid there and did nothing when it comes to pain. A heating pad works better than ALCiS.
4,"Very smart device, software a little clunky","The logic built into the monitor is very reliable and intelligent. The build quality is very good, battery life is great. In general, a great purchase. The PC interface works pretty well, although the software is a little clunky and non-standard."
4,Nice Dipset Movement!,"Never been a big fan of NY rap,but with Dipset i cant help but become more of a fan of the Ny rap scene.Jimmy comes nice on some and fiya as hell on others. best songs are Ballin,Reppin Time,Weatherman,Pour Wax, Get it Poppin!"
1,One word: Horrible,"i think this was a horrible cd. wish i didnt waste money on it. his last one was better than this one. i like maybe 2-3 tracks on this whole thing. i think max b ruined it, if you ask me. i wanted the cd for emotionless. oh yea and jim is fine!!"
4,Does what its supposed to...,"This is nice to have for peace of mind on a really rainy day when on the hwy... I don't have to worry about traffic mist from soaking my CAI filter.. but I do notice the slightest bit of loss in performance with the added air restriction, and its a real good fit, so it's a bear to get on. Does what its intended."
4,"Very easy to read, I recommend it.","I took this test as the second of four on the way to my CCNP. I used only this book and a couple of routers in a lab to pass this test. Well, that and a few years experience.This book is well written, and is easy to read. The examples are good, and it convered everything that was on the test. I couldnt ask for more!"
1,Save your money,"I am a Cisco instructor at one of the colleges in Dallas. It is a known fact that there is no single book , which covers the subject both thorough and in an easy to read manner. Every Remote Access book has its cons and pros. BUT why would you buy the worst study guide? I recommend to my students to start with McGraw Hill's BCRAN (very easy and clear explanation) and then use Cisco's Remote Access (more detailed and very good labs, but boring to read) or Remote Access for Cisco Networks by Bill Burton (which is an exellent source, but lacks some basic info) If your goal is to become a good network specialist (not just paper certified), try to avoid Sybex's guides. I can make one exception for CCNA book, because of good labs and router simulator software."
5,"Definitely ""Off The Chain""",Euftis is quickly becoming my favorite erotic author. I've read both books three times each. His stories get me very excited and keeps me thoroughly satisfied. I appreciate his unique way of telling his true stories. Euftis gets your imagination going and gives you ideas for your partners. The sex scenes are hot and Euftis is hotter!!! I'd love to read a volume 3.I'm waiting E...........
1,what an insipid female!!,"I disliked this book and I only picked it up because I like Regencies and of course the reviews here. The female character (definitely not a heroine!) was so weak, and everything I detest in female characters in this genre. Yes she was a victim but the annoying thing was how she went tamely to whatever fate life dealt her. She did everything your mummy told you NOT to do when 'boys talk to you'.Ewen, the male character saved this book for me, just for a while. Unfortunately it was NOT enough. I eventually found him too suave and world-wise for the lead female who constantly came off as she was in way over her head with no backbone. EVERYTHING was decided for her and such a big deal made over her scar.....yes scars are the worst thing to happen!She never questioned, never probed just accepted what he told her. How realistic is that? Just Yuck......this book was never finished."
5,Great value!,"Alder chips are almost impossible to find at a supermarket or large hardware store such as Home Depot or Lowes. These chips do indeed complement salmon very well. The flavor is more mild than hickory, mesquite, oak, pecan, maple or any of the fruit woods. The giant 8 pound bag will last for a couple of grilling seasons, and makes it easy to offer some to guests, if they enjoy the flavor. This is a great product, would recommend to anyone who enjoys a smoky flavor, but on the mild side."
4,dj unk,"My students like this music so I had to check it out. It had the promised ""walk it out"" and 3 others that I really enjoyed. I'm new to the music and I bet after more time I'd like it all. Good album, clean version which I like, thanks for expanding my listening."
4,Paul McCartney's first album,"""McCartney"", Paul McCartney's first album after the breakup of the Beatles, is a glimpse in time of this talented, enduring musician. Post-Beatles, pre-Wings, this album is a sort of personal memoir. McCartney wrote, produced, and performed the entire album in his home studio, before the age of synthesizers and digital effects. The results are sometimes uneven but sometimes brilliant. More than thirty-five years later he still gets mileage out of the classic ""Maybe I'm Amazed"" and Phoebe Snow, among others, have made successful covers of ""Every Night."" As much as anything, though, the album displays McCartney's seemingly endless ability to craft catchy tunes. ""McCartney"" is a pleasant romp through the meandering musical musings of the album's namesake."
2,"Take off the Macca colored glasses, folks..","For the most part, this is crap. It contains a few good songs, but honestly, these are just fragments that he threw together. I love and admire Paul. He is a genius that can make great records when he wants. Let's hope he is serious on the next release, as he was with ""Chaos and Creation."""
4,Great start,"Pauls songs with the Beatles are the best, but his solo career is rally good two starting with this album. GodBless"
1,Deluxe Editions gone WILD.,"So many deluxe editions popping up...and hardly any are worth the money. Paul's debut album was fairly good...but certainly not deserving of the ""deluxe"" treatment given here. You'd think that Paul already has enough money and wouldn't feel the need to delve into his fans' bank accounts during these hard times. A deluxe edition of Ram might be better than this...who knows?"
5,Great,"There are many basic beading techniques shown with good, detailed instructions, making it easy to incorporate into a quilt right away."
2,Missing in action,"One of the best obscure tracks George Harrison ever recorded was ""Deep Blue,"" the B-side to the ""Bangla Desh"" single. A great little song, but try finding it anywhere today on CD !!! And yet it is truly one of George's best. Also, since George's solo career was very short (1970 - 1982 really), an updated CD should be released with ""Deep Blue,"" ""All Those Years Ago,"" ""Crackerbox Palace,"" and maybe one of the chants from ""Chant & Be Happy."""
4,Stop,"Wow, i've read some real stuffy overblown reviews of this cd right here. For the most part i have grown immune to the Beatles as they are and have been played for years. I am still stunned by the classics and I give both McCartney and Lennon all they are due. Harrison seemed to be always a sideshow. If i purchased this cd it was for one hit, ""You""! I could care less about the criticism of the simple melody and i could care less about all this analysis from people who really dont ""get"" music and the artists simple translations of thought to music and lyrics. ""You"" says something to me about somebody I knew once and still know, it's to the point and it means alot to me, really simple. Alot of other Harrison standards are on the disc too. Get off your high horse, drop the cash and pick it up, seeing that George is taking a dirt nap right now im sure he'd appreciate.it."
3,The Town on the Hassayampa,"I thought that as far as history books go, it was a good book. It is a fairly easy book to read. The only relatively hard part would be the namses of the Native American tribes in the area of Wickenburg. This however should not impede on anyone that is remotely familiar with Arizona history however. There were some points that seemed to drag in the book however, but the histories of all the towns in America can't be action packed I guess. Mr. Pry included some very intersting pictures in his book that were worth taking another look at."
5,"One of my ""Desert Island"" CD's...","I've owned the 9 1/2 Weeks Soundtrack on tape three times and twice on CD. Simply, it's a great CD. There are three ""classics"": Slave to Love, I Do What I do, and You Can Leave Your Hat On, but those are just the tip of the iceberg.Buy it and enjoy it!Other CD's I would need to have with me -- if I was deserted on an island, of course:Roxy Music -- AvalonStyle Council -- The Singular Adventures of the Style CouncilDepeche Mode -- Catching Up WIth...Duran Duran -- Duran Duran (First), but would take just about any of them."
5,"""Paul Weller is a Muscial God""","I will keep this short,simple, and to the point. Heliocentric is the best out of the Paul Weller solo collection(besides WildWood). It is so melodic and passionate. Paul's music takes away all your problems and mellows you out.He is hands down one of the best musicians you well ever hear. BUY IT you will not be dissapointed.His music can be described as waking up on a beutiful sunny morning,birds chirping and the Tah Mahal is built in your back yard. Paul Weller is a musical GOD!"
2,Weller's latest is a little weak!,"I am a long time Weller fan, and I have to say that this is not his best work. I love Wildwood and Heavy Soul as well as a lot of the Style Council work, but this CD was not my cup of tea.I am however a completist so I had to have it. If this is your reason go ahead and order it, if you don't yet own Heavy Soul get that release before this. Hope I was helpful."
2,"ok, nothing great.","Of course, this book is dated. It is ok, nothing great.If you want the best book on the subject, get Dameon Welch-Abernathy's fw-1 title.That's a really good book."
5,Wow!,"Ok, at first I was like Zi-who? Then I put this joint in my car, I found myself trying to let go of the past (one of the tracks on the album). I love these ladies."
5,Read this book if you are interested in VFP and the NET,"Mr. Strahl explains everything you need to know to put your VFP applications on the internet. The INet technologies are not left as some kind of magic, but rather are explained clearly and susinctly. A must have book."
5,No woman is a great I love it I love it,Great remake of the Four Tops Aint no woman the raggae flavor gives it a nice and interesting twist. Love it very much
4,Chilling,"The past is always romanticized. Money, intelligence and Position are always envied. BUT READ and BEWARE ! Evil comes in every shape and package - ""Rights"" were not always what they are today. And even the brightest Star can fall victim.I am not a fan of James' style at all...too much naration and thirty words when three would suffice.Still, the theme of the book is solid and leaves lessons that should not be forgotten. Not that we need to be protected from ever making a mistake or misjudgement.....but once our eyes are opened.....please allow us to recoup our dignity.""The good old days weren't all that good, and tomorrow's not a bad as it seems"" Billy Joel(90% in (a Kindle you know) I am hoping to see a little of Scarlett O'Hara in our heroine....I think I hope in vain. Perhaps I should put down the book now and hold to my hopes.)"
4,"nice knives, just one problem","I owned an 8"" wusthof che's knife and it was the best knife I've even owned. I got this block as a Christmas present and was very disappointed that the quality and weight of the chef's knife was not what I was used to. Overall very good, but not Wusthof's highest quality."
5,Better than anticipated,"I needed to cover 10 lights on a roof rack on a Rubicon I recently purchased. I chose the vinyl covers because I hoped they would stay attached better.They arrived quickly, well packed and just as described. The seller was easy to contact when I had questions. I would go out of my way to buy from them again.The product was easy to slip on, even with my old arthritic hands, and has stayed on through gale winds here in the high desert. I have the black vinyl with red lettering on my black Jeep. They look great."
4,Optigonally yours instead of Prozac,"Sweet and silly and reminicent of a few past musical trends, and still frightenly original. Can't listen to it without getting happy,and trying to figure out what it reminds you of makes your brain itch, but in a good way."
4,Proper debut,"Hirai Ken's debut album is a good starting point for an artist whose career already spans ten years and have sold more than 2 million copies of his greatest hits package in Japan only.Un-Balanced showcases Ken's decent vocals which would improve greatly over the years and marks the beginning of an amazing artist.Highlights: Precious Junk, Katahou zutsu no Earphone and Egao"
5,Period Instruments,"Music's Re-creation, a period-instrument ensemble consisting of Louise Carslake, flute, Carla Moore, violin, John Dornenburg, viola da gamba, and Lorna Peters, harpsichord, perform the six concertos for flute from the ""Six Concertos and Six Suites"" of 1734 by Georg Philipp Telemann (1681-1767).The works on this recording:1. Concerto No.1 in D major, TWV 42:D62. Concerto No.2 in G minor, TWV 42:g23. Concerto No.3 in A major, TWV 42:A34. Concerto No.4 in E minor, TWV 42:e35. Concerto No.5 in B minor, TWV 42:h16: Concerto No.6 in A minor, TWV 42:a2"
1,blank page,"only a blank page came up, no text, very disapointing. then found it impossible to find somewhere on the amazon site that would let me teturn or complain about the malfunction"
4,Memoirs of a Geisha,"I really enjoyed this movie. I thought is was very well done and it kept my interest. I don't think my husband enjoyed it as much as I did, so I guess it was more of a chick flick."
3,"If you read the book first, don't bother!","If you read the book first, you will probably be let down by the movie. Very few movies adapt a novel successfully, and this one falls way short of the mark. The characters in the novel are so extra-ordinarily fleshed out, while the movie versions are like paper cut-outs in comparison. Obviously, much had to be edited out to fit in the 2 and a half hours, but the editing is much too choppy. If you havn't read the book, it can be a bit confusing. Of course, if you have read the book, you can fill in the numerous blank spaces, but the experience is somewhat of a let down.Final though: If you haven't read the book, go ahead and see the movie first. If you like it, the book is a hundred times better. It is destined to be a classic in its own right (the book, that is)."
2,Warning! Quintessential Chick Flick,"Wonderfully cast, beautifully filmed, and exquisitely scored but with the emotional depth and instincts of a Mexican soap opera.Seldom do so many excellent qualities converge to produce such a boring, essentially insipid film.There is a superficial pass at what it takes to become a geisha, how girls of the poor were essentially sold into bondage, pre-war Tokyo, the effect of World War Two etc., but the real weight of the film is thrown behind the emotional travails of the heroine, her unrequited love, her aguish, her this, her that, ad nausea.Bleh!"
1,Memoirs of a Geisha DVD Review,"Sucks! This movie cuts all the good stuff out. Don't buy it. Save you money & buy the book or the book on audio (itunes or audio books) instead. The best story I ever heard. Loved the book. I laugh, cheered, & cried. A must have book. Not the Movie."
2,Waste of Talent,"This film should have much to recommend it. The cinematography and art direction are outstanding. From a purely visual point of view, this is a stunning film. The direction and acting are also quite good, with all performances at least very good, and some, notably those of the estimable Ken Watanabe, Gong Li, and Michelle Yeoh, excellent. All this talent, however, is used in the service of a trivial romance novel plot. The latter is essentially poor girl falls in love with powerful, noble, and good looking man, survives numerous tribulations and ends up with the man of her dreams. This stupid cliche undermines completely the all the positive aspects of this movie."
5,Wonderful movie!,"I have seen hundreds of movies and this one is very unique. It deals with the complex a complex occupation though it is stated that these are fictional accounts.Its heartfelt, warm, artsy and refreshing when compared to a western lifestyle."
3,"Beautifully filmed, Engaging story.","11 Behind the Scenes Featurettes including: The Look of a Geisha (inside the wardrobe and make-up), The Music of the Film, Geisha Bookcamp (see how the actresses became geishas), A Geisha's Dance and more! Director Rob Marshall and Co-Producer John DeLuca Audio CommentaryLanguages: English 5.1, French 5.1 (Dolby Digital)Subtitles: English, French"
3,Too Hollywood and commercial,"I know that in the past the Japanese girls were sold to Geisha houses, I don't know if this is still the norm or not. The costumes were beautiful, the acting was fine, some of the scenery was breathtaking. But, something was missing ,I think it was the Japanese touch. It just seemed much too Hollywood and not enough Japan. Something was lost in translation, for me anyway. Enjoy!"
4,My DVD was a surprise,"I thought I ordered a new DVD of this movie but got two surprises 1) Disc 1 started to pause itself and I don't even know if that was the end of the movie. I put in Disk 2 only to find Featurettes? I thought the movie was going to continue! The 2nd DVD also has deep scratches on it!!As for the part I did see - I really liked this movie, but of course I liked the book much better. The colors in this movie were awesome!I would have picked different actresses to play Chiyo and Hatsumo(can't remember her name). In the book for some reason I assumed all the girls were a bit closer in age. Oh well."
3,"Pretty, but that's all","Memoirs of a Geisha is a pretty movie. Gorgeous, even.But that's really all it is. The plot isn't terribly engaging, the characters who aren't loathsome are fairly uninteresting and the movie feels two or three times as long as it really is.This is a rental, nothing more."
5,loved it!,I watched this movie YEARS ago and I just recently picked up reading again the past year and read the book. It was soo good that I had to buy the movie to watch it also! reading the book is 100% recommended. Movie is just beautiful.
5,excellent..breathtaking!!!!,this movie was a great experience....im a 25 yr old guy too....film should win many oscars...got some mixed reviews but i dont see why....go see it ....tells story of a young japanese girl who is sold into slavery and later becomes a geisha .... i was struck with awe at the beauty of this film..it is a feast for the eyes and also the ears as John Williams' score is amazing...with violin solos by Itzak Perlman and YoYo Ma...terrific....the movie isnt even slow and boring...it is engrossing as can be ...totally interesting..im gonna go buy the book..im still amazed at this movie....takes u right into the culture of the japanese and the ways of the geishas
2,Very Disappointing,This was a good movie that suffered from a mediocre BD tranfer as it is just comparable with the DVD release.
1,DualDisc 5.1 Format On This DVD Incompatible,"While the entire set of DualDisc remastered Talking Heads albums work fine on my equipment, this and ONLY this DualDisc fails. Half the audio channels are missing - the keyboard sounds and backing vocals are not on Channels 4 and 5, just... somewhere else. This is not a hardware problem, as I have just tested the same system with other DualDiscs, as well as the system diagnostics.The 5.1 Streams just aren't properly picked up by the player.If DualDisc is this shaky a format, that's the last one I'll buy. Don't waste your money."
1,your [sic] too clever for me neillllll,"Neil is capable of a lot better (try Temple of Low Men & Together Alone). Much of this album is sickly produced in that bubblegum fashion and Neil always seems to sound bigger than his own songs, the result being they're vapid compositions with no genuine pathos or emotion. Suzanne Vega's husband produces and puts in that (yawn) organ solo in ""Don't Dream it's over"" which, not since the days of Noel Coward or Cole Porter, has a song been so screachingly overrated. It's all quite insipid, and fiercely annoying. To give credit to the Impressario himself, he came up trumps on the next album."
2,student workbook - not a teacher's manual,"I assumed from reading the item description that this was a material designed for teachers. Instead I found a workbook for students, complete with spaces to write in your answers to the questions. In many activities, the directions include waiting for the teacher to pass out certain materials such as specific cards to complete the activity. Since there is a student workbook, there is no template for or description of the cards - I am left with no idea of what the exercise was supposed to accomplish. In addition, this book is billed as having ""authentic"" math activities but learning fractions by dividing an imaginary pizza among the students is overused, weak, and not particularly authentic. I was very disappointed by this book, especially considering the high price I paid."
4,Appreciating what you've got,"This book is about both appreciating what you've got and learning learning to treat others the way that you'd like to be treated. The girls in cabin 6 at Camp Sunnyside have been irritated with their cabin's counselor. They think that the girls in the other cabins receive better treatment from their counselors. When their counselor has to leave camp for awhile to tend to a personal problem, the girls have to suffer through a sequence of substitute counselors, each worse than the last. By the time their counselor returns, the girls have learned some lessons about how to treat other people and what constitutes a good counselor."
4,Good disc storage,"Very slender disc cases. Comes with a little rack. Cute shape. Shipping costs were high, more than the cost of the cases."
5,"functional, colorful, with storage, convenient",I love the clam shell shape and design and the convenient storage case.I practice clarinet solos with CD tracks. It is convenient to be able to store them in colorful cases which I keep on my shelf. I'm happy with it.
5,Finally Some Good Southern Music,"I loved Superdrag's 1st 3 albums (especially Head Trip) and i deffinately think this is one of, if not the best album they have produced. The reason being because the ""southernness"" of the sound really sets them apart from other bands.There are a lot of good indie bands out there, but not many that can have a great power-pop song along side a great slow country tune like ""Safe & Warm""( w/ a slide guitar and everything). Neither of the sides seem out of place on the album, which is what makes it great. Though you may want to start w/ the earlier albums, you should deffinitely check this one out."
5,why pay three times more for an hp extended life battery?,"This battery works great! When my original HP extended life battery started showing only 67% charged as a maximum (after three or four years - a normal event, as I understand) I started looking for a replacement. The $51.95 price here on Amazon compared to the $149.99 price on HP Direct. It was a no-brainer - works just great - fits perfectly - looks exactly the same - and I'm back to 5 and 6 hours of battery life for 1/3 the price. I'd have no problem recommending this product. Thanks to Google search for the ""shopping results"" price comparison spot when I entered ""extended life battery for hp dv6000"". I continue to enjoy the same feature on this battery as the HP version - it raises the back of the laptop up for better cooling."
1,HP DV2000 Battery replacement,"I am very upset with this battery because it was described as the correct one for my HP DV2000 Laptop, in fact it works but the only HUGE thing is that it is not the exact replacement. It has a big extra part that makes looks your laptop ugly, half of the battery sticks out of place so now my laptop is like an in a 35 degree angle when I put it on my desk or somewhere else. It looks really bad but since I had opened I knew I could not return so I had to deal with it. Very upset with this product."
1,DID ANYONE PROOF/EDIT THESE RECIPES ?????,What a beautiful book to receive as a gift! BUT.......whoproofed the final print? Just tried my first recipe forTEMPURA BATTER p.62 - Followed it closely but found that3 cups of ice water is way too much water for 4 Tablespoons ofrice flour and 1 egg white. Maybe I should throw the book outwith this bad batch of batter.
3,Missing songs,Several songs missing on the CD. I own the orginal cassette tape and the tape is better more live songs and several regular recordings.
1,No CD in package,I would have loved to listen--I take care of a sick aunt and have not been able to address the fact--that I opened the package and no CD IN THE PACKAGE--I AM SENDING IT BACK THIS WEEK THANKS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO LET YOU KNOW:) JUST WANT MY MONEY BACK THANKS
4,"Kern, CA: observational reporting most local","Stories and essays blend observations of California history and culture with humor as his focus on Kern County, California reveals some of folklore, history and experiences from Haslam's eye. From issues of racism and environmental problems to accounts of fights and encounters with darker community forces, HASLAM'S VALLEY provides first-person observational reporting at its local best."
4,Mirwais' music rocks!,"I bought this album based solely on Mirwais' work on Madonna's ""Music"" and it is really good. Unfortunately the album only has nine tracks and one of them already appeared on Madonna's album. The only track that really blows is ""v.i"". ""Junkie's Prayer"" is really interesting giving us the interpretation of what a junkie would sound like if he/she was praying. The rest of the album is basically stuff Mirwais repeated on Madonna's album but ""Music"" was more commercial and radio-friendly. Madonna's album is not as risk-taking as Mirwais' ""production"" but it still sounds fresh and far from the boring Boy Band & Britney clones ... that plays on .... If any of these teen groups really want to see their careers last, they need to take the Madonna route and search for talent that will help them create musical landscapes that are unique and daring...like Mirwais!"
4,The Future of Music?,"He's the brain behind ""Music"" by madonna. This album is a great collection of dance tunes. The good thing about it is unlike some trance artists, this one suprisingly has alot of variety, putting the upbeat and happy tracks at the front (including the number 1 dance hit ""Naive Song"") and Disco Science. At the second part of the album, he includes the best song on Madonna's new album, Paridise (Not for Me). This song just blows my mind; it is so haunting. This is a great record for a party and is definately a ""club"" type record. If you are just getting into the Moby thing (like i did 1 1/2 yrs ago) give this album a try"
3,A tug at the heart,"For all of you who may have heard the ""bootleg"" version of Madonna's Paradise(not for me) you will be disappointed to find that the version of Paradise(not for me) on this album is different from the upbeat remix you may be familiar with. After hearing the bootleg I was so excited that I could not wait for Madonna's album to come out in the fall so I rushed and ordered the Mirwais cd instead. Bad move? Not really since the rest of the cd is enjoyable.But if you're looking for upbeat Maddi, save your money and wait."
2,"Does not Taste Like ""Hot & Sour""","Annie Chun's Hot & Sour is not awfull, but it doesn't taste good either. Heck, it doesn't even taste like Hot & Sour except for a little ""Hot"". I'm sorry, I like Annie Chun's other soups, like the ""UDON"", but this one I'm not ordering again."
3,Hot and Sour Soup,The noodles are excellent but the rest was just ok. Probably will not order again.
3,Not as satisfying as it could have been,"Although I got a lot of value from est and follow-up est workshops, and I thought this DVD had a lot of good information, I was disappointed that it did not give closure on the two major accusations leveled at Werner--the accusation by a daughter that he had sexualluy abused her, and the episode in which a staffer was choked. The DVD tells us that the daughter recanted but doesn't give any more information. The DVD is an interesting testimonial to a man who indeed had a tremendous influence in the country--but in the end, it side-stepped the opportunity to give clsoure and to put to rest once and for all the bad legends that drove this man out of this country."
5,lovely,"Wonderful. A darring, bold, beautiful sound from Silverchair. Diorama consumes the listener and transports them into another world. The album is very cinematic. It keeps Silverchair's thick bass lines and powerful grooves, but accompanies much of their previous guitar with many different orchestral scores. Heavily influenced and written on piano, this incoporates intricate chord progressions most of todays pop music artists are too afraid to tackle. It was well worth every ounce of my anticipation. A chairfan dream come true. Thanks guys."
4,Silverchair is still totally awesome!,"Silverchair is still a totally awesome band and the album is very much like the 1999 release ""Neon Ballroom."" Daniel Johns has this amazing voice that you just can't help but turn your ear to the music when you hear it and the awesome music playing. The orchestra goes good with the music and the guitar and drum playing is just awesome. This is defiently another great album by a great band and I yet again, look forward to another cd because they are by far, my favorite band in the world."
3,A completely different band.,"Diorama isn't a bad album, but its completely different then anything else by Silverchair. I would really like to know how they could go from an album like Neon Ballroom (one of my favorite albums ever.) to this.... You may like it, but don't be expecting anything like previous albums, because you will be dissapointed like i was."
5,my review,i got the diorama cd last week i lisend to it the songs on this cd are meaningfull it blew me away i love all the songs dan voice is so strong on this cd ti takes you out to a new placeim veryy proud of dan chris and ben for making a cd like thisi want peopple to by this now and lisen to it has alot of emotions on this cd please lisen to it and take youself in to a new place i love this cd alot and i want to thank the band for making diorama apart of my life and i will cherish this for alongtime
3,Not a 23T Motor,"I've only had these motors for a short while and they seem to work well. I am, however, a little disappointed about the error in the product title listing this as a 23T motor. The Traxxas 3975 is a 21T motor. I was looking for a higher turn count motor and chose this one based on the turn count. I just like to know what I'm ordering."
5,Great Re-Release!!!,The sound on this reissue is awesome! There is no comparrison to the original. These songs deserve to be heard again and appreciated. The packaging and liner notes are also top-notched.
5,"""My Sweet Lord"" and People Power II","I wonder whether George Harrison knows that this album's most famous song played a minor but important role in the overthrow of President Joseph Estrada in the Philippines last month? ""Gambling lord...I really want to kick you"" was one of the favourite songs of the hundreds of thousands of demonstrators in this Beatles-mad country who gathered nightly at the ""EDSA shrine"" in downtown Manila prior to Estrada's ouster. The parody of ""My Sweet Lord"" appeared on ""The White Album"", a collection of protest songs set to popular tunes from the 1960s and 1970s. Another popular chant at EDSA -- ""All we are saying, is Erap resign"" -- is of course based on a song by another Beatle. ""Gambling lord"" is funnier if you know the events it is poking fun at, but the overall message is something anyone can enjoy."
3,"Good, but defenintly not the best","All things must pass is a good album with some worthy tracks such as ""Isn't it a pitty"", and ""Wah-wah"", but it is in no way the best Beatles Solo Album, and porbably not even in the top five. It doesn't compare with ""Imagine"", or ""Plastic Ono Band"", or even ""Band on the Run"", I would recomend this album, but just don't expect to listen to it all that much. I listened to it for about a week and got tired of it, it just doesn't compare to any of his Beatles work. Ohh...and might I add that he never had another hit solo-album after All things must pass, could it be that it was a fluke, you tell me. (P.S. My Sweet Lord was plagurized, the origional song he stole some chords and the original beat from is She's so fine)"
3,Dare I say over-rated?,"Regarded by many as Harrison's masterpiece and by many others as arguably the greatest solo Beatle album, err.....it's a little disapointing. There's some great songs here, though many are as good as ruined either by Spector's production (the title track does not need that brass riff, and 'Hear Me Lord' gets drowned) or by over-lengthy arrangements (both 'Isn't It A Pity's and 'Wah-Wah'). The simpler tunes work the best: 'What Is Life?', 'My Sweet Lord', 'Behind That Locked Door',and 'Beware Of Darkness' are all first-rate. As everyone else has said, the jamming tracks are a bore and the whole shebang needs remastering/remixing/repackaging (take your pick!). I can't help but feeling George could have presented his Beatles-era song stockpile more convincingly because it could/should have been a great album."
4,"Remaster, PLEASE!","George, please, please, PLEASE re-master this, your greatest recording! These songs are just way too good to leave buried under a pile of Spector mush!!George rocks out on ""Wah, Wah."" I love that tune."
1,One perfect song,"Please don't get me wrong... I consider My Sweet Lord one of the greatest songs of George Harrison and probably one of the best songs in rock history, but I don't wish to get 2CD huge album just for this... I have ATMP on MP3, and unfortunately I don't have any wish to buy it in Audio Format... the whole album is just boring and you want to turn it off immediately listening to every song, but My Sweet Lord... which is the only song I listen to with great pleasure in this album... Get ATMP on MP3, and than consider bying it on CD..."
4,An excellant cthulhu mythos collection,This is an unusually good collection of cthulhu mythos stories. They include both mythos stories and some non mythos stories with a mythos feel.While there are one or two clunkers the quality is generally excellant. Also these are not the usual reprints but are either rarely or never reprinted stories.Of particular note to me was BLACK NOON by C M EDDY which gave a glimpse into the life of H P LOVECRAFT whom the author knew. If you are a fan of lovecraft and the cthulhu mythos by all means try this book.
1,I don't appreciate the joke,"The picture shows individually packaged portions of several straws each. The description said 2 lbs. The belief was was 48 individual packages. The reality is 48 individual straws, seemingly taken from a bulk pack with no individual packages and perhaps 3 ounces total. If this is someone's idea of a joke, IT IS NOT FUNNY. If I have to haul these to Seattle myself to return them, they are going back!!!!"
2,Outdated,"Don't get me wrong. There are some good songs on this compilation. Imagine, Mind Games, and Whatever Gets You Through The Night among others are strong tracks. However, with the subsequent release of Double Fantasy and future compilation releases, this one is missing a great deal. The Imagine album is only represented by the title track here. That record alone is on a greatest hits level and should be more represented. What also bothers me is that John's voice is overly strained throughout much of the first half of this disc. I think I'm going to search for another compilation that is more complete."
3,Not Hypoallergenic,The seller was prompt to respond after I returned the items.We could not use them because the fragrance was too strong.Can be right for someone else.
1,Wish I had seen these reviews before I puchased this junk,The absolutely biggest piece of garbage I have ever ordered. Can not believe anybody actually sold this item with a straight face.
4,Nice watch,"This is a well made and reasonably priced watch. The 3 mini dials on the watch are so small as to be unreadable but adds to the look of the face. This is a large watch in length and width but thin in design, reading the time is not a problem. Made of titanium, the pewter looking finish with the rubber band is a very good look. Highly recommended.If you purchase from e-watches be prepared for a long wait. Ordered my watch August 23, 2005 and received it September 9, 2005."
3,A Little Disappointed,"This watch looks ok, but is difficult to read. Another reviewer was right on track saying you cannot read the smaller dials."
1,the inner torment,"You wanna know my theory about John Lennon? I reckon that being the focus of so much adulation from an uncritical audience made him swing violently between delusions of grandeur (""Imagine"") and self-disgust (""Plastic Ono Band""). The psychic effort of it pretty much exhausted him, until eventually he settled into the zombified equilibrium of making bland, worthless mid 70's solo albums like this thing."
5,Another Great Lennon Album!,"Walls and Bridges is a great album. I would actually give it 4 and one half stars. It doesn't quite equal Imagine and it isn't close to Plastic Ono Band. I would still reccomend, though. The highlights of the album are Whatever Gets You Thru The Night, What You Got, #9 Dream, Steel and Glass and Nobody Loves You. All the other songs are slightly weak, but still good. This is a great album. Buy It."
4,The Lost Weekend,"Recorded when John was separated from Yoko. When this first came out, the reception was warm, but not overwhelmingly favorable. Hindsight tends to make this album seem a little better. However, the music is reaches high points more often than not. Capitol should try to restore some of the sleeve elements to this package, as it contained a number of drawings made by John during his schooldays and the original die-cuts were a lot of fun to play with."
5,whence,I am very satisfied with all the SHELL SCOTT books I purchased plus all the other books from your company
1,Peterson's Guide to Distance Learning Programs,"The 2002 edition isn't of the same usefulness of editions published by Peterson's 10 or so years ago. The 2002 edition is of little or no usefulness. It has very limited tuition cost information or course descriptions. The 2002 edition also doesn't list many colleges which can be found on the internet, which is a better source of information than this book. Peterson's seems to have gotten lazy in their research for this book. SOMEBODY AT PETERSON'S... look at the editions you published 10 or so years ago and get a clue. I WASTED MY MONEY THIS TIME. THE 2002 EDITION IS A WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY!"
4,finally,been looking for something like this for my 15 year old daughter who is interested in becoming a fashion model. i found it a good source of information on the subject- thanks
2,A snooze a minute,"Paul McCartney has a very mellow songwriting style that seldom works to his advantage. Only on rare ocasions does it work (No more lonely nights, band on the run), but most of the time it just drags along leaving you waiting for the song to end. I would have given this 3 STARs except for its omission of ""Maybe i'm Amazed"" which is his best song. I was also, might i add, because of this omission that I was forced to buy his debuet album, a new adventure in badness."
5,All the best,"This is an excellent list of songs on a CD for Paul's work after the Beatles. I only wish it had ""Too Many People"" from the Ram album on it. But other than that, this is a keeper for the collection."
1,What a piece of junk,"Don't waste your money on this toy! It took a long time to assemble and came with 75 sticker decals to attach. The ""jet"" broke almost immediately (it's made of flimsy foam), the helicopter doesn't fly correctly and the ramps fall apart too easily. My son doesn't have any fun with this toy, instead he gets frustrated and irritated that it doesn't work like the T.V. commercial shows. So please, please don't spend a dime for this toy."
1,Mother,"This will be the last Hot Wheels trap I will fall into. With 2 boys, ages 4 and 6 it is hard to not listen when this junk is on their santa list. The thing falls apart almost instantly. What a disappointment to the young and old! I even tried hot glueing the thing together. It just plain fails in all areas. Hope Hot Wheels improves or they will be another failed company."
2,Get Octoblast Instead,"Great commercials will get you to buy this toy, but its hard to put together and needs constant adjusting to work. Once put together, kids' toys should just work without tinkering. The parts don't stay in place and it just does these little one -shot gimmicks. Hot Wheels are a fun part of any boys' toy chest, but if you want a Hot Wheels toy that plays like it should, get Octoblast."
3,Not that good,"I think this book is ok for someone who is just getting introduced to the concept of life between lives. However, after having read similar books by Michael Newton, this one was a disappointment to me. Too basic, doesn't go deep enough. I would highly recommend Newton's books instead."
5,"Comfortable, but you can still hear!","I use these for concerts. They're much more comfortable than foam or those ""Christmas tree"" style ear plugs. They block out excess noise and allow you to hear the music."
2,Its definitely a B movie.,This movie was ok but I would not have bought it if I would have seen it first. Not a must own.
5,Informative,"This is simply the best book on the subject.Answered all of my questions trough clear examples and was surprisingly up to date.It would be nice if there were more material on open source legal issues, however."
1,disappointing,"i was very disappointed in this book. i have been using digital for years now and my landscapes are turning out very good, however, my snapshots of kids and everyday events don't turn out so good. i thought i had finally found a book to help with this. however, the author spends so much time covering camera basics and fixing photos in photoshop. why does every camera ""how to"" book do this? i wish they would just stick to the subject. however, even the couple of chapters that were devoted to actually photographing your kids was not very helpful. she covered the rules of thirds, and a few lighting tips. that's about it. i was very disappointed in the material, and for the price, it just isn't worth it."
1,La India,"Coghead (Brooklyn, NY): I understand how you feel, but we must understand that every artist must one: create his/her own style and two: they have to keep up with what is in style. Reggaeton is a new genre and in order to be competitive and have longivity in this business you can still stick to your style but you have to keep pace with what's in. I love La India and yes the cd could be better but her cd is up to date with what is being listened to. Maybe for her next album, Pure Salsa will be back in style. La India will always be the next female Celia."
5,"This book was very, VERY good!","Well, i thouroughly enjoyed this book. It definately gave a feel to the movie, and some more background that answered all the questions I had about the movie. It was just cool! The insight into the Characters emotions at certain points were also good. Overall i think the book was very good!"
3,Choklat,"The Choklat Crunch Dark Chocolate was as advertised and was delivered undamaged and quickly. No problems at all on that side, however when we opened the package the first crunch bar we opened was discolored around the edges and tasted old. I know that chocolate will sometimes discolor due to oils coming to the surface but I don't expect to find it in a chocolate bar I just received through the mail. Other bars in the package were also discolored as well. The date on the package indicated that the product was not passed the expiration date and still had several months of shelf life. That leads me to believe that the storage methods might need to be examined."
2,choklat crunch bars through Amazon,"I received the bars and they were all white and old tasting. I had purchased one at a health store and really liked it,this is why I ordered a box of them. They ended up not being any cheaper and surely wasn't as good"
4,Just received it overnight,"This item came the next day after ordering. I really like the bag. It is hard bottomed and made of heavy,padded canvas that keeps it's form. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star rating is that there is only one outside pocket and no inside dividers or pockets, except for the ones used to store pistol, magazines, etc. I does hold 300-500 rounds of ammo without a problem"
5,It is what it is,I bought this paper for my daughter for school. It's just fine. I would buy it again if she needs more.
5,Tremendous Illustrative Effort,"This book contains BEAUTIFUL line-art illustrations of a host of Lockheed aircraft, past and present. The artwork was done by Mike Badrocke who is a recognized master at this craft. Bill Gunston is also a master aviation writer. Together they've produced a very beautiful book for the aviation enthusiast. You'll see cutaways of the A-12, C-5, F-16, F-117, U-2, and even the F-22. There are civil aircraft cutaways such as the Constellation and L-1011. Helicopters, WW2 aircraft and before are all represented. It's a wonderful book to help you ""explore"" the inner workings of these aircraft, and nobody does it better than Badrocke."
4,Still relevent today.,"I found myself amazed as a read each chapter of RFKs own words and problems plaguing America; unemployment, neglect of the poor (or working poor if you prefer,a sorry eduction system, pollution, war, and greed. What surprises me more is that we are still suffering from the same problems.... and his solutions look worth trying."
4,A time capsule of hope,"Culled partially from speeches and position papers regarding the issues of the time(1967), Bobby Kennedy offers his views on those issues and his solutions to perhaps fix them.Today, much of this is only of historical interest, as Vietnam and other such issues are a thing of the past. But this is still worth reading for non-historians for what RFK has to say about his faith in young people to create a society that has learned form the mistakes of its elders. Pretty inspiring stuff on that level."
5,A True Classic!,"This performance features three of the finest artists the world of jazz has ever produced. I have had a vinyl of thisperformance since circa 1978, and I unhesitatingly bought the dvd of it when I learned it was available. It was greatto hear and see Oscar and Ray play together again, It is rare to find such rapport as these two guys had. And itis difficult to find the words to express my amazement when I first heard NHOP's solos. Absolutely stunning. Allthree of these gentlemen are,sadly, no longer with us. But I am grateful that this display of their greatness is capturedon this dvd."
1,Blood pressure cuff has an extra valve that leaks,We have to keep our finger over the valve to keep it from leaking in order to use the cuff. Not sure what the value of the additional valve is. There does not appear to be any directions included.
3,Very Large,Cuff was a little bigger than expected. Wish it would of been available in different sizes. Other than size it works fine.
2,Designed for automated equipt.,"I ordered the above thinking it would fit a gauge and pump that I used on another large cuff. It did not--it is designed for specific electronic equipment.I sent it back for a refund and found the refund system works well at amazon. Good quality for the right equipment, but not what I needed."
4,An excellent collection of the hits,"So many great pieces in one box! I couldn't be happier.My only gripe is that the audio quality is a little short (a little hiss and overall a bit thin). This is from an ""Audiophile"" perspective however and, as a technical opinion, this should not interfere with the enjoyment of a fantastic era of music!!!"
1,poor,"The item I ordered was ""Legendary Henry Mancini"" that is 3 cd set while the item you sent was ""Henry Mancini & his orchestra"". In addition to the fact that I do not want the item you sent, I was charged by the price of the item I ordered, not the one I received.The strange thing is: I tried to find the item you sent on your web site just to compare prices, but it was not there.Is there any hope to get the item I seek and return the wrong one? (With the fact that I am in Egypt now taken into the consideration)..Thanks & regards.."
5,As good or better Than Snap-on,"I've spent more than $25,000 on Snap-on, Mac, Matco, Craftsman and Cornwell over the past 34 years and never found anything better at any price. Currant price for Snap-on PN#320SIM 3/8"" to 1 9/16"" is $716.55. I have Grey pneumatic deep & shallow in 3/8 & 1/2"" drive metric & inch as well as Torx, hex, pipe plug and 12 point impact and haven't broken one yet. Plus the cases are durable."
4,No as bad as everyone says,"I really don't understand why people think this album isn't very good. It opens with the instrumental ""Into the Lungs of Hell"", which has amazing energy, the goes onto ""Set the World Afire"", which comes from the angry Megadeth roots. The 3rd track is a waste I have to admit. They cover the Sex Pistols' ""Anarchy in the U.K"", which has no place on a heavy metal album. The fourth and 6th tracks (""Mary Jane"" and ""In My Darkest Hour"") are written from the same riff, and they sound noticably samey. Back to the good points, ""502"" is a great track for driving, as it is about driving.""Liar"" is my favourite song on the album, cause I love the opening riff. The final track is ""Hook in Mouth"" which is also one of my favourites because of all the insrumental bits, and Dave did a good job at writing the music on this one."
5,metalhead,"the best release from the best thrash metal group ever!!! I've loved every thing megadeth has ever made but so far, so good, so what!! is my all time favorite by megadeth. From track 1 to track 9 is amazing, a must have for any megadeth fan."
2,NOT THE BEST,"People keep saying this is a great album. The truth is: it is NOT !!!! This is not the real MEGADETH. TWith the exception of PEACE SELLS, MEGADETH only took off with RUST IN PEACE andwhen MARty Friedman came to the ranks."
1,John Steven's music is boring,"After hearing John Stevens on American Idol, and his boring music I will NOT buy this CD. I am not a fan of classical music. In fact, it puts me to sleep. John Stevens doesn't really have an excitement to his music. It's just plain boring, and uninteresting. I am really surprised that he got a contract. Classical music isn't very popular, and probably only a minority will buy this boring music. Sure, John Stevens is a nice guy, but I don't think that his style of music will put him on the charts. If you would like a GOOD CD from an American Idol contestant, just buy Diana's or Kelly Clarkson's."
1,Al Capone: The Untouchable Legend,"This video is more like a home movie than a serious documentary. There was not enough pictures and information of Al Capone or the era in which he lived. On the other hand there was much too many pictures and inserts of the film makers friends , family, and stuff unrecognizable to most viewers. A big disappointment. The other review must be from friends or family to incourage the films makers, but you do an injustice to them and the general public. Certainly these reviews are to incourage buyers, not make them leary of their purchases."
1,A Mess,"Ordered this book, it got sent to someone else, then when they recieved it back they couldn't find it. It took 2 months to get my refund. Not a happy experience. To many problems. Still want the book though."
5,"Wow, I have my deer hunting bible now","I bought this book after reading the other positive reviews.Now, I am happy to add my compliments to the authors for writing an excellent book.I am going hunting for the second time this season.Last season I was completely unsuccessful in locating any deer.After reading this book now I have a couple of reasons why.And I am now armed with some great tactics to use while in the field.Great book, the authors earn every last cent paid for it.Thanks guys."
1,Where's the rest of the book?,"I had read an article on Edita Kaye's Skinny Rules diet and I found it interesting so in order to learn more about this diet I decided to buy the book. Here's the info I wish I had known before buying it: This book is TINY! It's about the size a preteen paperback novel; the pages barely contain one paragraph each in a large font. There are only 11 pages in this entire book that outline the eating plan and another 6 pages with interesting ""big fat lies"". So out of the 93 ""pages"" in this book, only 17 are worth reading..."
1,don't buy this,"unless you've never read a book on nutrition, this is a waste of time. the content is poor and there is nothing that one couldn't find on the web."
5,Getting Skinny With Edita Is Easy and FAST and Saved My Life,"I'm a big believer in ""less is more"" and I've been striving to be less than my weight for years. Even my doctor had given up on me. Now, with this little book, Edita has made my ""less is more"" real for me. I've lost 104 pounds in just a few weeks...and I'm wearing a belt, with my shirt tucked in for the first time in 20 years. Edita and her little book are the best. Different. Easy. And a true blessing to those of us who have tried everything and still couldn't lose. Buy this book. Buy it for yourself and buy copies for everyone you know who is trying to lose and can't. It will change your life. It changed mine."
1,No Warranty for product,"Do not buy this product online because there is no warranty for the product, except for those sold by an installer."
4,Hot Wheels Octoblast Track Set,[$$$] is more like it for this toy instead of [$$$]. It takes up so much space and my son only played with it for a couple of days. If you loose a car you can't buy replacement cars.
2,My kids lost interest after 5 minutes,Save your money - the screeching racket this thing makes will drive parents crazy and my boys (age 7 and 4) lost interest after 5 minutes. The cars constantly got stuck or fell off and even when they didn't there's nothing for kids to do except sit and watch - zero participation.
1,It's a miracle this thing got made.,"It doesn't quite come up to the insane level of incomprehensibility of ""Dragon Wars"", but this is one incoherent movie. It looks pretty... the scenery is beautiful in much of the film... but the story is ridiculous on many levels. Perhaps the silliest bit is when the Nazi officer gives his Luger pistol to the protagonist near the end of the film instead of just shooting him. WTF??!!! I actually laughed out loud at that moment.There is probably a really good movie to be made about the ""Buffalo Soldiers"" in WWII. Maybe more than one. But this surely is not it. What a disappointment."
1,"Overdone, Overly Subtitled & Boring","Typical Spike Lee, not sure why I even gave this a chance. Poorly written (and inaccurate at times), jumps all over the place, mostly subtitled and way too long.2 1/2 hours later, wasn't sure what the miracle was.Don't waste your time on this one."
2,Clarification:,"Just wanted to clarify about the point of ""not speaking in the proper period"". If you're referring to the use of ""the N-word"" it may be a surprise to you that it had been used casually WAY before the 80s and 90s, mostly around street-saavy folks, as has other slang we so naively believe is modern. If you don't have lineage in that community, or didn't grow up with Black folk around that time, then of course it's going to come off as modern to you."
2,A mess at St Anna,Where do I start. This has lots of stuff in it........complicated Italian & German dialogue. But the story itself is lame. It does not make any logical sense. Are we supposed to be interested in these people just because they are black?Spike Lee has a lot of talent but his rant about Clint Eastwoods portrayal of Iwo is just plain stupid. Watch the footage of the marines. They were white. Get over it.
2,Can someone PLEASE tell me what the Miracle was?,"Unless it was the Italian woman getting naked, I have no idea what the miracle was.Please tell me!!!"
1,Wow - This is Bad!!!!,"Miracle? I suppose one could perceive that to mean: If you can make it through 60 minutes of this ""film,"" it will be a miracle! Racial propaganda about sums it up!"
1,Typical Spike Lee nonsense,"This movie was worse than bad. With a catchy TV trailer, I began watching it with some hope for entertainment, but walked away about halfway through it when it became evident that there was no value to be had whatsoever of sticking it out. Racist, historically inaccurate, poorly acted, poorly directed, and generally laughable, Spike Lee has lived up to his reputation of being an amateur, once again. What a waste of time."
1,This DVD would be best used as a coaster for your coffeetable,"This movie was absolutely painful to watch. The case says it's the ""Best war movie since Saving Private Ryan"". If this is true, Hollywood should be closed. Forever.The acting was high school drama production-level. The battle scenes were, at best, unconvincing. (Who could possibly carry a marble head on his hip through the heat of battle?)On my deathbed, I hope I'm granted an extra two hours of life to make-up for the time I wasted with this tripe."
4,Great additon to the collection,If you are south Florida history buff you won't want to miss this latest Matthiessen offering.
2,Sorry to say it,"This is a child's compilation. If you're looking for nastalgic games, look elswhere. This is young child oriented. Why someone would want to go out and attempt to get their kids addicted to video games, the way they most likely became, is beyond me. Sonic, Sonic 2, Altered Beast... they're fun. Except Genesis has a huge repertoire of titles. Was final fantasy 4 too expensive with the franchise still in partial swing? Very dissapointed, should've paid closer attention to the line up. One of the many iterations of rampage would have made my rating slightly higher. No problems with the interface or difficulty levels, just that many of the games seem just thrown in there, they call this a favorites collection. Shows that Sony will try to sell you a semiprecious stone for ten times it's actual value, possibly even calling the official gemstone to Ecco the Dolphin. Three versions of Ecco the Dolphin, you gotta be pulling my leg!"
1,horrible..something to just pass time,"I bought this for my boyfriend along with 5 other games as a valentines present ( He was 19 but, i figured that i should just save the chocolates, and teddy bear things till another time)Anyways, i bought him 6 games total, including this Sega Genesis collection..I asked him how it was....He didn't like it at all...it was just something to do to pass timeI have not actually seen this game in person yet, so im just giving you guys /his reviewSo, if your'e going to buy this for a person that's into gaming, this would NOT be a choiceHOPE THIS HELPED..now i got you all skeptic about buying this game, because there were so many GREAT Reviews and here's my one negative review..(well, just telling the truth, people need the truth on what they buy! ESPECIALLY over the internet!)"
5,5 star review,"I found Hippies From A to Z a very fasinating book filled with lots of information that I ( a hippie ) was unaware of. The music facts were mind-blowing, showing that Mr. Stone had done his homework on the subject of music during the 60's and 70's. The overall read was easyand everythig flowed like msic itself. I have turned on other friends to Hippies From A to Z and they too are as impressed as I am . I give this a 5 star review and recomend it to all those interested in learning more about the hippies."
3,Good paper just not enough,"The paper is standard origami paper, very light weight and flexible and comes packaged very well. My husband had ordered this for me because I use Origami at work to teach teens patience, persistence, and teamwork. I bought this to add some different colors to the mix of things. The colors were bright and shiny and the origami turned out wonderful. There just was not nearly enough paper in the pack for the price. Other than the price, it worked great. Just beware that some of the folds are a little harder to see where the foil is shiny rather than normal origami paper that is matte."
5,Just what I needed,these jointer blades are for the Makita 2030N but will fit the Makita 2030 so if you are looking for 2030 Jointer blades these are the ones to get.
5,the real truth,"Read the other reviews if you must. The most important thing is, how often do you listen to this album. I listen to it more than most early 60s and 50s concept albums. So this record is much better than people say. Obtain it if you don't have it. It's not better than Songs for Swingin Lovers/Swing Easy, but so what. This is a must have for any serious Sinatra fan."
2,red leather cat collar,"The red leather cat collar is ok however, I do not like that the leather is a bit thin and the end of the collar does not stay in place. Sadly my cat will not have this collar long as it is not that strong therefore, I will be looking for another cat collar that has stamina and looks great."
1,Problem with this CD,"Sony will not allow you to play this CD in your computer, without installing some very bad software. Read this article for the full story on what Sony is doing: http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,1895,1880572,00.aspFrom this day forward I will never spend another dime on content that I can't use the way I please. If I can't copy it to my hard drive and play it using the devices I want, when and where I want, I won't be buying it. Period."
4,Elizabethtown,I ordered BOTH albums to make my own mix from. I didn't know what to expect even though I saw the movie. I was pleasantly surprized and liked over half of the songs; they suited my taste.I find I'm looking at movie credit for music and I do run into some pretty good stuff.
3,Neat stuff here and there...,"There's going to be a wide variety on any soundtrack to a Cameron Crowe film. Elizabethtown's is no exception, featuring the likes of Ryan Adams, Elton John, and even the Gainesville native, Tom Petty. ""Shut Us Down"" by Fleetwood Mac's Lindsey Buckingham is probably the album pinnacle, while ""Long Ride Home"" by Patty Griffith has me scratching my head.In reality, the whole assortment is like a big ol' dinner - lots of side dishes and too many main courses. Elton John's ""My Father's Gun"" dominates the latter; Ryan Adam's ""Come Pick Me Up"" is ridiculously melancholy, and although there's a sample of Nancy Wilson's contributions, you'll need to buy the score for the better half.Unfortunately, there's a lot missing. No U2 here, as seen in the film's closing moments, and one of the better selections from Crowe, Ulrich Schnauss's ""Passing By,"" you'll have to find somewhere online.You'll need both albums to really catch the feel of the film."
3,okay soundtrack,like the other soundtrack i was quite disappointed to see some songs not on here but its a good listen to.
4,I like it.,"It tastes good. It mixes good. What more do you want? And it's cheap! I feel better about not getting artificial stuff in my mix. I've tasted better, but not for this kind of money.Definitely recommended."
2,"It may have it's place as the first Gothic, but it's still bad","This mess of a book, a semblance of ideas inspired largely by Shakespeare is nothing less than throw-away trash. This book is an inspiration to the art of cheesy writing, with silly visuals (a Monty Python opening involves a large helmet falling from the sky and crushing a weakling boy on his wedding day) and horrid dialog ""Alas! Help! Help!"" this book had me both laughing and bewildered.Remember two things when considering this book, Walpole published it himself (we call that ""vanity press"" now) and he didn't take credit for it! He published under pseudonym and claimed it was a translation of an ancient text, thus twice distancing himself from it. Only after it sold did he admit he wrote it, then claimed his own genius. Though, as a new work, critics that found a translation interesting soon realized this ""modern"" work was in fact, bad. And it still is today.Let me quote Clive Barker ""Burn this book.""It's bad, really, really, bad."
4,Delightfully humorous ghost story.,"It's more of short story than a book. A humorous, if not sick and twisted, tale of a ghost grown too big for his castle."
4,The only book needed to pass the switching exam.,"Great book, covers everything you need to pass the CCNP 640-504 exam. Hands-on lab could be great also if not for some ""Typos"". I work in an Internet Data Center in Singapore and have full hands-on in 5500 Switch and 7500 Router (along with those lower-end switches and routers), and I could tell you that Sybex Cisco Certification Series Books are great if not the best in the market. I'm using all Sybex books to earn my Cisco Certs, currently I'm holding CCNA2 (which I use the greatest book ever printed, the Sybex CCNA Study Guide) and now preparing for Foundation 640-509."
5,Science Close-up Gemstones,"ISBN 0307128539 - Golden Books are best known for their gold foil spines on titles aimed at young readers. The Science Close-Up series is not those books.Gemstones is geared toward slightly older readers and is more educational. Explaining what gemstones are, where they are found and how they used, this book could have been a rather dry, boring read for kids. Instead, with a few interesting stories mixed in with the useful facts, Gemstones will appeal to readers. All of this makes it a great tool for reports and a quick way to learn a lot - even for adults!- AnnaLovesBooks"
2,Manufacturing design error,The product is excellent for a couple of weeks. Then the little nib of crayon or whatever is used up and there is no way to make it extend out to use any more. It's encased in plastic and can't be sharpened. There seems to be a serious defect in design here. I wouldn't buy it again unless there's some way to screw the contents further down the tube.
3,Wear,"Book was almost completely separated from spine, didn't mention that in description, I realize it wasn't new, but I have to hold it together."
4,Blast From the Past,This is a good read for people with the case of nostalgia. Even though it was written by the great Chris Claremont it does have its moments were the story moves really slow. But on an up side this is a very cohesive storyline taking place in several books. Unlike Marvel titles today everything seems to fit together pleasently.
4,Short and Sweet,This is a very short but good book. There's about 21 pictures of two models and some objects. One model is Audrey Marnay and the other one might be Malgosia Bela or Guinevere van Seenus. The pictures are beautiful and very artistic. These pictures are somewhat like the ones he does for Italian Vogue. I recommend it.
5,A book for a Video Game,"I heard about this book from a review for a video game entitled ""Mother 3."" After reading it, I was impressed by the amazing writting. The storyline, based on the bond between twins, was amazing. It felt like an RPG (Role Playing Game) in a book."
3,"Good, but not the whole story","I read this book right after I had read ""A Fighting General"" by Norman Cooper, a bio of General Holland Smith. Mr. Gailey's book is a fine description of both Generals Smith and the problems and bad feelings between the army, navy and marines in the pacific during the war. However, I found Mr. Gailey tended to favor army general Ralph Smith's side over that of general Holland Smith. Perhaps this was due to the author's having had the chance to personally interview Ralph Smith but not Holland Smith. Gailey's admiration for Ralph Smith is apparent throughout the book. If you wish to get both sides of this story and learn the real reason Holland Smith relieved the army general I recommend Dr. Cooper's bio of Holland Smith. He devotes many pages to the controversy and presents both sides of the argument. Both books are well-worth the read. And, if you're really into this, by all means read Holland Smith's ""Coral and Brass."""
5,Best Cream,My wife has used it for over 40 years. Loves it and she looks 20 years younger....No other cream will do...
3,Not what I had expected,"To be fair, if you're browsing through the erotic photos section of the website and you come across a book called ""provocative shots"", you're hoping for something pretty special. I even chose it in preference to ""Absolut verboten: total filth 1950-2000"". Still, it makes for an interesting discussion point when liberal friends come round, and also provides a quick and easy way to get rid of unwelcome prudish neighbours. Recommended more as a communications strategy than a thrill."
3,donnerjack,"i have to admit, i thought that zelazny would be better, after reading lord demon and the great book of amber i was a bit dissapointed, however it was creative and imaginative, if you all want to know how the real matrix started and include a bit of romantic fantasy- well here you are."
5,brilliant and unforgetable,Many reviews here say what I feel about this terrific film. I particulary love it for going right to the core of the gypsy Psyche -living in the moment with all the colours of the human spectrum. I love the musical score Perhan repeats through the film and the female vocal than transcends tradgedy. And the film whilst moving and quite funny is tragic. It shows the gypsy's vitality and imagination and delinquency is yet marred by plain mean spiritness. It is a negative that is nothing to glorify but perhaps the film does and the sense of waste is upsetting.No doubt only available in VHS for copy-right reasons. It's so good its worth the price of a player.....!
1,no,"I am surprized everybody likes this movie. Not me. If the movie is not on public channels its not worth it. Like my favored "" When Harry met Sallie"" which is shown regularly and after I watched it about 20 times I start thinking--United States is communistic country after all.Additional trouble is I cannot buy this ""Time of the gypsies"" which again and again proves we dont need it.Hahaha."
1,I sent my kids to college for THIS?,"Mind-bogglingly rude kick-off to dog-eat-dog life or merely a tasteless attempt to be funny?Examples of what you'll find in this book... tips for disguising (not fixing) holes in the wall of your dorm room (to escape damage fines) and how to lie on your roommate survey so you'll get someone neat who might pick up after you. Cover claims to being a totally honest guide, but it's more like a primer in cruelty and the worst sort of values for dealing with people, personal property, your school, etc.Few genuinely redeeming sections in a book with an attitude that would get you kicked out of Kindergarten."
3,Not work w iPod or ELPH,"Pros: compact. Can run w/o own power source.Cons:-my laptop has Vista 32-bit Home Premium. My laptop won't recognize my iPod nano (4th gen) nor my Canon ELPH SD 850 IS Powershot when connected via the hub (not sure why...)- the mini-usb port that allows the hub to connect to the computer broke (the metal piece came out, can't be put back w/o soldering and electronic know-how) after 1 yr 4 months. (Warranty only 1 yr if there is one...)-waay too light. I can't install it permanently with the optional attachment, because I don't own my furniture. Without affixing the hub, it slides all over with the slightest pull on a cable."
2,Not Powered,The power cable for the hub did not function; having many cords plugged in caused it to create interference and slowed transfers.
1,doesn't work properly,"I really wanted this device to work well. I had problems with it continually disconnecting and reconnecting. I thought it might have been because I didn't have the power cord attached and it wasn't getting enough power from the USB, but plugging in the power adapter didn't help.It's been going on since I got the product and it's very annoying to constantly hear the alert on Windows when the devices connect and reconnect -- literally hundreds of time per hour! I didn't even realize there was a time limit for returns, luckily I signed on today and saw I had on more day to return it.I thought about exchanging it, but then I read the other reviews on here, and I don't want to go through the hassle again. I think I'll just find another more reliable brand.I like the construction of the device--it looks and feels nice. But let's face it, if a USB hub doesn't work, it doesn't matter what it looks like. It needs to work."
4,Looks good and works as expected,"Very compact and good looking (for USB ports) and feels solid. Blue light is always on (and serves no purpose) but it is not too bright, so it is not too big a deal"
1,"Poor design, and it failed too.","I was looking forward to increasing my connection capacity with this 7 port hub (currently have a 4 port), but was disappointed in the design of this unit. The 2-piece design (hub and base) seems like a good idea but doesn't really work well. They include a stick-on foam strip to help keep the hub attached to the base, but this is clearly an after-thought to correct the problem users had with the hub slipping out of the base. I ended up setting the base aside and just using the main hub component. Oh, and it also failed to work! The main cable connecting the hub to the computer had a poor connection at the hub that caused any attached device to work intermittently - not a pleasant experience. Returned unit for credit after attempting to use it for one day."
1,Not so reliable,I've owned two of these. The first lasted a year before it started acting very sporadic and died. The second one has failed in three months. I like the design but I don't think I will get another...
3,Not reliable,"I have owned this for just over a year and have found it to be mostly unreliable. Sometimes it will charge devices (external power adapter is being used), sometimes it won't. Sometimes devices will be noticed by computer, sometimes not (they are always noticed when plugged into computer's USB ports). Two of the 7 ports on the hub don't ever work anymore."
3,"New one dead, old one still running","I own two of these, one I purchased two years ago, and another that just hit the one year mark. The two year old is still running strong and I have never had any problems with it but the newer one just stopped working last week. The new one was used at work, plugged into a UPS (not on battery side), mounted where nothing could touch it and there was plenty of airflow, and now it has no connection. At the price I paid I expected a few more years out of this thing, and while I'm happy the other still works there is no reason this one should have failed at the one year mark. Other than that the looks feel are good, and it worked like it was supposed to and I like the mounting design, very functional."
5,3 Years and still going,"Brought this hub three years ago and it's still working fine. I would not use it to plug in devices that require ""data transfer"". Most of theses items I have the manufacture recommends that they be connected directly to your computer through its USB ports. I have found this to be mostly true. Additionally, some devices causes my computer not to boot up when connect initially. No problem...I just wait until computer has booted to plug them in."
1,garbage,"so i bought this device b/c i find that i am running out of usb ports for all the harddrives and what not i've been buying, and i seem to be in the minortiy, but it just doesn't work, everything i plug into it not recognizable by the computer, so figured id put my two cents in"
1,Perhaps I got a bad one...,"...as every other review glows positively about this, but I've experienced 'iffy' ports(live at one moment, dead other times, replugging the cord sometimes helps, other times not), and sub-USB 1.0 transfer speeds with this hub. I've tried different cables and the fault seems to lie with the hub itself.Pity, because on the plus side, it IS a nice sturdy metal package that seems well built.======================Update:Amazon did a no-hassle replacement on the hub.Four months later, no repeat problems.Guess I did indeed get a bad one.Too bad Amazon doesn't allow rating edits, I'd bump it up to a five."
4,Cables to Go 7 Port USB Hub,"Overall a very good product. Looks nice and performs well. The only problem I had was the interaction with my HP ScanJet scanner. It does not work to plug that scanner into that USB hub! (Or probably into any USB hub, for that matter--I suspect the real problem was the scanner.) Not only did the scanner stop working when I plugged it into the hub, when I would reboot, the entire USB bus would sometimes stop working and none of my USB ports would function. I finally got smart enough to plug my scanner directly into the computer and not go through the hub, and that solved the problem."
5,Works like a charm on Vista 64 Bit,"Truly Plug n' Play on Windows Vista 64 Bit. 2 Printers, Microphone, Hard Drive, all work fine and it never flakes out. Solid design as well, easy to plug into, etc."
5,Works Great!,"Needed more USB ports on my Mac, and this fits the bill. Works great with my printer & external drives."
1,"Runs hot, died after a year","I was initially really excited about this as well, since the metal construction seemed really solid and reliable. But, it may be for a reason. The device generates a lot of heat, and it's performance degraded over time. A couple of months ago I started getting warnings from Vista that the hub was no longer running at 2.0 speeds, and transfers to my disk drive were getting slow and unstable. Then, last week, it died entirely, showing up as ""unrecognized device"" in the OS."
1,Crashing my PC,"This usb hub works fine except after anytime from 30 minutes to 4 hours, it crashes my PC, xp pro amd 3700+.The first hub stopped the restart at the Bios.The replacement allows the restart."
4,Solid USB,I bought 2 of these. I like the size and weight of them and the fact you can mount the base to your desk. I used a mounting putty so I didn't damage the surface of the desk and that has worked well. The 2nd one I bought came with the side cap laying in the package but it was easily glued back on.
1,Looks nice but faulty.,"Nice blinking lights, however it never worked for connecting anything. Next time I'll buy a different brand."
5,Love the hub so far!,"I've had many usb hubs for my Mac Pro over the past year or two. Unfortunately most ""powered hubs"" aren't truly powered and cause usb disconnects and all kinds of issues. This hub has been perfect so far. I have 7 peripherals connected at almost all times including multiple iPhones and iPod touches, and don't have any usb disconnect or power issues.I recommend this usb hub!*Update (6/14/2009) - I have now purchased two of these, and still love them. Highly recommended."
1,internittent issues on dell laptop/vista,"i have a printer, ipod, iphone, wireless keyboard/mouse on plugged in to mine, while it's also on the AC power.this port is very spotty - works great sometimes, other times not at all. i consistently lose my wireless keyboard/mouse until i plug them in to a USB on my laptop.when i plug in my iphone, i also get popup warnings that 'this device could be faster' asking me to plug the phone in to a usb 2.0 hi-speed port.not sure if there's anything better out there, but this one definitely isn't cutting it."
1,Review at 3 months use,"I purchased the hub 3 months ago, not realizing that it would have a short life. In recent weeks devices - among others, an ink jet printer and a palm pilot cradle - served by the hub have begun to ""malfunction.""I discovered that the devices are ok but the hub is not doing its job.Hoping your experience is better than mine after 3 months.: (David"
1,Battle for Middle Earth II,"Game was new, We just can't play it due to having the wrong components in our computer. Please don't hold ""star"" rating against seller. VERY prompt delivery. Game was what they said it was. We are happy with the Amazon store that sent it. Thanks BG"
5,Works as advertised,"I got exactly what i paid for and am glad it works. At first it didn't work, but i got it cleaned and works great"
3,Advanced resolution stereo a little dissapointing,"I think i was just expecting too much.The album is still fantastic to listen to, but at first it was not clear what the ""dual"" disc would deliver.I hoped for a multichannel version of the normal CD, but it was only ""enhanced"" stereo.In what way it is enhanced? I wouldn't know.. My amplifier normally states if it is 96 or 192Khz but in this case it didn't gave a clue on what bitrate the DVD side was recorded..Shame, as i really enjoyed many (multichannel) DVD-A's and SACD on my system."
1,Another copy proteted cd I will not be buying.,"I like David Gray, I would like to buy this cd and listen to it how and where I want to but I can't because it is copy protected so I will not be buying this or any other similarly protected cd. Can't get it on my iPod, can't play it on my Sonos. Sorry David you lost a sale. It's not your fault, it is the fault of your record distributor. If they ever come to their senses I will be first in line to buy."
1,Boycott Copy Protection,"I was going to buy this CD the other day in Best Buy but I thought I would listen to a few tracks and check out the reviews on Amazon first and I sure am glad I did. I have had a couple of close calls with buying CD's with copy protection which is to say that once I find out the artist has allowd their company to do this to their CD's I do not buy them. I have over 1000 CD's and do not mind supporting artists, but I refuse to pay for a product and then be told when, where, and how I can use it. This is essentually what companies like Sony is doing and since I can't change their policies I choose to boycott this practice. I also have an IPod and take it with me all over and if a CD won't allow me to put it on my computer hard drive and on my IPod then it is of no use to me. Now I can add this artist to my list of do not buys."
4,It's a dark life...,"It seems that David Gray's life has changed for the worse. At least that's what it semms from his music. Life In Slow Motion is an utter heartache.From the forlorn opener Alibi to the current single The One I Love, Gray displays a kind of helplessness that builds around love. The album the culminates to a high in the middle with the title track Slow Motion,From Here You Can Almost See The Sea and Ain;t No Love, the trilogy of songs that express the unexpressed of a draggy life, of unrequited love and of being unloved. The songs are often heavy-hearted, interspersed with one or two more uplifting tracks in between before closing with yet another pair of poignant tracks, the beautiful Now and Always and the aching Disappearing World.The dualdisc features the album in 5.1 stereo on the DVD side as well as a short documentary on the making of the album plus photographs. Nice little extras but not essential. Get the normal edition if youcan do without these."
5,Great CD,I love this CD and every song that is on the CD!! David Gray is not sold at Target stores in my area. To find the time to track a Borders or a Barnes and Knoble that sells CD's is too much of my time wasted in my day. So I went to Amazon.com and ordered the CD on a Thursday night. I selected standard shipping and received my CD on Monday. I am planning on purchasing more of his CD's and will do so on Amazon.com.
2,David Gray,"David Gray's newest release Life in Slow Motion is just that, Slow. I found it to be nice, pretty music, but it was way too slow for my liking.It also was not that memorable of an album. After a listen, I could not look at the track listing and sing any memorable choruses. It just didn't really impress me that much.The music itself is pretty and beautiful and he's got a great voice, but the album just isn't that special. It lack that extra something that made White Ladder such a wonderful album."
1,"If I could listen on my iPod, I might bother to be a fan","I was given this as a gift, told I would *LOVE* it, and couldn't wait to get it home and into my iPod's music rotation. Unfortunately, SonyBMG has made that ""unauthorized"". Imagine that...they've taken a device with a major share of the market and deemed it unauthorized. It seems that should be illegal, doesn't it?I have thousands of artists to choose from...I can live without David Grays' music if Sony continues to try and strongarm me into supporting it's business partners. Buying this CD should NOT obligate me to use .wmf files or rely on Microsoft's MusicMatch Jukebox.I might have been a fan, but I'm not going to go through any trouble."
4,"Not ""White Ladder,"" but better than ""A New Day at Midnight""","David Gray has toned down the rockier side of his sound since his early work (e.g. ""Sell, Sell, Sell""), but the electronica merged with what is essentially folk-pop music is most welcome on ""Life In Slow Motion."" The album's first cut, ""Alibi"" emerges from the depths of heartache and loss. Other tracks, such as ""The One I Love"" and ""Hospital Food"" have great hooks in the way that is reminiscent of classics like ""Babylon"" and ""Sail Away. Lyrically, this album is a return to Gray's poetic form, particularly on ""Lately"" and ""From Here You Can Almost See the Sea."""
1,Not much help,I found the first SOCOM book very helpful and worth the money. This guide for the second game is not as helpful. I doubt the writers actually played the game. You buy these books to learn how to get past the places everybody gets stuck. This book doesn't address these situations at all.
1,Are you Serious,"This is by far the worst Strategy Guide i have ever purchased or even looked through. I have already beat the single player mode and just looking through the single player guide section, i do not belive that would of helped with the single player game. The reason i did buy this was for the ONLINE play. The ""quote"" map guides of all 22 maps are bogus. They do not show one picture of online maps at all and the the info it gives would get you killed in a heart beat. and for the WEapons it gives you picture and name, no info on them. THIS IS A D-. do not buy unless you need this paper for fire, because it is useless."
4,Replacing an old standby,"I have always liked the rock-n-roll of Bryan Adams. I am updating music that has disppeared over the years and with each play, oh the memories."
5,Fantastic AF Gold Disc,"Another outstanding AF Gold release. The warmth of the songs are right in line with my LP. Zero compression and and smooth bass - much better than the ""thin"" original disc. Cuts Like A Knife is a perfect example of what should be done with classic discs."
3,Okay but not Great,"Have been trying to find a replacement for the moisturizer I've used for so long..unfortunately it has been discontinued. However, this was recommended by the maker/manufacturer and it is a poor replacement. I'm very disappointed."
4,What an impact,I have owned the cordless impact wrench now for some time and I love it and use it often. It isn't your brute force impact wrench so if you want to take off badly rusted nuts forget it. I keep it in the car trunk for changing tires but have used it for many things and it works flawlessly. Works best when completely charged. I highly recommend it if you know the limitations. Great tool.
4,Computer Confluence,"Very straight-forward and easy to understand book on Computer Essentials (end-user computing).In my lectures in Information Systems, beginners, it was a handy reference."
4,Finally something worthy of the ds lite!,"I was quite pleased that they have created such nice skins for the ds lite. I love the Surfer Girl skin! it compliments the ds whether it is the white or the new Onyx. I only have one complaint...it is toofragile. As all ds lite accessories always are! you have to be sure to apply it the first time properly, if not the top part of the cover skin falls off and the whole thing is ruined. I ended up happening to use a light (safe) adhesive to place it back on. All in all it is a great looking skin. Unfortunately it is hard to find. I found mine at circuit city for two dollars cheaper."
2,Totally Absurd,"I found the premise of this movie extremely unbelievable. The whole idea of the FBI doing this, or handling the case of Buddy Aces in such a manner was totally absurd. Further, that the mob would put a hit out in such a fashion as this is counter-intuitive. Nowadays though you have to be willing to sacrifice reality in order to enjoy yourself at the movies, but Smokin' Aces crosses the line in my view. The plot is videogamesesque. The acting was not a problem with the exception of Ryan Reynolds who was just awful as the (semi) main character. His Agent Messner was a serious drama queen and difficult to watch. As for Ray Liotta, why can't he find stronger films? He's capable of much better rolls than this one."
1,Please enter a title for your review,The amount of veiled references to past events that haven't been explained of depicted in the film leaves most scenes devoid of context. For every question the plot answers three more are raised and it ends with about 100 left unanswered. I learnt more about the plot from reading the amazon editorial review than I did from watching the film.
4,"""Way Past Words"" ~ Prostitutes, Perverts, Psychos & Professionals of the Murderous Kind","`Smokin' Aces' released on DVD in '07 is the next step in the evolution of madness and mayhem begun by the '94 cult classic `Pulp Fiction' and redefined in '03 with `Kill Bill.' Like the two previously mentioned films ""Smokin' Aces' presents a display of outlandish, wacked out ""bad guys"" and hard nosed, amoral ""good guys"" that will keep you riveted to the screen. The action is fast and furious, the bloodshed plentiful and the plot turns will keep you wondering where this film is taking you until the very end.This movie is definitely not for everyone [especially children] but if you like this genre of film you'll love this one!"
3,Smokin' Aces,Funny but not what I was expecting. This movie is slow and does not hold your attention.
3,Crashed my XA2,"I find it to be unfortunate for buyers of this media to be forced into quality checking what should've been checked by the manufacturer prior to release. I was enjoying the movie prior to this disc locking up my player to the point of having to turning the player off then back on to reset. YES my player works with other discs, tested that. I own both Toshiba HD-DVD XA2 and Sony BDP-S300 Bluray players, Universal cannot afford quality control issues to keep pace with the competition!"
5,happy 6 yr old customer,"This game is awsome! there is a sink by the door that can open, there is a two-sided wall, one in the chamber of secrets, and on the other side are the halls. The Basilisk will roar when you pull its tail. I don't have the Harry Potter figure yet, but I usually use the sword by itself. If you want it to be cool you can open its mouth and put the sword under its tounge, and then you pull its tail and it falls to the floor. There are two holders that hold the two-sided wall. It's so good!"
5,Great PSU,"After 2 failures in finding a power supply to power my new Athlon64 rig, I settled on this Antec PSU. I haven't regretted it. It is very quiet, and provides good steady power that 'lesser' (read that: 550 watt) PSU's failed to provide."
3,out dated info,the book is charming in a retro way but there is so much misinformation that the publisher had to add a whole page in the very back showing the corrections on the dated info. I was not paying attention when I ordered it and I'm not sure it said it was printed in 1959 so I really can't blame anyone but myself. My granddaughters are going to London and I thought this would be a fun book to read. The seller delivered it very promptly and it is a very nice quality book.
4,pretty nice,"this isn't a bad movie the fight choreography is very 70's style but with a heavyness to it, its still a good movie"
5,one of the best,"installed last year , working 24hr/7d around the clock , no noise and no problems.recommanded."
2,"Warning: Not much Paolo Conte - lots of ""Friends""...","Only four (out of twelve!) tracks featuring Paolo Conte - playing the vibraphone with the ""Doctor Dixie Jazz Band"". Nice hot jazz music, Woody Allen style, but not at all a ""Paolo Conte"" record as title and cover suggest."
4,Marc'll grab your soul away...,"For all ye unbelievers who thought it could never get better than Soft Cell, (myself once included)this should well, teach thee proper worship! Its nothing but plain hard disliking this work for its all there; from the intoxicating arabian melody of Caged to the pure energied dance beats of Adored & Explored and Shining Brightly. Even after you take away the really slow, capturing numbers like Child Star and The Edge of Heartbreak, you're still left with the task of picking out your favourite song for in sooth, every mood you're in I feel theres a song to match on this album. And gosh, his fascination with the macabre in love never fails to creep up and choke you while you're enjoying it. His versatility & lyrical abilities bleed through on this album and that'll get you even if the music doesn't."
3,"Love Zola, but Didn't Enjoy La Terre","I am a huge Emile Zola fan and have read most of his novels. La Terre is without a doubt my least favorite Zola novel. The book is well written, of course, but I didn't like the characters or the story. Having read a lot of Zola, I wasn't shocked by the depiction of the coarse, greedy peasants, but I grew weary of the story after a short while, and had to struggle to finish the book. For whatever reason, I just didn't care what was going to happen on the next page. I never felt like the story was building up to an ending that I cared about. My advice is to read lots of Zola, but to put ""La Terre"" somewhere toward the bottom of your Zola reading list."
4,Helpful book,This book is helpful to get a picture of the interior details of building a house. Very informational and good for reference.
3,Iris Pen Executive,"I found the orignal Iris Pen II under Windows 2000 far superior to the Iris Pen Executive under Microsoft XP. Both the Iris Pen II and this new design does not integrate as well with Microsoft XP. Aligning the executive type pen with the text is far more difficult than with the II-type pen. The device does function and is faster than typing. However, the performance of the product has degraded under the XP operating system."
2,Not impressed!,"I have yet to get this pen to scan one complete, readable sentence and believe me I have tried. I tried calibrating it on different shades of white paper to see if that helped but to no avail. The only thing it would scan reasonably well was the instruction booklet that came with the pen. Go figure! Iris support tells me to calibrate and practice but I learned to play guitar faster than I have learned to use this scanner!"
5,these are great,"These items that you go through in a hurry are great to add to your list to get your free shipping offers! I use these for my very large dog and she goes through them very fast, so, as usual, Amazon offers everything you could need and if not cheaper than usual which they usually are, they at least cost the same and help you get your free shipping. I got them in a reasonable amount of time and was ready when the last ones were gone! Thanks for these opportunities to stay home and get my favorite items shipped right to my door. That way I don't run out. Flo"
4,Pitty Loves them,"Our 70lb Pit loves these. Got the large size. Sometimes they last a week, but sometimes he gets them out in 10 minutes. Not sure if they have changed the sizing because they used to be close to impossible for me to get into the ball, and they lasted a long long time for him. Now they are easy for me to get into the ball, and only last about 10 minutes for him."
2,Made in China,"My dog loved this toy/treat, and then I noticed in the fine print on the cardboard it came in that it was made in China. While my dog has consumed 2-1/2 of these treats with no adverse effects, I cannot continue to buy them because of the concern that I might get a bad batch that will make her sick. I'm disappointed and so is my dog."
2,not so everlasting,"my german shepherd went thru this in less than 20 mins. I was very disappointed. Everlasting must be a good tasting treat, or perhaps a smaller dog could make it last longer? who knows for sure. So, although I personally didn't taste this, my german shepherd plowed thru in record time."
1,Not exactly Zahn-quality,"Not exactly the most exciting SW novel. Also, bringing alive a plague that's been dead for a couple thousand years or whatever years? Barbra Hambly has been able to make me never want to visit Nam Chorios. I won't spoil the callista matter for you, but there isn't much to spoil. I only finished it because of my complete devotion to everything that has to do with star wars."
2,I should have know better,"After reading Children of the Jedi I should have known better than to read this one. The pacing was horrible. Would of literally burned the three books in the ""Callista"" trilogy if it wasn't for Darksaber because Kevin J Anderson understands how a Star wars book should flow. Barbara Hambly just didn't seem to know what to do with the universe she was trying to write in."
1,What happened to Barbra Hambley's writing skills?!,"I really enjoyed Children of the Jedi. I found it very interesting. SO WHAT HAPPENED!? Planet of Twilight was creepy and gross. What's up with that drach thing? I would not recommend this book to anyone but die hard fans, and only then because it is still a Star Wars book. Just not a good one. If she writes any more Star Wars books, they just better not include drachs."
2,Hambly Screws Up Again!!,"This book was just like her other one...she trys to make it more interesting but fails utterly. I disagree with the review that ddeboe@juno.com said about the difference in writing style. The truth is: SHE DOESN'T KNOW HOW TO WRITE A SW BOOK! And if ddeboe was hinting that Kevin Anderson is not a good writer than he/she doesn't know SW from Star Trek. She portrays Luke Skywalker as someone that has just learned to use the Force. I should know, I have read over 30 SW books and most were good. But Barbara Hambly is the most distinquishable black sheep of the flock. From my stand point, she should be removed from the SW writers' list and put in some other writer. The only reason that i gave it 2 stars was that the plot was well built and Leia finally has begun to use the Force. Overall, if you can avoid buying it, do so and borrow it from someone or the library. This is a really boring book that drags out for a long time. But think about what you like."
2,Star Wars?,"The story itself was tolereable if you could get past the bore of an opening long enough to realize this was a Star Wars Novel. One word for Barbara Hambly: WIT. Star Wars characters are witty. That's part of their appeal. One more thing, we should have dropped Callista off in Darksaber."
2,A lackluster book written by an author out of her element,"I'd like to start by saying that I've read more than 25 of the Star Wars novels. This is one of the worst. Barbara Hambly is clearly not an SF writer. I found this book to be boring and downright annoying at times.As an example, she just keeps making up words. Now I realize that in order to write about other planets one must give names to the objects being described. That's all well and good. The problem is that she tends to go on for PAGES, just making up words as she goes along. Parts of this book read like a Dr Seuss book! Had it not been a Star Wars novel, I'd have thrown it into the fire.In essence, read it if you're a big Star Wars fan. If you're not, or are looking for a good intro to the Star Wars universe of novels, start elsewhere."
1,I WOULD RATHER **** LEAD THAN READ THIS PATHETIC BOOK,"This is the worst book I have ever read, ever seen or ever heard. Quite simply Hambly watches to much Star Trek. The book gives Star Wars a bad name almost as if Star Wars was a movie made to sacrifice human souls for Satan. The only good thing it has done for me is put me to sleep."
3,Could be worse.,"I like the way Barbara gets us close to the characters, especially Luke and Leia (if not Han). Being stranded on a mostly barren planet for a whole novel is kind of different, but the author keeps my interest, none the less. Although this is another in a series that more or less ignores that Leia is President, that she and Han have children, and that Luke runs an Academy, it's a good read for those tired of all-encompasing battles for the galaxy."
2,When will the hurting stop?,"Please don't plunk down your hard earned money for this. The action sequences (when there were any) were terrible. The plot was pretty improbable, but occasionally I found the plot to be half way decent, kind of like those old B movies. The problem was that some of the characters acted inconsistently, or they failed to act in character. Leia in particular bothered me, she was incredibly indecisive. The way characters interacted was also questionable, and the dialoges were often iffy. Buy The Courtship of Princess Leia, or Heir to the Empire instead."
4,Melody Calls,"'Lost Souls' is a very promising debut album that has a very intense emotional feel to it. The obvious stand-out tracks are the 2 singles 'The Cedar Room' and 'Here It Comes'. Doves are very similar to Shack in that they write melodic, accoustic, pop. If you are looking for the most promising debut album of 2000, you've found it."
2,Don't believe the other reviews,"Now, what ever made me think that I would even like this album?? Perhaps because the 'similar artists' list sounded good to me. Well, if you find yourself in the same boat that I was in and are considering giving this band a shot, don't bother. The songs are way too long and way too unpretentious and Boring. Very, very boring. In fact, this cd annoyed me. It's strange... I can sense that the band HAS potential, but it sounds to me that they just don't know how to capture it. This album is missing something. It's almost as though they are trying too hard. It sounds contrived and unnatural. In fact, I've already traded it away. 24hours of this cd was enough."
2,Good Idea: But I'm disappointed,"This really looked like a good idea. A small,portable,nice-looking speaker system for my Sansa. I'm disappointed though because even though they are small, I still expected more volume than these offered. If you are in a room with any kind of ambient sound -- forget it. I can't use it with my plastic Sansa protector on either, I have to remove it. Also, the sound is distorted at (it's) high volume setting. These would be okay in a small, quiet room at a close proximity to the listener (especially for the spoken word). Other than that it's value is limited."
1,terrible book,"This book was horrendous to follow. The stories might have been interesting, but there was obviously no proofreading done. Paragraphs were interrupted by strange symbols and paragraphssometimesflowed likethis.I gave up on this book. What a waste of money."
3,I can make better ones myself,"These are atually better then the ""liners"" of the same brand. They're cheap, and abosorb quite a bit, they're just small, I have to pair them with something else, and my 1 year old is not a heavy wetter. I can make better ones myself."
4,Overall good sockets,"Sockets hold up very well with standard use, but after 2 months of use with the 9/16"" socket on my 450 ft/lbs torque 3/8"" snap-on impact I split the the case in three sections. However I emailed I.R. and they said to send it in and they'd send me a replacement under warranty. Another minor problem I have is the labeling is mearly painted ""laser etched"" on and comes off when you rub the socket on something.All in all a great set for the DIY weekend warriors, but if you're going to be stressing these sockets out everyday I'd recommend buying the $120 8 piece set off the snap-on or matco truck."
1,The pic is very misleading,"The bracelet I got have scatches everywhere. Not shiny at all.If that's the way it's supposed to be, please use another picture. Very misleading."
3,I'd change a few things...,"I like the saying on this bracelet, I wish it had a different way of putting it on, a clasp of some sort or one of those rings w/ the bar. It has elastic in it to expand the bracelet... which makes it feel really cheap and I get nervour it will break."
5,I Loved It,"Let Go of Yesterday, Dream of Tomorrow, Work on Today Sun Charm Silver Tone Stretch Bangle BraceletI got this bracelet for my friend as a Christmas present(which means she hasn't seen it yet) because she's been verydepressed about her past and so I wanted to bring some positivityto her life. Mine just came in perfect condition... the sun charmstayed on and no scratches were to be found. It wasn't as shinyas it looked on the monitor but I couldn't care less.I was fighting not to keep it for myself since I bought it as a gift.I really like it:D Thank you for great item."
5,Smooth Operator,Mary Kay Dual Coverage Powder provides a smooth moderate coverage when used dry (as I do)without shimmer. It is easy to apply and touch up (touch ups required) and if you can find the compact online it looks beautiful in your purse and in your hand ;)Check me out at [...] and although the photo is Photo Shopped you can get an idea of the color and finish.
1,"Willy who? I thought this was about baseball, not a play...","Has anyone even heard of ""Death of a Salesman?"" I know I haven't. I thought Willie Lowman was a baseball player. Or if he wasn't a baseball player, I knew he had to be one of Robin Hood's Merry Men. What a dumb book. I like baseball and anyone who shoots bows and arrows. Huh!"
1,The Death Of A Salesman is not all its cracked up to be!!,"I found that the Death Of a Salesman is one of the most boring plays that i have ever read. Maybe its a piece of art to all those who study literature, but to myself, all my peers and to those who studied it in Year 11 english like i did, think that it is the most boring play that i have ever come across. It really has nothin to do with lifestyles in the 90's, and therefore will not interest those like myself. The play is stupid and confusing, and iam sorry if i have offended anyone who thinks that this is a piece of art. But iam only saying what i think, and iam free to do so."
5,An invaluable resource for anyone with struggling students!,"Not only have I read and used the strategies suggested in this book, my classroom research is reported in it. What makes this information so invaluable is that it is immediately useable. Any teacher or parent with a struggling student can work with that student to capitalize on strenghts and take the anxiety out of the writing process. Students will quickly realize feelings of success and accomplishment. The case studies presented clarify the concepts and demonstrate their effectiveness. Teachers across grade levels and subject areas will be sorry they haven't been utilizing writing strategy instruction all along!"
4,Nothing new,"The exercises are nothing new. The key to this exercise programme is how it`s put together. The circuit routine is awesome for burning fat.Sometimes you need reminding of certain things.Granted there is a lot of hype -but in this case it is justified, Combat Conditioning is unbeatable for fast weight loss & getting you in shape in minimum time. In @ 15 minutes I work every muscle in my body and have the rest of the day to get on with my hectic life. It is quick ,very effective, and requires no equipment- everything an exercise programme should be. Combined with Navy Seal calisthenics this will really get you in shape fast."
1,Avoid...,"Long story short, avoid this lens. I went through two copies in two weeks. Both had focus errors on my Mark IIn and my brother 40D.Sorry, just not worth it."
4,Good exercises,"I like the exercises on this video. The lady that leads them is a little weird, though. Sometimes it sounds like she isn't sure what she's talking about. I would have liked to have seen ahead of time that I would need certain equipment in order to participate in all the workouts, like a strength band, a medicine ball, what size weights, etc. Over all, though, it's a really good work out."
2,Extreme Yawn,"Kreator fans will probably want to kill me for hating Extreme Aggression. Unfortunenatly, there were only a hand full of good songs. The Album starts out by picking you up real high with their bad a** title track, Extreme Aggression. And then pritty much drops you to the floor from there. Some Pain Will Last, will leave you breathless with the genius Kreator expresses in the opening of the song. And Extreme Aggression's solo will tear you a new cornholio. You can buy this album, but I don't recomend it. I'm going to still keep mine because I really only liked the first couple of songs. After that I just have to turn it off. You should at least buy it for those songs and the fact that its Kreator."
2,Very short-lived fun,"The product is ok for what it is. Just don't have any great expectations. Its the kind of toy that my 5-yr-old nephew played with for like 15 mins and then he's never picked it up again...although he really enjoyed it for those 15-mins. So, overall, I would not recommend it."
5,Nice surprise from BBB,Bad Boys Blue made this album pretty well. All songs are in Bad Boys Blue style - greate dance melodies and love lyrics.
4,Sleek and Compact,"This is great for the older child. It is sleek and compact and holds everything you need to travel with. Older kids don't like th ebig bulky packpack type carriers (like for the L-Max, even though it's smaller than most). This case can fit into a backpack, duffel or tote bag, whatever your child carries. One great thing for me is that it doesn't ""junk up"" my car. it seems the kids all have tons of stuff to take with them everywhere they go and this really helps keep my daughter (and her stuff) organized. For $10, it holds a lot of valuables!"
5,A MUST for the pen,If you have the Fly Pen you will want to buy this case for it. The pen tip can become messed up from carrying around in bookbags or general. The case is nice and sturdy. Over all good Product.
3,A little disappointed,"I bought a set of six of the platinum ice tea stems. I don't know what I expected for $12.99 a stem, but I was disappointed. They appear to be more like hard plastic, although they are glass. I decided to keep them anyway."
5,Hey I loved it,"Okay I read the other review and had to add my opinion.I loved the series, it's from stem the stern the best series I've read this year.The other guy had a point about how it'd be cooler if the technology had continued to advance with centers assistance (david, s.m.? can you hear us?)But the fact is that the story is compelling, the characters well written and frankly is just a really fun read from stem to stern my biggest complaint is that the series is ended already.I'd love to see more books, with more interesting technological advancement using centers resources. I'd like to see what popinlach and raj make in a few years...and say a colony rebellion...but the books rocked. all of them.. the ""sequel"" the choson, was only about 75% as good but still worth reading..."
2,A poor conclusion,"About 1/3 of the way through this book, the authors depart from the historical model they have so carefully followed, and start skipping though time much more quickly, as if anxious to be done with the series. Also, perhaps a quarter of the text is flashbacks that are taken word-for-word from previous volumes in the series. This is really a bit much. The final solution is obvious, and if it is possible at this point, why wasn't it possible 2-3 books ago? This is a poor conclusion to the series, IMO."
5,Getting Fit.....This worked for me,"A lawyer friend challenged me to take the fitness test by seeing how far I could run/walk in 12 minutes.I just scraped into the 'poor' categoryHe gave me my original copy of Kenneth Coopers, 'Aerobics'which I passed around friends and yes, I lost track of it and have since obtained another copy through Amazon.I selected the running program which I discovered to be so accurate in estimating my progress. On my first day I walked 1 mile in 6 minutes over the target which meant I had to walk faster.Then each week, I managed to reach further targets (utterly exhausted after the run to make the target)I was amazed that after 7 weeks I was covering the mile in under 7 minutes and lost 15 kilos and reduced my belt size to 36 inches.I was 'jumping out of my skin' I felt so good.Of particular interest I found that if I consumed a few glasses of wine the night before my run, I would lose up to 15 seconds from my anticipated goal. Dont hesitate, get a copy and live longer"
5,Necessary Reading,"Isaac Bonewits broad understanding of all the Pagan paths combined with his scholarship in the dynamics of worship makes this a unique treasure. It is a must-have for anyone leading,, planning or organizing ritual for groups. I have even recommended it to my friends who plan ceremonies i main-line religious traditions."
5,"A palate-pleasing, idea filled book","This book is a wonderful addition to any kitchen library. I originally received a basket of the mixes as a gift. Especially good were the brownies and biscotti. I asked for the recipes and was treated with not only another basket of mixes but this book too!! What a treat. I now am giving these goodies as gifts too. Everyone loves these easy to prepare, delectable treats."
5,"Great gift ideas for teachers, friends, gift basket business",I checked this out of the library but I wanted to copy 90% of the recipes and I knew I had to buy it. Great presentation ideas also.
2,Unfortunately not the last bed I'll buy,"Like most of you looking here, I've gone through more beds for my dogs than I can remember. Last year after the cheap bed was tossed out I decided maybe I just need to spend a little more for quality. My local store had the Big Shrimpy and convinced by the initial quality and the shop owner that this would last forever, I ordered one each for my 2 dogs at close to $400 out the door...It took my 2 labs no more than 6 months to completely flatten out the beds and so far my email to the manufacturer has gone unanswered.In short, this is not the one... the search must go on."
2,Rick didn't want it!,"According to RWs own website, he states that these recordings were taken without his authorization, and that lyrics were added without his approval. He didn't do it! RW's work is great, but the lyrics are not."
3,Not really a review,"If you're all Wakeman fans, I'm looking for the original White Rock recording in any format. I notice there is a White Rock II. If anyone knows where I can get one, let me know."
1,Expensive piece of garbage!,"After years of cheap irons, I decided to splurge and buy the best. I am so sorry now that I did! I thought Rowenta was the top of the line when it came to irons. I iron very little but after having this iron about a year, now it won't turn on. It is designed to turn off if it is not placed horizontally for a certain period of time. Something must be wrong with that switch because now it will not turn on at all. The light is on but nobody's home. As I said, I iron very little so I know that I haven't worn it out. Sending it off for repairs just sounds like a lot of expense. Excuse me...I don't have time to write anymore. I have to go pick up a cheap iron. At least when it dies, I won't feel cheated."
2,Disappointed,"Like many others, I thought Rowenta was THE brand of iron to get and maybe it was in the past. However, I've been disappointed with mine. It began to stream water after I had owned it a few months. I tried changing water, using the self-clean function, letting it heat up for several minutes - everything recommended in the owner's manual. It still trails water unpredictably over my clothes. I've noticed that several of the Rowenta irons on amazon's website have the same problem and I am most disappointed in the fact that the company has allowed the problem to continue. I'll go with another brand next time."
2,Not worth it....,"You're better off with the U.S. maxi CD....BELIEVE ME! This one contains the Deep Dish Mix and some Groove Armada mixes. You can get all of these mixes on the U.S. release (except for the GA edit and beats, which are pretty bland), and it's cheaper! And the vido portion of this is AWFUL. The video has been censored to the highest extreme, and very sloppily, I might add. It wasn't worth putting on here if they were going to mess it up like that. I don't know about you, but I don't like seeing big blurry blobs in my videos! If you're going to edit a video, be subtle about it!!!!"
5,a Book of the Year candidate!,Here is an intriguing very different subject which those wanting A+ category romances can turn to. It is a book that lives up to Kathryn Shay's first book (which I notice Amazon does not list?) THE FATHER FACTOR = a Harlequin Superromance # 659 1995 which is a 10 IMHO.
2,"Disappointed, but still a FAN","I, like so many others was disappointed in this book. I have all of Jude's books and have reread all of them. This is not one I will ever read again. I have never given one of her books so low a rating. I had know idea of what James was thinking though out the book, until the ending, which I couldn't believe. What a major disappointment. I also kept reading thinking somewhere Jude's normal style of writing was coming up soon. Did someone else write this book for her?"
4,Enjoyable Story,"I enjoyed this book. I think I can agree that there weren't as many truly romantic scenes, but I disagree with those that feel that the book totally lacked romance. What it works out to is a happy medium in the romance department and an all-around good read.Temperance is a great leading female character and for once I was happy with a heroine's reaction to her hero's past (current?) lover. James will not win an award for best hero, but Temperance more than makes up for his shortcomings.If you're a fan of Jude Deveraux, you will enjoy this book."
2,Temptation,"I was extremely disappointed in Jude's most recent endeavor, I should have borrowed it not bought it. The characters and story where flat, boring and self-centered. Over the last few years the author's quality of story telling has declined, the last really good book by her was Sweet Liar. However, I did buy this book because she seemed to have recaptured some of her wonderful ability in High Tide and I had hoped that the trend would continue. I'll read the next one out, but I'll wait to borrow it or buy it at tag sale."
5,Inspiring story about an ongoing struggle,This story is about the struggles of a gay coach but the type of predjudice doesn't matter. Gumby fought a battle for himself and his team. The team members and coach Gumby are better off because of it. The book was very inspiring and worth every penny. I would recommend it to anyone to read. It brings out the good and bad in people.
2,Big Let Down,"For all us Lammle lovers, who passed the CCNA with his book, this book turns out to be a serious let down. I passed my CCNA reading Todd Lammle is book and didn't have second thoughts buying this product for CCNP. I was in for a big surprise, I realize that Todd, has a tendency to over simplify the stuff for beginners and therefore was better suited to write for CCNA. Not only there are typos in this book but it also lacks in depth explanation and has little insight to any topic covered."
2,Not up to Mr. Lammle's standards,"Unlike the CCNA book published by the same author, the Sybex CCNP Routing book was not helpful in preparing for the Cisco exam. The book had an abundance of errors, especially relating to BGP (Chapters 7,8,9). The book also skimmed over EIGRP, which was covered heavily in the exam."
5,Excellent Study Guides,"I have used these books for two of my Cisco exams, and can honestly say that they really, really are worth every penny. The way that Todd writes such heavily technical material is wonderful. They're easy to read, easy to understand, thorough, and cover everything you need to know to pass! He has a style that is unique, and makes it easy to remember such complex content. I will buy all his study guides for my Cisco path!"
2,This study guide alone is not enough,"I have studied this book carefully and I found the book lacking in the materials that were tested on the exam. In fact, some of the exam questions were totally unfamiliar -- as a result I BARELY passed. Yes, the routing exam is more difficult in the CCNP cert. --- all the more reason for the author to expand on the subjects covered and, more importantly, to explain them better. Also, how about adding materials that were covered on the exam that were not covered or even mentioned in the book??"
2,Helpful reference but no exam prep.,"I studied this book from head to cover. The book is easy to digest & is pretty consistent with the BSCN course that I took, with respect to the terminology & commands. However, this guide fell far short of preparing me adequately for the 640-503 exam. If you want a quick easy reference to Cisco's ""Routing"" concepts, Buy the book, however if you're looking for material & practice questions to produce succesful exam results, I recommend something with more detail."
2,Just don't like.,"I used the Cisco Press Exam Certification Guide series to pass the CCNP exams. I got this one and I just don't like the higher level, skimming topics writing style. I'm not saying that I always understand the lower level stuff at first read, but I like the option of trying. The chapters I read of this book seem to offer not much more than high level topic summaries. The high number of typos bug too."
3,Starts off good.,This book is very much below Todd Lammle. I think he needs to start taking more time with his books.It seems that writers of this book know alot about Cisco and OSPF but only know what they have read about EIGRP and BGP. I say that because the BGP section is very hard to read and follow. It seems that they are just trying to get the information out as quick as possible. There are a few mistakes in the information and Diagrams.This is a good book for reference but I would have used something else to study with if I had known.
1,one song,this is a one song albumI am doctor u all know it its on every drive-thru sample CDbut be careful!!!!!!!! because that is the ONLY song they have!!
2,Glue or Uncooked,"I bought this and a few other Annie Chun products on the recomendation of a Trader Joe's worker. Annie's signature Soba noodles can be cooked to either an unappealing glue or still hard inside. The sauce has an unpleasent odor, my fiancee would not even try it. I went ahead and tried it but couldn't finish it. I think I'm being generous with 2 Stars, seeing as how my dogs wouldn't eat it either."
2,not for indoor use,My dog loved the treat but I now have stains all over my house from the product. I recommend that this be used only outdoors.
4,My dog loves these treats!!,I have a golden retriever who loves these treats and they are a good chewing alternative since she has started having some anxiety when left alone. They last longer when placed in the treat balls but it can be a pain to get them into the ball so I have given them outside the ball as well. Like I said doesn't last as long but still keeps her busy for a few hours. If you don't have a power chewer it should last longer but a few hours is the max around here. My dog enjoys the different flavors and she rarely puts it down until she has finished it!
3,My picky doxie turned up his nose at these!,"I'm sure these would be great for a larger dog, my doxie couldn't get them out of the ball nor could he really chew on them. When I tried to give him the treat alone he turned up his nose at it."
3,Everlasting...Not Hardly,"I will admit, all four of my dogs loved these. All the flavors, but, I gave it three stars because of the Everlasting being more like, Neverlasting. All four dogs, the strong chewers and the two that aren't, finished them within 10 minutes.Such a short amount of ""chewing"" time, does not justify the price being charged. Sorry, but I'll spend my $$$ on tendons or moo tubes..."
4,"I don't care for the taste, but the dogs sure seem to like it","The Everlasting Treats are to be used together with the Everlasting Treat Ball. (Follow the instructions on how to insert them. Some of the reviewers had problems with this and the results were not optimal.)My son has a dachshund that devours slippers like they were after-dinner mints and a Corgie that can inhale a sofa leg in under a minute. These dogs are serious chewers. Nothing satisfied their chewing needs until we found this.The name, Everlasting Treats, is a bit of a hyperbole. However, it kept my son's dogs quiet and occupied for up to several days. (Conversely, my own dogs who are not chewers had absolutely no interest in this product. )The dogs are happy and my son's blood pressure is now down at normal levels."
5,World's greatest treats,"These are the greatest, keep your dog happy and occupied treats. My dogs range in size from 9 lbs to 120 lbs and they both love these. I get the large size treat ball and even the little guy can carry it around and chew on it. My dogs are so crazy about this toy that I've given them as presents to friends dogs.StarMark Everlasting Treat Ball, Large"
4,Dog loves them,"My dog absolutely loves these treats. I have a Bento ball I put them in and he goes to town. Everlasting is a HUGE HUGE HUGE overstatement. If I didn't put these in the ball upside down like someone else suggested, they'd be gone in minutes. I can get a couples sessions out of one if I put it in upside down, which isn't too terribly hard if you have a set of needle nosed pliers. These treats are rather expensive, and for as long as they last, it's hard to justify the cost, but when I find them on sale I buy them, because my pup thinks they are fantastic."
1,something in this makes her sick,maybe too much glycerine in this product. also once she gets it out of the holder (everlasting treat holder) she can chomp the whole thing quickly. but the worse part is...she gets diarrhea. Hershey squirts often starting a few hours after digestion of this treat. she likes it but it is not good for her.
2,If 'everlasting' means less than 20 minutes...,"must have been tasty though, because that's how long it took my lab to destroy this. I would not buy this again."
2,Not a Smooth Transition,"It is best to leave the mush mush to the Chopras and Johars of the world and comedy to Anees Bazmees and Raju Hiranis. They have done it so often that their seasoning in the genres is so perfect that they almost give the law of diminishing marginal utility a run for its money. Now this is not to say directors shouldn't experiment or dabble with new stuff but our man Bhandarkar seems to have gone a bit too far with his new rendezvous with rom-com. From hard hitting real subjects to three love sick men, Bhandarkar hasn't been able to make a smooth transition"
4,Secrets through the glass indeed,"Ms Raudonis has a gift for seeing divinity in the mundane, and communicates with passion and power. Her pain, exaltation and bliss resonate in this slim volume."
1,Big time AVOID CD!,"Unless you are into hiphop music this is a big time AVOID CD. Personally I am into the faster beat type music. This is a slow lathargic CD. Add two small frisbies to a collection with this one. I also tried Best of Vol2. Outside of the first three songs like Runaway it too is a throwawy in my book. I had some pretty good luck with ""dance Mix USA 1995"" from song 11 on. Goodluck"
1,Not what I expected,"I thought this would be a soft suede jacket. I was wrong. It is stiff and even looks stiff when you wear it. It has never softened even after wearing it. I won't order a jacket like this on line anymore. The color was nice but like I said, the jacket feels stiff and looks stiff, very cheap looking."
1,"Buyer Beware -- these are Monarch notes, not the actual book!","So, this is the first time that I have ever ordered a book by an author and ended up with the Monarch notes for it. I think it's VERY misleading to display this book in this manner."
3,Great Iron,This iron saved me a mint in dry cleaning bills. I am in the military and need to have a fresh pressed uniform every day. I rated this a 3 because after about a year and a half of use the internal seal gave way and the iron no longer holds water. I dont have time to deal with returns and dealing with company customer service so I am headed out to buy a new one. Probably not the same model. Over all the temps were acurate if a bit hot. And all the features performed as expected.
2,Waste of good materials,"I was happy with my ActiPress iron for a little over a year. Then it started dripping and in a month ended up leaking like an open faucet. I've read in somebody's review that the cost of repair plus shipping is close to a price of a new iron. So I opened it up. The water tank is just a shaped lid sealed on the rim with some kind of black sealant. I think this construction it's bound to start leaking as the sealant shrinks. Once it starts leaking the water is all over the electrical contacts, may be dangerous too.I will never buy another one of those, which is a shame - I loved the polished surface and the amount steam it produced."
4,Good party rock,"people think they're really cool if they hate bands like poison and motley crue but the truth is all the heavy metal bands of the 80's had something better than these new bands, TALENT! they were more than terrible drums that hardly even follow along with the music, more than some lame guitarriff that any three year old could play no problem,and more than just some horrible out of key singer screaming ditzy lyrics. this album is what rock was supposed to be, Fun! imagine that. some great trax on this album.love on the rocks 8 out of 10 points nuthin but a good time 9.5 back to the rockin horse 7.5 good love 8 tearin down the walls 9.5 look but you can't touch 8 fallen angel 9 every rose has it's thorn 10 (great song!) mama don't dance 8 bad to be good 9very good, if you like good old rock get it!"
3,Open Up & say What!!!!,"Poison quickly followed their debut album with 1988's Open Up and Say... Ahh! The album features their most memorable song, the number one power ballad ""Every Rose Has Its Thorn"". It is a thick slice of hair metal cheese, but even though you know you want to hate the song on principle, you can't help yourself from singing along every time you hear it. ""Nothin' But A Good Time"" is a straight Kiss rip-off, but also extremely catchy."
3,"Good, but Natural isn't better in this case...","I am a big fan of Optimum Nutrition products. I have used their Gold and Platinum Whey products for years. When I saw this natural version, I decided to give it a try. Natural is always better, right? In this case, not so.This mix does not have as good of a flavor as the regular gold standard vanilla. More importantly, the product does not mix as well as the original Gold Standard whey. I like the idea of a natural product, but I will be switching back to the original Gold Standard Whey next time around."
3,Its pretty much what I expected.,"Well, its pretty much what I expected... It is very sweet and it has an after taste(not horrible). Good amount for the price.I really do like The Visalus protein powder but its way too expensive."
5,Mmmm Good,ON's 100% Natural Whey Protien has been a staple in my house for a number of years now. I continue to find it very tasty as a sweet treat at night or as a get me going in the morning shake.
3,Taste Bad,I got the chocolate. It takes like crap. Good thing it's cheap. Maybe I put too much water or something but it was not good. I have tasted the Monster Mass and Monster Milk stuff. That tastes really good. I was hoping this would be the same but it isn't.
3,No cookies and cream flavor,Impressed by prompt shipping. I am a first time buyer.Vanilla flavor tastes ok but not great. I wish they had cookies and cream.
4,Best Protein Powder,"This is an excellent prodect. Many of the protein powders try hard to minimize their caloric value, but sacrifice an important aspect of nutrition by incorporating sucralose. I would much rather consume real sugar and have a higher caloric value than consume synthetic products that I do not believe are 100% safe for human consumption. Optimum Nutrition's 100% Whey Gold Natural makes this possible and the taste is reasonable too."
5,"I think I'll stick with this ""natural"" protein.","I have tried a number of protein powders, including the regular ON Gold Standard Whey and the thing I like about this is virtually no after taste compared to the others containing more artificial ingredients, but then i've always been turned off by artificial sweeteners like splenda, equal, etc. It is a little more bland than the others and not that enjoyable with water, but great with fat free milk and an occasional banana, or strawberries thrown in the blender. Speaking of which, it mixes well in a shaker bottle, or blender. I haven't tried just stirring it with a spoon yet. The bottom line is, while it is a little more expensive than some others, the natural aspect of it will keep me coming back for more when this runs out. I have only tried the chocolate, but I am anxious to try the vanilla - which by adding fresh, or frozen fruit can make a variety of flavors."
5,ALL NATURAL !!!,This is one of the only protein powders I could find that DOES NOT have ANY artificial sweetener in the ingredients. It seams ironical to me the I take protein powder because I am trying to build a healthier body and almost all protein supplements contain some form of artificial sweetener !
1,"Be careful, or you may have problems.","Just beware when using any of these whey protein supplements, you can get a bad case of constipation. This is exactly what happened to me. It was severe enough to require a trip to my doctor. If you insist on taking whey protein isolate, take some type of fiber at the same time."
3,Strawberry Whey,"The flavor is a bit weird, but easy to get used to. I'd rather not buy it again though, chocolate or even vanilla flavor is better. Mix with water really makes you burp. But, if you mix it with Costco's soymilk and ice cubes, it tastes GREAT!"
1,whats this,"i don't know, but when i buy this product, i saw on the pictures, it says,that have; 2g of sugars, but when i got'it i notice that have 3g of sugars.so is nat realy what they post on here, they should post the right pictures."
3,I like the high protein content,I bought it for that. I loved it at first but there is an aftertaste I'm not fond of. I will keep searching I think.
4,Better than Most,I have tried many protein powders both super chemicals and natural. This is one of the few which make up to a great shake.
4,Light flavor,"There's a reason they have a more intense chocolate flavor as well. If you don't want to get overwhelmed with sweetness, this is a good choice. Probably great for mixing with other ingredients."
1,PERVERT,"Dis guy was a PERVERT and distroys everytimng good about all Christianity and Holyness. I tink if you believe all dis then you must be a cryptofacist perv like all deez guyz.... Man, don believe what dis guys is layin out....heez corrupting youths and poisoning da well of human consciences....piece out"
3,Incredible High-energy video,"I was actually at this concert about 20 years ago. This shows the incredible stage presentation of perhaps the tightest band I've ever seen. Many costume and set changes make The Tubes history's greatest rock 'n roll revue bands.The Tubes even did some risque things on stage. Unfortunately, this video edits out some of those moments.But, this is a fantastic overview if their show."
3,MONO audio track on VideoMindcrime disc,"The original VHS version was in MONO as well. Why couldn't the company or the band insist on a STEREO track for VideoMindcrime. The DVD portion is the reason to purchase this item, which I did on the day it was released. I'm disappointed that the effort was not put into this release because this is one of my favorite records of all time."
1,MILKING IT,This is corporate greed.If your a fan you already have this. There is nothing special about this release that hasn't been out before. Here is what the FANS WANT:Remastered Operation Mindcrime 1DVD-A Operation Mindcrime 1STEREO MIX DVD for Video Mindcrime.Is this so hard to do? Why rip us off???
5,Buy or die,"Damn, I wanted to be the first to review this. It is a must buy for sure. Best metal album ever? This is really an *album*, not just a collection of songs. It tells a story (the amazon summary of it is pretty bad, btw) without any printed background information, just the songs themselves. As with many Queensryche albums you *must* listen from start to finish, *must* pay attention and you will be amazed as you pick up more and more of the music and the plot each time. It is amazing how much you can discover in this album (and Rage for Order, I might add) with each new listen. Only an insane fool would pass up buying this."
5,My Favorite Album EVER!,"It's really too bad that I'm only allowed to rate this ablum with 5 stars because it just doesn't do justice to the grandure of this album. I don't even think an infinite number of stars would do justice on rating this album. I find it hard to believe that it's been 12 years since the release of this album. I was 13 when I first heard it, and now I'm 25 and I still listen to it as if it were the first time hearing it. Everytime I hear it EVERY SONG grabs me and jerks my emotions. The album just never gets old and to me that quality is what sets a PHENOMENAL group apart from a band that ends up on ""Where Are They Now"". Thank God for bands like Queensryche. This is my favorite album EVER!"
5,a great and funny teen story!,"Overall, i thought this book was great. I loved how it just started with a bang and it really grabbed me in. My friend had raved about it and so i decided to try it and absolutely adored. Mia,the main character, explains how difficult it is to be a princess and be just a normal teenage girl who is trying to understand herself,her family, her friends, and of course BOYS! Once i bought this from the store i immediately got the rest of the series the next day. this story has a little of everything: romance ,humor,and a little bit of a fairy tale with the whole princess thing. i recommend this book to anyone who thinks they need to have a little humor in their lives!*Also, if you like this series you can go to the author's website at:www.megcabot.com"
5,THE BEST BOOK EVER!!!!!!!!!,"You would think all princesses are bratty snobby and/or prim and proper. Not true for 14 year old Mia. Things couldn't be worse for this flat-chested 5 foot 9 girl with size 10 feet. She already has to deal with her mom dating her algebra teacher, a subject she' failing miseribly. This is the best story and I hope that whoever you are reading this will give this book a try. I thought the book would a frilly and stupid but it deals with some hard issues and it'll make you smile so GIVE IT A CHANCE!!!"
2,"""The Princess Diaries"" didn't meet my expectations.","I know everybody else raved about it, but I have to admit I liked the movie much better. The filmwriters (Thankfully) pretty much rewrote the whole thing. I'm not exactly sure why, but I found the movie much more interesting. I'll probably read the second one, just because I want to find out what happens. Sorry Meg Cabot, but that's my opinion."
3,what happened?,"Mia is in love with Josh. He drinks heavily, is a senior, is insanely egotistical, and doen't give a @%$*. Mia is absurdely uncomfortable with her surroundings. She freezes up anytime anyone she ""likes"" is around. I liked the first half of the book, but it went downward from there."
4,good,"Well I read the book then I saw the movie, I have 2 say the movie's better. but still good. It's worth reading."
4,Great Read...Especially for Christmas,"It is a great read especially for Christmas because when my dad bought this book I knew it was totally worth the money. I keep this book as a souveneir for Christmas 2001. When I started reading the first page I already knew it'll lead to something new.This book talks about Mia, who is a ""freak"" because she is five foot nine, a flat-chested freshman and is flunking algebra. She has like a total crush on the most popular guy in the school: Josh Ritcher.So she gets him. But things don't turn out Mia thought they would. First Josh gets drunk and rubbed his leg with Mia's, then he smashed his lips with Mia's just to get on the cover of Teen Zine. Mia finally decides that Josh is so not the guy she thought he was, so they break up.Things turn out normal again. Lily and her are best friends again, and Josh and that bratty Lana is back together. Oh, and did I mention? Mia made a new friend, Tina."
4,Good for Teen Girls,"... Normally, I stay away from frivolous adolescent novels where the main character's only problem is boys, but this one is more than that.Everyone probably knows by now that the focus of this novel is on a New York girl, Mia, who finds out that she's a...Mia's best friend is a character I can relate to. She's even further from the stereotypical teenage girl. The movie, I thought, glamorized Mia's situation.Another plus is that the Princess Diaries is hilarious! I don't often find myself laughing out loud in the middle of a novel.Those of you who are skeptics should try this book anyway because it's very short too."
2,PARENTS PLEASE DON'T LET YOUR CHILDREN READ THIS BOOK!!!!,"I found this book a very interesting book to read. The storyline was very creative, but the content was absolutely innapropriate. Countless times Mia complained about her breast size, there was a lot of sexual references, and there was a part in the book where Mia says that her friend was being stocked by a foot fetishist. There were also a couple of references to transexuality\homosexuality... as well as Mia mentioning that there was a man pretending to be blind so women will help him cross the street, and then (sexually) harass them! I'm sorry to be so blunt... and gross, but I'm just bringing up some of the many disgusting innuendos that your children may run into by reading the Princess Diaries series. Though I do highly recommend the movie version made by disney, with all of the innuendos and such taken out."
4,An Urban Princess? Riiiiiiight...,"Though the plot may be a little farfetched, I have read this diary-style book no less than 13 times already. I can really identify with the main character-though I'm not a princess that lives in New York-because I can relate with the fact that she's unpopular. Other kids at school won't give me so much as the time of day (not that I ask for it!), but when test-time comes, whoo! Suddenly everybody's my friend. But I digress (I love that word! Such a nice one for an eighth-grader :D)...I thouroughly enjoyed this book and the sequel, #II, and am anxiously waiting for #III. I sound like I'm writing a book-report, don't I? Oh, joy..."
2,"""The Princess Diaries"" didn't meet my expectations.","I know everybody else raved about it, but I have to admit I liked the movie much better. The filmwriters (Thankfully) pretty much rewrote the whole thing. I'm not exactly sure why, but I found the movie much more interesting. I'll probably read the second one, just because I want to find out what happens."
5,Princess Diaries,I liked this book because it's a fun story. I also like it because it has shown me how things can happen when you least expect it. I defintely recommend it for kids who like stories that are realistic.
5,"Overall, it was good",You know I just read the sample for this book and found that it really quite interesting. I am so excited to buy this book.
5,:-),"This was one of the best books i had ever read! I'm a 9th grade english student and this book totally caught my eye - because of the cover! So i ended up reading it and loved it! My mom was actually like why are u laughing out loud! READ THIS BOOK u'll like it! Also read angus,thongs,and full frontal snogging!"
4,Not The Best,"Okay this book was good, but not as intriquing as 1&2. Meg could have done better. Its all about Mia wanting to break up with her boyfriend Kenny,(Which she finally does) to get with her best friends big brother. It ends like the movie, Mia gets Micheal, and leaves for Genovia. I give it 4 stars just for being cheasy like the movie."
2,Not for pet owners,"This works well for hard floors and picking up larger things, but it really doesn't pick up pet hair. That was the main reason I bought this. So I'm very disappointed that it can't suck cat hair off my furniture. I'm going back to Dirt Devil."
5,Emergency Blanket,Purchased this as an emergency blanket for the vehicle. Appears to be strong and well made. I would recommend it.
3,Long Time Gone by David Crosby/Carl Gottlieb who cares?,"The interesting part of the book is when Crosby is in prison. How he finds his way in a world that does not care he is a rock star.Crosby tells this part of the story in his own words, and it's a good story. The rest of it is awful. A guy who is supposed to be a musician and songwriter is just a drug addict who knew some other one dimensional characters, mostly musicians, along the way. He pulls out of it in the end, but who cares. Carl Gottlieb has a lot to say, but like I said who cares."
5,Wonderful!,I bought this for my husband a guitarist and he loved it.It turned out to be a great Christmas gift!
1,Poorly Designed,"I bought this popcorn popper after having had a similar type popper several years ago. I was very disappointed when I opened the box and took the popper out. Two pins that hold thelid to the center rail were missing. There was one pin on each side of the lid and I was not sure if that was the way it was designed. After the first use when I took the lid off to clean it, the other pins fell out. I realized then that there were supposed to be four not just two pins. I was able to put them back in, but everytime I clean it the pins fall out. The originial popper I had years ago never had this problem. I called Back to Basics and explained the problem. They are supposed to send me new pins for the lid that are designed differently to correct the problem. I am still waiting for them to arrive. I will admit the popcorn tastes great, but it is not worth the hassle to reassemble the lid after every use."
2,poorly designed and built,"As far as taste, the popcorn was good- but as far as construction goes, the popper is very poor quality. I knew it was probably a bad sign when the first thing i pulled from the box was a list of where to buy replacement parts.I used the popper 3 times. It is very difficult to hold the popper still during popping. The doors on the top don't stay shut during popping, so you can expect to get splattered with hot oil occasionaly.Upon the third use the top came off and the viewing window cracked. The hinges on the top are poor quality.As for burning popcorn/oil, I have never had that happen, but then again i used coconut oil instead of the oil they sold with the product.I hear the stainless steel popper is better."
2,Stove Top Popper,"The taste in wonderful, but the &quot;see through&quot; window cracked and eventually broke. Love the taste, but the construction was poor!"
2,top poorly constructed,Small knob on top came apart after about 6 uses of popcorn popper. Poorly constructed.
1,"""Whirley - Not""","The Back to Basics popper is a pale substitute to the original Whirley - Pop. I took a chance with this item because I believed in Target to only provide high quality products for it's customers. I was really dissappointed in the quality of this item. The gears were sticking, the window clouded up after 3 uses and the lid had actually started seperating from itself in the midlle. When I went to pop the corn, it actually stuck to the pan and began to burn. I am a loyale Target shopper, however, my image is tarnished after that piece of junk found it's way to the Target shelves."
2,You're Not Missing Anything,"It took me a while to get through this book. I kept losing interest and I would just set the book down and pick it up a few days later to continue reading it. So Professor Nikki Chase becomes involved in a 3rd murder mystery. How believable is that? Why not introduce new main characters into the Ivy League Series who solve mysteries? And why does it always have to be murder? Anyway, this ""mystery"" was too easy to solve. Nikki was always either at the right place at the right time or she would ask suspects numerous questions and they would give her the answers she wanted without any suspicion as to why she was concerned. Nikki's relationship with Dante Rosario is getting old and stale and I see no point in their relationship. I predict the 4th book in this series will be titled ""Brown Bomber"" and Nikki will again be involved in a 4th murder investigation at Brown University."
5,This is not a bootleg!. . .,"This record is not for a bootleg dvd. Geez people, this is Amazon! They are not going to knowingly post a bootleg dvd. This is a record to find out what the potential buyers for a dvd release would be. When you click on this record, you get an option to sign up to be notified by email when the dvd comes out. So if enough people click on that option, maybe it will finally be put on dvd."
3,Little Darlings is a great movie for it's time.,"This is one of my favorite movies from my growing up years. I bought this tape a few years ago and it was just as I remembered, except they took out the part where the girls came forward to the camp director and told her the whole story.This was a real important part of the story and contributes to the moral. I wish they had just stuck with the original version.I hope when (or if) they come out with this movie in DVD, they will include the ""confession""Little Darlings"
4,See the video,"If you have seen this in TV then you have not seen this movie...you have to see the uncut version to appreciate it. I remember this movie from my youth and recently watched it again and I still love it as an adult. Kristi, Tatum and Matt all seem so young and raw..."
1,Extremely Disappointed,"I received the stopwatch in a ""Sportline 461"" package that is a lot different than the one presented here. The design looks nicer, however I find it less user-friendly. I have the Sportline 470, so I know that the design presented here (but not the product shipped) is better.As far as the stopwatch goes, I am not impressed. If I go from countdown timer mode to stopwatch mode, it stops and zeros out the timer.One thing that I do like about the timer is that when you go into that mode it lets you select every digit. So, for 30 minutes instead of pressing or holding down to increase minutes one by one up to 30, it instead lets you select the 3 and leave the zero. Very efficient. I might have kept this for that reason alone, but receiving the same model number that is very different (and inferior) to the one presented here confuses me and I am just going to send it back.I have the 470 model and it is excellent. I'm going there right now to give it a good review."
3,Nice Spin on Marriage of Convenience Plot,"This is my first B.Krahn book and it wasn't bad, it wasn't a phenomenal page turner either. The characters' character changed several times throughout the book so that they became almost unbelievable. The father for example, took his daughter with him everywhere when she was a little girl but when she was a young woman he ignored and insulted her. Usually a good father remains a good father and a bad one remains bad. Also it didn't make sense that Brien was bold enough to run off and get herself married to a total stranger yet easily gave in to later marrying a man she detested, she should have run away or done something dramatic and headstrong. The book did use the marriage of convenience storyline in a way that is different than what is typically used in romance novels. My advice borrow don't buy and don't read when you're in the mood for something that is totally engrossing you'll never be that taken in by it."
1,Painfully Shrill,"I'm afraid the book reads life a serialization from the local alternative press; the main character lives in a world of imagined slights, forever aggrieved, forever on the attack. Might have worked if the writing were crisper, less predictable, less demographically driven. If these were actual people, living actual lives, maybe it would be worth the time. As is, it's just polemics tarted up in novel form.On the plus side, it is marginally better than that Devil Prada book!"
2,not hardcover material,"This just isn't that good, and not worth shelling out the money for a hardcover. I liked the premise, and thought I was settling in for a Terry McMillan type of tale, since that is the hype they are going for with this. But, unfortunately, Terry has nothing to worry about! While her books pull you in and carry you along, this one just dragged. I just couldn't care about these characters, and she just goes on and on without getting to the point.Overall, a disappointment."
2,blah,"I did not fall in love with the characters. Rather, I would like to kill every one of them. I bought this book thinking it would be a fun read. I ended up wanting to get my money back.This book is full of pompous, money-grabbing women whose idea of a good life is to find a rich boyfriend/husband. A life-altering, earth-shattering crisis arises when one of them (...) must decide whether or not to choose a ""poor"" man.Between Usnavys who flaunts her riches to stuck-up (...) Rebecca, and Amber/Cuicatl who is reminiscent of the Christian evangelists, this book merely goes through the motions of being ""diverse"" in its portrayal of Latinas."
1,makes a diservice to young girls prone to eating disorders,"I started reading this book knowing it was not going to be an intellectual kind of book but rather a fun, light one. However, by page 23 there were like 3-4 mentions of bulimia and throwing up as an accepted way to be thin. I know someone who just spent 7 weeks at an eating disorder unit at a prestigious hospital. She had anorexia but there were many bulimics there and the damage bulimia causes to the body of a young woman is really frightening. Young girls reading this book might just get the idea that throwing up is ok in order to look thin or to fit into a certain dress at a certain time but in reality bulimia becomes addictive and in the end bulimia just makes the person really, really sick. The salivary glands swell up and they also end up with chipmunk cheeks, which is the opposite of looking thin. I would not recommend this book to anyone. Besides the foregoing, the writing is like from someone in 9th grade, not a college graduate."
3,Not too bad,"Definitely a Latina ""Waiting to Exhale."" What worked for me was how she was able to intertwine the lives of six women and give them each their own distinct voice. It's definitely a challenge for any author.However what didn't work was that I felt a bit of distance from the characters, like the narrative was cold and standoffish (although it worked in the Rebecca chapters, since that's her character), and boy did I telegraph Sara's ""dark secret"" the moment she was introduced in Chapter 1. Also, Lauren struck me as more than a bit whiny.But ending on a postive note, once I got past the first chapter, it was an easy read from there."
1,The Dirty Girls Social Club,"It's a ""girly"" book. I can relate to all the characters in the book, except for the Amber. Amber's character simply throws me off, it's like they needed to have the mexican be someone important and a singer is all the author could come up with. I have an ""Amber"" type of friend and a more realistic career choice is a photographer.Over all the book is an okay/funny vacational book."
4,Suuuucias!!,"After having this book on my wish list for-ev-ah I finally decided to order it after reading Alisa Valdes-Rodriguez's short story in `GIRLS NIGHT IN' and loving it. So I anxiously awaited the delivery of my copy of `DIRTY GIRLS SOCIAL CLUB' and tore into it the day that I got it and am happy to say that I thoroughly enjoyed it and do hope that they do turn this book about six Latina's in Boston who have been friends since college in to a movie as has been reported! Call me a sucker for a happy ending (don't worry there are no spoilers here) but it did not bother me in the least how neatly everything was tied up for these six young women. I do not read chick-lit for any other purpose than to laugh and to have that warm and fuzzy feeling when I am finished and that is exactly what this book gave me. Valdes-Rodriguez is a bright and funny new author with a lot of promise and I look forward to reading more of her books in the future, 4 stars!"
4,pretty good,"The book is not the best, but it was pretty good. There is no deep ,underlying meaning or prize-winning writing, but the book is witty and keeps you engaged in the lives of the characters. This is the perfect book for taking to the beach or lounging on a lazy afternoon."
3,Where o' where has my little pedometer gone?,"Great on accuracy (as long as it is level -- like most pedometers). Only 3 stars, though, because the belt clip is not a full belt clip but a mere spring clip. Mine came off twice. It would have probably come off more than that except for the fact that I have not recovered it yet.For only a few dollars, it is well worth it; HOWEVER, be wary of your delivery charges. I was charged from Amazon's third-party seller almost twice the cost of the pedometer for delivery. (It required no more than a small padded envelope and was sent via regular US mail.)"
4,"Little, Cheap, and Easy!","I often walk to the store or post office and was curious about how far I was walking, so when I saw how inexpensive this pedometer was, I decided that it would be fun to try and that I wouldn't really be out anything if it didn't work, or if I didn't use it.It counts steps very accurately. The first day I used it I counted my steps myself, and would check every one hundred steps...it was right on.It's not as accurate as far as measuring distance, but I know that's my own error in setting the stride length. My pace and stride length vary as I go so I'm still working on finding an average.If you're looking for a simple pedometer for a good price, I recommend this product."
2,Not impressed,"Worked fine for about a month, then wasn't accurate, either for steps or miles. Of course I didn't pay much for it either."
1,a gift that bombed,My sister wanted one for Christmas so I got this. It is really hard to calibrate. Its been a week and I don't think she has got it right yet. I wouldn't buy it again. There are much more expensive ones but I thought something fairly cheap would be good for start with. You do indeed get what you pay for....
5,pedometer,"these are the third and fourth ones I have ordered for family and friends. I love it. It is not fancy, but that's not what I wanted. They got here in record time and work perfectly!"
1,Totally Inaccurate Pedometer,"Although this pedometer is cleanly designed with its buttons easy to use and a clear digital display, it is worthless because it is inaccurate. I left it on for several hours while walking around doing normal tasks, and it registered only a few steps. I had clipped in on my belt just as the instructions described.I think the problem is that this pedometer is just not sensitive enough. If you are walking normally, it doesn't register the steps. If you are pounding the pavement, it does better."
3,ok,It is not all that accurate for counting steps at my work. every bump and jiggle counted as a step
2,75 % still working,"I ordered 45 of these for a contest at work. I needed to order 60 to replace the ones that stopped working after the first 2 weeks. But they are simple enough for everyone to use, they do not reset accidently too often and they were only 2 bucks each, so I;m not complaining. Not to mention we call them ""generous"" They click over steps even if you laugh hard."
3,Pedometer- OK,"The pedometer works ok, but often changes from Miles to KM. It must reset the distance to change, so the traveled amount is lost. It was not very expensive, so I guess you get what you pay for. Amazon could have done a better job with the sale. They are not very flexible with payments............ Pedometer- Ooltewah, TN USA"
1,The price reflects the quality.,"I received this pedometer in the mail two days ago, wore it all day yesterday and while I took it off that night, I was missing the ""Mode"" button. I barely touched it all day and in less than 12 hours, buttons were falling off."
2,Ordered two - one worked,"Ordered two of these pedometers in separate orders. First one arrived - black and works well. Second one was red, and never worked at all. Not worth replacing the battery and hoping that was the issue. Not impressed."
5,"Great learning toy, that is also really fun!","Got this for my two Granddaughters, age 3 and 1 1/2. They both love it! They learn, while having loads of fun! The cards are plastic, so they don't get torn or broken, and the toy is very durable, and fun for them to use."
2,"Yeah, lame CD.","I agree with an earlier reviewer, Matthew Ryan, that the missing Annie Lennox song makes this CD a waste of moolah. The one song Demi danced to and absolutely should have been included, is ""Little Bird"" available on the album, 'Diva.'Diva however, does not have the full version of the song (around 4:38) which sounds much more definitive in the beginning and the end, although the track length is the same as the version on Diva. The full version can be found on CD singles that are now out-of-print."
3,WW1 SPY,"Set during WW1, Julie Andrews plays a ""Mati-Hari"" type heroine who romances Rock Hudson. Not a bad movie with some interesting plot twists. Not an Academy Award winner but enjoyable none the less."
2,They have murdered Darling Lili!,Darling Lili has been one of our favorite movies for a long time. We were lucky enough to get a good VHS recording off of television years ago and watch it several times each year. So we were delighted when it came out on DVD.We saved our first showing for New Years Eve with the whole family. What a mistake! The DVD copy is totally butchered and the funniest parts cut out entirely. Ugh!!!I wouldn't have minded so much if the footage was for some reason no longer available -- but there it was on the DVD as Special Features. It wouldn't have taken someone with the right editor more than an hour or two to put the movie back together again. Why didn't they????
2,Jungle as easy listening,"I haven't been bored by a drum and bass album this much since Goldie's insipid ""Timeless."" Most of this album tries really hard to leave jungle for easy-listening-lite-jazz-john-tesh-style stuff altogether. It's pretty much succesful on that note, but I sure as hell want to listen to something besides cool ""jazz"", or i'd probably be reviewing a yanni album. And the four or so hard jungle tracks are pretty uneventful and boring for that type of music. I say pass this up unless you've got a lot of moeny to burn."
5,Nice Watch,Have had a lot of complements on this watch. I bought this one and one gray. The black one looks more casual and the gray one looks more... professional... i guess. They both look really good.
4,Skagen Watch Review,I have owned Skagen watches and am pleased with my new purchase. I like the style of the watch and the reputation of Skagen as a company.
2,Clasp hard to work and broken,"Really nice watch as pictured. Clasp came broken. Watch is big. Strap is very long. I am 5'9 male, slim athletic build, the excess strap goes three quarters of the way to the face. I returned it and kept the 233XLTTM, similar watch but in titanium: that clasp worked. I would have kept the black one too, if the clasp had worked. I know I could have exchanged it, but wasn't worth the hassle to me. I like them because they are so lightweight. I'd be interested to see how it holds up in a few years."
5,Awesome Watch,"I've been wearing this watch as my every day timepiece for a few months now and I have to say that I am very glad I bought this watch.For those that state they have trouble with the clasp, they simply aren't putting the watch on correctly. The clasp clicks down and then has a swing arm fastener, so there is no way this thing will ""accidentally"" unbuckle.The watch is extremely light weight and comfortable to wear. The color of the watch does not fade over time and it is relatively scratch resistant. The timepiece itself is accurate and doesn't need to be adjusted at all, and the date window is a very handy feature.Highly recommend this watch for everyday users. Not too much of a ""showy"" timepiece but great otherwise."
4,Nice watch for reasonable price!,This Skagen watch is nice looking slim and light. Titanium band is comfortable and pleasant to wear.From my point of view the date display is too small and one needs to have a really good vision to read it.I would not recommend wearing this watch during any kind of sport activities.
2,"Good watch, bad clasp.","I'd like to give this watch 4 stars, but I can't. The clasp on the watch is unreliable. Sometimes it will stay fastened, other times the clasp will come undone. I can never tell if it's fastened well or if it's going to fall off of my wrist."
2,"Small wrist, don't buy!","I love the design of this watch, and will probably replace it with another Skagen watch, but I'll be steering away from steel mesh wristbands from now on. The band is very long and inflexible, and the excess wraps up on the underside of the watch. Since it doesn't bend well, if you have a lot of excess it will cause the band to bow out and not lay flat on the wrist. Thought about cutting some of the band out, but I'll probably take the conservative route and just return it for a watch with a different band material."
4,clasp opens,"This is a very nice looking watch, and my college-aged son really likes it. However, the clasp does come open periodically."
3,"Great watch, lousy clasp","I've owned three of these (exact) watches, and I love them. I've broken two crystals by my own carelessness, and it was cheaper to replace the watch than the crystal. HOWEVER, the quality of the clasps has gone downhill. On the last watch I bought, the clasp would not ""click"" closed. I ended up re-using the clasp from my previous model. The clasp is painted black, and the paint scratches off easily. So now I have a spanking new watch with a scratched-up half-black clasp. Surely Skagen can do better!"
2,Wrong Watch,"Masterpiece Jewels, Inc (It'sAboutTime) sent a watch in the packaging for the 233XLTMB, but the watch they sent was in fact a 233XLTBBC, a cheaper watch than was paid for. http://www.amazon.com/gp/aag/details/ref=aag_m_ss?ie=UTF8&isAmazonFulfilled=1&marketplaceID=ATVPDKIKX0DER&isCBA=&seller=A3W4OSIDRTNLCE#aag_legalInfo"
2,I got blisters!,"This is not the shoe you want for wearing around DisneyWorld. I got them before our trip, and started to wear them to work (to break them in).There is a seam just above the last knuckle of my toes. I would get a rub when I would put my foot down. The rub tuned into a blister. I tried different degrees of tightening. Nothing helped. The sandals look good, but I think I wasted my money."
3,A peculiar book,A peculiar mixture of excellent descriptive writing and very poor theology. It stays in the memory but one wonders what the point is (ignore the bizarre speculations of the previous reviewer who has got it all wrong. LBJ didn't start the war in Vietnam by the way). It shows Blish's odd combination of literary strengths and philosophical weaknesses.
3,Battery/Charging System Inferior,"I give this three stars only because it is a Norelco, but not more because the battery failed after eight months because I left it plugged in too often in part because of the fact that the charging system does not tell you when its charged. I'm going to upgrade to the Norelco cord/cordless, but would not buy this product again because of those inconveniences. Caveat Emptor."
4,Norelco works best for me,"Norelco shavers work better for me than anything else. Razors give me ingrown hairs/shaving rash. So do other brands of electric razors. When my old Norelco died after 8 years of daily use and much travel, I knew I had to buy another. This is a basic model--fine for most of us--that shaves close and comfortably. The only downside is the NiCd battery--you need to charge them properly to maximize the capacity and life. That was the problem with my old one--too many hotel maids and small children unplugged it after a partial charge, etc., so that finally it didn't hold enough charge to shave with. When you first start shaving with an electric shaver, your face will need several weeks to adjust, but if you get shaving rash from your razor or current shaver, try a Norelco, they work for me."
3,Good,The product is good. First time I am using automatic shaver and I did not face any problem. It shaves very smoothly. The performance of battery is also good.
4,"This is not your old Norelco, but it works just fine","I'm still in the process of replacing the batteries in my old Norelco (and I mean 20 years old), so I thought I'd purchase a spare to get me through. This unit had reasonable reviews and a reasonable price so i took the plunge.Here's the deal, if you're looking for the heft and weight of your old Norelco, it ain't here. To cut costs, they made it lighter, less bulky and not nearly as ""substantial"". But that's not the main point. It shaves fine! It holds a charge for a reasonable period of time (mines going on two weeks and no reduction in blade speed is obvious) and, let me repeat, it shaves every bit as good as I expected.So, if you want to spend less coin and get a good shave, this is a great choice."
4,Recommended,"A great smooth shave even when I've not shaved for a few days. This model is exceptionally quiet which means you can still hear music/ tv whilst shaving - although the sound is a bit similar to high pitched dental drill whinnings!! The beard trimmer works fine. It recharges well. All in all, I've been using it for a few weeks now and would not hesitate to buy it again."
4,"It can be good, only if you know how to use it...","I've used this Norelco for 11 months. I will make it clear right now that in those 11 months I have had no problems with it whatsoever, it had been a pleasant shave each time.If you are new to shaving with automatic shavers such as this one (like I was), the trick of shaving will come to you after a dozen shaves. Just do it slowly, pull your skin, don't press too hard (only hard enough, you'll find your limit).I recommend using a before-shave for best results - it really brings out the best from the shaving system. I use Lectric Shave."
2,Big disappointment from longtime Norelco owner,"Things just seem to be going downhill for my expereinces with Norelco. I bought my 6618X razor last October and have been quite let down. First, the box said it was made in Holland like all my previous shavers; inside on the unit it's marked made in China. Next, don't even think this thing can operate on the cord when the battery gets flat -- you'll simply have to wait until it gets recharged. Whose idea was that? My advice is to look VERY carefully to see if it can be operated with the cord as well as cordless; this was never a concern in my past Norelco's, either they had a battery or they didn't but they always worked on the cord. I imagine when the battery gets worn out this shaver will end up in the trash. Pity."
4,"Looks nice, keeps time well","This watch looks classic, is very light weight, and almost feels like you are not wearing it. Sometimes that is a problem however, Once I was in bed and scraped the finish from the front of the watch and now it is blemished slightly. It may be made of titanium, but there is a brushed metal finish that can be scraped, and I may have thought twice about buying it if I had know that. If you are a careful person you may not have the problem that I did. Anyway, it keeps time great, and I always feel stylin' when I wear this watch!"
4,Nice elegant watch,This is a nice elegant watch. It's light weight and the large watch face make it easy to read the time. I like the 24 hour markings on it. The date indicator could be bigger compared to the size of the watch face. This a nice watch and a good value for the money.
2,Might be great...if it would stay on!,"Loved the look and feel of the watch, but it practically fell off my arm a half dozen times the first day I wore it. I'm a thin guy and liked the idea of watch that didn't look too big or heavy on my skinny arm. While it met that criteria, the band clasp continually came undone. Tried several different tricks in attempt to solve the problem, but ultimately had to return the watch. Disappointing!"
1,Broken band,"I bought this watch from amazon three weeks ago, and delivered as I expected. Today, the band fell off from the watch. It seems the titanium band was glued to the watch. Anybody has any suggestion to resolve this issue? I want to call Amazon or Skagen to get refund or repalcement, any number to call?"
1,"JUNK! Beware of this ""back alley"" type purchase.","At my age I should know that if something looks too good to be true...it probably is. In that respect this watch did not dissapoint. The fine styling and sleek look of the piece made me think that the price was a bargain. Yet I feel like I bought this off of some guy at a carnival.The watch did look great, light and sleek and simple to operate. I set the time, I set the day, and ""clicked"" it and the second hand began moving. I put it on me and love the thin light feel to it. I got five minutes from my home (on my way to work...on my birthday) only to discover that the watch ceased working!Dead as a doornail. I do not know if it is merely the battery, but a watch that breaks down within 5 min. of ownership is NOT a good sign, and for me that makes this junk. I am happily returning it for a refund."
5,Great value,"I own several Skagen watches. These are a great value for your dollar. I particularly like the mesh band. Easy to adjust and doesn't pinch. These watches are designed to appear ultra thin and they do just that. Very classy, stylish look and they keep excellent time. If you are tired of wearing a 2lb computer on your wrist...get one of these, you won't be sorry."
4,Great watch. Band adjustments tricky,"I suggest going to the internet to get the best explanation of adjusting the tricky, but cool mesh watch band..."
4,Skagen blue,I purchased the Skagen model 233XLTTN with the blue face. The watch is great. It is very accurate and worth the money. My only comlaint is that the fastener on the band is somewhat difficult to work. Overall I am very happy with it.
5,Best I Owned so Far,"I had this watch for about a year now. I just have to say that this is my most favorite watch that I ever owned. Not only is it very light on the wrist, but is also very fashionable. I also love the fact it is made of Titanium for the casing as this is hypoallergenic and doesn't leave that mildew on your arm from water. Absolutely love this watch and especially for only half the price when I purchased it."
1,Not the color shown in the photo,"Picture color is wrong -- definitely not the light silver color in the photos. Appears to be a nice watch, but the one I received is very dark gray. The model number on the package and the back of the watch match the listing, but it's not the watch pictured."
5,Love this watch!,It looks so good I don't want to wear it for fear of scratching it. Super lite and the blue face is not done justice in the picture. If I had to gripe about something it would be the face size and band. The face is slighty larger than I expected and the knob you set the time with digs into my hand at times. The mesh band does not dry for some time after washing your hands. It tends to retaine water in the super fine mesh.
5,Clear Basics,"As well done as any instructional video can be done. More basic instruction, but it has never hurt anyone to re-study the basics in any field or occupation. Footwork, movement and balance are needed as much as good hands to be a complete striker. This video is not a complete resource for boxing, but they want you to buy other videos in the series, so I understand. All in all, if you practice faithfully you will get better. Anderson Silva is a good guy to learn from."
2,Beginners only,"I love boxing. I am a student of the game. I have close to 9 years of training. By this I mean I am a student of the game and I have not taken long extented breaks off from my striking. I also love Anderson Silva. His eye for openings, timing, reaction time in mma is complete. So this is more of an over view, so this not for me. Excellent for beginners.How this video could be better is his advanced boxing foot work, distance, and defense. He showes you in his sparring session, but does not go over in this DVD. Like when he slips a punch and ends up on his sparring partners right side.With all that said I did enjoy the Takedowns DVD. The Dvd is very informative and clear. If you looking for some good info, purchase that.Those who want a great advanced DVD in boxing Title Boxing called ""Freddie Roach's Advanced Punching Techniques"" or ""John Brown's Advanced Shadowboxing DVD"" plus ""John Brown's Effective Footwork DVD."" Those videos are worth their wait in gold."
3,Good instructional for boxing.,"I had previously bought the book about Striking by Anderson Silva and thought this would complement it nicely. The DVD is just a rehash of the footwork and basic punches from the book, with some new parries, blocks, and slips. I found all the new info very helpful but was left wanting more out of the strikes, no combos were shown, just your basic jab, cross, hooks, overhand, uppercut. It is nice to see all of those in motion though as compared to the book. The DVD does a good job of breaking down the motions and shows every strike from 4 points of view so you have a good idea of the motion. A good addition to any person wanting to improve standup."
4,Chris's Review,"The Ghost of Thomas Kempe is a very good story of which the Harrison family move from their old house to a new Countryside Cottage but they dont knpw that a 300 year old bloke is trying to haunt them. The family recieved letters and messages as if the GHOST was trying to haunt them.The atmospheric detail and Archaic language used,was to a good effect. The book was quite good but the ending was not very well thought out!"
3,BIG Disappointment,"While the size and scope of this book is impressive, the quality of the prints is poor, at least in comparison with the wonderful prints found in the book ""Botanical Prints From the Hortus Eystettensis"" I purchased the Besler Florilegium expecting to find prints of the same caliber but they lack the detail and antique look of the prints found in the Hortus Eystettensis.If I had a do-over button, I wouldn't purchase this book."
1,Buy a Schumacher,"These vector ""smart"" units are useless. I've had one for 3 yrs now and not ONCE has it charged a battery. I took the initial unit back since all it did was give me ""fault errors"". Got the new unit, went to use it a month later, same fault error ""F03 Open Cell"" telling me the battery needed replaced. I have tried to use this garbage unit on at least TEN separate occasions the past couple of years....F03 fault errors every time! Funny thing is, my buddies old ""not smart"" Schumacher charged the batteries right up. Reading some reviews, i noticed someone figured out these units wont charge a battery if it is under 4 volts. WTH? A battery charger that wont charge dead batteries??? Save yourself the headache, avoid this company at all costs.."
1,Will not work in cold temps.,"On 1/16/09 the temp here in Indiana dropped to 8 below zero. My diesel truck did not start and the 2 batteries were run down trying to get the engine to start. I brought my VEC1093 out from the garage (it was about 45 degrees in the garage) and attemped to charge the batteries. It has always functioned fine in warmer weather, but alas when I needed it the most it malfunctioned. It kept reporting that the battery was fully charged after 5 min. I wish it was. The 100 Amp booster did not work either. I had to get my 17 year old 20 amp Schauer and it charged the batteries enough to start the engine after 1 hour. The Vector functioned fine after it was warmed. What good is a battery charger that doesn't work when cold??"
1,Not as advertised,"I bought this charger based solely on the advertisement...Big mistake....Had it a very short time and both the clamps broke. I called the manufacture and they said to send it back and they would replace the clamps. Shipping cost would be my responsibility of course. They told me they will replace the clamps with the same cheap ones the broke when I had it. As far as I am concerned, customer service on this charger stinks. I would not recommend anyone buy this charger if dependability is a requirement."
2,After a year of service,"Upon receiving this charger I though it would prove to be quality product. Unfortunately not the case.I have had this charger for a year. All of the labeling has come off the unit. The lableling is barley better than a soup can. The worst thing is that both of the clamps broke at different times.Called Vector and they said to send the unit back to them. I asked if i could just send the broken clamp back for a new one, the girl on the phone said no. If I changed them myself it would void the warrenty. Bogus !Pay $15.00 to send the unit back for a broken clamp.Very poor customer care policies on such an expensive charger.The charger is still charging but would not spend the additional $$$ it costs for this unit. There are many other 3 stage chargers that would perform equally or better.I have yet to get the 100 amp quick start to work.Hope this is helpful"
4,Mostly great cookies,"A wealth of easy to follow recipes that don't need a lot of exotic ingredients. A few recipes were far more bland and boring than the author's over excited descriptions, but most produced great results with minimal effort. One more complicated recipe well worth the additional effort is the chocolate souffle brownies. When she says rich, she means rich."
1,Had it for a week and it broke,I had it for a week and the time set knob broke off. Before that I discovered the alarm function was very weak. A real waste of money.
3,Wonderful Book/Spell Check Failed,"I love the story. Four stars for the story, two stars for the editing. Others commented on the book, so read their reviews. Some have commented on the editing, and I am joining their numbers. The Kindle version I read had numerous and frequent errors - the kind that go past Spell Check but drive you nuts. Everything is spelled correctly, but you see the word ""hear"" instead of ""here"" etc., over and over and over, throughout. And the formatting is a bit dodgy, with carriage returns apparently everywhere, making the lines end abruptly, and then continue on the next line. Chapters run into each other. Very irritating. It needs to go through a car wash, and then be republished. But, if you can ignore all that it's a really lovely book."
3,enchanted april,"didn't love the book as much as i loved the movie, not sure if i would recomend it, but watch the movie, it's charming"
2,Typos galore!,"Even the ""Look Inside"" feature has typos, what a turnoff! I shall go to the library instead. I saw this edition in the bookshop at the New York Botanical Garden and kept it inmind to buy on Amazon. Checking the reviews, I noticed one with caution about typos and checked ""Look Inside"". Not two pages into the story were silly little mistakes which kept one from the delightfully pleasurable read that Enchanted April promises. Sorry. No sale."
1,JUNK!!,"I've used Norelco shavers all my life, always been satisfied until this one. This is a piece of junk. Takes too long to shave with it and it does a lousy job, not to mention all the pulling of hairs. Seems drastically underpowered."
3,ho hum,"IF I wanted a really clean smooth shave I would use a razor...but this shaver is ok...but just ok for everyday use.I shave twice a day, morning and evening...and its really necceary for me with this shaver. It just doesnt get down as close as my older shaver which was also a norelco...but overall I am satisfied with it."
3,DENVER,"Cannot beleive how fast I received this with the free shipping.Very Happy with the product. Had a Norelco razor for 25 years, it was the best. This new one is light weight and quiet but don't beleive it will last 10 years let alone 25, but it does and excellent job of shaving.Price was low...I'm Happy with this purchase."
4,Great! Downside? Cord =/,"It did the job for me, maybe couldn't shave one or two hairs but thats about it, everything feels smooth and nice, and my skin isn't as irritated as I thought it would be, only downside is the cord is so SHORT. So there's NO moving at all."
4,Good razor for the price,"This corded razor shaves reasonably well, but takes longer and more effort than my old Quadra. However, I abanoned the Quadra because the battery was wearing out and the blades cost almost as much as this whole razor.I like the corded feature because there is no battery to wear out over time. Of course, the razor is lighter than the Quadra because there is no battery, and it tends to make a bit of a shrill sound from time to time.Overall, though I like it and would likely buy another when this one wears out."
3,Reflex Plus,"Norelco/Philips would rather I buy a complete new shaver rather than offer replacement blades at an affordable price, say $5-$7 (versus $19-$24)which clearly defies logic or marketing sense..."
1,Norelco is a toy,I purchased the Norelco base on the average of the reviews. They must have been written by people from Norelco. This shaver (I shouldn't use the word shaver) is like a wind up toy. My stubble almost stopped the rotary blades. What a piece of garbage. I STONGLY do not recomend this product. Do yourself a favor and get a Remington foil shaver.
1,norelco shaver,A hunk of junk. Lasted less than a week.I never had a shaver last less than two years.Last norelco I would buy.
2,"Ow, ow, ow! What the heck?!","My wife bought this for me as a second shaver for when I'm not at home. Man, I'm glad for that, because otherwise she'd see me wincing in pain all the time. It must be because I have really, really coarse facial hair, but this thing is painful! I keep looking at it to see if it's accidentally set to 220V because the blades seem to kind of poke around in lazy circles, and periodically grab a hair and come to a complete stop, right before yanking it out of my face. And what's worse is that if I put off using it for a while, my facial hair just gets longer and more coarse, and it hurts even more.A hint if you end up in the same situation as me (coarse hair) ... start shaving from the top down on your face, drawing the shaver down s-l-o-w-l-y and with zero pressure on the skin, over the same area several times. Then once it has pretty much done its thing, you can start working from the bottom up to get the strays."
4,Norelco Corded Razor,"I could have bought a new foil/cutter head for my Braun for $25 or this rajor for $30. It is a good buy for the money. It is light, quiet, and does a nice job. The cord is a bit short but an extension cord fixed that. I don't understand the rush to make everything cordless. I like a corded shaver. No batteries to wear out, no charging circuits to fail and always full power."
3,A NEW ORLEANS CLASSIC,"If you are a lover of early 60's New Orleans R&B, this is a classic. Benny was a back-up singer with Ernie K-Doe and Allan Tousaint. He had a score with ""Lipstick Traces"" (included) and this compilation covers almost all of his Minit and Imperial sides. It was a smart move by Collectables in putting this on CD. If you want to add to your early R&B collection, this is one to consider."
2,Why so expensive?,"Strange that this edition should be so expensive- you can get her entire collected works (which includes the entirety of the harp weaver) for less.That being said, it's incredible."
3,Dale Whitmire,Chris is number 1. If you ever get a chance to see him live GO. I have all of his tapes and CDs he has ever put out and he is just simply the BEST.
4,Trance kings,This album is a masterfully compilated collection of Progressive trance songs allowing any of those who listen to it to either fall asleep comfortably in a fascinating dream world or dance until 3 in the afternoon the next day without ever wanting to stop!!! The breaks and beats take you to another world....to ibiza! It's just magical!
4,Great for a quiet evening,"Is it lounge music? Muzak? Elevator music? All I know is that our parents used to listen to this music on quiet evenings decades ago and it should never have gone out of style. This is very relaxing music. It is perfect for cocktails, loving evenings, massage, napping, summer vacations at a cottage, winter evenings around the fireplace, quiet dinners for two, etc. I have found it is also great for reading. If you need to shut off the world, do what our parents did: put on this album, make a pitcher of martinis, invite your favorite gal or guy over and r-e-l-a-x."
1,"Nice Idea, Poor Execution",I tried to charge this light on two occasions (12 hrs & 16hrs). DEAD ! Never did work. I just boxed it up to return!
1,never worked right,I purchaced 3 of these lights without reading the reviews and wished that i did. I recieved the lights and plugged them in to charge for the 12 hours (red charge light comes on) as suggested by the instructions. I plugged the power cord into the battery and flicked the switch and nothing. I tried to reset the 12v plug into the battery and still nothing. This was with all 3 lights. I plugged them into the car 12v outlets and the lights worked but that was not the purpose i had intended. I tried to charge them using the 12v charging cord and the red charge light didnt come on. I feel that there is a problem with the 12v connection on the batteries. Anyway im in the process of returning them. Not worth the money at any cost.
1,A Bust,Followed directions -- charge for 15 hours and then wait 5 minutes. Turned the light on -- and nothing.
1,not good...dog got diarrhea,not long lasting really and makes the dog sick when she eats too much of the treat. I have to take it away from her after a few minutes so she doesn't eat too much. If she eats the whole thing she gets the hershey squirts (liquid stool frequently). I think a better long lasting treat is peanut butter inside a bone or kong FROZEN. That keeps her busy and she doesn't get sick.
5,All four dogs love these,"I'd have suspected that the vanilla mint wouldn't be the favorite between our four dogs, but it is! These treats fit into a variety of the everlasting treat balls. We have the large blue one that takes two 'dog hockey pucks' and two orange ones that take one each. These are about the density of bone, and are made of not particularly nutritious stuff but are excellent for cleaning teeth and giving the jaws a workout.We have a very old, very big malamute, another pretty old pointer, a big...err...we're not sure what he is exactly, part rotty, part small bear, part cat...and a black lab puppy. Everyone loves the everlasting treats, but this is definitely the favorite followed by the barbecue/smoke one. The malamute isn't much for chew toys, but he absolutely mauls this like he was 12 years younger. Everyones teeth look considerably better after a few weeks of these treats."
2,Not Long Lasting,"Dogs loved it, but they freed it and ate it in minutes. Turns out to be a dollar a minute for the dogs' enjoyment. Might as well have been a milk bone."
3,"Blue Boy, Green Penis",That's all I remember from this book is something about a blue boy with a green penis or vice versa.That and Burroughs notion that we should all go to parties with prerecorded conversations and simply allow our tape players to talk to each other because it isn't as if we are having conversations. I remember this because it ruined the next three or four parties I went to because I kept thinking that everyone might as well have brought their taperecorders because they are all talking about what was already being talked about. These theories come at the end of the book. Up until then there is a lot of words which sound good together but the Cut & Paste experiment really did not do Burroughs good
5,CLASSY TEJANO-COUNTRY MUSIC,PERHAPS ONE OF MY FAVORITE COUNTRY MUSIC CD'S EVER. EMILIO'S VOICE COMES THROUGH LIKE NONE OTHER.
2,n ot super confort but ..,"is ok not super confort but... not too badaftere few days of use, more confort .."
1,So Disappointed :(,"I really wanted to like this book, but I can't make it past page 75 no matter how many times I try. The reviews from national magazines and amazing authors (like Jerry Stahl) said that it was lol funny but I haven't laughed once - or even smirked. In fact, I found it tried much too hard to have humor and completely fell flat. After reading Augusten Burroughs, I likely have a new standard for humor. His books are poignant, intelligent and hilarious while Loser Goes First is typical, trite and self-indulgent. The book received one star because there was no lower option."
2,Small and faded,"These came out of the box nice, but faded after only a few weeks. The shades are pretty small. The string is rather short."
3,Ok...,"I bought these lights because I wanted soft red lights in my living room. I'm not big on bright lights. These are great decorations, but keeping the paper lantern balls on the string of lights is a pain some times. Other than that, they look good and do the job I wanted them to do."
4,Great movie!,"This was a great movie with a great cast.I think Kevin Max was amazing in this story.He also hit it right on the head with the struggles that christians have to face,no dancing around the subject."
3,Nice movie with great music,"What do you get when you get musicians as actors of a movie? Great music and average acting!The movie talks about the lead singer of a popular Christian band who lives a double life. His wife decides to leave him, and his life crashes out without and money to live on. He goes through a phase of being humbled, and the movie has an open ending, which I like, and without them concluding what happened or try to make things all dandy and nice.This is better than a lot of Christian movies I've watched, and I would recommend this based on the message it communicates."
3,Not a bad movie...,"The DVD came within a few days in new condition and I would order again from the same. As far as the movie, it has a good idea for a movie but the script falls short. There was some good ""spots"" but lackluster as a whole. Amazing, I really don't have anything bad to say about the acting. Everyone really fitted the parts well. I feel that the movie left the Lord Jesus completely out, which is exactly what contemporary christian music does best."
1,What was he thinking?,"As one other reviewer has stated, this book is certainly no Lonesome Dove........Although I very rarely give up on a book halfway through, I didn't even make it halfway through this one. The characters in this book seem cartoonish, and their circumstances are impossible to sympathize with. If you must read it, hoping for another Lonesome Dove, get it at the library. Don't waste your money by buying it."
1,Not his best work. Not by a long shot!,"Larry McMurtry's Sin Killer must have been published only on the Author's past reputation. This book features an unbelievable ride through the Great Plains. The first installment of a proposed tetralogy, The Berrybender Narratives, Sin Killer follows the adventures of the Berrybenders, supposedly a large, noble English family traveling the Missouri River in 1832. The characters are unbelievable, and unlikeable. The family is suposedly travelling via a luxury steamer, accompanied by an equally unbelievable and unlikely assemblage of servants, guides, and natives. All of the situations of adversity seem contrived and random. A waste of time."
1,Larry McMurtry Dead Or Missing,"This silly book could not possibly have been written by the genius of Lonesome Dove, so Larry McMurtry must be dead or missing in the wilderness, perhaps stuffed inside some frozen dead buffalo on the prairie in a blizzard , trapped by the frozen hide. Or hiding, maybe. I read the first book, hoping it would Start at some point and Go somewhere, but it never did. This is the silliest, dumbest, most surreal book purporting to be about something actual, that I've ever read and contains some of the most annoying, egregious, and insulting characters ever created. This book must be a spoof on spoofs of the J. F. Cooper genre, is all I can conclude. I will not bother reading the rest of this ""series,"" it is irredeemable! Mr. Larry McMurtry must be found---No Author Left Behind!"
4,good read,While it is an interesting and intricate story I felt that the separate narratives were not stand along stories and should have only had to pay for one book.
2,"Will the real author of ""Sin Killer"" please stand up!","If you're into Barbara Cartland romance novels then ""Sin Killer"" is the book for you. I've read all of the McMurtry westerns and I was confused by this one. The plot revolved around a romance between the Sin Killer and Tasmin a spoiled English wench from the buffoonish Berrybender family. The book jacket should have been illustrated with a cowboy hat wearing Fabio embracing some bonnet wearing, buxom bimbo. The characters are one dimensional and downright absurd. Whoever wrote the book jacket NEVER read this book. It stated that Lord Berrybender came to America to broaden the horizons of his children. NO, he came simply to hunt. He didn't care one wit for his children. Maybe the book jacket author wrote ""Sin Killer"". Will the real author of ""Sin Killer"" please stand up."
2,Useful only to locate certain buildings,"This slender atlas basically is a street grid of Manhattan with street names, address blocks, and the names of institutions listed on it. Information is difficult to locate because--thanks to the slender nature of this atlas--the maps are crowded together, and a capitalized serif font is used. To make things a little easier, an alphabetical index of institutions are listed in the back.The Tauranac is not a visitor/tourist map, more of a slender street atlas for those who need to navigate through Manhattan, and or to locate specific institutions in Manhattan that are usually not listed on other maps. If you require a street atlas, get the Hagstrom Five Borough Atlas. Get Tauranac only if you need to locate buildings by name. The atlas also includes a subway and bus map, but the way it is drawn makes it highly unreadable."
1,Don't buy it--You are getting ripped off!!!!,"This is an attemp by Gull records to cash in on the Judas Priest name. This album and Hero, Hero are unauthorized, substandard reissues of the first two Judas Priest albums Rocka Rolla and Sad Wings Of Destiny. The sound Quality sucks and there is no new material on these that you won't get on the actual albums, which are still available through Cdnow/Amazon.Support Judas Priest, the best heavy metal band of all time, and don't waste your money on this crap. Buy the real thingRocka Rolla and Sad Wings Of Destiny."
4,Great Resource for Understanding Post-Modern Pop Culture and Christianity,"""A Matrix of Meanings,"" although somewhat outdated, did a fair job at breaking down the common aspects of pop culture and analyzing them a post-modern secular and Christian world view.The book, although skips over some areas that I personally would have liked to discuss, clearly describes what ""post-modern"" means and how this current mindset is reflected in movies, art, music, fashion, etc.Overall, it challenges the Evangelical Christian to rethink methods and opinions about ""the world"" and how to go forward with Christ without devaluing culture and things that may not be ""Christian."" It also does a great job at promoting the mindset that everyone in culture is seeking answers and doing so through many media and pop culture outlets, and not necessarily through the institution of church as before.If you would like to know more about post-modern thinking and recent trends in pop culture media, read this book!"
5,Beautiful,"Enchanting, beautiful, haunting. I love to listen to this when I am alone. The remix of Exile is particularly well done, and Whispering Trees is the song that made me fall in love with S&E. I cannot think of a group that is even remotely similar to their sound; they are unique."
1,This shaver stinks.,"I think I would have better luck getting a decent shave with a pencil sharpener than this piece of junk. The old Norelco's were good, this one is a name only made by Phillips. It whines and whimpers like an old lady pedaling a tricycle uphill. Trust me, don't bother with it!"
3,AVERAGE,"After reading the reviews I thought sure this was like the old Norelco shavers. It was not. The shave was average at best, not as comfortable as the old 850RX, and took longer. It was quiet, not as quiet as their more expensive 8140 model, but ok.Guess more was expected due to the mostly positive reviews.It seems shavers are more a personal preference than one being better than another. Oh well."
3,Not so good shave!!,"I bought this electric shaver in order avoid cuts and nicks while shaving. Now I don't get any cuts but it really does not give a close shave that a Gillette razor can. Accordning to the manual the razor will cause some itching for about 3 weeks of initial use, but I still have a little itching even after 6-7 weeks of usagePros : very handy, easy to use and can be used anywhere, no foam needed and no cutsCons : Does not give a close shave.Overall the razor is good for people who really need to avoid cuts and for people on the move."
2,My Norelco,"I was not happy with this razer,I have had many Norelco razers and my common complaint is not being able to change the batteries.I don't think rechargeables are worth the high price since they only last a couple of years and buying replacement heads are almost as expensive as buying another razor."
3,Just average,"I'm not real crazy about this shaver. I have owned it for about a year and I would not purchase another one. The battery does not hold a very long charge anymore and the shave is really not very close. I would classify the shaver as just ""OK"". I would recommend doing some more research before settling for this one."
1,Junk,"It is not worth $1.00. You will get a better shave with a spoon. It has no RPM. The speed is slow even when fully charged for over 8 hours. The blades do not cut even a little stubble. The light has no meaning, as it tells you nothing about the battery supply or if it needs to be charged or running low. The cord is too short.Good - the battery last along time, but how can you tell."
2,My old 835RX is Much Better,"I've been using an 835RX for years. I inherited a new 6843XL and after much comparing I found the old reliable 835 is MUCH better than the 6843.Using the same set of new blades on each razor, I find the 835 quick and efficient while the 6843 is slow and inefficient. It is way better than no razor at all (hence I gave it two stars).Mechanically the only difference I see is that the 835 head is flat, i.e., the three blade heads are in the same plane. They are also less flexible. The three heads on the 6843 face away from each other (slightly) and are very loose, able to float much more than in the 835. I think this floating ability actually hurts the functionality. The blades get lost."
5,As usual it's Great,"I'M A BIG FAN OF THIS CD AND I ALWAYS BUY WHEN A NEW ONE COMES OUT.IF YOU ARE A REAL TRANCE FAN,I RECOMMEND, YOU TO BUY IT.IT IS A FANTASTIC CD AND THERE ARE MANY SONGS THAT YOU WILL ENJOY WHEN YOU LISTEN."
5,LOVES IT!,I saw this exact same cage at a pet store and it cost $55. When I bought the cage on Amazon for only $30 it was an amazing discount. The product came in perfect condition and I couldn't ask for a better cage. I am very satisfied with the product!
3,Not too good not too great,"The positives:It is a nice sized cage for a hamster or maybe even a small rabbit. Easy to clean. You get the best price buying this item off of amazon (I already did my research)The negatives:There is no opening at the top of the cage like most cages have. The part that does open is odd and sometimes hard to lock and open. It said that it was easy to assemble which was some-what true, but it was also said that no tools are required but without the use of tools the sides of the cage won't lock in place as well as they should.Overall:This product was ok not as good as I would have wanted it to be but it made a good home for my rabbit. I would recommend this product."
1,Not for rats - save yourself some trouble,"This cage is very well built and a good deal, but it is definitely not for rats. If you have a rat save yourself some trouble and buy one that is specifically designed for rats. The bar spacing in this one is too wide and our rats were out within no time. I'm somewhat annoyed that the manufacturer advertises it as suitable for small pets instead of naming the specific animals for which it would be suitable. We did our research and quite a few of the reviews on amazon.com said that this cage was suitable for rats - they either own Godzilla rats or giant mutant rats from a research gone wrong. This cage is not suitable for normal rats, period!"
5,Wonderful recipes,Recommend this book highly. Good variety of flavor recipes. Also gives helpful tips on cooking these sometimes difficult but well loved desserts.
1,Problems within 24 hours,My T5 crashed within the first 24 hours of use. The unit locked up every time i tried to use the calender. Resetting the device didn't seem to help. Disappointing for a $400 product.
3,Is Palm trying to go Bankrupt?,"I am a self described tech-junkie and have owned 10 different palm OS pda's/phones in the last decade. The T5 has to be the BIGGEST disappointment. There is nothing new or groundbreaking about this ""flagship(??)"" product. NO wifi. No voice recorder. No chrging LED.No charging base.They were ""smart"" enough to introduce a NEW connector that is incompatible with any existing accessories. They also decided that we users did not like metal and opted for a CHEAP PLASTIC case. They even deleted the charging LED!Truly terrible(DUMB!) marketing. With the continuing decrease in PDA sales, especially of Palm OS PDA's, Palm cannot afford any more of this stupidity. I gave it 3 stars only because they did increase the RAM memory to 256mb, BUT only about 160mb is actually available to the user. This is equal to buying a 5 room house and only being able to use 3 rooms. Again truly bad marketing.I'm just hoping another company will step up and release a true Flagship palm PDA soon."
2,Outlook users beware....,"While this handheld is marketed as fully compatible with MS Outlook, my experience as well as the experience of other Palm owners I have seen on their website has been one of frustration and anger. Palms' handhelds do not synchronize with Outlook as easily as they make it seem. After half an hour with their tech support only to be told they don't have a solution for me and I should try Intellisync, I am seriously having buyer's remorse. The whole reason I got a handheld was so I could have a transportable way to carry around my contacts, appointments, and to-dos that I keep track of in Outlook! Buyers beware!!"
2,So far It's a paper wieght,I didn't make a good buy on this but I'm slowly getting to learn how to use it.
4,Almost 5 Stars,"Palm would have been better off including wi-fi instead of Bluetooth on the T5. To get wi-fi, an expensive card must be purchased. The browser capabilities of the T5 are less than desireable, but I do enjoy the ability to use my T5 with my Bluetooth phone and other capable devices."
3,AN OKAY ALBUM...,"I DIDN'T BUY THIS CD...I TAPED IT...BUT I LIKED IT. IF YOU DON'T MIND SONGS THAT HAVE THE WORDS CONSTANTLY REPEATING THEMSELVES, YOU MIGHT LIKE THIS. IT'S VERY REPETITIVE...DON'T BE SURPRISED IF YOU GET MOST OF THE SONGS STUCK IN YOUR HEAD...AND STILL HAVE THEM STUCK AFTER A YEAR OF NOT LISTENING TOO THE ALBUM. I WARNED YOU..."
3,It was ok...,For the most part it was good. But too repetative and empty. I could have thought of these lyrics. But it's good.
2,Cheapo Birdhouse,"This might make a good project for a cub-scout den, but as a functional bird house, it is really cheap. It is so small that it would take a ""miniature bird"" to use it."
5,Four year-olds,"This product comes with pre-drilled nail holes so parents can push the nails into place and have the children (4-year-olds, in my case) hammer them in the rest of the way. The pre-drills for the two eye hooks are a little too big and make sure you add a drop of glue to those holes and the screw thread to ensure the chain does not come loose, or add your own eye hooks.My kids, a son and daughter, loved putting the pieces together, but they loved painting the house even more.These are a great first project."
2,Buildabirdhouse by toysmith,"When including shipping, not a good value for the cost. Directions are poor. Author does not know the difference between 90 degrees and 45 degrees. Roof is not attached to the body of the birdhouse. The directions for attaching the suspension chain are not clear. Probably should not paint as the smell of the paint is likely to keep birds away. The house is small, perhaps too small for a nesting small bird family. Exposed nails are likely to rust.For this total cost, I would expect a more substantial product. This is not apparent from the on-line description of the product."
1,Bad Birdhouse,"The size and quality of this tiny birdhouse is not worth the price. It's not very stable, and I would worry about any bird who choses it to build a nest in. For that reason, I had to retro fit it so that the bottom wouldn't fall out once the weight begins to increase with growing baby birds. The holes in the roof to hang the chain is a poor design. This may be fine for birds in China, but not for the birds in my San Antonio backyard."
4,Bought it for mom,"My mom was in a nursing home and unable to get out shopping. She'd had these bras in the past and loved them. Seems this one worked well for her, too."
5,GIVE YOUR FACE A LOVE PAT...,"I have been using this powder for years. The coverage is excellent, so years ago I stopped using foundation on my face. I really like the light, natural look and the feeling of this product on one's skin. It never looks powdery. I also like the fact that this color is a perfect match for my skin tone. Moreover, the quality of the product is such that it allows one's skin to take center stage by looking its best, providing a beautiful backdrop for one's other cosmetics."
5,Sash! is back!,"Sash! is back and better then ever with this amazing tune Ganbareh, ""La Primavera"" and ""Ecuador"" style. Ganbareh means ""Let's move forward and have fun"" in Japanse. It was originally made for the official FIFA World Cup 2002 album but didn't made it there so it was used for the official ice hockey world cup instead. This cd also feautres the radio version of the double A-side single, ""The Sunset"", wich is more a trancy tune. The new Sash! album will probably come out late september in Europe entiteld: ""S4! Sash!"""
5,Excellent Product,"This harness does exactly what the name implies. It stops the pulling.After six years of being dragged by our 80 + lb husky mix, this thing had her walking like a well mannered dog within seconds of our first walk using it. (It seems like she simply doesn't like the feel of it under her arms when she tries to pull me, so she doesn't pull anymore) An added bonus: because there is no pulling on her neck, she is less likely to bark and be unfriendly when other dogs approach her with it on.If you're tired of being dragged around by your dog, but hate the idea of having to use one of those heavy chain metal chokers to control him/her, don't hesitate to buy this. It works!"
5,Absolute perfection!,I bought this harness thinking that if it worked HALF as well as advertised it would be well worth the money. I have a year old Weimaraner who is a great dog but not so great on the leash. I tried everything with him and dreaded taking him for walks. So I decided to try this product. The difference was astounding and immediate! First time he wore it it was like I was walking a different dog! Bless the developer of this product. Now I can't wait to go on our walks. Thank you!!!!!!
2,sportline 346 pedometer,Sent a replacement that broke. Service was fine as they refunded my money but the replacement which was free was no good.
3,Not as good as past efforts,"I've had ""Visions"" for a while now, and listened to it only seldom. In my opinion, this CD lacks the power and depth of past albums, including the brilliant ""Cosmic Genesis."" There are a few songs on ""Visions"" that stand out, most notably the excellent ""ESP Mirage."" However, most of the CD is uninteresting, though technically proficient. Vintersorg's voice is still excellent, though there are no tracks here that show it off to maximal effect, like ""A Dialoge With the Stars"" did on ""Cosmic Genesis."" I have heard from others that the album is a grower, but I still say try before you buy. It is a decent album, but not excellent by any means. Do yourself a favor and pick up ""Cosmic Genesis"" or any of his past Swedish albums (""Till Fjalls, etc.)."
2,Don't waste your money,"I purchased this item for my husband last Christmas, and the air hose cracked and started leaking air. He swapped mine for his, since he had had a tire that was losing air, and we both drive a distance to work. Anyway, I am purchasing another soon, but DEFININTELY NOT ANOTHER one like this. It did work for a SHORT time, and that's why it's getting two stars instead of one."
1,"Big Flynn Fan, Big Disappointment","I have been looking forward to this book for quite a while, however it was very disappointing. It seemed to me to be two short stories, each with mediocre plots, wrapped up into one book.It almost as if this book was conceived before 9/11 and awkwardly edited to deal with 9/11 afterwards.I would very, very strongly recommend any other Flynn novel."
5,Executive Power by Vince Flynn,"I love the Mitch Rapp series as it is very entertaining and holds your interest throughout the book. Not a book to read if you want to fall asleep, as you may be up all night. The suspense is great, which makes you want to continue reading to find out what happens next."
4,Executive Power,Same Vince Flynn quality. Had to get going to get in Rapp's shoes. Was concerned how he would handle a wife. Would recommend the book. Also a 5 Star for Term Limits. I like how Flynn keeps the action or events plausible - even with the events of todays Washington D.C.
3,Not His Best,"First, let me say that I am a Vince Flynn fan. His excellent ""Consent to Kill"" launched him to the top tier of thriller writers. That being said, ""Executive Power"" is too diffuse. The first half of it has nothing to do with the second. In the first half, Rapp is over in the Philippines rescuing American hostages. In the second, he is tracking a Middle Eastern assassin. Neither story has anything to do with the other. This is really two separate novels. Why Flynn combined them I don't know. Nevertheless, even a mediocre Flynn thriller (because of its lack of focus in this case) is better than most other thrillers being penned nowadays.--Bryan Cassiday, author of ""The Kill Option""The Kill Option"
2,no-brainer,"This book was kind of fun, but only when I kept my brain switched off. Clunky writing and shallow characters are expected in a genre book like this, but there were two points that really didn't work for me.First, the Phillipines and Palestinian plots were totally unrelated. Almost as if he took two incomplete book outlines and shoved them together to make deadline. Lazy lazy lazy.The worst for me was the alternating self-righteousness of the main character about thoughtless Washinton bureaucrats who thought they were above the rules and are therefore bad, as compared with the self-righteousness of the main character about his own definition of his own rules to govern his own actions which must be good. It's ok for him to reveal details about his operations to his wife, for instance."
2,Dissapointed,"The thumbs up from Dan Brown on the front cover enticed me to buy this book in addition to the fact that the book was considered to be a post 9-11 thriller. I almost expected the book to flow like the 24 Hours TV Series, but instead it turned out to be a jumble of different sub-plots that really didn't flow well at all. Some of the characters / sub-plots (Phillippines, the love story) didn't come together quite well. The ""hero"" was a little too macho and not too likeable. It seemed like the author ran out of steam toward the end.My fav character: Prince Omar!Mark"
2,Unnecessary Fluff,"The story started out so, so promising. Unfortunately, it got lost somewhere along the way. Almost like it was exposition rather than serious story telling. More accurately, the book's two separate stories that were forcefully melded into each other for no rhyme or reason other than to add pages. To add insult to injury, neither story is very good standing alone.Take the Abu Sayyaf angle.Q: How does the Abu Sayyaf story relate to Omar and David's?A: It doesn't, other than that Mitch Rapp stars in both, but that's a flimsy reason if you ask me.Worse, the only character with any real depth or complexity, David, dies at the end.Seems to me Flynn's going the way of Mr. Clancy, from very good to extremely mediocre."
3,"Great Flynn book, but the weakest in the Rapp series","I enjoyed this book, but I have to say that it seemed thrown together from several ideas. The strongest new character, David, was a fascinating character that I thought could have used more attention. Prince Omar's character was too cliché for me, and the ending of this book seemed to be too abrupt (I think Flynn realized he was coming up on the 500 page mark :-)). This book really does not add anything to the series' story line, and it could be skipped. I guess that is unacceptable to me as I enjoy every time I crack a Flynn book. This is the weakest of the series, but it is still a good read for the genre."
5,More Lusterious Than The Photo Shows,It looks very nice. The photo looks just a bit more 3D than the pendant but the pendant looks more brightly polished than the photo. I got the recommended 2mm silver popcorn chain after perusing chains. I'm not a big jewelry wearer but when I do it has to be mostly silver or black and never gold. I like wearing a necklace with a pendant many days and like things that are dark or pagan (and it helps counter the gold crosses I see at work lol).
1,garbage musical quality!,"what a garbage this band is! the answer of the german teeny girl band for SPICE GIRLS in the UK. The girls are pretty but they do not show us any capability how they could play any of instruments on stage, and neither they could read any of the musical notes.the germans keep on saying ""SCHROTT"""
4,Movie was better,Bought the book after seeing the movie. I liked the movie much better. I have always liked Jack Higgens books.
1,No Sound,"You only have three choices of stations to use for transmission, two of which were already occupied. The third station should have worked but we were only able to get sound by turing the volume all the way up and even then it was quiet and poor quality. The only good thing was that Amazon was good about the return."
3,Average,"It's ok, however, it doesn't tune the channel real clear. The up side is the USB saves battery life."
2,Kind of disappointing!,Last year I picked up this holiday cd and was disappointed big time; except for a few big hits here & there; the rest sound like album filler to me. The follow up volume 2 isn't much better. If there's volume 3 coming up I hope it's better than these!
1,People please...,I bought because I thought it would have a cool cocktail sound. Wrong! It was obnoxious! I did not even get to the last song. I put it in the shredder so I would never listen to it again by accident.
5,Great as always!,"I was turned onto these stories by a friend of mine severaly years ago, and since then there hasn't been one that I have missed. This is one of my favorites because it sheds light on her other books dealing with the Hamilton family. And yes, things like this do happen in real life. It is a wonderfull book, and I would recomend it and all of her others to anyone, even my grandmother."
3,Informative,Very informative. Some things were helpful. Plan on spending time reading to understand this book.
3,"Simple, But Elegant","A unique vertical pattern that suggests ripples in water glass gives these wine glasses distinguish these glasses from others in their price range. I especially like it because it is subtly different. They are reasonably priced, so I was able to buy them for large dinner parties. Nevertheless, they please me so I treat them with great care."
3,Pretty but fragile,"The wine glasses are very attractive but the narrow stem causes a bit of a balance problem and I've broken four of the eight wine glasses that I've purchased. They are pretty but fragile, so keep this in mind when ordering and realize that you may need to re-order these particular wine glasses often as they will break over time."
5,A good read with interesting points,I was recommended to read this book by a friend at university and i'm glad that he did. Too many business authors waste there time trying to impress themselves with their vocabulary or make a subject too dry to actually enjoy. The Art of Profitability is a refreshing change to the normal way that business books are written. While sometimes the dialogue and commentary can be annoying overall it was an enjoyable read about 23 different business models and how they work. I'd recommend it to anyone wanting to expand their knowledge on business models.
5,Simple Yet Effective,"I thought this book was great! Slywotzky uses this book as a sort of Cliff Notes to his previous books, all of which are probably the best books on strategy out there. This book will appeal to all levels of experience and knowledge, as very simple yet effective business paradigms and principles are explored. The best thing about the simplicity of these principles and the way that Slywotzky delivers them, is that he makes them very easy to apply and take immediate action on. I found myself perusing the Wall Street Journal, spotting them in action or being ignored. It's very short, but some of the references will likely inspire you to go off and explore them. As far as the critique about the plot, I think those reviewers missed the point of the book. Don't read a business strategy book from the VP at Mercer Management Consulting looking for plot twists and character development. Read it because he knows what he is talking about!"
4,Good overall view of Asian-American wedding customs,"Gives equal time to different ethnicities, and points out that the rituals and customs described are generalizations, and that customs vary from region to region. Focuses more on 1st-generation Asian-Americans, but is still useful to a 3rd-gen. Chinese-American like me. The legends, folklore, and poetry sprinkled thru-out the book are beautiful and very touching. Could use a bit more detail in places, but this book is a great place to start investigating Asian wedding traditions."
5,Love my Skagen,"I tried a Skagen watch after someone gave me one for Christmas. I could not keep it on my wrist because the clasp kept coming undone. I returned it. Then after talking to another person who had one, I decided to try another. It was a matter of my understanding how to fasten the bracelet clasp. Now I love it. It never comes off now. I also like the light weight and thinness of the watch and it is quite attractive."
1,Don't buy this watch!!!,"I bought this watch because I liked the mesh band, the thin face, and the overall sleek look. When I got it, I was very happy at first, but after wearing it around for about 2 weeks, the face cracked. I called Skagen's customer service, and they told me that this was a common problem with this watch, and that if I sent it in, they would replce it with a stronger crystal, for free. (Of course I had to pay shipping and handling both ways, which came to about $20 total). So I sent it in and got it back good as new about a month later, which was fine. But then 10 days later, it cracked again!!! I assure you that I wasn't wearing the watch while playing sports or doing anything that would cause it to crack. I looked at my watch, went into Banana Republic to buy a shirt and then looked again and it was cracked. Stay away from this watch."
4,Great design!,"This watch is very light, its thin case and mesh band in titanium are elegant. It seems appropriate for any event as formal or casual.I'm a little bit worried with its crystal quality after read some previous reviews."
3,Broken pin,"Had this watch just three days and the pin that joins the strap to watch has bent. Was not dropped or maltreated. Seems to me that all the pressure is on the middle so is bound to distort whereas if this ""collar"" was longer would be impossible to bend. Pity otherwise very smart."
1,CRACK,"Bought a Skagen as spare, kept in a draw and the glass cracked without wearing - looked on the internet and hey, this is normal!"
4,Nice and slim,"It was delivered on time. the watch is very nice and seems pretty resistant. I've already hit it against car door, no scratch...The only thing missing is light."
2,"Great watch, until the latch on the band broke","I have had this watch in a zip loc bag for the last year! I have taken the watch to several watch stores...and they cannot fix it as the (tricky) latch on the watch has to be soldered back on to the band! This watch lasted on my arm for less than a month. This is a sever disappointment as the watch is not inexpensive!On the plus side, the watch is very handsome."
4,Call Me -- First Song I Ever Did the Dog To with A Girl,"I'll never forget the song, Call Me. I was in middle school probably 5th or 6th grade. Around that time I was allowed to attend the gym jams on Friday nights in my little hick town. I remember doing the dog with the cutest girl in the whole school, Natasha Cherry. Every time I hear this song it brings back memories of a simpler time in the early 80s - musty gym, acting grown, foggy schoolbus windows, tight Jordache jeans, and puberty. Long story short. I have one of their greatest hits CD's but only listened to Call Me. One Saturday night while home with nothing to do I checked out the remaining tracks. Man did I sleep on them. About 80% of the tracks are first rate but I just don't remember them getting much airplay on AM or FM stations back in the day."
4,DONT BE AFRAID OF THE WAY YOU FEEL!!!,"THIS IS ME ONCE AGAIN, THE SONG TITLE OF THE SONG WITH THE VERSE OF ""DONT BE AFRAID OF THE WAY YOU FEEL"" IS CALLED ""ITS' REAL LOVE"", I'M ALMOST 100% SURE. THE MAN IN ""BAHRAIN CLOSE TO HUSSEIN""!!!!"
4,SKYY IS THE LICK!,"Skyy is one of the best groups from the 80s. I still love ""Call Me"" that song is the cut! I love the breakdown. You can groove out to that song. Skyy shouldn't be forgotten, they had talent!"
2,bang bang bang bang fizzzzzzzzzzzzz,"i like PKD, and this was an amazing 5-star novel... up until the end, where it plummeted straight down in a shooting stream of crap for the last 40 pages or so and never came back up. i hoped, i wished, i prayed, and it still went straight into the toilet. PKD, like jim thompson, was a great 220-page writer who for money's sake was forced to write 180-page books and could never really get the hang of it. his visions were much more suited towards lengthier books. if you're interested in his work, read ""man in the high castle"" or UBIK or ""scanner darkly."" don't start here."
1,Nothing to Like,"Well over a decade past, OUP promised a suite of OUP publications it never delivered. It finally released the OED and SOED. This review is of the latter only.I've installed SOED on three different systems, and it not only crashes all three, it stalls them, so that I have to unplug and restart. After 3 x 10 x 10, I no longer bother.The features of the full OED are bare outline (when I can see them). The scholarship of the full OED is NOT this edition, and not worth ANY price.So, after 15 years, I still must resort to the paper product. So why did I buy the electronic version? So WordPerfect cannot decipher common words? Yes, the SOED coopts WP's spell check, but any word after the 15th century is unrecognized.Now, the SOED is not allowed on any of my systems."
5,Great supplement,The authors did an excellent job of meshing the d20 system with Mr. Jordan's world. This book allows you to bring your favorite characters to life and to build new ones remarkably faithful to the world.
5,One of the best personal accounts of a falconer.,I read this book some 25 years ago. Several times in fact. I am delighted to find that it is back in print! The trials and triumphs described are great lessons for experienced as well as novice falconers. A good object lesson for analyzing the personal preparations for handling such a large and powerful raptor.
1,WATERD DOWN TO THE POINT OF RIDICULOUS!!!!!,"SAVE YOUR MONEY ON THIS ONE, ITS SO WATERED DOWN THAT YOU WON'T EVEN RECOGNIZE THIS ANYMORE. SAVE YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY FOR SOMETHING THAT IS WORTH WHILE THEN HAVING SOMETHING YOU CAN GET AT THE 98 CENT STORE LIKE THIS!!!!!!!"
1,Not worth it,"Ten minutes after I opened the box I found two cards with errors. I think the information presented is too basic, and a lot of it is not very well suited to flashcards. You'd be better off buying the book."
3,Tarzan's Three Challenges,Tarzan's Three ChallengesTarzan's Three Challenges was a good and entertaining film. I'm glad I bought it. It met my expectations.
4,The Latimore Series,"Bringing Up Babies is the story of Hope Latimore (the ""baby"" of the Latimore family) and Ralph Browne. Having been pampered her whole life, Hope has floated from one job to another, until an old schoolmate needs a nanny for his niece and nephew. It is a delightful story with a lot of cute scenes. (Other Latimore books include Tempted By Fire, Faith Hope and Marriage, Latimore Bride)"
1,"Life 101, How to Heal Depression","For someone suffering from depression, listening to this tape made it worse. I was looking for answers, encouragement and a reason to believe there was hope. Listening to someone speak for a few seconds and then listen to a depressing oldie and birds chirping made me want to throw it out of the window."
3,A BASIC SUMMARY OF THE OTHER MODULES,"This book was ok. I read it and passed ist time (now CCNP qualified) but I found the book a little woolly on MOST areas!!!This book will only help you pass if you have already taken and passed the the other CCNP modules ie Routing, Switching and Remote Access as well as the CCNA. Otherwise the book is a basic summary tool. There is a lot of wasted space on outputs from commands hence the bulkiness pof the book!!! However if you only need to brush up your skills before the exams this will do. Overall Todd's done a good job on his series of CCNP books. REDUCE THE TYPOS THOUGH!!!"
2,pretty good..if you like intelligent drum and bass,"i got this as a gift..but if you don't care much for intelligent dnb, then you better look for some other cd to purchase...not much jump up etc.."
1,Seafood Gumbo receipe was not kitchen tested,"If you cook shrimp for over an hour, it will be tough and rubber-like. The shrimp in the above receipe should be added 10 minutes before serving!"
1,Painfully bad,"This film is painfully bad on all fronts. Acting- you could see the actors eyes moveing as they read que cards. Idea- an albino boy can go invisible, a highschool student can solve an equasion describing how to build a cloaking devise, and a spooky government agency is after everyone. Plot and wrighting- juvenile and pathetic. Filming- an inexpensive hand held.Don't waist your time or money on this one."
3,I got mine autographed!,"A Christmas album by Rudy Ray Moore? Yes, it is. The CD opens with the only song on the album, which is the R&B classic ""Merry Christmas Baby"". Rudy does a good job with the vocals (he was an R&B singer before he was a comedian). This is a decent version of the song. The rest of the album consists of Rudy's raunchy comedy routines. The best routine here is ""Night Before Christmas (Part 1)"", which is a hilariously filthy version of the well known poem. The rest of the material is somewhat uneven, and it should be noted that many of the jokes have nothing to do with Christmas. I also should mention that the sound quality of the CD is not that great. It sounds like it was copied off of an old LP that has a few scratches on it. But Rudy Ray Moore fans will still dig it."
1,This book sucks,"I think the new Ashleigh books suck. It seems like ""all"" of the authors have forgotten about the original THOROUGHBRED series. I say stop pelting out the ashleigh books and go back to the originals."
2,NOT low lint,"Thick towels but shed, even after washing. Don't wash with anything else but other towels. Seem to have good color saturation. Nothing special, but better than most discount store brands. I'd probably pay a little more for better quality next time."
2,Not authentic,"Sadly the rendition of the to me familiar songs is disappointing. I should have known something was not up to par, as the feature to listening to a few bars was missing -- so, against my better judgment I ordered the cd anyway. Again, because of my familiarity with the ""old"" tunes. The recording sounds like it's speeded up, the instrumental part is simple and repetitious and sounds like something out of a latin country instead of Germany. The yodeling shows no nuances. To put an end to my misery I just gave the cd away."
3,"Ok, for what it was","There was nothing in here I hadn't seen before, but it was a free offer, so I didn't mind. While the Avatar movie was fun--I am much more interested in the technical aspects of the film; I love CGI animation"
4,Murder on the Mind,It is a very interesting book. First time I have read a book by L.L. Bartlett. I really enjoyed reading it. Could hardly put it down.
2,Not Exciting,"Reads like someone was trying out a ""My First Novel"" writing kit. Sort of like looking at a paint by numbers picture. It's all there and you can tell what is, but it just isn't any good."
2,Just ok,"Boring no real story, It just ends. I did find it entertaining though. I wish the author went further into the characters."
2,Not so much of a mystery,The writing and the executive/investigative process was good but who did what was not hard to figure out. All the evidence pointed to one person almost the whole time.
4,Good Read,Story line interesting and easy to follow.Able to pick up story with a number of short reads.Enjoyable entertainment.
4,Good late night read.,"I liked the story line and the way it makes you feel like you are the person in the book. However, I wish there had been a little more mystery to it. Kind of like 'you think you know who did it but it turned out you didn't' type thing. But I really enjoyed it and will buy the next Resnick mystery because I love the writer's style."
2,Average,I found this book somewhat entertaining but had no trouble putting it down. Nothing original in the plot. The final resolution stretched credibility especially attempted murder in a packed church.
4,Murder on the Mind by L.L. Bartlett,"I thought this story was great! I like the way the story of Jeff's ""gift"" evolves as well as the way his relationship with his brother grows. A really good read and a story that flows well.I would definitely recommend!"
3,quick and entertaining,"I am intrigued to read the other Jeff Resnick novels as Bartlett creates a compassionate, if reluctant hero in this introduction to the series."
5,Murder on the Mind review,Loved the story. Lots of story twists and steady character development. Interaction with police officials was sketchy though. Could have been a bit longer for my taste.
3,Murder on the Mind,"It was an interesting book, fast enough to keep you going. Decent plot and I would get the next book from this author"
3,a good fast gutsy read...,This plot moved at a good pace. The 'hero' is believable and likable. I would read more books by this author
4,Good story,"Good story that kept my attention. Only negative is that after all the build up, it ended very abruptly. Bit of a let-down."
2,Bad start but improves,"I'm not sure if this was badly edited at the beginning or not, but I found it very strange & jumping all over the place for the first quarter of the book, but it did settle down and although is not destined to be one of 'The Greats' of literature, ended up being a decent read."
3,Something missing...,"I don't know why I didn't find this book more interesting. It had a lot to recommend it. I suppose the fact that the mystery of who dunit was solved pretty early in the story kept it from holding my attention as I felt it should. Or maybe I found the main character a little immature in his relations with his brother and that put me off. In any event, I found something was missing. However I will read more of this series because it is intriguing. Perhaps I will find what is missing in future novels."
4,Loved it,"I got totally caught up in the mystery. The author did a great job at portraying the 'gift' of ESP as something plausible to occur in an average person. The entire tale, for me, was believable. I will be looking for more from this author"
3,Eh,Could have been better. Will still recommend the book and will probably read more books by this author.But good book.
4,The mind can do marvelous things,Enjoyed the twists and turns as the case was being solved. Will certainly read future books and love not having the end figured out at the beginning. Great!
3,Relaxing read....,"Whilst not a brilliant read I found the book great beach entertainment. Easy to lay back, relax and find myself wanting to know what was going to happen next."
4,Easy go,Very entertaining. Will read more Jeff Resnick Mysteries. Not to heavy or hard to follow. Easy read and great characters.
4,Great Book,"I loved this book,it was a easy read...kept you hooked, i will read the others in the series. totally recommend"
5,Book review,This book kept me wanting to find out more and was amazing. I cant wait to read his other books.
4,An interesting read,"It had a great plot and some likable characters. There were many twists and turns included, though it was quite predictable. I would recommend it for people searching for a nice simple read."
4,an enjoyable read,"this was an enjoyable read. the characters were nicely developed and i enjoyed the interplay between the main three characters. the ""mind element"" (trying not to spoil it for other readers here...) was cute and a nice way to keep me swiping the pages forward. i found the level of snarkiness just right. (snark, sarcasm, dry wit - they speak to me...lulz) along with the good writing and suspense, that kept me coming back and laughing while reading. i REALLY enjoyed how the author wove in the issues of race, marriage, relationships and wealth (or lack thereof). i look forward to reading more from this author."
4,this is a different genre,"i liked this book. It was a different genre for me. I like mystery & psychics, so it was a good combination. The family story line is interesting, too. If you like a good murder mystery and a quirky, not so perfect hero, you'll like this book."
3,simple but entertaining,"Chararacters are likeble, plot moves along and ending was satisfying. Can see that a series was being introduced. Might read another. Overall, a pleasureable read but not much depth."
3,Murder on the mind,"This book had a slow start, but the ending was good. I think it would have been better if it had more action & mystery."
3,First E-book and I'll go back for more,"If you are able to believe in the physic possibilities of this world you will enjoy it greatly. Truth is this was my first eBook and I tried it as it was free.Regardless of my above comments Bartlett is a good writer. Keeps the pace moving along. I sometimes wanted to strangle Jeff Resnick, but that actually draws you more into the plot, as you start to believe in it."
4,An interesting mystery,"I really liked this book. It has everything...paranormal, sibling relationships, and good character studies. It was touch and go right up to the end as to who did it and how!"
5,Murder on themind,Great book. Once I started reading it I didn't want to put it down. Great story from start to finish. Will definitely try other books from this author.
5,Great way to learn Italian,"I lived in Italy for 9 months and when I got there I didn't speak a word. I had lots of books and resources for learning the language, but this book was the best for learning grammar and conjugation. It very clearly lays out all of the most essential Italian grammar and is very easy to learn from. This book combined with a good Italian/English dictionary is the way to go for learning Italian!"
5,Great little helper!,"I used this book extensively when I spent three months in Sicily. It's small enough to carry everywhere, easy to read and understand. It was helpful to me on many occasions. I highly recommend it."
2,got the wrong song,"The CD came quickly and undamaged. But because it didn't have a link to listen to the songs, I got the wrong music. I was looking for the song ""In Christ Alone"" Now I know that the one I wanted is not the one on the CD. It's nice to able to preview the music."
1,Threw it away imediately.,"Bad, cheap quality. Doesn't fit perfectly on a t60. It came with a little sticker on the sleeve a barcode or something. When I removed it, it actually tore a part of the leather off the case!"
3,Almost square..,"These are cute cutters and come in a nice range of sizes. Unfortunately several of the edges curve a bit, making them not perfectly square. The steel is sturdy enough so that it is not easy to bend them to the proper shape."
5,Nicely packaged books,Delivery was quick and my books arrived in superior condition. My nephew was very happy that we were able to find such a beautiful copy for this collection!
3,Caves readings,"The book started with an interesting topic about searching for treasure, However it soon shifted from a cave story into detective work by the Hardy Boys."
2,boring,This book is a waste of time. I do not recommend it at all. I was so glad when I was done with it. I try and keep an open mind when I read books but this was just awful. Don't waste your time. The charecters are flat and the story killed itself.
2,The cave collapsed.,I think this book is the worst Hardy Boys book ever.This book is so poor I think it wasn't even made by Franklin W. Dixon.I would give it one star but I have to give it some credit.Listen to me and don't get this book.
2,Cave Canem,"Those of you who were forced to study Latin know the old joke: ""Cave Canem."" It's Latin for ""Beware of Dog.""And this story is a definite dog. Already this early in the series, ""F.W. Dixon"" has started cannibalizing his own work, thinking that hanging about caves is somehow exciting or mysterious.Let's face it: caves are dreary, dark, damp and dismal. What sort of real entertainment is afforded here?And besides, about halfway through this story you forget what the boys were looking for. However, in the revised version, there are a great many fun references to the much-discredited 1964 New York World's Fair, especially the huge Uniroyal ferris wheel that they made look like a big whitewall tire.Guaranteed to break the ice at parties, that is."
2,Disappointing,"This razor has no button or notch or anything to assist in getting the top off so that you can clean out the hairs, etc. It's designed for you to just YANK it off - well that doesn't always work so well and I have twisted the blade inside while doing this and just barely got it back on. The reason I say ""twisted the blade"" is the second big problem - there is no actual blade! It's a flat piece of metal (thin & moldable) with holes in it (like a cheese grater) that lays up against a motor and this is what goes against your body to shave. Also the manual says to get a new ""blade"" every year - so you have to keep all the mailing info and order it yearly from the manufacturer! Keep looking - there must be a better razor out there!"
5,to jesus hes king of kings and lord of lords,i have listened to this praise and worship christmas cd on line over and over again because its so wonderful and i love it and you would to its the best cd ive ever heard its wonderful relaxing and will fill your heart with complete joy and the singer and songwriter don moen i give you thanks i love all the songs you make but this one tops it all praise worship christmas is so wonderful i really hope people will listen to it and buy it you wont be sorry that you did and it will make happy thank you very much lorna inman
5,O Melhor De Chico Buarque,"I love Chico Buarque. His music is very sensitive, his words build a very delicate and depth poetry."
3,Okay . . . seen better,"Trading Spaces fans for a while, back when it was popular I guess...so we bought the book. Not as great as we thought at first (most likely why we don't watch the show anymore either).Information in it seemed very basic - not ground breaking, and next time we will check out options at a bookstore first. Personal choices here too. Some people like walls with colors, some like white only, some wood.Some very good basics in the book, but doubt I would pay full price for the set again!"
3,the music hunter,"Although I've become active in downloading many MP3 songs from Amazon (most of which I have on LP or Cassette), I find it to be sorely lacking in the funk/R&B era represented by the likes of Midnight Star, The SOS Band,GQ,Pleasure, to name just a few. The reality is that I started the Amazon collaboration in hopes of delaying [even foregoing]the acquisition of a vinyl-to-digital converter, and overall it's been a great experience; however,downloading the MP3s available brings to my mind the really great cuts desired for me to have a universally well-round digital library. Yet, I cannot download due to no availability, and it is becoming evident there is a void not fulfilled through the Amazon.com product; I'm now forced to make a decision to get a converter - since most of my MP3 downloads I already have in one form or another."
4,good,"great cd brings back memories,,only thing songs not in order they are listed but all there just mixed up from lable"
2,Really poor device.,"I've only reviewed one product here in the past, but I had to comment on this one. I used to own one of these a long time ago and it was a very good unit. This one has really LOW power and speed using any common toothpaste I found. The battery charge retention is way below that of competing units. The concept of the rotating tufts is excellent, but the execution is bad. I ended up replacing it after two weeks with an Oral-B Professional. Much better."
2,A little disappointed.,"I was real excited to find this electric toothbrush for such a reasonable price.However when I got it home and started to use it I was a little disappointed. The bristles of the brush are very small and spread far apart.The movement of the head is too subtle.The main disappointment is that the vibration of the head will stop if too much pressure is placed against the teeth.You have to learn how to use it with the right amount of pressure.I use it and like the size of the brush for getting way back in the mouth, but I will most likely purchase a more expensive brush real soon."
5,Hah!,"I disagree with all the characteizations in the first three reviews of this film; They Came To Cordura. I found the film fascinating, complex, thought provoking, and above all well acted. It's too bad Tab Hunter got pigion-holed as a prettyboy--the talent he showed in this film, shows he could have been a 'serious actor'. I don't believe that anyone accustomed to television could ever 'get' a film like this...they have been dumbed down to the point of...well, I can't even put it in polite language. One more thing; Cooper is Cooper, he has always been. He has a peculuar dilivery to his speech. One either likes it or not. I love the guy, and Rita finally got a chance to REALLY act in this one--it's worth it for that alone to see the film."
4,Unfairly neglected partial masterpiece,"They Came To Cordura was taken away from director Robert Rossen by the studio and re-edited. Forty-five minutes were cut from its two-and-a-half hour running length and some 15 minutes were tossed back in to clarify ""motivation."" There are moments in this extraordinary film of utter brilliance, especially Gary Cooper's shattering portrayal of a coward forced to face the weakness within. Unfortunately, the studio's meddling throws the pacing and intensity of mood out of whack. However, it is still a riveting, challenging film, one which deserves a better fate than its neglect by critics. Director Rossen was in the act of buying back the rights to re-edit the film back to his own cut when he died unexpectedly. Perhaps someone will still do this. It is still a very worthwhile film, flawed masterpiece though it is."
5,Major Crimes watched on computer,"Since this program is on at the same time as another program that I watch, it has been great that I can watch it ""online"" and not miss it."
3,Good But Not That Good,"I just received these headphones to replace my Pioneer HDJ-1000's that broke after about 8 years. I know they're $27 dollars here but they retail for $80 right???? Anyway, the packaging was nice. I pulled the headphones out anxious to try them but found them a bit cheap feeling with all plastic construction. I plugged them in to listen using winamp and found the sound was good at low volume but as I increased the sound it became distorted quickly and unbearable to listen to. I'm quite disappointed but I don't monitor the sound that much. I just use them to que the next song or compare the beat. It'll do fine for that. They did cover my ears but after a half of hour or so I was glad to take them off. As I said, they're good but not that good. You get a $27 pair of headphones and that's it!"
5,Best Electric Razor I have Ever Owned,"I bought one of these for myself - got it - tried it and could not believe and electric razor could be so good. I am 54 years old and have never been impressed with an electric razor - they are always just used for a ""quick touch up"" and an actual blade is used to shave. Well, let me tell you - I use this little baby all the time - it is awesome and I was so impressed I ordered on for each of my Granddaughters for Christmas and they both love them as well - this is just AWESOME!"
4,Remington Shaver for Women,This is a GREAT shaver. Large head glides over legs smoothly and shaves a wide swath. Easy to use. The only problem is in cleaning by hand. Once the head comes off it is difficult to refasten. It took me 35 minutes to get the shaver put back together. Now I will clean with the unit and liquid. Otherwise a good choice to shave legs.
4,Does what it is meant to do,"This product delivers exactly what it says it will. It's a fine, sturdy shaver that I find fits my hand very well. I've had no problem with nicks or cuts (as some other reviewers reported). The cleaning cycle is a bit noisy, but not excessively so. I just hit the clean button as I'm leaving the room and let it buzz away! I'd buy this product again and recommend it without any hesitation."
5,great product,Excellent product. Way better than the Panasonic (that didn't actually remove any hair) and the Philips (that worked ok but was very slow). Would highly recommend.
1,DoA,"I bought this shaver at the super low price. The charging light never lit up upon plugging it in. The shaver could not establish a charge. I called the manufacturer and they said the batteries (which are not replacable) were dead because the unit was old and discontinued. I would not buy this product, even though the price has been slashed drastically. Chances are the unit is obsolete."
4,Remington WDF-7000 Smooth & Silky Wet/Dry Recharge,"Nice shaver, wish it had an underarm guard,I cut myself everytime I try to shave myunderarms with it, works great on my legs.Love the cleaning system, not sure whereto buy the cleaning solution for it."
2,Sux,This rechargeable razor battery life is not worth the price. the battery only lasted 18 mts before it would not take a charge anymore. Not worth the money...........
3,Helpful book for moms of teens,A good jumping off point for moms searching for a way to relate to their daughters. No earth shattering information but it is concrete with useful suggestions. Would recommend it to someone looking for much needed advice. The most helpful aspect of the book is it's description of adolescence as a developmental stage. It normalizes what many go through as their daughters begin to separate from the family in a sometimes overwhelming way.
3,Ok Slim case,The case is nice and slim as the picture shows and it looks pretty slick but the down side is that this case gets dirty pretty easily. So within a few weeks or maybe even days its color (white) will change to a darker dirtier color.
3,I never received this!,BEWARE:Amazon sent this to an old address in their file so I had to pay for this on my credit card even though I never received it.
3,philips,difficult to know what type of replacement to order model type on razor unreadable I order wrong type
3,Not the right product,"I went with 3 stars for neutral because I ordered what I thought was razor heads compatible with my razor, but they weren't. So far the return process has been easy though."
5,Very happy,"I first ordered this product in Oct 2008, along with a apply for a creditcard that would give me $30 reduction on my next order.. The product wasnever sent to me and also I was told my credit card had been canceled, SoI reordered the same product in JAN 2009. It was shipped out in very little time and placed on the credit card they told me they had canceled.I never mentioned anything about my $30 bonus so I never had a chance toapply it to the next order which I still have on hold. Now I wonder whyyou offer a $30 deduction on the next order if you never really meant it.If this falls into the right hands,,,I would like to use the $30 deductionfor another Philips Norelco HQ55 Reflex Replacement Head.. The first oneworks like a dream...Order No. 24692169025000326483812 I think this isthe order number...On the first order of this product last year..P & Hwere also waived..Now if this still hold water..ship me another one.Dean Parpart"
3,Philips HQ55,Philips HQ55 great product was a hard to find. Glad I was able to find it but think it might have been open before.
5,VERY PLEASED,"I was delighted to find these on Amazon- for some reason Norelco has a number of different replacement blades for their electric shavers and they're not easy to find. What an asset Amazon is, especially at a time when gas prices are so high!!!!"
1,Shaver does not remove facial hair easily,I am unhappy with the Philips Norelco HQ 55 Reflex Replacement Heads. It does not remove facial hairs easily. Perhaps the heads I received were defective. Is It possible to mail these heads back and get a replacement?Bea
1,Wrong item sent,I was sent the wrong item. I was sent HQ55 instead of HQ55Plus. Had to send it back. Still need the HQ55Plus.
3,Pricey replacement heads,"The heads are just fine and work fine in two of my razors, the only drawback is the price which is more than half the price of a new razor at local stores."
1,not what was shone,ordered hq 55 as pictured and came hq 56. boy can;t trust anybody any more just will buy offline at walmart or so.
4,Norelco Replacement Heads,"Received the item in record time, and in good condition.Saved money buying replacement heads (as opposed to buying a whole new razor!) and didn't have to go from store to store to find them - Good deal!"
3,"some bad, some good","When you just buy replacement shaver blades, you can't give an honest opinion because I don't know how long they will last. So I decided to buy another set of blades. The last set. which usually lasts a year(the first set) lasted only 6 months. I was really disappointed in them. So since the first set lasted 12 months, I decided to by a third set. As I said, I can't rate this set until I see how long they last."
4,Great,"Replacement for older Norelco heads. Much sharper, producing a smoother cut, and no rash. Has continued staying sharp, 6 months."
4,Shipped in huge box! Really Amazon??,"Good price for these blades. 5 stars for them.However, Amazon shipped this item measuring 4""x5""x1"" in a box measuring 10""x7""x3"".1 star for Amazon on this. I found this really unnecessary. Shame on you Amazon."
4,Raw Food Diet,"This book is designed for folks who are interested in feeding their dogs a natural diet. It seems to be a precusor to the Barf Diet Books. It is technical in it's approach but describes a recommended diet which takes about two sentences. For anyone who feeds this type of diet to their dogs this book gives an excellent rationale for doing so. Although currently there is a ""feud"" going on between the author and those involved in BARF diets. In my opinion they are basically the same and only differ at the fringes."
3,"Good ideas, but boring.","I love the idea of a raw diet for dogs and I agree with his views on commercial petfood.I just got really sick of reading about dental issues. It seems like 80% of this book is about dental hygeine.The book should be named ""Raw Meaty Bones promote Dental Hygeine"", not ""Health"".I also feel he should've given more in-depth information on what to feed/ how to feed.He is also a proponent of feeding wings and backs alone- that is just TOO MUCH BONE.If you look at a whole prey animal, the percentage of bone in it will be 8%-12%. Chicken wings/ backs alone are 50% bone. They are not a biologically appropriate way of feeding!He does deserve credit for stating that whole prey is best, though.Lonsdale has great ideas, but he should've published a separate book about canine dental health, or not gone off about it so much, and his specific diet recommendations are lacking/ somewhat misleading."
4,Good Basic Shoe,"This is a good basic heel that is not too high, not too dressy, that will serve for many occasions when you don't have time to run out and buy something. I enjoy wearing navy as a fashion color and I like to have a good basic navy heel on hand that will transition from one occasion to another. This little heel does that wonderfully."
4,"A comfortable, basic, leather dress shoe.","I was needing to find an all purpose shoe for work that didn't have a 2+ inch heel and after looking a bit and reading reviews I decided to try this shoe in Black and I'm happy I did. I wear anywhere between a 8.5-9.5 depending on the brand, so with this I chose to order a 9 and it was almost perfect. The heel is a good size for extended wear and the leather has started to soften and flex a bit now that I've been wearing them off and on for the last month. It's a very simple shoe that wears well with my work slacks and I'm now considering ordering another in Pewter."
3,a sticker where?,"Great product but this is a GIFT pack and was purchased as a gift. When I recieved it there was a large orange sticker on the front of the box that said ""gift pack"". No kidding! Anyway sticker is very ugly and covers part of picture on box. Sticker did not come off without pulling picture off box either. Gift packaging doesn't look so nice now. The sticker was very unneccessary!"
5,IT WAS A GIFT,"It was very cute. I bought it for a Birthday Gift for a 2 year old. Don't know how age approiate it is, but the little boy loved it. May have to put it up until he is a little older though. I thought when i purchased it that it was made out of a rubber substance, did not know it was metal. But all in all it was very cute and was liked by the child."
4,Real realism,"Well explained, well argued consensus on the realist point of view and why we must adopt such a view for our forgein policy."
1,shameful mastering,"the mastering on this is shameful, its so loud its a joke! I have been transfering New Order records from the 80s and they sound so much better than this overly loud bombast crap collection! This release mastering ruins what made New Order so great, their dynamics... this release goes down as pure disapointment with me, because the song list is amazing, and the 7"" versions are rare... I would rather have a streight vinyl transfer of all these tracks and just simply normalized.. thats all i need, instead of this disasterious clipped out unlistenable mastering because it will ruin your speakers and ears! Terrible! .."
2,i got so mad at it i threw it,"How can people like this product? yes the shaving gel does prevent irritaion but it doesnt even give you a close shave. I have to keep going over the same spot over and over until my skin hurts. It leaves uncut hairs everywhere, at one point i got so fed up after going over this one spot 5 times that i threw the thing on the ground. Let me say the thing takes a beating but it still is the worst shave i have had. I think im goign back ot a wet shaver from now on."
3,A fantastic effort with some great songs,"This album has some amazing tracks on it. The two that caught my attention the most are Never Enough, a great rock song with power and emotion and Chasing the Dragon, a bit of an epic with acoustic beginnings and a great powerful mid section and a quiet closing section. These two songs make this album place highly in my music collection. However on the whole the album isn't my style. I wish I could say I love this album but I'm not into the one aspect of this genre where the male vocalist growls or grunts. There is a fair amount of that on this album, along with what I call machine gun drums. If you like this, you'll love it, if you prefer the ""all female"" vocal style in this genre then this album may not be for you.I still play the songs I like often and this is a tremendous accomplishment for the band. Definitely worth a listen to see it you will like it."
2,Still trying to like this album....,"Wow...I hate to be the only naysayer in the group, but....Production-wise, I found this album to be top-notch. The orchestrations were done very well. However, I found the majority of the songs on this album to be....well....forgettable. None of the songs really stood out to me like they did on Epica's ""Consigned To Oblivion"" album.As for Simone Simons' beautiful voice...the more I hear it, the more I become convinced that she's in the wrong band. The songwriting just doesn't utilize Ms. Simons' amazing vocals enough, in my opinion. It's almost as if the band is competing with itself. While I appreciate growly vocals as much as the next sweaty headbanger, they just turned me off on this album.All in all, I just did not find this album as memorable and accessible as their previous offering. I hope their next is better."
3,Almost Awesome,Epica tries so hard to be Nightwish and they almost succeed. They have wonderful instruments and an opera lead singer who sends chills up my spine. Then this heavy idiot starts growling into the microphone and my ears start to bleed. 5 stars when the growling demon is silent. 3 stars when he is not.
2,momemtary brilliance interrupted by long bouts of boredom,"You get a lot of traction when the Beatles, in any timeframe or form, have said that you're their favorite ANYTHING. What I didn't realize, though, is that their praise was probably uttered at a time when Sgt. Pepper was in their ears and eyes, so that anything which sounded complimentary at best, and imitative at worst, would be their artist of the moment.The nuts and bolts - there are about 2-3 great songs here. Truly great. The rest is mostly filler. A decent approach is to download the two or three songs you like and not buy the rest. Anyone want to buy my CDs? :)(clearly, ""Everybody's Talkin'"" and ""One"" are the big show stealers)"
2,14 and up,"I wasn't too impressed with this book. When I saw it at the bookstore I was interested because I thought it would be a nice story about Spain. Plus, I take Spanish so it just seemed right. Well this isn't some cute Spanish story. It's more geared for 14 and up. I think the characters, Ruth and Tom, were overdone and you could have lived without some parts of the book. Laura was a nice character, but I didn't like her that much toward the end of the book. It just seemed like the story went all wrong. I doubt I'll be reading anything else by Kate Cann. :("
5,OMG!,OMG! when i read this book i thought omg this is soo boring at the beginning but once laura met juan i waz like omg here we go! so yeh this book rocked my socks!
3,A Hosh Posh of sinful sounds that hits and misses,"I bought this for Drinking in LA, but appreciate the delving into some experimental sounds...some of it works, some of it doesn't. If you're open minded, you might enjoy this one. Go ahead, take a chance for 12.99."
1,One hit wonder,"I bought this album for THAT song. And I still love that song, but I'd have been better off buying the single, something that I remind myself of everytime I see this album lying at the bottom of the heap largely unlistened to. It really is not up to much at all. I tried listening to it a few times in the vain hope that the songs would grow on me... but they didn't. Don't buy this unless you know you like more than one song on it. Otherwise, you may well be disappointed."
4,Chill out Rock,"A friend of mine once described Bran Van 3000 as ""sort of laidback, grovetastic kinda just outta bed and drinking a few beers cause you're out of corn flakes again kind vibe goin' down with 'em. sort of beck meets the eel with a black chick on lazy harmonies. soul but the couldn't really give a f#@* about sounding excited or sexy about it."" .He brought the Cd back from florence with him,and i have to admit i was very impressed."
3,Skank- the new direction,"If you're looking for more of the same great happy pop from Skank, turn away now. This new sound is more acoustic, more grunge, more folk-rock than the previous danceable reggae-tinged pop that caught my attention. While the sound is a departure from the other albums, it is still a likeable sound. It doesn't excite or motivate unexpected dancing fits like the older stuff, but it makes good background music."
4,A Groundbreaking Line Up,"If you are a Weather Report Fan, you will know about their various member changes over the years. This is the line up that brought us Heavy Weather. Joe Zawinul and Wayne Shorter of course. Jaco Pastorius, Manolo Badrena, and Alex Acuna are present here. This DVD marks a time where Weather Report was at its peak! They did a great job on remastering this for DVD. This is Jazz history!! There will never be another Weather Report. I highly recommand this DVD. This is a concert from the 70s. If you never heard of Zawinul, Shorter, or Pastorius, then you better ask somebody!"
2,Wishing and Hoping,"This book seems to have a good intention, but it sadly misses the mark. A wonderful collection of historical images, mixed with wishful thinking. Verses are articulated as prayers (may, let), which only serve to point out this book's greatest omission: the object of prayer, who is Creator God himself, who graciously fashioned our precious little ones. Without glorifying the Giver of Life, these thoughts and wishes just evaporate into thin air."
4,Good material for beginning C programmers,"This book is an excellent resource for a beginning C programmer that needs to explore the data structures that make up common programs. Things such as queues, stacks, hash tables, and recursion are covered in-depth, yet are understandable. The program examples build on each other to offer a good insight into practical examples of how to use the material convered."
1,Poorly Organized and confusing,"I greatly regret forcing this text on my students. This course is the first exposure to such difficult concepts as recursion, double pointers, and ADT's; and to present this material with a text so poorly organized has been a travesty. The material may be accurate, but piecing it together into a cohesive whole has required more work on my part than if I had used no text at all. To make matters worse, the code supplied is buggy and documented poorly or not at all. DO NOT USE THIS TEXT!"
1,Just a plain below average text of C++!,"The book does not flow well. The analysis are incomplete. The style is good. A much better book by far is by William Ford, Data Structures with C++ 1996 Prentice Hall. Ford does a super job with the logic of data structures. ISBN is 0024209716."
5,This is still a superb album,"The album's major hit was Rock Steady, but it's no match to the rest of the album. Both I Want You and Special F/X are heavy on the funkiness! A one-two punch back to back as the setup to Rock Steady! Special F/X sounds very close to something Janet Jackson would have done on her Control album, but it still sounds great for the Whispers. The title song, Give It To Me, the dramatic In The Mood, and the sparse No Pain No Gain are all superb songs. The keyboard-heavy '80s sound matches well with the group's rich harmonies. It is still one of my favorite Whispers' albums!"
5,Phenom country!!!!!!!!!!!,"This band is an unfortunate casualty of corporate music. The sound is full with harmonys that rival STYX, Diamond Rio and Ricochet. This is the kind of CD that you can listen to front to back and never get tired of - EVERY TRACK IS EXCELLENT!!! I was left wanting more and I still cannot put my hands on the follow up ""something in the water"" but I have heard a few tracks and they are equally fantastic. To say this CD is Phenomenal does not do it justice. Shame on Nashville for not keeping these boys around."
4,On the Road Again!!,"This book starts out in Ancient Rome where Falco gets involved with the murder of another informer and the almost fatal injury of, all people, Anacrites - the chief of the spies who actually set him up to be killed in the last book. Faclo is commissioned to try to find out the killer and to stop some price-fixing plans that are being contemplated on olive oil - a very profitable product even in ancient Rome. His commission takes him to Roman Spain (or Corduba). The story is great fun and gives the reader a good understanding of ancient Spain and the Olive Oil industry. Falco brings his very pregnant cohort Helena with him on his journey. What would a Falco story be like without the beauteous Helena?"
4,Great,This is a great show and a great product. It was a birthday present for my sister and she loves it.
1,Just buy the japanese version,I thought it would be neat owning the american version however it is horrible compared to the voices and talking of the japanese one. Do not waste your money on this like I did just stick with the normal one...
5,My Favorite Book!!!,"This is the book I pick up whenever I need a quick pick-me-up. Whatever I'm feeling, I know Alice K. (not her real initial), will be going through something worse. The best book I've read that thoroughly captures the insecurities, delusions and humor of the 30something female mind!"
1,good deal but bad product,good deal but the book not contain nothing interesant or usefull to increse the mine(El libro no contiene nada interesante ni util para multiplicar el poder de la mente)
4,a good book about a fascinating movie,"Daughters of the Dust was a fascinating movie about the struggles of a female-headed, multigenerational family moving to the American mainland. It was made in fits and starts due to continual fundraising for the movie that Dash had to do. This book documents getting the movie made. It has a good section in which Dash and cultural critic bell hooks discuss the symbolisms in the film. Given that even Spike Lee has trouble raising money for his films, it is essential that incipient black filmmakers get advice on what they'r getting into. In that way, this book is an important first tool. Those majoring in film studies, feminist studies, or Afro-American studies will want to have this book."
4,Blood is thicker than Water,"The movie it self is very enjoyable, some great realistic scene's that will have you holding your breath. The storyline is about two brothers who are on two very different teams, one is a cop fighting to clear up the streets as the other is a night club owner who wants nothing to do with the solution to the problem.Its only when his brother gets hurt, he must than make the decision on which side to be on, his family or the people that could destroy all that he loves.Great movie, but I was disappointed at the ending, Hollywood cheese... it wasn't the worst ending but could had be brilliant."
2,melodrama that aims for mythic,"An intriguing set-up and some great action sequences, especially a car chase that is (rare for the movies) both believable and riveting, ultimately devolves into a slow story of brotherly reconciliation. The movie never pretends to be more than melodrama but then goes for broke by trying to make the characters and their story mythic instead of just keeping us rooted in a grimy crime drama. Writer-director James Gray tones it down and gets something far superior in the drama Two Lovers."
3,Not a grabber,It's not bad. It just feels like somethings missing. Good actors are burdened with a tired story. It's been told before. This could have waited for cable.
3,What the. . . where . . . huh!?!,"With such high production value, great acting and intense subject matter it just amazed me that no one sat down and tried to bang out a good story. Through the whole movie I just couldn't figure out where it was going. It kept jumping around and oddly focusing in on really strange ""setting the mood"" elements that didn't progress the story in any way or allow you to relate to the characters.I didn't hate it but I wouldn't recommend it either."
4,"Great Direction, So So picture transfer",I have no HD DVD player so I had to buy DVD.The picture is not that good knowing that it is HD telecine DVD.The movie. I saw it at the theater and again this movie makes my heart beat. The car chase scene. And actors are incredible. The ending seems a little bit loose.
3,"Just more of the same ole, same ole.....","This album is just more of what we already hear on radio. Cookie cutter. Baby face and Tracey are putting out product that just brings in marginal profit. There's no doubt that this girl (Beverly Crowder) is talented but this album misses because it lacks creativity. If she wants to last she should write her own stuff and maybe get the latest producers to work with her. Go towards the Kedar/Badu/L-Boogie flava instead of something that so mainstream. If this makes it to three single releases I'd be surprised. In inside circles, I hear she's difficult to work with so maybe that had something to do with the final product. Hopefully ""Beverly"" kept her day job......"
1,Worst Music Ever,"I don't know what the other reviewers have listened to, but it wasn't this CD. With all the great music out there Shape could have done MUCH better. All but two of the songs are horrible. The lyrics contain about 4 words and are repeated over and over, and they all sound the same. I power walk to music for an hour 5 days a week and usually love it. With great music the hour passes quickly. With this CD it goes on for ever!"
5,Perfect...for me.,"I purchased a single disk version of this cold. I fell in love after the first chord was struck. This album has everything I like about music. It's emotional, moody, melancholy, jamming. I've been listening to not much else for three weeks now. ( Yes! It has staying power, too.)If you liked snow patrol, cat power, seam, sunny day R.E., etc. buy this now! or at least check out the samples."
2,Flimsy binding.,"Great content. Full color throughout. very little fluff or ""padded"" content. Nice design and art direction. The binding, though, is really cheap. First time I looked through it, the glue cracked and pages began to fall out. I'm really careful about this type of thing and treat my books gently, so it wasn't due to abuse. Now, I'm afraid to open the book for fear of the whole thing disintegrating."
4,Worth to pay,"If you are pixel graphic lover, this is a must have pixel book !The book come with pixel music. There are 16 nice tracks in the cd, which remind me of famicom ""nintendo"" game console.The pixel art inside the book are nicely done. If u like eboy book and u feel not enough, this is the next pixel book for u."
2,Poetic Fast Food,"A game my friends and I often play is reminescing about our best meals-- no one has ever suddenly said, McDonalds last wednesday, the best big mac in the world! Beth Lisick's work is sadly like this. At first I was hungry for some humour so was highly impressed, but after the first reading nothing stayed with me. I saw her read and she was quite entertaining, a strong perfomer, but even then the poems still felt ... trivial. This book is, sadly, literary fast food."
1,Dangerous model,"I had this model for about 6 months until it started sparking internally one morning. I sent it back and received a replacement heater. They no longer carry this model. I was sent HZ-519 instead. I reported the HZ-614 to the Consumer Product Safety Commission and they investigated it. If you have the HZ-614, be careful and do not operate it unattended. The new model has worked fine so far (about 2 weeks)."
3,phone battery,the battery seems to work fine. i hate batteries but we seem to be slaves to them. so far this one is holding up fine.
3,What is it with these batteries?,"Just how is anybody supposed to make an intelligent purchase decision when buying replacement BT-446 batteries? On the one hand we have the white-wrapped, no-brand variety as cheap as $0.84 each. The charge on these does not last as long as the original equipment. Some don't hold a charge at all. On the other hand, we can spend up to $15 each for a brand name we have never heard of. I thought these ""Energizers"" would be an acceptable compromise at about the mid price-point. However, when they arrived, the batteries I received were not made by Energizer but were marked as Jensen. Can't really speak to how well Jensens compare with the original equipment but it does not appear we are going to get what we thought anyhow. If I'm taking a chance on the quality, I'll just stick with the white packaged ones going forward - at least they are cheaper."
3,NOT 100% SATISFIED!,"I had high hopes after being ripped off by faux impersonators. Talk time is not what I had hoped, but it does perform much better than the fakes represented as originals."
2,"excellent, shaving but there's a reason it's cheap","I had another Norelco shaver for the last 5 (or more) years. The difference in the shaves is striking. Both less pain when my stubble is a little long and closer.However, the reason this shaver is cheaper is that there is 1 battery inside it instead of 2. I know this because I took it in to be ""repaired"" because I only got 8 shaves to a charge. I talked (online) with Norelco and they said my shaver was broken. So, I looked up on the Norelco site a local authorized repair shop. I took it in and the guy opened it up. He said it was one of the ""cheap"" versions that has 1 instead of 2 batteries.My old shaver, over most of its life, gave me 25 or so shaves before needing to be recharged. That's quite a difference."
1,Norelco 6853XL razor,"This is a very low end Norelco razor that I would not recommend. It is not compatable with other Norelco accessories, such as cutting heads, chargers, etc."
1,mostly more of the same,"This latest in a series of books by Mr.Rosemond is a bit disappointing, especially for long-time readers of his other books and columns. I find the re-run anecdotes and columns tedious, the writing a tad sophomoric. The anecdote of his ""call of nature"" in an Alabama school restroom was just one example, and one I would have liked to have been spared.The topic of kids and violence is certainly one on the minds of most parents. And it is an easy read, and entertaining. I would have liked to have seen less personal anecdotes and more of the real research and studies that are out there; that he seemed to gloss over, in favor of levity.The book does contain useful information, especially towards the end. I had the thought that if he BEGAN again, with the ending of this book to begin a new one and fleshed it out a bit more, it would have more of an impact. This is a good basic book, but I would have liked it to have been a bit more scholarly."
4,UNDERSTANDING THE GAME,"I coach tennis for kids and teenagers for over 12 years. In order to plan classes not boring and profitable, I seek books that have pratical drills.Besides having this kind of drills, this book shows you HOW, WHY and WHEN you should apply them to a specific game situation. Using diferent patterns of play, from the defensive player to the aggressive one, this book matches drills with tactics, giving you a good perspective of THE GAME.I strongly recommend it.Mário SantosTennis CoachPORTUGAL"
5,Excellent book,"I have about 10 tennis books and this is the one that I grab every single training day to discuss the patterns and drills with my coach. If you really want to develop your game to a more efficient and consistent level, this book will help showing the patterns of play and the drills that cover them."
2,Not totally happy,"not happy the enurance capabilities, if you drop it acidentally, forget it. Hopefully the warranty will replace it. Othehwise I was happy with it's performance."
1,I Wish I Had Read These Reviews First,"I've had my Sportline 350 for just two weeks, and, confirming the experience of a number of other reviewers of this product, mine has stopped working too. This is particularly frustrating, because until now I was very happy with the product. I've learned my lesson -- I will be reading the reviews BEFORE I get my next pedometer. I'm guessing it would be a good bet that that next pedometer won't be a Sportline."
1,Zero steps,"Mine quit working after only two weeks and only registered ZERO steps.I tried to reset, and then got my computer/techno savy husband on the job.NOTHING. ZERO. ZIP. NADA.We have both e-mailed the company with NO response.that is ZERO, ZIP, NADA. I can understand we might have gotten a lemon.We tried to phone the company and were met with a voice-mail nightmare.The fact that the company hasn't replied is very disappointing.***Final update: The replacement worked for one week. Now only half of thedigital numbers show up. I can get them to appear by pressing very hardin the upper right hand corner. Final report... don't bother!"
3,"never used as a breastfeeding pillow, but its nice when reading or using as a pillow for baby","i never used it for its intention because i believe it lacks in those departmnets, however, i used to put the baby in the u area and let him lay with me to watch movies etc. it elevated him wonderfully and did the same during reading. I like all the covers that you can get, however, they are rather pricey."
5,great for lovely wives,"When we first brought our precious baby boy home, I bought this nursing pillow as a gift for my wife and she sure got good use out of it. It made breastfeeding/ bottlefeeding comfortable and it reduced back strain for her. I also used it when I bottle feed my boys and it worked very well too."
5,Awesome!,"I have bought Boppy's and several slipcovers for friends, and they all LOVE it. Quality is good, easy to take off and wash. Patterns are adorable, and you can find more variety here on Amazon than many stores. When I have a baby of my own, this will be at the top of my registry list!"
5,Love this boppy!,Perfect for our twin granddaughters. Wish we had this when my kids were little! A must have for new Moms!!!!
1,"Not a good nursing pillow; get ""My Brest Friend"" instead.","I completely agree with the review posted by the user: ""Jacob's Momma."" The Boppy is NOT the ideal pillow for nursing, but it is good for letting my baby lie on to rest/sleep and as a support pillow for burping my baby in a sitting position. For a good nursing pillow, get ""My Brest Friend."" I got the Boppy first, and it is too soft to support my baby for nursing. It also constantly slips away from me, and my baby tends to slip between me and the Boppy. For these reasons, my back felt strained when I used the Boppy for nursing. Then, I bought ""My Brest Friend"" and it worked great -- all the problems that I just mentioned were solved -- it's firm and supportive, and it also ""locks"" around my waist so it won't slip. Check out the reviews for ""My Brest Friend"" before buying the Boppy as a nursing pillow. Final FYI: I've seen the Boppy sold at Ross for $19.99 and that includes a fleece cover, so keep an eye out for it if you want a bargain."
1,Total Disappointment,"I registered for this thinking I'd use it for nursing. Well, I've been nursing for almost a month now, and I've found this pillow to be a bigger nuisance than helper. Here's why:1. The way it's shaped allows the baby to slip down towards your belly button. Rather than being flat towards your stomach, it angles downwards, allowing the baby no support. I end up holding her anyway.2. It doesn't stay on! No matter where I'm sitting: couch, rocker, chair, etc., it falls off! How annoying.3. I'm tall. I have to slouch over.4. Because of problem #1, I use a blanket to stuff in between the pillow and my belly. What a complete waste!It really should be shaped the like the pillows used in hospitals: flat the whole way. Totally a better design."
1,Will hinder your breastfeeding,"Horrible waste of money. The pillow slides all over the place, away from me, away from the baby, and onto the floor. The only practical use we found for it was for my husband to prop his head up while bottle feeding. It does not fit around the waist or support the weight of a baby. Get another pillow."
4,Pretty good item...,"The pillow was pretty good for breast feeding, especially if you aren't looking to spend a lot of money. There are better breast feeding pillows, but they cost quite a bit. However, this pillow has been great for my daughter to lie in. She loves it! I work from home, so I would lay this pillow beside me and lay her in it and she was perfectly content. When she first began to sit up we used this pillow to cushion her and now she is 7 months old and will lay in it while she watches her Baby Einstein DVD's. It was worth every penny!"
4,Great place to visit...,"If you want to have one Knack collection and don't want to spend a lot, this is a very good retrospective. Of course, ""My Sharona"" and ""Good Girls Don't"" are here, along with a few neglected classics (""You're Number or Your Name"") and some harder to find songs such as the Springsteen penned ""Don't Look Back"". If you want just one album by this band, then it really should be ""Get the Knack"", but this is the best of the three or four career retrospectives."
4,Fan since childhood,"I have always loved Kenny Rogers, even as I progressed onto other artists from Timbaland to Nsync over the years. But, I have always loved going back to listening his music. His movies are something that you have to like if you like Westerns. However, Coward of the County is a story exactly like the song. If you like the song by him..you will like the movie."
4,Wonderful,"It was hard to find a workable player for the e200 series, and after some research, this was my choice. And I would like to say I made a very good choice. My player fits snugly, the stacking speakers make for space, and the sound quality is excellent: the music fills the whole master bedroom plus the hallway, bathroom and open loft area from where it sits by my bed. I personally didn't need to update my firmware, my e280 charged and played without having to. However I would like to say that if a firmware update is needed (as I have seen in other reviews a misconception of this not being stated) that in the dock plastic wrapping, there is a notice that you may need to update the firmware and it also instructs you where to go for it.Overall, I'm very pleased with this purchase and would readily recommend it to anyone who is looking for a dock/speaker combo for the e200 series in the Sansa line. I wasn't disappointed a bit."
1,Terrible shaving cream,"Received a free sample of this while at Bath & Body Works with my wife. I tried shaving with it, and wound up bleeding in a dozen places. On top of that, it didn't give a close shave. Finally, it offered no moisturizing, so it left my face dry and uncomfortable.Bath & Body Works is apparently trying to expand their customer base with men's products, but this stuff just doesn't cut it."
5,SouthernBelle,"This book along with the Elizabeth Goodweather series from Vicki Lane is a must read. The details of the area of the North Carolina mountains makes one want to move to the area. The story and the people pulls you into their lives and makes you want to know each one (except maybe the bad ones). If you want a real mystery with history, wonderful characters as well as a good read then read this book along with the other four books that make this a series. You will not be disappointed!"
5,Thoroughly enjoyable,"Cozy mystery readers should not be put off by the title; this is not a gory story, but rather an engaging trip deep into Appalachia. Vicki Lane has created a genuinely likeable, down-to-earth protaganist, and a host of interesting suspects in this yarn. I'm ready for her next one."
3,"All in all, I liked it!","Voices was a good book, it was just like an episode. The main characters are Garabaldi, Talia and Bester."
2,"Are these the same characters that I know from ""Babylon 5""?","My friend recently got me hooked on the show, and I've watched the repeats of the first four seasons. I liked the show enough to pick this book up. I was very disappointed, because I found the characters in the book acting very differently from the way they do on the show. I can only hope the other books in the series treat the characters of Mr. Straczynski better."
2,did not down load all the songs showed on the right,showed 50 songs to the right and only down loaded the worse 27 or so songs? best 10 songs left off
1,Kind of similar to the original,"If you are looking for a set of 60's recordings that almost sound like the original artist and are presented with arrangements that are kind of like the originals for a pretty cheap price, then this album is for you."
2,not the greatest oldies mp3,I was disappointed with the artist performing the songs. Some songs are wonderful while others leave alot to be desired.
4,these guys rock!,I make it a point to go see this band a couple of times every year. They are so much fun! You just can't keep still!
3,Third Temple?!,The book claims that the Western Wall was part of the THIRD temple. It says that the temple was destroyed twice and rebuilt twice when it was only rebuilt once. Also it mentions Jerusalem and not just its role in Judaism but other religions such as Islam. Not much detail is given about other Jewish Holy Places only Masada and Yad Vashem. Some details about Judaism are given and it has nice pictures.
1,THIS RAZOR SUCKS!,It gave me a razor burn sooooooooooooooo bad my girlfriend asked if Satan grabbed my face!
1,Died after 6 months,Shaver started having a problem with the indicator lights staying on for an extended period of time and running the battery down. After several days the battery would no longer change. Would not recommend purchasing this model.
5,The Price of Knowledge,"This book was a great read. The ""picture taking man,"" as Parks was often called, crafted a finely layered novel about coming of age in the years prior to integration and the civil rights movement. The book is sad, funny, and painfully true. It is a must for anyone who wants to understand the extent to which racism dehumanizes and destroys; and for anyone who wants to understand the meaning of courage and the unbreakable will of the human spirit."
2,Don't let the title fool you !,"I got this thinking it was a helpful ""clinical"" reference book i could carry around in my lab coat. However, this book is far from clinically helpful. It's more of a generalized information book on medicine, with vague descriptions on the treatment options available. Not enough detail specific information in this book."
5,"Light, Strong, Easy","These envelopes are great. The adhesive is very strong, the poly is very durable. The one review below about the stickers coming off.... put the label on BEFORE you open/poof up the envelope. I have had no issues with my 4x6 FedEx thermal labels with these."
2,Avoid Americopy Vendor,"These things were horrible from this vendor. I know its impossible to know on a blind shot. but dude, these bags were like vacuum sealed together. I had to peel open each envelope. Huge paid in the neck. You should be able to just open it and insert whatever you put in.It was so annoying, I would literally get the blow gun on my air compressor and blow air into about 20 or so at a time just to prep them for use."
3,ugly but kind of interesting,"This thing could look so much better-I find the ""stones""/thermotropic liquid crystals on mood rings to be quite lovely-unfortunately the band is usually hideous and toxic. This is not supposed to be a mood ring, but I'm not sure how different it really is. If it had a better design I might have more positive feelings toward it. I don't know if it's accurate or not-I'm often surprised by the reading I get, for instance; I will be in complete agony while the ring tells me I'm having the time of my life."
2,Temp Ring,"Product was OK, but doesn't do what I hoped it would. Too hard to read and to monitor finger temperature on a continuous basis."
3,Too many styles,"I ordered this CD after having heard several cuts from ""Fisherman's Blues,"" such as ""Sweet Thing,"" ""A Bang on the Ear,"" and the title track. I knew that the emsemble evolved through different styles in these ten years, but boy howdy, I didn't know just how much it evolved. The first several tracks are brash college-band tunes, albeit with Scott's more mature touches. I only enjoyed the more Celtic and folk flavored later tracks, and I therefore find myself skipping through the CD quite a bit. That being said, if you dig the early INXS sound, the earlier efforts are superb. The CD is absolutely an accurate representation of the group's music from '81 to '91, it just wasn't quite what I had hoped. The Waterboys just went through too many phases growing up. Caveat Emptor."
2,Mildly entertaining,"This was a very predictable and easy read. Originally published on the internet, it is easy to see why it was difficult to find a publisher to print hard copies of this book. As quick and easy as it was to read, it seems like it was just as quick and easy to write. It doesn't seem like much time or effort went into plot or character development at all. Its like the authors found the formula on how to write a cheesy romance novel and followed it with no deviations."
1,short of expectations,This album fails to define CB style. In most of his albums you can play from 1-10 w/o skipping. His albums consist of songs that set a tempo and mood. The very best of CB is not the very best. I listen TO CB everyday and this is one album that I never listen to. Poor composition and arragement of songs. I would skip it.
2,Disappointing,"The Botti trumpet is excellent, however it has to fight with monotonous, uninspired, drum work and assorted background that is overwhelming the clear, beautiful notes of Botti. The vocals are ghastly. The crew on this CD needs to listen to some Henry Mancini arrangements; they could learn something about instrumentation."
4,study,this is a wonderful look back into the colors and styles of the past. A must read for anyone doing restoration.
4,Strange facts!!,"I have always been curious to know about different universes, past life and I keep wondering how it would actually be if a person from earth goes and takes his next birth in some other universe. This curiosity led me to us this book. Good work by Dolores Cannon. By past life regression of her subjects Dolores shows how life on other planets will be and we actually may be an alien in our past life. She records the sessions which creates a memory of past life. The boo creates an expansion in mind about the mysteries existing in universe. Quiet fascinating book."
2,Not as expected,"I was really disappointed in this pattern. Really drab and boring in my opinion, and it has a funny sage green/purple cast to it. Was supposed to be a subtle gray/silver. Price is great, but I wasn't impressed by this pattern. On the positive side, Amazon service was fantastic. Fast delivery and super easy to return."
1,I must admit,"I must admit: if you're a fan of cheesy songs of the worst glam can offer you, this is the right album."
4,What a Hits cd should be...,"This is one of the better Greatest Hits cds. It has all the singles, a few non-single album tracks and a couple unreleased songs (well they were unreleased at the time it came out). Of course there's only so much room on a cd so there's always gonna be something that someone likes being left off. I would've liked to see their cover of ""Rock n Roll All Nite"" and maybe ""Let It Play"" on here, and the post-CC years are only briefly touched, but overall it's a good representation of Poison. Every song is good and most should be familiar to new or casual fans."
1,Poor copy of Hanoi Rocks!!,"I remember the first time I saw Poison on TV. I went like ""Oh my God. This is the worst version of Hanoi Rocks ever!"". Fortunately there my TV was mute. After I heard Poison I hated those impostors even more. A bunch of apes with lipstick. Brett Michaels can't sing, C.C. DeVille is the worst guitarist ever and other two aren't better of those two clowns either. Luckily in the 80's we had Guns N' Roses and Faster Pussycat. They respected the memory of Hanoi Rocks (not just stole the image)."
4,Pretty darn good,"I'm usually more into more modern music, but for some reason I really like this band. Their songs are very infectious and fun to listen to, its a shame all that talentless grunge crap had to destroy pop-metal."
5,Recommend for teachers,I teach a small group of developmentally delayed high school students and this book provides great activities. I modify when needed. I like to emphasize and use new vocabulary. This book provides pre-made lesson plans. I referred to CASAS for associated standards. Good luck!
4,Funny soap opera,"Aunt Julia and the Script Writer is a deranged masterpiece, a comic coming of age story about young Mario, who has fallen in love with his sexy aunt. Interleaved with this story are the tales of a Bolivian script writer, who has enthralled Lima with his radio soap operas. The book grows progressively more absurd and surreal, as the comic inventions of the script writer lead to real-world chaos. It's a soap opera in magic realism, as if Gabriel Garcia Marquez decided to do something completely different. It's a book that is close to being autobiographical, as Vargas Llosa mined his own soap opera of his life for the material of this funny romp.It's awesome that the script writer has so much power in the book. And it's filled with slurs against the Argentines, giving you a flavor of deadly rivalries in South America."
3,Its about time!,"Good book.PocketC is a fantastic platform for beginners, because A) it is easy to get into and B) it has very few bug in it. In fact I have never had a PocketC program crash on me yet, not even when my own code causes runtime errors, it always handles them.Those programmers that complain that PocketC is not real C have not done enough research into this field. All the ""Real C"" compilers that I have seen so far are extremely unstable and finikity. They crash at the slightest provocation. PocketC is the most stable language I have seen for the Palm. And I reckon this is how it will stay for a fair while yet."
2,Almost Misleading,"I eagerly purchased this book as soon as it became available thinking it would benefit me in programming PalmOS applications in C.Wrong, wrong, wrong. If you are considering purchasing this book, make sure you are aware of the platform you need."
2,Marketing tool for PocketC,"This book does not make clear on its cover that it teaches you to write applets, *not* standard Palm applications.What is far worse, is that it claims it includes all the tools necessary to use the book. However, the desktop compiler refuses to work on any of the source after chapter 1 (it only supports code up to 768 characters). In order to complete the examples in the book, you must either purchase the full version (at least [more money]) of PDE, or write and compile everything on your palm top.Many other reviewers of this product apperently have been programming for a long time, and have purchased PDE already. They fail to note that the true cost of this book is [a little more] (after purchasing the full version of PDE).The book appears to be good, but this is dishonest marketing."
1,Low grade case with no protection,"I have been looking for a case like this for a while and was disappointed with the Shoreline product. The idea of keeping the laptop inside the case makes a lot of sense. However, Shoreline doesn't meet the standard that has been set in the market. After buying this case and disliking it, a friend told me about a company called TEKSTYL. Apparently they are the innovators and originals behind the ""stay-on"" laptop products. I spent a little more money for a MUCH better case. Trust me, all though not that well known, TEKSTYL cases are the best! Tekstyl.com"
3,Know what your doing!,"I got this as a birthday present and everything came package alright but when i opened the soil it seemed very moss-like, not the dirt im used to. I got it to grow to about 3 inch then it died...I dunno if i did somthing wrong bu make sure when you get it you know how to grow it!"
5,A Cult above the rest.,"I saw this film when it first came out and I see it now as it approaches its 50th birthday. It was fun then and it still is today. Mr. Castle, too often categorized as a low budget Hitchcock, was anything but that. He directed many major film stars, was the producer of Rosemary'y Baby, and for over a decade treated filmgoers to a gimmicky bunch of horror films that gave us the creeps but never nightmares.""Homicidal"" has a FRIGHT BREAK plus a unique kick that fooled me completely.If yuo can't find it to rent it's worth the price to buy it for a cool campy chill."
4,just what i wanted,this light is just what i needed for my work its compact and bright the only downside is it gets a little hot but im very happy with it
3,The Weakest of the Series,"The folks at the Harvard Negotiation Project have produced a lot of books. I have found this volume the least satisfying of their works.Perhaps this is because _Getting to Yes_ and _Getting Past No_ are so amazingly good that the level of analysis simply wasn't sustainable for a third book. Or perhaps it's I personally tend to think by analogy and had already started applying the concepts in the first two books to non-business settings. In any event, I found the concepts obvious and the discussions banal.The quality of the later books seems to return to the same high level as GTY and GPN. For example, _Difficult Conversations_, though not strictly a book ""about negotiation,"" is very fine, although not as easy a read as the other two.Bottom line? Useful if you haven't figured out on your own how to apply the concepts of principled negotiation to your personal life. Otherwise, skip it."
4,Heather McMillan,"I run a virtual assistant coaching and training business, and I have a been a virtual assistant since 1996. Ever since I read this book, I began to recommend this book to my clients of my VA coaching/training business, because it gives a great uncomplicated outline of the steps you need to take to start up your virtual assistant business. I doesn't glamorize the VA industry or make promises of getting rich quick. The common sense and informational approach really worked well. While I don't feel the information in this book is comprehensive of all aspects of starting a VA business, it is a great and solid outline to build."
4,Something not really mentioned,I didn't give it 5 starts cause I really like pop music and was expecting a lot of pop channels. But there is only like 2 or 3 at most.But what I did want to say is I live in Los Angeles and everyone has been telling me that the FM modulator sucks. But with the system I had in my car I'd have to special order the direct connect so I ordered the Roady 2 instead and was just going to try out the FM modulator before trying a direct connect. I have to say the FM modulator works great. Everyone was telling me you're going to hear a lot of static and other channels coming through etc. Found a good channel and my roady 2 comes in clearly.I figured it was worth a shot and if it didn't work I could just return it or hard wire it. So I'm pretty happy with it.
2,Spider's nest of wires!,"I have had the Roady 2 for 6 months and enjoy the XM service very much. Great programs, no signal fade, very enjoyable. The Roady 2, however, is a pain in the butt. Be prepared to have wires running everywhere in a tangled mess. In addition, the screen is too small for using while driving. I suggest you use the tape adapter (another wire! ) because there is always a local station interfering with the Roady's broadcast. I received the free second unit from XM. It's still sitting on the shelf unopened. I suggest you spend the money for an in-dash unit."
4,I like it,"I got the Delphi receiver maybe 2 years ago. It's great for people who want to try satallite radio, but aren't great in the electronics department. Its simple to use and I like how you can change the colors of the backlight. The only time I get bad reception is if I'm in the back woods somewhere, but that is rare. The down side to this receiver is that the black faceplate came off, which is probably why they gave you two extras. The vent clip gets worn out over time and doesn't stay on the air vent half the time. And unless you get the unit professionally installed, there is an crap load of wires to stash in your glove box. I would recommend this unit to others, the only thing I would do differnt is get it installed. It's a great starter unit. It does the job, which is play satalite music."
4,Excellent Receiver!!,"What can I say? This is a great xm receiver. Simple, Basic, pretty straightforward and can hold 30 presets. The fm modulator is strong before they added that sureconnect that is weaker. I have had this for 5 years w/o any problems and works great, seems well built. Try to find on Ebay or Amazon if you can."
