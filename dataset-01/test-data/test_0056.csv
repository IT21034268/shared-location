2,Not his best effort,"Fortunately this is not the first book from Bill Bryson I ever read or I would have given up. It is very insulting to Americans, especially small town people. Although his humor is at times funny it's also offensive (to me anyway). Even though he was born American, he was living in the UK and flew over to write this book. He portrays the heart of our nation as a bunch of idiots basically. Skip this one and get ""In a Sunburned Country"" instead."
5,This is one of the funniest travel books ever!,"It's not supposed to be a serious travel book, people! Maybe it's because I have lived in many of the places Bryson describes in this book, but I recognize all these types of people he meets along the way and he is dead-on in his descriptions. This book made me a Bryson fan forever, although some of his other book never quite hit this level of hilarity (with the exception of A Walk in the Woods). I used to read this on the train to work, and I had to clamp a hand over my mouth to keep from laughing aloud! This is one of my alltime favorite books! Just TRY it!"
5,Best USA Travelogue Ever.,"Unless you're one of those truely pathetic types who cannot stomach ANY criticism of America and Americans, you'll love 'The Lost Continent'. It is probably Bill Bryson's finest work, which is really saying something, since he is one of the finest writers around today.And fair's fair: We thoroughly enjoyed reading Bryson's hysterically ascerbic and witty comments about Europe, Europeans and other people and places, so we ought to love it when he gives us the very same treatment, and the fact is he does it so much better than anybody else!*** SPOILER ALERT ***But here's a tip for you sad types who would call French Fries ""Freedom Fries"": At the end of 'The Lost Continent', in the last few pages -- the ones you didn't see because you had a tantrum and threw the book down after only making it to around page 7 -- Bryson recants, and expresses his undying admiration and love for America and Americans."
2,sardonic - derisively mocking or disdainfully humorous,"Bryson's account proves to me that education leaves a lot to be desired. Some quotes...""the Sunday New York Times - and it's well worth every trembling leaf. So what if our grandchildren have no oxygen to breathe? F**ck 'em"". ""The average Southerner has the speech patterns of someone slipping in and out of consciousness"". ""I was alone with a small bag of pathetic treats in the most boring town in America"". I think the most boring part of the trip was Bryson himself. Although his writing shows glimpses of real humor, and real wit, most of his attempted humor is at the expense of real people. People who wisely left this pompous fool alone. I'm glad I picked up the hardcover version of this book at a garage sale for 50 cents. Then again, maybe I overpaid."
1,Don't Waste Time or Money on This Drivel,"I picked this up because it looked like a fun read of a time gone by in Middle America. I expected a lively rolicking tale.I got into the first chaper, flipped thru, read random paragraphs and the book is now in my Goodwill pile.This was my first Bill Bryson book. A friend was raving about A Walk in the Woods and Bryson's writing. I stopped her and said I wasn't going to waste my money. I cited my experience with this book. ""Oh. Ah. Yeah."" She said. ""Yeah. I wouldn't've read anything else by Bryson if that were my first book of his either.""That pretty much sums it up. The author comes across as a petty, mean-spirited, prejudiced SOB with a crude sense of humour. I really wish I could get my money back."
3,*sigh* Coulda been good.,"Her voice is astonishing, it is beautiful and haunting. I love her voice a lot. Unfortuneately I think this was the only thing I truly liked about this cd. When I spun it the first time, I was happy it sounded nice and everything was good... but as I listened I realized that this CD was... all the same. All of the tracks sound the same... They all have the same theme the guitar sounds the same... it's boring. Their sound is very nu-metal which is annoying, because nu-metal sucks... in fact their noise reminds me of Linkin Park. I have a feeling the next cd is gonna sound exactly the same as this one... I liked it originally...but I realize now it was all her voice and the whole mall-goth poser hot-topic theme is just not my idea of good music. I give them three... but that's all her voice... if you want better stuff of a similar style, check out Lacuna Coil."
4,A nice change,"The lead singers voice is incredible. Her trained vocals and the music make for a different, but great rock sound. Most of the songs have the same kind of rhythm and melody, however, which makes the album have a repetitive quality."
3,Enjoyable and Engaging - But a bit Repetitive,"I must say to begin with that I've very much enjoyed listening to this CD - and these days, that is really saying something. Evanescence has an original sound, not perhaps instrumentally but definitely vocally. My only problem is that they don't push the envelope further. They seemed to find a sound that they liked, then rammed all of their melodies through it. I tire of the same guitar sound in almost every song. There are a few respites from this, but they are short lived at best.Do I regret buying the CD? No - absolutely not. This is an engaging brand of pop metal fused with a vaguely (sometimes overtly) Christian viewpoint."
3,probably takes a while to get into,"before i start this review,im going to go ahead and tell you that i have not listened to the whole album. ive only listened to teh first 5 songs. so, now comes teh review. apparently this is one of those albums that takes a very patient soul to get into. i am not a patient soul. i found the first five songs (with teh exception of going under, and my immortal) to be very boring and slow paced. i know ya'll probably think that im drunk or something saying that ""bring me to life"" is slow paced, but onmce you hear it for the 1,000,000th time, it sorta loses its edge. i might be totally wrong about the labum, so if it will make you guys happy, ill listen to the album and then do another review! well, that all!~*Meredith*~"
4,This album took me by suprise...,"I bought this album for the two more popular songs - My Immortal and Bring Me TO Life. I will preface by saying that I am not a huge Rock fan - Def Leppard and Creed is about my limit usually.I'll be succinct: Amy has a set of pipes that put her in a select group. The album is a reflection of her voice, and without a doubt, she makes Evanescence what it is. She could become the lead singer of Creed, BNL or even No Doubt.The only thing that this album does not do adequately is show her full range. This is dissapointing, but I think that it leaves room for another album.I like almost all of the songs on this album. I grew up in the eighties, so I was pleasantly suprised at this.Buy the album. I'd be cautious at their next offering, since they are a new band, but this is the real deal."
3,Better than you might think,"Despite all the hype built around Evanescence and their album ""Fallen"", this band is much better than one might think. Their contributions on the Daredevil soundtrack were some of the only listenable material for me, and while their full length debut may not be perfect, it is surprisingly good. Vocalist Amy Lee has a voice that puts a number of other female vocalists to shame, and the only real flaw of the band as a whole is that they have an almost too nu-metal sound. Standout tracks include ""Going Under"", ""Haunted"", ""My Tourniquet"", and ""My Last Breath"", while the hit single ""Bring Me to Life"" can grow unlistenable after repeated listenings. I cannot understand either why so many people compare Evanescence to Linkin Park. This band has more talent in their nosehairs than Linkin Park has as a whole combined unit. All in all, ""Fallen"" may be a bit overrated, but it is much better than I thought it would be; it's just too bad that Evanescence is stuck on Wind-Up records."
1,Lacuna Coil minus a spark,"This band is nothing more then a dumbed down linkin park version of Lacuna Coil, picks lacuna's album comalies and see what real goth rock is."
2,C'mon ! You've heard it before !,"This is Linkin Park wearing a skirt ! It's unbelievable how people describe this record as coming from outer space, and bringing something new to the music scene ! How many groups of so-called ""Nu Metal"" you can quickly remember ? Just because Evanescence has a girl with the mic doesn't make it any better !Try CURVE instead !"
3,not as good as I hoped,"Much like everyone else, I was snagged by the singers voice, entranced I bought the cd. With high hopes I popped it in the cd player, and sat back to enjoy. Within the first 5 tracks I was so annoyed by her playing with her voice and not knowing what sits best with it. Overall, not a bad cd, but improvements are needed."
2,"Nothing new, just for fans of the band i guess","All the hype about this album convinced my girlfriend to force me to buy her this album. I was hesitant at first after hearing the song from DareDevil. Anyway, i bought it for her. We listened to it in my car, and before the 3rd song was over i noticed she was getting bored. So i decided to pop in Lacuna Coil's Comalies and she woke up. Now this CD is sitting somewhere in my car (together with my running shoes) and she has all my Lacuna Coil and Nightwish CDs... Sure taught her a lesson about relying in reviews too much. This CDs not that bad, its just not worth it unless you're really a fan of the band i think."
1,>>>Linkin Park meets Tori Amos meets mascara<<<,"This band really is not very good. The only slightly good thing is Amy Lee's voice, but if you want an actually talented female vocalist in a metal band, check out The Gathering, Leaves Eyes or Ayreon's ""The Human Equation""(there's 3 on that album). If all this was was Amy Lee though it would probably get 3 stars, the rest of the band are pitiful. The drums are boring and untalented, the guitars are basically the overdistorted power chords you get in any numetal band.Don't even get me started on the male singer's voice, lets just say he should close his mouth and never open it again. This album does have it's moments, but The Gathering and/or Leaves Eyes are miles ahead of this bland numetal (as much as you hate to admit it, they are basically Korn with a female singer)."
2,There has to be more,"This is the group that is getting an obscene amount of buzz, for what appears to me to be no apparent reason. True, Amy Lee has a voice on her, but so do many. The sterility of the music surrounding her is really surprising. The overproduction and lackluster guitar work is in perfect evidence. It's the tired traditional quiet verse-loud chorus given no new spin except for that a female is blasting her lungs out. Metal shouldn't sound like it has no passion, to put it bluntly, it shouldn't sound ready-made for radio, which sadly this does, and not in a good way. Whatever, I'm done."
5,Amazing,"I Love this CD! Evanescence is so band of the year (in my opinion) Goth or not Evanescence will always be one of my fav. bands! Amy Lee has one of the best voices I have ever heard, This CD has an awesome sound and well-written lyrics.Evanescence Rocks Now and Forever"
4,good album,"I would definitaley recommend this cd to everyone. The music is good and the tune is just so..god I kan't think of a word. Well, just to let you know, you have gotta buy it if you are into gothic style music, even if you aren't, buy it anyway. You gotta give it a shot before you hate, right?"
4,Incredible album,"This is the band I've been waiting for. Whatever happened to good rock? Evanescence will answer that question for you. The songs are full of emotion and the dark, moody and beautiful voice of Amy brings them home. She's definately my new favorite vocalist and this disk has not left my CD player since I got it.Don't go by the single, although I thought it a decent song the rest of the tracks have something special that the single doesn't."
3,Pretty Good,"I just recently started listening to rock and metal so i don't know what is ""real"" metal and what is ""fake"". I think Fallen is a cd that will sound wonderful to people like me who don't know anything about rock. But if you're someone who is a big fan of goth rock and metal than you would probably not like Fallen because I believe it was made to be easy on the ears to people like me."
3,refreshing and different in a derivative kind of way,"evanescence bring together equal parts hard rock and gothic music. there is a darkness to the music and especially the lyrics which are mostly dark but still retain some kind of faith(more like spirituality) to let the light shine at the end of the dark tunnel.its hard to describe but id say tori amos meets linkin park with a goth edge, or the cranberries meets queen of the damned sounddtrack. the singer, amy lee, has a beaufiful voice. it is both haunting and pretty. there are some killer riffs and some beautiful chord progressions here. i like the eerie feel this album gives off.there is not much new here but is still powerful, chilling and quite amazing in its execution. the music is melodic and has a vibe all its own. it is a good start for this band from little rock arkansas and i do recommend it"
2,No variation,"I must say that I was hoping for more when I bought this cd. The whole album sounds more or less exactly like the song ""Bring me to life"" and in the long run it all becomes rather boring. Personally, I'd prefer a more melodic approach. In small doses, Evanescence is alright but the album feels like one long song instead of 11 separate tunes, much because of the way Amy Lee is structuring the vocal parts. And I'm sure this album will be regarded as very time typical in a couple of years. To me, Evanescence sounds like a nicer Skunk Anansie with a touch of Audioslave as well as The Calling. For depressed goth rockers wearing black this album might be a treat. Ten bucks says this band will be forgotten after the second album."
1,Absolutly Horrendous!!!,This has to be without a doubt one of the worst bands i have ever heard.Her voice is terrible plus she just drones on and on until you become clinically depressed. And then that guy comes in and starts rapping and it sounds like linkin park. Every single song sounds exactly the same. The lyrics are horrible too. Gore metal lyrics have more variation than hers. Why does she sound so depressed all the time. What does she have to be depressed about? Nothing. The music is just as bad as the lyrics and vocals. The guitars are dreadfull. They are tuned way down so that they have no definition. If you have any self respect do not by this abomination.
2,"Yes, they have fallen","Evanescence has decided to no longer define themselves as a Christian band. I have no problem with secular bands. Evanescence, however, waited until after the peak of sales for their popular cd ""Fallen"" to make the announcement. They've taken advantage of the people who were looking to support an area of music that is often overlooked. I support them in changing their label from Christian to secular... at least they will not be seen as hypocrites... but it seems manipulative of them to have chosen the timing as they have so that they could maximize profits. This cd is very appropriately titled ""Fallen"".(If you are looking for a nice, clean cd done by secular artists, this it great! The songs are a bit repetetive though. Many of them sound sort of like the same song over and over, just with different words.)"
5,Haunting!,"Haunting and energetic songs full of passion, love, and loss. Dark and meaningful lyrics that really make you think. This is a hauntingly beautiful and solid album!"
4,Fallen from rock heaven...,"Let me introduce you to Evanescence. A band out of Little Rock, coming from an unknown label, and getting its big break on a movie soundtrack. Who would have thought this band could go 5x platinum and have 10 million records sold worldwide.Well... Fallen is the result. The album that got them where they are.Between the strong guitars of Ben Moody and the chilling vocals of Amy Lee, this album is a stand out.Although the songs to tend to sound the same the first few times you listen to them, each song is unique. ""Imaginary"", ""Taking Over Me"", ""Whisper"", and ""Everybody's Fool"" have to be extreme highlights.I love every song on this album and I love the band. So I guess I have a kind of bias opinion. But I do recommend you listen to this album. You will probably enjoy something on it."
3,Great First Try For Evanescence!,"Some people think that this album is overrated. NOT ME, although they have been a tad overplayed on the radio. I am not some hard core fan of Evanescence nor Miss Amy (although they have received MUCH PUBLICITY). I enjoyed the whole album, especially ""My Immortal"" & ""Tourniquet"". The members of Evanescence are up for several Grammys & while I don't necessarily think that Evanescence is high caliber, I certainly wouldn't begrudge them a ""Best New Artist"" grammy over some of the other nominees that are less deserving... If you like Tori Amos, The Cranberries, Poe or Fiona Apple, you WILL enjoy this album."
4,Great!,"This is a great CD. If i could grade it buy a percent i would give it a 90-94. Amy has such a lovely voice and i LOVE singing-along to this CD. All of the songs are really good. I always sing-along to My Immortal,Haunted,Tourniquet,Imaginary,Hello,My last breath and Whisper. The only thing is that Evanescence sounds a little too much like Linkin Park/Staind. But still, Evanescence is one of my favorite bands and you should go buy this CD"
5,This Album is definately not Going Under!,"I admit, I for sometime forgot the song Bring Me To Life, since I hardly listen to the radio, however, I got the Daredevil DVD, and out of the 3 music videos on it, it is the only one I enjoy, so I got into the song again. Since I enjoy the song, I purchesed the Evanescence CD (Fallen) and I do not regret this purches at all. The whole album kicks ass. There is not a bad song on the album, it is worth spending the money to purches it."
4,definatley evanescence,"bring me to live is overplayed on the radio just a little bit. i loved it when it first came out, but now i cannot stand it. love the slow songs on this album. my immortal is just a beautifully crafted peice of math. i love the guitar riff in ""tourniquet"" and ends with one of my favorite songs. i don't usually like girls trying to be all hard core, but this is just outstanding slash awesome. good stuff if i do say so myself. the only setback of the album is ""haunted,"" which is definatley haunting if that's what you're looking for. it doesn't do anything for me, however. get some jollies by checking out this album. good day."
3,They've had their 15 minutes of fame...,"...and now they're overrated.Don't get me wrong, Amy Lee's voice is truly beautiful. It's just that they've gone way too mainstream (excuse me if that made no sense).After listening the C.D., you realise that most of the songs start to sound alike. You realise that only some of the songs truly stand out. After listening to the C.D. multiple times, you then realise that the material has gotten old. You start thinking that Amy Lee could really be writing about some different topics.It's also sad that Ben Moody, Amy Lee's original counterpart -- the guy who she started Evanescence is, has left the band. Who could blame him? Amy was getting all the attention, and he, the counterpart of the band, wasn't.Songs like ""Bring Me To Life"" and ""My Immortal"" will be here for some time, and yes, they're great songs, but there's always room for new material."
3,I thought that they were at least some what christian???,I only liked a few songs on here. I think that they are VERY VERY disturbing. They are even some what creepy. Amy Lee's amazing voice doesn't even do the album justice. I thought that they were supposed to be at least some what christian and from what i can see there is only one song that is anything like christian at all. I personally will not be buying there second release.
3,"Good, but not great........","i would suggest borrowing this CD from a friend or downloading a few tracks before you buy it. i dont think its worth paying more then 12 bucks for either, so get it used or from one of the cheap sites if you can. the reason i say this is that although there are some excellent songs on this cd, the album as a whole gets a little reptive and boaring. there really isnt a whole lot of varitey on this CD to keep things interesting. it doesnt have a whole lot of replay value either. youd be better off buying this cheap and then using the songs you like as part of a mix for an MP3 player or CD-R. i dont mean to knock this band, i think they def have some talent. but i was certianly dissapointed with this album as a whole so i figured id put my 2 cents in and give potentail buyers a little warning. this is def an album you want to preview before buying, dont go by the one radio hit. make sure this is worth the investment for you before you go spending money on it."
5,Evanescence rules.,"Evanescence is one of my fave bands.I just love ALL kinds of gothic music.They're great! If you liked this album, you'll like their older ones too...Their older album Origin has many LOVELY Evanescence songs.I recommend these bands for Evanescence fans:Nightwish, Linkin Park, H.I.M"
5,Evanescence-Fallen,"I only heard one of the songs by this band, so I bought the cd I love every song on it I've had it for a few weeks and I just can't seem to become tired of it. It is excellent thinking music."
4,goth rock,"Evenescence has become one of my favorite rock groups. Amy Lee is awesome, and the band's sound is unique. I love the music, the lyrics, and captivating vocals of Amy lee. I'm always looking for music artists with their own sound; Someone who can be original, and not just copy everyone else. I also like they're Goth image."
4,I really enjoy listening to it,"To tell you the truth, I didn't really like a few songs on Fallen. ""Everybody's Fool,"" ""Taking Over Me,"" and ""My Last Breath"" didn't work for me, but the rest of the songs did. ""Going Under"" caught my attention when I popped the CD into my boombox the first time. I don't think I can ever describe you how hauntingly beautiful it is. ""Bring Me to Life"" deserved to be a hit single: hard rock and heavenly vocals are easily a good combination. The piano version of ""My Immortal"" is featured here; prefer the full band version, though, but it's still likable. ""Haunted,"" ""Tourniquet,"" ""Imaginary,"" and ""Hello"" are some of the more satisfying songs that really pleases both ears. I'm not a big fan of Evanescence, but I do enjoy listening to this album occasionally."
1,Not The Best.,"The first time I listened to the CD, I loved it. After that, it went down hill. All the songs gets old really quickly. Along with radio play and TV play, it just gets very boring. All the song sound the same and it just doesn't cut it as a good CD at all."
2,This album is way over rated,"While I was my gf's house today she introduced me to this band saying their one of the greatest of all time........... After 2 songs I knew already this cd wouldn't contain any rockers. The more the cd played the more my ears hurt. The music is terrible, I getting very sick of hearing amy lee piss and moan about how sad she is awww poor baby . The only reason teenage girls listen to her is because they feel they can ""relate"" to her pain. Give me a break!!!! I saw an interview she did with VH1 and she self proclaimed herself a ""Gothic Princess"" How arrogant can she be. So she can write good lyrics, good for her but most anyone can write about depression if you think about it. I'm not feeling this album nor will I ever feel it. I'm sure I wont get any helpful reviews but the truth hurts."
4,excellent start,"Evanescence uses a forumla that works really well on this CD. Amy Lee's high soprano operatic vocals over catchy guitar hooks and smooth melodies about pain and anger are displayed throughout this CD. I do think that Origin displayed more musical diversity when it came to songwriting for evanescence but this album was polished to reach out to a target audience, and I'm sure their follow up album will display more of their songwriting and musical composition skills. The videos from the album are really well done and having meaningful messages, they will continue to make great music videos in the future too I hope."
2,don't buy this for the first 2 songs,"The first 2 songs-the ones on the radio-are a fluke. The rest of the CD is banal. Their sound is cool, but contrived and not put together properly. The lead singer's voice is strained sounding-which is straining to listen to."
1,Clear Channel rocks my socks oh yeah!,"Here's something to blast out of your Sony boombox during Greek Rush! You saw the video on TRL and hear the song all the time on every 'cool' radio station! You know your Quiksilver-clothed peers will think you're really 'cool' to be listening to it! Who needs to explore any other music when your favorite music brand, Windup Records (home of Creed!) is spewing as much as much music out as you could possibly want? It's like Nike, just do it! Remember, kids, buy Windup! It's worth every penny of your hard-earned mall job dollar. Buy this because it's really cool and it's a lot like Lincoln Park. Don't forget to pick up a few Abercrombie pullovers at the mall! AAAAAArrgh!"
5,Evanescence rocks,"To those of you who say they are over rated kiss my a**. You obviously don't know real music when you hear it. Amy Lee's vocal's and Evanescence's lyrics are the most moving and inspirational words I have heard from a rock or any other kind of band in a very long time. I have been a country music fan for a long while but Evanescence has brought me back to life, so to speak. This album is absolutely fabulous I love every song and have stayed up many nights just listening to it."
4,Interesting,"This is quite an interesting proposal for a 2003 for a debut album. On it you'll find a rough and powerful guitar sound combined with well achieved keyboard and choral arrangements plus introspective lyrics; all wrapped up with beautiful female vocals. The result is a record with quite a unique sound: dark and heavy but harmonic and beautiful at the same time. It's true that the CD could have been much better, but it's really difficult to find a band of young kids willing to do something musically different, mature and significant; that alone is remarkable. If you like well done rock music then ""Fallen"" is a must have."
5,Great CD. Great voice.,"If you mixed Sarah Maclachlan and Linkin Park together, you would get Evanescence. Amy Lee's voice sounds very similiar to Maclachlan in certain songs, particularily ""My Immortal."" That song, and ""Hello"" are two of the saddest songs I've heard this year. ""Bring Me Back To Life"" is perhaps the most overplayed song on the radio this year but it tells you that the listeners want to hear it. It took me a while to come around and finally buy this CD but I'm glad I did. One minor annoyance is the 2 versions of ""My Immortal""... the music video has the full band whereas the CD just has the ""quiet"" version. I hate it when artist do this and it is not fair to the listeners. I'm guessing that the band didn't want the video to be the Amy Lee show. I hope guitarist/co-founder Ben Moody rejoins the band. Definitely one of my favorite CDs of the year."
5,Staying Power In Talent,"This album is a great way to break into the national music circuit. It has pop appeal, and rock heart. Their sound is like no one else on the market today. The band sounds amazing, their talents come together to create some soul-stirring music. I bought the CD after hearing ""bring me to life"" once on the radio. The CD has been in my player non-stop since then. I'm sure this will be the first of many amazing albums from this band."
5,evanescence,their music is truly unique and about things you can really relate to and understand. i think that amy lee has a great voice and the memembers have a great talent with their music
3,its ok...,well their are good songs but if ur lookin for sumthin u can listen to a lot this is not the cd it gets very old very soon
5,Simply Amazing,"WOW is all i have to say for this CD. I purchased this CD after hearing the single ""Bring Me to Life"" playing on KROQ. My first reaction was it was Bjork on steriods until the drums kicked in, right then i knew i was in for a treat. And a treat this CD is. Starting from track one of going under, a great track remminiscent of some Linkin Park stuff, through awesome songs like ""Tourniquiet"" and ""Everybody's Fool"" this CD never stops. They are musically right on, the lead singer has an amazing voice and the lyrics are haunting, disturbing and remarkably clean, what else could you want? A must have for anyone, truly a remarkable CD that i love to death.-Shadow Wolf"
3,Lacuna Coil !!!!!,"Ok, I just wanted to let people know that this band sounds just like Lacuna Coil from Italy. Lacuna Coil have been around since 96 and have 3 albums out. I give Evanescence credit for what they've accomplished in such a short time, but give credit where credits due. In short, Evanescence are nothing original. Check out Lacuna Coil!"
4,Good album,"I'm enjoying this album so far. As a fan of both goth music, heavier rock, and the female voice, this album is right up my alley. Deffinately worth checking out for anyone interested in the above. And if you like this at all, please look into Tapping the Vein. You'll find their music somewhat similar, though far more intense."
1,I hate this band,"This band is so terrible. It's fun hating them! C'mon, join the ""I hate Evanescence"" club! It's fun!"
5,Best Album of 2003,"Evanescence's debut album ""Fallen"" is the greatest debut since Flaw's ""Through the Eyes"". With the amazing vocals of Amy Lee, the sick guitar playing of Ben Moody, and the rest of the band, this album and band are off the hook. If you don't like Evanescence, you've got something wrong with you. The riffs are amazing, and overall, this is one of the greatest albums of all time. My favorits songs are Taking Over Me, My Last Breath, & Haunted.1. Going Under 5/52. Bring Me To Life 5/53. Everybody's Fool 5/54. My Immortal 5/55. Haunted 5/56. Tourniquet 5/57. Imaginary 5/58. Taking Over Me 5/59. Hello 4/510. My Last Breath 5/511. Whisper 5/5"
3,Thish CD is not on par with thier earlier albums.,"Thier best music is buried in the past and not likely to ever be re-released. I don't have a problem with Fallen, but unlike Origin this disc will never rate five stars with me. Untill I hear something that reminds me of the band I fell in love with I'll stick to Lacuna Coil, Nightwish & Within Temptation."
5,They're Making it BIG!,"Evanescence comes out with their new album, Fallen today. Initially, I had doubts, but every doubt was shut down. I was blown away with masterpieces like Tourniquet and My Last Breathe. Every song on here is top of the line. Amy Lee's stunning vocals are of those to be desired. Pick this up if you can. I am TELLING you to get your butt off the couch, put down the Doritos and Pepsi, and RUN to your store(Circuit City has it cheaper than amazon, haha) and buy this album! A must! 5 Stars out of 5!EvBoard ROCKS!"
3,Nothing new or groundbreaking,"I'll keep this short and sweet. LACUNA COIL has had this style (that Evan is trying to emulate) since 1996 when they put out thier first EP. It's been done and by a much better band than these guys. If you like the style but want more substance and talent, check out Lacuna Coil:ComaliesUnleashed MemoriesIn a ReverieAny song on any of the above Lacuna Coil albums has more substance, style and talent than the entire Fallen CD."
2,Horrible..,Cookie cutter modern rock. I wouldv'e gave it One Star but I watched the video for this cd and Amy Lee has nice thighs/legs.Anyone who buys this Cd might as well buy 50 Cent's Get Rich Or Die Trying. It's that bad.
1,Terribile vocals,"I can't believe how many people rave about Amy Lee's vocals, to me they sound like fingernails on a chalkboard. Some of the music is ok but the vocals are enough to make a sane person go crazy."
2,It's bad if MTV is all over it!,"After all the great reviews I've been reading here, I decided to check this album out - how very disappointing it turned out to be. People are raving about this because they obviously haven't taken the initiative to discover better music on their own. As usual, they take the lazy route of letting a MOVIE SOUNDTRACK point them to a their latest ""fave"" artist, instead of taking the time to search out the much superior forms of this ""gothic metal"" genre - bands like the oft-mentioned LACUNA COIL! People - stop letting the marketing geeks run your life. You love this band because you don't know the alternatives. If you think Evanscence is so great, then you'll absolutely [love] Lacuna's latest album ""Comalies""! But, of course, most of you won't hear it, because it's not on MTV or a on a Big Movie Soundtrack!! Your loss."
2,"Fallen= okay music, stupid lyrics",I am sick of people saying how deep and beautiful the lyrics are on this album. The lyrics to every song on here are extremely melodramatic and they are most definitely trying too hard to be gothic. I know many depressed teens who could write better lyrics than this. I am being nice and giving it two stars because the actual music is okay.
2,what?,"Okay ""Bring me to life"" is the only good song on this. Who wants to hear this goth stuff it's just a person singing being depressed. Be like D-rad and listen to Good Charlotte."
5,Simply Great,"Evanescence is one of the best bands ever. I'm not exaggerating here. Every single track on this album is good or great, with one exception (""Hello""). This is something that I cannot say about any other album that I've listened to. I've never been much of a goth-rock type, but I love this album. Even my mom likes some of the songs! This group combines deep, emotional lyrics with beautifully written, rockingly performed melodies. The worthless Realmedia samples on this website cannot do this group justice.Buy this album. Period. You'll be glad you did."
4,Sound's like Lacuna Coil....... and that's great!,"This is definetly a good album and worth listening to many times. BUT! Lacuna Coil from Italy does the same thing since 1996. When I first heard the song Bring me to life I thought it was them! Anyway, it is sad to see that being backed by a major label a band is instantly succesful while others doing the same thing have to work for years.Now enough of my complaints. Evanescene certainly deserves the good ratings because this is a top class album. Personally I'm a great fan of combined male & femal voices. It give's the music a great atmosphere & melanchony. Very good."
5,One of the best CD's I've heard in a long time.,"This CD is worth every penny I spent on it. It is one of, if not THE best CD I've heard in a long time. The music is very haunting and and emotional, and Amy Lee's voice is stirring and beautiful. There are no bad tracks, I especially like Bring Me To Life and My Immortal. My Immortal is my favorite track. It actually brought tears to my eyes, the vocals are so emotional and very heartfelt. I would recommend this CD to everyone."
2,future one-hit wonders,"I hate to be the guy that likes only the Big Radio Hit, but that seems to be the case here. Yeah, ""Bring Me to Life"" is a good tune -- textured, swelling, and rocking when it gets going. And, yeah, she's got a great voice. But the rest of the disc is sort of faux-gothy, lyrically lame, and plodding in that cliched, Linkin Park way. It may appeal to those under 20, but older, discriminating listeners won't find much here."
5,The Best CD I have!,"This CD.. has to be the best ive listened to.. Amy's voice just sends goosebumps down your neck. My favorite songs would have to be ""My Last Breath"", ""Imaginary"", and ""Going Under"". If your really into songs that make you want to wonder what they mean (It took me a while to understand what the song Tourniquet means), or if you just want something cool to listen to, this IS is the album for YOU! I highly think you should get this CD!"
4,"""This Band Rules!""","With so much corporatized music out there, Evanescence has defintately come up with a distinctive sound. A great combination of hard rock and dark rock. Some people may think ""Bring Me To Life"" is overplayed, but it is a song that definately gets you pumped. Thankfully, Evanescense is not like so many other bands who seem to put all their effort into one great song and turn out 8 or 9 others for the album that lack any power. ""My Immortal"" shows a softer side to the band. ""Tourniquet"" is really freaky, but I love the guitar and the overall feel of the song. ""Everybody's Fool"" has terrific energy. Along with some solid musicians, Amy Lee has a dynamite voice. The best way to describe it is think of Patti Smythe of Scandal fame, only an octave higher.If Evanescence doesn't drastically change their sound, they should be around for a long, long time."
3,Gothic Hardcore Pop,"I liked this cd when it debuted but after awhile I noticed the repetitive lyrics and melodies. She says ""Screaming Deceiving and Bleeding for you"" in Going under. In Tourniquiet she says ""Im dying, praying, bleeding and screaming"". It's okay for a spin every now and then but not for excessive listens."
1,You all think you are superior to me,"just because your t-shirt says ""You laugh because I am different, but I laugh at you because you are all the same.""Well read my t-shirt you little wannabes.""You laugh at me because I am the same, I laugh at you because you are wearing a t-shirt that you feel somehow makes you superior to me because it has a catchy slogan on it created by corporate execs to milk money out of your demographic."""
1,I've had more interesting music come out of my ass!!!!!,"I'm a fan of good music like Tool, Ozzy, Iron Maiden, etc...so when this crap started getting played all over my radio I was PISSED! How the hell was this ever put in the metal category!!! This is exactly the kind of music you would hear if Snow White decided she wanted be hardcore...but at least if that had happened her music videos would have included some midgets!!! Theres a reason why some of the customers that bought this bought Jewel...IT'S THE SAME MUSIC EXCEPT WITH SOME UNIMPRESSIVE GUITAR. Another thing I'm sick of is people telling me that if you didn't like the ""bring me to life"" single that you'll like the rest of the album. So I listened to it and it took me till the cd ended to find out that the cd player WASN'T stuck on repeat!!!! DAMN YOU EVENSCENCE!!!!!AAAAAHHHHHHH!!!"
1,Dull as toliet paper,"This is another tool imitation without the charm nor the artof it's band, the singer is no christina aguilera, rolling stone magazine call this one metal domination, there is absolutelynothing dominating about this band, the band is pointlessIf you want real metal, go pick up hammerfall, this is a failureof all points."
2,all right at best,"This band has made a very good attempt at the moody goth feel they put out. This band is definately not a new style since there are plenty of European bands that use a similar set up. The band seems to have a lot of influences from the Italian band Lacuna Coil, which I highly recomend to anyone that likes this band. Overall the band did ok, but I reccomend trying out Lacuna Coil."
1,Bottom of the pile,"Dont buy this cd, if you want to listen to some real gothic metal listen to Lacuna coil, the gathering, or nightwish. Evanescence [isn't good] there guitar riffs are very similar to linkin parks. There music is nothing new, and all you people that say you have been looking for a cd like this for a long time, you have got to be kidding me. There are many other female rock/metal singers with alot more talent then Amy Lee.Go buy a real cd."
5,Evanescence is a shining star well overdue,"In this world of albums so rampantly produced and thrown into the public, it's a wonderful sight to see a well-produced, melodic frontier album that reaches a new era in the progression of music today. With such powerful songs as Bring Me to Life and Haunted, it captures your ear and doesn't let go until you find yourself headbanging to an eerie trance. In addition, this band has a wonderful diversity with ballads such as Imaginary and Hello which make you want to cry at the thought-provoking lyrics and beautiful paino melody. Take the time to listen to this album carefully and lose yourself in it just as I have."
1,This is boring talentless mainstream garbage.,"If you wanna hear a good band check out Lacuna Coil. Lacuna Coil has female vocals over beautiful metal music. Evanescence is just a mainstream mindless nu metal band with a not so good female vocalist. Lacuna Coil is the band you should be listening to, they actually have talent and mix female vocals with REAL metal instead of cheesy nu metal. This cd doesn't even get stars due to the fact it was made for the simple fact that the musicians are money hungry. AVOID THIS CD IT IS HORRIBLE."
5,Resonating,"I bought this CD breaking one of my cardinal rules: wait until two singles come out and you like both before you purchse the album of a new artist. That usually kept me from making a mistake in what i wanted. However, i knew i wanted a new CD and after asking around i finally decided on Evanescence, as i heard great things about it. It didn't leave me disappointed! This CD is fantastic and one of my favorites of all time. I can listen to it over and over again without becoming bored. Amy Lee's soaring voice along with Ben Moody's incredible guitar create a sound that is 'a breath of fresh air' for rock fans and mainstream alike. Listen to clips of the songs on ... if uur still unsure... imaginary, tourniquet, and taking over me are particulary good. Don't forget to check out the new video for going under!"
1,Uninspired.,"I had been hoping that this band would have original-sounding female vocals but was horribly mistaken. The lead singer's voice is very uninspiring and dull. She sounds like she just got out of her voice lessons and is following all of the rules; whole notes held for 4 counts, etc. There is little original feeling, just preoccupation with the technical aspect of the voice. The rest of the band sounds like a carbon copy of Linkin Park. I don't like Linkin Park in the first place; I really don't want to hear another version of them. The unoriginal sound of Linkin Park is revisitied in Evanescence. They're also just as overplayed. Overall, this albumn was a disappointment. A big disappointment."
2,"Beatiful Voice, boring music",The truely sad thing here is that Amy Lee's beautiful voice is wasted on this trite collection of music overlays. The music which accompanies her angelic voice is boring and cliche - it sounds like throw-away material from linkin park. The best we can hope for is that Amy Lee goes solo or else finds someone who can make a musical score on par with her breathtaking voice. 2 Stars - best not to waste your money...
1,BOOOOOOOO!!!!!,"Really, people think Amy Lee is good? She is horrible! She couldn't sing if her life depended on it! If you want to listen to music in the same genre, listen to Linkin Park!"
3,A phoenominal voice,"When I first heard the song ""Bring me to life"" on the radio I was amazed by the lead singer Amy Lee's voice.All though this music is not metal to me it's more on the light rock side and sound's more like new age music.The song ""Bring me to life""is one of the only song's on here that has a heavy backgroundat some point's in the song.But overall her voice isphoenominal and it will leave you breathless.Especiallywhen you hear ""Bring me to life"".I'm not crazy about therest of the album but I only love that song.I don'tlike it just because it's not heavy or metal.I listento alot of different music but this band just doesn'tcut it for me."
5,What some poeple might say.,While I was interested in what some poeple thought about this cd I was surprised to find one person and being the first person to say anything about this cd was a 2 out of 5 and I am here to say they never heard it as a matter of fact there whole spill of what they said about the band must have been someone else cause this Evanesence is nothing like that. I found myself wanting Amy Lee to hold her and comfort her as I bared her lose of something and the strings of Moody made me want to kick the arsh of those who wronged them. This cd will pull you into it and never let you go only down fall is its only 44 mins long I NEED MORE?!?!?!?!!
3,This is Goth!!,"OK, first this is a good album.Second, this is also a marketing miracle. Just about everybody thinks that Evenescence is a Nu Metal band, and it is promoted as such. But with the exception of ""Bring Me To Life"" and one or two other tracks this sounds VERY close to European Goth Metal bands like The Gathering or Lacuna Coil. Tracks like ""Whisper"", ""Tourniquet"" or ""Imaginary"" are 100% Goth while the ""ballads"" are much darker than your standard metal ballads. If you really like their music then you must check out the last two albums by the italian goth band Lacuna Coil (""Comalies"" and ""Unleashed Memories""). You'll then discover the band they were inspired by (or for others the band they ripped off).So this is a good album ... and a marketing masterpiece."
3,"Not bad, but it sounds almost like a Linkin Park ripoff.....","I heard this CD at a Virgin Store nearby, and I was pretty impressed. Nice vocals, good melody, WHAT?! these riffs sound EXACTLY like the ones Linkin Park uses. Well, they [took] that from Linkin Park, but the rest of it sounds OK. I'm not a big fan of this band, and I haven't listened to the whole CD so I'm not going to judge too much. All I'll say is that in my opinion, they're trying to copy Linkin Park in a way, except not rapping in it. But I could be wrong, I haven't heard all of the CD, so take a listen for yourself."
5,Refreshing,Refreshing. That is all I have to say. Evanescence is basically comprised of Amy Lee on vocals and Ben Moody on guitar. I bought this album the day it came out and have not stopped listening to them since. They are amazing. Their music has a gothic punk rock sound about it. It is amazing. I just don't know what to say to express how much I love Evanescence and everything they stand for.
1,Horrible.,"How is it that people can compare Evanescence to Linkin Park? Linkin Park has WAY more talent than these posers would ever have. Hell, this isn't even 'goth'! It's completely POP. THe singer's voice is horrible; it's whiny and annoying."
2,I can't believe people enjoy this,"What a sad age when morbid music like this becomes the newest biggest hit. I've never been a fan of Evanescence, although I can understand how Bring me to Life made it big. For those of you who are into this depressing music, go ahead and buy it. but for those of you who already have enough problems of your own, do yourself a favor and stay away from this CD. I have to admit that Amy has a pretty good voice, though."
3,A NEW ARTIST HAS RISED.,"Evanescence with their CD ""Fallen"" has crashed onto the charts already going Double Platinum.Their first single ""Bring Me To Life"" hit Billboards Singles Top 10, and their next single ""Going Under"" is sure to follow.The lead singers voice is magnificent with such energy, sound, and passion. Not heard in many singers nowadays.Only problem I do have with this CD is that it begins to muddle all together. Our lady of voice needs to have a little more range and not sound continuously the same in all the songs. The album is strong, the songs are really good, she just needs to change her personality in voice from time to time.A good album. A good recommendation for the rocker enthusiast."
3,A really great printer..until it breaks.,"The Photosmart 7260 is a fabulous printer when it comes to print quality. When using the correct paper (I use the HP Premium Plus) you can get true photograph quality prints from your digital images. I really couldn't ask for better quality from that standpoint. The downside: I managed to get about 150 photos out of this printer before it decided to break on me. The mechanical gearing inside is loud and now gives me the most of my troubles. Often, the cartridges get stuck/jammed and a reset is required. Most recently, the printer color has gone bad and the printer prints images much more red than they should be and I have not been able to fix this even with the help of HP. The price is right, but with the troubles I've had over a year of ownership, I would consider other printers before this one."
2,Paper Eater,My girlfriend and I used this printer for less than a year before it began to give us paper troubles. It started by losing its alignment and then began to mangle the paper on its way through the printer. We both need to print plain boarding passes so you can imagine the trouble this causes when the scanners at the airports can't read the printed pass. We recommend that you pay a little extra and get a printer that isn't made to last a day longer than its warranty.
1,"Slow, Very slow............","I am very disappointed in this printer. It is the slowest printer that I have ever owned. It takes forever to print out a page at the normal print setting. The print head will print one line and then pause for a second and then print the next lint and pause etcetera... etcetera, until the document is printed. I have spoken with tech support and after trying several different fixes there has been no improvement. I have tried this printer on several different machines running Windows XP PRO via a USB Cable and get the same results. I have to print in draft mode to get any kind of normal speed out of it. If you are the type of person who doesn't mind a painfully slow printer (like watching the grass grow) then I guess that this printer will suffice. But if you want any kind of productivity out of one then I suggest you look else ware."
1,Do not buy,"Item does not come from listed seller, it comes from ""The Frame Shack"" and it does not have easel back or glass as described. Poorly constructed, nails in back instead of swivel hooks, looks like it was made in high school shop class."
4,Excellent,"""Life"" by Lauren Tratar is an excellent book that delves into some astonishing information about the nature of personal reality, negative energy vortex, adamantine particles, and magnetic evidence. This is a very valuable workbook and guide. Firstly the reader explores their present beliefs, and then identifies what is wanted out of life, and finally how to use the law of attraction to manifest what you really want.Also included are some extremely vlauable tools to guide you back on your path if you've lost your way.A must read for anyone who is serious about personal self development work.Some more powerful books that I recommend are:The Astonishing Power of EmotionsNexus: A Neo Novel"
5,Who doesn't love ducky's???,"This is the best toy for baths, playtime in a pool or just to play size order with other duckies you have. My 2 year old niece had to have one after seeing my 8 month olds duck. (I even play with it).Rubber ducky, your the one......"
5,Legacy of Love and Courage Enriches Greek Family,"From the Old World to the New, this Greek family lives through good times and bad, guided by the courageous spirit of Grandmother Hrisanthi. Living as a child in rough, frontier-like Butte, Montana, in what was considered the wrong side of the tracks, the author finds fun and adventure in her rich family life. After finishing college, Pappas moves first to Washington D.C., then Los Angeles, where she begins a distingushed career in hospital public relations. We see L.A. in all its smog-free freshness and gaze through star-struck eyes at old-fashioned Hollywood glamour. Joining her in L.A., Pappas's family combines their beloved Greek traditions with all the cultural advantages of a burgeoning city. A trip to Greece fifty years after her grandmother left melts the years for Pappas and renews firm family bonds with the family that never left. The same indominable spirit of Hrisanthi lives on, in Greece and America."
5,Science Fair Fun,This is a good book for ideas and how-to information for any student entering a science fair. Gives parents relief from worry about what to do!
5,AWESOME,"I first heard this song when I was on business in Los Angeles. I was with a colleague and we were hitting Orange County (home of No Doubt) to check out the beach. I turned on the radio in the car and this was on. I recognized Stefani instantly and started dancing around...I loved it. My colleague said, and I quote, ""What is this? I don't like punk.""HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA."
2,Boring Tripe,"It must be the fact that Will Smith starred in this film because I can see no reason why Hitch was so successful. It's not that funny, it's not that original, and it's not nearly as good as I would expect from Will Smith. The only good thing I can say about this film is Kevin James was great."
4,Hitch - Keeps you laughing!,"I really liked Hitch. It starts out a little slow, but then once the plot thickens, it gets really funny and stays that way till the end. I have seen it twice. When I left the first one, I said I wanted to see it again and that is unusual for me! I say ""Go see it."""
5,HITCH,Hitch is a terrific movie that is acceptable for my teenagers to watch. I really recommend it.
3,Pretty Good,"This film had its very funny moments, even though it was dumbed down to about seventh grade humor. Get ready for that seventh grade humor(ha ha). Will Smith is a pretty good actor and it's fun to watch what his character will do next. Kind of a formula picture, but it's good and fairly innocent fun."
3,Wouldn't have much life without Kevin James,Hitch is about a love doctor (Will Smith) who helps geeks get the girl. He's smooth and cool and Smith plays him well. However him working as a love doctor only gets interesting when Kevin James' (The King of Queens) character is introduced. That's when you get all the laughs and when the movie comes to life. He plays a nice heavy guy who's desperatly in love with a rich popular women. So Smith does everything in his power to make him cool. Their scenes together are great and when the movie works the most. The Smith story just isn't as good alone without James so thank god for him. Don't get me wrong the Smith scenes where he's trying to get a girl but keeps messing up are pretty funny. James though with his goofy dancing and charm steals the movie everytime he's on screen. He's great in the King of Queens but also shows here that he could have a bright movie career. Him teaming up with the Rock could make a pretty entertaining movie.
4,A Classic Movie,"This movie was an instant classic. There was lots of funny scenes in the movie and there was also some good scenes in the movie. First off, the part of Will Smith as Alex Hitchens was a great acting part and a great casting pick. This is a Will Smith movie that I like with no aliens. Another great actor that was in the movie was Kevin James (King of Queens). He played an amazing part as Albert Brennaman. He was funny and showed a lot of spirit into this acting part. I never watch his TV Show, but I liked his acting part and thought he was funny. These two make the storyline of the movie interesting as the storyline is when Albert Brennaman has problems with the ladies and needs Alex Hitch to help him get the girl of his dreams. Another great actress in the movie was Eva Mendes as Sara Melas. She played a great part again in a comedy. That is all I have to say about this movie. I hope that this movie does good in DVD's as it did on the Box Office."
5,Best comedy all year!,"This was one of the best comedies that I have seen all year! Will Smith has some awesome acting, the supporting actors/actresses also kick butt. Great movie!"
4,Will can do it all!,"I love this movie. Will Smith can do it all! He proves once again that he can take any role and make a great movie out of it. I never really saw him as the romantic comedy type but it works for him. I don't think i've ever seen a bad Will Smith movie. I was a little aggravated by the way they pumped up the movie Hancock. Hancock was definately no masterpiece but it was definately funny. We need more good romantic comedies with black people. I'm tired of watching Matthew Mcconaughey make a fool out of himself. Let someone else have a chance. LOL, Hitch is a very funny movie that anyone should be able to enjoy. I give it 2 HUGE THUMBS UP. You better buy this one. HOLLA!"
4,"Funny, light, fun","Plot is predictable -- in the ""goofy guy gets the hot girl"" genreHowever the particular steps along the way are a lot of fun. Lots of clever lines and very funny scenes.Will Smith is outstanding. If you like him you will enjoy this."
2,What Happened to Overzealous?,"It's changed to overeager! Why do they do that?Hitch is a date advisor who gets geeks hooked up with gorgeous girls who wouldn't look at them otherwise. They have to be rich geeks, though, otherwise, Hitch can't take them on, he doesn't do this for free.This could have been a good movie, but it just wasn't. Don't waste your time or money."
2,amazing artists,"I think I'd rather own all of this series instead of just the 'Best Of' -- I don't think you can pull cuts off the Porgy and Bess and plunk them down in the midst of a compilation disc and maintain a flow. It jars the cd. I have to skip those cuts and play the entire Porgy and Bess later on.The first is the best, but I have to get them all to do E & L justice. I'd say skip the Best Of .. get the others. If you don't have Porgy and Bess, that's a good place to start.I read a funny quote of Ira Gershwin, something to the effect ""I never knew we wrote such great songs until I heard Ella sing them."""
3,Its okay,Typical movie of one taking care of the less fortune and you know what it is going to happen next all the way thru it I just couldn't get excited about this one at all Not a bad movie but not a great one either
1,Defective product,This product was not as represented. It did not play. It was obvious that the item had been opened and resealed. I did not receive a response from the seller.
1,Mice and Men,The movie does not work at all. I tried to watch it on 4 DVD's so my product was unsatisfactory....Will not buy this type of product again on Amazon. I did receive the product in a timely manner.
5,Classic,"For anyone who has read the book, this is a great remake of the classic. History and English teachers could use this as a great movie to not only support the book, but also provide a visual of life during the Depression."
4,Good Movie,"This movie was good. I have not read the book so I cannot comment on its accuracy. To me the movie lacked a bit of beauty and inspiring awe I was expecting; however, I did enjoy it and would recommend to others."
2,"Cute, but wouldn't buy again","The gnome is cute, but it is extremely light so it falls over every time the wind blows. The colors also faded fast, I'd say within 3 months."
1,Worst Textbook,"Simply put this is the worst textbook I've ever read. If there was a negagtive star rating I could give it, I would. Stacey's attempts to draw analogies between business and other completely unrelated topics are overdone, belabored, verbose, and very frustrating. This book continually causes me to ask the question ""Is the author going to make a point before the end of the chapter?"" This book was an assigned textbook for a course I am taking so I am being tortured and forced to read it. Strange and wacky thinking doesn't equal innovative thinking!!!If you don't have to buy it, DON'T and then beg the instructor to change his/her mind and switch to another textbook."
4,devil costum,"My daughter adored this costume! ! Great except for neck piece. She wouldn't keep it on due to it being too itchy. Other then that, perfect. She loved the pitch fork:)"
1,Not Good,It looks cheap and unimpressive flashing like a carnival light at the county fair. I refused to put it in my vehicle and took it to my shop to give away to a kid as a toy.
2,Not the Best...,"It works, but that is about all I can say. It doesn't look real at all compared to any car alarm light I have seen, and it drained the two AAA batteries in less than a month despite me turning it off in the day. I would not recommend this to anyone."
3,when they work there gr8,"i bought 6 pieces and the ones that worked i thought do the job well, they look real and fit well in the car.however no doubt the quality is very cheap and one of them did not light up (hence did not work at all)"
1,In One Word: JUNK,"This is a cheap piece of junk made in a well-known foreign Asian land known for producing junk. The two lights are NOT LED and do not flash quickly like a real security system. They are dull lights, alternating from one to the other. Don't waste your money or batteries. Anyone will tell its fake. I threw mine in the garbage...wasn't worth sending back."
5,This movie is the reason I own a DVD player!!!,"I told my friends that this was coming out on DVD. I wish you could have seen the looks on their faces. I loved this movie the first time I saw it. It's got action, love, more action! I have been writing to WB and everyone else on the net asking when this is going to be availible. Finally! This is a great movie to add to your collection!"
1,"Michael Mann, if it ain't broke don't fix it!","Waited like many others in GREAT anticipation for the DVD of this film to come out and was COMPLETELY let down. No Clannad song, good lines and good scenes cut out, stupid lines and awkward meaningless scenes put in. What on earth were you thinking, Mr. Director? We wanted the theatrical version. We STILL want the theatrical version. PLEASE I beg you re-release the theatrical version on DVD and/or BluRay."
2,The Last of the Mohicans- Blu-ray,"Have nonBlu-ray format. Not satisfied with Blu-ray edition. Movie didn't transfer on Blu-ray in the area of color, brightness, and vivid landscapes as I thought it would."
4,What were they thinking?,"This is my all time favorite film (with the best movie soundtrack I have ever heard), I must have seen it over 15 time and I still look forward to watching it again... However, what were they thinking when they edited the last fighting scene between Magua and Chingachgook? They could not have done a worse job... in my opinion by making it less 'violent' they have spoiled the film's for those who have seen the original. There were scene alot worse through out the movie (when Magua takes the heart... need I say more?) so why edit the most memorable scene of thes the film.On the positive side, this film has an extremelly good soundtrack, the music is so atmospheric... Anyway, the DTS is a real bonus as this soundtrack on DTS sounds fantastic.On the whole, if you've seen the original you'll be annoyed at the ending. However,if haven't seen this film you'll like it very much, especially with the DTS soundtrack."
2,Director's Cut,"This movie is one my all-time favorites BUT not this version. The Director's Expanded Edition really changed from the original - the only expanded scenes I noticed were at the battle of the fort. The wonderful theme song by Moira Brennan was entirely cut out of the waterfall scene, which, to me, was one of the most beautiful parts of the movie. I'll sell this one and go back to the original theatrical version."
5,Thrilled,"I had this movie on video years ago but it was stolen. Now I have a big HDTV & this movie is so thrilling! I had a friend over to watch it & we were both on the edge of our seats & crying at the end! Thank you so much, Amazon. I have yet to be disappointed with any item purchased on your site."
1,The Last Of The Mohicans (blu-ray),"We have the regular dvd of this and were hoping for a better quality picture(one of our favorite movies).Upon viewing,we were terribly disappointed in it.Our original copy is actually better!Not sure but would love to return it otherwise it goes into our garage sale stack."
4,Better than these reviews give it credit for,"I don't see any of the problems the previous reviews of the blu-ray list and I have a top-of-the-line Sony system. Yes, it is a little dark, but that coincides with Mann's vision of using natural light. I don't see a tint at all. I had low expectations for this release, given the reviews on here, but I must say, I was not displeased with my purchase. This is one of my favorite movies of the 90's and it looks and sounds so much better than my DVD version. Maybe rent it before you buy it if you're skeptical, but I think the people who talk about a tint need to check the settings on their system."
2,The director's expanded edition dissapointment,"I bought this movie a while back on DVD glad to see when it came out. Excited I put it in as soon as I got it. Probably the biggest disappointment I've had in a long time. It was no where near as good as the VHS. Much of the dialogue is removed, including the before mentioned conversation between hawkeye and cora and several others. Some scenes and dialogue were added, but mostly deletes. The sound track does not align with the scenes very well. It is obviously bent and stretched to accomodate the new stuff. Overall I give it two stars only because it was a good movie before it was re-arranged. I would highly recommend anyone buy the VHS and we can all hope that the company will release the original version on DVD soon."
2,"""I Weel Find YOU!!!"" ... eeeh, no.","Wow, this movie and Dances with Wolves really bored me. Maybe I just don't like American Frontier movies but I didn't understand this movie at all. I think DDL was way more romantically interesting in My Beautiful Laundrette. I thought DDL and Michael Mann were sure things before I saw this movie."
1,review,Could not hear--VERY difficult--fell asleep--very disappointed as I was looking forward to it--overall-bad! I was looking forward to it--and it fell way short!
4,"Good film, unneccesary love story","Much better than Dances with Wolves, The Last of the Mohicans is a stirring Colonial epic that deftly examines the bitter struggle between warring European colonials and feuding tribes. There is a fair sense of balance here, with the honor-based ideals of both cultures coming under scrutiny. The British and the French are typical arrogant Eurocentrists, but Magua is a good example of how a blind quest for vengeance can lead to corruption. My only gripe is the Hollywood-forced addition of a love interest for Hawkeye(though Mrs. Stowe is quite lovely). Obviously a broader appeal was needed but it just seems stale and typical. By contrast the subtle romantic touch between Stowe's sister and Hawkeye's brother was much more earnest.Still, this along with Black Robe is one of the better films detailing the Indian Wars"
2,"Great on VHS, so-so on dvd","If you can still find the VHS version , get it. The DVD is missing a few key moments that were in the original theatrical release and the video.The Disc is ok, but why add some scenes and delete others? This Is DVD!! Put it all on there!!"
5,absolute must-own,"A classic film - well-shot, well-acted, and historically accurate in many ways. A timeless film that will always stand up."
4,The Last of the Mohicans Blu-Ray,"I have viewed the VHS and every DVD that has been issued.And never bought this movie.However when I saw the Blue Ray I bought it.I had read all bad reviews.Then one night while watching HD TV saw the end of a show that told about Mann looking at old paintings.Noticing the shadows and the darkness in the woods.So he made it as real as he couldon Blu-Ray.The HD sound track is just a bit better than the normal DD.I have a way I can switch back and forth from HD and normal fiber optics.Newer movies like Robin hood and Iron Man 2 a huge differance. But it is still a wonderfull movie.Glad I bought it.Good deal, its $24.99 at Best Buy when I picked it up.I'm watching on a Panasonic Plasma which handles black levels much better than a LCDwhich could be why we are seeing so many saying its too dark. A person with a new LED HD TV should have a wonderful viewing of this movie.Of course Plasma viewers will love this movie."
5,"""The Very Best Of The Last Of The mohican's""",This movie is exillarating its shows the difference between the real honestpeople who beleive in keeping the word that they made to the people'I beleive it is also a human interest story that shows people gatheringtogether for a common cause.
3,"Bad quality video, great movie","This film is beautifully shot and one of my favorite movies of all time. The DVD picture quality is very poor and ruins the experience. I am talking about the non-directors cut version.I think my old VHS gold box version is better than this run. Wait for an ""original feature"" with remastered video because you will be disappointed by this one.*Edit* This review is on the DVD, not the movie. This is a major 5 star movie that endures the test of time."
1,Read it- Don't watch it,"As a Leatherstocking fan I was bitterly disappointed by this film. The characters were so opposite of what they were supposed to be that it was absolutely unwatchable. Hawkeye is a classic, (ugly!) character with a very odd, but laudable view of the world in the book. His best friend is Chingachgook. In the movie he is a tough, handsome womanizer who is Chingachgook's adopted SON! These are paltry few of the rotten things about this Hollywood horror. If you want to hear about Hawkeye and the rest, read it the way it was meant to be told!!!!!!!"
3,Not like the book,"The movie was better the second time we watched it. The first time we saw it we were disappointed, having read the book. It is VERY different. (We expected it to be different, as all movies are, but this just barely followed the book's story line and characters.) Once we settled in our minds that it was a completely different story we enjoyed it more, but still found it a bit shallow."
5,What North America only!!!!!!,"I'm Irish living in Australia with a region locked copy of Last of The Mohicans, My player a Panasonic DMP BDT 300 could not play it.On the bright side, the delivery time was above average, if the Blu ray was released outside of North America I would buy it again from Amazon.This is the one Blu Ray I want but could not justify (To my Wife) $400 for the Panasonic DMP BDT 310 Multi Region player."
2,"Gee, you think a decent DVD version will come out next year?","I think its a set up. I think they just threw this together and so many people loved this movie they will want the DVD and then next year suddenly a new DVD edition with special features will pop up. I mean, come on, this one doesn't even have the trailer!It did have the correct ratio and that is something, but it ain't much given what else is out there."
2,Poor Transfer to Blu-Ray,"Good: SoundOK: Prefer the theatrical version, but there is not that much differentPoor: Video transfer. Dark scenes are horrible you can see the ghosting of the transfer and overall the picture quality is not up to par with many other movies.Fox security update. Chances are before you watch this you will have to update your Blu-ray player before you can watch this. Fox likes to do this often, I have no idea why because the new copy protection created for this film was cracked 2 days prior to its Blu-ray release. Which make this whole process a mess."
1,Blu-ray Only- Dark and Yellow Tint!,"This Review applies to the Blu-ray release. I love this movie and as a movie would rate it at least a 4. However, this release has a very dark appearance (i.e. absence of light) in many scenes as if filmed under a heavy cloud cover. It also has a yellowish tint in many scenes. Increasing the brightness level by 100% on my professionally calibrated 65"" plasma couldn't fix the lack of light issue and the yellow tint makes the film look old. If these problems are due to a poor HD mastering process, the disc should by recalled and a ""fixed"" version reissued. If due to the ""directors intent"" I think he screwed up. I don't appreciate a movie that looks like it was actually filmed in 1757 and kept in a box someplace until this release. To bad I gave my DVD version away in anticipation of the Blu-ray release."
2,Movie deserves better,"I don't know why the rest of the world was given the theatrical release of the film, while the U.S. got this mess. The expanded director's cut sounds really great, until you watch it and realize that it also has parts chopped out, and the parts added are missing the score. Unlike the fantastic job Jackson did with the Lord of the Rings movies, this director and studio really short changes the fans with this edition. They should have at least made it a double dvd with the consumers choice of which version they prefer."
1,It sucks.,"Strangely I was watching this last night on tv, and I wasn't aware that it was a director's cut, it's been a while since I have seen the movie and I have some fuzzy memories. I thought that I was going crazy, some of the lines I remember weren't in the movie, the beautiful song was missing and the incredibly moving score didn't seem right. As the movie came to a conclusion I was wondering what happened to the stirring movie I remembered, apparently Michael Mann happened to it. Most of the time I love the new director's cuts of movies I have seen, usually they add to the movie explaining things that might have been left out. I cannot recall a movie that l liked so much in theaters and watched to death on VHS that I like less as a DVD. Truly a failure on the part of Fox and Mann, I will take the advice of another poster and get a copy from England."
2,nothing really good,"the book don't have picture,and really waste you time and moneyto buy it...many time time is the same base recipe with chocolate or peanut batter."
2,Functions,"This is a bare bones game, not much depth, including no stat memory, no ability to steal bases, and the AI is really easy. Very low replay factor."
1,Manufacturing Defect,"I decided to keep the product even though, for the 2nd time, [disc one] will not read on any system. [Tried on Bose Wave, RCA, and auto car stereo].There is clearly a manufacturing defect with the recording process for this CD.The 2nd disc has some great music, but this batch should be reinpected before another customer gets defective merchandise.As always, Amazon handled the return of the first order with speed, security, and accuracy.I will continue to shop with them."
5,"The very essence of Duke, Ella, and swing.","This recording captures the Duke and Ella, and the Duke's great band at the very peak of their powers and artistry. I used to call this record the ""test"" of a party in college. If your house is still standing after ""It don't mean a thing,"" then your guests just don't swing."
4,Liberal's can dish it out but they sure can't take it.,"The title of the book ""The Vast Left Wing Conspiracy"" is a sarcastic play-off Hillary's whole ""Vast Right Wing Conspiracy"" which she claimed when she was defending Bill's inability to be honest with the American people. The fact that moveon.org was initially created with the purpose to defending Bill against that same ""Right Wing Conspiracy"" during his impeachment hearings in the late 1990's just makes even more ironic.Liberals should learn to laugh at themselves once in a while since the rest of the country already is ;)"
1,Conspiracies right and left,"These reviews are probably more interesting than the book. What's so interesting about them is that the reviewers don't seem to get that more than two-thirds of the country are now fully aware of Bush's utter incompetence as a leader. The ""vast left-wing conspiracy"" now consists of a 2/3 majority of the country. Apparently, 1 1/2 years wasn't enough time for a clear majority of voters to figure it all out. But nearly 3 1/2 years later, we all see. This book is a couple of years too late. Today it's utterly ridiculous to denounce a ""conspiracy"" to reveal the TRUTH."
1,Did not last 24 hours,"My dog really liked this toy. However within 24 hours it had a hole in it and the tongue ripped off. My dog is fairly small and was more interested in playing catch than chewing it. I had high hopes since it comes with a replacement squeaker, I thought it would last a while. Other stuffed toys have lasted a lot longer."
2,"Teeny Tiny Toy, no stuffing...","Okaye, this toy arrived in a little padded envelope. It was tiny. It does not look like the photo. It is about the size of a mouse, only it's empty except for the squeaker. I put both squeakers in to make it fill out and squeak more easily.... it's tiny! It is good for a small dog puppy, not a larger breed puppy, unless it wants to play with something the size of a mouse. My dog gets very excited about toys but this was quickly abandonned after a little over 5 minutes. She's 13 lbs. I'm not crazy about the velcro and how you can take the squeakers out, that's something I believe some dogs can easily figure out."
5,great toy,great little toy for my dogs. i have yorkies so they love it and it comes with an extra squeaker.
4,Dogs love it,I didnt realize I ordered a small one but instead of giving to my large breed dog I gave to my chihuahuas. They love it.
3,Small means small,"When they say ""small"" in the title, they do mean small. Very small. The toy fits across the palm of my hand. I have large dogs, this is like a cat toy to them. It seems relatively sturdy, we'll have to see how it holds up. I gave it three stars because it is well-constructed, and you do get extra squeakers. But just note that this is a very, very small toy, so don't bother if you have anything larger than a Chihuahua."
1,Not as described,"I purchased this toy because I was so pleased with the medium frog and medium bear in the same line. This product is 6"" long from nose to tail(not 7""), contains 1 replacement squeaker (not 4), and does not have the inner fleece pouch listed in the description. The medium sized toys had the inner fleece pouch, which is wonderful. My next step is to try and return this item. I highly recommend the medium sized frog and bear, but do not like the small size at all."
1,To Small,The info dose not capture how small it is. Purchased for a golded retriever and he will proabably swallow it!!!!!
1,BROKEN,i ordered 4 of these for about to be new born puppies and 2 out of the 4 had broken squeakers..i understand they're cheap which is fine but shouldn't sell broken items
1,WAY smaller than expected,"VERY small item. Much smaller than other ""small"" sized Kong products I have purchased. My dogs are 12 and 14 pounds and I consider it a choking hazard. Save your money."
5,Wonderful!,"This CD is so wonderful! I like to listen to it especially while studying. It is very peaceful and soothing. Pat is so talented, and I am anxiously awaiting his next album. I encourage anyone to buy this album."
4,A Yes!,I enjoyed this book and recommend all of Grace's books--they're especially great for young teenage girls. They leave lasting impact.
2,Subpar advocacy piece,"This so called ""documentary"" is really a sub-par piece of advocacy for more government funding on hepatitis C. Can be viewed for ""free"" from many online sources such as N*tflix, and definitely not worth $10+."
3,Pretty powerful punch,"This is a surprising little device. While I give it an 'ok' rating, it does pack quite a surprising punch given the small size. It claims to be pretty quiet but this isn't accurate. Does the basic job though. lol..."
4,It aint a cadillac...,"but it does what i need it to do. Not exactly quiet, but its not a big deal. a good addition to any collection"
5,All I can say it....WOW!,"My wife has never had a vibrator before so I picked this out as a little surprise for her. All I can say is, ""WOW""!!! Without getting too graphic, there are claw marks on the ceiling after a ""successful use"" of this item!! Right now my mind is running wild about all the different ""ways"" it can be used! She told me to give it 20 stars!!!!! Yeah...this is a keeper!!!!"
5,Still the one!,"This is such a great little toy. I've used this baby for a long time and I'm just buying my third one. I admit that having to change the batteries is a downer, but it's such a small price to pay for an item that works everytime and does not disappoint. It's awesome because you can use it alone or with your partner. I highly recommend this to all women!!!"
1,The Buccaneer,"Another release by Mr. Turner with only regards to himself. No extras, not even closed captions for the hearing impaired. The only redeeming value is the fact is that it is a great movie and finally, finally released in the original widescreen format."
3,Buongiorno Italia!,It is easy to read and there are many translations available. There is a lot of vocabulary introduced rapidly.
5,excellent introduction,"This is an introductory book, and as to be evaluated as such. Thus it is nonsense to say ""Don't read this; read Popper, Duhem, etc. instead"". And as an introduction to the philosophy of science this book is great, because it does what it is supposed to do: it covers most of the main issues, and it discusses the main theories in a very clear and structured way."
1,Not a good introduction,"At first sight, Ladyman's book looks like a solid introductory book -- nothing exciting, no brilliant new ideas, but at least a good survey of the field. On closer inspection, however, there are numerous omissions, not least when it comes to problems of apportioning credit for good ideas... Old examples get recycled (fair enough), but their original authors don't even get credit (intolerable). The author seems not to care about related work in history and sociology of science, which renders the book useless for anyone with a broader interest in science."
4,Great game for Naruto fans and this was my last game!,"I think Naruto is cool because I am a big Naruto fan I am a fan of the TV Series, The Manga, Soundtrack, and Magazines. I also think this is one of the best new Anime's I've ever seen in my life since Dragon Ball Z. Also this was my last game for the Gamecube because I was waiting for Zelda The Twilight Princess to come out but Nintendo has jumped the gun and decided to put the new zelda game on the wii so this was my last game for my gamecube and I enjoyed it actually and this was my last game for this system and I hope the Naruto fans will enjoy this too."
5,Another Good One by Cunningham...,"Just like is other ""compendiums"" Cunningham is very well-researched, informative, and isn't full o fthe crap and fluff of so many modern publications."
2,Spooky!!,"The book kinda takes to long to get to point. I wasn't really interested in burining incense to get rid of evil spirts, or to envoke some spooky spell. I just wanted to know how to make my own incense. But, if you are interested in occult life style then maybe it's the book for you."
4,Great Book,"This was one of my first aromatherapy books. Whether you believe in the magical properties of herbs or not, Cunnigham does his research and shows how the historical/magical uses of herbs are often related their chemical/medicinal properties. This book is well organized and easy to use."
5,Essential reference!,"This book should be on every practitioner's shelf. Great recipies and you are able to make substitutions, with the help of the tables in the back. Also good for beginners"
3,"good news, bad news","I have to give this book very mixed marks. It contains a whole lot of recipies, but the information on the ingredients is a lot too skimpy. One major fault is the failure to clearly note the oils which can be unsafe to use on skin.Also note that he didn't sufficiently stress that a mixture destined to be used on skin should NEVER be used full strength!I bought it hoping for clear advice on massage oils and was certainly disappointed. I'll definately find the correspondences useful but overall, I don't consider it to be on a leve with his herbal books."
5,"The quintessential book on Oils, Incense, and others",This book was one of the first that I started reading and it still has a very important place on my bookshelf. It is a book for knowledge and reference and I HighlY advise it be purchased and read over-and-over again.
4,practical magic,"I haven't read this cover to cover yet. My copy was well loved by its previous owner because there are a lot of notations, underscores and circles throughout. I am guessing that they tried almost every recipe and marked them up as they went along. So far, I have made some bars of soap and charged some oils. This is very enjoyable!"
3,Not Free SF Reader,"No, this is not a Get Smart adventure. Norman Spinrad's book is about one man's choice with regards to political systems. Three competing forces are at work, basically, fascism, democracy, and a wild card element, an order of assassins. Who, I suppose you could call terrorists, or anything like that."
2,Expensive to own,"If you plan to refill your own cartidges DO NOT BUY this printer. After you refill the cartidge, the HP inkjet utility will not read the new ink level. This leads to a warning before each printing. You have to stop you current work, bring the window forward, click continue each time. It took me 20 minutes to print 24 student mark updates. My old crappy Lexmark 35 did it in one click.HP support offers nothing but ""buy our over-priced cartridges at 25% of the price of the printer."
2,Not happy,"Confusing on what cartridges to use--two slots, 3 choices. Also cannot determine how to print photos in black and white--have to remove the color cartridge to print in grayscale or b/w, no matter the settings. Tech help is not very knowledgeable. Have had good luck in past with HP, but very disappointed in 7660 (and cartridges are extremely expensive!)"
1,gets a big frowny face,"the cd was a bootleg, not from the seller but from kool keith. long story but kool keith did not release these songs for good reason."
1,"GHB has killed many people, disabled thousands more","I am so glad this book is not available anymore. Anyone who is investigating or just thinking about taking this substance, which, by the way, started RUINING peoples' lives while it was still legal, needs to get on the Project GHB website immediately and investigate how many have died from taking this. My son became addicted through fellow bodybuilders, all nice young men at our neighborhood gym, has gone through an agonizing detox, and will go through many more months of rehabilitation. I hope his brain function will return to normal some day. This hellish drug, which has the chemical equivalency of liquid floor stripper, will NOT do you any good. Take a multivitamin instead, and save yourself the ruination of your life. GHB has not enhanced anyone's mood in my family. We have been almost destroyed by this drug. I doubt that this review will be posted, but this is the real life review about this book's content that needs to be read by EVERYONE."
5,A Very Retro Book...,"Jean is a 15 years old girl who is much like many of us as teenagers - shy, not that well dressed, and not very popular. But on the first day of her Christmas vacation, the handsome & popular Johnny Chessler asks her to dance.With much encouragement from her equally geeky best friend Elaine Mundy, she starts seeking Johnny's company in school - and suddenly her life is changed once Johnny actually seems to notice her...In many ways the book is extremely outdated - the clothing styles and the prices at the drive in are perfect examples. While the novelty of going out for a coke may be lost on a generation who practically lives on eating out (or at least takeout) - the issues Jean is going through will speak to most girls her age."
4,Real Teen Life,"hey i really liked this book. It really related to what real girls in high school and sometimes junior high go through. Jean(main character) met a boy named johnny. He seemed really nice but on their first date, he stood her up and then lied about it. She accepted when he asked her on a second date( and he really came) He walked her home a lot and took pictures with her but when it came time to go to the dance which her promised to go to her with, he stood her up again and lied about it. Instead she went with his friend and had an ok time, but he really made her feel special. THe ENd"
2,Small but difficult,"I got this book as a first book for my newly-formed bookclub. Bad idea. I thought it would be an easy read and it was very difficult. Even though the readers had 6 weeks to read, many did not finish the book. However, we had a good discussion about religion. Not for a quick, easy read."
3,Underated comedy,"Critics panned this movie, some saying it is probably the worst Paul Newman ever made. I don't think so. It's good family entertainment. Not an Academy winner, but light, fun and clever. Imagine the problems when 5 one star generals from the US, England and France are all captured in WWII Italy. They can't agree on anything until Allied Command sends in a buck private......with 2 stars. Add a beautiful Contessa, a secret passage in a villa, a Nazi takeover and you'll wonder where it's headed next. But it will all make sense when you see the Secret War of Harry Frigg."
4,Abbey Lincon's take on Washington,"As a relatively new fan of jazz, I must say that I very much enjoyed this album. Her singing is beautiful, and is unequalled by today's pop contemporaries. Prior to purchasing this album, the only exposure I had to Dinah Washington was her song ""the man that got away"" on a verve compilation album. My favourite songs on this well crafted album are ""what a diff'rence a day made"", ""blue Gardenia"" and ""cold, cold heart"". Kudos to Abbey Lincoln on her track selections, which succeeds in capturing various incarnations of Washington's vocal essence."
4,Pretty Good,My son Ryan and I watched this film. It's a fun film for a youngster. A child should probably be at least ten years old to understand it all. Frankie Nunoz is a very good actor as he is in Malcom in the Middle.
1,"The kids might like it, but adults will see its stupidity","Frank Muniz comes back as Cody Banks in this lackluster sequel in which he comes out of kids spy school to track down a hispanic Dictator named Diaz who used to be in the Cia.Lame jokes are abound in this sequel as the jokes will pass you by without making you laugh, although kids might get them (like the chocolate surprise joke and millions of James Bond references)One aspect I didn't like in this sequel are the numerous racial insults and stereotypes in the film ranging from a middle eastern with a bad accent to a black Muslim who plays a trumpet!! Man I don't know how this on screen, it also explains why Roger Ebert gave this film a thumbs down.Still if you like dumb entertainment check it out.PS: Speaking of dumb racial stereotypes that girl who plays the blonde dumb bimbo who belives the lies of Cody is a near riot, at the expense of dumb blonde stereotypes.A few laughs yes, but is the movie good? No."
1,"Boring, unrealistic, bad.","This movie should be zero and a half stars, but since the rating doesn't go that low, we're going to have to go with one star. This movie was copying off James Bond, and got boring after a while. Not a good movie."
1,RACISTS!!!!!,"The sick, twisted, fascist, racist freaks that made this movie are sick, twisted, fascist, racist freaks. British people do NOT under ANY circumstances act dumb. The people who made this movie do not seem to realize that is the truth. SO GO AWAY!!!"
2,Finicky LCD,"I bought this camera in 2002, about 2 months after my son was born. Within the 2 years we have had the camera it has been in the shop 3 times, the 3rd time just last week. The problem is when we fold out the LCD to take some video there is no picture, if you flip the LCD monitor over to the front the picture will work fine, but flip it back to normal and there is no picture. It takes great video when it's working and now that I have XP it works great uploading video to the computer. Unfortunately it has been in the shop about half the time we have owned it. I'm waiting for it to come back and stop working again so I can trade it in under Best Buy's warranty."
5,My Nephews Love This!,I bought this for my nephews in an attempt to get them more interested in sports and less interested in sitting in front of a gaming system. My plan worked for a while. My nephews play on an outdoor asphalt court and have been using this basketball since Christmas. So far it's holding up well and appears to be a good quality ball. I believe we only paid about $20 for it during a lightning sale.We received exactly what is pictured and couldn't ask for more out of a basketball!
3,Not the ball in the picture,The basketball that amazon has pictured is a higher quality ball then the one you get. I ordered the ball thinking i got the Zi/o excel basketball. This basketball is the Zi/o basketball. The excel and this ball are definitely two different balls. This ball is a little harder and not as fine quality. Amazon needs to stop having things like this happen where it puts pictures of wrong merchandise on its website.
3,NBA basketball,"I like the ball overall, but it is slightly out-of-round which is not too bad a thing, but it is a little bit of a bother. I enjoy a purely round ball. It's okay though."
2,Better products to be found,Honestly I'm disappointed that I didn't buy this locally or least look there first. Once this ball got dirty it was no better than any other ball out there. Most of it's grip is gone within a week of using it.
3,Meh...,"it is fine, it is of adequate quality and it works. The key was that is was spring driven - needed no battery - it fit the bill. Nothing special."
4,Crunchy Munchy Music,"Bought this for me and my son, but mostly for me!!! Even though I cannot sing AT ALL, it's still a lot of fun singing karaoke Wiggles!!! This would be great for birthday parties, playgroups, etc!!! Wiggle on!!!"
4,the How Not To book,The author gives ood advice and examples. Updated since last time which is good. I'd recommend to anyone who needs help.
2,codependent no more how to stop controling others and start caring,book was recommended to me but i was not able to keep interest in it to read it cover to cover -
5,Great Book and a Great Help to Me!,Excellent book of you are strugglin with codependency issues or want to know more about it. Easy to read and understand. I thought it was inspiring and gave me a sense of control over my life I've never had before.
4,Great!,Recommend by my therapist. Great book. Very useful and informative. I would recommend this book. Has interesting stories in it.
4,Empowering,"I'm only half way through but this book is already having a big impact on my inner world. It's an excellent guide to the understanding and acceptance of our own reality, soft yet determined in inspiring change. I feel there's a good balance between ""theory"" and ""practice"" and personally I much appreciate the exercises as a crucial tool against lazy victimism. A very empowering tool."
4,Buy the New Codepency by the same author,"It is a great book, but the updated version is definitely better. It really helped me understand how to stop twisting the lives of the people around me."
1,Self-Help Mumbo Jumbo,This book was written by someone who probably never read a medical abstract in her life. It's all based off of other people's work and ideas.Not the best book if you really want to understand the mind or the complications of addiction.
5,Great historical resource,"Baldwin's Flush Times is a great historical resource. Baldwin paints an interesting tale of frontier Alabama and Mississippi and the characters which lived in the region. Overall, a great illustration of the American frontier and the Jacksonian era."
1,Boring,"Thomas Cahill can be an excellent popular historian. But, not here; I have read a few of his books. This is by far his most boring one."
4,An engaging and thought-provoking read,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book, which I read while on retreat at a monastery. No, I'm not very religious -- just like the solitude, and this book was a good one to keep me company. Cahill has a very engaging and readable style, and if he's not as scholarly as some would like, he taught me a lot about the time of Christ that I didn't know before. Though at times his objectivity is overwhelmed by his clear faith, and though he gives the Shroud of Turin a little more credence than I would, I felt that was okay -- I enjoyed reading the work of someone who's clearly passionate about his subject. And I wish we could go back to the faith of early Christianity -- the world would be an infinitely better place."
2,Cahill version of Bible,"I found the book to be annoying and had a hard time finishing it. It felt like World History 101 sprinkled with some of Cahill's own personal bible translations. Jesus speaking of the ""S____hole?"" Hello, hello, Cahill, you say that's the literal translation?? For all the pretentious sophistry, I never got the sense that Cahill has a clue what Jesus and the atonement, or Judiasm for that matter, are really all about. If you want to learn what the New Testament has to say, pull out your old fashion King James version and read and ponder for yourself."
2,Not a good choice,The perfect solution spinning remote control organizer looks nice and the spinning is OK if your too lazy to reach over to get a remote control. The big problem I had and I know other wrote about later is the side holders are just too small to accept most remote controls. I had only one out of five it could hold in it side pocket. I don't like to say bad things about a product but this was not designed with reality in mind.
1,Get something better.,Not a universal fit. I guess they want you to heat it up to mold it to something. Not even worth 10 cents. Just spend the money for a better pod. Go to an actual store so you can see what size you need.
4,Good camcorder in bright light...,"Takes great video in good light situations. Under low light it does a poor job and I'm not a big fan of the build in light (casts shadows; sucks up batteries; limited distance; etc.). From my experience borrowing someone's Sony, that did a much better job. Also, the color seems a bit off sometimes (again, under certain lighting situations). The digital pictures arent' worthwhile (get a separate camera), but from what I understand, that is true with other camcorders as well. Overall though a very nice camera and good value."
1,bad deal,I got this thing and it did not work. Icalled Clarke The phones are disconnected.So I am stuck with Junk
3,They could,They could make this a really cool game if they wanted to. If they made like worldwar 2 instead of some made up adventure. Still it will keep you busy for about a week until you get tired of it.
1,Not the original,I have just received this CD. I thought I was buying an original CD but received a copy. I think that Amazon should make clear that it is a copy and not the original recording. It is my first time buying in Amazon and I am very disappointed. As I live in Brasil it is not possible to send it back.
4,Great phrasebook,"This is an excellent little phrasebook. I'd have to say I like the Rough Guide one a little more, but that is somewhat personal preference.LP gives you a great grammar introduction and gives practical phrases for a lot of situations. The ""vocabulary"" section is a poor substitute for a little dictionary and this is my biggest complaint."
4,"Ready, Set, KM Lite!","Less filling with great taste! Managing Knowledge presents a high-level understanding of knowledge management, a ""just enough"" analysis to understand where your best opportunities are, and an overview of your 90-day plan to implement your prototype/pilot. This book won't help you manage more than a small effort, but ""a journey of a thousand miles starts with a first step"". This book can help you get your KM project underway; other KM texts (Davenport, O'Dell, etc.) will help you to build on your initial efforts."
2,Expensive Wall Hooks,"I would buy single wall hooks instead.This one is okay, but it can get expensive when you buy all the various attachments for the track.A little bit of a pain to install if your wall studs don't match up to the holes on the track."
3,an interesting look at 80s urban America,"The author looks at four cities across the US in the 1980s. The most important chapter is on San Francisco. This was during the rise of the AIDS controversy. Nowadays, this chapter seems outdated. But at the time, it was quite interesting. I think urban studies majors or journalism majors may find this book quite useful."
4,"The other day, on PBS, I heard and saw","Enrico Caruso perform the most famous aria from Pagliacci--remastered, on the stage, in black and white. My God! THAT'S the way he sounded! The last time I heard Caruso, it was on a record, which sounded like it was being played with a thorn needle--tinny, faint, full of scratches. So he really WAS the greatest tenor of them all...Some day, this 1990 movie will be given the same treatment, but until then, I will content myself with a good sound track, acceptable subtitles, and a weird, wonderful story.And try to remember how those bolts of cloth looked, unrolling, collapsing on themselves, in the brilliant colors they originally had."
2,Amazon should not sell these titles,I believe the quality of this transfer (along with the one for Raise The Red Lantern) is so horrific that it completely ruines the beautiful experience of watching these Gong Li/ Zhang Yimou movies and should not even be offered for sale. Truly Bad
5,Excellent quality,"This was purchased for my son's 13th birthday. I had looked at microscopes in the $25-50 range, figuring it would get beat up quickly, so why spend very much. A store had one of those cheaper ones set up, and I was very disappointed in the brightness and distortion at the edges, and it felt cheap. So, I jumped up another notch and purchased the My First Lab microscope for 90 bucks. For about twice the price, this thing is 100 times better! It is very bright and completely free of distortion. The eyepiece is easy to look into with a wide field (compared to some where it was impossible to hold your head still enough to peep through). We've looked a all sorts of things, but the most fun is to put a few leaves and a sprinkle of dirt into some water, let it sit a few days, and then look at a drop under the scope. Little critters swimming everywhere! My kids can't get enough of it."
3,Extremely basic,"Found this book a disappointment. The info is accurate, but definately nothing new that a beginning writer would not know about."
4,Bangin,"After listening to this CD the different styles keep me on edge to here the next song. Great Production and a variety of rap styles. Album seems to have been recorded with all rap lovers in mind.Favorite Tracks: Y2K Connection, Paper Chase, For the Good Times"
4,Sandle sizes run small,"I went off of their sizing chart and they stated if you wore a size 10.5 to 11 mens, a size 10 sandal will fit. However, this is not the case. I'm a size 10 and ordered a size 10 thinking I'd rather they be a little big instead of small. They arrived and they are a small size 10. If you wear 10, you'll need size 11."
3,Comfortable but not for the long haul.,"If your looking for a sandal / flip-flop to last more than a summer look at other options. I love sandals and this is my third pair of Reefs, they are very, very comfortable and served their purpose for a summer of use. After 3 months of wearing them around the house, out on short treks and basically hanging out they worked great. Reef always has the cool surf styling too. I was just hoping this pair would last more than a year to wear around the house during the winter, not the case, the right and left heels are almost completely worn through. Great sandals short term but I'd shell out the extra 10 or 15 bucks for something you'll get more wear out of."
1,cliche tales written in whimsical style,"Predictable tales of the most exhausted type written in self important pompous language. What saves the reader from abyssmal boredom is the presence of little details and asides between the lines. The author is an observant thinker with a keen eye for a grotesque surreal details on human condition. For great Jewish stories please read Singer, Buber, Malamud and others."
2,Love 'em but where was the Quality check,"I like just about every Foo Fighter song. They are talented musicians and songwriters. They also have a showmanship that is exciting. Okay, I'm saying all of this before I say that the quality of the DVD was low in comparison with most any other music DVD that has come out in the last several years. Did the team that put this together check with the band first? I think not. The songs are great, but... Compare it to the likes of Linkin Park (live in Texas), Dave Matthews (live in Central Park)??? I'm sorry and disapointed that there is no comparison in ""sound quality"". I am looking forward to the next DVD from the Foo Fighters and will buy it anyway. But, have your Quality Control check it out first."
4,Great Live Shows plus nice hidden goodies,"The Toronto show has great sound, and gives you a good example of what the Foos are doing live these days. The DC segment with acoustic rendetions of a few songs has both great video and sound. Actually, all of the normal ""shows"" are great, but the cool thing about this DVD are the hidden goodies. You may have to try playing it on your PC to find them all, but there is a great story about and live performance from Nilfist, a band from Iceland that the Foos stumbled on while dining out the night before their show. There are a couple of other small hidden film clips here and there. Good stuff!"
3,Interesting topic,"Not the best read, but a very interesting topic and another way of analyzing human behavior."
5,Buy this book.,It is by far the most informative guide to human interaction. Well worth the money. But use caution in using this book for practical reasons.Read all the way through before using!
1,short lifetime with 12v AC,"I bought 8 of these for backyard lighting powered by typical low-voltage landscaping line (AC-12V). So far, only one has survived. The average lifetime for each is < 2 weeks. Not worth it. Not sure if they last longer with DC power."
3,Great brightness but life is a little short for me,"I'm using these off a low voltage line to light up some light posts in the front yard. Knowing that those transformers produce 12VAC. I installed the lights after a full wave bridge rectifier giving me 12.3VDC on my meter. So far I only get about 6 months out of these bulbs. (about 1200hours). There are only 2 other LED lights on the same transformer, so voltage drop when the lights start up are not a problem.At $10 a pop, They are adding up fast!Maybe if your using them on a battery with voltage regulator your get better life out of them?"
3,One Night Stand (1994 Film) [SOUNDTRACK],"Moving, but I expected more from this soundtrack after Figgis' Leaving Las Vegas..."
3,Drama Queen Watch- Pink,"I absolutely LOVED this watch-except for the band. It was absolutely gorgeous, better thant the picture. It is very glittery with all the Swarovski crystals in in, but the band was very uncomfortable. I like the watch so well I contacted the seller to see if there was any way I could just get a different type of band, but there was not so I ordered a different Fossil watch, still with Swarovski crystals and a pink face, but with a much more comfortable band. The problem with the band on the Drama Queen watch is that is protrudes from the band and it will cut into your wrist if you have to rest your wrists on something (I type for a living). I really hope Fossil fixes the band problem becasue I would still get this watch if it were not for the band."
4,A little idealistic.,"In the perfect world, this would be THE book to have. Unfortunately, this is anything but a perfect world and this book falls short in dealing with the realities of the profession. There is too little information and guidance for those that don't have a document-centred employer.Also, the book is purely for those creating user documentation - if you write any technical material (such as requirements, design, UAT, or implmentation documents) this book will be of minimal help. Don't expect any realistic help in dealing with developers either.Fine book, but only for a narrow field."
5,If your a fan of retro tv westerns>this is not to be missed!!!,"Hundreds of t.v. westerns filled the airwaves in the mid 50's until apprx. the mid 60's.This one stands out among the best of that era.Each episode is very compelling with superb acting,writing,production and a virtual who's who of great character actors and name guest stars of that generation not to forget the lead(Paladin) portrayed by the inimitable Mr. Richard Boone,one of the most underated talents of his time."
2,Factory problem?,I bought this brand new and sealed but three of the discs are clearly sub-standard with scratches and fingerprints; how can that happen? The result is that 5-6 shows are unwatchable.
2,Not as good as season one,"The second season was put togeather in a rush. No payng attention to detail. Material was good once you got past how they messed up the DVD's.One detail that was messed up is most episodes you could not hear what was being said as he drew his gone before the story line started.One detail that was messed up is the DVD's defaulted to spanish and thier was no easy way change it to english, so I ended up in this big loop every time I started the DVD."
3,Great band; wish the audio quality was better.,"I love the Los Lonely Boys; their studio albums leave the listener wanting longer guitar solos and further explorations of the musical themes they create. So, Los Lonely Boys live must be a real treat; unfortunately this album doesn't have the dynamic range I would have expected and I found myself straining to listen to the complexities of the songs.I've heard other live albums done at the Fillmore that were recorded better than this one, so my expectations were pretty high. Might try other Los Lonely Boys titles and come back to this one only if you're trying to have all their titles."
3,"Great Performance, bad recording quality","I'm a huge LLB fan. This was a typically fantstic performance by the Garza bros. However, the recording quality leaves a lot to be desired. This is especially evident when listening to Henry's guitar solo at the end of ""Heaven."" There's a lot of static and distortion. It's like the recording channel that was recording his guitar had a bad connection. I can't recommend it b/c of this."
4,It's what you would expect.,"It's basically what you expect but, taking in consideration what John Lennon said about the trip was that, ""It was NEVER CONSUMMATED. But we did have a pretty intense relationship."" That's exactly what they followed in the movie including the famous bathroom scene. So rating this I give it 4 stars for following the facts they have. But the ending was dumb."

3,Music and sound,"This cd is an interesting combination of music that is complex and other-worldly, and music combined with spoken word passages that repeat and repeat. That is the part that I don't get. So much of this is interesting that I would suggest that you invest in the lowest price used cd, but be prepared for an interruption in your enjoyment when the voices intrude."
5,A Profoundly Hilarious Study Of Humanity,"This is one of those books that you can never get enough of and it always amazes you with its simplicity and originality. The book is like an endless gallery of human characters lost and exposed by the turmoil of the war. It is a comedy of words and situations, yet it is also in a way the revenge of the small people against the big mindless ""system."" It is the ultimate guide to not taking the world seriously. It is unbeleivably enjoyable. It helps of course if you are eastern european makes it easier to recognize and identify. But still the greatest book ever if I had to choose one."
4,Granpa and hockey,"This is a comforting book about the warm relationship between a grandfather and his grandson, and sharing the love of hockey. The author manages to capture the exhilirating sights and sounds at a hockey game so accurately and the emotions of Matt and his grandad so vividly. Together with the whimsical drawings and colours, it all adds up to a delightful book that we all enjoy."
3,Strange!,"This movie is incredibly strange. I don't think I quite understood it that much. It's one of those movie's where you are not quite sure what went on. One of the chicks is really hot in the movie, and the other one is annoying! I wouldn't buy it again, i'd rent it."
5,I will recommend this book!,A great book to understand what green and sustainable environment exactly mean! a lot of good informations.
1,A Rip Off Don't Bother... It's just an article that tells you nothing,0 stars after I read it I went ... where is the beef ... there is nothing in this article worth ten bucks ... I'm asking for a refund ... rediculous ...
5,Excellent Source of Reference and Guidance!,"Project Management for Dummies provides great insight to achieve results for assigned projects. I would recommend this book for anyone dealing with deadlines to plan, avoid risks and succeed in managing the number of projects in the workplace. It provides questions critical to ask in order to discipline oneself to handle the needs of your company goals. The techniques enrich your role and responsibilities from beginning to completion."
3,Ripped,"I purchased this with pure excitement to receive it. I even left work 3 times to see if I could catch the UPS man. I didn't mind that I had to pick it up from UPS because I was really excited. When I picked it up, the tube was ripped and wrapped with clear packing tape. Opening the tube and getting the roll out was a nightmare due to the fact that the paper was stuck to the clear packing tape. When I finally got the roll out, the paper was ripped in several places from where it was wrapped TOO tightly. At least 2 feet of the paper was ripped. I loved the paper but the packaging really disappointed me."
3,Good book for those interested in recent Chrysler history,"An interesting book that looks at the Iacocca era at Chyrsler. The book reads more like a series of articles (the author is also a journalist) than a novel, but is nevertheless an effective portrayal of Chyrsler, Iacocca and the American and Japanese auto industry of the late 70s thru the early 90s. Lots of background information on the auto industry with interesting historical tidbits as well. The book's only ""flaw"" is its tendency to tear apart the Iacocca legacy with nasty (but apparently true) stories that topple the former auto industry icon, thus providing a counterweight to Iacocca's own biographical portrayals. While not a tightly woven ""can't put it down"" book, it is nevertheless worth adding to your collection if you are an automotive buff or Chrysler buff."
5,A great tourguide!,A wonderful book that highlights the historical sites of Oxford. The pictures and text are incredible.
5,Worked for us!,"We used this to help with our bedbug problem. In addition to steaming our mattress, box spring, and bed frame, we sprinkled this around the bed posts, under and on the box spring and on the frame and along the edge of the wall in the room. It seems as though it has been really effective! We left it in place for about a month and haven't had any bites for the last few weeks!!! Yay!3 YEARS LATER - UPDATE: I guess it worked. Still no signs of the little buggers! Yay!!!"
1,Doesn't do much good,"I bought this on sale and with a tie-in to a poison-free spray. I liked the idea of poison-free products because I have small children; however, I'm going back to toxic waste killing machines for my insect problem. This just doesn't do the job. Ants are building anthills right in the center of the powder. I'm going to have to call this product an abject failure.-Fred"
5,My Husband Loves This Ring,"My Husband and I just got married on June 9, 2007. I gave him this ring when we exchanged vows. I did a lot of searching for this ring and Amazon had the best deal. My husband gets so many compliments on his ring. Because it is beautiful and unique. It is high quality too. Thanks Amazon. You helped to make our day perfect.Laura"
5,Love it!......Great customer service!,"I was totally impressed with this product that I recommended and bought it for my sister. The one that I bought leaked so I was disappointed because I have been bragging about it. It was one factory defect but when I contacted the company about it,I was so impressed with the customer service!They have an A+ customer service! The president himself made sure I was rectified and the wrong was make right. He sent me 3 new back boosters in place of the one I discarded! Thank you very much! This product works and very comfortable support for your back. I use it for my car and it is great for travel as well. It is inflatable to your comfort and another good thing is that it does not feel plastic to your skin since it has a suede-like surface.You can deflate it and put inside your purse when not in use. Great product!"
1,Only worked a short time before leaking air,Very comfortable and I thought I'd get a lot of use out of it despite the flimsy looking seams. I was wrong. Started leaking right away and just gave it up less than 1 year after purchase.
3,Didn't last long,"I bought this to help my recovery from a herniated disk instance.I was moderately comfortable and helping, but lasted for less than3 months of not heavy (i.e., far from everyday) use in a car.There was no obvious reason why it got some sort of puncture."
2,"Just a reminder, not for daily use","As it specified, it is supposed to be used occasionally, such as travel, not daily use. I tried to use it daily at my office, but it soon worn out, and deflate quickly. I have to return it."
1,back booster 1001,i used this back support 2 times and it started leaking air. support ok but i should get more than 2 uses. will not buy another one.
3,ok size for airplane,"This pillow is small enough to use on an airplane, which is what I wanted it for. The picture does not show the mega strap on the back, which is impossible to remove. It was just in the way."
4,It's nice to be able to inflate it to the right pressure,"I got the back booster to relieve minor back ache in various chairs. I can now inflate it to the level I need for any certain chair or for the car. I was concerned the air might shift to the sides away from where I wanted the support, but it is working fine. I don't have the need to deflate and take it traveling, but that will be a good feature should that come up."
1,Works great for a few weeks then didn't hold air,"This seemed like a great thing, I ordered it for the airplane rides on my recent international adventures. But in just a matter of weeks it won't hold air any more. I didn't damage or puncture it, and I can't see or hear where there is a leak. So it's a disappointing addition to the land fill, now being too late to return it. I'd suggest a different product."
1,"Good Shape, Poor Quality","As others have noted, this thing leaks a lot. Basically, it is single layer construction -- like the cheapo type of air mattresses for swimming pools. The outside has a kind of short velour-like texture, which is not bad. Despite the leaks, it works okay for sitting on the sofa. However, I originally purchased it for use during an air flight. I discovered that since the seats are so close now, when I used the cushion my face was too close to the seat back in front of me. I purchased this thing for a reduced price, so the low level use is okay. However, at $20 or so now, it is well overpriced for the quality. I will look for something else to support my back..."
3,Leaks air,"Love the product, but, out of the two I purchased, one holds air and the other doesn't. Put it under water to see where the leak was. One of the seams was leaking quite allot of air. tried to seal it with rubber cement, but it was no use. Finally threw it away. But the one that holds air, I love. I would like to buy another one, but wonder what percentage leak."
1,Back Booster 1001,"DO NOT BUY!!! These are so comfortable because they are adjustable. HOWEVER I bought two of them and both developed leaks, the first one within one month of use and the second within nine months."
1,leaks!,"What a disappointment. I followed instructions and used as directed, but it has a slow leak. I submerged it underwater to search for a puncture, but could not even find the leak--that's how slow the leak is. I reinflated about every 2-3 days at first, then it would not even stay inflated for a full day, so I'm returning it. I wish I knew why it's leaking air, but maybe it's the entire product."
2,myself,"This product is nothing that I thought, is a cheap version of something great, I waist my money and the worse thing is ,I bought one for my sister and sent that over sea,s. after I spent so much money on postage to that country, she will be disappointment with what her sister send her. what a sad story."
5,Very nice detail and great addition ot the collection.,"Really like the incorporation of the year of the ornament into the structure of the church. My only warning is to be very careful with the cross on top, the plastic cross if very fragile."
2,could use improvement,"I ordered these for cream servers at my coffee shop as I felt they were pretty indestructible. While the carafe itself is good, the lids are a nightmare. One broke within a short period of time and the remaining one is difficult to clean and put back together. Keeps the cream cold though!"
4,Decent Flick,"It's a good movie. If you like excitement and a little intrigue.I'm a little confused by the reviews, as I don't think the movie makes ""Irish people"" look bad. I think a lot of people have no clue about the PIRA, or any other paramillitary/terror group operating in Northern Ireland (LVF, UVF, etc.). The fact is, the IRA today is not Michael Collins IRA, in fact, Collins fought a civil war with these people. The movie doesn't place Irish people in a bad light. It places a rogue army in a bad light, and in truth, they should be placed in a bad light, along with any army, Protestant or Catholic, that sells contraband, targets unarmed men and women and accepts blood money from drug dealers and radicals."
5,Patriot Games with Ryan,This is another of the movies made out of the novels by Clavell. This one is action almost from the beginning to the absolute end. Stunning. Exciting. Harrison Ford is a great Dr. Ryan.
2,Texas Chopped III Coast Game,It's ok i think this cd is probley the worst they ever had out..I know that Swisha House can make better cd's the only good song on hear is #3 TEXAS GANGSTA..Peace Out Playas
4,Getting Better All The Time,"Much-improved version of the CD. I bought the previous edition that included the edited (read clean) Canadian? versions of a couple songs. Even the cover on this one is better--the back is not cropped and the image is clearer on the front.Also enjoy the straight-to-cassette versions of Sharona and Maybe Tonite. Would have enjoyed full band demos as well, but at least they left in all the dirty words this time! If I could handle them as a 13-year-old in 1980, you can handle them now."
4,Great bag for the price...,Very good bag for the price. Much cheaper that if I would have bought one like it locally. I'm glad I bought it.
2,Not a great blender,"Glass jar is supposed to hold 40 oz. But if you fill it to 40 oz, contents will spill because they will ride up to the lid. The lid is another problem. Came out of dishwasher all bent out of shape and with permanent stains. Contents were spilling when full even before lid was deformed. Blades are not as sharp as with other blenders. I think that if they were a bit sharper they would take care of some tasks (such as pureeing tomatoes for Mexican rice) faster and better. Bottom line: there must be something better out there. I picked this on the name only, because my major kitchen appliances are so great, but obviously KitchenAid makes better dishwashers than blenders."
2,A Kitchen & Housewares Enthusiast,"Big disappointment. My main purpose for buying this particular blender was to make frozen drinks (smoothies, margaritas, etc.). This blender does not have the power behind the motor to completely crush the ice. No matter how long you run it, you always have a chunk of ice remaining. It runs fine for mixing food and drinks that do not contain anything ""chunky"". Otherwise, forget it."
3,over-rated,How could Hanssen be influenced by this book when he was 14? It wasn't published until he was 23.Philby's background and reason for being a turncoat don't compute. It certainly didn't seem like a story to turn another person into a mole.
1,A pale comparison to Ghost Soldiers,"This is a slight work by a military ... writer who quite obviously rushed this book into paperback reissue to capitalize on the extraordinary success and critical acclaim of the bestselling masterpiece, GHOST SOLDIERS. Mr. Breuer has written 30-some odd military books and is clearly the kind of writer who believes in quantity over quality, and it shows in this sloppy work. Mr. Breuer retells dozens of stories that were orginally reported in the book, HOUR OF REDEMPTION, by military historian Forrest Johnson, but Mr. Breuer neglects to cite or even acknowledge the existence of Mr. Johnsons's book, the first work ever written on Cabanatuan camp, published back in the 1970s. Johnson's book is infinitely better researched and has the integrity of someone who invested heart and soul into his subject. And the extraordinary GHOST SOLDIERS speaks for itself. Altogether, Breuer's thin research, treacly prose, and obvious haste make this book a disappointing read."
4,Very emotional and moving,I read The Great Raid and found it very moving. It's hard to imagine the atrocities that occurred during that time period. I just recently saw the movie The Great Raid and it made everything come alive. Seeing how the prisoners of war were treated horrified me. It's amazing what the human body can endure and still survive.
5,"""what it means to be psychic""","in this book, Jane Doherty shares her life's journey, while explaining her many insights into the world of the paranormal. As an author, she has a way of drawing you in, so that you don't want to put the book down. Her explanation of how we all have experienced psychic moments, and how we can develop this ability more deeply, is the best I've ever read. Jane also talks about ways to find inner peace, and she is a spiritual person who believes psychic ability is a gift from God. I highly recommend this book, you will learn much on the subject."
5,Unlike any other.......,"This is an amazing book, unlike any other you've read. Jane is incredibly gifted and also generous. She teaches you step by step how to open up your mind/energy in a very detailed and descriptive way, and then how to go deeper. Simultaneously, you'll share her own experiences and can compare the sensations and your own reactions to what you are feeling. Also, at the end of each chapter, there are further exercises you can do. Each part of this book is fantastic and very special. I read A LOT of metaphysical material, and have never read a book so complete, detailed and generous with information (general information about psychic work as well as personal information about Jane herself). I have also had the pleasure recently of a personal reading with Jane, and it was a warm, moving, loving, amazing experience. I cannot say enough great things about Jane and this book, as well as anything in this world that she undertakes."
3,An Okay Book...,"I thought the patterns in this book were TOO SIMPLE looking. There is a difference between a ""classic"" look and ""plain"", and I felt this book's patterns were very plain.Also, I expected more patterns than this book contains, it has about 5 sections with a pattern in each for every member of the family. This would probably be a great book for a beginner that wants to make a simple sweater. But if you already make sweaters, then I think you can find better inspiration in some of Melissa Leapman's other books."
1,Unwanted side effects,"Research on this product indicated it would help lower cortisol levels. High cortisol levels can result in anxiety, elevated heart rate. I didn't experience these results. In fact, I noticed an increase in heart rate and a ""pounding"" heart beat when taking the product. This resulted in sleep disturbances and headaches. These symptoms stopped when the product was discontinued."
5,Another great story from the master.,"Very entertaining storyline. Gives the reader another chance to imagine an adventure on one of our sister planets. After reading the horrible end to the Martian series, anything would be good. But this storyline is good enough to stand alone."
5,Love this Printer!,"Received the printer and had it up and running in less than 20 minutes with no problems. Makes beautiful prints that are as good as any professional printing I've had done. The ability to edit at the printer without having to download to the PC first is great! It's very easy to use and I've had no paper jam problems of any sort. Since I am not really technical and don't like to read pages and pages of instructions to use new equipment, I believe this speaks highly of this printers ease of use."
1,Frustrating Cartridge Problems,"This printer was very nice for the first month we owned it - nice pictures with the photo printing cartridge. Then, we had the first cartridge ""failure"" and it has been downhill since. Nearly brand new cartridges fail, producing horrible prints and wasting large amounts of money. All of our attempts to get help from HP did not solve the problem and now we don't even bother trying to fix the failed print cartridges. They still work, just make awful looking print outs with lines through them. I don't feel like throwing away another 30 bucks just to have the nearly full cartridge fail in a couple of weeks! Remember when HP was a sign of a quality printer? I'm starting to forget too!"
5,breadbox one year later,"I originally rated this breadbox 5 stars and over one year later have not changed opinion. In Ohio weather, which tends to be humid, it does a good job of staving off moldy bread. I love the flat top, which I tend to use to store things like small packs of nuts for cereal, pita bread and so forth, even use it to display decorative items. I keep it on full display on the kitchen table."
1,Poorly constructed,"I just opened this package, and am online here at Amazon to return it. My son said it best, ""I could have done better in shop class."" Edges don't meet, rolltop does not roll because of gaps in construction. Terrible construction, defective in my book. I don't know what these 5-star rating folks received, I would love one of those, but this one's going back now."
2,Not Quite Resident Evil and Definetly not Syphon Filter,Ok this game looked promising but now that i have played it i can tell i was wrong. the story is good (kinda silly however) the graphics are passible (with the exception of the sorry character animations that chop along like a scooby doo cartoon) and the control is terrible. but the story will keep you going despite everything thats wrong with the game. now the sound is something great close to perfect voice acting and creepy music. for sound and story this game gets points but control and animation could use some work.
5,You are right there in the action,"This is an annotated diary. So what is written was done so with no knowledge of what tomorrow would bring. So you get a sense of being there. His annotations of each entry complete the book. There are many Flying Tiger books, and all I have read are great, but this one is unique. We are lucky his family said to publish it as-is, and not write the book he had never got around to. Another thing that makes the book real, the diary is in his own handwriting. Beautiful handwriting so you can read it. Mr Smith lived nearby when I read the book, but sadly passed away before I could meet him."

4,Very Nice,"Don't let your coffee brew all day...this carafe is fantastic. Guests love the design. In the past, though, I have found that most carafes need to be replaced after a year or two or constant use. I'll wait until then to give it a 5 star."
3,An Important Episode in American Popular Cultural History,"According to Bob Levin, copyright law has become a way by which big corporations screw the public trust. Back in 1971, a group of artists calling themselves the Air Pirates put out an unauthorized Mickey Mouse comic book that was heavily pornographic in nature. The ensuing battle lasted for about a decade until Disney finally won.This book rates 3 stars out of 5 due to the fact that it is mostly bogged down in all sorts of highly legalistic language and is hard to read by someone who, like this writer, does not have a law school education."
1,the travesty known as duke basketball,Please don't support Coach K and his annual mediocre basketball team that wins through quiet help from officals; its a joke and supporting Duke by purchasing this media propaganda only worsens the fact that Arizona should have won that year (not to mention the other fact that Duke should not have been in the national championship game to begin with). I welcome all arguers in support of Duke because the facts say you will lose the argument every single time.
1,Self indulgent egotistical tripe.,"I was going to flush this book down a toilet; however, I began to think that flushing the book would be disrespectful to the floating excrement. The only true way to enjoy this book is to rip out the contents, page by page, and then burn each one in effigy. I want to hear about Duke's championship season like I want to hear about a terrorist attack. He opens the book by name dropping, then name dropping some more, followed by name drops. I couldn't make it past the third page before my gag reflex kicked in and I started to salivate. I would soon lose my Chalupa. If you are still interested in reading this book, keep an extra bottle of Kaopectate on hand, as well as an apology letter to your dry cleaner."
5,I will Follow Him,"Just take a look at this brilliant cast. All of them are true artist and i believe the last film that Mary Wicks made before she died. She is unfailing in her comic-relief nun who was in my mind, the most expressive comedy actress ever. The film itself is light with a breath of fresh air. The re-worked songs for the nuns is outstanding with a beautiful orchestra to back them up. This is another Hollywood hit film that is a joy to watch over and over again. Or just skip to the songs that you like. The sound in DVD is wonderful especially if you have a 5.1 or 7.1 system."
2,Quality of DVD,"Sister Act is my favorite Whoopi Golberg movie and I couldn't enjoyed because of the low quality of the DVD. I looks more like a copy than an original. I noticed this note in the back ""DISC MADE IN MEXICO"". I don't know if that has something to do with the overall quality of the product. This is the first time that I ordered a movie from Amazon and be disappointed."
5,sister act,This was a replacement for a finally worn out vhs version. No other reason to add more of a review for an already famous film.
4,Appealed To The Masses,"I enjoyed this when it came out, just as millions of other folks did. It had a nice feel to it, good humor, great music and it didn't offend, from believer to atheist. It even had some action scenes. Many movies which combine genres (i.e. action and comedy) wind up successes. It's not a bad formula.Although Whoopi Goldberg is the undeniable star of this movie, Kathy Najimy as ""Sister Mary Patrick"" almost steals the show as the bubbly nun. However, always a sucker for a pretty and wholesome face, I preferred Mary Wickes as ""Sister Mary Lazarus."" She had this shy countenance to her before blossoming with her voice. Maybe that's why she had the name Lazarus as her personality rose from the dead."
2,"Attractive, but extremely flawed","Same as you've already read, this blender leaves large food chunks at the bottom of the jar, very rarely truly blending anything. I called Kitchenaid's tech support, they advised me to start with a slow blend speed, and then progressively move up to the faster speeds. This works somewhat, but frozen strawberries & bananas never fully blend. The motor is stronger than cheapo blenders, but much slower. On the plus side, the exterior cleans well, and I've never experienced the bottom falling out as others have (was the base simply unscrewed from the jar?). Choose another brand or a cheapo."
3,You be the judge!,"I give this product an E-for effort...While it looks gorgeous on my counter top as with most of the previous comments, I must agree that it takes a long time to break up ice or make a smooth smoothie. I don't plan on using it for anything more than the occasional milk shake and I'm not as picky as the other reviewers but I will say this- it's not worth the high price and I sincerely hope that KitchenAid live up to it's reputation and design a better product. A name is only good if you can brag about it. I won't recommend this product to anyone but I won't return it either."
3,Woth the price?,"The black coupler simply disintegrated after about a year's worth of use. And doesn't do a fine chop. Since they make the best mixers, why can't they step up thequality here?"
5,Absolutely Fantastic !!,"Good material, Good appearance, Good performance, Easy to Clean, and Very Quiet. Best Blender ever used."
5,"So much more than the movie, it entices you to read others.","A friend recommended this to me, and as I liked the movie I read it. Wow! There was so much more to the story, especially what happened after the trial. The book made me appreciate Humphry Bogart's portrail! I had always thought it was just his persona, but no, he WAS Cpt. Q."
5,all-time-favourite / THE novel of WW2,"I think I read this book some 15 times. Still every time I close the back cover I feel like I lose contact to good friends: Willie, Steve Maryk, Tom Keefer... and even LtCmdr. Queeg. My all-time-favourite, a must-read."
1,An unfortunate effort.,Flat characterizations and no emotional development mark this text by Phillips. The author seems so insistent on presenting his theme that he neglects the true art of storytelling.
3,Hitch Critters Wheelie Hog,"They only last about 6 months in stop and go traffic, otherwise I like them a lot. If they lasted longer they would be fantastic!"
5,I love these!,"I have installed 10 of these in my bathrooms and absolutely love them. I first saw them in a hotel in Europe. You set the temperature once and just turn the level without worrying about whether the water is going to be too hot or cold. It comes out perfect every time, even when you are half asleep in the morning. Just pull the lever and you get your own perfect water temp! Amazing!There is a lifetime warranty for any part that needs replacing.All my units have gone for nearly 15 years without needing any stop valve replacement, so I think the amount of use is probably the deciding factor. If you have a lot of people using the same shower they might need replacement more often.I highly recommend these. Heaven everyday!"
5,great tool,"Simply a great, versatile, well made stapler. Being an artist and a teacher I find this an indispensable, handy tool."
3,"""The Dribbler"" is truly a good name for this machine","As another reviewer states, ""The Dribbler"" is truly a good name for this machine. It dribbles (actually, spills is a better word) coffee out the edge of the carafe when pouring. Almost every time. The coffee tastes good, so if you buy this, make sure you keep a roll of paper towels handy to wipe up the spillage when you pour."
3,Sweet,"ON Rocky Road's sweetness was a little overpowering at first, but after you get used to it, it's a pretty nice chocolate flavor."
1,Contains Sucralose - No Returns,"Based on the reviews, this seems to be a popular product. I bought it and tried it out. First thing I noticed is that it's very sweet. Much sweeter than other protein powders I've used. My mistake for not noticing earlier but the ingredients list includes Sucralose, which has been linked to migraines, liver disease and tumors. It's also just REALLY sweet so a little goes a long way.Unfortunately the seller does not accept returns so I'm stuck with a 5 pound can of unusable product."
1,I think Amazon gets expired leftovers to sell.,"I've been ordering this product mainly through Bodybuilding.com. I went ahead and purchased this 5 lb., choc. chip flavor from Amazon, due to the fact that I saved on free shipping and no tax.I first opended the product and noticed the smell of it was different. I mixed up a protein shake and immediately notice bland taste to it.I can compare it to the choc. chip I purchased from Bodybuilding .com, which has a fresh taste to it.So, it seems to me that Amazon receives Gold Standard Whey products that have past their expiration date. It still works as I do drink it daily, sometimes twice on the days I work out at the gym. I'm still getting good results and can tolerate the taste.I believe I'll not order this product from Amazon any longer and continue to order from Bodybuilding.comThis is only my opinion, take it or leave it...good luck!"
3,wrong flavor,"I ordered cookies and cream, the flavor on the tin can says cookies and cream but it's actually coffee flavored...wtf? i'll give you 3 stars because i actually got the protein but the flavor is completely wrong. Will never order from again but at least I got some form of protein."
3,Ok product,"It doesnt tastes as great as everybody claims it does. I found Muscle Milk tastes better. In terms of results, I dont see much of it, mainly because i am still in the first month of using it? Everything else ok right now. If I have a better opinion than just the taste, I will drop by later."
4,Tastes Great,"Tastes great when mixed with milk, plenty of protein and low calories. Seems to be working. Only negative is as with most protein powders it likes to clump up and not mix in fully."
5,Great Protein Powder,I got the Vanilla Ice Cream flavor which reminds me of the astronaut dehydrated ice cream flavor type of smell but it mixes well with unsweetened almond milk (reducing lactose). It is not too sweet and the aftertaste is minimal. I chose this brand since it had less ingredients than the others and less artificial flavorings.
4,Protein Absorption,"I wasn't sure how well the protein would absorb but evidence suggests to me that the protein is actually getting absorbed in my body. I donate plasma twice a week for money and they measure the protein levels in your body each time. If your protein levels aren't high enough you can't donate. I would frequently be turned away for low protein levels. After using this product regularly my protein levels have always been high enough, so it seems to work."
5,Flavor great mixes well,"I got the Double Rich Chocolate and the flavor is good, although it could be more chocolatey, triple rich chocolate should come out soon :) It mixes well. It's well worth the price. You can easily find more expensive protein that is not as good of quality, or as good of taste."
4,Cookies and Cream is horrible,"this stuff is great, 1 scoop is 24 grams of protein...the only thing i hate is that cookies and cream doesnt take likse cookies and cream and it has the worst after taste...so until i am up using that im stuck with the horrible after taste...too bad they cant give you samples! lol"
3,Taste is not that good,This Whey Protein is OK. The taste isn't as good as other whey proteins that I've tried. It's a good value for the money.
4,Good stuff,"I'm new to the protein world so I don't have anything to compare against it. But for what its worth, this stuff works and the choc. flavor is great. Have a whey shake before and after workouts and a casein shake @ bedtime, have noticed quicker muscle gains while taking this protein. Will be trying other flavors soon."
3,"Good product, taste not to my liking- Double Rich Chocolate","Got a great deal on the ON 100% Whey powder. Mixes easy using a blender bottle and doesnt taste terrible. Does leave a slight after taste like many other Whey productsHowever, wish I'd just paid a little extra and got the Natural Health Formula Dutch Chocolate which has a much better flavor."
4,good stuff,Not expensive tastes good reputable brand. The only negetive is the aspartame... you might want to avoid this if you drink a lot of diet drinks and get a natural protein powder.
1,fake product,"Length:: 1:20 MinsMaybe the protein powder was fake.It was a very big bottle,but When i opened the cover of the bottle ,i found the sealing paper had been opened. maybe somebody opened it before.It was first i met such thing here .How can i believe AMAZON later?"
1,The Seal was completely broken,"The Seal was completely broken when I got it. I don't know if someone ate some powder and then sent it to me, or add something else into the powder. Sending the item back would cost me too much time."
1,Not sure what others see in this protein,"I exercise at least an hour every day. I take protein after ever workout every day. I have been doing so for quite a few years. During my time trying different proteins, this has to be the worst yet. I really don't see why this has such high ratings. It's a complete ripoff. The price for this crap is terrible! The best protein I have tried to date is by far Body Fortress Super Advanced Whey Protein. The price is much better, it contains everything optimum has plus more more recovery supplements already in it. It feels much more filling and tastes far better. I would recommend staying away from optimum nutrition. If you don't believe me, just try Body Fortress yourself. You can get a 2 pound container for only $15 at Walmart or several other stores/sites. You won't regret it. You will regret optimum nutrition after trying body fortress though."
2,Stomach upset,"I have used other ON protein products with success - I don't care for the flavor of artificial sweeteners, but have learned to deal with it. I have tried this product only 6 times since purchasing 6 months ago. I didn't want to believe that it was causing stomach upset, but today's use has confirmed that it is this product and not a cold or some other food. Not good when you use right before going to the gym. I did some research and found that a number of people have stomach upset with this product - it could be that it is just spoiled, but there is no way to really tell. Recommend buying a small size if you have not used before. I am stuck with 5lbs of whey."
5,Can't go wrong,I have been using this supplement for over 4 years...It is the best on the market as far as I am concerned with regards to price and taste and the low carbs it has....I have friends who own a health food store and usually get a nice discount on the product but Amazon's price is very hard to beat especially with free shipping.......
1,Not like any vanilla ice cream I ever tasted,"I use this product online regularly, but this particular flavor is lacking. The taste is more like vanilla ice cream that forgot it was supposed to add flavor to it. Imagine ice cream without taste and sweetness and you have what this taste like."
4,Good product.,"Taste is always subjective, but this one is pretty good. Clumps a bit when made and requires a vigorous shaking to mix but otherwise a good product."
5,very good whey,"very good whey, great value, taste is very good, mixes pretty well, the best product in it's class for sure!!"
5,quality product,"We all know ON gets consistently rated #1 whey, so thought I'd try for myself. The ingredients in this protein are good, i.e BCAA's, glutamine and whey blend, so it really comes down to taste. This double rich chocolate was delicious and mixed well. I had it with milk but think it will be pretty good with water too."
5,By Far the Tastiest Choice!!!,"We've tried several different brands and flavors for whey protein powder, and the Extreme Milk Chocolate by Gold Standard is by far the best tasting. My kids LOVE when I make a shake with Publix low fat frozen yogurt, milk and one scoop of this delicious protein boost. This is their favorite quick breakfast during the school week."
1,"""Not the best out there""","I expected more from this with having many good reviews and it's claims of being of choice, but after taking this I've realize what a waste of money I've spent. The taste is the worst. I wouldn't dare recommend this to anyone. Has a really bad after taste that leaves you feeling weak and nauseated. And that's not even the half of the problem with this supplement. Right after I take this, I would say with in like ten minutes I'm having problem with my stomach. Quite frankly this product is a gimmic and should be banned. I would recommend to those looking for a protein supplement to look into EAS or Weider."
5,Named gold standard for a reason,excellent choice for smoothies or by itself.mixes very well and tastes good too.i used GNC whey for a long time before i tried this.i can only say i wish i had found this sooner
1,Disgusting,"Mixes fine, but it tastes horrible! The only protein powder that literally makes me gag! My next protein powder will come from Smart Powders."
2,Tastes terrible mixed with water,"I went through 5 lbs of the Vanilla flavor mixing with water and it tasted fine.I decided to try a new flavor this go-around, so I bought Vanilla ice cream flavor. Big mistake, tastes like chemicals. Others have mentioned taking this with milk, so i'll try that."
4,Pretty good stuff,"The flavor is slightly chalky and bland but not bad. I used syntha before this and with milk it becomes nice and thick, this however with milk still stays thin and more like chocolate water than chocolate milk!"
5,No Complaints,"I'm on a quest to try all of ON whey protein flavors. This one is definitely good, but doesn't beat out rocky road. No complaints arrived on time."
3,"ITs good, but not the best","ON is good whey, but it does not tast that greaet and its hard to stir if you dont have a good shaker"
3,"not good at taste, but overall a good protein shake","Just started taking it, taste (Rich chocolate) is not so good but you will get used to it.Definitely better than those expensive Monster Milk and Muscle Milk having more calories and fat.Optimum Nutrition Whey has very less fat and calories, but more protein."
5,A keeper!,So far the best tasting protein shake my husband and I have ever used. I also like it because of the low sugar and carb count. Great when blended with black coffee!
3,OG Whey,"ON Gold Standard is the OG of whey proteins. it is decent value and gets the job done. the taste is nasty to me, which is why i drink syntha now. the mixability is good."
3,It's a solid product..,Optimum Nutrition's Gold Standard 100% Whey is a great product for those looking to get/maintain lean muscle. It contains only 1 gram of fat and 2 grams of carbohydrates while packing 24 grams of quality whey protein in just 110 calories per serving. However this product is probably not what you are looking for if you are searching for a product to gain a high amount of muscle mass. ON's Gold Standard along with a healthy diet and adequate exercise will help you to lose more fat while developing more lean muscles than diet & exercise alone. The only thing I would suggest is that you chose a flavor other than strawberry as I have found it to be the least appetizing.
5,Great stuff!,"This is a great supplement! Tastes good, mixes pretty easily, and I've really noticed the difference in how it helps burn fat. Plus, it's reasonably priced for the amount you get. Of course, you still have to work out hard too, so if you are commited to doing that, I would highly reccomend this product.Mark"
4,good,"the product seams good but it has no big effect on my body, but I think it's my body resistance toward gaining weight."
5,Optimum Nutrition Extreme Milk Choclate,"This is my second order of this product. Tastes very good especially when mixed with coffee and a little Hazel Nut or Irish Cream Sweetener (Torani, sugar free sweetner). Both my wife and I are using this product for weight reduction."
3,Protein,I usually buy my whey protein from walmart and i was looking for something with a little more quality overall i think it tastes the same
4,Tasty and nutritious,"I've tried a few different kinds of protein, and this is my new favorite. Most importantly to me, it's more easily digestible than some of the cheaper protein powders out there. The double rich chocolate is also quite delicious. And to top it all off, Optimum Nutrition isn't too expensive for the amateur weight lifter. Give it a try!"
5,"Tastes Good and Improves Endurance, At Least for Me Anyway","For all you buff, rough, and tuff athletes out there, this is an excellent source of protein to get you boosted up for your game! Need a little extra edge? This protein supplement comes in double rich chocolate, chocolate mint, pina colada, strawberry and vanilla so your taste buds will be singing just like your results! I know, I use this stuff and I think it's really improved my endurance for both my tennis game and my three times a week five mile jogs."
5,To the dude who said this product does not work...,"Because you have one friend that uses this product and hasn't seen results that means it doesn't work? Try using your brain before posting another review. Your friend's lack of progress is not an indication of this products ability to perform its purpose. Whey Protein is not a magic shake that is going to give you muscle. You need a good diet and equally good training in the gym in order to see results. The purpose of protein is to fuel the rebuiling of the muscle tissue you break down in the gym. Since most protein consumption takes time, and is inconvenient directly after a workout, whey protein is ideal. It mixes fast, requires no preparation, and whey is digested faster than any other type of protein.That being said, Optimum Nutrition produces the highest quality whey protein. It mixes well, and tastes great. 24g per scoop is a perfect amount as well. I take one in the morning and two postworkout...among other things."
2,Has caffeine,"I bought the coffee-flavored whey protein just to realize that it's not just coffee FLAVORED, but rather the second ingredient is coffee. So it's actually whey protein plus coffee. Each scoop contains 40mg of caffeine. I take 2.5 scoops, so that's equivalent to a full cup of coffee."
2,Stick with Chocolate,"I have been trying a lot of the protein powder for after my workouts. Most of them have been chocolate. All of which have been pretty good. I really like strawberry flavor. So, I thought I would try a strawberry protein powder. Big mistake. I find myself struggling to finish the shakes. I would not buy this again. My advice, stick with the chocolate flavor."
5,"low carb, high quality, excellent price","I'm pleased with the overall quality of this product. Double Rich Chocolate tastes good with peanut butter, almond breeze, and heavy cream - tastes much better than just water, keeps the carbs low while delivering a good amount of protein."
5,Does it's job,"The flavor is good, I bought double rich chocolate. It's a good price for a lot of protein powder. It tastes nice when you mix it with milk but with water, it doesn't taste too well."
4,Great product,"Great taste, especially if you mix it in with chocolate milk.Good value for money, hard to find another protein powder product as good as this out there for the price"
2,Powdered Milk?,"I tried out this flavor after having Chocolate flavor for a while. This Cookies and Cream flavor has a strong taste of powdered milk. If that's your thing, then by all means."
1,Why didn't I stick with double chocolate?,"I usually use ON's Double Chocolate in the same line. I've been very satisfied with that product. I don't know why, but I decided to try something different. This is very different! It is incredibly sweet. As well the flavor is highly artificial. I've basically just got this sitting around. I don't think there is any chance that I will finish it. So, time to go back to double chocolate.This product is gross."
4,Best flavor of all ON proteins,I have tried multiple flavors of the Optimum Nutrition protein and this is by far the best of the group. It doesn't seem to cause any bloating it tastes great with both water and milk and seems to mix fairly well. The only reason it received 4/5 stars is because there is better tasting gourmet proteins out there. For the cost and for the blend of proteins you get this is a solid purchase.
5,Hands down best protein,"Optimum Nutrition Whey Gold Standard is always my go to for protein however I wanted to switch it up with the flavor and I couldn't resist trying Cake Batter. This protein flavor does cost more than others but it's very tasty! I do mix other things with my drink so sometimes I completely block out the flavor. Next time I will purchase the normal go to and cheaper option, French Vanilla. Cake Batter is good for a switch up."
4,tastes like chocolate milk,I put like 1 and a half scoops in a glass of milk and it tastes good. This product is very helpful for my protein needs. I'm just a little worried about all that aspartame and artificial sweeteners. I'd gladly drink it without that stuff even if it tasted bad because if you have the discipline to work hard you should have it for eating healthy.
4,Good product,This is a really good source of protein. I did not like cookies and cream flavor though. It didn't taste like cookies and cream at all but it could have been worse.
3,Packet not good,"This product seems to be less effective than the firs time I used it, the reason most probably is the online version is not pure. The packet I received last week doesn't have hallmark and the seal is not air-tight. I'm not buying this product online again and advice you the same - To buy it in person rather than online."
2,There are better products available.,"[...]This product, while smelling very chocolaty, tastes like unsweetened baking cocoa which isn't good by any means.I've been using protein powder for at least 7 years now and use it everyday with breakfast. I know protein powder can taste pleasant if not good. There are better products available for those who plan on using a product every day and don't care to take the time to blend in extra ingredients as I do."
4,"Solid product, not sue about the flavour",I have been using ON's protein powder for years: great quality.This is the first time I buy Cookies N' Cream. The flavour is good but really sweet and takes a while to get used to. I do not think I am gona purchase this flavour again but I'll stick with double choccolate and french vanilla
5,Good taste,"Good taste, not as good as the chocolate, but still good. I mix it with chocolate soy milk and low fat yogurt for breakfast. This helped me to drop 22 pounds in 5 weeks."
2,Unpleasant Taste,"I bought this because of the reviews here and on Bodybuilder.com. I am familiar with protein shakes and I know they are not created equal. I typically get vanilla so I can mix it with other things. I could not stomach the flavor of this. I tried it three different times. The first time in a fruit smoothie. Using same ingredients I typically use for a smoothie, it tasted weird. I couldn't finish the smoothie. Thinking maybe some of the fruit was bad, I tried it again with 8 ounces of almond milk. It mixed fine in a shaker cup but tasted watered down and just ... weird. I can't explain it other than just saying the taste was unpleasant.I tried it one last time with just 5 ounces of almond milk. Still gross. My son said it tasted like rancid pudding. I wound up giving the whole tub to my boyfriend."
5,GREAT!!,"#1 protein on the market. Love it.Pro's: easy to drink, inexpensive, easily dissolves in water, low in calories and fat, high amounts of BCAA's in each serving.Con's: None?This protein + creatine (also by ON) and maybe a shaker cup and multivitamin are the only supplements you will ever need. Don't be fooled by all these other scams and expensive proteins.EDIT: just bought the Mint Chocolate after finishing 10 pounds of regular chocolate and needing a change. WOW! Great change of pace. Just enough mint. 10 stars"
4,Tastes Decent,"Arrived quickly and without incident. Tastes decent with water, and quite a bit better with milk. Very good ""bang-for-your-buck"" powder."
4,My only gripe is the artifical sweetener (acesulfame potassium),Great protein powder that is not too sweet and taste like chocolate milk when missed with milk. It is sweetened with acesulfame potassium (Ace K) and is the only disappointment.It would be perfect if it was made with Truvia (Stevia).
5,The best protein from creation to results,"This product dissolves quickly and cleanly, I use a small immersion blender to drop into the glass of milk and 10 seconds later, I'm good to drink. No clumps. Tastes great and 2 of these pups per day with my regimen have equaled 3 lbs of lean muscle. Not a bad trade-off. 5lbs of protein ~ 3lbs of muscle."
5,Coffee!,"I thought any flavor of whey could taste barely tolerable at best (Optimum's Chocolate was the least unpleasant, but still). Well, I just received Optimum's Coffee flavor, and it is killer! Even with water, it's so good, I actually feel like having another for no protein-related reason. It was a bit more expensive than the more available flavors of the same brand, but to me the difference is well worth the extra few bucks.For the record, I purchased the flavor listed as ""Coffee"", and the bottle I received says ""Coffee - Limited Edition Flavor"" on the label, while the product image on the Coffee listing reads ""Mocha Cappuccino"". There's also another flavor listed as ""Mocha Cappuccino"", with the same product image. They might be different products, though the one I have tastes just like those Starbucks Mocha Cappuccino bottles, so one of them is probably a newer bottle label."
4,It's protein powder. What do you want?,"I like it because it is not the standard Chocolate or Vanilla. 20 years of lifting and I can't stomach any form of those flavors. This Tropical Punch flavor has a bit of a metallic aftertaste like a lot of creatine drinks. If you add a squirt of black cherry Mio, it kills the metallic after taste and makes it mighty tasty while adding a bit of caffeine to it."
4,Nice field guide,"I have two qualms about this book.1. It is a book. It is not waterproof, nor even water resistant. For a book on paddling and whitewater rafting, the inability to take it out on water seems a pretty remarkable drawback.2. It has no photos. That's less of a drawback as it's information-packed. You'd be hard-pressed to go two pages without a map or illustration of some kind.Now on to the good stuff.This book is extremely information dense! It lists every lake, pond, creek, river and mud puddle. It rates them in so many different ways (level of difficulty, time to traverse, quality of scenery, seasonal availability, etc.) that EVERYONE will be able to find something that suits them. Whether you are a suicidal daredevil or an arthritic semi-invalid. This book is indispensable to planning your paddling trips."
2,Flavor doesn't last,This gum has good initial flavor but it doesn't last. It also takes at least 3 pieces to get a comfortable chew. Extremely sticky.
1,Do NOT buy this,"Despite what the photos and descriptions show, this product has plastic bottles. Flimsy, thin plastic bottles. They fall out when you rotate the rack and don't fit properly into it. The spices in the plastic bottles were aged and turning brown. I do not recommend this product at all. Buy something, anything else."
3,Not as good as it could be,"The jars are plastic and don't fit in the rack very well. The rack is a tad smaller than the older model that looks similar, and so the glass containers from the old rack don't fit well in the new rack that I bought.Personally, I'd prefer glass jars that are empty so I can put my own spices in. I use a lot of Cumin seed, smoked paprika etc, which don't come in this rack, and just can't bring myself to throw out the spices that were included.All in all, I only gave this product a 3 star rating, IMO it looks better in the picture than what actually showed up at my door."
3,Spice Rack,"This was the item I had been looking for, but the construction was poor. The racks were not glued to the top or the bottom and fell apart when open trying to use. I did reglue and it was workable."
4,"I had to buy another copy, haunting stories","I read over & over my copy of Winter's Tales & one day on a flight from Omaha to STL. I sat next to a Russian Foreign Exchange student & he had no friends in the US so I gave him my best friend ""Winter's Tales"". A great colections of tales as told around the fires during the darkness of winter."
1,Hadleigh asks and Bette laughs!,"Want to learn something about Hollywood from the Queen herself? Wrong book.Whether she spoke or not, whether it's printed here or not: Some remarks and questions of the interviewer are ridiculous.Only a few answers sound like Bette and it's a good example for what she had to deal with all her life: millions of silly questions and small talk.However: thanks, Bette, it's fun how you make fun of it and refuse ...For everyone who want's to get to know Bette Davis and enjoy a great interview: Dick Cavett-Show 1971 and don't miss her laughter!"
2,"Great bowls, but not BPA free.","We used these bowls for our first two children, they were the BEST design we found for a suction bowl. Big enough to be a toddler size plate, but with sides like a bowl so they could easily learn to use utensils. Last year I threw out all polycarbonate in our house, so that meant these had to go. I wish Nuby would make these without BPA because we need something like this again for baby #3!"
3,Not enough suction,I bought 2 of these and both of them lose suction within minutes. I only wash them by hand to maintain life of the product but even brand new they didn't stay down. I would push it down on my daughter's high chair tray and if I sat there I could see it losing suction. I would not buy this product again.
4,almost perfect,"Looks great, quality looks very good too, just be careful with the feedback, the equipment is too sensitive, you need to be as far as possible from the speakers"
3,I read all three,See my review of reindeer hunters and think that is most enjoyable way to read these novels. Check them out
1,Kindle edition lacks navigation,"The kindle edition lacks any navigation features. There's no table of contents, no links to notes, no index. It's a large book, and the kindle edition doesn't allow casual reading."
3,Dated language but fascinating medieval travel account!,"Regardless of whether you think he made it all up, Marco Polo's Travels is a must read for any student of Asian history. From the drums of the Great Kahn to descriptions of the Silk Road, Polo's account is fascinating. Beware of the dated language, however, which makes following Marco Polo's travel route difficult at times."
2,straight & plain narration,"This is just a straight & plain narration on what Marco Polo came across. At times it's quite boring. But I mean no disrespect for Polo as he would still be a remarkable explorer & adventurer even today, not to say in the 13th century where transportation was in primitive modes. Contrasting Polo's map & the modern one is interesting though, as well as guessing the modern places corresponding to Polo's description."
2,You are going where?,"I believe I got what I paid for. There were much better books of great detail, but they cost much more. I would suggest saving your money until you can buy a much more comprehensive book. The reading and information provided in the book was light and was gone over very fast. I question some of the facts contained there in."
4,Poor at Pouring,"I purchased this product because it was 1)a KitchenAid product and 2)I wanted the color.The coffee that is produced is fine, however, be careful when pouring... if you don't hold the cover open while pouring, the coffee will flow outside of your cup."
4,Great coffee maker except for one item,"This coffee maker is great for the price. I like the availability of colors and it brews good coffee. I only wish it had an auto shut-off switch because I always forget to turn it off. I've left it on for two days and the thing still works fine. The only drawback is that it is impossible to pour coffee without dripping everywhere. I thought it was me at first, but even my girlfriend can't pour coffe without dripping all over the counter top."
2,A so-so coffee maker,"There aren't many options if you want a 4 cup coffee maker. This one matches my kitchen and looks really cool, so I went with it. I've been using it for a little over 3 months. It does make good coffee and it's easy to use. But, as an other reviwer mentioned, it frequently hisses and spits at random interval until it's turned off. This doesn't bother me too much (at least I'm in no danger of forgetting to turn it off). But don't even think about pouring a cup before it's done brewing...or 5 minutes after. The basket keeps on pouring coffee onto the hotplate. Even after the 5 minutes, it still drips. It's a mess! Yeah it looks cool, but unless you NEED the great colors, you'll get more for your money with another model."
5,As Advertised.,these are Extra plates that i use daily... they are perfect....they work....i dont care if there pretty.... Im getting bigger.
2,Amazingly Cheap,"2 stars because they way close to five pounds and they fit on my barbell, other than that these are very cheaply made. Lumpy cast marks and painted by a blind elephant."
3,Good new image,I like it as the commerical is so cool; Braun's shaver is the best.This one is no exception!
1,Okay if you want to waste time and numb your hand,"I have an aincent Norelco with spinning blade heads that does a much better job than this thing did out of the box, even though my old shaver has blades which have been in it for a few years. I needed a new razor since the battery is almost toast on that old thing. The Cruzer3 has a lot of power, but it just wants to vibrate its way across the room. It takes a long time to get a good shave with this, and my hand was numb by the time I was done. The screen is no good at picking up longer hairs -- admittedly more comfortable than the snagging that my old razor sometimes does, but the vibration far outweighed that benefit."
3,Ouch!,"I purchased this in June 2007 as it seemed to be the ideal solution for a guy with a goatee. At first, it pretty much matched my expectations - a good three-function trimmer and a half-decent shaver all in one. It's stamina sucks, however. By March 2009 I had to keep my thumb on the trimmer blade extender to prevent the blades from pulling the hairs out rather than cutting them off. By mid-July 2009 this tactic no longer worked and rather than suffer more pain and expletives I now have a full-face beard of over four weeks growth while I wait for my Philips Norelco hybrid trimmer/vacuum cleaner to arrive. If that doesn't do the business it might not help convince my wife I'm not trying to look like Steve Earle but at least I'll be able to give the living room the once over. All I can do with the Braun is throw it away."
4,Great Product,"It took me forever to find a good chain for my glasses. Some were too thin, too cheap, to expensive, too short... It was especially hard to find one online without being about to pick it up. This one is perfect. It's simple, heavy enough to be sturdy and durable, long enough to hand properly without strangling me or resting too low, and (best of all) it's a really good price. Finally!"
4,I like it but....,"I love the convenience of having 40 spices at my fingertips, rather than fumbling through a cabinet and usually having bottles and such fall to the floor or on my tiled kitchen counter. I did re-do all of the labels, though, because I tossed about half of the spices! I tried and tried to find a spice rack like this that had empty bottles, but to no avail. (I am capable of mixing poultry seasoning, thank you very much. And I keep my peppercorns in a peppermill!) Also, be careful of the ""sifters"" as the holes are rather large."
3,Kung Fu DVD,I Bought This Movie Because I Read Somewhere That Donnie Yen Was In It But He Wasn't It's A Good Kung Fu Flick
4,Brain candy,"I won't pretend this is great literature, or even great s.f. But it does make an entertaining read. Take one part *Mystery Men*, two parts Alan Moore's *Watchmen*, mix thoroughly and enjoy.This book is both a parody and an exploration of the comic book superhero universe. The protagonist is a man whose superpower is that he no longer exists . . . sort of. He's employed---sort of---by the man who created the universe . . . sort of. Nothing is quite as simple as it should be in this novel. While Maxey doesn't acheive quite the same character depth as Orson Scott Card, he shares his tendency to explore the mind even of his darkest characters."
5,Time travel is hard...,"Time travel is hard, but Nobody pulls it off. I liked it. I did see the twist at the end comming, but only because Maxey tried so hard to cover it up. A great book."
4,oh if i had the wings of a canary over these prison walls i would fly ...,"poor burt lancaster had just won an oscar 2 years before, and he was running up against gregory peck, peter o'toole, marcello mastroianni, and jack lemmon (robert preston in ""music man"" wasnt even nominated!) so truth be told he really had no chance of winning in this marvelous semi-accurate biopic of murderer-turned-ornithologist robert stroud. while the movie takes considerable liberties with the facts (stroud was much more an SOB than the sympathetic character lancaster portrays) it is on its own terms an eloquent argument for fairness -- even for those barely meriting same. strong supporting performances from karl malden, thelma ritter, and the still-hairy-headed telly savalas. good picture."
2,It was a bad choice to read Smart Choices...,"Unfortunately, I have to burst your bubble. ""Smart Choices"" isn't a very good book on the topic of decision making. There is a book called ""Managerial Decision Making"" that is much better, although it is written at a higher level. ""Smart Choices"" is written at a 7th grade level."
4,Packaged decision making,"A colleague once told me that Steven Covey's 7 habits is packaged common sense. This book is packaged decision making. Doubtless all of us use some or all of the techniques and methodologies described in this book, but probably not in as cohesive and efficient a manner. The authors divide their basic decision making methodology into the following:1. Problem description2. Defining objectives3. Generating viable alternatives4. Evaluating consequences of alternatives5. Considering tradeoffs between alternativesThey also discuss:6. Uncertainty7. Risk tolerance8. Linked decisions9. Psychological traps (behavioral issues)10. How to implement and refine the systemI have just completed the book, and liked the content and the writing which is replete with useful examples. It remains to be seen how easy it is to implement the methodology and make it habit."
4,Indeed a practical guide,This book is able to break down the decision making process into logical steps so that one can actually consciously think about it when faced with a decision.Some of the ideas are very simple and fundamental and we probably used them without thinking. What this book succeed in doing was to show how to look at the whole picture and how the ideas fit in.It was a good idea to used the home buying example though the process to illustrate the initial steps. However it would be better to use a consistent example for the last few topics as well.Was thinking that it would be nice to have a neat one page illustrated road map that can be pulled out and pasted in front of the desk.
5,Good Book,I enjoyed reading this book about a man that gets a job in Tibet at the Holiday Inn which is nothing like the holiday inns here. Had information about the country and some funny parts.
4,A CD PLENTY OF VOICES,"Yes, this is a cd that has exactly 40 arias sung by 40 different sopranos. It is a kind of bunch of flowers or something like that. I think it is a goob job, done by EMI. Why not 5 stars? Because there is not in this cd Flagstad's, Auger's, voices, among others. But you'll like it if you want to know how can all these sopranos sing. Beautifully."
2,"Difficult Read, Fairly Bias","I was disappointed in this book. While the text is broken down into sections and smaller chapters, the reading was often difficult to follow. It was apparent from the beginning that this author is not at all familiar with the meaning behind the Bible and I have a hard time with this. If you are going to write a book and put it out there, you had better do your homework. Otherwise all you do is turn people off from the truth behind a subject. Would NOT recommend this to anyone who care about truth or factual information when reading about the possibility of why you should or should not believe in something."
3,This will probably last 6-7 months with daily use,"With daily use, this lasted us about 6-7 months before it started falling apart.Unfortunately, other steamers are probably of the same poor construction."
4,"All natural, back to basics.","Good quality bamboo steamers. 2 stacks and a cover lid. 10-inch size is big enough for 6 ears of corn - 3 on the bottom and three on the upper stack. (BTW they cooked faster than my electronic steamer which it replaced. I timed it for 20 minutes and they were all cooked evenly.) The cover lid is made of 2 layers of weaved strips of bamboo so no steam is coming out from the top. The handle does not heats as much so you can touch it with your bare hands during cooking. No piece of metal has been used, no staples, no nails, no tacks.Water does not condensates directly on the food as the steam permeates the bamboo and flow back to the pan along the sides. It does not evaporates as much as the water just cycling back and forth inside the steamer. Healthy way of preparing your food as you don't use oil in the process. Just make sure to use some parchment paper if you have to cook something that may stick like dimsums, etc."
1,Not worth having,"It doesn't last long it totally falls apart and I will never ever buy this product again, never. I do not like it!!!"
4,False advertising?,"Bob Woodward says he interviewed over 100 people for this book. But it reads as if the narrative is constructed solely from the minutes of various National Security Council meetings he obtained. That is no mean feat. But this book is not about ""Bush AT War"": it is about George Bush getting READY for war -- in disjointed councils during which only Colin Powell, Condelezza Rice, and George Tenet ever offered the President any substantive advice. Moreover, Woodward barely mentions the feats of the Air Force Special Tactics men and teams from the 5th Special Forces Group which really liberated Afghanistan in only 90 days -- ten months before Woodward finished his book."
2,Woodwards Latest Effort,"In his latest book, BUSH AT WAR, Woodward displays his classic liberal bias towards Bush. Woodward casts him unfairly as a bit of a bumpkin. Also, there is his laughable characterization of Rumseld and Wolfowitz as reactionary and almost malevolent figures trying to influence Bush. Yet, somehow Woodward is able to treat superficially and without comment Clinton's contributions to the whole 9-11 mess and the aftermath. Finally, Woodward demonstrates remarkable ESP powers by describing what various people are actually thinking, even when their words suggest something different.I can't recommend this book as an objective or insightful anaysis of Bus at War."
3,Part exciting part boring,"I was very excited to start this book but I must say that after a while it got a bit boring. Another NSC meeting, another disagreement between the principals !I do hope ""Plan of Attack"" is better !"
1,Save your cash,"I used to respect Bob Woodward, but this book is star-struck, celebrity-seeking drivel. I agree with others who feel the journalist did not dig deep enough. Further, it is abundantly clear from Bush's remarks post-September 11th (""Why do they hate us?"") to his actions in the region right now that he has no understanding of real foreign policy or the issues shaping the region."
2,Give me a break,"Well, we can be sure of one thing. Bob Woodward won't be bringing down anymore governments. He has completely bought into the back-scratching revolving-door Washington set that doesn't want to offend anyone, lest you be taken off the good party list for the next year. He manages to write this without making anyone look even a little bad. His images of Bush are like the old Saturday Night Live skit, where Reagan ushers out the little girl scout from the photo op and starts talking in Russian to Gorbachev. Bush even interviewed with Woodward, and his self-serving accounts go unchallenged by Woodward. This book is an embarrassment, and Woodward should be ashamed. I am a former fan who will not be purchasing anymore of these boilerplates."
4,Pick it up in 20 years,"This is a very good book now, but will become ""great"" as time passes. The only thing holding it back for today's reader is that we know the majority of the plot. Woodward's book is therefore not intended to primarily provide new information, but rather to record history and will be appreciated more by future generations than by us.Woodward's book is important to the Bush legacy. He paints a picture of a man far different than the widely held idea that Bush lacks leadership skills and is only a puppet for the powerful men around him. He also appears to be a clear thinker and lacks no certainty in his decisions.I respect Bob Woodward tremendously. We all know his political views are more liberal than conservative. He had to know he was writing a book that could convince many hedgers that George W. Bush is a solid president. When personal ideology collides with journalistic integrity, Woodward maintains his honor and principles."
4,"It's not about politics, it's about our nation's leaders","I'm currently reading Bush at War, and I'm enjoying it a lot. It's written in a novel form - even down to the ""cast of characters"" list in the front - and really brings to life the events that took place behind the scenes on September the 11th.It's cool...you should get it.Warning: This book does contain some of the real-life swearing, with nasty words like the F-word, and most of the rest."
1,NO REAL INSIGHT to the BUSH PROPAGANDA,No real insight because this book duplicates all the propaganda we read in the papers everyday. Woodward never questions any of the war staff's actions or verbage. What happened to Woodward the investigative reporter? His work in BUSH AT WAR is like a cheerleader for the Bush administration.
1,A shameful exercise,There is nothing here that an close newspaper reader did not know or surmise. What is missing is any mention of why Bush and his geniuses lost the first round of the war in Afganistan because they did not want to lose Americvan citizens' support by taking real casualities at Bora Bora. Or how about the confusion and anxiety of the American people when their leader ran and hid for a day after the attack.It was as if Roosevelt disappeared after Pearl Harbor. What Woodward skips over reveals he his a bag man for the cowards in the White House.
3,More Objective than Expected,"I was surprised when a friend of mine suggested this book to me, because he is very conservative and my impression was that this book was just another anti-bush rant. I was clearly wrong. I thought that this book was an insightful look into the President's War Cabinet. I did feel that Woodward was partial towards Powell over Rumsfeld. Overall, however, I thought that this book was excellently written and I would suggest this book to anyone wishing to learn more about the way that the Bush administration operates."
1,Mohamed F. El-Hewie is a terrorist,Thank god i don't live anywhere near New Jersey where all the terrorists seem to be congregating.
4,Bush Basher,"An avowed Bush Basher, I gained a new perspective on this President. He was the right man for the job in this phase of the war on terror. Must read!!!"
2,"Book Left Loose Ends, Like Bush","I felt the book was informative, and captured many angles. It gave the reader an inside account of Bush's inner circle. On the other hand, it seemed disorganized, which may more be a function of what was really happening, rather than Woodward's style of writing. Overall, there is probably a New Yorker or New York Times article that captures the essence of the book but does not leave the reader wondering why they purchased it."
1,imperialism story of white house,"this is a dirty fact what George will saying about his imperialist aims to the journalist like Woodward, Woodward believed him and wrotes this book.if you love him and Woodward, you will be pleased why he started the war with one of the poorest country in the world. And everyone who are saying that he is a great president, they must be also sick like him!!! I'm very curious for the next election in Novemeber 2004. I don't think that he will be voted again."
4,A political book for both sides of the spectrum!,"Love him, hate him, voted for him, voted for Gore, didn't vote in 2000, none of that matters one spec. The fact of the matter is, this candid look at our President shows that he might have acted with more bravado and character than most of us-not all of us, but certainly most of us. I suggest reading this one. It's a good and honest perspective-from a liberal-that's semi-flattering to the compassionate conservative."
3,One Love: Life with Bob Marley and the Wailers,"I understood that the book was about Bob Marley in the early years before fame, however, there was more information about Peter Tosh than Bob Marley."
5,Do the Boodang!,"This is the sound of man on the hostile edge of the true end of his control over his own increasingly mechanized society -- the A-bomb blew open the door and we never figured out how to put the souless dead-eyed genie back in the bottle -- these are the documents, the fearless maddenings, squeezed out by men who looked into the future, saw its electricity, danger, anarchy and human aggression usurping mind, heart, sanity, order and deep blues. They saw the bones of the future dead on fire."
1,Duff Mackegan Probably wants his bass back,"If you're a serious Rollins BAND fan, not just a Henry Rollins fan, you will be hugely disappointed by this album. Where the Rollins Band was pushing the envelope of the hard rock genre with both of it's first two lineups, this new regurgitated 80's metal falls flat, HARD. Don't expect the creativity of either of the first two lineups, or any knowledge of any other kind of music that isn't driven by mindless powercords & hammer-ons. Sadly enough, the 'Rollins Band' has become completely irrevolent. On the consistent side, Rollins continues his descent into the vocal mediocrity of the past couple albums. Unfortunately for him, he no longer has the band to carry him."
1,"This can't be Rollins Band, please say it's a mistake.","This album is very disappointing. After all those years with a steller, top shelf, amazing, band behind him he comes out with this. I'll buy it because I have all of Henry's stuff, but I probably won't listen to it. Henry, if you read this, please get the old band back. I would hate to see it all end this way... P.S. the spoken word projects are 10 stars all the way."
1,Devoid of all creativity.,"This is nothing Rollins didn't do a thousand times better on ""End of silence"". The band are an average 70's bar band, Rollins lyrics are so weak it's embarrassing and his vocals have about as much bite as Sammy Hagars.Save your money and listen to End of silence - the last album he actually said anything on."
2,Henry's fallen ... can he get back up?,"I became slightly suspicious of Mr. Rollins when I saw him hosting VH1's ""The List"" (Is he a musician or a celebrity? Only his hairdresser knows for sure.). Having been the Fanatico Numero Uno of his other releases in the 90's, I was also slightly suspicious when I noticed that he had a NEW BAND. Gibbs/Hasket/Cain were absolute masters of their domain. Why would anyone get rid of them? But I decided to trust Henry, who had always delivered the goods up to that point. He and his former mates set a tough, tough standard that is beyond exacting. I bought this, and was immediately disappointed by the effort. The new band sounds like generic testosterock shredders/wankers, churning out faceless boogie/grunge/hard rock. The material is hurting. We now know that the quality of Henry's sidemen make or break the effort. This one is broke. History will prove me right."
1,Too tall,This product did not work well for someone 6 feet tall. I had to walk hunched over to reach the handlebars.
3,Adorable little manual-powered treadmill,"First, we love that it is simple and not a plug-in energy hog, and that it doesn't take up much room. It easily folds up and wheels away -- awesome. Anyone can move this around.It is simple to assemble. You screw on the vertical arms -- with the included tools. Voila.But it is hard to walk on -- it is on an incline that takes your breath away almost immediately. I tried putting a large book under the back to lessen the incline, and that did help a bit, but you need *some* incline in order to get walking at a steady pace. (""What is the What"" in hardcover, at 1.5 inches -- is the perfect height)"
1,"Very, Very Noisy....Too irritating to want to exercise on the unit","I received it today and put it together myself and it's terrible. I didn't expect the world, but I did expect the noise level to not be as bad as it was. The grating noise it generates is because the belt (no matter how tight you make it) hangs just enough at the bottom to touch the 2 metal guides that keep the belt on track. The grating noise is so bad, I really have no intention of using the machine again and after putting it together I really don't have the strength to take it apart to return it. Bad buy.Update* I fixed the noise issue but the track jerks and you can't get a good walking pace because it slips and jerks as you walk on it. If I make it loose, it will move to the left or the right, If I tighten, the tread won't move..Update** I'm right now trying to figure out how to fit it into my small garbage can outside. What a waste of money...."
3,ummmmmmmmm,well let me say that i had for a week and so far there's no problems. It's not the greatest but it works. the only thing you can really do is walk and even that's a bit tricky. once you get the hang of it you'll start wondering why you didn't just get the motorized treadmill
1,Quality is not very good,"I agree with most of the other reviews on this. If you can't do it right, don't do it at all. It's a shame because these episodes with the original girls are priceless."
3,not what I expected,"I didn't read the description of this closely enough so what I got was somewhat disappointing. I wanted the years of Linda Kaye Henning, the later years of the show. It was fun to see the Shady Rest again, and the Cannonball, but I would have liked to see the characters/actors I remember from my youth."
3,What happened to the theme song?,"I was so glad to get these old episodes on DVD, however, I was extremely disappointed that the theme song had been replaced by some generic banjo music with no lyrics. I don't have a clue why they did this, but it ruined it for me, because the theme song is one of my favorite parts of the show. But, for the extremely low price, it was worth buying despite the absence of the theme song."
5,Amazing Record!,"I love this record! A friend of mine told me about this guy and I decided to buy it. I wasn't sure what to expect, but I love it. He's got a great voice and I really like ""Where's Bob Dylan?"", and ""This is How She Goes."" Also, ""I Might Look White"" is really funny."
3,Bumcello,"I have only heard one single, ""Beautiful You"" but judging the album by just that one song would not be fair. So with all sincerity, I would have to say that this song is an ecelectic mix of rap, groove and the soft churn of cellos and violins. Very beautiful, no pun intended. I look forward to hearing more of this. If you like music out of the ordinary, you will like this what you hear on ""beautiful you."""
3,Poor Sound Quality,"The Little Princess is great, but the other movies, which are very old, have extremely poor sound quality. My daughter doesn't seem to mind ~ I just blast the volume for a while."
4,To keep handy,"It is a great book to follow the time line of thoughts about Mental Illness. It is a great book for academics/ researchers in the field. It is not an easy reading, but all in all it is a ""must have"" for people in the mental health field and also interested in history."
1,Caution - Missing Sound In Some Parts,"I've bought and returned this DVD twice now because the sound on some of the videos is entirely missing. When I first bought the DVD and had a problem I thought I just got a bad DVD - so I exchanged it for another one and had the same problem. Even in the places where the sound is intact, it is of poor quality. The image itself is also not that good"
4,Helps with itchy stretch marks,I'm on my 3rd trimester and unlucky to have so much stretch marks on my belly. I use this oil whenever I feel itchy and for me it helps by massaging the oil on my belly. I'm just not a great fan of cocoa butter smell..
3,Feels wonderful - smells yucky,"I like the effect on my skin but I'm not a big fan of the fragrance. It smells heavy and thick, and reminds me a little of chocolate - not something I want my body to smell like."
1,Absolutely useless,"This is just an index of patterns with references. To be of any use, it should be a computer program/database instead of a book. It is like using a printed table instead of a calculator to solve the formula. I cannot think of a target reader population for this book. I guess it is for people that know every pattern already, but they've forgotten where have they read about them, so this serves as an idex. A waste of money."
2,Be forewarned,"When this book is described as a listing of 700+ patterns, think literally. No UML, no suggested implementation, no rationale, no CRC - just a brief description of the pattern. And I do mean brief; the GoF's Mediator is reduced to six or seven lines. If you're looking for a good book on patterns, go elsewhere. If you're looking for a good index to pattern material you may already have (JOOP, GoF, Smalltalk Patterns, PLoP books, PLoP conferences, and others) this may be a worthwhile investment as the book includes excellent citation sections."
3,"Great beginning, bad ending","I'm glad I read the other reviews and now I have to apologize to my son. The rubber teeth completely disintegrated on our blender when our son had been using it. We were sure he wasn't using it properly, but now I see this is a common problem with this blender. We had been happily using it to make shakes with ice for about 2 years. We're looking for a new blender and are considering spending a litter more on the Waring Professional."
1,Way overrated - breaks too much!,"This blender is the top rated blender yet it could not ever completely crush ice to make our daily smoothies. There were always big chunks. Also, the plastic spinner on the blade broke every 6 months for the past 4 years!! I kept buying new blade attachments... dollars a pop and now I'm done with it. I bought a waring bar blender instead."
1,Very Poor Design - Like other new KitchenAid Products,"Like many others the black star coupler broke a little over a year. It's too bad that KitchenAid management allows a single part designed by a bonehead engineer to ruin what could be a great blender. With so many others having the same problem why can't KitchenAid managment just swallow their mistake and fix this post warranty for free? Unfortunately this same story can be told on a KitchenAid high end toaster that broke after a year. I am going on 0 for 2 with KitchenAid. But never again. They have lost me as a customer for life as well as my children, and their children. Goodbye KitchenAid."
5,Best Ice Chopper,"After complaining of how we could not master homemade pina coladas because of ice chunks, our friends told us the secret ingrediant... this blender. We received it as an early wedding gift and have used it for everything! It makes wonderful milkshakes, excellent smoothies, but the best thing it does is chop ice! No more do I pour a glass to have a huge chunk of ice plop in and the drink end up all over the counter. We have had nothing but good luck with this machine."
1,Milkshakes? - not a chance,I use a blender every morning to make a milkshake and after 5 years of using cheap ones which blew up every couple of years I decided to splash out and buy an expensive one. Mistake - this always leaves lumps of friut and ice at the bottom. I've had it for 10 days and it is yet to make a 'good' lumpless milkshake. I'm returning it and would not recommend it if you are buying a blender for making milkshakes with ice/fruit ( which doesn't leave much! )
1,broke twice and can't get replacement parts,don't waste your money on this blender. I have had it a couple of years and it broke two times. First the blade broke. Kitchenaid no longer made the blade so we had to spend $35.00 on a whole new jar assembly. Than about a year later the black coupler with the 6 little teeth that spin the blades began to break off until they were all completely gone. now we are left with a bottom unit that works but can not spin the blades and a new jar assembly that we wasted money on.. Ok so we call Kitchenaid again and they do not make this part either!! Also we were told you need to buy a special tool to fix the blender and what do you know? they don't sell that either!!!! I think this blender has some serious design flaws and would strongly advise people to think hard before you waste any money on this blender!! We will be buying a new Wering blender!!!
3,decent for starting point,"Book was fairly informative since I got it purely for facts about the cities (not time dependent things such as tax rates and job oppertunities). My major problem with it is that since I had a relatively limited amount of areas I wished to live (east coast), the book produced a relatively limited amount of options and data. It was a good place to start, and gave decent information on the relocating process, but if you know in general where you want to live find a more recent and focused book."
4,Fruit and vegetables look realistic,Bright and colorful and came in a well constructed shopping basket. I bought it for my two year old granddaughter who received a play kitchen for Christmas.
4,Compliments the toy kitchen...,"My grandson enjoys his toy kitchen and his shopping cart - this is a fun addition so he can 'shop' like Mom and have food for the refrigerator and pantry. Pieces are large, colorful and well made. Other than the dog trying to slink off with the head of lettuce it is a great addition."
5,Can't do better,LOVE these. They are darling and durable and provide tons of fun in the toy kitchen. The basket is great for clean up time too!
4,Soul Surfer a good easy read for early teens,"My daughter needed a book for her school's summer reading project. She picked this book off the list because she'd heard about the author who had her arm bitten off by a shark as an 11 year old, surfing. She was able to get through it quickly and she enjoyed it even though she is not an avid reader."
2,Slow and slides come out terribly,"I should have figured I wouldn't get a great product for such a low price, but I tend to trust HP products.Scanning photos works fine, but the quality of slide and negative scans is terrible. The slide scans were unusable. Also, it took forever for the lamp to warm up, so even if I had just scanned a photo/slide, I would still have to wait up to 2 minutes for the lamp to warm up again so I could make another scan. I'm returning this unit and looking for another."
2,Check system compatibility FIRST,"I chose HP 3970 assuming it was good quality for the price, and that it would be easy to use with my HP Pavilion PC. It is a nice scanner, although a little slow, + does a decent job scanning, BUT the drivers/software is incompatible with a large number of systems. I learned this too late (after my 30 day return period), for i had only done test scans of photos and transparent materials, and a RESTART of my pc, not a cold boot. My pc will not cold boot with the scanner software installed, as there is a conflict with the NVIDIA video chipset which came with the HP pc. So, now i have a new scanner i cannot use without great pains. The next shopper should be forewarned to go to www.hp.com and search for the 3970's known incompatibilities BEFORE spending money. Good luck! :)"
2,Scanjet 3970,"After 2+ hours with a technician on the phone, we have concluded that it will not work on my PC for an unknown reason. Probably an incompatibility issue. My Pc is a Dell and operating system is Windows ME. The scanner hardware seems to work fine and the software seems to be working, but together they are not working. It is being returned ASAP. I like HP products, but this one is not working. Beware."
4,I'm happy with it,"I just got it yesterday and so far I'm very pleased.I wanted something that would scan slides as well as prints and this scanner does both very well. Yes, it's a little slow, (okay, a lot slow) but for $100 I didn't expect anything else. (I use a larger and more expensive HP scanner at work, and that one is even slower and noisier.)I don't use the scanner software, I scan directly into photoshop and that works seemlessly. Colors look great, image looks great and I can tweak it however I want. That's all I was looking for.Bottom line: if you have a lot of slides to scan on a regular basis and more money to spend, you'd probably be happier with another scanner. But for someone who scans a few things at a time and is looking for something inexpensive and easy to use, I think you'd be happy with this one."
1,Awful,"As a fan of Alt History, I am used to the bizarre, but this book was too much. God, the black hole, loves dogs who fight bulls and England needs to rule the world but needs dogs in order to dominate the globe. WTF? I couldn't get past to page 50."
1,Its a Dog Allright,One thing came to mind while reading this book. There are some people that high school english teachers shouldn't encourage.That said I was intigued enough by the premiss to buy this book and I have to say the best written part was the synopsis at Amazon. Bad. Not putrid bad. But NOT very well written. I returned it and the other two in the trilogy.
5,The Best Jazz Duet!!,Ella and Louis back together to sing Gershwin. This cd is teh best of the best.
2,Memories,"I remember when ""Let it Whip"" was a hit. Even though it is a good song, I didn't find much else on the CD that I liked; therefore, 2 stars is all I'm able to give it."
5,Saving Europe,"Cervantes is remembered as the author of ""Don Quixote"" and the father of the novel. The accomplishment of which he was most proud was his service at the Battle of Lepanto. He felt, as do many historians, that the battle saved Europe from conquest by the Turks. The battle may not have been quite as decisive as all that, but European history would have been quite different had the Spanish lost.This book gives a readable account of this turning point in history, as well as a rousing account of, not only the battle itself, but the Seige of Malta, which served as a prelude to the battle.That Lepanto was the high water mark of Spanish naval accomplishment is all the more remarkable in that it preceded by only a few years the debacle of the Invincible Armada."
2,"Racist, do not make deliveries to PR","They accept the payment, but never sent the Item.Now I have to cancel after three weeks of waiting.unbelievable but true, do not send e-mail to keep you informed."
4,Whimsical delight!,"I don't have kids and I loved this book! Wonderfully whimsical view of what snowmen do ""off duty"" from a very creative mind. The colorful illustrations of cavorting snowmen make me laugh every time."
1,Trees died in vain,"It is unfortunate that the rating scale only allows a positive numbers of stars. This book easily rates a negative 5 star rating. Fowler does not realize the difference between wit and stupidity. ""Scepticism, Inc."" aims for Vonnegut-like whimsey but achieves something far, far less."
3,"Flawed, although probably the best.","My primary gripe is that the prompts in English are inconsistent and unnecessarily backwards, grammatically. For example, the announcer gives the following prompt in English; ""The coffee of that coffee shop is delicious"". Not only is that sentence grammatically awkward, it doesn't match the grammar of the correct translation in Japanese. The correct response in Japanese is simply, ""That coffee shop's coffee is delicious"". There is no reason why the prompt cannot match this. I really wish Pimsleur cleaned up these inconsistencies for a more productive and less frustrating learning experience."
4,High Quality Bag,"This is a high quality bag made of dense material. The padding is adequate for car travel, but this is not the protection that a traveling musician would want. The bag is about six inches longer than my Casio keyboard needs, but the extra space comes in handy for the adapter and pedal. On the downside, the outside pockets are skimpy and I do not trust the shoulder strap to hold the instrument. I think it is a good deal for the $35 price."
5,So far so good,"This item was unavailable for a very long time. I was very excited when it came in stock and ordered it immediately. Of course it's not $15 anymore, but it came really fast and fit perfectly. I was impressed with the bag in the house. We haven't yet had to take the keyboard out of the house and so can't comment on durability.2011 Update: We have since taken the keyboard out and about several times. This bag has held up nicely and protects the keyboard very well! I have upgraded from 4 to 5 stars as I now feel the bag has justified the price I paid many times over."
5,Great gift for my musician wife,This cas was great for her needs as she lugged around her keyboard to voice lessons or her theatre rehearsals. Her only gripe was that she wishes it was a little longer so her stand woudl fit all the way in it. Overall this was a big hit as it is does a great job allowing her to carry it and offers a good level of protection.
5,"Facts, intrigue, inspiration","A great story - even better since its true. Perfect for students, entrepreneurs and web surfers.Other books that come along later will be jaded by knowing too much. Only this book can tell it how it happened, since it was written at the same time; giving the reader a real-time perspective, not revisionist.Reid gives his book the same kind of drive and intensity that the early web architects must have had!"
5,a friend,One of the victims in this sensless act was a very dear friend of mine...the book does not really allow the reader to get to know her...Raylene...someone who was very full of life...the kind of friend you could confide in and count on when you needed her...I'll miss her forever.
3,poor handgrip,"I regret that I did not test this pump within the first 30 days, because I would have returned it. It actually has only one drawback in my opinion, but that one thing makes it stressful on the fingers.On the plus side it is well-made, having a smoothe stroke with no slop. Pumping on both the push and pull strokes is a key feature that works well. The mounting bracket is basic, but with a nice built-in cover for the pump nozzleThe one flaw is in the handgrip at the nozzle end - it's simply too short. It can be gripped only by the thumb and fingers I found that just a slightly better grip can be obtained by putting that hand on the other side of the wheel.Unless size is a priority, my recommendation is to look for a pump that has a longer stroke and longer grips."
1,A complete waste of money!,"Do yourself a favour and DO NOT buy this gadget. It might repell mice, but it also repells everything else, including people. The ""ultrasonic"" sounds are, in reality, a loud screeching noise that is impossible to tolerate or even stay in the same room with. Only the insects seem to love them. Buy an insect repellent, and as for scaring away mice, get yourself a nice cat - and you are sure to do much better than by aquiring this useless trinket!"
1,A waste of your money,"This book is most useful if you are only looking to translate Spanish to English (about 225 pages). But do not get this book if you need English to Spanish translations (about 70 pages). This section is very limited. And I mean VERY limited. Most of the legal terms, even the most basic ones, weren't there, and I did find them in my regular English/Spanish dictionary.I wish I had read the review from St. George before purchasing it. But I got this book a while ago, and after repeated, frustraing times looking up words I decided to go ahead and write a review."
2,Depends on your expectations,"Arkad relates that he did as advised, saving a tenth of his income for a year, then investing that money in a book written almost a hundred years ago. He related this to Algamish, who castigated Arkad for this foolishness. ""Every fool must learn,"" he said.Collected from a series of informational pamphlets distributed in 1926. That is all it is, the text is written as if it were some ancient wisdom and there are a few interesting points there but will it really help you to become the richest man anywhere. No. Not really.So if you want to enjoy a few hours reading a few old pamphlets collected togeather and passed on as ancient wisdom. Go ahead. But if you are struggling financialy your salvation isn't here and Algamish will castigate you for spending your modest disposable income on this book."
3,"GOOD ADVICE, BUT PRIMARILY OLD-FASHIONED COMMON SENSE!","To the book's credit, it was worth reading; much of the content was based around good, old-fashioned common sense - hard work, investing, spending wisely and saving for the future. Great advice, but nothing unique that will set the world on fire either. I had hoped the book would depart some deeper knowledge, something that would be so enlightening to the reader one could say,""Ah, now I have learned a signigicant lesson, something of value."" Alas, that did not happen.The major drawback to the book was simply its length - far to short. The book is extremely elementary and if that is what you are looking for this is it. However, if you are searching for a book with more a deeper meaning, one that can be used as a learning tool particularly in teaching teens the value of a dollar, I highly recommend, ""Capitate Your Kids: Teaching Your Teens Financial Indepndence"" by Dr. John E. Whitecomb (a five star plus!)"
4,Solid advice,"Its a nice short read, only about 100 pages or so. Solid financial advice, nothing ground breaking but very basic and seems to be a good starting point. A little repetitive though."
2,Reduce to 2 pages and I'm in!,"I'll sum this book up for you in one sentence, ""put 10% of everything you make in savings and then make your money earn you more money that doesn't require additional effort from you."" The rest of the book just repeats this moto. The book does supply a fun story about Babylon, but if you are strictly interested in financial advice, the book doesn't go beyond the basics of saving. A good read for most Americans who have been entranced by credit card companies and over look the piggy bank, but for the financially responsible, I wouldn't recommend unless you want a good story about Babylon."
3,Not for the sophisticated,"Given how many fans this book appears to have, I feel a little lonely noting anything negative about it, but it was so simplistic I couldn't stick with it to the end. The advice in The Richest Man..., is fine enough, but I found the ""thous and thys"" annoying and mostly common sense. A MUCH better bet is The Mindful Money Guide. This book simplifies financial advice and never forgets there's more to life than the bottom-line (without losing sight of the importance of financial security). It can also be enjoyed by someone with hip or mildly hip sensibilities. It's well-written and made me laugh out loud a few times."
3,Decent,"If you have no idea what to do with your money and enjoy childish fables, this book is for you. Has some very basic, common-sense lessons in the story. Otherwise, save your money and instead use it to invest."
5,A Must Read!,"The principals discussed in this book are the foundation for financial freedom and success. It may seem difficult at first to implement the principals, but after putting them into place... Your peace of mind is pay back enough!"
2,wasted time on reading the book,I would not recommend to buy this book. It does not give any knowledge in the area of investment or creating wealth.
4,Sometimes we just need a reminder...,...of the blindingly obvious. Amidst the complexities of adult life it can be hard to see the wood for the trees and get a grip on your attitudes to money and financial planning. Clason uses his faux-Biblical parables to set down some very simple guidelines for financial health. 'The Seven Cures for a Lean Purse' are worth the entry fee alone. Spend less than you earn. I'll be using this with kids that I teach and if I'm really brave I will get a grip on the bank accounts. Well worth a read.
5,Classic book and financial lessons,"This is a classic book with classic financial lessons. Nothing fancy, no focus groups or statistics, just basic common sense. Okay, a little more than just common sense or it wouldn't be worth reading.A great book for young people and great refresher for the more experienced."
4,Most of the content is good for even today,"Most of the content in this book is good even for today. One thing that in my opinion may not work all the time is to take advice from professional money managers, which might be okay in many cases but usually that would mean investing in an actively-managed mutual fund via retirement plans and such, which don't have that great of a record when it comes to rates of return because of costs eating into the returns.This book presents the principles of money management via common personal development mechanisms such as 1. Avoid procrastination 2. Assess risk before jumping into a situation etc."
2,for those who have little to no knowledge about money,"This isn't a bad book, but for someone who have very little knowledge about money. The best aspect about this book is the actual story or the setting of the book. That part is pretty interesting and fun, but in terms of getting something out of this I'd choose another book unless you have very little know-how about money"
2,Gaps in the writing,Just seems like a cut and paste version. Disappointed . What is with the gaps not sure it was originally written this way
5,A must read little book for personal finance inspiration,"A must read! It only takes but a few hours to read. Onething, you can not be annoyed by language like ""thee"". Itis a great inspirational book on personal finance and investing. I have recommended it to all my good friends. Enjoy it!!"
5,Great book,"Simple, short and consisce. This books gives advice on how to never be broke. This book is validfrom the times of Babylon to our present and in any nation or culture."
4,Some good advice,The CD version of this book makes read alot easier with today's busy schedules. There are a lot of good common sense ideas offered with this book.
5,Timeless Classic,"Having been written in 1926 and not updated since, you'd think this book was more than a little dated. Not so. The advice given is timeless. Simple enough for even kids to understand yet profound enough that it should be mandatory reading for every adult."
5,Must read for all ages,This is an financial book written as a story to reinforce specific attitudes to become wealthy.
3,Great book to read - poor binding,"This is a classic, must read for anyone that ones to be successful. However, the book itself came apart at the seams about a week after I bought it. Must have been poorly glued."
4,Inspiration for the financially challenged.,"This book can be a guide to get people out of debt and on the road to success. It is not a get rich quick scheme, but sound advice that people should understand before graduating high school, and certainly before ever getting a credit card.For minimal time and money investment, this book has a wealth of information."
4,pink tea kettle,Very durable but I wish it had a whistle to signal when the water is ready in case you are not stand right next to the stove...
4,calypso,"basic kettle, just nice for a 2 person home. only qualm- it doesn't whistle. but you get what you pay for!"
3,Not the greatest,"I'm no connoisseur of teapots, but I was hoping to get something slightly better for $14.99. It looks good enough, but the quality is not the best. At some point early on, the lid dented, so it's been difficult to close ever since. I'm not even sure how/when this happened, but I guess it didn't take much. Now the screw in that lid is starting to rust. Again, I'm not an expert, but I did expect a little more. Otherwise, it does its job boiling water, so I can't complain too much."
2,What is up with this color??,The orange tea kettle I ordered was supposed to be a nice pleasant orange. The orange tea kettle I received today is NOT the same orange. It's the most obnoxious red orange I've ever seen. I'm sending it back.
2,watch your kettle!!,"So without the whistle, as many have noted, this product can be a bit dangerous, however what i did not expect was the handle melting after being against the side of the kettle for less than ten minutes!!UGLY smelly (like burnt plastic) results.It goes on top of the stove, the handle should be more heat proof."
5,There is nothing to complain about,"its great, the price is right, the size is good and the color is beautiful.It is the perfect teapot for every day use."
4,kettle,this is great I put water in it. put it on the stove and it holds it while it gets all hot for soups or tea or coffee or just hot water. should of bought a bigger one but that was my bad.
2,Paint problems,"I bought this teapot in yellow and it looks great in the kitchen. The problem is that the first time I heated water in it the paint started to chip off (yes, there was water in it) and since then I constantly find more flakes of paint on my stove top even though I am not even using it. Looks great but not durable at all."
5,Love!,"I love my new little teapot! The yellow color isn't quite pastel and not quite bright, but the style is so darn cute. The handle and lid get a little hot if the water boils, but this isn't a big deal to me. I'm so glad I bought this."
1,Don't Bother,"This game was awful. I bought, thinking it would be like the movie, but it wasn't. It wasn't worth the money. You just jump around, hitting the other player. Buy Zelda or Mario instead."
1,Shrek: Fairy Tale Freakdown,A primative run-of-the-mill punch and kicker. Schlock version of Mortal Combat designed to capitalize on a fun film. Not at all engaging and not very responsive to the hand controls.
3,Not sold on the whole system,"The hook itself is well made and very sturdy. The rail you put it on is only so-so. I have the bike hook as well and the weight of the bike causes the rail to bend. You're better off just using the hooks and not wasting your time on the rail system. And if you are not using the rails, there are cheaper options. The hook is nice with the rubber padding and the lip to prevent the ladder from falling off."
4,Great for iMac,"iMacs have their USB ports in the rear. This brings everything froward in a clean, efficient package. Inobtrusive yet very visible activity indicators. Like it."
5,"Practical, simple, seamless",Plug and play: What more could you want? This is an excellent bargain for a powered hub that includes the power supply. Windows 7 instantly recognized. No issues whatsoever.
4,the chinese cocteau,"I have been a huge fan of the cocteau twins since the beginning. I thought i owned just about everything they had out. When they broke up i started following robin guthries career, his solo work is like an instrumental cocteau twins. I had recently found out they had collaberated with faye wong, (she is huge in china!) She is probably the only singer that can mimic elizabeth frasers lovely voice. THis import cd is very pricey, but if you are a huge cocteau fan, its a must. THe cocteau twins only produce two tracks on this album. One track is an original and the other is a remake of a cocteau b-side. She sings in manderin, which few will understand what she is singing. But for true cocteau fans, that doesnt matter because elizabeth fraser sings in her own language, that few people understand. The rest of the album has a big cocteau feel and is pretty good to. Go ahead and give her a try."
3,surprisingly entertaining,"Considering the fact that this DVD might be severely cut, this movie is quite frankly very englightening. It is basically a road movie, but actually a metaphor for free love. 2 young men, on a journey through france, commiting hit-and-run crimes (mostly just stealing cars) and having sex with women of all ages. That's the impression what you could get from it.But below the surface this is a very thoughful, well-told film of typical french style."
5,SOFT,"I love this little alpaca, it's so soft. He stands up, too. He'll just be standing there looking at you like ""Hey, whatcha doing?"""
3,Disappointed,This battery life is not much better than the standard PA3451U-1BRS. I get max 1.5 hrs. vs. approx. 3 hr. specification. My PC power settings are minimized. The standard PA3451U-1BRS gives me approx. 1 hr. with the same PC settings.
1,smoking blender!,"i bought this blender because it seemed well built and had a motor rated almost 500 watts. Nevertheless, the third time i used the blender to mix pumpkin pie ingredients on ""stir"" the motor started smoking and the unit became very hot. This unit is not very reliable. If you buy it, be sure to fill out your warranty card."
4,"Again, not just for Children","My review for Pratchett's ""A Hat Full of Sky"" reads almost exactly like that for Pratchett's ""Wee Free Men"" (the prequel to this book). First, and most importantly, I don't care what the ""official"" write-ups for this book say: this is not just a book for pre-pubescent youth. Outside of the fact that the protagonist is an 11-year old and some of the behavior/situations are somewhat simplified (i.e., it doesn't have the layers and layers of meaning buried in Pratchett's other works), this is standard Discworld fare. Some mild complaints are that the book appears to finish up just after the middle. However, that was a faulty assumption on my part and I quickly saw what Pratchett intended. Also, Granny Weatherwax isn't quite in character: she's too warm. I've marked the book down from five stars to four because of the mild simplification, but other than that, it's pretty darn good."
4,Almost As Good,"This sequel to The Wee Free Men was good but not as good as its prequel.This is a story to tell what happens to Tiffany and the Nacmacfeegle after Tiffany throws the Queen of the fairies out of her world.As she studies to become a witch in the mountains an evil creature that cannot be killed tries to take over her mind and body making her do dreadful things, including finding out what happens to the rest person when you turn them into a frog. Luckily the Nacmacfeegle have a plan, or rather a PLN to save her. Tiffany's mind and soul slowly start turning into the evil inside her. Still, Tiffany does not let the evil take her without a fight. In her mind she hides, trying not to let the evil take all of her and make her the most feared and hated being on the earth. You should read the book and find out what then happens to Tiffany and the Wee Free Men. Sadly, I thought this book, unlike its prequel, had an unsatisfying ending and that is why I only gave it four stars."
4,What makes a real witch?,"Tiffany Aching, heroine of 'The Wee Free Men' leaves home and goes be apprentice to the witch Miss Level, who has a very unusual talent. Tiffany is rather bored by the mundane duties required of her by Miss Level, and meets some other, flashier witches who seem to have a different idea of what witchcraft is about, but who is right? Meanwhile a mysterious and apparently maligant force is after Tiffany, attracted by her strong magical powers. The valiant and belligerent little Nac Mac Feegle set out to rescue her, and Granny Weatherwax too has an interest in Tiffany. I enjoyed this book more than 'The Wee Free Men' I thought it was funnier and had a more intersting plot, with a number of unexpected twists. Great fun, full of humour, magic,suspense and amusing characters."
5,Great cookbook for adults as well as kids,"I got this for my daughter, and - though she likes it, too - I make the recipes from it more than she does! The tofu with peanut sauce is delicious and my kids ask for it often. She loves making the tea biscuits. Some of the recipes are less interesting than others, but that's to be expected, as the book is catering to a wide variety of tastes. It's easy to follow, and the recipes are truly creative. I have relatives with all kinds of food restrictions, and this book has come in very handy. Not too simple or bland for adult tastes, but not hard for kids."
3,"A good Yates book, but not for children (as were most of hers)","As most Elizabeth Yates books were written for a youthful audience, please note that this book has a more mature topic. It is the story of a young woman, very discouraged with life, who decides to ingest rat poison. This brings about a slow demise, but during that time she gains a new view on life, and realizes how precious it is. So, overall, this is actually an encouraging and touching book, though still with great sadness (I won't tell you how it ends). Given the topic of suicide, though, it is not the Yates book you want to hand to even your older children without forethought. I do believe it was fully intended for an adult audience."
2,too little,"The Comendium contains introducing desciptions of Hunter's antagonists. It's not bad but definitely too little for an own book, even a compendium. It should rather be a chapter in a bigger publication. If you have knowledge about Vampire, Werewolf or Mage you don't need it."
2,What was country about the majority of the stories????,"A book full of heartwarming stories from country stars, singers, writers, and listeners, or so the back of the book said. As I read some sentimental stories, and some down right boring stories I questioned how more than half of these stories got into the `Country1 edition of the Chicken Soup series. I loved about three stories, liked about ten, and was puzzled by all the other entries."
5,Geat for young kids not looking for dino detail,"My nearly 3 year old daughter loves this book. Very little text, wonderful full page, colorful illustrations. Won't do for a dino-freak who is interested in habitat, diet, etc. The little text that there is is humorous and comparative, ""dinosaur weak, dinosaur strong."" Great early reader and frequently requested at my house. I think the age range at 4+ is off, should be for 2-4 in my opinion."
3,"Writing/Illustration Excellent, Physical construction poor","We bought Dinosaur Roar! for our kids becuase it was a favorite from the library. The illustrations and concepts are excellent, but this version that I ordered from Amazon is poorly constructed. I wouldn't call it a board book as much as a think card book. The pages were warped when it arrived and the puppet is too small for my 20 lb toddler to get her hand into. I still recommend the book, but see if you can get ahold of a better made older addition. Baring that, definitely pass on the puppet."
3,left me disappointed,This was just ok. Art could have been better. The kids (3 & 5) who love dinosaurs and have a nice collection of books haven't picked up the book since the first time they read it. I prefer the books with more info.So do the kids--even the little one. Money wasted for me. Maybe it's ok for little ones who haven't been in to dinos for some time.
4,Must have book,"The book covers every aspect of TruCluster admin, from planning to running updates. The book was written for TruCluster 5.1A, but is well worth reading for other versions."
2,Contains some charismatic elements,I would just like to caution those who are interested in purchasing this book that it contains events such as people believing they have received messages from God.
1,don't buy,I purchased two of these rails 8 months ago for my two year old son. the second one just broke tonight. Now he is sleepinng in a bed with a rail that might not support him. Terrible design. never had a tight fit against the mattress. the strap makes no sense. doesn't stay tight. there are better rails out there.
4,I wish it was pre-assembled,I ordered this from Amazon.com. My kid is excited about it. The only con I have is that I wish this came pre-assembled. Trying to put this together with two kids vying for my attention was not so pleasant for me. The instructions are kind of vague and at one point I put it together backwards. But it works and is serving its purpose.
5,Just what we were looking for,This is a great bed rail. We just moved our 3 yr old into her bed about a month ago and so far so good. This rail is long enough to cover most of her bed and is very sturdy. No issues for my husband in putting it together either. Overall very pleased!
4,extra long bed rails,"The rails are very long but, that is a good thing. They slide, with a little effort, between the mattress and the box springs. As rails go, these are very good in keeping my grand children from falling out of the bed."
5,Job well done,"This really works well. I have no worries about my little girl (2 years old). She has no way of falling out of her new twin bed. The assembly was tougher than suggested. Overall- we really needed a good, safe product that works. My little girl really puts this product to the test as she sleeps. Pretty wild sleeper."
4,I Highly Recommend It,"If your preference is for the typical senseless, gory, slasher movie, then you will be disappointed.Kaidan is a love story that turns into a ghost story. Very picturesqe and quality throughout."
1,This book made me break my own reading laws...,"I thought, ""Hey, I'll give R.L.Stine a chance... Millions of kids reading his stuff couldn't be wrong, could they?""They aren't wrong. Just young.I am an avid reader, and have never skipped ahead to read the ending. It's against my moral code. When I read this book, my wife would ask me why I had such an unpleasant look on my face. I responded that the book was terrible. She asked why I didn't put it down. I told her that I needed to know how it ended. She said skip to the back and look. Against my reading ethics, I did. The end was so predictable I (thankfully) had no need to read the rest.If you are one of the unfortunate souls who is currently reading this book, do what I did. Then find a book that won't waste your time."
2,:),"I find it insanely funny that Sara thinks to herself (about the rejected manuscripts) 'Don't these people know how bad their writing is?' I could ask the same of Stine regarding this book. It's not completely bad, seeing how I enjoy the character of Liam, but I see him as Naveen Andrews who is definitely not Irish....Why all the cursing and sex? Is there really a reason for it, other than wanting the book to sound adult? Was this thing edited at all?Anyway, I hope R.L. Stine sticks to his yound adult/pre-teen stories, they are a LOT better, IMO."
2,"Was o.k., but lacked something...an original plot maybe??","I read Stine all the time--his books are a quick read and don't use up too many brain cells. This being an adult novel I thought it would be a little more mature than his others. Nope. I read it all the way to the end and thought, ""He must pick plots out of a hat."" Not too impressive, and SO formula!! I'll keep on reading his books when I get bored, I just think he needs to stick with writing the kiddie books..."
1,Eeeeeeeeeewwwwwwwwwwwwwwww,I actually rate this book with no star at all but the system said I made a mistake by not rating it. My mistake was in reading this garbage. Gross! Horrible! I cannot rate this book low enough. Do not waste your money or your time. I am so sorry that I wasted mine.
3,Beastmaster,It was well packaged and fast delivery. The product was new and cello wrapped. The DVD was a copy of the orginal as it was only on VHS. It was of professional quality. The movie being originaly on VHS; was of a good grade reproduction. For me it was like walking down memory lane on video. Blast from the past kind of thing. Nice DVD to add to my collection.
5,beastmaster,"very fast shipping, it's like brand new but without the shrink wrap. I haven't watched it but im assuming it works theres no scrachs on it."
3,Good cheesy fun,"This is your typical 80's sword and sorcery movie. It's got a beastmaster, a big sword, animals and Tanya Roberts in a fur bikini.Seriously, what else do you need?So turn off the lights, grab some popcorn and prepare to just enjoy the ride."
3,Movie has one part that skips.,"The product arrived quickly. Looked in good condition. When played the dvd, there is one section that pauses and skips over it. Will not play that one section which is about 5-10 minutes of the video skipped. Otherwise the rest of the movie plays fine. Movie is low budget, but we bought it for childhood memories. Watched it when we were kids and wanted to see it again!"
4,A classic that any fan of Anderson or Shakespeare will love,"This is one of those books you want to keep and read again over the years. It's a historical what if? story. What if there was a world where Shakespeare's stories were history rather than fiction and in this world railroads were built 200 years early? It's a wonderful story with all the elements of fantasy of Shakespeare's ""A Midsummer Night's Dream"" combined with the battle between Royalists and Roundheads in a world of premature steam industry. The only thing that would be more wonderful would be if it were twice as long! This is a book you can read today and it is still as great as when it was written."
5,A Great Book . . .,"Well, it's true . . . The Good News: I just spoke with Dr. Walston and he's planning to write an all new 5th edition of this book! We--his audience--have been waiting for this. I guess all the emails and phone calls he got asking for a 5th edition finally got to him! The Bad News: The new book might not be out until sometime in 2007. No matter, the 4th ed is a fine book and it is still highly used and immeasurably useful. I recommend it all the time to folks wanting to know what's what in Distance Learning, especially Christian Distance Learning."
5,Just got it Saturday and finished it Monday,"Let me say that I joined the ranks of those on amazon who wrote a good review about the book. The book was a blessing and a eye opener. I would recommend that any person looking to go to seminary, traditional or non- traditional get this book before making a decision. This book well help.... the only thing that was sad was the fact that I couldn't give more than 5 stars on amazon. Dr Walston keep this book up to date.... God Bless"
5,Perfect Holster Must Have for EVO 4G,"Perfect fit. Screen goes on the inside on a felt surface. Very good quality with easy to insert and release the phone. Unlike other holster, this on is very slim. I had to have before the summer as I'm losing my Jacket pockets."
2,Poorly Made,"The belt clip broke after 3 weeks of use. After contacting the seller,I was sent a replacement (free of charge). This "" Non Defective"" replacement also broke in the same area 2 weeks after I received it. I will not be submitting another complaint due to the fact that the product is poorly made. I would recommend purchasing this item only if you plan on not wearing it on your belt."
4,Not to bad,"This product works as it should, slightly thinner material but so far has held up, you should note that your phone will not fit this if you have the cover on it, this holder only works on your phone without the protective cover that goes around the phone, so it was a bit of an adjustment getting the phone off the catch when it rang ( always had a cover on mine ). I would buy this again if needed."
5,A LOVE SO STRONG & THUGGED OUT,Little Ghetto Girl is for real. . If your looking for a thug love book you can relate to this is the one. . .
2,Not all that,"This book was okay to me. People that aren't used to good books, must have gave this book a rating of 5. It was unrealistic to me. The author focused too much on the name brand clothes, okay we get the point."
5,That was the real !!!,This book kept me reading alnight. The best story since The Coldest Winter Ever.
3,Pretty from the front,"I purchased these earrings to wear on my wedding day, and they are beautiful...from the front. The backs of these reveal how cheap they really are. Unfortunately one of the earrings does not hang completely straight, and keeps tilting to the left, so it shows a bit of the back... which is disappointing. I may try to tighten the hinges to see if I can force it to hang straight...otherwise I will have to return them."
3,He is not a SAINT! And it is not your DAY!!,"Well look what is coming this Oct. PATRICK! I have had to watch my AWFUL vhs copy for years and though in truth this is no masterpiece of HORROR it does have its moments. Patrick begins with poor Patrick electrocuting his mother and lover and being taken to a hospital for the trauma has left him in a coma. But poor Patrick has not just been lying around; quite the contrary, as he's developed a powerful telekinetic ability TO KILL!!! This is a enjoyable blatant rip off of CARRIE and despite the handicap of dubbed in accents(no big deal to lovers of ALL HORROR films)this film builds suspense and SCARES quite well. Gave it only 3 stars for could really have done with out the obligatory CARRIE final jolt ala FRIDAY THE 13TH & just recently THE STRANGERS...Been done to death"
5,The Supremes Reign Supreme,"What I love about this particular Supremes compilation, is that it is a collection of greatest hits, album tracklist fillers, and previously unreleased material.It is not merely another ""greatest hits package"". The buyer actually gets some variety with this album. I highly recommend this album for all Supremes fans. Besides the two 1965 top 5 hits ""I Hear A Symphony"" and ""My World Is Empty Without You"" from the I Hear A Symphony album, you also get their version of the Isley Bros. ""This Old Heart Of Mine (Is Weak For You)""(which actually had originally been intended for the supremes by holland/dozier/holland. Also featured is the previously unreleeased track ""Mr. Blues"" which was recorded by the original trio (Diana, Mary, and Florence) in 1963. These, along with another handful of classic Supremes material, make for a great album. I highly recommend this album to all those Supremes fans and collectors."
1,Terrible!,"This game is awful! Avoid it at all costs. This game started out as a FREE flash animation game on the PC. It was available for free download for years and years. This is a dirty attempt to cash in, and it clearly shows. Although a bowling game is indeed uncommon, it gets repetitive and boring after the first few frames. The animations don't change, the sound doesn't change, nothing changes... it's the same little minigame, over and over. Granted, bowling is technically like that, but it takes more in a video game to make it entertaining. Please, do not spend your money on this.... it's a pathetic excuse for entertainment."
5,Staying organized!,"This is great for all the misc. junk my kids have ... batting gloves, frisbees, jump ropes, etc. Works great! Yep, you need this one, too!"
2,CA Gourmand,"I was not impressed with this purchase. Although it does everything it says it does, cut french fries, it is limited by the space in the feed tube. If you've already got the knife out to par down the potato to fit the tube, you might as well just slice your fries yourself. You will get a longer french fry and no wasted clean up. I prefer a fry that is longer than 3 inches which may even be stretching it for the final resulting fry size that you get out of this blade. As with most Kitchenaid products it is sturdy and will last, which is why I gave this blade a rating of 2. I have used my blade once and do not forsee it ever seeing the light of day again in my house."
1,Most disappointing book I've ever read,"I was looking for a book that discussed the different denominations and the history, beliefs, and style of worship of each one -- a comparison. It is beyond me how a person could run on about denominationalism for 218 pages and not mention how the denomonations are different.A complete waste of TIME."
4,a great little collection,"The Marvelettes, for me, were the greatest of the Motown girl groups. They had a rawer edge to their sound than the others. It is an adolescent thing, too. Hearing Mr Postman again takes me right back to those summers days of the early sixties, there has never bben a sound like it. This CD collection has some rare stuff I have never heard before ~ this is always great; like finding a new chapter in your favourite book. Hearing their version of Message to Michael was great, never heard that before. Thanks, little guys out there for finding these treasures and making them available and at such a cheap deal, way less than a round of drinks. Cheers!!"
4,Marine Air,This is a collection of real adventures in Marine Air. The stories are accurate and instructive. It covers all eras in Marine Air History.
3,So So,"I felt like the price for just a few small samples in baggies was kind of high (especially with shipping), but I had heard a lot about Youngblood makeup and wanted to try it before spending $36 on a foundation I hadn't tried. It gave pretty good coverage, but made me look very shiny. I have oily skin, so I don't need any help in the shine department. I would recommend this for people with skin that is more normal to dry."
4,Elegant combination of post-fusion and sonic textures,"What you'll get on this CD is an elegant, brilliant combination of post-fusion, synth programming, sonic textures and, in certain pieces, pop vocals. Musical intentions like improvisation and interaction typical in mainstream jazz are not the main concern on Immigrants. I have never got tired of listening to this recording and I believe you'll enjoy it too unless you strictly prefer hard-and-heavy fusion material."
4,Another Winner!,"Once again Ms Mason offers believable characters and a heroine who is full of courage and spunk that keeps a Connie Mason fan turning the page. We have Angel, a no good step-father, his accomplice in deception, and Rafe. There are a number of story lines being woven by this mistress of romance, excitement, and suspense so the reader is constantly wondering what's next. If you are looking for a story where the knight does not save the damsel in distress but say a knight and a damsel put together merely by circumstances beyond their control this is your story. Once you've read this story it will merely keep you craving for more Connie Mason."
4,ANOTHER WINNER,"A very good read. I read this book in one night, once I started I could not put it down. Rafe made the perfect hero; a man who was not perfect but always came through to do the right thing."
5,a review by a 14-year-old,"Since most of the reviewers of this book are adults now who read this book as children and are remembering it as a childhood favorite, I would like to say that as a modern 14-year-old, I liked this book too. I agree with the reviewer who gave this book 4 stars because it was ""dated"" - the remark about communists (""human rights and human suffering mean nothing to a communist"") - did make it quite clear what time period the book was written in, and the Christianity parts - Father O'Day ""ranting"" about his ""sworn enemy"", the devil - were kind of annoying, but that didn't spoil the book for me - i still loved it."
2,A great disappointment of a sequel.,"Escape to Witch Mountain was a great book, made into a fun kid's movie. Then a sequel to the movie was made, and as far as I can tell, this book is merely the literal translation of that inferior second movie. It is nothing like Key's other books, and is sure to disappoint any fans of his who hope for a real continuation of the Witch Mountain story."
4,Better than you might expect,"I understand one's reluctance to pick up paperbacks that look like novelizations of so-so Disney movies. (Can you say ""The Computer Wore Tennis Shoes"" or ""The Shaggy D.A.""?) Well, this was written first, it is not Disneyfied, and it is a lot better than you might expect. It is certainly dated, but not to the extent that it is hard to follow or filled with careless inappropriate characterizations. The characters are well conceived and their circumstances are revealed slowly and with a satisfying sense of mystery. The escapes and chases are taut and plausible. As a consequence this book really does work as an adventure/mystery, without any of the magic angles that inform so much current youth fiction. So, this certainly qualifies as an overlooked semi-classic, and as such is well recommended"
1,"The bad, the bad, and the ugly","This game is terrible. I am not complaining about gameplay-it is terrible because I can NOT play it. First, the game does not recognize the keys of a USB gamepad. The pitching and hitting keys that work are different than showed in the documentation. Even when I figured out they keys, you are limited to simply throwing one pitch and swinging away. I can not believe 3DO could release a game and not test it with a USB port!! This makes the game unplayable. Second, Home Run Derby crashes in the middle and brings you back to your desktop. I could sit and list the problems I had once I FINALLY got a game going but I can summarize by saying-this is the worst game ever put out for the pc. This is not just a bad game, it is an unplayable bad game and my money has been wasted. I am so dissappointed because I finally upgraded my hardware enough to play the game people have raved about and it turns out to be junk."
2,Disappointed,"I purchased the Microsoft game pad to go with this game, but it doesn't let me pick off a guy at first or second. Also, I followed the directions on the gamepad for pitching but the computer team continually clobbers my pitching. My pitches seem to all come in at the same speed and the same location no matter what I do and I'm usually losing, 10-3 in the third inning. One hit after another, one game after another. Not very realistic. Definitely tilted unequally towards the computer.Would not recommend this game unless it levels the playing field. Have gone back to my High Heat Baseball 2002."
1,A note on reviews...,"Is it just me, or do these five-star reviews for games that nobody has even seen yet sound like PR pieces that 3DO is putting out, trying to get us to buy their game? HH2002 was a good game, no doubt...but a great game? Hardly. Looking at the 3DO website it doesn't sound as if there is that much really new with this version. So be cautious about these reviews."
3,Difficult to Install,"The quality of this light is just ok, looks a bit cheap. That's not the bad part though, this light is extremely difficult to install. I trend the day I have to change the bulb."
4,depressathon ally,"this book is good, the story line is very developed but the book is very depressing. alot of characters where put in just to be killed. other than that its OK"
2,Not worth reading.,"This is probably one of the most boring books that I have ever read. I found this book fairly hard to follow at the start but, as it went on it got a little easier to understand. I, as an American citizen, was offended by the anti-war views that he had expressed in this book. Dalton Trumbo is a very good writer, but I didn't agree with some of his views that he expressed in this book. I think that a good American citizen should be willing to put his or her life on the line for our countries saftey if it is needed."
2,Not much going on to keep me interested.,"For our Senior English class, we read the book ""Johnny Got His Gun"" as an assignment. In my personal opinion, the book was not very interesting to read. When the book started out, there wasn't a whole lot going on and that turned me away from liking the rest of the book. The author had an interesting idea to write a book from the views of a wounded soldier who lost his whole body except for his chest and half of his head, but there just weren't too many interesting events going on. Joe really irritated me, too, because it seemed like he was not proud at all to have fought for his country in the war and that he was the only soldier who had to suffer after being wounded. This is not a book that I would recommend to many people who like books with action in them."
5,The most touching book I have ever read,"I have never read a book that has ever moved and affected me so much. Thank you, Mr. Trumbo, for adding a piece of culture to my life that would have been missing had I not read your sophisticated, touching book."
4,Johnny Got His Gun sends strong message.,"Dalton Trumbo's aniti-war novel Johnny Got His Gun is a fictional story that takes place during World War I. By this war and fighting for his country he ends up with no legs, arms, his face is in shambles; he is without a nose, mouth, eyes and ears. The main character in the book Joe Boeham has no form of communication with the outside world therefore; he is left fighting with his own thoughts. Until a nurse shows him that she undertands him by the use of morse Code. Towards the end of the book when the doctors realize that this man can communicate it gets a little frustrating. Joe, ends the book by letting you hang on contemplating the reasons of what just happened. In conclusion I feel this book was a good book to read and would suggest it anyone who wnats to read a ""DIFFERENT"" book."
2,SO/SO,"I feel that I would have liked this book if the style of writing would have been different. This book showed the real horors of war. I do not agree with the anti-war theme. War will never be shot out of the big picture. If I would have to fight, it would be easier if I was old enough to know the true meaning of ""war""."
1,shameful propaganda,"The author, Dalton Trumbo, was a supporter of communism and the Soviet Union and wrote this book to keep the U.S. out of WWII when Hitler and Stalin were still on the same side. As soon as Hitler turned on Stalin, Trumbo pulled the book from print and became a strong advocate for U.S. involvement in the war. When several isolationists and pacifists contacted him for support a year after the book was published, he turned them in to the FBI.He only rediscovered his pacifist beliefs and republished the book in 1971 because the U.S. was again threatening communist expansion (in Vietnam).The moral of the book is that no ideal (mainly freedom) is worth dying for. This is a flawed argument for pacifism as many pacifists have died for their beliefs (Ghandi, Martin Luther King). For a better book about pacifism, read Ghandi's autobiography. While Johnny Got His Gun is interesting for it's 1930's language, the book's version of pacifism is nothing but dishonest, shameful propaganda."
4,Johnny Got His Gun,"I personally liked the book, but I wish it didn't have a cliffhanger ending. I don't like cliffhanger ending, because I want to find out what happens next. Just my two cents, and Happy New year."
2,First half of the book was boring.,"What can a man do without legs, arms, eyes, a nose and a mouth? In the Book, ""Johnny Got His Gun,"" by Dalton Trumbo, Joe was a man who had survived the war. While laying in the hospital, (he didn't know where he was) he noticed that he had no arms, legs, etc. One thing he later noticed that he did have was the sense of touch. The first half of the book was about his memories of family and friends. The second half of the book got more interesting, because he found out he can use his final sense as a way of communicating. I HAD to know if they understand what he was doing, and if they thought he was crazy or not. The ending of the book was totally different from the way I thought it would end. So, I guess, in a way, this book was a good one, if you like books about the outcome of what a war can do."
1,Too bad for the good parts,"This story about Butch Karp and his wife Marlene and their brood, is a complete and total mess. What was a good story about NYC politics and back room dealings, that are based on a brutal rape, was a good premise. Then we have to have all of these subplots, including a Native American characters ""dream"" about a terrorist plot with a dirty bomby in Time Square. A visit to ""underworld"", as a tribute to HG Wells, and I wonder how drunk the author was when he wrote parts of this. I listened to the audio CD and Lee Sellars performance is very good, despite the subject matter. The fact that he takes this ridiculous story into a tease for the next book, makes me want to puke. Completely improbable situations compounded one upon another."
1,think again before you buy it,"My wife bought this watch in Feb 2003. I liked it at the first sight. However, the alarm kept ringing till the battery was running out. And then I opened te case and changed it. The inside looked pretty bad. Moreover, the alarm doesn't work anymore and the casin g is easy to peel off . The last thing I want to mention is that the warranty is only 90 days. (I guess there will be something wrong in you watch after that time).BTW, I came from China. ""Made in China"" doesn't tell the product is good or nottell you much. We can make good stuff."
3,This toaster toasts like no other toaster has toasted before,"If you're in the market for a one hundred dollar green toaster, the KitchenAid KTT261 Ultra Power Plus is by far the best choice you could make."
3,Marc Dorsey - Crave,"When I first heard Marc Dorsey remake ""People Make the World Go Round"" in 1994, I thought that he was so smooth. He made a comeback in 1999 with this debut album and I was slightly disappointed. I thought that Dorsey would deliver songs as mature as the aforementioned one and take it to some old-school soul level like Eric Benet or Rahsaan Patterson. Instead, he gave us those hip-hop/R&B-type numbers, sounding like another Ginuwine or Jesse Powell (not that those artists are bad, it's just that I thought he would be representing another genre). And there were one too many remakes, especially ""As We Lay"": what was that about?! He should have left that song alone. But there are some highlights like the title track and ""In the Ghetto"". This album wasn't promoted at all and I can kinda see why."
1,"I hate it, I hate it, I hate it!","I bought a lot of the attachments for the 11 cup processor. I like the discs, I love the juice extractor (non citrus), but I hate this citrus juicer attachments!You have to attach it to the top, turn it on and then with your hand press the fruit over the extremely fast spinning reamer. The peel off my lemon was shred apart before half of the juice was extracted. And yes, I did hurt my hand!Please go ahead and buy all the other wonderful attachments this company makes, but wait with this one until they have gone back to the drawing board."
3,Depends on what you're juicing,"It's great for larger fruit like oranges or grapefruit. Next to impossible for tiny key limes, since it has a tendency to chew up fingers."
5,Love It!!!,After reading all the negative reviews I had serious doubts about buying this juicer but I did it anyways. I think it's wonderful. I didn't have any of the problems that were stated in other reviews. I simply cut my lemons in half and pulsed the food processor and in no time I had enough juice. I didn't hit the reamer with my fingers at all. Highly recommended!!!
3,"It's Ok for easy jobs, but flimsy for though ones...","If you don't want to bend back every time you want or need to adjust the bike, it's ok.If your bike have tons of accessories and you don't want to turn it upside down because it will ruin your mirror, bike computer, scratch the seat, etc, its ok.If you really need to repair itTopeak PrepStand Elite Bicycle Repair Standand you find a stubborn part, this is not ok.If you need to put strength to uninstall the bottom bracket or put some weight to uninstall the pedal....you wasted $200.00. Better fabricate yourself or buy a bike shop type (professional one) even if cost more. If you really are into bikes, you will recover your investment just in 5 times you avoid going to a bike shop."
2,Very poor reception!,"I purchased this item at the same time I purchased by new aftermarket radio for the 2008 Dodge Avenger. It was an east install but when I plugged the adapter into the back of the radio, the connection was very loose so I figured no big deal, I will just use a piece of tape to make sure it doesnt come undone. When I first turned on the radio, I got good reception but when I tried to check out other stations, ones that are normally crystal clear will not even come up anymore until im around different areas of the city!"
3,Interesting and Insightful but sometimes confusing.....,"I found this book to be generally very interesting as stated earlier. Especially how Dr. Twiggs explained the Tabernacle and how our worship is to represent the various aspects of the tabernacle. However, the book to me did not have one major theme the author tended to switch to other topics and that i thought didn't help the overall impact of the book on my life."
3,Not the pick of the crop,"I am a long time fan of Richard Thompson, and rate him as a superb musician and songwriter. I was inspired to buy this CD based on the consistency of the reviews below, but on hearing the CD I was disappointed. There are no doubt some good tracks on here, but by and large I felt they were outweighed by the average ones. One track in particular, 'The Little Beggar Girl' I found to be distinctly repetitive. In summary make sure to listen to Richard Thompson if you haven't done so before, but I personally don't rate this as his best, and prefer 'Shoot out the lights'"
5,Play it loud and enjoy it,"When I first listened to this, I thought : ""How come I NEVER heard of those two earlier ?"". I mean, not all songs are masterpieces, but four of them certainly are. Withered and died is one of the most moving ballad I've ever heard - Linda's voice sounds very much like heaven to me. Down where the drunkards roll is great too. The Great Valerio is terrifying. The very bleak ""the end of the rainbow"" is one on the only RT vocals from this period that I really like. The song seems to cast a spell on the listener.The little beggar girl & Has he got a friend for me may be the two weak tracks on the record, and still .. they are not bad at all...."
5,BEST NEST,"THIS BOOK WAS BOUGHT FOR ME WHEN I WAS A CHILD. IT IS AN EXCELLENT BOOK FOR CHILDREN AND I CAN REMEMBER TO THIS DAY THE VERSE THAT IS REPEATED IN THE BEST NEST ON MOST OF THE PAGES. ""I LOVE MY HOUSE ,I LOVE MY NEST IN ALL THE WORLD MY NEST IS BEST. I AM NOW 35 AND I AM SO PLEASED I HAVE FOUND THIS BOOK TO BUY ONLINE AS I HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR IT EVERYWHERE SO THAT I CAN READ IT TOO MY KIDS AND I HOPE THEY LIKE IT AS MUCH AS I DID. ANYONE WITH SMALL CHILDREN SHOULD BUY THIS BOOK."
4,A Book for All Expectant Fathers,"I am sure that there are hundreds of how-to books that explain the goings-on of pregnancy. I found one that struck me by surprise. While reading The Best Nest to my four year old I discovered that P.D. Eastman hit the nail on the head when it comes to the touchy topic of pregnancy and mood swings. Thankfully, it looks like Mrs. Bird wasn't ""with bird"" for too long."
4,Lessons in Love!,Eddie Murphy is great. Boomerang is one of the best romantic comedies ever. Robin Givens is breath taking. The scene of Givens in a green bra and panties is marvelous! All in all what comes around goes around in love
3,"Readable, but derivative","""Coyote"" is less a novel than a collection of loosely-connected short to medium-long stories about a group of approximately 100 people who leave Earth to colonize a planet in a star system 46 light years away. Actually, there are two mutually hostile groups, and the planet is really a large moon of a much larger planet, but that's not what makes the book work - or fail, depending on your perspective.Steele's straightforward style makes ""Coyote"" easy to read, but much of the material is plodding and derivative. There are a lot of unlikely (even unbelievable) elements, ranging from the anachronistic right-wing government he describes in the first section to the rather contrived ""surprise ending."" (I see from other listings on Amazon.com that there are several more books in the ""Coyote"" series, but this first one did not make me want to buy or read them.)"
3,"ALAN STEELE as in ""STOLEN""","HUCK FINN meets ""The LEGACY OF HEROT"". Read both of these which are masterpieces and then see why this is not up to the excitement or TERROR or Humor of the originals. He needs a better editor on this one. I know they started out as a string of short stories but he destroys all the mystery by telling what is going to happen in the first paragraph of each chapter or at the end of the preceeding chapter.(I know TWAIN did that, but that was the general style in the 1800's). I'm a great STEELE fan and loved his last two CHRONOs. If you are Steele fan read this otherwise just read Larry Niven's ""LEGACY OF HEROT"" from 1970.ALSO his diagram of the ship is incomplete(He has a key with missing labels on the ship), Also the map sort of gives away alot of the story, It's helpful but reveals too much of the plot.It's probably his second worst book after Jerico It."
3,Down Town cool ok and a good buy.,If you get this then you should also get house party they make a great pair!I have all the expention packs exempt Deluxe Edition but I am going to get Deluxe.Now all that is covered I will begin.This is a great add on it has a lot of new NPC's including the townies who live at downtown and one NPC which I can't tell you its a secret!I think this is cool but its not as good as the other exp (expention packs)But the new objects and new NPC's >and< the new DownTown area are >>>Very cool<<<!
5,The Sims: HOT Date,I think this expansion will be the best yet.I havn't bought the other expansions yet but I'm going to.I've already preordered the Hot Date and I can't wait until I get it!! 0:-)
5,Take Your Sims on a Hot Date Today,"This is the first expansion pack for the Sims that I've gotten, and it's absolutely awesome. It allows you take your shopping, out to eat, and best of all, dating! They can date your other game characters or one of the many townies that float around downtown.It comes with a lot neat little things, i.e. a cuddle couch, and other things that help your Sims to get closer and fall in love. It also comes with 5 new types of characters who can enhance the game or make the game more difficult.The only problem is that it slows down the game a bit sometimes and can end up causing it to crash, but normally, it doesn't do this.The coolness outweighs the badness, so I definitely recommend this for any Sim freak out there!"
1,Won't work on Windows XP,Wish I had paid more attention and saw that it is only for Win 98/ME When so many are going to XP you would thing they would make this run on XP. Boy is my daughter disappointed and I will not go back to Win 98. I have an old computer with 98 on it but it is only 400 Mhz. From what I read it may not play on that very well.
5,Much more fun than the orignal!!!,"When I got the sim's I had so much fun playing it, but I realized that the sims could only stay at home. When I heard about Hot Date I just Had to get it! As soon as I got it I put it on my computer, and ever since my sims have spent all of their time downtown. If you're thinking of getting the orignal get this with it! It gives you more neighbor-hoods, more objects, and more options. And even if you already have the orignal this is still worth getting"
4,The Sims have done it again!,"Before, you could make friends come over to your house, but where could you go? Nowhere! Now, they have made an all new downtown area where you can go and meet your friends that you created and make new friends that are strangers too. I think that this is the best simulation game ever and I can't wait untill the new Sims Vacation comes out, but...The only problem I have found with this, and it's the same with all of the previous Sims games (The Sims, Livin It Up, House Party) and it probably will be for the next (Vacation) is that the sims get tired too quickly. I know if you don't eat for ten hours you would get hungry and if you haven't got to the toilet you would need to but it's really annoying when you're talking to someone and all of a sudden your Sim has an accident, and I think they should make it so they last longer."
4,The Sims - Hot Date,"Hi! I have had the sims for a little over a year. I also have all of the exspansion packs. I like this game a lot. The only thing I dont like about the sims hotdate is that you dont really get alot. Its like that with all of the Sims games, You soon get bored of what you have and you want more. And I paid almost twice as much for the Livin Large, House Party, and the Hot date than I did for the original Sims. But I have to admit, I cant even imagine not having the sims and all the fun I have with the expansion packs."
5,THE SIMS ROCKS,"Oooh.... ""Hot Date"" is such a STEAMY game! There is now a million more ways you can communicate with other Sims. I had such a laugh when I first played it, and I got hooked on it. I regularly play it, I try to play it everyday. Every day is a ""Hot Date"" in Sim land! Excellent!!!!!..."
5,I love this Game!,"This game is really cool! The relationships take a HUGE step! Honestly! If you thought that getting people to marry in regular Sims is hard, DON'T GET THIS! The emotions can drop very quickly and is it just me or do Sims get hungry faster? :) Downtown is really cool, but it drains alot out of your Sims. So that's the bad side.Anyway this game is great! I hope you get it because it makes the Sims much better!"
1,Hot Date has Problems,"This expansion pack has alot of bugs in it yet if you are a true sims fan. Requires organizers etc. to use any fan site downloads. Has caused numerous crashes to the desktop, sims to get stranded downtown and other strange phenomenon. I don't recommend this pack to anyone until Electronic Arts releases a patch that actually fixes the problems they missed in beta testing."
5,Rekindling an old flame,"There's nothing like a little romance to spice up a boring life, and this expansion pack does just that. The area added is substantially larger than the game itself before this expansion. It is true that the downtown area is slow on my pokey 566 MHz Celeron, but not unplayably so, and the addition of stores, shopping, dining, and more makes up for the sluggishness. I had been bored with The Sims and had hardly played it in months, but Hot Date has rekindled my interest and kept it for hours and hours.As for problems with installation, not only did I have none, but it seems to have fixed a problem I had before when trying to exit Livin' Large after playing it in 1024 x 768 (a problem which was not solved by uninstalling and reinstalling or upgrading video drivers). The game runs better now than it used to, for me at least."
5,read all about it,i'v read all about this and the game sounds exciting i have th e original sims and the two expansion packs i am looking forward to this game and don't think ill last until it comes out on the 15th of nov. in this ep you can play footsies and get in a monsterous makeout session. people say the point of this ep is to marry on the night of your first adte but i believe if you take your time it will be more fun i highly recomemd this game and hope you and i will like it when it comes out . oh duh i forgot to mention the main purpose it is to take place in a downtown setting where you can go to the beach a restuarnat park dance club cafe boutiques on the street or many more. there is many more things to be said but i have to go! chow! love yal!
3,Is it gonna work?,"Buying the House Party expansion pack taught me ONE thing;don't mess with EA!!! It simply makes my computer crash..So I'm thinking, well, the Hot Date expansion pack seems to be really good! Nice idea......but who is to guarantee me I won't throw my money away, just like I did with House Party? And it's not a technical problem that makes my computer crash.....it's the CD! I probably won't resist buying Hot Date. Let's just hope curiosity won't kill the cat AGAIN!"
5,I can't wait!,"Hot Date is expansion pack #3 and I'm going nuts waiting for it. Living Large and House Party definately did not disappoint, and I'm sure Maxis isn't going to let us down with this one! So many Sims fans pour their heart out into making extras for everyone to download, but being able to ""leave"" the Sims house and go out on the town is absolutely FANTASTIC! I cannot wait until this expansion pack comes out!"
1,More Like Barbie and Ken,"I should've gving it more than one, but to me it's like playing dollhouse or house. The reacations are tuned up, but some problems are there, A sim if on the Ultra Fast speed hits the bed, he or she will not get up-you have to wake them up. It's not like in the other 3 Sim games, I must agree with 2 star or less people, this game needs to be debugged. The items and such are great the 1st time, but get boring the next. I dislike the Gossip reaction-this should've been left out the game. It's like Barbie and Ken going Sim, though worse. House Party, Sims and Living Large are better, Large has new jobs, maybe if they could add a little more realness into these games, say murder and even fatal illnesses."
5,Awesome CDs,Wow Worship Aqua is an awesome collection of music. It totally got me into the spirit of worshipping our Lord.
4,"Different, but good.","The product looks slightly different now, and has a plastic clip thing that you've gotta break off if you want to use it for a headphone stand, but it still functions in that roll very well."
5,Great Summer Scent!,"I bought this scent at the beginning of the summer, and I was happy I did. It is a minty/citrusy scent. It is an invigorating scent that is sure to pique the interest of any nose. Live Jazz is definitely a perfect scent for the summer."
2,"Read the description, NOT look at the pic","I got the ear gels, was expecting them to all be large because of hearing problem. There was no combo, just the gels. Looks can be decieving is all I can say."
3,Ok only.,I bought these and then sprung for the custom molded ear peices that mold to your own ear. Much better than these.
4,"Good, but there's better","This is a really good product; however, if you're serious about clean teeth, you should get the one that plugs in.Oral-B Vitality Precision Clean Rechargeable Electric ToothbrushBut again, this one is really excellent, especially for travel."
5,Beautiful!,"I love this CD! J.C. has a beautiful voice and he sings with a lot of feeling. He reminds me of Keith Urban.The title song, ""When the Tide Rolls In,"" is musically so fun and catchy that only later did I realize it was a break-up song. It makes my head think but my feet want to dance.In ""The Girl That Broke Joe's Heart"" he sings about being attracted to a girl who did his friend wrong. He has to choose between his own physical attraction to her and his loyalty to a good friend. What I especially like is that he doesn't demonize the girl, he just feels the sorrow of having to make that decision. I feel that sorrow along with him.""Sweeter Than Sugarcane"" is a soft, bluegrassy ballad and ""Leanin' "" is a fun country rocker. This CD is so much fun to listen to. I especially enjoy it on a long drive when I can listen to it undisturbed."
5,WONDER WHY I WAITED SO LONG,"I HAD ALWAYS WANTED TO OWN ONE, BUT FELT THERE REALLY WAS NO REASON TO SPEND SO MUCH ON AN ITEM SUCH AS THIS. MY HUSBAND GAVE ONE TO ME FOR CHRISTMAS AND THE MINUTE I USED IT, I COULDN'T BELIEVE HOW GREAT IT IS. IT IS VERY POWERFUL, AND I JUST CAN'T SAY ENOUGH ABOUT THIS FOOD PROCESSOR. YOU CAN BUY A LESS EXPENSIVE ONE OR MORE EXPENSIVE ONE, BUT THERE IS NO NEED FOR THAT. ANYONE WHO IS LOOKING FOR A FOOD PROCESSOR SHOULD CONSIDER THIS ONE BY KITCHEN AID."
1,Wrong Information!,"This is not so much of a review as a correction: this model only has 650 watts of power, not 780 as you state on your site. I was trying to decide whether to purchase the 650 or 670 model and wondered why I could get much more wattage for less money - yes, it WAS too good to be true!"
3,Bury Me,"That's the tune I wanted most on the CD, and it's missing :( The catchy song is by Amy Millan, with Grindig, and it plays over the closing credits.The Three Dog Night tunes are kinda fun to listen to, and they're were one of the better things about this generally dumb movie.But don't get the soundtrack if you're looking for ""Bury Me."" PS: I haven't been able to find it on any other recording."
1,Techno beat from Drowning Mona,"For those of you who are looking for this beat, it's Popcorn by Hot Butter. also mixed by Aphex twin. available on Limewire.take care"
5,Homer and Eddie,A wonderful movie with two great actors. This movie can make one laugh and cry. It is about two strangers that come to trust each other and become great friends. I have seen this movie numerious times and have never tired of seeing it. Both actors put on a brilliant show of talent.Homer and Eddie (The Lost Collection)
5,"No matter the language your kids speak, this is a great book","My kids and I have read the Spanish version (equally wonderfully illustrated) of the ""Libro de las Virtudes para los Niños""... Both the content and the translation are excellent... This book is a necessary tool for parents to instill great sense of values, responsibility, and citizenship, no matter where you come from.Alberto J. PalomboWest Palm Beach, Florida"

3,I have read better,"I had a hard time finding what I needed to locate in this book. I like looking up medical problems and being able to go to the exact holistic therapy for that illness. This book didn't do that for me, although this book did have good information."
1,ronaldbruce@usa.com in Seattle,"As I plodded my way through this book I kept asking myself, ""Why am I reading this?"" I didn't like any of the generic, superficial, generally unlikeable characters, and I knew who the villain was after reading the first few pages of the book.I love ghost stories. This was not even a good one--the ghost being thrown in just to add more fluff to the plot line. This is the perfect book to become the summer TV movie of the week--something you watch and wonder why, after the movie is over, you ever watched it.Barbara Rogan has a good writing style and a feel for suspense. If only she would delve into real characters and dump the stereotypes, she might make readers like me feel more moved than to think, ""Who Cares! """
2,predictable and full of cliches,"This was just an ok book if you are desperate for something to read. It was not at all thought-provoking and was full of stereotypes: the liberal, urban Jew - the uptight WASP - the soul talking, sassy black woman - the womanizing jock, etc., etc. The villain of the story could be picked out of the line-up after a few pages. To all this, add a cop-out ending and you have a very unimaginative story that has been told much better elsewhere."
4,A SERIOUSLY Misunderstood novel,"There seems to be two principal objections to Watership Down. Namely: ""It's just about rabbits"": I find this interesting, as most of these come courtesy of children whining about having to read it as an assigned book. IF OUR NATION'S CHILDREN CANNOT UNDERSTAND SUCH A SIMPLE CONCEPT AS ""ALLEGORY"", I HAVE LOST ALL HOPE. ""Go read Stephen King / Michael Crichton / etc. instead"": Hmmm.... Is someone trying to sound like they're above this book's level? I've personally read Paradise Lost by John Milton, The Divine Comedy by Dante, The Ring and the Book by Robert Browning, and other such brutally lofty and intellectual works, and I thought Watership Down to be a wonderfully constructed story. TRUST me, It isn't one of the grand masterpeices of world literature, but it's MILES above the pop fiction I've seen advocated in it's place."
5,The best story ever!,Watership down is the best story I have ever read. Part one was slow and I was not that interested. Part two the story started to pickup. When I got to part three I had a vary hard time seting the kindle down. By the time I got to part four peole had to pull the kindle out of me hand to get me to stop reading!
2,a dry but in depth look at the life of talking rabbits,"I had to read this book for school and normally, I love to read but this book just wasn't really good.I personally do better with books about people.It was okay,but alot of times it was really dull.The made-up vocab. was an interesting touch."
2,Not as good as Redwall series.,"The title says it. The Redwall series is simply better. It doesn't matter to real readers if a book is a classic or not; it just matters if its good. Everyone out there, read Brian Jacques."
3,An intense fiction,"A story with rabbits in compelling situations makes a fiction worth reading, because the plot makes me want to see the rabbits find their safe and Frith given haven at last. Though it may be a bit long and wordy, it gives a sense of good revolt for the common good in the rabbit world.Hazel and Fiver are the most favored characters because of Hazel's brotherly patience and Fiver's innocent foresight. I would have liked to see the new Owsla Hazel entered into with the Black Rabbit and if the rabbits he shared the warren with are there also.What annoyed me is how Bigwig spoke to Fiver when they were in Cowslip's dangerous warren. *Rages at Bigwig* Bigwig, you wicked rabbit!!! You don't talk to Fiver like that!!! Fiver was only predicting what Frith gave him. You're a big impudent rabbit pile of waste yourself!!!"
3,Watership Down,"Watership Down is a captivating tale about a group of rabbits that have to leave the warren they've known all their lives. When one of the rabbits, Fiver, has a vision they decide to leave the warren. They take a few members of their warren with them on their adventure. On their adventure they go through many obstacles, but telling stories help lift their spirits. The main characters in this story are Fiver, a rabbit who is always paranoid about what is going to happen next, and his brother Hazel who tries to follow Fiver's ideas. When they finally find a new warren they must learn how to find food and shelter.I would recommend this book for 8th graders and above, who like fantasy. Watership Down is boring in the first few chapters, but if you keep reading it gets interesting"
5,An Important Literary Masterpiece,"This has been officially my ""favorite book"" since age 10 (which was 18 years ago.) I still love it. If you've only read it once, it's possible you would get even more out of it the second or third time. The evocative themes are very relevant to moral choices you might make at any stage of life. The integrity and courage of the rabbit heroes is astonishing. Appreciation of the writing inspires you to be a better person--braver and kinder. Nothing else compares to the adventure and relevance of this impressive literary work. One thing I noticed more as I grew older is the natural beauty of the English countryside Adams describes, and the sad theme of humans destroying the environment and habitats of animals."
3,Too long!,"This book was too long in my opinion. When I read it I was in the fifth grade and recall that the book was a contemporary of Tolkien from England. The book was about the affairs of a rabbit warren and the small wars they fought among each other. The animals took on human characteristics, anthropomorphic characteristics, this aspect of the book was good but I think it should have been cut in half."
2,A 10? Please Read My Reveiw!,"How can people rate this book a 10? It's about a group of rabbits that go on a journey to prevent themselves from an unknown tragedy in a warren that a small rabbit named Fiver had a premonition of. I mean it's a book about talking rabbits. I did enjoy the parts when they came across things during the journey, but I did not like the idea of rabbits as main characters. I am 14 and I don't think I'd waste my time reading this book again in ten years ."
4,Very Good but Sad,I liked Watership Down though it is very hard for me to understand at times. It was very beatifly written and very well thought out. I wouldn't recommend it for young children to read though.
1,enough with the bunnies,"I had heard great things about this book, but as much as I wanted to enjoy it I was bored to tears. The endless descriptions of plants I don't care about, the repetitiveness of ""oh, another threat to the rabbits, I wonder if they will be okay or not""... it all got to me within the first 100 pages. The reviewer who said he lost his copy of the book can have mine (no really, take it, please!)."
1,BORING!,"This book was so incredibly boring,. I wish I could give it a no-stars rating. I mean, who cares about a bunch of rabbits. The story was very confusing and got me totally lost. All that happened, was rabbits did this and rabbits did that. There were a few occasional parts that were remotely interesting, but not enough to make it worth reading. I would have stopped reading as soon as I started it except that I had to read it for school. But if you are thinking about getting this, I recommend you save yourself the time and money."
3,my review,"It's a pretty good book, but I agree July 30 reviewer. You shouldn't insult or put down people who don't like this book. They have a right to not like the book. That just shows how inmature all of you are. you frith worshippers need to get a life and not be so obsessed and defending of your favorite book."
3,mehhhh,when i first started t0 read the b00k i th0ught it was quite p0intless 0f a st0ry. But as it went 0n it g0t more interesting but als0 kind 0f hard t0 f0ll0w al0ng with. Watership d0wn tells ab0ut things that happen t0 the bunnys in their everyday lives and s0me 0f these things even happen in 0ur lives as humans. N0t just t0 the bunnys. 0ver all i w0uld say that Watership D0wn was a O.K b00k. It just wasnt what im int0 reading.
5,Watership Down,"Watership Down, by Richard Adams, is a tale that shows courage, determination, teamwork, human nature, ethics and adventure. It can't be said to be about one thing. One subject in this book is rabbits living in a village must flee their habitats, because of destruction by land developers. The rabbits try to search for a safe place, but every corner they turn, danger meets them. Character development is extraordinary, many of the characters are just like humans, because they are talking animals. Adam's uses old folk writing styles, with a ""lapine"" glossary for the language of rabbitese."
5,GREAT BOOK,I am 14 and loved this book. The people who gave it bad reviews don't know what they're talking about. This book does have action and adventure and is not about Blackberry coming home with females. Anyone stupid enough to think that just because talking bunnies are in it it is not a good book should be hurt. Also you would have to be pretty stupid to think this book doesn't have action and adventure.
5,The best of the best; a truly moving novel.,"This is one of those books that you have to keep forever. It's full of adventure, humor, and can be a real tear jerker. If you have just read the first chapter, and didn't enjoy it all that much, keep going! It gets better and better as you read on. If you really enjoyed this book, you should also try reading the Redwall series, by Brian Jacques. They are a lot alike, except for the fact that there are previously 11 of them."
5,A memorable book that makes great bedtime reading for kids,The title of my review says it all. This book was read aloud to my Grade 5 class by our teacher and it had a wonderfully powerful inspirational effect on all of us. I read it to my son nightly. Everyone should have this book read to them.
5,A fantastically well written tale of adventure and bravery.,"Watership Down is a beautiful story. The adventures of a few rabbitsfrom Sandleford Warren is told with great interest and much character.It is purely a classic and deserves a perfect 10! Hazel, the leaderof a group of outcast rabbit, leads the party trying to make the rightdecisions to keep them safe. They faced perilous dangers and mustlearn to get along. Together they make it to their new home, but whatwill happen next as they face the dreaded General Woundwart and hisWarren? It's all in this epic tale of leadership, heart, and bravery.It will surely dazzle the hearts that are touched by this book."
1,The Worst- go read some TRUE American books,"This is the worst book ever. Do not read it. I pity those like me who have been forced to read it. I was bored out of my mind. Who ever heard of talking and fighting rabbits anyway? It doesn't even deserve one star.You shouldn't be wasting your time reading intermediate and unstimulating books like this, go ahead and gets some Ernest Hemingway, Edith Wharton, Theodore Dreiser, or even Stephen King for goodness sakes!"
5,Must Reading,I sent this book to a granddaughter because when my son entered Prep School it was the first thing on his required reading list. I read it myself back then and thoroughly enjoyed it. How little I knew about rabbits before that.Watership Down: A Novel
1,"this book isn't good, it's dumb , Skip this Ship","I can't believe there are so many weirdos that like this book! it was so stupid! about bunch of male rabbits that need to find females to mate with. seems kind of boring to me. I can't beleive it wasn't until they got to their destination until they realized that a male and another male rabbit can't make babies. this book is dumb. the author is ignorant, and the people that like this book insult those of us that don't like this book! skip this ship. If you like talking animals, read redwall, or one of those other silly animal talk books."
1,The Worst book on the face of this world!,"I was FORCED to read this book for a grade 9 project and man i'll tell you, Boring. The book is Chacterized with talking bunnies and animals. I found myself reading like 10 pages just to describe the texture of a plant, when they should be concentrating on the point of the story. I stress if you think about reading this story, think hard. You should spend more time with authors such as Michael Crichton, or stephen king."
1,I was Very Dissapointed,"I expected so much more, I mean, after the great sequel I just HAD to read this. Thing is, I wish I never did start. Okay, so bunnies under attack, but other than the visible notions, it seemed as though nothing happened at all emotionally. The author has lost the respect I had given him for such a great sequel, but this has just backed down my praises of him."
4,You'll hop out of your seat,"This book was assigned to me in December, and I couldn't tell you how much I was dreading this book about rabbits. And I hae to truthfully tell you that the first two chapters tend to drag on andyou will count the mintues that pass. But Parts 3 and 4 make up for it and more. It is a fantastic book with many new and exciting adventures. A group of 14 rabbits trying to find a new home overcomming hardships. If you like Lord of the Rings, try reading the book that started it all."
2,Not that great,I bought Peeps because I really enjoyed the Uglies series. This is not near as good as the Uglies. I really would not recommend this book for young teens! I was really surprised at some of the content of this book seeing as it is recommended for young teens and won children's book awards. Don't let that fool you. I don't think its appropriate for anyone under the age of 17.
3,Good for light duty work.,"This will clean out most problems inside your house and will get some of your main drain clogs temporarily freed. But if you have something serious like roots in your drain, you need the professional grade (AKA Plumber).Also, don't waste your money on chemicals for any outside work. They only work for slow traps with hair and other dissolvables."
2,I'd give it 5 Stars if ...,"... it's not much of a book. It's more like apamphlet. It has helped me though, and can make it easier to draw""correct"" process flow diagrams. But anyone who has had experience in Process Mapping doesn't need this book! Visio has more information about Process Mapping than this book. AS I said, it is very basic but helpful to glace at, It'd be a lot better if the price was at least half."
5,Sheer Brilliance!,"This book has been written by an extraordinary being, whose linguistic arsenal of celestial creativity manifested through impeccable writing skills... have founded my No. 1 author; with Midnight's Children being my personal favourite.Rushdie's magnificent narrative style coupled with a richly-textured storyline all added up to the substance of this best seller; which is beyond my humble words to describe.One of the best fictions that I have read so far. Sheer brilliance!"
3,Didn't really get it......,I was expecting much from this book not having read Rusdie before. I have came away slightly dissapointed. The first few chapters lived up to my expectations with excellent word play and metaphors but overall I found the style this book is written in detracted from the novel. I also found the book too fantastical. I am a hug fan of God of small things so I did not expect the different style to bother me but unfortunately it did. THis is still a good book though & due to the previous reviews there is a good chance that I am missing something ! Perhaps a second chance wouldn't go amiss.
5,Spellbinding,"I read this on the trains traveling in India. Definitely the most enjoyable way to learn about the history of India since independence. It was hard to put down, even while traveling through distant and novel landscapes."
2,Why,Rushdie has done much better. This was not up to par. His earlier books were far better. This was difficult to get through.
3,A little lacking but okay,"You have to remember that this book is one of Linda Howards earlier works and she was just staring out. The story does lack drama. But the main characters hold your attention. The plot is predictable. It's a good book to read on lazy afternoon. I think you will like it. P.S. Linda Howard other books are fantastic, she really grew into her work. Read all her books old and new ones if you want really great books."
2,Will give you frown lines....,"OK, this is an OLD story by Linda Howards ( nothing at all like her more recent books), nevertheless, its STILL one of the MOST annoying love stories out there. If you can take 250pgs worth of seeing a weak, spineless goodie-goodie heroine getting walked all over for the sake of "" showing what love is all about to the man who abuses me in every way"" , then DO read this.Hero walks into town to get revenge from his family after years of being away. Heroine sees the hero, she falls for him, he abuses her constantly, but she cant help falling in love, the MORE abusive and spiteful he gets the MORE she loves him... Hero back stabs her and her whole family, she falls into bed because she LOVES him, and MUST show him she loves him... riiiight...... *rolls eyes*Ahem, so this is what this book is like.....truthfully, is THIS is a romance novel?"
4,Scrabble Wonder,"I love this little device!Helps younger or inexperienced players learn new words (definitions are included, which is wonderful). Also helps experienced players improve!There are games on this item too, have not played them... but I love gadgets that have more than one use!Easy to use, and truely a great item for any scrabble lover!(reduced star due to pricey!!)"
5,Fantastic resource,"I would highly recommend this book to anyone serious about running or endurance training in general. It's very well written, scientifically backed, and comprehensive. A must for any athlete."
2,How not to be able to set your huger watches!!!,"I received a huger/sensor watch for xmas and no manual.I can't even figure out how to set the time.After extensive looking around on the internet,I could not find any information at all. I think Huger/Oregon Scientific/Whoever,Should have that information available to people like myself,THE CONSUMER.Thank You Very Much.Gary Litchfield."
1,a H U G E dissapointment,"first off, let me say i LOVE tortoise... one of the very, very best. 20 years from now they will be studied and broken down like miles davis or coltrane by aspiring musicians. perfection.but this boxset was one of the biggest dissapointments i have ever had with a music purchase. over the span of 3 cd's there was almost NOTHING to catch the ear... unless you are a tortoise junkie and every blippity-bloopin remix is pure heaven. there is a reason these tracks have never been formally released--they are shockingly subpar for a band as monolithic as tortoise. and why would someone ever take something as perfect and untouchable as a tortoise track and rip it up into tiny little pieces, assembling it into something so obviously distant in quality from the original? c'mon.the dvd wasn't much better either. there were only a couple of live clips of high quality, the rest was purely for archival purposes and nothing more.blah."
2,Lots of detail on fighting---little understanding of Lee,"I look for books to provide analysis on the generals and their decisions. While Pfanz's book has great detail on the fighting, it plunges to the other end of the spectrum with no helpful information on Lee's decisions. This is critical to any understanding of the battle because the second day's fighting was the result of what Lee did or did not do.As a result, this reader is of the opinion that one must look to other works to provide much-needed information on such critical questions of ""how and why"" events unfolded as they did."
1,"My worst experience with any media, ever","I bought these for my Mini-DVD Sony camcorder. Most of the disks give me read-errors when I try to view the recorded movie. I've been throwing the defective ones to the trash, now I have about 5 left. I'll buy a different brand and throw them all (verbatim worked like a charm before).I can still save the video (as usual transferring the DVD's to my hard-drive), but there are lots of hiccups due to the very many defective sectors. I have never, ever had such a miserable experience with any media."
5,You'll be the only one smiling in the daily commute!,"Chris Armstrong's second album is as amazing as the first, ""notes in ma heid,"" and a must-have for bagpipe lovers! Both albums combine incredible piping with a variety of ceative background instruments. Quantum Leap has more traditional piping and drum tracks, which will definitely get your blood pumping! This album will hold you over till the next Highland games and gathering!If you see a fellow commuter passing you with a big huge grin on their face, it's either me or someone else who has a Chris Armstrong CD cranked up in the car!"
5,Best of all i have heard,I have heard many variations of this mantra but this one stood out with good pace and great rendition. Great for meditation.
3,Beautiful and moving,"This movie will bring tears to your eyes. Maybe even in the opening credits as the musical score is quite beautiful and angelic. The film appears authentic in it's sets and dialog and Mr. Von Sydow's performance as Jesus and Mr. Heston's performance as John the Baptist are epic. Although it skips many significant events in the life of Jesus, it is inspirational and quite beautiful. I wouldn't say it is a must see but you will be better for it."
2,It was just okay.,"The end of the film has modern commentary that the director wanted to make a film of Jesus without commentary or additions but that's exactly what he did. For example, with the ""adulterous woman,"" Jesus never said ""You've judged her correctly; she has sinned."" He only writes on the ground and says whomever has not sinned to stone her first. Is this significant? Could be. Remember that they only brought the woman, where was the man with whom she was allegedly caught? God's Law requires that TWO witnesses be presented and that BOTH adulterers be stoned. Were there two witnesses? Where was the man? Something to think about.Those kinds of ""little things"" happened througout the movie and bothered me as a believer. Why not just stick to the original text?! The modern film The Gospel of John, I'd recommend instead."
3,Not the Greatest Story but a Good One,"This is a good movie and certainly worth seeing. It may not be as good a rendition as ""Jesus of Nazereth"" but you should see it at least. I was a bit disappointed with the wide width of the wide screen version making it sometimes hard to make things out and impossible to read the credits in the beginning of the movie. The length of it makes it difficult to sit through it all in one sitting, and some obvious cameos for the sake of adding a long list of stars to its credit takes away from it a little. The acting and scenery are great and the music is well done. The story holds our interests as it follows the life of Jesus and his trials and tribulations."
1,I got restless legs during watching,Now I know why this movie was nicknamed 'The Slowest Story Ever Told'. The only thing I particularly liked was Alfred Newman's great music score. He cleverly uses bits form Handel's Messiah and Verdi's Requiem and composes a Bach-like music that caries much of the picture through it's dullest moments.I think all the scenes could have done in half the time and I think that would've given a likeable movie. But not this way.I got bored and my legs sored at the end.
1,BEAUTIFUL AND SIMPLE BUT NOT KING OF KINGS!!!!,"THERE IS NOTHING TO SAY!!!! THE MUSIC SCORE WAS ONLY THING WORTH MENTIONING. IT WAS BEAUTIFUL AND INSPIRATIONAL!!!! JESUS WAS IN HIS EARLY THIRTIES. MAX VON SYDOW LOOKED LIKED FIFTY!!!!EXTREMELY POOR CHOICE! JEFFERY HUNTER PORTAYED A MOST FITTING JESUS IN ""KING OF KINGS!!!!"" THIS FILM WAS A TRUE DIAPPOINTMENT!!!! EVEN TO SEE AND HEAR JOHN WAYNE SPEAK HIS ONE LINE AS A ROMAN CENTURION,""THREW ME FOR A LOOP!!!!"" HEY PILGRIM, YOU WERE IN THE WRONG PICTURE!!!!""KING OF KINGS"" IS THE GREATEST LIVING PORTRAYAL OF JESUS OF NAZARETH!!!! AND ALWAYS WILL BE!!!! THIS ONE FALL FLAT!!!!"
3,Excellent concept restricted by 1960s biblical epic norms,"Despite a fine script and superb actors, the film is disappointing because it conforms to the 1950s-1960s ""rule"" that scriptural characters be one-dimensional and speak their lines in flat and unnatural tones."
4,The Greatest Story Ever Told,Wonderful; Excellent Blue Ray and totally sweeping and awesome rendition of our Savior. Wonderful Actor in Max Van Sydow. A masterpiece for any library.
2,Forget Sams Teach Yourself Photoshop CS2!,"This book is a great disappointment. I learnt more about removing 'red eye' from photographs from the Adobe Help files than from this expensive book. A chatty approach, not very practical. I am now going to buy a copy of Classroom in a Book (Photoshop CS2) as it has been recommended by friends and has many stars in the Amazon reviews."
3,Lacking a few things,"I've recently returned from a few weeks in Tibet. One of my group had this phrase book and we tried to use it to speak with our driver. A few things: First, a pronunciation guide would have helped. Second, we found some common words missing, or at least were not able to find them the way the book is laid out. We ended up drawing pictures on Post-Its to communicate with our driver and learn words from him in this way."
2,Agrees with Bruce Henderson...,"I thought Bruce's book of the same title was much better, and truer to my own experiences as a server. I would suggest others might want to look at that book if they're seeking ""the original"" chronicle of what servers go through."
5,Underappreciated,"Oddly enough, I recieved a copy of this book, as a gift, three years ago. After rushing my education, recieving a Master's degree at 21, I found myself still employed as a server. Needless to say, I related to the story, which some may argue, is why I rated it a five. Most people take for granted, how many educated servers there are and how annoyed we get when you treat us like a ""dumb server."" If I have any hopes for this book, it's that some non-service industry types read it and get a better understanding of ""the other side.""I found this book to be a quick and easy read, but very enjoyable. She reiterates that common curtiousy goes a long way, whether you are a server or being served. Definately a must read for anyone that has waited tables and a should read for anyone that has or will ever eat out."
4,An enjoyable treat,"""Waiting"" provides a glimpse into the life of those we often forget to see, or acknowledge...the people who serve us. If we are to be judged by the way we treat those who serve us, this book reveals us to be a pretty pathetic bunch! This is a engaging story of growing up and coming to terms with choices and circumstances. Debra Ginsberg has a real gift for storytelling. It also reinforced my belief in overtipping.....They do work hard for the money."
3,"Serviceable, but not much flair","This is a very informative, detailed and sometimes humorous look at the world of waiting. It's just too bad that the telling of this potentially rich and textured tale doesn't sparkle a bit more. Ginsberg's prose is competent, but ultimately flat-footed. It's a pleasant enough read, and very educational to those not familiar with the world of waiting, but don't expect an abundance fresh or probing insights."
4,A WEIGHTING EXPERIENCE,"I must disagree with summerfield2 in a major way. I feel the author did a good job of telling her story though I skipped the last 20 pages as I wasn't interested in the subject matter of comparing the job of waiting in various movies.The author did not complain about her job, but detailed the raunchy ""goings on"" in most restaurants among the help and then again the strange ""goings on"" of certain patrons while at the same time getting out the orders and trying to please the customers.Actually the rate of pay for waiting is quite good compared to the hours worked, but, of course, depending on the restaurant of choice. The hours can be most flexible and the job, though taxing physically, can be very interesting and satisfying. A good read!"
1,for the dvd not the movie,"this movie is great. the dvd thats another story. no special features , second side doesnt work in my dvd player. geeze was i wrong to put this on my christmas list. well buy the tape. not the dvd."
3,"Great movie, OK DVD","I love this movie! It is a great portrait of Mozart, and has incredible performances by Abraham and Hulce. The DVD has a few extras, mostly on-screen reading about the film and the characters. There is not an additional footage or documentary. It is a two-sided DVD, and for some reason the movie is split between both sides! It is so annoying to have to flip the DVD in the middle of the film. If you like this movie, it is worth owning. If you are looking for a feature-packed DVD, keep looking."
4,beware amadeus,"Be aware that while the picture quality & sound on Amadeus is exceptionally good - the disc is a 'flipper'. You'll have to turn the disc over 1/2 way through the movie. No reason for this except studio laziness since even Braveheart fits on one disc side. FYI, you also have to flip Riverdance too."
5,Amadeus,"Amadeus was an excellent Movie, very well done, music excellent and customs incredible !! Story is not factual; I recommend it"
5,Excellent Period Piece Drama,"This is a great movie for those who love to revel in period piece movies and music. The psychological logic of Amadeus kept me glued to this movie. Although I usually watch movies once, this one is tempting to watch again."
1,Gratuitous Nudity,"The music of Mozart is glorious. By itself, it has sufficient power to sustain the movie from the beginning to the end. Don't look for historical accuracy here (no scholars believe that Salieri poisoned Mozart) but this is entertainment, not a documentary. The nude scene where Elizabeth Berridge strips and bares her ample breasts is totally uncalled for and destroys the logic of the film. Without the scene, Constanza rightfully resents Salieri for his jealousy of Mozart's unsurpassed composition skills. With the scene, Constanze becomes a cheap slut spurned by Salieri. But if you like gorgeous naked breasts, she sure is a hottie! The theatrical release is much better. Too bad it is not on Blu ray."
1,Amadeus,This movie was not the one that was at the movie theaters. It depicted a couple that was mean to each other and vile. I didn't like it.
1,Don't buy the Director's cut of Amadeus!,"I've been updating my VHS collection to DVD's when I see a good buy. I decided to get the Director's cut of Amadeus which had deleted scenes added. I was prepared for them some of them being silly or unnecessary (as some were), but overall they RUIN the movie! For one thing, the rating is changed from PG to R! I wasn't aware of this when I bought it, but I can see why! I wish I could erase these extra scenes from my memory. You could sympathize with Salieri in the original release. With the deleted scenes added, he's just a villain -- guilty of far worse crimes than anything he accuses Mozart of. The point of the movie is lost, the characters no longer make sense."
4,Entertaining!,"F.Murray Abraham was wonderfully cast as the composer, Salieri, and was so beliveably emotional as he spoke with the priest about Mozart. Jeffrey Jones played the part of the Emperor very well. His line, ""Too many notes!"" is a classic! The first 2/3 of the movie was very well done; however, the last 1/3 seems as though it was written by a different staff of people and it should have had a better closure of Mozart's final days. Overall, a very deserving film for it's many Oscar nominations!!!"
2,directors cut horrible,I have always been a major fan of this movie. I got the first DVD a couple of years ago but it was a bit of a hassle to get up in the middle and turn it over. I was excited by the new two disc version in which the entire movie was now on one side. GREAT I thought. Then the extra scenes popped in which totally were unnecessary and detracting from the plot. Gratuitous nudity and thin scenes that should have been left on the film edit floor. I cant understand what they substatially did for this great movie other than significantly dilute it. I guess I'll go back to my first DVD and just take a popcorn break when I have to get up and chnage sides
5,Is it no 1 ?????,Im taking serious thoughts to vote this film as the best film ever.....No im not someone who is watching a film once in a while...im studying in cinema critics...and ive already seen 438 films only in cinema theaters...so i guess my opinion can be rather helpfull for u people who r wondering rather this film worths it or not!
3,Confusing,Amazon has mixed all the reviews together and doesn't give details on how the versions differ. Recommend people complain to Amazon about this.
4,Darker Vision of the Great movie,"New scenes show Amadeus as a more troubled person...more of a deadbeat.New scene shows his wife, Stanzy, in an - um - compromising position.New scenes show Salieri as a big dirtbag.The scenes make the movie different, not better."
4,Amadeus,"I saw this film in the theatre when it was released and thought Tom Hulce SHOULD have received the Oscar instead of ""what's his name"" who went on to fame because of the Oscar. Tom was ROBBED. I purchased this video to watch on my 54"" flat screen. I still think Tom should have won the Oscar! But it is still a great film about Mozart."
3,Not as good as Theatrical release,"I have to agree with the review by ajofarc, this Director's cut is simply not as good as the Theatrical release that won all those Oscars and deserved critical acclaim. Most new scenes just add unnecessary length to the film, the nude scene is totally unnecessary and changes the tone of the film. The DVD picture quality over the previous flipper hasn't improved much, colour has been corrected but the image is still soft, lacking definition and is grainy. Sound quality is still relatively poor and has less bottom end than the previous release.Warner, please do this great film justice and release a fully restored theatrical DVD."
3,Director's Cut isn't Worth It.,"Amadeus is a terrific movie but the Director's cut isn't worth the additional cost. Lengthy scenes of operatic performaces have been added, offering little to further the storyline. Unless you're a true opera fan, stick with the original version and save yourself a few bucks."
4,Easily one of the funniest movies made.,"The F word flys around this movie like bugs around a light bulb. It makes is so hilarious. The movie has some of the funniest lines ever missing. From Euchre's ""Just a bit outside!!! Tried the corner and missed."" to the fan's ""Its too high!"" as a home run sails over their heads.This movie is a Ricky ""Wild Thing"" Vaughn fast ball. Used up and never used ball players are supposed to form the worst team in baseball history. Instead they come together and give a classic baseball and comedic performance."
4,Great cornball baseball,"Okay, so ""Major League"" won't rate as one of the greatest comedies or baseball movies of all time. Still, this film is a must for all baseball enthusiasts. While Tom Berenger and Corbin Bernsen do admirable jobs, it's really Charlie Sheen, of all actors, who steals this enjoyable movie.The comedy is low, most of the time, but it doesn't dwell on the scatalogical, as most comedies for the past few decades have. And you'll never listen to ""Wild Thing"" the same way again."
3,Older Movies,"Still very funny. Randy Newman sountrack, great comic performances and some pretty funny observations. Tom Berenger's character only gets weak when he's chasing the girl."
3,"Funny, but overrated.","Yes - It is a funny movie. And my wife does love it. But, the movie is mediocre at best."
1,Major DVD Disappointment...,"I LOVE this film... since it's initial release, it has been one of my ""guilty pleasure"" VHS tapes. Now that the DVD has finally arrived after several years of waiting, I feel as though I've been taken. In the first place, this film is OBVIOUSLY CROPPED from the 4x3 format to make it look as though it's widescreen. This is NOT the theatrical ""widescreen"" release. Check out the opening scenes where the Indian's futility is told via a series of newspaper headlines of the times. Most of the headlines have the upper halves of the letters CHOPPED OFF! This is SHAMEFUL! The DVD's producers have actually given us LESS than the VHS tape. Second, there are NO, NONE, ZERO extras on this DVD. What exactly were we waiting all this time for?Anybody out there who waited as I did for all this time for this DVD is in for a big letdown."
4,Great Baseball Story,I have the second part of this movie Major League Part II and knew that I had to get the first part to add to my DVD collection.
1,Really dumb,Trite and Stupid. One would have to be awfully bored and/or drunk to find any humor or entertainment in this.
1,Terrible Machine,"Terrible Machine to deal with in the morning. Carafe is larger than the reservoir, so the reservoir overflows. Barely makes 12 cups. Auto-stop does not work, so coffee spills all over the counter when attempting to get a cup. Pour spout is distorted on the carafe, spilling when a single cup is poured quickly. Makes instant coffee sound good...."
4,Creative,"Ruled Britannia is not for everyone. It almost wasn't for me. No matter how great Shakespear's plays are I have a hard time translating the old English prose. Turtledove uses the prose when the book's characters speak and sometimes it disrupts the flow of the book. Fortunatly his narration is in modern english and I could keep interested in the plot. Engrossing it is. If you like historical novels you will love this book. Who gives a hoot if it is alternative history, Kenneth Roberts please make room for Harry to join you as one the elite historical novelists."
4,Definitely good reading,It took me a while to get into the first book but once I read it I wanted to read all the remaining book in the series. It took me a while to track all four of them down. NOw I can't put it down. Definitely kept me interested the whole time. I took it on my trip to London and during the 9 hrs flight time I only got up once to use the restroom. I was totally hooked. The characters are starting to develop more and become more likeable.
3,Watch out for that little control dial!,"This is a great toaster when it comes to the basics of toasting breads, bagels and pastries, but watch out for the control dial! I am on toaster number four due to the dial getting broken off. Kitchen Aid is wonderful when it comes to sending me a new one but it would seem that if I am having such problems with the dial breaking, others would too."
1,...,This is the one Kitchen Aid product that could plummet them into bankruptcy. The plastic light-dark control knob broke-off after only 2 uses. The so-called defrost feature is a joke and couldn't pre-thaw a slice of rye bread let alone toast it. Bagels won't fit into the wire holder contraption thingie. The bagel button must control the garage door because it certainly has no visible effect on anything that's inside the toaster (if that's what they're calling it these days). It has 4 red pilot lights that I'd just assume have given up for a third helping of toast (which I'll never see). I wouldn't recommend this sleek and attractive overpriced paperweight to anyone. Stick with the mixers.
5,A Uniquely Voyeuristic Journey,"Take a couple days off work, find a nice spot to read, and get busy turning pages. This book is very hard to put down. As soon as I finished it I flipped back through it reading at random. Afterwards, I contacted the author for updates on the main characters. It's that good."
3,ALRIGHT,THESE HEADPHONES SOUND VERY CLEAR BUT THEY DON'T GET HARDLY ANY BASS SOUND OUT OF THEM. THEY ARE VERY COMFORTABLY
1,Not what it claims to be.,"This is not straight up solo piano meditation music. The music jumps all over the place and its very hard in one word to label it. Its not slow,solo,relaxation music- end of story."
2,Does NOT work for 2005 Toyota Matrix,"I bought this product for my 2005 Toyota Matrix as it says it works. However, even after having it PROFESSIONALLY installed the installer stated there is NO WAY this was made for Matrix. He had to put all kinds of spacers and trim off 1/4 of the box (taking the bottom COMPLETELY off). If you have a Matrix consider something else. This product was horrible."
4,A letter from home,"My maiden name is Hoover. Our family story is that we didn't want to claim our foggy relationship to J. Edgar. Millie's book was like a letter from home. I applaud her efforts and courage to enlighten those of us who had no clue about the truth hidden in family secrets while my white lineage took advantage of our priveledges in a white society. Through her work, I've met a long lost cousin and kindled new hope that we can heal another chapter in the sad story of America's race relations.Knowing this book was a personal accomplishment of a woman who graduated from high school nearly illiterate adds another angle of interest to her work. A facinating story."
3,"One great song, otherwise o.k.","Would that Bono could have sung on more than one track. The haunting, splendid ""Slide Away"" saves this album from itself. Otherwise, except for a few songs, it all sounds like the same techno wah-wah."
1,Broke affter a week,I had it attached to my hip and sat in a car and the plastic clip broke off. In other holsters they are designed with a break away clup so it can be reattached but this just broke. I would not recommend.
1,Doesn't work.,"I've twice called Kitchenaid for help on this product, but they can not get it to work. It simply doesn't juice. period."
5,Great Results,"I was skeptical of this attachment, but I am very happy with the results. I have had juicers before so I know what works and doesn't. This attachment was easy to use and was very effective. The pulp was dry so the juice yield was good. However, I would not recommend this for someone who wants to make juice in large quantities, as you need to clean the filter relatively frequently. Also, after making carrot juice the white parts of the attachment turn orange and do not clean easily, but I do not regard this as a major problem."
4,Enlightening! Where's my suitcase?,"Although it's small, this book really made me think. The holidays don't have to be stressful. This year, when the family gets together I'll be carrying ""love, patience, and stop at one helping allright already!"" (Although that wasn't one of Mr. Dispenzer's suggestions.) I've decided I'm going to try building an altar in my hotel room and really try to celebrate the joy that comes from connecting with family. I said ""try."" I thought the book was well written and I'm going to give them as gifts."
5,Wow! Amazing Book!,"I was given this book for Christmas and did not read it until after the holidays. What a bible of information. I am definitely going to give this to my mother, daughter and some friends that I know will benefit by these words of wisdom. I certainly am now a fan of Mr. Joseph Dispenza and will read other books he has written. Hopefully, he will continue to write and help us deal with life!"
2,CUANDO SOLO QUEDA EL NOMBRE.....................,"MUCHAS VECES ME ASALTA LA PREGUNTA..ES VALIDO SEGUIR CON UNA BANDA CUANDO QUEDA SOLO EL NOMBRE...NO ES LO MISMO PASAR A CONVERTIRSE EN UNA BANDA DE COVERS PROPIOS?

1,Different merchandise,"I have ordered these before. These came in and they were smaller and not the same as the previous ones. Also, there were only three. Apparently the fourth ""free"" was not shipped? Would like to have the ones that I have ordered before."
4,great design,"I thought the design of the wolves look great .its going on my golf cart, hope it holds up in the out side weather"
5,"The best, simply the best Food processor you can buy","There is NOTHING about this food processor I do not like:It is simple to set up, it works like a champion, it does every task asked of it with out a struggle and it cleans up easily. I have had two other food processors and this one is better by far in every way. The disks are sharper out of the box and hold the edge better; they are well designed for their given task and perform the tasks flawlessly. KitchenAid has a world of option available as well. Buy it YOU WILL LIKE IT"
3,"LOVE THE SOUNDATRACK, HATE the fact it came DAMAGED!","So I got this for a girl, who LOVES'S The 10th Kingdom, the music, the tv movie, the acting. I got the soundtrack for HER as it was on her wishlist.She recieved it, the CD case had 3 cracks (so she can't read the music listings on the back) and the front has 2 cracks. One LARGE and medium sized one.Why wasn't this packed in a small card type box that's meant to hold a CD? Did you sell it with cracks? The package it was mailed in had no scuffs, tears or any other damage to it.She loves the soundtrack don't get me wrong and the CD itself is fine, but was very saddened none the less.P.S. she can't switch to a different CD case (she shouldn't have to) as the back credits/soundtrack listing paper is embedded in the back part of the CD case."
5,Keep them coming!,"You can't stop the Misties! The box sets keep coming, and the episodes are still as fresh as ever! This box set is a real treat with the inclusion of a season one episode, and the special features are as special as special gets! Soultaker has always been a favorite episode of mine, and the others are just as priceless. Keep them coming!"
2,To Protect and To Serve,"I cannot speak to the author's research until after his discussions in 1962. As a former officer, having experienced the Watts riots, worker the riots and assigned to 77 Street Division, all I can say is he is WRONG about the riot. His depiction of a rouge Department is unbelievable. Allow me one example. I worked Wilshire Division in 1962. We had two man patrol units then and even before that. The author claims two man units were introduced just prior to the riots because of the tension building in the community. That is false. There was no tension. The bottom line is simple. EVERY NEWS channel showed the looting as it was occurring. It could not be stopped. There were 200,000 people rioting with 3,000 officers on duty to protect 465 square miles of LA. All we could do is surround the area and prevent the riot from spreading. Not until the National Guard was called in and a curfew established was order established. I find his book scattered with misinformation."
3,Please enter a title for your review,"another waste of time reunion just like Dinosaur Jr's. just like J Mascis And The Fog's Free So Free was a better album than Beyond, Bill Janovitz And Crown Victoria's Fireworks On TV was a much better album than this."
3,tedious,"I read this years ago, when I read everything by Washington Irving. At the time I thought it was romantic and a nice satisfying, slow read. Reread it recently, and I find it a little too romantic and rather tedious."
2,Does not deliver,"These are adequate for the fall but I bought these with the intention of using them in the winter <35 degrees but they do not work. The tips of the fingers are freezing numb by the time i get to work, and my commute takes about 30 minutes. The gloves are also poorly designed the inner layer is extremely difficult to place back after you pull them out of the shell. I think the best thing to do is to get a pair wind proof goretex gloves shell and a layer like polartec."
1,BikeSomeWhere Co. sells shady version of this Glove,"I love these PB Borealis gloves, actually. But I recently bought a pair from BikeSomeWhere Storefront on Amazon and the glove was made of a strange foamy material, not to Planet Bike standards. The material that covers the top of the hand has large pores, but the real Borealis glove has a tight-knit material. The palm of the hand is like spray-on foam, but the real Borealis glove has a leather/suede palm. My husband and I each got a pair from Amazon (sold by different companies), but the size large from the BikeSomeWhere Storefront is questionable. Don't buy these gloves from the BikeSomeWhere Storefront company."
4,Nice and toasty for cold mornings.,"These gloves are really nice. They cut the wind and really keep my hands warm. I think I'll even use them for skiing this winter! Having the two smallest fingers bundled together is a nice stroke--keeps them warm, but keeps the other fingers free for bike tasks. My only concern is that, when I perspire during my morning commute, the gloves don't dry out during the day. But besides that, excellent!"
4,Great biking gloves,"I commute on my bike daily and those gloves are really great for temp down to 40F. However at about 35F they get to be too chilly-although I do ride 6.5 miles and maybe on short runs they would still be fine. Apart from that they are all you want in bike gloves=-they look and fell great, can get you through 35 min ride in rain without feeling wet and cold, have good grip and reflective tape and coloring make them really safe for riding in the night. Definitely great buy!"
4,Keep the wind off your hands,"Great product. Keeps the wind out, fleece liners that are removable. A bit cumbersome and 'clumsy' on the bike, but worth it when it's both cold and windy. Work well into the low 30's with 15-20 mile per hour winds."
1,Wrong Language.,We accidentally ordered a book in the German language so we could not read it at all. The book looked good and we passed it on to our high school German class. Airport by Arthur Hailey.
5,Much better set of mixes than I thought.,I bought this cd single because I needed the catalog number. What I got was a great surprise. Those who know the mixes of Benassi Bros. then you know that they mostly sound the same: loopy hard technolike keyboards that loop over and over and are very short. This is what their Sfaction mixes sound like. The best mix though is the original Extended mix which is a bit Euro /Disco in sound and is a gem. The vocals are by Sandy who has done work with K.M.C. and others . She shines on this song. This track reached number 4 on the Club Play chart. Here is the track listing:1- French Original Radio Edit (3:20)2- French Sfaction Radio Edit (3:35)3- Original Extended Mix (5:42)4- Sfaction Mix (5:21)Excellent.
3,Passable Western,"Joel McCrea, Zachary Scott, and Douglas Kennedy star as friends and partners whose ranch is destroyed as the Civil War rages on. Needing money to restart, they end up running guns for the Confederate Army, leaving McCrea's girlfriend Dorothy Malone behind and tangling with saloon singer/businesswoman Alexis Smith. However, each man wants something different, putting the former friends at odds with each other. South Of St. Louis is a passable film, neither exciting enough to be memorable, nor dull enough to be given a bad rating. The actors are competent in poorly drawn characters, the script average, the direction acceptable. Alexis Smith's saloon singer appears to have some spark to her in the beginning, but she quickly fades. The film needs some spark to get it going and to make the audience care. It's an average movie, nothing more, nothing less."
5,Slammin',"Great Material&Strong Production.The Vocals Never Let Up Here.First Class Songs all the way.Runaway Child RunawayRunning Wild,Cloud Nine are Very Direct&Honest.Very Essential."
3,Defer to anonymity and personal experiences,"I defer to the good Library Journal review, to anonymity and personal experiences.More often than not, the most effective, helpful presentations (for the skeptical, cynical addict) are those that can in no way be associated with a financial profit motive or other material or status gain by the author of the presentation. Additionally, as the author relates his/her own personal experiences (successes and failures before and during sobriety), so the audience relates. A cold, impersonal, and literal ""interpretation"" of the principles of the material that was printed over 70 years in the past is not as effective as a presentation that lives in the author's present moment. Even the ""original"" text admits ""we realize we know only a little"" and implores the reader to seek out guidance from others (medical professionals, clergy, etc.) who are more experienced and more knowledgeable."
5,Outstanding!,"This is a fabulous tool to use in conjunction with the Big Book and the 12&12. Easy to read. Easy to understand. Easy to follow the steps. I was sponsored with it, and I use it with everyone I sponsor."
2,Sour taste,This version of Stone Soup leaves a sour taste in my mouth. At the beginning I was especially disappointed that there were no polite words like please and thank you. The boy also tells instead of asking. The other thing I don't like is that the old woman basically lies about not having anything to eat. Both of these issues are bad examples for my child.
3,Stone Soup review,I like the book very much but disappointed when it did not come with the CD. I was refunded my money for the purchase of the book but would have rather had the CD to go with the book.
3,Service was great,The product wasn't what I was looking for but the service was great very responsive when I returned the product
2,Better versions of this product out there.,"I bought this to replace a Mckenzie Neck Roll, as this one was much cheaper at the time. I had the Mckenzie neck roll for a few years and it was getting flat so thought I would try this one. My experience has been that this neck roll is cheaply made and doesnt hold its shape well at all. Within one night of sleeping with this neck pillow it was already pretty flat and wasnt gaining its shape back. For a few extra dollars I'd go with the Mckenzie, much better quality product."
1,Not what I thought I was Getting,"The description was vague. I thought the product was a firm foam roll to put under my back and roll up and down on. The product is merely a soft blue pillow, not really any help to the back"
5,Great,The RPJ series is a super line of novels that lead you to the end of the world as we know it. Or maybe not?
4,My First Repairman Jack,"I have never read Repairman Jack before but now feel compelled to go find some of the older ones. Usually I am not a fan of sci-fi, paranormal, ""Otherness"" but found myself wanting to figure out what what going on. The blend of fantasy/sci-fi that Mr. Wilson employs here worked for me. Now I need to find some more Repairman Jack and find out what makes this guy tick!"
5,Back in Action!,"F. Paul Wilson's iconic hero-without-a-history, Repairman Jack, is back for his seventh, and possibly finest, adventure.News of an accident involving his estranged father sends the self-styled Mr. Fix-it to a creepy retirement community in Florida, where longevity is a theory, not a practice.If the culture shock isn't hard enough for NY's native son, a string of unsolved murders and some very creepy locals alert Jack to the fact that the supernatural Otherness, which has been plaguing him since Wilson's THE TOMB, is back for another helping.With enough action, firepower, one-liners, and wicked monsters for a a dozen novels, GATEWAYS showcases F. Paul Wilson and Jack in top form-- kicking bum and taking names.See for yourself why Repairman Jack is the greatest series hero in modern genre fiction!"
4,Good Cookin',"If you've never had to make homemade Challah before (or you don&#65533;t even know what that is) and always wanted to learn how, this the book for you. Jewish Cooking for Dummies is the perfect book for the novice Jewish chef. It has recipes for every major holiday, and some not so major ones, with recipes for every day of the week. Faye Levy, who has previously written other books on Jewish cooking, delivers again with a well thought out book. There are tips for keeping kosher, for substitutions, for making things faster. It's everything you need if you&#65533;re just starting out in the Jewish kitchen or in a kitchen in general. The only real complaint I have is that the recipes are very basic and that there aren't enough to go around. Also, many to the recipes take longer to make than listed in the book, especially when you first start making them. You gradually improve, but plan a little bit of a cushion into your work time."
2,Save Your Money,"A complete waste of $$$, very few recipes. The only knish recipe is for spinich. Talks about A meat blintz but no recipe.Only good if you want to learn how to keep A kosher kitchen."
5,Stendahl,"I have many Mega Bloks dragons. This is one of my favorite dragons in my collection. It roars when you push the crystal button on his armor. I like the armor on his chin. It can be removed. It comes with a mini tower that includes a torch, flag and an Odaku warrior that has a shield and an ax. The shield and ax can be removed. I hope that this helps you to make a decision about buying Stendahl."
4,$400! Are you kidding me??? Price Gouging!,I hope this is a typo because the most I've ever seen this listed for is $199 and that was too high...but $399??? Are you kidding me??? No way.
4,Purchased for daughter. She really seems to like it.,Easy to use. Nice addition to kitchen aid mixer. Can't wait to get a sample to try from my daughter.
1,One of the worst thought-out attachments ever.,"I bought this as a replacement for my $30.00 Atlas pasta roller, thinking that it would make pasta making that much more fun. Huge mistake.First off, there were quality problems. After exactly one year of use, mine broke due to low-quality steel used in one of the attachments. So I'm out $100, and I'll get over it.The bigger problem is that you have to continually change out the attachments to make pasta. First, you attach the roller, and get the dough down to the proper thickness. Then you must remove the attachment, and replace it with a cutter or crimper to form the dough into its final form. Attaching, then detaching, gets very old, very fast. I felt a certain glee when I threw these pieces of junk into the dumpster. I'll look forward to my old Atlas next time I feel the need to roll pasta dough.Worst thing Kitchenaid has ever made!"
1,Beware! First batch of pasta may contain copper!,"I attended a cooking demonstration featuring the KitchenAid Pasta Roller attachment. It looked fun and really easy so I bought it. Unfortunately, my delight in this product was thwarted by the ""dirt"" that seamed to be leaching from the rollers. I tried cleaning the rollers with the supplied brush and then I ran a clean dry cloth along (not through!) the rollers and found that the ""dirt"" was actually metal! I removed the roller from the mixer and found that a copper piece attached to the underside of the roller which scrapes the roller and keeps the dough from entering the housing of the unit was flaking off in little slivers. I don't know if this problem would have corrected itself, but for the amount of ""dough"" this thing cost, I wasn't going to wait and find out.As for the operation of the roller attachment. It was fun!"
2,plastic parts shear off and fail,"The pasta roller works fine for a while but ours stopped rollingwith a ""snap"". I took it apart and found that a crummy piece ofplastic connects the impressive big metal drive shaft to the pasta rollers.That piece of plastic sheared off and the part is not replaceable.Back to the hand-crank Atlas Pasta Queen while I decide whether tospend another $100 on the poorly designed kitchen-aid roller."
1,Terrible Qualtiy Control by the vendor,The original box it came in was ripped and damaged and the interior packaging was not there (plastic wrapping) - Obvious the item was returned by someone else and then repackaged and sent to me. Terrible Quality Control.
4,"KitchenAid is the best, but.......","I LOVE my KitchenAid mixer. I just wish I had had it 30 years ago. Couldn't justify the cost then and now I can't fully utilize it. All our kids are gone. Anyway, this pasta roller is wonderful......puts out a great product, but! It is HARD to clean. Get right on the clean-up detail. Don't let anything dry on it or you will be scraping dough off it with a stick!I just wish I had had the wherewithall to purchase these wonderful appliances when the kids were little. In those days, I mixed and rolled by hand. No one complained about the end product, but it sure would have been easier with the pasta roller!"
2,Pasta Cutters Suck,"I have been using the pasta making attachment for several months now and am completely disappointed. The roller works great and I use it for making ravioli and lasagna noodles. But the fettucini and spaghetti rollers/cutter are horrible. They score the pasta NOT cut it into individual pieces!!!! So that after it goes through the machine I have to separate each strand by hand which is insane. I just made enough dough for 11 people who are coming for a dinner party tonight. I have given up on the separation of EACH STRAND of spaghetti (which stretches the strand and makes for inconsistent sizes) and am going to the supermarket to get some dried pasta. I am not a happy girl, what a waste of time. I am going to try and return it."
1,Its firmware corrupted quickly,"It got corrupted for a few days when I used it with windows vista as a ready boost which totally useless technology . . . I don't know exactly which one was the offender: windows vista or Xportetr XT flash memory.nevertheless, I'm not glad with my purchased."
4,Great Umbrella Stroller,"I needed a stroller that would fit in the trunk of my tiny Kia and not cost me an arm and a leg. The Hula was the stroller for us.We have used it for 6 months now, since my daughter was born. It is not intended for placing newborns in it, but it holds our Graco carseat and comes with a strap to secure the seat to the stroller. A raincover and suncover were included as well.It folds up small and is lightweight, so even I can easily get it in and our of the car.The basket underneath is small and not accessible when the seat is reclined, but this does not bother us, as we don't use it for shopping trips.When I first got it I thought it was a little flimsy, but we have taken it to Europe and gate-checked it a couple of times(and the airlines are not exactly gentle with them) and it's still in top shape.I really like it and would buy it again - however I would not pay full price for this, I got mine for about $130 on sale."
4,"Nice system, okay product","I really like the FastTrack system, and have used it throughout my garage, but I must say that this shelf and hook assembly is not up to the standards of the other items in the product line. This is the only attachment that required assembly, which isn't a bad thing in and of itself, but once it was assembled it had a decidedly flimsy nature about it. I had to basically 'hold it together' while attaching it to the track. Once installed, it held fine and felt sturdy, but repositioning it on the track is a pain. All in all, it does it's job satisfactorily."
4,"good sound, just a few hickups","The speakers are clear, I haven't had any problems with rattling or distortion at high volume levels. The speakers still work well when using batteries to power it, no loss of volume. The remote isn't too powerful, need to point directly at the front of the dock for it to be recognized. Kind of bummed that the video out doesn't work with my 160G ipod classic, stupid Apple."
2,mediocre sound,The sound from this unit is mediocre at best. I actually believe it is way overpriced . I have a logitech 2.1 computer speaker system that cost about have as much and sounds 10 times as good.PROSnone......CONSvery poor base responseweak treble outputcheap cheeseee overall sound....remote ipod functions are limited
2,Below average performance of an early inferior Mascagni work,"Technologically poor recording with all sorts of extraneous noises coming through. This is probably Mascagni's worst composition and it receives a barely adequate performance from an orchestra and chorus I never heard of conducted by Marko Letonja who has little understanding of Mascagni. The soloists finally calm down and sing with some sensitivity in the final Agnus Dei otherwise ""can belto"" pretty much reigns."
3,It is ok,The book seems to be biger than it really is in the website and it does not really serve much of a purpose.
5,DooWop Yayyyy!!!,"Thanks oh so much. The CD was the bomb. I love the DooWop Era and music, it is all I listen to. I'll have to get more cds from you if possible. Thank you forever, God bless and Happy New Year !! OllieDoowop Jukebox"
1,kitchen aid mixer attachment pack,absolutely the worst service ever. i ordered the item on 6 jan 07 and it has been delayed twice! the latest until sometime in april! never again!
1,Attachment Pack,"The grinder works great. The slicer/shredder is worthless. If you want a grinder, order it seperately. If you want a slice/shredder, order a food processor. The slicer/shredder did an awful job on onions, mushing them up, and dropping large chunks into the bowl. Celery had the celery strings all wrapped around the drum. It did do a good job on potatoes, shredding them nicely. You also need two pairs of pliers to take the drum off the shaft when you're done. And, a plastic spatula from my Braun food processor was great to scrape the potato remains from the drum."
1,Poorly written European tablid drivel,"I was disappointed to find that what I had hoped would be a respectable (and possibly well written) history of the lives of the papal descendents, was indeed a tabloid newspaper several hundred pages long."
1,Not much about Sex Lives of Popes,"This book concentrates mostly on the sex lives of political officials and priests as well as the policies of some popes. It has very little to do with the actual sex lives of popes while they were popes.Here is what he says about Clement XIII on page 257:""The most intolerant pope of them all, Clement XIII (1758-69), ordered nude statues and paintings - including the frescos in the Sistine Chapel - to be covered up""And on page 126:""Clement VI began a period of unbridled luxury.""How shocking!!! It has little to do with the Sex Lives of Popes.Half of the popes' sex lives dealt with are ones who were legitimately married and he has basically nothing to say about popes after 1800, except for on page 264:""John Paul II ... was rumoured [sic] that he was married and widowed."" Really?Cawthorne has a field day with Alexander VI, the most infamous pope of all time."
2,was incapable to use for canning juices and applesauce,I purchased the strainer for juicing tomatoes and applesauce for canning. I think for baby food it would be great but to try applesauce or tomatoes it is totally useless. The end where the peels and seeds come out is so small a tomato seed got stuck. It could only take very tiny amounts at a time and it was very slow. The seller very kindly allowed me to return it and did not charge the full re-stocking fee. Although the blurb mentioned canning it is worthless for that use.
5,Fun to use,"What can I say? Great product, nice material, looks like it will hold up. Did try to put a carrot through but stopped since I figured it probably isn't designed for that (but it did squeeze a few drops of juice out!!)"
4,self,It works great for the homemade tomatoe juice and sauce. It is easy to use and easy to clean. Works great.
2,Only for frsh graduates.,I am in embedded world for 8 good years and brought this book to know something which I dont know. This book is purely for fresh graduates out college.(that too only when they havnt worked hard in their courses) also if you have been in industry but didnt get chance to work on actual system then this can be of little help for you.Dont buy it if you have already spent a couple of years on actual systems. You wont benefit much.
3,"didn't fit, unsteady.","Although my kitchenaid is one of the listed models for this jacket, the jacket hooks were too far apart for the tabs, and even bending them in slightly made the jacket very jiggly on my mixer. Since I planned to use water the unsteadiness mixed with electricity worried me. I followed the directions that came with the jacket. It's also not dishwasher safe. For these reasons I returned the water jacket. It seemed like a really good idea and I'm disappointed in the quality."
5,"Superb Thriller, 5 stars.","This movie brings it all: suspense,action,romance and chills! Ray Liotta is amazing as a nice guy cop who slowly falls apart and becomes a delusional lunatic that is obsessed with his newly found freinds wife .Madeline Stowe is great as a bored houswife that falls for Liottas creepy charm despite the warnings of her somewhat helpless but revenge drivin husband played by Kurt Russell who also turns is a heartfelt performance.It all comes to an intense and action packed climax at the end. Liotta steals the show with his uncanny ability to be a warm & charming freind one minute and an ice cold & diabolical killer the next."
2,OK dress shirt,"I have bought white shirts for years. I was hoping to find a good quality shirt that is %100 cotton yet less of a need to iron. This shirt after one wash needed extensive ironing, and even then looks poor. It is not a thick material and does not hold up well at all with wearing. I need to wear an undershirt because it is see through."
2,Not a MP3 Player,"I bought this unit for my son. The hardware itself performs well.The software is where it goes bad. In the specs it says it can play MP3 files. What it doesn't tell you,you can only play books that can be downloaded from an audible.com site.Not what a young adult is looking for, books!!!!!!!At this time I can't find any audio player that can be used with the BE-300 that would let you listen to music MP-3 files.Another problem with software is that the bundled software only allows it to sync to outlook. It doesn't provide a desktop scheduler to sync with like PALM and Visor units. Bottom Line, to sync up with a desktop PC you must have microsoft outlook. I think people would be better off with a visor for scheduling and a real MP3 player to listen to music. If Casio wants to compete in this market they will have to provide stand alone software that is useable for scheduling and a MP3 player that can play music"
2,Good Mixer But It Doesn't Last,"We've had this mixer for three or four years and use it mainly for beating egg whites and mixing up hot chocolate. In spite of the light use, it stopped working. . . will not turn on. We called Kitchen Aid and they said it's out of warranty and cannot be repaired. Very disappointing, especially since the Kitchen Aid stand mixer we've had for 11 years, which gets heavy use, works fine. We threw it out and ordered a Cuisinart hand mixer as a replacement."
4,Kitchenaid's 9-Speed hand Mixer,"My previous Kitchenaid mixer died from the usual beater clip problem-the beaters would not stay attached. I read a lot of Amazon reviews, and no serious challenger was mentioned, so I went ahead and ordered the 9-speed model, which actually cost less than the 5-speed model. So far, So good-the 9 speeds are useful, and I especially like the torque-sensitive electronic feature which beefs up the power for stiff items like frosting and dough. For 59.99, it is a really good deal. Whether it lasts 10 years or more is anybody's guess. I say go for it!"
2,no good,"I bought my 9 speed black professional kitchenaid hand mixer about a year ago now. As you would realize, the mixer was only used a few times during this period, maybe 3 times. I went to use it again and it won't even turn on. I can only assume the motor went bad. I am extremely disappointed with this product. I have always liked the kitchenaid products and for this to happen makes me upset. Unfortunately I can't locate my receipt so I am out of luck. Be careful!"
2,Worked well but died young,"I bought this mixer in June 2006 to replace a mixer I had owned for a decade or two. The KitchenAid worked fine for about two years. Then the nine speeds turned into one speed with no variation, no matter what setting I chose. A few months ago it simply refused to turn on. I tried it several times, and occasionally it worked. Now it is totally dead. Is two years a decent lifespan for a mixer? I don't think so.KitchenAid KHM9PWH 9-Speed Professional Hand Mixer, White"
2,turbo beater failed,I bought this mixer and only used it a couple of times for routine (not heavy duty) mixing. The turbo beater broke shortly after a year (the wire came loose where it attaches at the top). I called the company expecting a free replacement and was told that I had to buy it (you need to buy 2 for $19 includinf shipping). I was so dissapointed that I put the old GE hand mixer back into service after more than 30 years of use without a problem. I think that the turbo beater design is not robust enough and can fail very easily.
1,Mine died after a little over a year too,"I've only had my Kitchenaide Professional 9 mixer for a little over a year too and suddenly it just stopped working! I've hardly used it! I'd love to get a replacement. Any ideas on the warranty, anyone?KitchenAid KHM9PWH 9-Speed Professional Hand Mixer, White"
2,could be better,"I purchased this mixer because of the Kitchenaid name which I equated with quality. From the first use, I was disappointed in the lack of power this mixer has when mixing cookie dough. I have owned much cheaper mixers that did a superior job. After owning this mixer for approximately two years, one of the metal bars on the beaters came unattached, making the mixer useless. I will not be buying another Kitchenaid mixer."
5,Tickled Pink,"Love, Love, Love this Kitchenaid mixer!Works fantastic! Very quiet! Extra attachment is great!Should have bought one of these long ago!Nice to have stainless steel beaters, never need to worry about them getting rusty over time."
3,It's ok but there's got to be a better one...,"I got this hand held mixer after my Cuisinart died. I had the Cuisinart with the timer and when I went to replace it I couldn't find it so thought it was no longer made (though I think now I may have been mistaken). Anyway, I read the reviews on this mixer and it sounded good so I bought it about a year ago and now I can't understand the rave reviews. I find the handle to be small and uncomfortable and I don't have large hands; it is tilted at a funny angle and it's too tight. The power is certainly adequate for whipping cream and light batters but really grinds away at anything heavy. The cord is at a strange angle which makes storing it in a drawer difficult, not impossible though. Anyway, I find myself avoiding using it--the opposite of how I felt about my Cuisinart timer. I recommend skipping this one if you do a lot of baking."
1,Died After 1 Year,Bought this mixer for my Mom and it died the same way as described by others. It won't turn on or do anything. It was a good mixer when it worked but for the price it should last longer than a year!
3,must charge if used infrequently,"I purchased this product several years ago because of the glowing reviews here. For the most part I am happy with it; it is a nice mixer with good power but is not too heavy. But I only use it infrequently - maybe a couple times a year. When it sits unused for a long time a battery inside or something gets drained, because I have to plug it in and let it sit there for 30 mins to an hour before it will turn on. After that it works fine, but if I don't remember to do this it won't turn on and it's useless."
5,Best so far,Best book in the series so far. The charcters are so alive that you feel like you are reading history.
2,nice cover but the dye runs badly,"I got this cover for my new Kitchen Aid and was pleased with it the first few weeks. Until, that is, I got it a little dirty and needed to run some cold water on a small portion of it to remove a tomatoe sauce splatter. The dark dye started running *immediately* onto the white and I was madly trying to stop it before it got too bad. I fixed it as best as I could but about an inch all around one side on the trim is a light blue from the dye. I now have to remove it whenever I cook anything that may get on it and it's very impractical. Being in a kitchen, this cover is extremely likely to need washing from time to time and I found it just ridiculous that this is basically impossible to do without ruining it."
2,Depends on Why You Want It,"I primarily bought this to make grape juice for jelly, and the grape seeds were just too much for it to handle. I think something with a greater proportion of soft fruit/vegetable matter to seed (like cooked apples or tomatoes) might work ok. But it just bogged down and clogged up, creating a huge mess. The hole at the end of the strainer (where the rejected material comes out) is just too small. I went back to doing it manually with my colander before it was over.To reinforce what everyone else has said, it is also annoying that the tray is so small, and basically requires you buy the extender tray to use it. Once purchased, the extender tray isn't a sealed fit, leaks, and adds to the messiness factor. The grinder has only 2 cutter sizes. I expected the larger cutter to allow a coarser grind. There should be at least 1 more size to allow more versatile usage (like relishes).I just expected more."
1,Save your money,"This attachment is so disappointing. I've used it three times: the first time with cooked tomatoes, which worked great. The second time I ground tenderloin and it came out with grease all over it. Not sure how since I cleaned it well. That ruined $30 in meat. The third time, I ran cooked spinach and beets through it. It is currently jammed up and unusable. Amazon says that their return policy expired 14 days ago. I bought it two months ago. Total waste of time and money."
3,"Works well, but...","The tray on the top of the unit it very small. Yoy can only put about 1/2 cup at a time in it. I know they make an attachment you can buy for like $25-30 to give yourself a larger tray. But it should just be designed larger. We usually make about 15-20 quarts of Applesauce at a time. the larger tray is a must. The ""pusher"" to move food down the throat is a bad design. Should be a solid cylindar instead of a cross shape. Tends to catch food and is messy.The end result of using it is good, but it's over priced, and could be designed a little better."
2,Shoddy and inflexible,"I chose this product based on another reviewers statement that this was the real deal so I ordered five of them since they're not available anywhere in my town. It's not my real deal. The ""flex"" rubber nozzle? Ha! If you bend the nozzle to use it in a flexible way, it comes out of the metal attachment. That's just a little too flexible for my tastes. I prefer my flexible nozzles to stay attached.Also, there's a plastic watersaver inside the screw-on part. Take that out. The spray wouldn't work for us until we removed it.I hoped I had found the answer to my problem. I didn't. I used to be able to buy these and they would last for years. I went through two of them the first week I had them. I'm really disappointed. I'll work my way through the other three and then look for another answer."

3,"Initially fun, but too simple and repetitive","Pros: challenging for a beginner, steps are small enough to do in a small exercise space, decent cardio work outCons: essentially only one routine, she teaches you one step at a time and you keep adding an additional step until the full routine is complete - can get boring after a while. I've only used this DVD once since I've purchased it b/c it's a bit boring and doesn't motivate me enough."
2,NOT GREAT!!,THE VIDEO WASN'T AS FUN AS I EXPECTED THERE ARE ONLY ABOUT 4-5 BASIC STEPS. AS FOR THE DANCERS IN THE BACK THEY LOOK LIKE ID AREN'T REALLY INTO IT. THIS IS NOT TEACHING YOU HOW TO DANCE SALSA AS IT SAY OR THE MUSIC IN THE BACKGROUND IS NOT SALSA.
4,why all the bad reviews?,"I've been a long time bob mould fan. First listen shocked me, but after a few plays I really started to appreciate it. now it's in regular rotation on my playlist. I enjoy every song. sunset safety glass' weird frenetic keyboard noise and bass groove rocks, I think. Slay / Sway and Trade are great, too. I'm a big fan of Sugar's ""Copper Blue"" and I hear bits of that on this album."
1,Bob has lost it,"This record is really bad. I'm a fan of bob from way back but this has got to be the worst thing he ever put out...by far. But like an earlier reviewer said, at least he is recording somthing."
2,"Bob's not funky, but that's OK.","Been a Mould fan since Black Sheets of Rain, worked backward to Husker Du, then went back forwards to Sugar and more solo stuff. Never been dissapointed or on the fence with any of his work in the past. I'd buy his album, pop it in and get instant gratifiation.Modulate has changed this. I tried listening to this album with an open mind. However, the fact remains that Mould's strengths are not in the realm of electronica. I listen to Mould for the wall of sound guitar, powerhouse melodies and intelligent (and sometimes cathartic) lyrics. If I wanted to hear electronica or dance I'd get a Moby album (which I did).On the other hand, I salute Mould for having the balls to put this album out."
1,Extremely disappointing,"There are a couple of songs that aren't bad, but I can't help but imagine how incredible they would have been if you swept away the amateurish electronic squiggles and bleeps, replaced the clumsy drum programming with a live drummer (like Matt Hammon, who livened up ""The Last Dog And Pony Show"") and pumped up the guitars.I hope Bob can figure out how to create electronica that is as distinctive as what he created as an alternative rocker. But this just isn't going to cut it."
2,Uninspired,"I have no problem with Bob venturing into electronica - it's just that the songwriting on this CD is so uninspired. There are only 2-3 decent songs on the album and one of them was written during the Workbook/Black Sheets time period. He just doesn't come across like he's passionate about making music anymore. And in my opinion this album is just the latest in a string of less and less inspired work. Beaster was his last really good album - but you can even see the decay in the quality of his lyrics between Black Sheets and Copper Blue. Oh well, maybe you've got to hit some lows before you can hit the highs again. Overall he's still my favorite songwriter of all time hands down - and his recent stuff is still listenable to if mediocre especially by Bob's standards. And I'm sure I'll always buy his latest album in the hope that one day he hits his stride again."
2,Price was right,"We actually never used it. We sent it back right away just by the looks of it.My Dad does a lot of meat grinding and making homemade sausage. He uses everything metal. Unfortunately, it didn't look like it could handle the job it was really meant to do."
1,Didn't work for me,"I tried small link type sausage. ""Snack'in Sticks"" from High Mountain. Meat was difficult to get into the auger area and kept sticking in the tube. Then produced large air pockets wasting long segments of casing. Basically didn't work very well at all. I quit and started using my jerky gun. (the cauking gun type). The only positive was that the tip attachment from Kitchen aid fit my gun. The gun worked much better."
2,Works technically,"This works if you will not be making much sausage and enjoy the hassle of running ground meat through the kitchen-aid meat grinder. I personally do not, so I bought a vertical cylinder stuffer and have not been sorry since."
1,casings stick,I let the casings soak for 1/2 hour and still had a hell of a time getting them on the funnel
4,"Not bad, the pusher is useless","If you are using this sausage set up, the combo stuffer/tool thing is garbage. Other than this, no problems. I made 50 lbs of kilbasa and 30 lbs of mild link. Ended up just pushing the meat in by hand as the stuffer is useless and more trouble that useful. I am going to make my own stuffer with some solid plastic stock.Follow the directions, 4 setting on the speed is best."
3,KitchenAid quality ?,"Stuffer attachment well made but required some hand fitting to fit my KitchenAid. I wouldn't hesitate to buy it, but manufacturer should include fitting instructions as it is not worth sending back to manufacturer for adjustment."
5,KitchenAid SSA Sausage Stuffer Kit Attachment for Food Grinder,Very good to make small amount of sausages. I love it.KitchenAid SSA Sausage Stuffer Kit Attachment for Food GrinderI wish to find one bigger for salami.
1,Useless,"The Kitchenaid grinder attachment works well. However, the stuffer is absolutely useless unless you plan on making just one or two sausages. It took three of us more than 2 hours to stuff 15 lbs of sausage and that was after the mixture was ready. We'll be looking for a dedicated device."
2,tried and tried and tried,"As much as I would have liked to write a good review, I have to say I gave it a good shot. I tried all the ""tricks"" previous posters suggested but in the end it was hopeless. Every other KitchenAid accessory I ever purchased was well worth it except for this one. I ended up getting a sausage/jerky gun to fill my casings, that was OK but kinda slow and it only held a small amount of meat. Although I didn't want to spring for the $$$, I'm going to get a dedicated sausage press and do it right. For me, it's also a matter of saving time and it seems a ""real"" sausage press will save me the most."
4,Take a wild ride to the far side of the Cadillac Desert...,"and hang with the Dead Folks! On the Far Side with Dead Folks is a faithful adaptation of Joe Lansdale's classic zombie story On the Far Side of the Cadillac Desert with Dead Folks. It is vintage Lansdale, vulgar, funny, and, odd as it sounds, achingly humane. A mixture of the Romero Mythos (the original story was written for the anthology The Book of the Dead) and pulp men's adventure yarn, Dead Folks tells the tale of a tough bounty hunter that captures one bad dude, only to run into a crazy cult on the way back to collect his reward. Things get a bit complicated after that. Of all the Lansdale adaptations that Avatar has done, Dead Folks gets my vote as the best. Highly recommended to Lansdale fans."
4,Its Good! Real Good!,"Timothy Truman and Joe R. Lansdale did a great bit of work here! If you loved Jonah Hex Two-Gun Mojo, Jonah Hex Riders of the Wyrm, or Lone Ranger and Tonto, then you'll like this one too.Timothy Truman is a great artist. If Sam Peckinpah had done comics instead of movies he would have had Timothy Truman doing the art. Truman does great action scenes, full of gun play, bullets, tissue damage, gore, sweat, tears, and blood. He also has an eye for detail, though that's more apparent in his period pieces ""Jonah Hex: Two Gun Mojo"".Joe R. Lansdale tells a good story. Just the right combination of sci-fi and grit. These guys are a great team.I think this is a great buy at $9.99. And if you got the money I would also recommend ""Jonah Hex: Two Gun Mojo""."
1,Two words: Just Awful,"Normally, when writing a review I try to make it pretty in depth.However, in this case, two words will do: Just Awful.How awful? Awful enough that I can't even summon the words to explain WHY it's so awful. And I'm a man who's NEVER at a loss for words."
5,Pretty Shadow Box,"This is a very pretty frame, elegant and versatile. I used it for a photograph to have added depth but you can use it for thicker items as well. It is black, plain wood, nothing fancy but also something that is classic and will last for years to come."
5,Much Food for Thought!,"My Utmost for His Highest is an excellent devotional book--short daily readings that always challenge your thinking and motivate you to consider what's most important in life. I especially like the vest pocket version I purchased, which is leather bound. Because of its size, it's easy to take along; and because it's leather bound, it's very durable."
2,Basic Navigation Problem. No TOC. Can't go to a DATE,Caution. Beware. Defective in design. It is a Daily Devotional and the only way to navigate it is one page at a time - all the way thru it to the day you are looking for.
5,Oswald Chambers renewed,My third copy of Oswald Chambers book is as spiritual as the firs time I read this remarkable collection of his works.
5,Highest Praise,I really like the updated version that doesn't rely on King James English. It is great to have it on my Kindle so I can use it wherever I am.
5,Next to the Bible,"Along with my Bible, I read this book every day.It is still a timely source of inspiration and instruction.I have given it as a gift to several people.I am amazed at how the author has such insight and wisdom.He was a man after God's own heart."
5,My Utmost For His Highest: Updated Edition,This is an amazing devotional. It is easier to read than the original version. God speaks thru the pages. I cannot convey how much I have enjoyed having this devotional as a part of my Bible study and prayer time.
1,"Great book, lousy formatting.","5 stars for content of this timeless classic. 0 stars for no formatting, which, in a 365 entry daily devotional, is ESSENTIAL !!! What were they thinking of to miss that, and at $9.99 a pop? How come I'm the only reviewer to mention this?"
5,Great Daily Devotional with Daily Scripture Focus,"This is a great daily devotional that points you to scripture and then life application. While I LOVED my older edition of Oswald Chambers, reading it in contemporary language makes my quiet time flow easier because I don't get hung up on Oswald's old english."
4,flawed ideological history of nationalism,"Elie Kedourie obviously has an axe to grind about nationalism - as a Jew he was exiled from Iraq and settled in London. In this book he traces the ideological development of nationalism from Kant, Herder and Fichte, claiming that nationalism was invented when Fichte gave his Addresses to the German Nation in the early nineteenth century. Kedourie unfortunately places far too much emphasis on Kant - who was much more concerned with the individual than the community - and not enough on Hegel. Kedourie also neglects such important writers as Rousseau and Mill and does not attempt to trace just how Fichte et al. influenced specific nationalists. Nevertheless this is a well-written polemic against nationalism from someone who dealt with it first hand."
4,pleasantly surprised,"I am very pleased with this product. They provide excellent coverage. They DO show through some thin and lightly colored shirts though- not so much their color but their shape- so for white summer shirts I might end up resorting to the now ubiquitous ""t-shirt"" bra. But all in all it's a very good product, easy to use, hopefully not toxic (the material is not printed in detail on the box)."
3,Uhhhhhhh . . .,"These make you look like you have HUGE, HARD, nipples! I've tried everything for nipple concealment. I figured out that while these, alone, look obscene, and Smartcups or similar foam cup inserts are too thin to do ANYTHING in the way of nipple concealment; together, they provide a working solution. These bra discs do block whatever is going on with your own nipples, and while thin foam inserts do not, thin foam inserts will cover up the great big knob that these Bra Discs create. Not a good daily solution, perhaps, but for the occasional formal event in a form-fitting dress, the two, together, do the job."
2,"Bo Derek's first movie, for completists only.","This was Bo Derek's first movie, filmed some time in the mid-1970s, but released after her success with ""10"". It's interesting for Bo Derek fans to see a young, dark haired Bo Derek. And she's charming as always. But there's really no other reason to see the movie. There's hardly any plot, so the movie gets dull pretty fast.""Fantasies"" is for Bo Derek completists only."
3,Where are the Enrights?,"The Enrights are one of the most real and loving families in romance(herMOON DANCE is the best), but for some reason Miss Stewart didn't put them in this book. This book is OK, but not vintage Stewart. She tried too hard to make a mystery and didn't spend enough time with the hero and heroine. Plus, I'm from the same area where the story is set, and she made it feel like a travelog, not a real place, which isn't like her usually. Come down and visit, Miss Stewart! Better yet, bring back the Enrights in your next book!"
4,Crossing Gates,"Somehow I thought this was powered by the rails, but it's not.It is ""gravity"" powered by the weight of the train. Lighter cars cause the gates to bounce back up. Also, the lights are only decoration and don't blink.It's a nice unit, and it was fun to have around the christmas tree, but I should have looked closely at what I was getting and set my expectations accordingly.The piece is the standard length, so I just had to get another straight piece for the opposite side of the track (not included), and it was easy to assemble onto my existing train set.It works as advertised, the gates close when the train is passing."
3,"Ok, but...","This hood seems to be very well built, however it is a screw in type of hood. So, if you ever use a filter when you have your lens hood on, you might want to look for a different brand!"
5,A Book of Great Import (no pun intended),"Heinberg's ""The Party's Over"" presents a thorough, understandable, and logical discussion of the history of the petroleum industry and what we need to do about the growing crisis. He paints a pretty dim picture, but also provides a list of potentially mitigating measures that individuals, groups, and decision-makers might -- and indeed must -- do to avert a situation that will quickly grow out of our control unless we act now. This book should be widely read and discussed, NOW."
3,Not What I was expecting,It works fine except that the juices from the tomatoes leak out. Good for dry things but not for juicy items.
5,you need this,I can't imagine making applesauce without this. It makes it so easy...its not perfect...but you still need this.
3,Could use design improvements.,"The tray attachment can leak, if you're not careful. The area where it slides on to the food grinder chute has a gap. As long as you don't overfill the grinder, it's fine...but that defeats the purpose of the food tray, which, to me, is to add a large quantity of food at one time. It prevents having to hit a small target (the food chute), but could perform better if the connecting seal was tighter.This, along with the food strainer and food grinder, should be one attachment package."
2,Wish I had read the reviews,Love my Kitchenaid stand mixer. But wish I had read the reviews on this grater.slicer.Pulverizer is more like it. Leaves big chunks in the hopper.Very uneven chopping/slicing.Bought it without checking because I assumed if it went on the mixer it would be as good as the mixer. WRONG!
4,KitchenAid Mixer Attachment Slicer/Shredder,Length:: 0:31 MinsMy husband's favorite part about my Kitchen Aid Mixer is the cheese shredder. This clip shows just how easy it is to shred Parmesan cheese...
3,Shreds great but nearly impossible to take apart,"I've read the pdf document and the instructions that came with the attachments. It is impossible to EASILY remove and trade out the shredding attachments. I can't tell that the lever latch does anything. I have to have my husband remove the attachment after the rest of it is off because it takes so much force that I'm afraid I will cut myself. If it were made WELL it would not be so difficult to remove. It otherwise shreds great. I've only used it to shred cheese so far and it does it with great ease, and works well in that regard."
2,Not too excited. Not enough value for the money spent.,"I read many reviews before buying this item. My main interest was to shred cheese and I found many reviews talking positive about the ability to shred cheese easily. My wife has carpal tunnel and both of us hate shredding cheese with a manual cheese grater. I bought this item thinking that I would shred cheese in bulk and store in a ziploc bag. I was very excited but lost the excitement after my first attempt. Issue #1: Cheese needs to be frozen before you shred. Issue #2: Cheese starts flying around the counter top and I feel like I need three hands to do a good job; one hand to push the cheese down, the other to hold the huge bowl, and the third to try and deflect cheese from flying out. I get tired holding a huge bowl with one hand and trying to shred with the other hand. Issue #3: Hand washing this item is not so easy and I do not like it. My overall comments: It is not worth the money. This item is not for all folks."
2,Not worth it,It is not easy to attach and not very good at slicing.Get a real food processor instead.
2,Waste of time and money,"An avid amateur chef (and gadget freak), deeply in love with my stand-mixer for baking, I thought this seemed like a good idea for our favorite quick salads like grated carrotts and apples etc. Unfortunately I am not impressed. Unless you make copious amounts of shredded veggies I think you are better off using a regular grating iron. Any time you save cranking stuff through the shredder is quickly lost on clean-up. Get a good grating iron instead, replace it when it gets dull. Be happy. My set is sitting in the back of a cabinet after only a few uses."
1,Shockingly lousy,"To test my shredder/slicer attachment I tried fine slicing cucumbers. They were a mess of partially sliced and mostly torn apart pieces. The skin got stuck inside the unit, unsliced. The slices were awful.I'm beyond disappointed but not surprised, really, based on the reviews. I had to try it. Now I'm sending the whole useless mess back. I'll go back to my trusty mandoline and my box grater. Lesson learned.KitchenAid RVSA Slicer/Shredder Attachment for Stand Mixers"
5,"EXCELLENT PRODUCT, THANK YOU!!",THIS PRODUCT WAS CHOSEN TO COMPLETE THE PURCHASE OF KITCHEN-AID. I received it in good condition. Working properly. scratch Italian-parmesan cheese.
2,Kitchen Aid Slicer/Shredder Replacement,"Bought this to replace a cracked shredder attachment after many years of use. The attachment works fine but was disappointed with the cutting blade quality. Washed and left out to dry and they showed signs of rust the next day prior to use. They look inferior to our originals, slightly darker color stainless. Have never seen rust on the original ones in about 20 years. Looks like they have cut quality of the material for the cutting blades. We are still using the originals."
2,Not quite what i thought,I really wanted this to do a nice job of grading cheese or making hash browns. it takes such a small scratch that your left with rather fine shavings rather than what you would expect. The sclicing part works fine. It's also a bit high off the counter when you start processing stuff. I was disapointed when i used it. would rather have spent the money getting something that worked.
5,CEOSR,"I love it, it fit right into my Kitchenaid mixer and it is so easy to use, Don't know why I waitted so long to get one."
4,Attachments work well...,"I use the shredder attachment the most and I like it very much. We like to shred carrots for carrot salad. Yum! I just purchased it and have not had the chance to use the other attachments. KitchenAid speaks for itself. I have always liked their products. Hope this helps. Blessings. <""((><"
2,Just get the Food Grinder,"Ok, so I don't actually own this product, but I'd been wanting to get it for some time. Then I read the numerous reviews/complaints about it. Among them, however, I have yet to read the following suggestion: Just get theKitchenAid FGA Food Grinder Attachment for Stand Mixers. It works great on cheese. It appears that the people who are most pleased with the slicer/shredder attachment are those who are using it to grate cheese. Unfortunately, if it only shreds cheese well, it's not terribly versatile. The overall complaint seems to be that the slicer/shredder doesn't tend to work as well on other items, including most veggies. Again, I haven't used the product, but I have the grinder and have been very pleased with how it works for grinding cheese (not to mention meat; even though I haven't tried grinding veggies, this is also a recommendation from KitchenAid). I wanted to share that tip."
2,Over rated,"This attachment did not preform to the expectations I had been hoping for being made by KitchenAid, it mashed and tore at the sliced potatoes I was attempting to slice up. The cutting blades are very dull and being new these blades should have been razor sharpe."
1,not as good as they used to be,"My original mixer and attachments were from the late 80's and has worked perfectly for years. We bought this kit when the plastic housing on my original set cracked. So instead of searching for a used one on ebay, I decided to just by a brand new one since I use my attachments frequently (about once a week). I am very displeased with the overall quality of this set. The plastic housing is thinner material than my original, so I have no doubt it too will crack. But the worst part is the blades. I use the small shredder and the disc slicer regularly and when I tried these out, they were so dull that they didn't cut my vegetables as much as ""chew"" them up. I am very disappointed with kitchenaid or whoever bothers to manufacture this product."
2,Disappointing,"This attachment does not fit properly in my machine. The shaft is too long to lock it in place. Rather than going through the trouble of returning it, I think my husband can make it work but it's super frustrating. I had also hoped that one of the inserts would produce a slightly larger end product. It slices a little too thin for soups, which was my primary reason for buying.Amazon handled the order well, and it shipped super fast. I think it was on my doorstep within 24hrs and it was the week of Christmas! I did not pay extra for expedited shipping. Thanks amazon."
5,Great price,Highly recommend this supplier and this item. Great alternative to bulky food processor and you can't beat the price. I actually bought one for each daughter. They love it.
1,Do not buy,"An utterly worthless product. This device was incapable of slicing anything, and the shredder attachment was able to shred about 2 cups of carrots before jamming, bending the drive shaft, and causing an alarming click in the drive of the mixer itself. KitchenAid support was great; sent me a new mixer right away. They offered to replace the shredder, but I told them not to bother, and returned mine to the store to get my money back.If you're looking for a slicer/shredder, you're better off with the KitchenAid food processor. I picked up one of those and couldn't be more thrilled."
1,"A goat's beard, a rusty nail, a single flake of oatmeal....","are things that you would better spend your hard earned cash on than this insipid book. ""oohhh.... I'ma woman! All I wants is to be purty and have my knight in shining armor! Who needs to vote?!?!"" This is why I despise most christian women."
2,Didn't like it,"When I first began to read Captivating expected it to be based on Christian beliefs. As I continued reading, I found this was not true. The book makes many references to popular fiction (fairy tales, books, movies) while including just enough scripture to be considered spiritual. Even when considering the book from a secular point of view, it did not make sense. It presented ideas that were contradictory to one another and did not address the contradiction. I never felt sure about the message of the book; it went in circles without reaching conclusions."
4,Very helpful book,"This book has a better writing style than other Christian nonfiction I've read, and I found it very helpful."
5,Both Men & Women,"Over the years I have had several women tell me how beneficial they've John Eldredge's other books to be, such ""Wild at Heart"", even though such books were targeted towards men.In the same way, even as a man, I found ""Captivating"" to be very insightful and beneficial.For that reason I would recommend it to both men and women alike.Also HIGHLY recommended:""Buried Alive"" by J. Jacob Jenkins"
5,Captivating,A must read for every woman to help her see that she is not alone and that there is a way to heal from her wounds. It's also a must read for the man in her life so that he can understand the nature of her spirit and how to cherish and protect it!
5,Life changing,"I read Wild at Heart when it first came out and it had a major impact on my life and allowed me to see my then boyfriend in a different light. I was able to see him as God saw him and am now married to him and we're having a daughter. Knowing I was having a girl is what made me buy Captivating (Wild at Heart for Women), because I want my daughter to grow up with the right messages and a healthy self-image. I was at first afraid it would be too much repeat of Wild at Hear and that I wouldn't get that much new insight out of it.It has helped me accept myself and my God-infused identity as his daughter. It has made me excited about having a daughter and helping her to grow as a woman of made in God's image - the crown of creation. I'm so grateful for the content and honesty of this book."
1,Not much clarity or substance.,"I agree with all the reviewers who have noted that this book has a very narrow view of women. It's so focused on the wounded or helpless woman seeking rescue, you'll probably wonder if these authors developed their view of women from patients in crisis therapy. Or maybe that's the kind of woman who shows up in their Christian-fundamentalist seminars. Either way, It just doesn't describe the women I know.Also annoying was that this book didn't seem to have a clear purpose or much substance. It's easy to find a fictional movie character or Bible quote to support anything in the world (you can find Scripture passages recommending killing children), but what does that prove? Not much. It circled around and around vague phrases like 'the secret of a woman's soul', but didn't provide much in the way of insight or interest. It's like they kept promising they had something important to say, but by the end I was wondering 'what was the point of all that?"""
5,Captivating by John and Staci Eldredge,Best book I have ever read on being a woman! Very helpful. Would recommend it to all women and men.
5,Highly Impacting,"A wonderfully insightful book about the heart of a woman. This book is not intended to replace your Bible, but it offers a gentle view into the way you (as a woman) have been ""fearfully and wonderfully made"". It's a wonderful journey that is not intended to replace a Bible study. My husband is about to read it too so he can understand me better :)"
1,Holier than Thou,"I hated this book!! The authors write in a ""we know more than you could ever hope to"" fashion that made me angry every time I tried to read it. They write like they have a personal hot line to God."
5,God spoke to me through this book,"although this isn't fiction, it contains many interesting and personal stories. it absolutely changed my life, the way i look at myself and Who i believe God to be. i remember something from this book every day and open it very often during the year. i daily thank the Lord for bringing it my way... thank You"
5,Captivating,This is such a great book. I got it for my niece for her graduation party. I can't wait to give it to her. I just want her to know how captivating she is!!
1,Just pathetic.,"This book does nothing for ""opening"" women's hearts. It is the same Christian dribble over and over again. Same lame stories to back up said dribble. Nothing new here. Nothing to open your eyes, mind, spirit, or heart. Don't waste your time or money!"
1,A lot of emotional fluff,"I think this book has a good central message but it is filled with so much emotional fluff. It really could have been condensed into about 25 pages. I felt like it dragged on and on. I also felt like saying, ""get over it"" throughout the whole book. Yeah, everyone has had a bad past but rather than dwelling on it and considering how it has effected our lives let's just come to the understanding that we are beautiful, God loves us, and let's move on. No sense in getting emotional about it."
2,Cheap material,"After the first washing, the shirt had a hole in it. I was disappointed because it was soooo cute."
5,Much Nicer than Expected,"I was pleasantly surprised when I received this passport cover. It was made of soft, supple brushed leather, and looked like it cost a lot more than the few dollars it cost. One other note, as I travel a lot, I now use a British crest embossed passport cover instead of a United States seal embossed cover for security purposes."
4,Watch Out For Curves,"This crossing can't be used on a curve; however, I was able to get use from it on my layout. It is very basic with a low price. You might consider Bachmann's actuated RR Xing if your crossing is on a straight section of track. I used one on an N Scale layout and it worked beautifully."
1,Toy Story 3D - Problem with discs hanging up,"All three of the 3D discs in this package had the same problem - they would play for a while, then they would stop playing ... after a few seconds start up again but at an earlier point in the movie.I don't have this problem with any of my other 3D (or non-3D) discs. Just this series. In my opinion, they were poorly made.Great Toy Story content, just bad media."
3,Good Bargain for a Complete Set,"It's a little disapointing that this set is nothing more than the regular Blu-ray Editions bundled together with nothign exclusive to this set, but you are getting $105 worth of content (3 blu rays moves at $25 each and digital copies for Toy Story 1 & 2...a digital copy is included with a single Toy story 3 purchase but not 1 & 2) for $65...which is not bad.The case they are in feels a little cheap and takes up way to much room on a shelf, but thats my only real complaint. The movies themselves are classics."
3,lukewarm,"I was excited to see this set. I love all the movies and was eagerly awaiting all of the special features. I was really disappointed in the packaging, a card board box with cheap form holding the discs in place. I would have rather had jewel cases, or some sort of folding packaging. The card board and foam really cheapen the look of the set. Great price for all the movies, but lousy packaging."
3,Foam disc holders!,"Just opened the 10 disc set and was very disappointed/shocked to see all the disc's are just held in the box by foam rubber. I was expecting individual cases like the Shrek 4 pack. You would think for the price and the outstanding movie quality, Pixar would/could have done a lot better of a job."
3,Not what I expected,"I ordered this as reviews stated that it was the DVD/Bluray combo pack, which IT IS NOT. I mean, the movies are fantastic, and I'm sure the quality is great, but this set ONLY includes the Bluray. No DVD, no digital copy. I will be returning and ordering the combo pack. If you look closely, there IS an option for the combo pack listed below under ""other options and formats."" Other than that, order which set you want, and enjoy. I suppose I assumed that product reviews get linked to the appropriate products, but that does not appear to be the case here."
1,should be cheaper,"This 3 movies should be at least $30 cheaper than buying the 3 complete combos, for an extra $20 you get DVD Blu Ray 3DBLu Ray Digital copy and extra features, this item is just not worth it[...]I was just in time to buy this combo packs before their prices went up, got the 3 combo packs for $88 instead of lowering the first 3Dpack which i'm making the review of, amazon preffered to increase the prices in the separate packs"
3,Note: Blu-ray 3D versions only,"Please note that this set only comes with the Blu-ray 3D version of the films. If you are looking to buy it to get regular Blu-ray, DVD and/or Digital Copy versions of the films, you will be disappointed. Many of the customer reviews listed below are actually for the set that DOES include the BD/DVD/Digital Copy version of each film and not this one. If you are simply looking to get the 3D versions of these films, this is your ticket."
4,Can't wait!,"Just purchased this neat box set as an anniversary gift. Very eager to see her reaction to the iconic Andy's Toy Box! Within the last two days I've purchased the same Blu-Rays at two large chain stores for a MUCH larger price. Despite the reviews of the toy box being ""dinky"" I would liek to think that it will be a blast fromt eh past each time we flip the lid for a marathon! One store $150 (All 3 just as the chest contains), Second store was a wee bit of a better price of only round $75 (All 3 but also included 3D Blu-Rays). For $30 cheaper & unwilling to spend another $2k to get a 3D TV to replace my 50"" LCD I think this is the wisest choice. Can't Wait!"
3,"Great movies, cheap packaging","Have to agree with the other reviewers. Wish I would have bought each one individually. No way to keep the dvds organized or for the kids to easily find the movie they want. Will have to purchase a case to keep them organized, irritating!!!"
3,"""Collectible"" packaging","Mildly excited, waiting for the ultimate 10 disc set. I wanted my two boys, ages 1 and 3 to be able to have this media experience for their childhood, so I'm expecting to receive something substantial to weather the years. The collectible toy box provided for disc storage was the ultimate...joke?!#!!What a disappointment to open this up and discover 10 discs sitting in a foam cutout, all encased by a flimsy, laminated, waxy shaped toybox, which slides into the paper presentation box to be proudly stored on your shelf for the millenia...or next week, until one of the rugrats decides to take matters into their own hands and opens it themselves. That will be the end of the ""collectible"". I suppose Pixar's definition of collectible is, "" for adults only"". Very crappy job on the packaging, for the money I spent I would have much rather purchased each movie individually - with blu ray cases."
1,Regret,The packaging is awful. I truly regret having purchased this item. It's worth the extra money to buy each movie separately.
1,"Like stated in previous reviews, this item skips and is low quality.","These movies are great, but a ton of people are having issues with skipping and hang ups. I have had similar issues.I bought a brand new samsung blu ray 3d player and this is the only disc collection I have ever seen skip. I do not recommend these."
2,"Great price, TERRIBLE packaging, be aware","My son got this for Christmas from his grandparents and although we are extremely grateful and the price on this is great, the way the discs are packaged is terrible. As others have stated, they do not come in individual cases or even slip cases, they are just positioned in a foam block. It is really difficult for my son to properly put them away himself, so I am worried that over time they will get left out and scratched.Be aware that if you want to keep them well protected, you will want to purchase jewel cases or at least sleeves separately. The foam block CAN be removed and the discs stored in jewel cases inside the toy box, which is what I'm guessing we'll end up doing.Can't complain about the price though, and it only took me about 5 minutes to get all the digital copies loaded into iTunes and onto the ipod, which is great."
3,"Decent performance, let down by poorly balanced sound","I admit to sometimes having doubts as to whether Child of Our Time is the masterpiece some peoples seem to think it is. And this performance here surely hasn't settled the question in my mind. The soloists are very fine, Palmer and Langridge sing with power and involvement and Shirley-Quirk is magnificently dark. Sheila Armstrong is, perhaps, a tad unsteady at times, but not so much or so often that it becomes a serious detraction. My questions concern rather Previn and chorus and orchestra, for Previn's direction seems dull and meandering at times, and the orchestral response seems somewhat murky. The chorus doesn't exhibit much by way of power, either. Now this might be due, at least to some extent, to the recording, which is dull and lifeless and seriously misbalanced - in particular, the soloists are far too forwardly placed, drowning out both chorus and orchestra. It isn't, in the end, a bad recording, but not one to live with either."
4,adapter,I got a yellow one. It does what it should I think. I bought it for a specific item but turns out that item isnt going to work like I thought but Im sure this thingy will come in handy one day. It fit snugly so I think there wont be an issue when I find something to use it with.
1,Worth not buying it!,"Too much trash. The book gave just an overview, rather than in detail as mentioned in the cover page. I recommend not to pay a single penny."
1,A Miserable Design Defect,"The juicer splatters juice everywhere near it. The little pulp strainer constantly falls off into the juice. It is an ergonomic disaster, since you have to bend your wrist up, push forward, and resist the machine. We're getting a separate juicer and ditching this disaster."
5,Juicer Attachment,My husband enjoys using his KitchenAid Mixer to make stuff with and when he asked for the Juicer Attachment for Father's Day we bought him one. It is easy to use and works great.
3,"Drippy, sticky","I was looking for a quick way to use up my citrus, and this works well-enough, but be prepared to mop the floor afterward. You can fit a glass underneath to catch the juice, but, because of the vertical angle you're working at, juice will also drip down your wrist/arm/elbow and end up on the floor. (Maybe I need a pitcher on the floor to catch that part too.)"
3,very messy,"It gets alot of juice out of the citrus compared to other hand squeezed juicers and citrus press but the juice tends to slide down your wrist and arm. Also holding the citrus up is hard on the wrist and arms, so not a great solution if you like to juice a pitcher worth at a time. The upside is, it's not another small appliance so if you have someone who will juice for you or if you don't juice often, then this product is for you."
2,Very disappointed,"I am very disappointed in the KitchenAid Citrus Juicer Attachment. It is easy to assemble and clean, but the juicing process is very inefficient. I have juice running down my arm because of the angle the orange has to be held against the reamer. In order to maintain adequate pressure on the fruit to maximize juice extraction, the mixer has to be held in place with the other hand. The juicing process is way too slow -- I can hand squeeze almost as fast. The design of the juicer does not seem to take advantage of the power of the machine."
2,If this were 1989,"Not really a ""good"" movie but the premise is pretty interesting. It raises some questions about mankind doing too much with technology. Scientists develop a time machine, and one man uses it to take rich guys back in time for an adventure. Of course something goes wrong and the rest of the movie is spent trying to fix it. Not too bad but nothing to rush to see. If this were 1989 i would say the graphics looked awesome, but since it isn't....... well you get the picture."
1,The innocent must be warned!,"I'm having great difficulty finding the words to describe just how awful this movie was. Only watch it if you're extremely drunk, or if you really like heckling."
1,Deserves zero stars,"Why translate a _great classic_ scifi story by a master like Ray Bradbury if you aren't going to make even a token effort at getting it right? Bradbury's short story is one of THE classic scifi stories, up there with greats by Arthur C. Clarke, Isaac Asimov and even the original god H.G. Wells.This is the kind of movie that makes you wonder how some talent keeps getting work at all, in this case Peter Hyams, who could not have done a worse job. And what fooled the actors into taking a role in this beast.A real bottom dweller. Not good camp. An awful awful awful adaptation. Awful effects.Terrible in every way."
1,DE-EVOLUTION TIME TRAVEL IS REAL...,"Reverse evolution time travel must be true for how else can you explain that Ray Bradbury's charming and clever 1950's story could de-evolve into a such a horrendous mess of a movie. Everything's bad -- acting, filming, effects and so on. Really awful. Foisting this on the public was a crime.Find Bradbury's short story and enjoy the movie in your head and don't pollute your mind with this Peter Hyam's wreck. He owes an apology and money back to everyone who paid to see it. Seriously. If ever a movie was worth filing a class action suit, this is it? Did anyone at the studio watch this abomination before it was released?"
3,Fascinating concept...,"I viewed this movie after reading all the poor reviews. I went in knowing that this DVD was a movie of suspect quality (and man the effects and storyline were very cheezy). I truly enjoy Time Travel movies and love Ray Bradbury short stories very much so I still wanted to give this a chance. I've seen much better effects in ""Made for Cable/TV Movies"". It is UNBELIEVABLE that this had a $52 million dollar budget with only two known actors amongst other obvious reasons (1983 Academy Award winner Ben Kingsley & Edward Burns)!!!???. ""Aeon Flux"" and ""Underworld-Evolution"" had a $50 million budget!!!... I put a few view points down into two categories:Pros* It does keep your interest for the majority of the movie.* Worth while for the concept only (if you enjoy time travel movies).Cons* Poor acting by most of the cast.* Poorly written screenplay.* Cheap special effects.* No bonus features (besides trailers).2+ stars"
1,"The more you think about it, the worse it gets","Don't you hate movies that punish you for paying attention? The problem here isn't that the movie isn't ""scientifically accurate"" (in science fiction, it's perfectly acceptable for the science to be fictious). It's not even that the special effects are poor, or that the acting is cheesy (there's plenty of classic sci-fi that feature both bad effects and bad acting, but still somehow work). No, the problem here is that good speculative fiction still needs some level of internal logic. The script for this film utterly lacks that.It must also be noted that this is a truly sub-par DVD as well. There are no special features unless you count the two theatrical trailers. Rent it if you must, but do not buy this disc."
5,Kitchenaid KHM7T 7-Speed Ultra Power Plus Hand Mixer,"I thought my old hand mixer, which I received as a wedding gift in 1974, was fine. Hey, it lasted longer than my marriage did! Unfortunately, I broke it while making sticky icing for my sister's birthday cake. My new kitchenAid 7-speed mixer is so much more powerful, not to mention quieter. I can still hear the T.V. while I'm mixing up a cake. It is great for cookies too. Due to the design of the beaters, the batter doesn't get stuck in them like it did on my old mixer. I am very happy with my new mixer, and I would definitely purchase another one if it holds up half as long as my old one did."
5,The Best In Hand Mixer Class,"This hand-held mixer is a great compromise if you don't require a heavy-duty stand design. It's modererately priced and is a ""quality"" product from ""KitchenAid"". The motor though, isn't quite as heavy-duty as you'll find in stand mixers. Very heavy batters or bread dough might pose a challenge for any hand-held model but it's a fraction of the price of the stand mixers. This one will meet the needs of the majority of families most of the time. It is available in eight color choices, including black and white. I rated it five stars because, it's probably the best hand-held mixer in that overall class of product. Lots of ""speed"" settings from which to select and made by a company that has stood the ""test of time"" and stands behind their products."
5,Perfect Hand Mixer!,"This KitchenAid hand mixer is a must! It is perfect, I use it all the time to mix cake batter, cookie dough (with the dough beaters), eggs, brownie mix and pancake mix. It always gets the job done quickly and easily. The digital LED allows you to easily see the speed you are mixing at and to increase or decrease the speed all you do is touch the up or down button. It has an on off switch in addition to the stop/start buttons to prevent any accidents. I love my 5 quart KitchenAid Artisan stand mixer but I have to admit I use this hand mixer 10 times more often! It is very easy to clean and worth every penny."
2,Should have listened to the other reviewers.,"I was in the middle of doing a wedding cake, 3 batches of buttercream and more to go and the gears start to grind. Had to go back to using my Kitchen Aid Stand mixer and a $10.00 toast master I'd used for 6 years. I do like the design and the digital read out of the speeds, as well as the sensitivity of the speed increments. Quality control awful."
1,country of manufacture,"Amazon lists the country of manufacture as the USA. The information is false. I called to confirm and discovered that Kitchen Aid manufactures this product in China, a country that floods the world market with products manufactured in forced labor camps. Moreover, given the cost of labor in China, it seems that Kitchen Aid charges a PREMIUM for this product. Braun, on the other hand, manufactures their hand mixers in Spain--a country with laws against slave labor."
1,Kichenaid could not have test this!!,"Kitchenaid should be embarrassed! This grinder simply doesn't work. The meat doesn't feed through well. The meat jams up and you have to take the entire thing apart every few minutes. It took me over 1/2 hour to grind up 1 pound of chicken tonight. Aargh! This product is cheap, cheap, cheap. Kitchenaid's reputation is suspect now."
4,needs improvement,"I am a retired butcher. I see 1 flaw with this grinder, as you grind meat with it if you don't hold your hand over the blades as you grind the meat,the meat shoots all over the place.I e-mailed Kitchen aid and they said they would look into the problem.All that is needed is a shield to go over the head of it. I use a plastic bag tied around the neck of it and it works. But if more people let Kitchen aid know they want it they will make an a shield for it."
2,Inadequate,"Got it yesterday and tested it with about a pound and a half of pork butt. The best thing that I could say about it is that it is possible to grind a pound of ground meat as long as you have two people and at least an hour to spare.It took 40 minutes to grind it and we had to take it apart and clean it three times. Any silver skin, tendon or fat immediately clogs the grinder.Even with already ground meat, it is excruciatingly slow.It would be one thing if it came free with the Kitchen Aid. It does not.We also got the black grease in the meat that has been often commented on. Finally, we can hear the motor straining and I'm quite sure that if we were to grind another five pounds of meat it would burn the motor out.The cutter is not sharp, at all. It's a joke actually. Ditto for the stomper.Poor design, poor materials and poor ergonomics.Returning it today. We will buy a dedicated grinder."
2,Leaves Residue In Food,"This device grinds food just fine.... BUT it leaves a small amount of gray-black residue in the food. This comes from where the grinder plate wears against the metal shaft. As the food is pressed past, it picks up the residue.If you are not watching, it is easy to overlook as it soon gets mixed in with the rest of the freshly ground food, but it is clearly there.The customer service people told me that this residue is ""harmless"" but I have had a hard time getting comfortable feeding my family a metal residue in their food. I end up picking it out, but that is labor intensive and takes all of the fun out of using this machine.I have tried adding a small amount of food-safe lubricant, but that makes the problem worse. I have also tried cleaning the parts and adjusting the tightness and the grind speed."
2,OK product,"Works OK, easy to attach to the Mixer and easy to be cleaned.However, some ""dirty"" staff comes out after grinding a little while. The problem is the dark color staff comes from the frictions of grinding plate and knife that users have no control of."
2,Very disappointed!,"Grinder plates and blade do not fit tightly together. Because of this, thin membranes get wrapped around grinding blade and must be cleaned off or meat cannot push through. If meat is thoroughly trimmed works great, otherwise it's a pain to use."
4,Grind your hamburger,"Using the Food Grinder to make hamburger makes a better, taster ground beef patty. When done the grinder can be washed in the dishwasher for a easy clean up."
4,Fine grindings,The grinder attachment for the Kitchen Aid mixer is a well made and useful tool. We ground 20 pounds of Tri-tip into chili meat and were very impressed with the ease of operation and ease of clean up. If you take your time to cut pieces that will fit easily into the hopper tube then the rest of the job will be easy.
3,Not thrilled with this product,"I purchased this product locally after researching it extensively.I had the following problems: The meat was very, very slow to grind. Took approximately 20 min to grind 3 small boneless pork ribs. i had tried small chunks and long thin strips.I am disabled and sit in a power chair while cooking. The food tray was higher than my head and that made it hard to use. I will have to put the entire mixer on a lower table to use this attachment in the future.The plastic pusher gets greasy and hard to hold on to very quickly.I had the problem with the meat squishing out arount the rim as another poster mentioned.The texture of the meat was more like mush than ground. Just out of curiosity, I ran some previously cooked steak through and the grind looked like what I had expected the pork to look like."
1,Disappointing,"Purchased this grinder to cut down the time it takes to mince beef heart for use in a 'fish food' recipe (to feed tropical fish). Unfortunately, unless you are grinding several pounds of meat, nothing comes out of the grinder. (Plenty of 'semi-ground' meat remains in the grinder.) This grinder has so much space in it that the food can cycle around and around inside the grinder without ever coming out. I also tried it with 8 frozen raw shrimp. Nothing came out. I opened the grinder and took it apart in order to get the ground shrimp.I had better success with a hand grinder. The amount of work spent grinding a pound of beef heart is what made me want to try this mixer attachment. It doesn't work as well as the hand grinder."
2,"Poor product, so disappointed....","I bought this in hopes to be able to save money and grind my own meat. I was surprised when I tried to grind up some chicken. It turned it to scary looking mush that I could barely get to come out of the thing. When I tried to push the meat down it instead came out of top instead. When I turned up the speed it started coming out the sides of the grinder plate. The next time I tried grinding up bread crumbs. This was just as bad or worse. It got jammed and clumped together. I followed all instructions for each of these things. Seriously, how hard can bread crumbs be? Apparently quite hard for this KitchenAid attachment. It seems to be made well and sturdy but that's about it. It sucks! What a waste of money!!! It now sits on a shelf in my cupboard unused."
2,Used it for stuffing sausages.,"I bought this grinder to make sausages at home. I'm not happy at all with this grinder. The meat must be 100% lean so the fat won't get stuck in the little holes and clog it. The blade is not sharp enough in order to cut through the fat. Also to make sausages you need the plate with bigger holes. It takes a very long time so I just took the meat to the restaurant to grind it and just stuffed the sausages at home, but that also took hours."
3,Great for grinding meat!,"I bought this for my husband for a Christmas present. He loves it. He is an avid eater of burgers and he uses this to grind up steak, bacon and sausage to make his own special burgers. It's simple to use and easy to clean. We use it every couple of weeks."
1,poisonous meat!!!,"As others have said, the blades are shaving off metal from the grind disc and mixing it with your meat. Totally unacceptable."
1,Metal dust in food!,"After using it for over a year, I was compelled to write a review about the metal dust problem!no matter how much I clean, it always produces black metal dust in the food! this should not allowed to be sold! having metal poison in my food mix is not safe and people should consider twice before purchasing this unit!See the picture I've uploaded and see it for yourself.Also, see the discussion titled ""gray greas looking ooz"" below this page to see more people having the same problem."
2,It is not really hard steel and it is not one size fits all.,"1:The blade is not made of real steel and not that sharp you would expected.2:I had to made a new hole on it in order to fit my 4 and 1/2quart mixer, other wise it will come loose when it is grindingfood."
1,Junk. Plain and simple.,No meat grinder should be made with a plastic housing. The housing cracks after a few uses. The blade is made of a cheap alloy or possibly aluminum. There is a constant flow of metal shavings when you grind meat. Grease leaks from the joint of the worm. This is the most useles piece of junk on the market. I wish Kitchenaid would get over their greed and make a QUALITY product like they used to...
1,Dreadful,"Followed the instructions assiduously. Also followed instructions carefully as written in book ""Charcuterie"" by Michael Rulman. Its well understood that one has to minimize how much gristle/fibrous material is fed into the grinder. This thing won't work if there's a piece of fat in the next county! It wants 100% lean only. It doesn't work for you, you work for it. What a fabulous waste of time. Oh, by the way, the leakage of black graphite lubricant that someone posted on this site? Its true: A)it can't grind meat, and B) it leaks graphite lubricant on to your food. It'll be fun trying to get a refund."
1,set screw does not fit mixer,I purchased a refurbished artisan mixer in Dec 2003. I am totally happy with the mixer. I asked for the food grinder for Christmas. The food grinder works very well but the set screw that attaches it to the mixer does not fit properly. I exchanged the food grinder only to have the same problem. Kitchenaid sent a new housing and it also does not fit properly. On one occasion my mixer fell over because the food grinder and mixer did not fit together properly. Kitchenaid is now sending me a new mixer. Hopefully this will resolve the problem.
4,Easy to Use!,"I was very happy with the KitchenAid food grinder. I was even happier to find out that the main components are dishwasher safe in the top rack! I feel safer knowing that the parts are thoroughly cleaned in the dishwasher, especially since I bought this to grind my own meat. My husband hunts and we cut up the deer meat last Fall and put it in small Zipper bags before freezing the meat. I use the meat as I need it and wanted to grind some of the meat to make chili, meatloaf and other dishes where I would normally use ground beef. The instruction suggest grinding the meat twice, but I didn't and it was small enough to cook like hamburger. Since I already own the mixer, I thought this was a good buy instead of buying a separate grinder. Good choice; lives up to the KitchenAid name."
1,Warning,"Warning: this product contains a chemical known to the State of California to cause cancer, birth defects or other reproductive harm."
4,"Sleek Phone, lacks some items....","This phone has a really great ""cool factor"" and the screen, and camera are both very good. My reception is only so-so. However, the main problem with the phone is the battery! The life is really bad and you should plan on charging it alot. Also, the buttons are really hard to get at sometimes, as they are quite slippery! Another bad feature is that the thing can play MP3's but because it only takes Memory Stick Duo, it can only play 128 megs of songs! Thats really not going to do anybody that much good. If you are looking for a really sleek looking phone with a nice quality camera, then this phone should be at the top of your list. Everyone else, however, who is looking for quality and battery life among other things, keep looking!"
4,Kinda like a Chubby Hubby...,"I was looking for a phone that would do quite nearly everything, and was hoping that the Sony Ericsson S710a was going to be the new baby to do just that.I liked the fact that it was a phone, PDA and quickie camera all-in-one. The screen, sounds, menus and decent camera make the S710a an overall decent choice for beginners. As for myself and for the heavy-duty user, the fact that it works with both Macs and PCs made me squeal like a schoolgirl.All in all, electronically, it works like a dream... but, it's kinda like squeezing a giant candy bar into a ""bite-size"" pocket. To put it mildly, it's a zaftig phone. Ok, I'll say it, this is probably the chubbiest phone I own as well as it being a swivel phone (really akward). I didn't think anyone made a swivel anymore.This is a diamond in the rough... awesome features, superior sound and world service. Of course, if size is a bit of an issue, this could be a Chunky Monkey."
5,we won't be hearing this good song from scotland very soon,"To be honest with you i think that Belle and Sebastian almost chocked themselves sometime in 1997. Well, to go from the start this, Tigermilk, is their best record ever. The follow up If You're Feeling Sinister, is well, quite just as good, ie mind blowing. Unfortunatly they haven't continue in that direction after the summer eps of 1997. I don't have a clue what happened, Stuart Murdoch, obviously lost the control of the band he no longer to write all the songs and not produce the records. The Boy With The Arab Strap was not a complete failur, but I can not deny I was disapointed. First I thought it was a part of their evolvement (letting Isobel and Stevie do hard work labour), but unfortunatly their new songs (family tree and winter wooskielf) are very much still that way. If you never heard Belle and Sebastian before, buy Tigermilk, If You're Feeling Sinister or the Dog On Wheels EP and you will never in this life be disapointed..."
1,UNBELIEVABLE...,"...in the negative way, that is. This CD is amateur hour for sure. With the group's totally overrated sense of melody, instrumental chops, and weak out-of-key vocals, I am absolutely puzzled by the amount of critical acclaim heaped on these guys. I bought the CD and immediately took it back, and debated the merits of this pathetic group of musicians with the salesperson that recommended it to me. BTW, I'm complimenting Belle and Sebastian by even referring to them as a group of musicians."
5,Tom Sawyer a must read,Tom Sawyer was a great book.It had an interesting plot.It displays the life of a young boy and his friends.Twain really outdid himself with this one with the life-like characters who display a wide variety of dialects and unfold their personalities in this adventurous classic.Tom goes through his young life quarelling and socializing with other peers.Twain uses his vivid imagination in this story to create a picture in the readers mind of what life was like in the 1800s.Twain also uses the humor and character of his time to write a story that young readers will love. You will be glad that you read this book and hopefully want to read it again.I know I do.
5,TOM SAWYER,I loved this book I am in 2nd grade bur I did not have trouble reading it I strongly recomend this book
3,The story is great. The Kindle edition...not so much,"Reading the book again after all these years is fascinating and fun.However, it is very difficult to read it because the format is old and not suitable for my reader. I thought that maybe this is because I used an online reader, but I found from other reviews that this is indeed an issue for kindle owners as well. A pity."
3,tom sawyer,The Adventures of Tom Sawyer by Mark Twain. The town where Tom lives is Hannibal which is on the banks of the Mississippi river.Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn are the main characters in this story.something that Tom and Huck see in the graveyard which gives them lots of problems.I thought the the book was ok but it lacked seriousness and i gave it one and a half thumbs up
4,Tom Sawyer,"I've recently read the book ""The Adventures of Tom Sawyer"". It was a fantastic book. It was a halarious book. Tom, the main character, was mischievious and was the kind of hustler that could sell you a house seven times then tell you that you still have to build it. The most interesting part of the story was when they went down the river and became pirates.He fakes his own death and attends his own funeral. He has a frightening adventure in a cave with his friend Becky Thatcher and get lost then chased by a killer. Then when his friend Huck Finn joins up the trouble doubles. Tom Sawyer hates being bord so he makes his life fun and exciting for everyone!"
1,Great book -kindle version is horrid,I won't write about the quality of the book itself ... that is covered everywhere and it is a GREAT piece of literature.This review is for the Kindle version of the book - HORRID.No matter what I do it does not appear correctly on the Kindle. See the review before mine and you will understand.Unfortunately this was the very first book I purchased for my new Kindle.
5,This classic never get's old.,"Yes it's a scanned book, but well done and the story itself keeps me entertained every time- like an old I Love Lucy show, it may be black and white, but the acting is always supreme."
2,The adventures of Tom Sawyer should get 5 stars or 10 stars. Mark twain.,"He is cool but finds out he's not so sure that he is cool anymore and that he is wrong. Love, Alexis a. Hopper."
2,In a word: BORING,"This book is one of the most boring, overrated books in American literature. It's moderately entertaining as an adventure yarn, but overall it's very dull."
4,"good, good ,good","One of my favorite books is TOM SAWYER. The author is Mark Twain, he wrote this along time ago around the late eighteen hundreds.He was a very famous author for his time.The story took place in Hannible Missouri in the late eighteen hundreds. The story is about a boy Tom Sawyer who witness something that someone might hang for, or will Tom tallthe truthabout what happened that night."
2,Abbreviated book kills Tom Sawyer's Spirit,"Tom Sawyer is one of the most beloved characters in American literature. How could you allow anybody to tamper with the awesome quality of that naughty little boy? Are you trying to make him a military school graduate? Please think twice, before you put out such ""a cut and dry"" version of Mark Twain's classic book!"
4,Classic tale,Story is great but this version does not have the illustrationsMary twain was a master story teller. Must read
5,Good book,"I loved following along on all of the adventures that Tom Sawyer took me on in this book, felt like I was right there."
4,Remember old memories,"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer is a great,fun,challenging novel. Adults need to be reminded of their childhood and remember the crazy things they used to do. Children should read this book because Tom does things they can only dream of. Their are many aspects you will enjoy about this novel.The story of Tom Sawyer is about crazy fun adventures. Tom is a misunderstood child who is tricky and sly like when he gave his cat painkillers. He tricked kids into giving him things so they could they paint the fence he was punished to paint. He also witnesses a murder and nearly gets killed for it. There are many more adventures that he goes on with his friends like Huck. The excitement never ends.I learned that we must cherish our childhood, for it is merely a waning period in our short life. Thank you Mark Twain for showing me that I must enjoy everyday."
3,Engrossing at times but hardly amusing.,"Everyone might be wondering why I rated a classic a 3 star book. The reason for this is because it is not consistent. At one point, you're very happy and the next your not. Plus, Mark Twain's sense of humor is appalling. Is it really so funny that a cat is given a dose of painkiller and bounces off the wall? If you ask me, they should make it a Non classic if there was really such a thing."
2,It's a wonder Mark Twain made any money from this book. Maybe his customers were just plain stupid.,"The first, (and hopefully last) time I read this book was for a school assignment over the past couple of months. The first couple of chapters use this exact layout:1: Tom does something stupid2: Tom lies to his aunt about the aforementioned stupid thing3: His aunt believes his lie about the aforementioned stupid thing4: His half brother Sid (Great name by the way) rats on him.5: Tom gets yelled at and gets his friends to do his menial chores.The first chapter is fun to read, but after you find out that Mark Twain is just using a ""Making Chapters for Dummies"" book to help him write Tom Sawyer, that just sucks the fun away from it.It's a wonder that Mark Twain made any money off this book, or Maybe his customers were just plain stupid. Maybe they just bought the book out of pity for him and in hope that he would write a better book."
3,Interesting,"The book was above average. The beginning starts off as a real bore, which could be a problem for trying to catch the interest of a fifthteen-year old. As the plot thickens over time, it gradually gets more interesting with nail-biting dramatic scenes waiting to take place. As interesting as it does sound, I would not recommend this to a friend because the beginning is so boring that it would turn the reader away disgust (which has happened to me before)."
3,tom and huck,"It was different than what I remembered. I first read it in the sixth grade and really enjoyed it and then saw Tom and Huck from Disney and also good. My last impression was that of the movie that when I came back years later (16 years later) to finally re-read this classic I found many things missing. Of course I had the movie implanted in my memory more than the book itself. Nonetheless it did not take away from the book, if anything it enhanced it as it allowed me to revisit Tom's world. Enjoyable book but one that does not be revisited as often. Will still recommend of course."
4,"Danielle's ""Pick...""","I think this book was the best book for reading counts because the characters are funny and some of them get into alot of trouble. I like the way the author writes the story. He makes the characters sound interesting and the situations that they are in don't sound boring. I think if people don't like to read as mush as other people do, they will enjoy this book. In this story, there is a boy named Tom Sawyer , who gets really gullable people to do his work for him. He also gets himself into alot of trouble. For example, Tom and his friends went to an island and they decided not to return home. Their family was getting worried and they were searching for them all over the town. Soon they asumed that they were dead. On the day of the funeral they returned, and of course, they got into alot of trouble. I reccomend this book because it is exciting and adventerous. You will really like this book!"
2,I never read this version before.,Not formatted very well for Kindle.. Strange charts and lists of chapters and sections were very confusing. I must have read a children's version years ago.
3,The adventures of Tom Sawyer,"I havent read the book yet, but I have heard that it is very good. And it was a free download."
4,Classic Story,"I have always loved the story, it was great to be able to read a classic tale and fall in love with the characters all over again."
3,get an unabridged version,"The thought police emasculated Twain's classic in this edition. Why can't such people leave his versions alone, ones that are accurate portrayals of the times in which he lived in and wrote of?"
1,Not formated properly for the Kindle,"Both this book and the Unabridged Huckleberry Finn sufferthesame problem in that they are not formatted properly fortheKindle. You don't see proper paragraphs, it was set upfor apage with a wider margin and the line breaks are hardcodedso what you get is an entire book broken up just likewhatyou see here.Which is very annoying to read. I tried changing thefontsizes as well as the line spacing and the page orientationbut wasunable to get the pages to view properly. I called AmazonKindleCustomer Service about this since it isn't just a few typosbut theentire book that is this way & told them I wanted a refund,whichthey said they would do but I still haven't gotten thatconfirmationemail from them yet. Yeah, it's only a dollar but it is moreaboutthe principle of the matter, doesn't anyone proof thesebeforethey go on sale? Apparently no one bothered to look atthesetwo books on a Kindle."
1,Abridged volume,"I will make this short and sweet. This is not Mark Twain. Someone has dumbed down the story, apparently for readers who are not ready to handle the unabridged version. I did not know this when I ordered it, and I was extremely disappointed. That's possibly my fault. But I cannot recommend this to anyone who wants to read Mark Twain."
2,Great story but a bad read for younger generation,"This November 2011 publications was decribed as ""a beautifully-designed new edition of Mark Twain's classic THE ADVENTURES OF TOM SAWYER"" and it was far from new, IMO. Based upon this statement, the publication date and the new'ish looking cover, I thought this may be a good read for a 6th grader. I was wrong.I wanted my son to read some of the classic adventures, which The Adventures of Tom Sawyer clearly qualifies. I was hoping it would be an easier read, with vocabulary that a most modern day kids could understand. I read the 1st few chapters only to be disappointed. I knew right away this ""new edition"" would not register well with a middle school aged child.A fabulous story but not a good read for the younger generation."
3,This book,"This book is pretty good, interesting.I probaly wouldn't buy this brand new, I wouldn't search for it, but thats my opinion. if I saw this book at a used book store I'd buy it. this book is very adventurous. I'd recomend this book to be checked out at a library. Its pretty good."
4,One Thumb Up,The Adventures of Tom Sawyer is an okay novel. I would recomend this book to kids and adults that have ahigh reading level because it yha s a lot of tough words and slag words. This book also has a different way of speaking. I would also recomend this book to people that like adventure books.Tom Sawyer is a boy in the 1830's who is very goog at geting away with things he has done. He goesz opn adventures with his friends. Tom was awitness to a murder. He gets stuck in a cave with Becky Thacher. He triks his friends into white washing his fence and gives his cat painkellers. Out opf all of the adventures Tom went on the most execting one was the ones with Injunn Joe.I have learned a few things from this book. One thing I learned is that kids need to be kids. Also I learned what it is like to live in the 1830s. This book taught me so much.
2,A two star book,I would not reccomend this book to anyone I know. I think it's a boring and lousy book. I did not enjoy it at all. There is nothing a reader can get out of it. Mark twain just rambles on and on. If you're going to read this book don't be surprised if it's horrible.Tom Sawyer is a book about a 12 year old boys adventures. It takes place in the late 1800s. The main thing that happens is the murder of Dr. Robbinson. Also tom has many schemes and tricks. But a lot of Tom's attention is drawn to Becky Thatcher.All I learned is that Tom is a average boy who just wants to have fun all day. All though he's not a great exampkle for kids. I would not give this book a high rating. On a scale of 1 to 5 stars I would give it a 2.
2,Sarah's Review,"This book was great. Even though I have not yet finished it, I am more than half way done and I love it! I have to read it for school, but I'm taking it as a joy ride!!!!!!! Thank you, Mark Twain, for this WONDERFUL book."
4,Pretty cool book,It's cool it has adventure and action even a bit of romance too! Random words random words to meet repuirements
1,Had to read for English class,This book is dumb. People can never seem to speak proper English. I wouldn't read this book again if I were dying of boredom.
4,Good times,"Reminds me of my childhood. The mischevious boy tries to out wit his aunt and andvetures the countryside. It is a solid read, make sure you don't miss out."
4,OLD CLASSIC,Interesting to read and compare to the TV version. Also interesting to observe how Dickens could use language and convey feelings and subtle humour. A worthwhile exercise for anyone interested in literature and language.
4,Fun Book,"I never read this growing up, so it was fun to finally pick it up now that I'm just shy of 40. It was a bit hard to get started, and there are so many references to things that just don't make sense in today's world. But setting aside things that I didn't understand, I was still able to enjoy the book, and I'm glad I decided to stick with it till the end."
5,Tom Sawyer,"I really enjoyed reading this book again, after many decades! Though it is a story about boys ... perhaps for boys ... Mark Twain was a master story teller. I recommend this book for all readers! It remains a well-written tale ... dbr"
4,The Adventures of Tom Sawyer by Mark Twain,The reading made want to come back as soon as possible to Finnish the book. I have been taking the bus lately due to the price of gas and thought that while spending an hour on the bus I would have time to read. This was my second Tom Sawyer book I read since taking the bus.
4,Good good bok,"I really liked The adventures of Tom sawyer, it was a good book. It is writing by Mark Twain. It talkes about all the adventures that Tom was having. That is why I like it, because I like to go on adventure, but not as exceting as Tom's."
2,?,"It's a classic I know, but I just couldn't follow the country dialouge. Seeing the movie, the story itself is good. But in the book it is soo hard to understand and doesn't.....flow. Maybe it is just me? It's a classic, but I didn't like it. I recomend the book."
1,Scam,I was planning a trip with my 5 children and we were excited to listen to the tapes.It was a disaster. Some of the tapes were broken and others were taped over with pop music.I could not wait to throw them away.I will never buy used from Amazan again.
5,Excellent-very good bedtime childrens reading,"Selected favorites of this collection are ""A boy and his Stomach"", ""A bear Story"", ""The Mothers Watch"". Great down to earth type poetry. Easy to read and understand.Recommend for all ages"
4,Wish I had bought this mixer sooner.,"I really like this appliance. I have arthritis and kneading and mixing by hand cause a lot of fatigue. Even holding a hand mixer can be hard to hold. I have been making bread dough now. Mixing batches of cookies is fast. What a time saver. Very easy to wash bowl, attachments and wipe down standing mixer. It is heavy which is good, it stays in place while being operated. It also was shipped and delivered in a timely manner which was greatly appreciated. Happy with this purchase."
2,wimpy,The Classic worked fine when I was making pizza dough once a week with 2 cups flour but when I started using it weekly to knead bread dough with 5 cups flour it started leaking grease/oil. Not up to the task.
2,over priced for the quality,"I have owned my mixer for 14 months and it quit on Thanksgiving Day. For the price, the quality doesn't match. I found out it has a nylon gear in the beater gear system and that gear was stripped, therefore the mixer would run but not rotate the beaters. They would not cover it under the warranty because it was 2 months over, neither would they sell you the nylon gear alone, but you have to buy the stack assembly of gears (...). If it only lasts a year this is not a good buy."
1,Tsk tsk to those of you writing reviews on 15-30 year old kitchen-aid mixers,"The new models are not like the old ones! All my friends have replaced theirs or complain about it constantly (one friend's fell off the counter from making bread the first time she used it.). You should not be able to give a 5 star review on a product that may have changed company hands or gone downhill since you bought it 100 years ago as this creates a false sense of security for those shopping them! I have the original k-45 and it's great! I mean, it's an ugly color but I got it on ebay 7 years ago and it still runs great! You can still get bowls or tools for it from kitchen-Aid. I love mine but glad I don't have to buy a new one. THIS product, however, does not deserve 5 stars!"
5,KitchenAid magic,"I have long lusted after a KitchenAid, and when I saw the great price on Amazon I had to get it and just love it. It was a snap to order and it's so easy to use."
3,Leanna Z. Don't use for bread!!!,"I received this mixer as a wedding gift. Overall, I like it a lot. It's a powerful machine and does a great job for many tasks. However, I would not recommend it for making bread dough. The fourth time I used it for making bread dough, the dough hook snapped in two pieces. Furthermore, every time I used the machine for bread, the bowl got jammed into the base and it was impossible for me to get it off. After several minutes of using full force, my husband finally got it off the base. When I called customer service about this problem, they told me that this sort of thing happens all the time and suggested putting the machine on the floor so you can use your entire body to forcefully get the bowl off the base. Sounds ridiculous to me. Something this expensive shoudn't be so difficult to use."
1,"Cheap mixer, no longer reliable","My 14 yr old kitchenaid mixer's motor blew, so I decided to purchase another kitchenaid mixer. I found the higher end mixer had several complaints so I decided to stay with the kitchenaid classic. Two weeks later, while creaming room temperature butter and sugar, the gears broke. Obviously the gears are still being made of plastic or very cheap metal! For the price of the mixer, it should last longer than 2 weeks. I emailed the company, doubt I will receive a response!! I am telling all my friends to stay away from kitchenaid mixers!"
2,Warning - read product details and go for the upgraded model!,"I ordered this as a gift for my daughter, thinking it was like the one I have had for 10 years. I didn't realize that the bowl does not have a handle, plus the low wattage leaves a lot to be desired for mixing basic things like thick cookie dough. With the handled bowl being so expensive as a separate order item, - and you WILL want the handle -it's worth it to just get the 450 watt model with the handled bowl and pouring shield."
5,Kitchen AId Mixer,I bought this mixer as a gift for someone else. I already own a similar one and love it and I wanted to share this quality mixer.
5,I LOVE IT!!!!,"I wanted one of these for years and finally got myself one. I use it almost everyday and I just love, it's the best mixer I've ever used.I'm very happy that I bought it, it's a great mixer!"
2,Not for heavy duty use...,"I use this machine primarily for kneading bread dough, one loaf at a time. It is barely able to accomplish the job: at higher speeds it will dance right off the counter if you don't restrain it, the pivot pin that holds the head to the base tends to work its way out making it possible for the head to fall off, the bowl which is held in place by a tapered friction fit around the bottom rim becomes so tight that it almost can't be removed from the machine - I have to place the entire machine on the floor and hold it down with my feet so I can wrench it loose with both hands....it's just not a good bread machine! For the lighter duty tasks like those you might use a good hand held mixer for it works very well...."
4,kitchen aid k45ss mixer,"this is an wonderful machine, perfect for the average household, with 3 kids it meets my needs. i would recommend this"
5,Nice Gift,"I own this same mixer and love it. Purchased this one as a birthday gift for a daughter. I've owned mine for about four years and love it the most when making double batches of cookie dough, or using the dough hook to knead bread. A great mixer!!"
5,Kitchenaid Classic 4 1/2 Qt. Stand Mixer,"I am very pleased with this product. Even though it was more than I wanted to spend, it seemed a bargain compared with spending $100 on another product that may or may not work. We have made a very sticky batter with this mixer, and it handled it fine. Other households in our extended family also have been happy with this product."
5,Another Great Finish!,"What can I say, Nora has done it again. She has beautifully depicted the lives of the people involved with In The Garden. I couldn't wait to get this final installment and see just how Hayley's story turned out and I have to say that Nora did it just right. Of course as with all of her trilogies I didn't want it to end, but it was a nice finish to a beautiful set. Highly Recommended!!"
5,Had to have it,"I couldn't wait to get my hands on this book, Hailey was not my favorite character from this series, but after reading it the second time around I gave her a little more credit, I didn't like that she whined so much, I know that it wasn't exactly her fault due to Amelia, but it was really annoying. If I didn't want to see how the story played out I totally would have skipped it, but that's just me. Woe is me is not my line, and the people that use it get on my nerves."
2,*Yawns*,"This was so hard to get into. I didn't feel any connection between the two main characters. I didn't feel anything for anyone, in fact. In this book, Roberts didn't really go into how any of the characters were feeling. The only part in the whole book that had emotion was the prologue. From then on, it was just...flat. It was more like watching things happening. People talking. Doing things. But there was no passion or anything. The romantic relationship and the plot were not really write well together. I sometimes had no idea what they were talking about when the subject of the ghost and the history came up, because they were so vague with what they said."
5,Red Lily,"I am a big Nora Roberts fan. I even have her very first novel! I had previously owned this book in paperback and read it so many times, I broke the binding and lost half of the pages, so when I saw I could get a hard back inexpensively, I just had to do it. Red Lily is exciting with a little suspense thrown in for good measure. As always, there is a happy ending."
3,Aren't Hayley and Harper cousins???,"I liked the first two in the trilogy and am about to start Red Lily - yes, I haven't even read it. But it's a romance and not exactly hard to guess the plot.Aren't Harper and Hayley cousins though? Ick! I'm going to try to make my way through Red Lily and I am going to read reviews to see if I can find something that makes this not true. But isn't anyone else concerned she is going to date a relative???"
