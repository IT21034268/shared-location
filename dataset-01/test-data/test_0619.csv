4,A Style Guide for the Christian Writer,"Leonard G. Goss and Carolyn Stanford Goss address the unique problems faced by Christian writers in ""The Little Style Guide to Great Christian Writing and Publishing.""Each section of the book is cross referenced to the ""Chicago Manual of Style, Fifteenth Edition."" The authors feel the CMS is essential to all writers.I consider this compact comprehensive guide an important edition to my personal Christian writing reference and resource library.Indispensable."
3,Writing Resource,It is a simple book that gives some insight on christian writing and publishing. I felt it covered more on the writing aspects than publishing. Editing resource too.
4,nikon binoculars,I have always had good luck with Nikon products. So far I am happy with the binoculars. The real test will be next winter in the cold. I'm pretty confident they will do what I expect from them.
5,These are fantastic!,"Bought these based on other sterling reviews so knew these would be good, but was astonished at how well they work in very low light conditions! If you're still considering, just get them....you won't be disappointed! Amazing performance for the price!"
5,Best hat ever.,"No other hat in the world beats the Franchise for comfort. And, this one has a tiger paw on it, which increases its greatness factor by a lot. You must own this hat!"
5,Excellent,"Coaching Yourself to Leadership is a fantastic guide and self-study that has helped me recognize my true potential as a leader. This well-organized guide and workbook is an easy read with real, practical suggestions that I can apply to my life today. Excellent!"
1,"""Like a Stone"" a good track, but.................","The two unreleased tracks (We Got The Whip/Gasoline-Live) are the same tracks offered on the ""Cochise"" single. I Love Audioslave, but this is a rip-off. Put some different tracks on it and then I'll buy it. There is no reason to purchase this CD single for those that already own the album."
5,Terrific kayak trips resource for paddlers of all levels!,"We referred to this book time and time again and found accurate, precise information regarding Lake Michigan and Superior paddle trips. Guided us to many accesible sites that represents the true nature of both lakes, from sandy beaches to rocky shores. An accurate guidance of what skill level should attempt each trip. Great book to use as a guide to map a vacation. Also good information regarding restuarants and camping spots."
4,Solid Package,"You will like their approach to teaching you a new language. I cannot say that it is better than the Rosetta stone but it is closer than what the price difference would make you believe.Like any other package, it is not going to teach you the material by osmosis, you are going to have to put the time and effort to go through the CD's and the exercises, but if you do, you will get your money's worth."
1,Terrible!!,"Are the creators of this software FOR REAL??? Think you'll learn French with this junk? Think again! The first---the FIRST lesson makes you recognize French SENTENCES you've NEVER even heard before that have never even been explained prior. And get this, some of the menu labels are in French! The help button does not work. You have to exit the the program to get to the PDF help file. I can't even figure out what most of the exercises are for!Junk!"
3,Falls apart,I purchased all of the dolls for my 4 year old. I am constantly putting the head and leg back on these dolls. Mercury being the worst of them all.
2,The great Gilly Hopkins,"Two of the reasons I did like this book are because it has a suprise ending,and because Gilly learns to be nice.Two reasons that I didn't like the book are that it was boring, and she says bad words."
3,One Tough Cookie,The Great Gilly Hopkins is a great book. Gilly is an eleven year old foster child. She wants to find her mom and have a home of her home. Gilly goes to live with Maime Trotter and William Ernest. Maime Trotter is a kind foster mother. William Ernest is a young boy that is a foster child. He likes Sesame Street. One day Gilly's grandmother shows up and her whole life changes. I think what the author is trying to say is that sometimes what you want isn't always best for you. I liked this book because it was entertaining.Read this book to find out what happens next!
4,"A ""real life"" novel about family, self-knowledge, and coping with grief","None of eleven-year-old Gilly Hopkins' foster families can measure up to the photograph of her beautiful, distant mother. At least that's what Gilly tells herself while she's torturing family after would-be family. But when she finally finds herself in the home of a woman who may just be prepared to love her the way she is, Gilly has to decide if she really wants to be part of a family at all.The Great Gilly Hopkins is a story about love, hope, and not always getting what we want. It was a Newberry Honor book in 1979."
1,YUCK!,"This book is one of the worst books I have ever read in my whole life. The main character is a jerk, the ending is bad, and the plot is pathetic. Don't waste your time on it. Please."
5,Perfect accessory to my daughters Amelia Earhart costume - Well made!,"They were great, well made and will easily be used for other costumes! They looked so great, even better in person."
5,This is the BEST All Around Cleaner,"I've used everything - and I mean everything - to clean around the house and when I first tried Crazy Clean I was hooked. Unfortunately, the only store in my area that sold it no longer does and I have to order it from Amazon. Sprayway also makes an excellent glass cleaner. The orange scent for this all purpose cleaner is not over powering. When you spray the product and wipe it off, the dirt will be gone and there is no residue. It is not harmful to surfaces and really shines them nicely. I can't recommend this product more highly. You won't regret trying it. You can use three cans of this for about one year on your kitchen, bathrooms, etc. It's quite economical."
1,very poor albulm,"to tell u the truth.. necro is not that great. i feel honestly now that if necro would jus be a producer he'd be better off. he does make some ill beats but his raps are almost hurried. if u ever heard a necro song that was good it was good. but when he's bad he's really bad. i feel like if he sat now and really listened to his own rymes he might consider jus be a producer. if i could give this a 0 i would. i dont enjoy this albulm at all. and ima fan of non-phixion, ill bill and all them but to me necro jus doesnt cut it i really think he should consider other jobs."
2,Decent but not great,I had a few problems with this show. For one thing there was never a real feeling that the DA was ever going to lose a case. I got sick of seeing her win. It felt so set up that it took all the excitement out of the show. Didn't seem as real as other Law and Order shows. I would of enjoyed the show more if it wasn't clear that every defandant was guilty as hell.
2,Not worth the price!,"Regardless of the quality of the series, it is a rip-off to list price a 13-episode cancelled series at $60. Even the discounted Amazon price is too much relative to full seasons of other shows. This set should cost 1/2 as much as full seasons of the other L&O shows."
1,"Dead On Arrival - Not once, But Twice","I ordered a Konica Q-M200 digital camera. I received the first one and followed the setup instructions provided by Konica. The Camera would shutdown when I pressed the Shutter Release. Konica's help line told that it was a manufacturing defect. I called Amazon and they were super in sending me a replacement within 2 days. Alas, the replacement was also dead on arrival. When I try taking a picture the battery symbol on the LCD panel starts flashing. No pictures are taken. I finally threw in the towel and vowed never to touch a Konica camera again. Avoid this model like the plague."
4,Newer edition out.,There is a newer edition out (2011) but the Amazon search will not pull it up if you search just for the title. The new edition has chapters on fiberglass repairs and water borne paints
4,Excellent! I really enjoyed it!,"I read some of the reviews about this game and decided to buy the game. I thought the game was great. I have found a lot of adventure games are too challenging for me. I enjoy the level of the Nancy Drew series. Well, this one was not overly difficult where I had to find a cheat website on it. It was challenging enough for me to get stuck, then come back to it and figure it out. I also like the way the game can have different outcomes because of your conscience. I recommend it for those who like the the Nancy Drew series also."
2,Save your money,"I bought Tonka Construction, because of the good reviews. If I can save one person from buying this then I am happy! First the game is very hard to control you have to position the trucks exactly right or they will not do the task. It was very hard for me. My daughter (7) did not like it, because it was to hard to move! I bought it for my 3 year old boy so you can imagine the disaster. The game has a very good idea, but just poor quality. The choices are so few you play the same 3 games over build a road, clear an avalanch and build one of 3 buildings in the city. Wish I had not bought this game, get tonka town that is a Great!"
3,an okay novel,"This book was a little too cliched. It's set in the 1700s, where a lot of novels are set, and the story was a repeat of many romances I have read. Also, the love scenes are at least a chapter long, which I think just wastes space. We really don't want to know that much about Sassy and Roarke's intimate moments. I wouldn't really recommend this book, but everyone's entitled to their opinion."
5,LOVED IT!,"I loved this book so much! It was different and funny, sexy, had a twist you totally didn't see coming and was just awesome. Susan Mallery has created a wonderful book that makes it so easy to jump into!"
5,Entertaining and Romantic,"I love how Gracie and Riley share a past. And just the way they end up interacting, all because of Gracie's sister. I find it sad that if it hadn't been for Alexis, I dont think they would have spoken to each other again. And the fact that both Gracie and Riley have to go through hardships that are related and still come out ahead just shows the power of true love which Susan Mallery always achieve with her books."
4,Sweet and funny!,"This was a very sweet, fun read. The storyline featuring a young teenage girl that is obsessed with an older guy could have been creepy, but it was beautifully written. Gracie coming home after many years , sucessful in her own right having to deal with her childhood exploits had many laugh out loud moments! I loved Riley as a flawed hero. He had his faults, but I still fell for him.Both characters had things they had to come to grips with that made them the prople that they had become. They charactesr were funny and the storyline that at times spun towards crazy made this a memorable read. I couldn't put it down because I had to know what would go wrong next! Very funny and sexy!"
5,"Warm, Wonderful and Witty....You'll Fall for Gracie Too!","Falling for Gracie was a warm and spirited book. It was refreshing to read a romance filled with humor, warmth and strong characters. There were many lessons to be learned in this book a few being honesty, integrity and the art of communication. A very sensual romance, one I will read, over and over.Gracie's character was strong, spirited, fun, intelligent, and warm even though her family had sent her adrift. Riley, how does one describe an alpha male at his finest? Tall, dark, handsome, aloof and by his past...mistrusting, tormented and angry.How Gracie and Riley come together begins with their knowing each other in their past but now they meet again and sparks fly, while the entire town looks on and becomes involved in their romance.I highly recommend this book. It is one of Susan Mallery's finest."
1,Lame!!!!,"This is the lamest cd ever!!!!!!!!, doug munro is wack with his less than adequate lines over simple changes..., not recommended to anyone"
2,"Picture is missleading, NOT a set!","This is ONE 3/8"" drive 1/2"" hex socket!It is not a set!$7.50 for the set was a deal, but for ONE socket, not so much...:(There is nothing wrong with the socket, it's just not a set. Also not worth the expense and time to return it.I guess it's a gotcha! This is the 2nd time I've been caught offgaurd by missleading info in tools on this sight.So beware!"
1,A poor introduction to growing carnivorous plants,"While this book does have some nice photos, it is overall a poor introduction to the cultivation of carnivorous plants giving erroneous information concerning their cultivation, propogation, collection and distribution. This, in my opinion, makes it an unworthy book. Purchase 'The Savage Garden' or, if you can find it, 'Insect Eating Plants and How to Grow Them'. Both are much more worthy of the enthusiasts money!"
3,"Good Software, But Not For The Total Beginner","I bought my Instant Immersion German sofware at Sam's Club. My software came with 7 CDs. It was [$$$]. If you are going to buy this sofware, I suggest that you find one in the same brand that has more CDs for less money. It is hard for me (a beginner) because there is no exact part of the software that shows you an English word and then shows you the word translated in German. They begin talking to you in German and you have to sort of figure it out for yourself. One thing that I did like was that my 7 CD version included 3 CDs for Beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced (the same program, just 3 different levels). I highly suggest to purchase this program in addition to German audio tapes and books to get a head start. But once you get a little familiar with the language, it is a perfect software to buy. The best one on the market!"
2,Only good for the basics,"This book has nice pictures and some helpful information. However take it from someone who has purchased to many ""how to build a deck"" books. If you are actually going to build your deck, and if it is anything other than a basic 1 level deck out the back, if you want to do some really nice finish work, there is only one book I have found that even comes close to telling you how to do it and the tips and tricks. If you are serious save your money and buy Building a Deck: Expert Advice from Start to Finish. It is the only good book on building. You will be glad you did."
5,Great Book for Novice Builders,"This book is fabulous for anyone who wants to build a deck but doesn't know where to start. My husband and I used this book to build a deck even though we had never built anything this complex before. After looking over the detailed pictures (not drawings) and easy descriptions, we constructed a 16'x22' deck with angles. This book was a great help and I would recommend it to anyone looking to save money by doing it yourself."
4,Classic violins,"The violin on this album was amazing. COupled with the female vocals, it was chilling. My only complaint would be that there needed to be more vocals. Upon fist listening to this album, my friend thought it was instrumental. I find this amusing considering that Sins of Thy Beloved have 2 vocalists. I suggest that they make better use of these vocalists because Pete Johansen might as well make a solo album if they don't."
4,Hard to use while wearing glasses.,"Excellent binoculars! Found them difficult to use while wearing glasses. Constantly had trouble seeing to separate fields, unless I took my glasses off. Brightness and clarity is great."
3,A decent product by Nikon but some false advertising,"These are reasonably robust and feel like they might last a while. Optics clarity is good, perhaps on par with the Steiner Binoculars I also own. They are large however so do not plan on trekking with them around your neck too far. Pay no attention to the labels that say Japan on the front of the binoculars; these are actually MADE in CHINA, and overall a step down for Nikon."
4,Happy with purchase,"I purchased these binoculars for my husband for Christmas. They work very well, and provide a crystal clear image. Amazon got them to me very quickly which was great. The only reason they are not 5 stars is because they cost a bit more than I was hoping to pay, but as long as they last I am sure it will be worth it."
5,Nikon Binoculars,"Love them they were a gift for my birthday. My husband purchased them for me, so not sure when they were ordered but came in perfect condition."
2,Not the best of 'Fess,"This is the great Professor Longhair live on 10th March 1978, at the famous Tipitina's club in New Orleans. When I first bought this and played it, I was for a few minutes very confused by the strange sound. Then I realised that there was a Steel Drummer playing, which clashes badly with the Piano IMO. Supposedly it adds a caribbean flavour to proceedings, but in all honestly I'd have rather have had the conga player who used to play with Fess a lot of the time.On the plus side all the best 'Fess numbers are included and the last 3 numbers are solo Piano (introduced by James Booker). But I have to add the sound quality on these 3 numbers is poor - the Piano is very distorted.Certainly its a historic recording as having been to Tipatinas myself the club had a unique atmosphere but because of the unusual instrumentation and poor quality sound I would have to say this is for collectors only. Theres much better 'Fess out there to get than this."
3,Folks with scalp problems beware!,"The Biolage firm hold gelee product is nice and works well (too well), but for those who have problems with dry-scalp or build-up you should be careful. Within three weeks of use (maybe twice a week) and a normal hair-washing cycle, I was flaking on my ears and halfway down my forehead before stopping usage altogether. It took a month to treat this problem, but even with occassional use now it can still be annoying.As I said before, the product holds well and is easily reactivated regardless of time. I'd recommend purchasing a good deep cleanser if you want to use this product however."
1,Misleading...,"I ordered this software under the assumption it would be compatible with my operating system. It does, after all, say that it works with all Mac OS' from OS 7.5.3 or later.Well I have OS 10.3.8 and I can't get the software to work. It's looking for OS 9, and my computer didn't come dual boot.I'm pretty disappointed by that, as I was looking foward to testing this software out."
3,So you want to learn French,"The reason why I purchased this software is because I needed it to be compatible with Windows XP. It was compatible, however this program is quite child like. It is great for adolescents...to keep them stimulated and busy. The second CD World talk takes a leap into French converstion for an intermedate level. It is good .......but keep your eyes open for better French software."
3,A mix of everything,"This book was a surprise to me.it is a mix of many religious denominations concepts and also a little be of science and science fiction.Easy to read. One tend to empathize with the author in many ways. The author tries to back up her claims with different books that she had read before. It is obvious she is always has been drawn to this type of ideas.i must recognize that even when most of the thing she writes about area really hard to believe, many of her ideas and visions resonated within me with the power of the sun."
5,iPod shuffle,"This is the 2nd shuffle I've bought (1 for me and 1 for my husband). They are simple to use, with extremely simple directions. I am not a tech-savy person and yet I was able to learn how to download music from CD's and from itunes. I use it when I run and am on the treadmill-it's superlight and I just clip it to my waistband or stick it in my pocket. I love it!"
4,Good for hair care,"I got this as an add-on for a few dollars. I had intentions to make my own facial moisturizer, but I found I can't use it on my skin - I used a TINY bit in one spot to test out and I had a nice red pimple there the next day. I, however, use this in my hair. Just a small drop will do. After my hair is blow-dried, I use this to tame the fly-aways and smooth the ends of my hair. It's a small bottle, but it will last you awhile."
1,It's just unplayable,"It's a great idea gone horribly wrong: up the complexity of Civilization and Civ II, put in more units, more types of government, and watch the Civ addicts go into paroxysms of ecstasy.Hollow laugh. Instead, I got a game that took a full minute to one move just one piece, even with the 48M of RAM that the makers recommend. It would take me hours to finish one full turn in the later stages of the game, and I just don't have years to waste with this mess. With every agonizing minute, I was able to think about what I was missing away from the computer. Fresh air. Swimming. Human contact in coffee houses. Let's face it, when a computer game can't keep your interest sustained, when it actively drives you to shut the contraption off and get a life, it's just not a very good computer game. Stick with the livelier, faster Civ II."
1,Weak,"While the format of the book is good, the content appears weak. I bought it to learn about areas I didn't know, but to gauge the value of the information, looked at the one I do know (Lake Erie). Ohio, with over 260 miles of shoreline and some wonderful island trips, is omitted. In the directory of paddling clubs, the venerable Keelhaulers and Bradstreet groups are conspicuous by their absence. These are not insignificant oversights."
1,Waste of time and money,"At 243 pages $86 is the definition of exorbitant. The book itself is uninformed and overgeneralized. While the authors obviously understand many aspects of the Spanish language and its acquisition, they jump to many conclusions and make wild generalizations based on limited observation. The accompanying CD is difficult to navigate and unhelpful. I urge you to keep looking, there are certainly books written on this topic that are not motivated by the ""publish or perish"" mentality of university professors."
2,"Good Idea, bad execution","The idea behind this product is wonderful, but the product itself is lackluster. The software is terrible, the remote response is slow, and the user friendliness is not there."
3,Good Program; terrible G7 Tech Support,The program works as advertised. Don't have a problem though. No phone in tech support and no response to their web site e-mail system.G7 provides no support.
1,Worst Spanish software,"You cannot learn to speak sentences in spanish from this software, it only teaches some words, but does not teach you how to speak in sentences or how to conjugate verbs, and the dictionary is useless because it only speaks the english translation which we already know, and not the spanish!!! I don't recommend that anyone buy this. It was a waste of my money."
3,How to Prepare for the SAT 9 - 4th grade,"This is a good source for test preparation, second only to McGraw-Hill Spectrum Test Prep book."
2,Toshiba Digital Still M 65,"Although the camara is easy to use, the software is difficult. Additionally, battery time is < 2 hours of consistent use (alkaline). The USB software for downloading is difficult to use.You can only save to A drive, or a CD. I would like to save it to my ZIP disc (D-drive) so I can use less discs and port it to my other computers which have Zips. The accessories are expensive... I also don't like the fact that you have to print out the manual (105 pages) or read it on CD. For practice use and to learn how to use the camara, you must print it out. My PC won't recognize the USB port for this camara (and there is nothing wrong with the USB port) so I can only use it with my desk top. The ""on-line"" help is helpless. The Toshiba company places you in a ""loop"" for Q and A (ie: ""here are the most asked questions and answers"")!"
3,Plenty of Monster Madness,"I decided to check this out based on knowing some of the bands featured (Calabrese, The Spectremen, Others & Creepersin) and really dug it for the most part.There's a couple of tracks on here that I didn't like and usually it's because they have very in-your-ear vocal screaming which I personally don't like.Overall I'd say it's a pretty good horror punk/rock set. If you're familiar with any of the bands on here chances are you'll find more to like and discover some new bands."
3,Weekly Newspaper is Just as Good,and more up-to-date. Yellow pages. I don't know. What did I expect for 10 bucks
2,"I dont know what i was expecting, but this wasnt it!","I have always loved the music from HMS pinafore..I should have stuck to listening to the music, and not the video of the musical.I really was bored. I didnt care for some of the singing, and had heard far better (in my limited opinion here)singers of some of the same songs. I didn't watch much of it, sad to say... Well, not a complete loss,-- I gave it to my mother and she was thrilled! I dont think it was a bad production per se, just not to my liking! I guess i'll stick with Les Mis! :)"
2,An inferior version of Gilbert & Sullivan,"I have heard some excellect productions by Australian Opera, but this is not one of them.First, the words (which are in English, although with some of the singers one wouldn't guess that), must be understood to fully enjoy G&S; many of the singers in this production couldn't be understood. Second, Buttercup (in Pinafore) sang horribly, in fact I don't believe the noises she made can be called singing. Third, most of the singers used mics, which were not well mixed by the engineer and were a visual distraction.I would not recommend this DVD."
3,"A for effort, B- overall","No one quite sends up the British, especially in Gilbert and Sullivan, like the British. Opera Australia makes a gallant effort in this production, but falls short when compared to the recordings of D'Oyly Carte, Sir Malcolm Sargent,, and Sir Charles McKerras. Aside from unconvincing accents, the major flaw is the character of Sir Joseph Porter, upon whom the plot turns, here played as a buffoon. Absurd characters must take themselves very seriously indeed. Performers who play their roles for laughs miss the point, and that's what happens in this Sir Joseph, who should never lose his sense of self-importance and snooty dignity. Restrained hauteur would have served much more effectively."
4,a good read,"While this book was not as good as Kushiel's Dart, it was better than Kushiel's Choosen, and still a very enjoyable read. The characters which I came to know in the first two parts of this trilogy were still as full of life as before, and the plot was well thought out.Many questions left after Kushiel's Choosen were answered, such as Imriel, and the true nature of Phedre.All in all a book I would re-read, and one which I wish to see more of. I was sad to see Phedre's tale end."
5,Great Book,Love this series of fantasy novels. The story and characters are gripping. Definitely for the grown-up fantasy fan looking for more than just a coming of age story.
4,World traveling and loose ends tied up.,"Carey set this up so she could end the series here. There are still stories she can yet tell, but she's done a good job of tying up loose ends. I'm very satisfied with how she has ended it.This novel takes place ten years after the end of Kushiel's Chosen. Not much has happened in that time. For the first 200-300 pages of this novel, I wasn't that happy with it. Phedre does a LOT of traveling back and forth across the land, and Carey never delves deeply at all into any events or characters. This is partly because Phedre never spends more than a chapter or two in one place! Carey can't write well in that style. However, Phedre does end up spending time in several locations and it is that majority of the book that the story is extremely interesting and Carey shines.I definitely recommend the book and the entire series!"
3,O.K try to write them a lot more sccarier R.L. Stine,A good story but not scarey at all. It's about a boy called jack who is always being beaten by wilson his worst enemy. What's worse is that they both have a crush on a girl called Mia and Wilson is always impressing her. Then Jack finds this book about Human flight and tries it so he can beat Wilson ona impress Mia totally!
2,Not Worth It,"If you're looking for a program that will help you find a new hair style for yourself, I wouldn't recommend this one. There aren't many styles to choose from and some of them are unrealistic. I have dark brown hair and none of the hair styles matched my hair color. Also, those hair styles that I liked were only in Blond and Red and there's no option to change the color to my own. The lipstick section is very difficult to use and never seems to look right. There aren't many sunglasses to choose from. But some of them look okay. The ones with different colors (pink, blue) never look right. The hat section was okay, but I doubt most poeple would wear them. Most of the jewlery looks very odd, but some of it was okay. I would only recommend this program to those who just want to have a little fun with making people look kinda funny. If you're looking for something more realistic and with lots of styles to choose from, this program isn't for you."
2,Sexual content,"I love the BBC movies and the time periods in which they represent. My only qualm with this series is the random sexual content, which I can do without. For a better and more accurate review of the movies please refer to other reviews and the product overview."
2,I should have purchased something else,"I love the BBC series, but his wasn't near as good as others I've seen such as Hard Times or Berkeley Square, The Pallisers etc. Slow, just ok"
1,No 10.4 compatibility,Fortunately I only spent $ 6 on this used. I have a MacBook 10.4.11 and cannot install it.
1,Very Basic and not intuitive,My wife and I visit Italy often and thought it was time to at least attempt to learn the language. We ordered several books and programs to learn Italian and found the Instant Immersion program to be the worst of the lot. I would not recommend it for anyone that is seriously interested in learning Italian
1,Doubled over in pain,Let me be honest I am anything but an opera afficianado but I do like good music. I bought this on a whim. When I got home I slipped into my basket chair and slipped on my bose headphones and turned up the music. That is when the unfortunate event occured. I doubled over in pain because of the horrendous singing. This proves once again that Canadas major export of lame a%$ singing needs to be shipped back over the border.
5,what power,This gun is by far the most powerful framing nailer I have used. Drives 12 penny nails effortlessly through the toughest material. Lightweight makes it easy to operate all day long without fatigue. Great product.
1,Deceptive Title,"As other reviewers have mentioned, this book is useless without FinMetrics. It is merely a user manual for that package, and has hardly any intrinsic value on its own."
4,cool sound,"Neve's musical style reminds me of Pop/Rock bands Gin Blossoms, Better Than Ezra and Thisway. The album is full of catchy and rythmic guitar melodies. The songs ""it's over now"" and ""absent' are my favorites with it light guitar rythm and catchy lyrics. Neve has produce a hit album with it's first album release."
4,If you like the X-Files...,"If you like the X-Files you will enjoy this book. More a mystery with sinister biochemistry overtones than sci-fi, it gives you the creeps and ultimately leaves things unresolved. Our fearless FBI guy keeps trying to make the pieces fit. It takes 6 months and a lot of coincidences, but finally it all comes together. I found this an exciting read with lots of page turning suspense. The lingering meanace at the end made the premise more credible. And my hat goes off to anyone who can set a story in Newark, NJ.I am a Nancy Kress fan and have read several of her books including the Beggars series. This is quite different, no really awesome science or brave new future world. A good read for someone just starting out in science fiction and not wanting too much sci-tech."
3,IT ANT BAD!,THIS WAS ON THE SUMMER READ CHOICES LIST SO WE GAVE IT A READ!ITS AN EASY CUTE ENOUGH BOOK! NOT A MUST HAVE BUT JUST SOMETHINGFAST TO READ TOGETHER! (it had a funny part which the boys enjoyed)
5,The Best of both Worlds!,"When Autumn Falls is a fantastic CD! The best of both worlds. Good country swings and waltzes and even a touch of Jazz thrown in there. But when these boys decide to rock , they Rock! Great ballads and southern rock at its best! If you like Country and good ole Rock and Roll , then you need to buy this CD. Not too often does a band come around that can display the talent and artistic value to pull off a full realm of music styles that fits. The CD has a wonderful flow to it. Starts you off tapping your foot and by the end your head banging with your son!"
5,Perfect shape & fast service.,I never would have image it would arrive so fast and on time for Valentines Day. For a second hand book it was in great shape and all of us enjoyed it at our Valentines Party. Thank you for your great service.
3,Thin but worth the money,Shipping took a little longer than I would have thought and it's very very thin. But..colors are bright! Grommets seem strong. Cool indeed. Overall...worth the $4.49.
4,Great Camera!,"This is my first digital camera. I've seen other digital cameras in the 3+ megapixel range and this beats all of them. The picture quality is amazing. It's very easy to use and all the features in the camera are for the beginners/novices, but I guess if you're into professional features you wouldn't be spending under a grand. As far as the other comments I read, the USB connection has no flaws on my computer. It's quick and easy to use on the two picture software I have. The only flaws are the battery use and the 8 meg card that it comes with. Upgrade to the 128 meg and take 2400 X 1600 pics up to 84 times. Also, upgrade to NiMh rechargable batteries."
1,"Camera good, company bad, do not buy","Toshiba does not honor their warrantys, and will refuse to sell you parts! The tripod mount is made of cheap plastic, and will strip out in no time. When I asked Toshiba for a new one, which I even offered to pay for, they refused! This is a dishonest, predatory company that has no honor. Buy their produts at your peril...buy a Cannon instead, very good cameras, honest company. I will never buy another product from them."
2,Worked for 18 Months,"I purchased this unit for our small office and was very happy with it until it died unexpectedly this morning after what I consider a too-short life of 18 months. Only a few months after we bought it one of the ports went bad, but with 23 others to choose from I didn't care that much. But now none of them function. Considering the name-brand and the price ($180 at the time) I expected it to last at least 3-5 years before giving up the ghost. Now I'm looking for a replacement and was surprised to see it rated so highly. I don't write many reviews but this is not a 4 or 5 star product."
2,Requires semi-frequent reboots in small office environment,"Our office used this switch since it was a cheap, gigabit switch that did not require a fan (read: quiet). We pass around a decent amount of data and this switch turned out to be very unreliable. Sometimes, it would hang and no traffic would get through. A simple reboot solved the problem but that makes it too unreliable for use in any professional context. We've actually had similar experiences with D-link networking gear in the past.We went ahead with theCisco SR2024T 24 port 10/100/100 Gigabit Switch. It's a bit less than 2x the cost of this but has been very stable and is quiet/fanless as well."
3,Mine died! After almost 3 years...,"Bought my ""Gigabit"" Switch back in September 2008. It is a breeze to setup and just works. So, I give it 5-starts for Ease of Use and 5-stars for wokirng as expected. But it just died after 2 years 11 months. So, must give it only 2-stars for reliability.Then again, it worked flawlesly for 3 years and for the price, I must say that I feel confortable recommending it.For the replacement, I think I'll go with the TRENDnet TEG-S24Dg, just to see. It is fan-less and slient and it does has a 5-stars review, but only from 1 user.I'll let you know.Here's the website link for more info:[...]Amazon:[...]"
4,Noche de Cuatro Lunas,"I know Julio is not everyone's cup of tea, but if you like his kind of music, which I do, you'll love this album. I do not like everything he has done, but Julio and the production team have really done themselves proud here. You won't be sorry you got it. Beautiful."
3,"Not the ""ultimate.""","Although this book is amazingly informative, it's not the ultimate nor the best.Cheaper books by some of the most unknown authors are better.I bought the book, but then gave it to one of my aspiring grandchildren who is just learning to airbrush.It's a nice try, but came up a little short compared to other books on the shelf."
2,Should of purchased Chiltons.,This book does not have the detail that my Chiltons have had for other vehicles I have owned. Had to go on-line to find out how to get my radio out of my Toyota Avalon.
3,Good for General Information,"This manual is good for general information, but don't expect it to substitute a good service manual. Some of the topics covered in the manual are in better detail than others. If you want thorough steps and procedures in performing maintenance and repair, I suggest you spend a little more money on a better manual."
4,"Excellent read, but how credible is the information?","Schickel does a good research and puts facts down as they are, but he analyzes those facts from his own point of view. He thinks Disney works have manipulated masses who were of an inferior intellect and the company made fortune out of it.While this may be true, the book could have been more balanced, with an unbiased view, mentioning many favorable things the Company created."
4,good Camera,"I have this camera now for 4 weeks and it works great. Installation was pretty easy if you know a little bit about your own wireless network.The camera takes good pictures and did not use to much space on your hard drive. The motion detection is hard to adjust but works, you may get some files with nothing on it. Price for this product is a little bit to high but I would recomend it to a friend."
1,Camera locks up,"I just received this camera 3 days ago, and when it is working it is great, but you do have to reboot it about every 2 - 3 hours. I wish I had read these reveiws before purchasing this expensive camera.I will probably send the one I have back to where I purchased it, but it sounds like this is a problem with the camera's program and not that I happened to get a lemon. My first D-Link camera was the DCS 2100+ and I never had to reboot it. I thought I was upgrading to a better camera and not more problems."
1,Doesn't fit the ATW Cargo Wagon at all.,"It's a great idea, and I wish it fit, but it doesn't. The pad doesn't fill the wagon bed and the velcro tabs are in the wrong place on the side pads."
1,Not For Wagons With Only Two Slats!!!!,"I recently purchased this pad set for my #22 Radio Flyer Wagon, but had to send them back. If you check the Radio Flyer web site, you'll notice that the #22 Wagon sides only have two wide slats. When I received this pad set, I noticed the picture on the package shows a wagon with three narrow slats. The loops to attach this set of pads are intended to be affixed to the center slats. Since my wagon only has two slats, and they are wider, the loops were in the wrong spot and weren't big enough to fit around the slats on my wagon. I'm only guessing, but I think these might be for an older model of wagon."
5,This is the EASIEST and most reasonable holistic pet guide.,"Before this book, I had decided it would be WAY too much work to switch to a natural diet. This decision was based on other holistic resources that went hard-core overboard, suggesting elaborate (and often kooky) lifestyle and perspective changes.This book is soft-core, describing many reasonable ""baby steps"" you can take that will make your pet's life better with only minor effort on your part (like a cottage cheese supplement for dry chow). If you are like me and the reader above, you will eventually feed your pet exclusively the natural diet and you will gain a holistic perspective about his/her health. You may then crave more hard-core information."
4,An excellent resource,"for those whose pets have special dietary requirements.Having fed a super-premium, human grade kibble I was very happy with the status quo. My dogs were extremely healthy and happy - until a food allergy damaged my older dog's pancreas causing chronic pancreatitis.No longer could he digest even the best of dog food. The only alternative was prescription food filled with by-products and chemicals or a homemade diet.Together with my vet, we are beginning to put together a healthy homemade diet to ensure that my dog will live a long and happy life. I bought this book in hopes that there would be recipes to provide variety.Instead of a list of recipes, however, I got an an education in nutrition and how ""alternative"" remedies can go hand-in-hand with traditional veterinary care.The book also provided an eye-opening glimpse into food production. Not only am I changing my dogs' diets, I'm change my own as well."
5,Back to the heavy,"This Kalamazoo-based band brings the heavy. Don't let the opening instrumental fool you...it's only their dark side coming out in a classical form. Grotto plows through their set list like a freight train, pausing to let breathe only occasionally. And the studio sound is just a fraction of the fun that ensues when these guys play live. For an ""independent"" album, Silence Broken blows away much of the music out there today. Sunspot Recording should be much bigger based on the quality. I'm definitely looking forward to more from these guys. Get in on this before they blow up and the original album is no longer in print. Put in the disc and turn up the stereo kids...it doesn't get much better than this."
3,teenagers in love,"This book talks about a young girl who thinks about soldier guys. She thinks it is bad if you have a boyfriend like this because she says you can't trust in him,you never know what will happen when he is on one of those trips.Maybe he will get another girl.But what happens is she is in real love with this guy and she loves him and everything is about letters because they just were together one time and then they are in love just from letters. They are waiting for a date again I think this happens sometimes when you are in love, and you don't care about what anybody said and you just think about your boyfriend and you are going to take care of your relationship. If you do,you are going to be happy."
2,Love Letters.,This story is about a sailor and a young girl who takes care of four brothers to help her mother.I like it because it shows how you are young and have a good feeling about everything.I recommend it to young people who believe in love at the first time.
5,Black & Decker Tops,"Black & Decker helps us again. We found this book, like their others, to be ever so informative with great and helpful illustrations. Since we did most of the work ourselves we loved this book."
3,"NOT a ""complete"" guide","This book does not discuss a single thing about well pumps or reservoir tanks. For those living in the country, or do not have city water, this will be a piece of important information that is lacking. Several years ago my well pump got clogged and I tried to repair it. Unfortunately, I had no information on how to do so safely because books like these don't discuss them. The pump takes 230V and I only shut off 115V (half of the electricity), and in the process got electrically shocked. I was ok, but caught off guard a bit. The electrical panel was not labelled correctly, but if I knew more about well pumps then I probably would have figured out the voltage thing beforehand.This book is somewhat expecting that you live in the city or suburbs. It would be nice for an update that includes maintenance/installation of a well pump and water reservoir."
5,an excellent book.,It is an excellent book not only for handyman beginners but also for construction professionals to review plumbing details.
4,Good for 1st time DIY,"Good overview of general residential plumbing. Wish the book would cover more on plumbing code, UPC that is used in most of California."
1,Not recommended,I bought this book and it was very disappointing. It has nice pictures but leaves out key basic information like the measurements for doing rough-in work for bathroom fixtures. I ended up going to the library to get useful information. This book is perhaps useful for someone who knows absolutely nothing about plumbing but is not good for any one with more knowledge. I consider it a waste of my money
2,OK,Pretty general. Not much detail instruction. Pretty pics that are not very infomative. Wish I had bought another! OH well.
1,Flimsy,"The lapel clip broke the first day I got this. Call quality is ok but without the lapel clip, I have to hold the microphone close to my mouth with my hand. Not exactly safe when driving! It defeats the purpose for which I purchased this - safety!"
4,Stock Replacement for Sony Ericcson Headphones / Handsfree,"For a stock set of headphones these actually have acceptable bass and pretty good clarity even at high volume. Surely not a Shure pair of head phones but not bad. Also not a bad option if you don't want to go with Bluetooth having to deal with charging etc. and those not always the best for music except for a rare few stereo bluetooth devices which your phone may not support or an awkward additional Bluetooth music headphones. These were way cheaper than a replacement at the phone store, that's for sure. I'll probably lose them again and be back."
3,good sound but plug fails too soon,In general I have problems with the Sony male plugs. They don't stay well connected after a few months. I do use my devices 6-7 hours a day so that may be my problem.
2,Cheap cost means cheap product,"The handsfree device broke after using it twice and does not fit into the inputs on the phone great, you have to force it. The cords for the headphones a weird, one is 3 times longer then the other. The quality of the headphones is low and the volume is also low. I suggest using this handsfree as a headphone adapter for your own headphones. However, this product is cheap and if you can get it to work right without breaking is well worth your money"
4,"First pair did not work, but prompt replacement did!","The product itself is cheaply made and that is reflected in the price. For my W800i it been doing the job for the past few weeks now, and so thumbs up for an otherwise cheaply made product."
1,Broke after one use,"Only ordered these because Sony is to cheap to provide you a set when you buy their phone, plus standard 2.5mm ones won't work on Sony phones (shame shame). I used them once and then sound no longer came out of the left side."
1,IT IS TERRIBLE,"The product was in a terrible state, I bought a new item and the gave me a used one, very dirty and in a bad state. I don't recomedn this seller."
5,Sony Ericsson Stereo Portable Handsfree HPM-70,It is a high quality product from the Original Equipment Manufacturer. After using it for a month I can verify it works trouble free. The stereo sound is very good from my Walkman music player included in the phone. Great price and well worth the $5.95 for shipping and handling.Sony Ericsson Stereo Portable Handsfree HPM-70
2,Average sound quality,"The earphones work well when playing music. But while answering phone calls over handsfree, there is some echo effect and disturbance."
3,"Good Sound, but...","Great sound quality for the price I payed (under $10 - includes tax and shipping). I gave it 3 stars, because after a week or so, I can no longer hear the sound on the right ear piece. I thought about returning it, but I didn't beacause it's a hassle and I can still use the headset with just the left ear piece."
3,Not what I was expecting,"I purchased this book for my upcoming Health Occupations Aptitude Exam (HOAE) and unfortunately this book just does not go enough into depth about any given subject. At the end of each chapter there is a list of other sources for study. If I wanted other sources, I would have purchased them instead of this study guide. I was hoping for a bit more of a comprehensive review. Nonetheless, I think you will find that much of the core of what you need to know is discussed in this book in basic detail. There are 3 practice exams to help you gauge your progress."
2,Practice test answers are wrong,I bought this book for my Health Occupations Test (HOT). I've taken Practice Test I in this book and now covering the different sections. The explanations are very good. But I was so disappointed that some of the answers given for the practice test are wrong!
5,uk classic,As a big fan of uk hiphop i was very happy when i find this classic album in the bargain bin at my local record store in 1992 a couple of years after it came out and i am still playing now. one of the five best hip hop albums of all time.
4,Fellowes Adjustable Keyboard Manager (8031301),"Tray is super heavy duty and was easy to assemble and install. Comes with wrist support pads for mouse and keyboard, mouse pad, and non slip pad for keyboard. They keyboard tray is several inches wider than the keyboards I have."
2,poor support for those ergonomically-challenged,"I bought this keyboard tray because it was supposed to be fully adjustable, since I suffer from carpal tunnel syndrome. The adjustment knob is very tight and difficult to manuveur. The tray is not fully adjustable; ""partially adjustable"" would be a more appropriate description. The largest dissapointment is that the mouse tray is too heavy for the keyboard tray and thus tilts the entire tray to the right (as I am right handed). The mouse tray is also much lower that the tray itself, which is a big problem. Now I have a keyboard tray that is not helping me at all. If you are suffering from carpal tunnel, then I do not recommend this keyboard tray at all."
1,Fellows Keyboard holder with mouse tray,"The product was bought to replace our current keyboard trays which do not have the mouse support. After installation, I found the product was not as adjustable as our previous ones. The tray that holds the keyboard I think is too heavy for this application and the mouse tray is way to low. The adjustment knob requires to much effort to make an adjustment and with the keyboard tray being heavy, makes it even more cumbersome."
1,no freedom,"I bought this mouse with the hopes of being free from the cord tether. While it does give some degree of freedom, I found that the mouse must remain within about 18"" of the receiver in order for it to work. Heck, my cord was longer than that! A waste of good money."
2,Well....,The hubby bought this not checking to see if was XP compatible. I couldn't find the correct drivers online so my brother who is 'savy on the pc' is searching for me. Not the manufacturer's fault but I do believe Microsoft should make it easier to find what you need on their site.
3,Good Info Buried Inside,"""Creating an Herbal Bodycare Business"" is less of an actual ""how to"" and more of a New Age outlook book. That being said there is a good amount of practical advice to be found in the pages, but it will take some digging to get at the important stuff. We already own a reasonably successful ""brick and mortar"" store and produce our own line of Bath & Body products, but wanted to get this book to add to our library.If you are not overly concerned with New Age philosophy, I would recommended starting with something likeStart Your Own Business, Fifth Edition: The Only Start-Up Book You'll Ever Needor evenSmall Business For Dummies, and look for another book on making bodycare products (such asClean, Naturally).CFH"
2,I absolutely hated this book,I could absolutely not force myself to finish the first chapter. It started out slow and was very poorly written. Not every book is meant for everyone and this one was definitely NOT for me.
1,Reboots every 30 seconds,"The unit worked for a day or two, but now reboots itself every 30 seconds, dropping the connection. This continues even after power cycling it and reverting to the default settings. Absolutely useless!"
4,Friggen huge mohawk and a wonderful Two nights,"2 Greyhound tickets from Seattle to Hollywood = $200+4 tickets to the show = $100Seeing the BEST show I have ever been too again and again = PricelessBeing on the DVD = PricelessI'm in this DVD. That's right kids...I'm the guy that flips off the camera with the mohawk. Sure, it's a good half of a second of footage...but it ROCKS for sure.This DVD is awesome. It's SO great to be able to relive the best 2 nights of nonstop rockin' in the comfort of my home. The DVD audio is wonderful, but I wish the DVD would have gotten more of the croud. The Pallidium was PACKED with tons of energy and mosh pits filled with BR fans from one side to the other. The top balcony was filled...but you couldn't tell from this DVD. Other then that, the DVD is awesome. Tons of great BR favorites, tons of extra features, and a SWEET set of live performances from the early 80s where Greg sounds more like Darby Crash then Greg Graffin.If you have the funds, buy this DVD. Mike out."
2,unsat.,"I WAS sorry that I bought it, being there was so many others I might have bought. I grew up honoring the name of CECIL B. DEMILLE and I guess I was too hasty in buying this. THE Cleopatra movie is rated the highest by leonard maltin, and it definetly doesn't deserve the 3.5 rating. THE other movies are kind of dated but thats ok,one can't expect too much. THE collection is not worth $25.00. AT $15 or $16 , it would be ok., BUT, perhaps the price is due to the exciting UNION PACIFIC which was just as good this time as it was when I saw it a half century ago."
3,The Crusades,"The Crusades:Watching ""The Crusades"" I alternate between cringing at the glaring ignorance and disregard of history and the ridiculous activities proceeding on screen and being amazed at the grandeur of the spectacle and some of the masterfully composed shots.The rest I have either not seen or not seen recently."
4,Vintage DeMille,"I was more interested in the three older films: Cleopatra, Four Frightened People, and Sign of the Cross, since they were produced before the censor's code stymied DeMille. These early talkies offered quite an eyeful and earful! The other two were good period pieces; less theatrical and pretentious than some of DeMille's later films. Technical quality great considering the age of the movies."
1,'Arizona Ripper'? I don't think so!,"I have seen ""Terror At London Bridge""/""Bridge Across Time""/""The Arizona Ripper"", and it is mind-blowing badly done. The plot: the old London Bridge is moved from the English capital city to Arizona where it is rebuilt. AMAZINGLY, the spirit of Jack the Ripper (London prostitute serial killer, Aug.-Nov.1888) is locked in the stones of the newly erected bridge, and is hungry for more victims. A mish-mash of gore and bore. Not for anyone with an ounce of common sense."
2,Which models does it fit,does this work with all models of the wagon . . . eg the All Terrain Steel and Wooden Wagon?
1,a useless book,"Don't waste your time. This book consists of the kind of things you would get from reading a newspaper column such as asking ""is the contracter licensed?"" and ""can the contracter be reached in an emergency?"" A better resource is guides such as those by Sunset or Time-Life"
2,Cables,"These are simply Patch Cables. The ends seem tightly secure, but only time will tell. Who knows, the ends might just stay on this time."
3,Summer Scent Review,I loved all of the four season made but this one didn't live up to the other three to me. It had moments that were good but on the whole the movie let me down in every area including the music. I would recommend it as a part of the four season series but by itself I wouldn't.
2,AWFUL,"I OWN MANY SERIES SUCH AS : WINTER SONATA, HOTELIER, STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN, AUTUMN IN MY HEART , DAE JANG GEUM, ALL 3 VOLUMNS AND LOVE STORY IN HARVARD AND MANY MORE , AND LOVED THEM ALL. BUT I QUIT WATCHING THIS ONE HALF WAY THROUGH THE SERIES. ALL IN ALL I WAS VERY DISAPOINTED."
3,Price,I have looked over many pages of this compressor. I have yet to find one cheaper then I can buy in town. I thought the internet would have them somewhere cheaper.I can buy this compressor 45 dollars cheaper AT A LOCAL PARTS HOUSE.Four Seasons 58992 Compressor with Clutch
3,"it's OK, but....","Probably would have given a 4 star review if the case had been the same color as pictured. The one we received was black with red accents, NOT the pretty blue we thought we were getting. Will probably look elsewhere but this one will work for now."
4,"Product fine, Amazon lacking","The product is fine however it arrived in packaging that looked like it had been kicked around in a warehouse for a few years. The packaging had been taped up for shipping but not before half of the small parts had been lost. The manufacturer replaced the missing parts at no cost. Once the parts were received, the backboard / hoop could be assembled quickly and is now working well and I expect that it will work well for many years."
3,Versace Shampoo,I have used the original versace shampoo that came with the gift pack including after shave balm. This product did not smell the same as the original product. The smell is different than the original and the Versace logo is not the same as on the original package. I think this is a fake.
1,Sorry fans this one just does not cut it for me,I have a brand new higher end home theater system. I watched the blu Ray disc last night. I am not a fan of Shakira in fact I have never heard or seen her work. I am also 58 so this may be a generational thing. However I love concert videos and have a large collection spanning several genres. I also love Latin singers. In addition I am an avid concert goer. My main disappointment was with the audio recording of this disc. Don't get me wrong. The music was crystal clear. It was just that it was hard to hear Shakira. Her voice seemed to blend in with the music in a way that it was difficult to hear what she was singing. I tried the various sound stages on my pioneer receiver however no luck. I stopped watching the disc because I was disappointed. I so much wanted to and was expecting to enjoy this one. If anyone has a suggestion of another disc of hers that I can watch where her voice is more distinct I would like to give it a try.
3,"Ótimo show, mas... faltam legendas. =/","Gostei do blu-ray, ótimo show, mas faltam legendas!Para quem gosta de ler o que está sendo cantado, faz uma baita falta."
4,Bought it for the price. Ended up liking it.,It was available for less than fifteen so I picked it up. I liked Shakira's first major Spanish album before her international success. I hadn't really listened to her newer stuff. When I put it in I was pleasantly surprised. The visuals are great and the sound is even better. To be honest I do skip a few songs whenever I watch it but I still consider it a good purchase for the price.
2,Has anyone actually listened to this DVD?,"I've been a Shakira fan for a little while and thought Live & Off The Record and Unplugged were great DVD's, that looked and sounded good. I was looking forward to this disk and have to admit that I'm terribly disappointed in the sound quality or total lack thereof. During La Tortura it became just that. The switching from Shakira sounding like she was overdubbing the song in a studio to Alejandro Sanz who actually sounded like he was at the concert was abysmal. There seemed to be a lot of overdubbing going on with this disk.Don't get me wrong. If you simply want to see what the last Shakira tour looked like this is a great disk. If you are also hoping for great sound quality you will be greatly disappointed."
1,Not your daddy's best of...,"Going in I knew that this was a re-recorded best of. However, knowing they still successfully put on a good live show I gave it a shot. I was immediately disappointed. Rather than start with the first track, I went straight to Rock Me and Lady Red Light. Classics from the Once Bitten album. My first response is what happened to the punchy in your face guitar work. The guitar sounded like it was filtered through a wah pedal and ended up real muddy. The singing is actually very good and the guitar work seems on, it's just that you can't really tell through the bad guitar sound and in the background mix. It's as if they preferred to highlight the drums and bass. Admittedly, if the guitars were better I wouldn't have been as disappointed but the guitar is what drove the songs originally, supplemented by the bass and drums (and some keyboard). If you have the originals, stick with them and pass on this rehash. (only exception - House of Broken Love)"
2,flimsy and floppy,".,..P>Beautiful saw, until you run your first piece of wood acrossthe table which becomes scratched and marred imediately.The body is what I would expect from the cheapest tools aroundnot the most expensive. The suspension is absolute garbage,You have plastic gears that raise and lower the saw and the factory recomends keeping them packed with grease wich we allknow will become a saw dust magnet. After cutting one piece of wood they were caked in sawdust which I would assume willeventually cause binding. The subframe is garbage too.I am very disapointed to see such poor quality and craftsmanshipfrom a noteworthy company.On the other hand the motor is strong and the fence is accuratebut so what, The motor and fence won't do me any good if the blade won't raise or the body has cracked. I should have gone with the Dewalt evan though it's motor does not compare it'snot loaded with fatal design flaws.If this saw holds up I'll be shocked... more later......."
1,Bosch 4000 motor burned-out after a couple of years,"Very disappointed in this saw. While it was working, it was great. Plenty of power and the angle adjustment and raise/lower features worked well, etc. However, I think a $500 tool needs to last at least 5 years, longer when used as infrequently as I now use mine. I am not a tradesmen, but rather do some home remodeling (just on my own home) and woodworking projects such as building a desk and a white oak table for my Big Green Egg. For the amount I use it, this saw should've lasted me a decade. I am done with Bosch after this experience."
3,wouldn't buy it again,I've had my saw for just over a year and in general I am pleased. I did throw themiter guage away and replace it with Incra. The fence is finnicky. Out of the box the blade needed needed minor adjustments but I felt I was getting good results. I have some difficulty cutting some things accurately and finally realized that the table top isn't flat. Not even close. It appears to be attached to the base at the four corners and bows up in the middle.I'm sure it's a great contractors saw but it's a long way from a cabinet saw.Blade changing is a pain and dust collection leaves something to be desired.
5,I love this saw,"I have used this saw on two jobs (framing to finish) and I am very satisfied. Keep in mind this is a job saw and not a shop saw. It is light weight,fairly accurate, and sufficiently powerful. The wheel adjustment for heighth is a joy for those of us who have struggled with the old twist type adjustment. The extendable fence is very clever. The outfeed and side support work well and store away nicely. The stand is sturdy and handy. Portability is good with a nice clip to put the fence away and a blade holder. Over-all a 100% improvement in portable saws."
5,Great little workhorse,"Should have bought the base w/ casters. This model is the envy of every contractor who has used it. ""That'll be my next table saw"" is what they say. The soft start is a nice feature as the lights don't dim when the motor is fired-up. Saw does not bog under heavy loads. Would prefer either a steel top or a higher quality aluminum rather than soft cast aluminum. Any metal shavings or nails left in boards easily gouge the surface."
2,OH THANK HEAVEN FOR 7-11,"No Slurpees at this convenience store! Plenty of ice cream, donuts and beer (Note that the beer is called ""Maze""--a salute to the director. Steve Guttenberg should go back to POLICE ACADEMY and forget this one. Lots of loopy plotholes and little if any genuine thrills or suspense...but lots of sneaky cockroaches.There's nothing new here so if you're tired of cookie cutter slashers avoid this. If looking for a fresh new horror, I highly recommend HUSK!"
3,Corny,"See ""Cornered"" only by having low expectations because while it is not wretched, I have seen hundreds worse than this. It commences as a curious premise: serial killer in convenience mart, then just dissolved into lukewarm movie material used to fill in extra space from start to finish. The acting is respectable in parts, disreputable in parts.Overall, a tepid movie that spoils abidingly towards the half."
1,This movie was horrible,"I knew within the first 10 minutes that Steve Guttenberg was the killer and that he was going to kill the other characters in the manner they were describing killing a local serial killer (who they don't know is actually Guttenberg). There, I just saved you from 70 minutes of bad writing and acting."
2,"Self-Consciously ""Quirky""","After enjoying the quirky, lurching rhythm of ""The Loop"" I thought I'd try another Coomer and ""Apologizing to Dogs"" was an intriguing title.Alas, it has nothing to do with dogs or apologizing (a bassett was featured prominently in ""The Loop"") and everything to do with a writer who is very self-conscious. The story takes a back seat to the writing here, in a very mannered, gimmicky and ultimately tedious exposition. It tries so hard to be ""quirky"" that the unfortunate loser is the story. It reads like a class project, or a community college creative writing assignment (and that isn't good).Coomer is capable of better. I plan to try some others next, and hope this misstep is an anomaly."
3,An enjoyable romp,"Do you want multifaceted characters? Do you want humor? Do you want tragic characters who somehow have an implacable hope?Apologizing to dogs is not Shakespeare, but it is the makings of a tragic/comedy. You have divorce, resentment, blackmail. lost dreams, and forlorn hopes all in a single contemporary Southern Setting in this book. Will you be elevated to a new level? No. Will you be brought to a mad-cap place with unbelievable characters that somehow, are resonant? Yes.Please read this book. If not only to be amused (it would make a wonderful film) but also to be taken away from the doldrums of ""real"" life. This is a fun novel."
4,response to Linda Bergin,"I just saw this book featured on the PBS show ""AIR."" It showcased many of the images from the book. Only the most heartless could fail to feel compassion and awe for the people depicted here and the brave photographers who did the work. I cannot accept the remark that the photos are somehow from Saddam's ""point of view."" They are a facet of the reality, a facet which we as Americans must confront, sooner or later, because it is our government that has set this chain of events in motion.Ms. Bergin, please, if your idea of fighting for freedom is to deny the truth of suffering, at least have the integrity to spell ""freedom"" correctly."
3,Cute but forgettable,"3.5 stars. This is my fist book by this author and I have to admit I was pleasantly surprised. Of course the most adorable part of the book are Libby and Janie. Sloan and Emily were cute but honestly...no one seemed real. If anything this book is a reincarnation of the Cartwrights--but with an seventy-five old grandmother instead of an older father. Everyone always just does the right thing and have absolutely no flaws. They were too one dimensional. Even with its HQ cookie-cutter ingredients: cute children plotting for a new daddy, a woman with limited sexual experience, and a man with no clue--I find I still enjoyed the story. Yet, two-hours later, I was struggling to remember names and events...so cute...but forgettable."
4,Nice basic 2 GB card,Got this basic card at a decent price - shipping was a bit steep but the low price on the card compensated for that. Does what was expected of it for a basic 2GB card. using it for an older device that can maxes out at 2 GB card storage.
5,Works great with my Slvr L7,I bought this memory card because I needed an upgrade for my slvr. The 512 MB memory card only holds 100 songs so I was pretty happy with the capacity of the 2 GB Micro SD card. It works great.
4,"Blackberry Pearl, works well!",This is perhaps the best accessory for the Blackberry Pearl. I needed to update the firmware on the phone to recognize the card. The card should work as expected if you are running version 4.2.0.64 or newer.With 'Missing Sync' software I can now reliably sync my Macintosh systems to the phone. It also mounts the flash memory as a storage device on the desktop.The memory is not fast when transferring data from the computer to the phone. Phone operations appear lively enough for interactive use. Blinding speed would earn a five star rating.
2,Not Much Trail-Running-Specific Stuff in Here ...,"Gotta say, I was quite disappointed with this book. I am a novice runner who is thinking about getting into trail running -- and I'm also an experienced hiker, climber, etc. I was expecting this book to talk to me about the details of trail running, but instead, it dwells over-long on just being in the backcountry -- just like any other hiking book, but not as well as the best of that genre. So ... I returned it."
3,hmmm,"this is a total joke book. i get the joke and it's sorta funny, but it's also sorta pointless and doesn't really offer any useful information. it's just kind of a throw away gift-book for slutty friends (of which i have a few). if that's what it's supposed to be, great but i was hoping for more. overall i'm just kind of disappointed."
2,Meh.,"I read the book out of curiosity. I wouldn't say it was either untrue or necessarily true for my generation or the one after it. I graduated 2 years ago. This culture certainly applies for a segment of girls. But they're the ones who don't know how to get into a relationship, sustain a relationship, or inspire any sort of commitment from a guy. Society and what's expected might change, and this is certainly not abnormal. But its not how you enter a relationship and the authors seemed to miss that. Men don't change - getting a boyfriend hasn't really changed all that much either. But these authors seem clueless about how to move from bootycall to boyfriend, which is a disservice to all of the girls who want that to happen. As for hooking up and bootycalls, its popular BECAUSE its so easy. Why you would need an instruction manual for it, I have no idea. Maybe an ok read if you have some spare time to kill. But I wouldn't seek this book out."
4,Filter the Hype and you got a great book,I like this book. I got a lot out of it. It's written in short chapters with tips you can deal with and the guy obviously can put it down on paper and make a difference. I learned a lot and will learn lots more I am sure as this book is a keeper for writers.What I agree with the one reviewer on here that I read is that there is an ample amount of hype in here that you have to filter out. If you do you got something. I guess we all have a degee of hype so take it out and gather up the jewels he offers cause they are in here.
4,Mind Seduction.,"This is the fist book I bought on this subject and I did find it to be quite helpful. Helpful for writing any kind of letter, helpful for web-sites, helpful for blogs and helpful for novels.The author touches on everything you need to know, when it comes to writing hypnotically. One thing he seems to do though, is state the same thing in different ways, in different chapters. I am guessing this book could be rearranged and edited down to half it's size.Overall though I would highly recommend it to anyone who has something to communicate in writing. The book also has some good references to other writers and what they have to offer. Buy it."
1,What a total rip off!!! $50 for 2 pairs of drum sticks!!!!,"Seriously. What a total rip off!!! $50 for 2 pairs of drum sticks!!!! And then $12 for shipping!! Even though they are sized for youngsters, they aren't even worth 1/4 of what they are being sold for. All I can think is that they are up here for grandmas who don't know any better to buy for birthdays and christmas at a ludicrous markup. Shame on this merchant.Want sticks for kids? Get these:Vic Firth Kidsticks"
3,Not the best design,"I've purchased these in the past for my husband in the Chicago area but the pakol hat is no longer available from my usual source and I needed to find an alternative one without having to make a lot of calls or do too much leg work. Finding it at Amazon.com from two sources I purchased one from each. Hate to say but I'm really disappointed in the quality of the design from this seller. The material is fine but the craftsmanship and design does not compare to previous purchases, nor the online competitor. I've since purchased additional hats from the second Amazon.com seller."
2,Energetic but not funny,"Wow. This guy is filled with energy. He was on the verge of being funny a number of times. I hate it when comedians apologize for jokes or content of jokes...just go for it. If it is offensive, so what?The part where he rubbed his stomach could have been hilarious if it had lasted only a few seconds instead of what seemed like forever.He could be funny if he polished his act."
2,Not for teaching,"We bought this for my son who took it to a guitar instructor. When tuning the instrument he found that the frets are improperly positioned for use. This means notes and chords cannot be played musically on the strings when frets are required. (Which is always)The mechanics of guitar playing can be taught but ""music"" cannot be produced."
1,garbage,if you want to introduce the guitar to your child dont waste your money this is nothing more than a toy. this will not stay tuned!
3,Won't stay tuned!,"This guitar has a nice sound to it, but won't stay tuned at all! My son received it for his fifth birthday, as he has been begging for a guitar. I tuned it with the book and CD put out by the same manufacturer, and did so with little problem, although I do not myself play guitar. I used the book to see how to finger the G chord (the first one), then played the first song. It needed to be retuned after each song. That is my only criticism, but it may be too frustrating for a child (and the parent!) to have to constantly tune it."
3,Practical but flimsy. Duct tape required.,"Even after reading many negative reviews, I still thought we *had* to have this umbrella for our wagon. It's the perfect size, it fit great but unfortunately it snapped in two the very first use. You have to be very very careful where you touch it to bend it. It's a great shade for your wagon if you don't mind going through several of them or using a bit of duct tape. I think my kids are going to be better off with a lot of sunscreen and big hats."
4,Know Your Umbrella Tricks,"I read all of the reviews before buying this umbrella.There really isn't another one out there, so I went for it--knowing it's not very robust and not very big. Two tricks: buy2 of them (more shade), and bend them as needed (very carefully).We rarely bend ours after the initial bend. I will reclip the umbrella to the opposite side of the wagon (during a walk where we changed directions), before I will bend it back and forth to get the shade right. I have had no problems. Thanks to the other raters' advice!"
5,Volume 3 Mind Maps were my friend.......,"I had learned about mindmaps in a class at work. This placemat has the processes for the entire PMBOK mindmapped out graphically with the inputs, tools and outputs. It's color coordinated as well for clarity. This was great to walk through the processes in my mind to see how much I understood them. The results speak for themselves.....169/200 PMP!"
3,Good starting place,"It was an easy and short read, I enjoyed the content. Was hoping for more of a shopping list then it had, but it gave me some basics.Defiantly for the novice."
5,a good upgrade,"have been using acrobat since v3,v4,v6. v8 is in line. seems a bit faster, smoother etc. have tried imitations on other machines. from a purely subjective view, acrobat is best. a bit pricey, but the best. with the usual caveats, can be installed on a desktop and a notebook, but requires a call to tech support which was quick and smooth."
1,The same awful experience.,"The ""bad serial number"" routine as the first reviewer. I'll try Adobe Customer Service when I stop fuming."
1,Mahjongg Mistake,"I ordered this game because it said I had a choice of 1500 different tiles to choose from, but the choices were very disappointing. They were many real pictures, like you would see from a clip art program, making it very hard to pick out the difference in tiles on the screen. The mouse arrow became huge, and there was no way to make it smaller. Another thing was that when a timed game was being played, it took the game a long time to process the match of the tiles, which was no good. My biggest complaint was the everytime the mouse swept over any of the tiles, it turned them a dark blue, making it very hard to see what the pictures were. If anyone is looking for a good mahjong game, I do not recommend this one."
2,Colorful,"Lots of pics of the outside of the car. The book was lacking when it came to detailed data and interiorpics. Also missing were aan abundant photos of the area under the front and rear bonnets, as well as extreme close ups."
2,thermometer,This is the second one I have owned. The first one lasted about a year. When it died I got this one to replace it. Same model as before and it didn't even last a month. Love the idea but this product just won't do the job.
2,Bootleg Quality,"It's nice to finally see a RHCP concert from the Navarro era (the DVD cover is misleading). However, this is essentially a bootleg quality DVD (below average audio/video). And, most disappointing of all, the audio is noticeably out of sync with the video, which is unforgivable for a retail product in this day and age."
4,good but deceiving,I liked the video but the date is wrong in the description. The concert is from 1994. So a lot of the songs a know weren't on the video.It was good.
2,WARNING: METRIC EDITION!,"So, yes, there are other reviews with this warning. But, I did not check them before purchasing. Duh.But, this book is ENTIRELY METRIC. Not helpful for most of us who learned hydraulics in English units. Found the 6th edition at a library and it is in English units.Otherwise, if this were not in Metric, it's a great text. Just beware."
5,Clearly Amazing LOL,"These things are fantastic! While running a preschool and day care, these items have been very valuable. Very useful item"
5,Nice laminating pouches,"These laminating pouches are good, I thought they were thicker, but nonetheless they do the job very good."
2,Disappointed,"I'm pretty sure these are the same laminating sheets I ordered last year - I loved them, thought they were an excellent value for the money and used them all up laminating stuff for preschool-at-home.Since I'm homeschooling again this year I decided to stock up. I just opened the box and used a few sheets and they're all bubbling and peeling as I handle them. I'm extremely disappointed that the things I laminate will probably fall apart before we even start using them. I considered sending the sheets through the laminating machine again to see if they would re-stick but I wasn't sure it was such a good idea."
2,Very Small,"I'm sure these work well for a toddler's glasses, but they're tiny. They don't fit my glasses, and I'd like to return them, but the seller has an onerous return policy.""Return Policy: We will exchange the product, if defective. All exchange request should be made within 3 days of receiving the product. We will not be responsible to pay for the shipping cost associated with the exchange, or refund.

4,Warren Evans....a pleasant piano piece.,Just a note. This is a great CD. If you like to hear piano solos of popular songs. Sorry other CD's aren't on this site for Warren.Won't go wrong with this CD....might wish to try Danny Wright if you like this genre of music. Relaxing and pleasant...I would buy again!
5,Great book,I recommend this book for anyone who is intrested in armor. Full of examples of construction and styles. A must have book.
3,Case is too big for the Casio Exilim Z75,This case adds more bulk than is necessary for the Z75. Need a tighter fit. Nice case for any slightly larger camera.
2,Contrary to Mainstream Science,"Seeing Beyond 20/20 is a practical guide for improving eyesight based on the notion that the eyes, like any muscles in the body, can be improved with proper exercise and nutrition. Dr. Robert-Michael Kaplan asserts that his strategies can return damaged eyes (those requiring glasses or lenses) to their full capacity.The elements of the book require acceptance of views that are contrary to mainstream science. Kaplan clearly knows the eye and does a fine job describing the biological elements; however, as with any alternative ideas, one must view with a realm of skepticism. There may be something to what Kaplan as found, although having been written in 1987 one would expect that any credible breakthroughs would have been better known by now. Added to this I did not notice any improvement using the exercises."
3,Good Tool terrible sheath,"The Tool is great, I do like it a alot, I carry it every day as a tech in the military, but...The sheath is terrible, its fit and finish looks like it was made by a 70 year old blind person with parkinson's. My company ordered 8 of these for all of our techs, every sheath is the same, they are held together with all of 5 connectors. The flaps are overlapping on the top and split apart on the bottom. The leather also smells like fish. Paladin or more importantly SOG need a better sheath."
3,The scissors suck...,"This is a nice tool. Very beefy and solidly built, but the scissors absolutely suck. Won't even cut string without the material binding up in them. How the rest of the tool could be so good, and the scissors be so bad, I dunno. Maybe they'll get better at it. Maybe not. The fold out covers pop off at the slightest provocation, but they're almost unnecessary. It also would have been much handier with at least one gizmo that would accept different bits, like some of the Leatherman tools do."
3,NOT FOR THE ATW CARGO WAGON,"Although it is listed as an accessory for the ATW Cargo wagon I bought here, it is NOT the right pad!!! THe right pad is : ""Wagon Pad Set"" listed for $44... the only one radio flyer lists as compatable for the ATW Cargo Wagon!!"
3,One of the best late Bon Jovi songs,"When I first heard ""It's My Life"", I said ""the boys are back in town"". Richie's generic talkbox guitar is all what this song's about. A rather simple song really, but makes itself heard over and over again. I had to give 3 stars, because the other songs in this SD (except Temptation) are a little lousy. Same can be said about the rest of the LP, too. But Bon Jovi made a very good decision bychoosing the most striking song as their first single. If you like the old Bon Jovi sound this one's for you."
1,Too little content,"I was disappointed by this book. There is very little valuable content, and that little is stretched and repeated on and on in order to fill more than 200 pages. All together, a boring, badly written, repetitive book."
4,Good replacement for lost game timers,"My wife and I sometimes buy vintage board games at yard sales or thrift stores and find that the original hourglass timers are often missing or broken. For just a little over $6, this item provides a nice selection of different time lengths to approximate the original timers we need to replace. When clocked against a digital stopwatch, I have found that the one and two minute timers are really pretty accurate (+/- one second in multiple tests) but the three minute timer only runs about 2:36. The original timer in my 1970s Parker Brothers version of Boggle runs 2:44, so the new one seems pretty close. In all, a nice and useful product."
1,I think this is horrible,I found this variety of Tassimo coffee pods to be undrinkable compared to some of the caffeinated varieties. It's like cheap diner coffee. Going in the garbage.
3,Good product for the price,"This lighter-like camera from Spypen isn't all that bad. Despite the drawbacks of having only 1.3 megapixels, no flash and no zoom, the benefits are pretty strong as well.It's nice and compact, lightweight and really, really, easy to use and hook up.It does the job adequately."
5,Thank you Dr. Fitzgerald,"This book is a must read for all who are interested in the integration of body/mind/spirit. Dr. Fitzgerald leads the reader through a comprehensive and in depth journey of health and healing that encompasses all three elements into an easy to follow and understand program of fundamental wellness.This book answered many questions for me and helped me to understand that I can achieve optimum health with ease, grace and a gentle progression of healthy lifestyle and dietary changes that I can live with and incorporate into my life.I now understand the importance of keeping my body tuned and free of toxins, and how to do that. It empowered me take dominion over the harmonious interaction of my body/mind/spirit for a greater sense of wellbeing and joy."
2,More Like Lasting Thirteen To Fifteen Days . . .,"The product works well, but I'd have to say that advertising each cartridge as lasting for one month is a bit off. I've gone through cartridges like crazy. They recommend cleaning it every day but I tried to make it last longer than one per month by cleaning it every other day. Unfortunately, I've only been able to get from thirteen to fifteen cleanings per cartridge. That makes it even more expensive if you're talking a years' supply. In other words, I'm going to run out way before a year is up and that's using it half the time. Hmmm! I may have to re-think about re-ordering when this ""years' supply"" of carts runs out."
2,Eclectic disaster,"On a scale of 1-10...i give this a poor rating for many reasons and do not recommend this video to anyone who is a serious authentic dancer. The performances are lifeless...the dancers and their background participants try too hard to achieve a certain exotic Arabian motif, however, truly fail to capture the cultural spirit. Also, there is such an eclectic mirage of dance technique from other cultures that it takes the dance performances out of the genre of middle-east. Poor lighting, poor performance, and poor video quality give this video a very poor rating."
1,Dont be fooled by its quality looks!,"This is a toy by any camera standards, the ""lens"" is a very small opening that is fixed focus like a disposable camera, poor quality design all around. Fake buttons, extra controls that are purely for looks and not function. Its a very basic camera.Its like those old VW beetle car kits that make them look like a Rolls Royce"
3,The hose is not quite...,fit to the wall faucet (short hose). Weird angle and it bends. I have to take them apart to restore it.
4,NO UNSIGHTLY GARDEN HOSES NEAR WATER!,"My husband has a fish cleaning station near the lake in our backyard. Although the actual cleaning station is tastefully constructed with a stucco base, the garden hose always lay untidy on the ground. We researched for a hose reel pot with lid that would withold the salt water, wind and rain. The Suncast 50-Foot Capacity Garden Hose Reel Pot Taupe HRP60 had all of the qualities we were looking for. We ordered the pot, it arrived promptly with no damage and it blends nicely into our outdoor setting. We use a 25ft hose, although a 50ft would fit. We have had salt water sprays, wind and rain since the hose pots arrival. The lid is protective and the water is easily drained by the drilled drain holes. Did I mention, the price is great, too. Definitely would order, again. -ABW"
3,Not the most comfortable costume out there,"I bought this costume to wear last halloween. First, the fabric is screen printed polyester. This wouldn't be a problem, except that the dress was very wrinkled and I couldn't get the wrinkles out. The iron had to be such low heat that it was ineffective, and the steamer didn't touch the wrinkles. Also, the hat is simply a real game spinner board with an elastic band attached. It wouldn't stay on my head, even with bobby pins, so I wore the spinner as massively huge bracelet. The ties in the back of the dress hit me at bust level, which did very little to add shape to the sack-like dress. I cut the ties off and added a red patent belt to emphasize my waist. All in all, it wasn't a terrible costume, but I wouldn't wear it twice."
2,not for handicaps,This software was useless to me. I am handicap but with `good' speech. It could not recognize my speech.The headset which comes with this product is made in China. It is too small for a `average sized' American male with average length of hair.All sound functions of the Mac are disabled by this software.Native Spanish speakers were able to use this [speaking English].
5,Cat glucosamine,This is a hard to find item so ordering it here is quick and easy. I received my product promptly.
4,Who would have known?,"I first bought The ugly organ, and listened to it in awe. So i proceeded back and bought Domestica. This is an excellent album. The reason i gave it only 4 stars, is because it does have its weak points in a couple of songs that are very cliche'. (comparing to the other cds) All- in all, If i were justing starting into Cursive i would buy this cd, and then proceed with Burst and Bloom Ep...and on."
5,Winder,"One thing that the post here don't mention and I forgot is the fact that an auto wind ( Think the 11 as well as the 12 ) will work, Not that a new person would wish .. But used here are in the 85-125 range just a point this is a Nikon and not a .. .. . \ I have added 2 extra lenses to it.. way better than a .."
5,If you like higher mathematics and physics of E&M,This is a very detailed book on E&M with all the necessary higher math to understand the physical principles. Much detail is devoted to making sure the reader fully understand all the mathematical symbols. Item arrived in good condition and on time.
2,More information necessary to make this a better book!,"I am enrolled in the upper division sequence of Electromagnetism as a physics major. I, along with most others in my class agree that the book needs more examples, and at least the odd numbered problems need to be printed in the back of the book. We need to study more examples to learn technique. When we attempt to solve the problem sets, we have no idea whether or not we're getting the right answers. The layout of the book is okay, and the text is written in a ""matter of fact"" informal style which I find unique and uncommon in textbooks of this type- but I feel I need to buy another textbook to make up for the other shortcomings."
2,Where's the Physics?,"While physics is heavily bounded to mathematics, it is not an excuse to set aside all intuition, reason, and common sense. Sometimes, a moment of thought can go along way in solving a problem rather than grinding out the long math. Griffith seems to have no respect for the use of reason. All his solutions, examples, and explanations are a result of calculating some integral and reading off the result. No time is spent in its interpretation or whether this is a reasonable answer. Jackson goes much further in this respect.An an introduction to electricity and magnetism I recommend Purcell. His style is based on thinking through the physics and then applying the math. Even then, he rederives certain mathematical ideas from a physics perspective giving an even greater understanding of the subject.Unfortunately, Griffith is not even a completely mathematically rigorous text. So, we have very little physics, a slop of math and no real discussion. You can see the consequences."
4,Three and half stars,"It is a solid military science fiction novel, but it was an amazing by no means. While I do think I will continue to read the series, it's not a top priority for me."
2,Disapointed,"If you have read Star Ship Troopers, than don't waste your time with this book. It is just about the same book. I wanted to like it. For something to change and turn the book around. But sadly it did not. Even the name of the foe was not too different from SST, from bugs to slugs. I was waiting for the line ""You want to live forever"" to pop up. I would pass this book by and if you would like a book like this one only better read (not watch the movie but really read) star ship troopers"
5,Awesome!,"This book, and the entire 5 part series, is probably my favorite book at the moment. In total, I have read a book in this series 15 times so about 3 times per book. I love the combination of military-scifi-adventure-badassery provides. I love these novels so much, I got Mr. Buettner to autograph each copy."
3,Get the one with the dumping trailer!,"I got this one for me, ant the one with the dumping trailer for my nephews. That one's more fun, I believe. This one's OK, but the movement isn't very engaging for our young'un."
5,Great,It was just what i needed to remote mount my Bose Speakers with regular speaker wire ran through the walls. Worked great.
3,These closing arguments are social history.,"As a lawyer I thought that this might be interesting as a ""how to book."" It is not that kind of book. It is a sort of ""coffee table book"" that I was glad to get as a gift. The closing arguments are interesting for the way the lawyer ""pitched"" a case to the jury. They reflect the social milieu out of which the cases arose. I read it in bits for the sheer fun of recalling our social history."
4,"Nice strap, would buy again","The look of this strap is very nice. It has a sharp appearance that blends in with my Sunburst Strat without looking drastic to distract you from the guitar.It's very comfortable, and adjustable to virtually any length you could want.The fabric has a slight tendency to buckle a little, so its not a perfectly flat strap... but it is nicely padded, so I guess thats why it buckles. This is not a problem, though. I like this stap a lot and would buy it again."
2,Disappointing,I was really looking forward to watching this DVD since I am a big fan of the the Notre Dame production with Bruno Pelletier. But there are NO sub-titles on this DVD. I wish this was made more clear before I ordered it.
4,A master story teller...Kudos to Ms. Cleage.,"Pearl Cleage is a master story teller as is evident in this collection of short stories. She weaves interesting tales that masterfully explore the often explored topic of racism. Though an often explored topic, Ms. Cleage handles it with expertise that lends itself to a wonderful product. We see deep into her characters and how their personal self images interweave with interactions with the outside world to form various ""shades"" of racism and self perception.This is a short collection...but oh so sweet."
3,Super Play Action Football for SNES - Review,This is a relatively fun game if you have two players. The graphics are a little weak but nevertheless a good solid and competitive bit of football.
1,Piller not a doozie,"The pillar is too long for my hand. Shorter might work, except my pill is tiny and falls out of the piller tip. The rubber tip is too loosey-goosey."
4,Great value!!!,"I was in the middle of planning a BBQ and needed a volleyball set. I looked around at local sporting goods stores and was disappointented with the selection. The lower end sets had plastic poles and doubled as a badmitten set. I'm an intermediate player and the park where the BBQ was serious players are about. I would have been embarassed to have set up an inferior set. However, I need something that had both quality and value. With only a few days to the BBQ I found this set. I was familiar with the Park & Sun brand and was estatic to see this set was so inexpensive. I received the set in 2 days and am very pleased with the quality and ease of setup. If you are a weekend player and need set that is both affordable, quality, and not embarissing this is the set."
1,uncessarily confusing,"The Hangul script has got to be one of the most logical and one of the easiest written languages to learn. I cannot believe any serious student of the Korean language would not first invest the time needed to learn the written script. Thus I find a book on Korean grammar using Romanization of Korean words to be uncessarily confusing. I have been eagerly searching for a thorough book on Korean grammar in English; this book however, was of limited use."
5,Great stocking stuffer,"I ordered this book and was so pleased, I just ordered two more to give as Christmas gifts. Wonderful book!"
5,Pop ups are cool,Kids love pop-ups and my son Miquel who is 6 loves this very much and it educates him as well. Very highly recommended
4,Absolute necessity,I've been working on home wiring projects for 25 years. I bought this book to catch me up with the times. It includes all the information a person could use to install new and old wiring in a home. The pictures are highly detailed and easy to follow. The book includes most - not all - situations you will find in a home. Buy it. You won't regret it.
5,Loved It!,"I read this book in one day and it was great. I read a lot fo romance novels, christian and mainstream. Victor told a story of faith, patience, love, support, friendship and God's love for us. I enjoyed the book and I will recommend it to my friends"
5,Excellent soundtrack,"An excellent soundtrack have always considered it one of James Horner's best and one of my favourites. Some of the tracks do resemble the soundtrack of Apollo 13 so if you enjoy this one I recommend listening to Apollo 13 as well. The inclusion of acoustic and electric guitars throughout the score gives it a very unique and different sound to other Horner soundtracks. Throughout the album there is a good contrast of melody, the last song sung by John Mellencamp blends in well with the rest of the album."
4,"Qualified with James standard, not his best work though","A big budget movie about a disaster on the sea, some drama and a lot of specail effect. Sound familiar? But The Perfect Storm is not Titanic and 'Yours Forever' is not 'My Heart Will Go On' This score is similar with Titanic. Start beautifully, then the music grow faster, the voice grow louder, arousing with more tension. Then it ends beautifully again. The work qualify with James Horner standard but it's not his best work. If you are a real James Horner fan, go buy it. If you just knew about James Horner or a new listener of soundtrack, go buy Titanic score instead (if you still don't have one)."
5,Perfect is the right word!!!,I really enjoy this cd. Only one song with words but it's a great song. The Music really goes along with the movie. If you've seen the movie I'd recomend the cd.
2,Superficial,"Sorry, but this is too superficial for most users. I have been looking for some type of technical writing manual for a group of people who need some training. This is a series of to-do lists with no how-to's. There is a lot of prose and how Michael Bremer likes to do things, but he writes as though everyone has the skills, and they simply need a refresher of all of the tips that are already on the internet. BTW - the author worked at Maxis which could explain why the cover includes a glowing review from Maxis founder. While I would like someone to buy my copy - it has no markings! - I can't really recommend spending the money."
2,Don't bother,"-I didn't find any additional information in this book than the other technical writing books that I have encountered.-It is a beginner book like the Complete Idiots Guide, but less information."
2,Book title mislead readers,"I bought this book hoping this book would provide me `do and don't list' on technical writing, but it did not deliver its' promise, confidently exhibited on the book's title...""How to Write About Technical Subjects and Products So Anyone Can Understand."" The contents in the book is good, however, they broadly discuss the `technical writing' profession, not 'how to write....' I suggest author to change the title of the book so it does not mislead readers."
4,A Very Strong Woman...,"The title character of Walter Keady's novel is a strong women who resists the pressures of the Catholic Church as vehemently as she does those of small town gossips. As a former nun circa 1950 who becomes pregnant, and refuses to name the father, Mary McGreevy is decades ahead of her time. The results of her actions are simultaneously comical and infuriating. While some of her best friends suffer the consequences of her choices, they stick by her and are all the better for it. ""Mary McGreevy"" is a wonderful book that I would recommend very highly."
5,EDGE memory - 256 MB - DIMM 168-pin - SDRAM,"The RAM worked as expected. It was immediately recognized by the PC. And the PC performance was noticably improved. The price was fair. It was certainly worth the effort to make this upgrade, and the EDGE RAM worked well. The vendor selling this product was prompt with completing the transaction and shipping the product. I have purchased several products via [...]. In each case the vendors they promoted to me were economical and prompt."
2,"Neat idea, great plot, horrible execution","The book's premise was fascinating to me (prolly because I'm a longtime pro wrestling fan with a huge interest in all the backstage stuff). And the book started off well too. But by page 20 the writing (specifically the dialogue) had sank to a sixth-grade level and it was growing tiresome to read page after page of poor writing. I'd like to see what someone like Dean Koontz, Stephen King, or someone else with a good level of writing talent could have done with the plot...this could have been great. But as it is, this book is sadly, medicore. Don't waste your money."
1,buy it from a salon,"This is a very good product in principle, I really like using it - it makes fine colored hair look and feel fantastic. However, the stuff I got from Amazon seems to be inferior quality than the same shampoo that I used to get in the salon. Hair has a distinct greasy afterfeel. Even though it's a good deal on Amazon, I won't buy it again from here."
1,Francis has taken it all back and admits the right-wing agenda is destructive,"This is from 1982 folks. It is 2009 and America is still here and will remain here. Francis Schaeffer's newest book called ""Crazy for God"" admits that the christian right has mis-guided America and he claims that he and his father are partly responsible for the nomiminations of Bush Sr and Jr. and that they have been utter and blatent wrong choices for presidency.The Crazy for God book is very powerful and Francis finally admits that the evangelical scene is nothing but cults of personality and many are riding that Jesus-cash cow all the way to the bank.So any works by this man before his last is all rubbish and fear-induced, paranoia designed to cause christians to further divide this country as they have done in the last decade ever so sharply.Francis just does not tell the truth in his former books even though it may seem like it is all good. He admitted it himself, just read Crazy for God."
3,average compared to Two Mrs. Grenvilles!,"Read this right after finishing The Two Mrs. Grenvilles....so a bit disappointed. Lacking the great detail used previously, also not very suspensful (if it's supposed to be...) Managed to get through it.....liked the much deserved ridicule of hypocritcal, wealthy families such as the ""Bradleys"" and the parallels to real life events, facts."
5,Excellent book!,"I am only half-way completed with this book and it is absolutely incredible! It is of the sort that is so hard to put down! In that it is based on the Moxley murder, it is written prior to the trial of Michael Skakel, so it does go with the assumption of Tommy Skakel being the murderer. Both boys had been suspected of the murder. All the names have been changed, of course, as well as the addition of characters/deletion of others. You will not be disappointed in reading this book."
3,So-so for bread machines (and advice from the manufacturer),"Based on another review, I purchased this yeast for use in my bread machine. I don't proof the yeast in advance -- I just put it in as if it were bread machine yeast. This does work, but with some adjustments. For instance, a 1.5 lb loaf of bread needs a bit over 1 Tablespoon of this yeast. It also requires a bit over double amount of the recommended gluten in the recipe. But once I got this all figured out, it works pretty well!Some things to keep in mind that the manufacturer says on their website:- They store this yeast in refrigeration, even when unopened, and advise us to do the same- 1 Tablespoon of this yeast is equivalent to the little packets that you buy in the grocery store."
3,Intimate Personal Interview,"This is 30-minute DVD is an intimate personal interview with Edward Steichen at age 85. It is about the man, not about his career in photography nor about his work in photography's many genres. As such, it will disappoint someone looking for a review of the works. It's about the man, not the works, and gives some good insight into his creative mind."
4,good enough,"this thing is good enough as a 4gb thumb drive at a decent price. however, the freaking u3 thing on it is retarded and a waste of space. I can't seem to get it completely deleted off of the thumb drive. and you have to stop the u3 device everytime before you can eject the driive itself. it's like two different things. also i never figured out any benifit of the u3 device because it seems the only help it offers it transfer of info which is too easy without u3."
3,"Good part, but is not compatible with Vista","The flash drive works great with Windows XP, but is virtually unusable with Windows Vista. With Vista, files cannot be seen, and transfering files is extremely slow if not impossible. The Kingston flash drives are compatible with both operating systems and more."
1,never received,"I never received this product and only received a refund when I asked a week after I was supposed to receive it, where it was."
1,A Waste Of Money,"I bought this on sale at Best Buy for $30.00 The information on the disk made it seem as though you could use it for software on different computers. I bought it for my Hallmark card software. Simplicity? I think not. With 4 GB of space I was sure that the card software would work from this drive. NOT. It seems that only U3 programs work with this so called ""travel disk"". Wish I'd never wasted my money on it. I wish I would have known about the U3 issue. I thought it was a 4 GB drive that I could use with ANY software. It hangs up my brand new VISTA computers (desktop AND laptop."
5,"Excellent Storage Device, don't be scared of U3","I was apprehensive when I read all the reviews about U3. I simply wanted a reliable storage device and nothing else. As soon as I connected the usb drive, I removed the U3 launchpad and technology. It took a total of 1 minute and it was done. No more U3 and I have an excellent 4 GB drive for 23 bucks. Same drive sells at retail for over 40. I run windows xp and it was no problem at all to remove the U3. I can see how it may look overwhelming with all the programs/apps, but one or two clicks of a button and it was gone. I highly recommend this drive to anyone looking for a place to store music, docs, pictures, etc...."
3,Works Like It Should- But be wary,"This is just a normal flash drive. It comes with the U3 software on its own partition, which is useful, but it does not work on a mac. Unless you reformat the disk from scratch, it will recreate the five or six folders it comes preinstalled with, even if you don't want them. Also, this is a high power USB device. It does not work on low power docking stations, like the Mac aluminum keyboard. The slider hold fairly well, but the head will often retract if you don't push it out enough. It is also a bit ""chunky"". Okay for general use."
3,Great for the price,I just received mine today. I'm not sure with the big deal with the U3 is but if you by pass it then you don't have to worry about it. I was interested in a thumb drive with the slider because I always loose the tops and then I like the fact it has a key chain. I hope it lasts a long time. I'll update this later on with a better review.
5,Great Product!,"I think SanDisk provides the most reliable flash drive around. I had one from another company, and all my backups are gone."
4,Storing Your Life Away,"These days, when it comes down to computers, everybody is looking for a simple and easy way to store all your files on one format. While we've stored them onto floppy disks and CD-ROM disks, there are few ways that we can bring them on the go that can be as simple. This Sandisk Flash Drive handles very well, by allowing you to bring your biggest files that are more easily secured here, inc;luding music and media downloads from MP3 music files, to work projects that take up much more space that youn use for Excel and Movies and videos from Itunes. It handles the job very well, and is sturdy to tag along, at an affordable price. While there have been others that I've tried, SanDisk does the job very well, and I absolutely recommend this for your home computer or your laptop a whole lot.Price: BConvience: BOverall: B"
1,Rob D.,"This was the first one of these that I've ever bought. I'm not sure if I did something wrong or what, but this thing was junk, didn't work, and was a wsste of money"
5,Excellent Drive,"The drive does come with software that I don't use, but it doesn't mean I won't use it since some people do use it. The software is not compatible with Vista but since I don't use it, I don't care. It's not much of an inconvenience and I haven't had any problems with the device.Only reason I'm writing this review is that I was amazed by the quality of this product. I lost it in my laundry hamper, and it unfortunately went through a heavy cycle in the washer and later on a heated cycle through the dryer. I thought the device was toast and my files lost, but that wasn't the case. My files are in tact and I'm still using the same drive a month later (hope it doesn't fail, but if it does, at least I'll know why)."
2,Not ReadyBoost Compatible!,I have Vista Ultimate running on a HP Pav Media edition home pc. The drive works but the ReadyBoost is not active. I was really hoping to use RB but was disappointed. The drive as storage works fine but again NO RB.
3,Slooooooow,"Well, it's cheap, for 4 GB.But, it's also very slow, around 3 MB/s Write speed. 25 minutes to fill it up. Outrageous.Read speed is above 20 MB/s.Still, I would not buy a second one, when you can buy a class 4 or class 6 MicroSD card and an adapter for the same price, and you can get better write performance with that combination, in a smaller form factor."
1,It doesnt load!!!!,"I bought this Flash Drive for my son. At first it was very good. But when the new drive came out it didn't allow me to open it. I had to download to new drive. After I download it :1. It formatted the drive2. My son put his Science Fair folder in and then erased it.3. Tried on another computer, there was no folderITS EVIL"
4,Informative,Enjoyed this presentation. Can't really see difference between cubed foot gardening and square foot gardening.
4,Why no DVD?,"This may have been ""cheesy camp"" back in the day, but as a 5-year old kid back in the mid-60's and seeing the part where the teenagers are driving down a remote road at night and the car's headlights come upon one of those big-eyed creatures...well, it scared the HECK out of me! To this day, I'll drive down a darkened road and get flashbacks of those little bug-eyed monsters.Count me as another who'd buy the DVD...if it existed."
1,Waste Of Time!,"This film could have been a great scifi horror film if it was taken seriously. Instead of horror we get an attempt at humor. For its time the alien creatures in it are terrifying. I'm also noticing as of late that there were very few creature flicks that had creatures on other planets that were actually exciting films. Most of the movies where Earth rocket ships go to the moon or Mars or Venus or other planets never had enough monsters. They all had humanoids or beautiful ladies or tacky humor. One of the few that had strange and terrifying creatures was The Angry Red Planet which is not only scary but also well acted and entertaining. Some of them started well and seemed really scary like; ""Journey To The Seventh Planet"", and then as it progresses it turns out women are living there on Uranus and the whole story switches from scifi to romance. It ruined the entire film and it had such a creepy start. Oh well don't waste your money on ""Saucer Men."""
4,MORE GREAT STUFF!!,"Yet another true niche classic, this one has everything: little green men, rebelious teens, alcohol, disbelieving (initially) adults, cars. PLEASE release this on DVD soon!!!"
4,Very nice first novel,"I enjoyed this novel very much. It was, admittedly, a tad slow at first and I found myself alternately putting it down and picking it up again. It's an imaginative tale with rich descriptions and interesting characterizations. I very much liked the relationship between the protagonist and his male lover but wish they had gotten together earlier in the novel. There's no awkward gender bias and it's very lovely. I gave it a 4 out of 5 because the ending was very unnatural and abrupt; almost out of place. (I hope that Mr. Pinto decides to continue this loving relationship between the two characters, without introducing a female heroine, which seems to be the cop out these days. I'll have to check out the last page of the next novel. That will decide whether I shell out the big bucks for another hardcover that cops out and disappoints.)"
4,"Breathtaking, pure and simple...","I have to admit, as I sit here pondering what to say in this my first review, that I wasn't sure I liked the book in the beginning... but, as the world unfolded and the characters began to emerge I found myself fascinated and entranced by the pictures Mr. Pinto painted.Although the story seemed to move slowly, I was never bored and found myself eagerly finding time during my day to sit down and read. Marvelous images and breathtaking vistas unfolded around Carnelian as he moved out of his small, remote home into a vast world of unfamiliar culture, politics and intrigue. The culture of The Chosen is a fascinating one, even if it is on the gruesome side.I eagerly await the next step in Carnelian's journey!"
2,Like Reading Swiss Cheese,"I'll admit that I hoped that the book was as good as the cover. It was slow goings, but I hoped that this was just a pressure build/ world build into something great. It ended up being a bad potpourri of ideas that left me unimpressed. In fact the end of this book has become a joke among my reading group to indicate a bad book.There were quite a number of plot issues; the main character suddenly being homosexual (I don't car if he is, but not out of the blue), unneeded politics and to much twisted minds. I really wanted this to be something grand; like Robin Hobb, Carol Berg, or CS Friedman, but no. I couldn't even get through book two.This series is like reading Swiss Cheese - all holes no substanceI gave it two stars because it had so much potential."
5,waltons book,i ordered this book Goodnight John Boy.. it has soo much info in about each story line in the series.. anyone who likes watching The Waltons should have this book. takes me back to the days when it was first one and everyone watched The Waltons..
5,Excellent New Mystery,"I highly recommend this book. I prefer mysteries written by women and I now have a new writer to add to my list of favorites. The book is well written, engrossing, and full of interesting characters, including and especially Schaeffer Brown herself. The author has a distinctive voice and a wonderful eye for detail. I hope that this is the first of a long line of Schaeffer Brown mysteries.JH (Washington, DC)"
2,Doesn't last,"Installed on my Tundra a little over two years ago. Basic homeowner and outdoor use, nothing particularly tough. The cover started falling apart about a year ago. Fasteners disappearing, rails coming loose, cover bowing. This is a cool design, but it just does not last. Skimpy 1-year warranty adds insult to injury."
1,wait for a hail storm and your money is gone,"did not get any dents on my truck, but my cover is a wreck. not worth filing on my insurance. I loved the look before the hail, but now my black f150 looks like a mess with this cover."
1,BAK Poor Customer Service,"I have the G2 for Silverado and found myself needing the rails only so I can install on my truck. The company first tells you they will sell the rails but not directly...only through distributor, but when I found a distributor they called to get part number and were told (from company owner) that they don't sell the rails separately. Buy from someone else!"
2,Nice dryer ... but doesn't last,"I bought mine 9/2007. Nice small size with both heating and temperature settings ... however it starting making a strange sound in Dec / Jan. It blew up the first of Feb. It still runs, but there are parts rattling around and it cannot be used. Something must've broke loose. Now I guess I'll see how their 2 yr warranty holds up ...."
3,"Comfortable, but didn't last.","I've had this chair for almost two years. Got it at an excellent price and it wasn't too hard to put together. A few months back one of the wheels fell off and won't go back on because the part of the chair that holds the wheels on is broken. Disappointing, but I guess I can't complain too much because of the price."
5,Hasn't lost a step,"I first read this book back in 1998 when I was heavily influenced by Guy's entrepreneurial Rules for Revolutionaries/Kick But campaign. I have since referred to it often for its sheer enthusiasm and many inspirational insights in different areas of business.12 years later I find myself in charge of Imagination Technologies' developer programme POWERVR Insider - much the same function as Guy had in Apple when he gathered the experiences furnishing the pages of this book. With the professional insights and experiences of my position, I can testify, this book (still) rocks! Like everybody else I would love an updated version, but the old, worn and annotated one, never strays far from my desk - and for good reason: Guy's no-nonsense approach and the timeless principles of evangelism have been the cornerstone of so many, many success stories in my position."
1,Painfully bad,"I hope I don't confuse John Evans too much by saying that his first review was dead-on. This book, which deals with a history and subject I usually love to read about, constitutes bad fiction writing, period. No character in this book is a convincing, flesh-and-blood person. There's no sensory engagement, no movement, no developed scenes, nothing except a lot of dull, pretentious, abstract drivel. And I would not call this an example of creative postmodernism, either. Cowan would have been better off writing a non-fiction work -- at least it would have been a less embarrassing read."
2,too large,This unit is too large to be used effectively at my desk.It does hold the paperwork but just doesn't work for me.
1,Does not smell like original product,"My wife loves this perfume but when she tried it, it did not smell like the original at all. It was actually kind of gross, big disappointment."
5,A must buy for the busy manager,I am a busy man with a large library. This is the book I pull out the most often. It is well referenced too with a useful bibliography. The only downside is that it is 4 years old. I look forward to the sequel with insights into management of web contact.
2,Legends of Wimbledon - Pete Sampras,"Be careful guys.. this DVD has some region code, and not playable in all DVDs."
4,champion ducks,"as a ducks fan from england its great to have this dvd in my collection.with the stanley cup win fresh in people`s minds though, maybe a bit more attention could have been paid to the regular season! still its the ducks making history so its great to see. as a fan you`ve got plenty of interviews and behind the scenes to watch enjoy plus of course the post season games highlights are there as well. i`ve watched the dvd 4 times to date and it is still making the hair on the back of my neck stand up when scotty lifts the cup! this has got to be a must own for fans of the ducks and maybe worth a view for hockey fans in general, can`t wait for the ducks to come to london and make some more history."
1,Delivers much less than it promises,I expected to see in this book an explanation on the most prevalent schemes of laundering. Instead it dedicated most of the book to describe what is happening in different countries of the world in terms of laws and law enforcement. This information is not what the title and the subtitle promise. The information presented could be gathered from different sources over the internet but most importantly such information can become obsolete in no time (the book is published in 1998). The best thing about this book is its title but unfortunately it did not meet my expectations at all.
4,Entertaining--but weird,"I bought this anime for my 7 year old daughter. She seems to enjoy it. The language is not really bad (no major swear--like ""F"" or SH words). Usually, I watch with her and let her know which words are not appropriate for children. There is some violence. This show is not for younger children. If you enjoy anime like Pretear, Tsubasa, Totoro, Spirited Away, CardCaptor Sakura etc you may enjoy this. We bought the first episode to see if we liked it before we bought the set. This refers to the digital version --through Amazon unbox."
2,Subtitles??,"There's no information on Amazon's instant view/digital page as to whether buying the digital version gets you the option to have subtitles. The preview is dubbed, so I'll assume that buying the digital version means you're stuck with dubbed only and have no ability to use subtitles and Japanese dialog instead. So no sale.Amazon, please provide this metadata for digital content so your customers can make an informed purchase. Both you and Netflix seem to hide this info as if it's irrelevant, but in reality it's the difference between a sale or no sale. Netflix appears to be dubbed only, so why don't y'all offer the option for subtitles? As it stands, I can't buy any anime digital content because there's either no metadata provided or it appears to be dubbed only. Please fix this. I know anime fans have been asking Netflix for years to provide subtitle options so I'm sure they've been asking you too."
4,"Not what I expected, but still beautiful","When I ordered this ring, I expected a possibility of cheap metal, and a pink stone. The quality of metal I received was quite nice. However, the stone was not pink at all, it looks like a faux diamond/CZ. If you don't mind not getting the color expected, I would say go for it. This ring has held up, while wearing it everyday and even not taking it off when I shower, it shows no signs of ware, the band looks great and the stone is set very securely! Great quality!"
1,Not for fine hair!,I hate these rollers. I have fine hair and I can't get them to stay in my hair. The clips keep falling out. It is very hard to get the clip exactly right so that it stays in. Defnitey wouldn't recommend these.
1,Rollers won't stay in!,"Absolutely awful product - who designed this? The rollers are too heavy to stay in with the flimsy pins, the pins won't fit around rollers with HAIR on them, and you constantly have to fight to get the rollers back on their ""plugs"" in the case. The size is perfect for traveling, the rollers work if you have enough scaffolding but it is a complete pain to use - buy something else!"
2,The clips do not fit the rollers!,I like the travel size for sure. They heat up quickly and they get hot enough to make a decent surl BUT I will never buy these again because the clips do not fit the large rollers! At all. They will not go in all the way to hold the roller securely. Buy another set.
3,Nice rollers.,Sent these back. They look good but just too small for my long hair!! the case looked nice and good for travel or home use.Just a little too small.
3,NOT EX LARGE CURLERS,"I haven't used these curlers yet. I ordered them for traveling because the ones I have at home are too bulky. But the description says 5 large/ 5 extra large. This is not an accurate description. They are more like medium and small. I use hot curlers to tame my naturally curly hair and need extra large for the top layer of hair and large for the bottom. I can tell these are going to give me those ""cutesy"" little curls instead of smooth body. They are the size of all hot curlers from the early 80's."
2,"COULD be great, but it's not","I've had one of these heat roller sets for years, and the heating elements finally gave out, so I ordered a new set. Sadly, the clips in the new set, that keep the rollers in the hair, are shorter than the old clips, and the rollers don't stay in very well. I wish I hadn't gotten rid of the old clips."
2,A little disappointed,"The curlers in this product are better described as medium and small, so they are a challenge for longer hair.Also, they don't seem to heat evenly, so playing around to get them all up to temperature wastes some time -precious time when getting ready for work or other appointments. Also the clips do not hold the curler in well.I would hesitate about recommending these, as I will soon be replacing the set I purchased just a few months ago."
2,Disappointing product,I will admit that my hair is on the short side but I still expected to get curl or additional body from these rollers. I've had neither and am quite disappointed.
5,Great for travel!,"For everyday use, I use the Remington Pearl heated clip curlers, which I love, but the unit is really large. I travel quite a bit, so I was looking for something small and functional... and this is it! It is very compact and light-weight. It heats right up in about 5 minutes. If the curlers are not heating up, but sure that they are connecting properly at the base (check that the prongs are properly aligned and press the curler down to ensure a good connection). I had no problem getting the curlers to stay in my hair with the provided pins. I have medium-thick hair, and I can get by with the 10 curlers without having to re-heat them and curl my hair in sections. I find that these (compared to the R. Pearl unit) need to heat up a little longer, stay in my hair a little longer, and (obviously) there are far fewer curlers, so maybe this unit is not great for everyday use, but it is an excellent choice for travel! Highly recommended!"
1,NOT THE BEST,I was hoping this product would be good for travel or even keeping in my office for quick styling. It appeared to be defective in that only the two curlers on the end heated up after several minutes. These curlers are much much smaller than they appear in the pictures. If you have short hair and get a set that works properly it would be a good deal for you the case and pin holder compartment is a good functional concept.
4,Remington Hot Rollers,"The compact size is wonderful and the rollers heat up very quickly. However, dissapointed in the clips for the rollers...they do not hold in place, the curlers drop out in seconds. I am looking for clamp style clips to replace them."
2,"not good for thick, hard to curl hair","The size of the curlers and the overall packaging is great or else I would have given these one star, but for me they just didn't work. The tiny bumps on the curlers do nothing to help hold the hair onto the curlers. I have relatively thick hair that is cut to my shoulders and these did absolutely nothing to curl it. I got a tiny bit of body out of them but no real curl whatsoever. Very disappointed."
4,Very good product,"I love this product, and it is my first experience with hot roller.I give this set 4 stars, because I expected large rollers to be really large, but they are not. However, my hair look very healthy, and cute! Heats very fast, and it is simple to use. Rollers stay in place."
2,Disney Cheated!,"Yep - this is a huge rip-off. Two old episodes from their morning series on Disney and one new one, and Disney calls it a ""Triple-length Feature""? It's bad enough that they only put out a new episode on the Disney Channel every six weeks or so - my kids are going nuts! And they were so dissapointed in this DVD! They thought they were getting another feature-length movie like the first. I do not recommend this DVD. Instead, just watch the morning show!"
1,Agree It's a rip off!,"We were eagerly awaiting the new Little Einsteins seeing there is so few things released for this show. I was very dissapointed and upset when I opened the DVD and found out that it is 3 episodes, 2 of which are tv episodes played all the time. No where on the outside of the box does it say this. They call it Triple length adventure which makes it sound like one long episode.Totally dissapointed at Disney for doing this, and I will be calling the phone number the other reviewer posted."
3,Usually Awesome,My son (2 1/2 years) has enjoyed Little Einstein's for quite some time. I was disappointed to find 3 episodes that we had seen. This one is collecting dust in our house. I have noticed that the first movie has also been reduced to 2 episodes now seen on TV.That's the way it goes sometimes.
1,Way too difficult for children,"While the original Rayman game is great, I was very dissapointed in this version. The game is supposed to be geared for children ages 6-7, but it takes a near expert to even get through the levels. Instead of having difficulty learning the material presented, our children were just frustrated that they did not have enough skill to play the game."
5,Good ginger,"Some pieces are dark and stringy (still edible) - but for the price, I will buy again and again!"
1,Don't you believe it!,"The Alexandrian and Gardnerian trads are two completely different systems- they would never publish a Book of Shadows together. When I showed this to some well-known, respected Gardnerians, they laughed."
1,A Gardnerian HPS,"LMAO- If the person who wrote this book is gonna sign it and is from AZ. Sounds like Rik is up to his old tricks. Trust me, any who think any of that Phooy is Gardnerian material, I pitty you."
3,Thought I would get faster results.,"I could tell that the product was working after a couple weeks, but I thought I would get faster results. Maybe you would get faster results if you were in the sun all the time. I am getting darker as the weeks go by. Other people are noticing the difference too. Overall I think that I would buy this product again and then try to spend more time in the sun and see if that works any better."
1,Pass,"The first book wasn't bad. The second was forgettable. Finally the third, well, let's put it this way. I hate not being able to finish a book no matter how bad. But in this case I made the exception.The plot is about as thin as that from a nineties computer game and the characters are equally as flimsy. It's not bad, just boring. I found myself yearning for other fantasy books such as The King's Blade or a good Salavtore book."
4,Update for newer Macs available,"For those of us that purchased Systemworks for Mac 3.0 before the end of January and have newer Macs that could not be started from the Norton CD, Norton now has an updated CD. If you qualify, they will ship it to you at no charge. The new disk works and I now give the program 4 stars."
2,Wireless printing problems,"After a bit of sweat I've managed to get the printer working fine from both my XP and MAC OS Tiger computers ...... until I unplug the direct ethernet cable to the router that is needed for set-up. Then nothing happens i.e. no wireless printing.I suspect it's an IP addressing issue having read a helpful article here (take note D-link - Amazon is becoming a better support site than your own!). Changing the IP address messes up my internet connection during install; the MAC works quite hard to re-establish the internet connection & perhaps this breaks the connection to the printer? I dunno, but it's giving me a headache.Documentation & troublshooting help are very, very weak & time will tell if D-link on-line support are any better (22 hours & no response from them yet....)I'm sure network wizards will have this little beasty up & running in no time, but for normal people it's, well, a bit of a pain."
2,"Too Much Fluff, not enough substance","While I did find a few bits of information that will actually be usefull in raising ""Sea Monkeys"" this book is more like a fan zine. Too many pages are wasted on a band called the Sea Monkeys who have little to say about the actual hobby, or a role playing game based on Sea Monkeys that I'm never going to play (or even finsish reading the rules of). The rest is the authors goofy jokes which is welcome along side practical information and historical information but on the majority of the pages here it is the humor alone and it gets old quickly.The art too is very zine-ish, which is to say it looks cut and paste and the same graphics are used over and over.A peak at the author's website reveals another poorly organized and amateurish effort. Of course, it's a fan website to Sea Monkeys, so that's perfect. But when I purchase a book with such a bright colorful cover and a bright colorful price tage I expect more."
5,Great Quality Replacement for Floyd Rose Trems!,"This was the only trem arm I could find that was constructed like the original arms on my REAL Floyd Rose trems. It fits perfect, tightens up as it should and feels great! I liked the first one so much, I bought more! A+"
1,biggie biten,"First off Little Kim is not a lyricst, she is a by product of the commercialistic entreprenuers who continually drag down the name and rep of one of the greatest lyricsts to ever live just to make puffy another dollar, let her freestlye one time she probably couldnt spit three verses, honestly, how many times can you say uhhhhg in one track. I say if you buy this your just incouraging more weak raps. but if you like it, it's all good, just show how much you know about hip-hop."
5,"Lil Kim Is the Queen, No doubt about it!!!!","Excxellent CD, she's the best Female MC out there hands down!!!! Brooklyn & the worlds finest!!! Do You Ma....."
2,Not As Good As When She Was Big Kim,"I must say, there are some ""bangin'"" rhymes on this disk. Nevertheless, I can't help yearning for the days of ""Big Kim."" Is it me, or was she just a little more agressive with her rhymes and such on her earlier efforts? Here's another thing. The lyrics here are just not that explicit, no matter what the labe suggests. Again, I find myself reflecting on the old Big Kim days, where even the ears of a hip ""Rough Rider"" such as myself would be ringing. Overall, I do bear the famous line in mind: ""Send not to ask for whom Lil' Kim raps, she raps for thee,"" and silly sentimentality leads me to award this two stars (instead of just one) as I remember Big Kim, and how all of us could be just Lil' some day. Plus - kickin' beats!"
4,Club D.J.inc,"Its worth it , tight,you can bang in the ride, at the house even at work (if you do) play this. but you have to like Lil Kim' style to the game. it's new and it' hardcore her flow is so hard.I'll give her 5 mics!!!!!!!!"
3,Iced Out,"Finally Lil Kim has released her long awaited sophomore album, Notorius KIM. The album has had a successful debut, but I'm not so sure that it's because of the quality of the album. I think that it's more becuase people have been waiting for so long to get the album, and becuase of all the hype around it. There are a few phat tracks,such as No Matter what People Say, the first single, but for the most part it's the same raunchy style, with a few new twists. The now platinum blonde rapper has a new producer on this album, Shaft, and said that she feels that she matured for this album, but that she is still the same Lil Kim."
1,THE NOTORIOUS F.L.O.P.,"It seems that Lil' Kim is sucessful with wearing skimpy outfitsand talking about oral sex,but pure artistry is not her by a longshot.This boring,uninspried romp shows that.The overdone ""NoMatter What They Say"",cheeseball ""Little Drummer Boy"" & ""RightNow"",and downright blah ""She Can't Love You"",the title track,and""How Many Licks"" make this an even more much-traveled road inslut-rap.And oh,yeah,Kim's ""attacks"" on Foxy Brown are wrong.BROKEN SILENCE is one of this year's best,while thisgarbage is one of the worst rap albums in years!"
4,Notorious versatility,"It wasn't what I expected, but she gets mad props for displaying all that talent and versatility on her album. She grew a lot as an emcee. Songs 1-4, 7-10,12,14-18 showcases all that. They are all different. Songs I didn't name you can skip because those are the only low points of the album - just 4 of 18 songs. Let's hope for her next album she won't (and doesn't need anyway) use wack a** Puff Daddy cause he had potential to ruin this album but it was a smart move for her to have talented producers up here (Rockwilder, Rated R) to prevent it. This is a must have so go get it."
5,THIS ALBUM IS HOT!,"Notorious K.I.M has got to be the #1 cd out today! I wanted to buy this cd because I like Lil'Kim's songs. She is a very strong female and this album has got great beats to show that, she is going to be here for a while in the rap business. I LOVE THE TITLE TOO! Anyway DO NOT hesitate to buy this album. I had never purchased any of her other albums and I LOVED this c.d.Lil'Kim puts quality into her rapping. I thought the beats, and lyrics were great! GO BUY THIS ALBUM IN STORES TODAY! You won't be dissapointed. YOU GO LIL' KIM! YOUR ALBUM SHOUTS PERFECTION!"
5,Still Ms.Queen Bee!!!,"For all you true rap heads out there,this is definetly the album to cop! As usual, Lil'Kim delivers lyrically. Most people hate on her because they can't feel where she's coming from. She gets into your mind and lyrically takes over. Overall, I give the album 8 stars out of 10. Mainly, because some of the beats and a few of her lyrics were not on point as much as I thought they would be. Some of my favorite cuts are Lil'Drummer Boy w/Ceelo& Redman,Track #4 is also blazin' because it gives some males out there a run for their money!, Single Black Female delivers spiritually, lyrically, and musically,Revolution blazes, Notorious K.I.M brashes some of her so-called industry enemies(good song),No Matter What They Say of course gets you on the dance floor!All tracks on side two bang except for Off The Wall, Right Now, and I'm Human. Overall this Cd is the bomb and Lil' Kim will always be QUEEN BEE!!!!!!!!!"
1,....,"Perhaps the WORST hip hop album so far this year. Not only is it a poor effort which is reminiscent of late 80's - early 90's rap, but the album is typical Kim, degrading to women, amusing to men. I don't think this album will go platinum, even with all of the Puff Daddy support it has. Many will probably find it pathetic that Lil Kim named her album after Biggy. Who can she even put herself in a class of B.I.G's talent? Who knows...but she knows she doesn't have any class, so she uses her breasts and provocative xxx rated lyrics to sell her music. No talent at all. This will probably be her last album, the party...and the Lexus, Infinitis, Benz, and lets not forget, Bentleys, will be gone soon as well. Her formula of T&A has grown old."
2,Notorious who...,For there to be so much hype about this album and then for the release date to get changed so many times I would have to say that the anticapation was for nothing. I gave it to stars just because I like one song on the cd that you can dance to. You don't dedicate garbage to someone you truly love and miss as she claims she does. Save your money and get something else like Eve. Her songs actually make sense imagine that.
2,They stain and don't clean easily.,"I use this with non-stick cookie sheets and they really are not necessary. I roasted some vegetables on it and it left a dark stain that I could not wash out. It is hard to clean because it tends to roll up. I roasted some nuts and they tended to stick to the surface when I tried to shake the pan to even out the nuts. I don't make cookies, so I don't know how the liner would react, but I think many spatulas would not slide easily due to the rubbery texture."
5,This is the best Medicine Woman CD,I only really like this original CD - the follow ups were a disappointment to me. I do highly recommend this CD though.Greg Young[...]
5,Five stars are not enough!,"""Medicine Woman"" -- Exotic, beautiful, joyous, uplifting, haunting music accompanied by Peruvian instruments. I bought this cd in a Goddess-spirituality shop a few years ago without having previously heard it. I was attracted by the stunning cover illustration of the Jaguar Shamaness. Well, the music is even more gorgeous than the illustration! Every track is wonderful. You can listen to it over and over. Here's ethnic music with an international appeal... my friends overseas have practically worn out the cassette I sent them. Strongly recommended!"
3,a cool dork,"This book is inturiging. It talks about a...becoming a better person. This book is for all ages. If you are a ..., this book is HIGHLY recomended. It gives you clues on how to become cool. So kids read it now!Aaron,Dustin"
4,Dork in Disguise,"Dork in Disguise is a good book for all kids. I picked this book because it's interesting it's about a boy that in his old school he was a dork. He moves to a different school , all summer he watch's music videos and reads magazines. There he likes a girl and he tries to impress her, her name is Cinnamon O'Brien. He has this other girl help him be cool. She's on the science team but he dosent want to join because he thinks cool kids don't join the science. Will he join? Will Cinnamon like him?If you pick up this book you won't want to put it down."
4,very informative,"Finding good information on the concepts of cryptography is never easy, but this book written with people like me in mind provided many of the starting blocks that my future crypto research required. I was very impressed with the amount of information supplied in this book, and also the way it was conveyed. Very useful."
1,If you like Rainer Maria DO NOT BUY,"I've been a fan of Rainer Maria's work for a long time. The raw power of kat and kyle is what makes this band amazing. Long Knives falls flat when put next any other Rainer Maria album, especially Look Now Again. If you are looking for cliche, for terrible lyricism, and for ridiculous over-production of mediocre songs, then by all means buy this album. The heart of Rainer Maria appears to have been lost. Put this album down, pick up a copy of the Pixies ""doolittle"" and you'll be alot happier."
4,"Great Hoop, Difficult Assembly","The hoop, backboard, rim, etc, all look very nice and once finally attached to the pole looks and plays great. But the assembly (especially the actual attachment to the pole) is very difficult. You'll need at least 2 people to put it together. Another problem was that a part or 2 were missing (bolt or nut), but after calling huffy sports they were sent right away."
5,Brilliant!,"For the fan of Muppetmania this show is by far the best of them all. If you stop to think about it. Dinosaurs could have been the inspiration of most shows in recent time. They eat live animals (Fear Factor). Annoying kids a jerk of a husband and a mother trying to teach morrals to her family (The Simpsons, Family Guy). Actually Dinosaurs is very intertaining even for the young viewers. Well balance acting and smart story lines. Also the special features such as the making of Dinosaurs is really interesting. See how many people it takes to make one character come to life. Even the smallest of creatures. A lot of work and special talent went into the making of Dinosaurs."
5,Fan of the TV Series....,"If you loved the series when it was on t.v., be rest assured that this will take you back to your favorite episodes, and its two seasons!"
4,"Great show, So-so DVDs","First off, I loved the show when I was a kid. It still hasn't gotten old either. The material is still great and it's about time it got put on DVD.The packaging is one of the worst jobs I've seen. You have an outside cover which splits right above ""DINOSAURS"" and doesn't really fit together that great. Then on the inside, you've got a basic DVD booklet. But the problem is there's 4 DVDs in one booklet, so you've got two on a side stacked on top of each other which makes it a pain if you want to watch disc 2 or disc 4 since you have to remove the other disc first.They didn't clean up the video either, although mind you it's still better than my 15 year old VHS copies. The audio is dolby digital stereo."
3,dinosaurs season 1 and 2,I found this series as funny as when I saw it many years ago with my daughter when she was little.
5,Dinosaurs - A Roaring Sensation for the 21st Century,"I remember watching this comedic tv series when I was a kid, back in the early 90's. My sister and I would stay at our aunt's house over the summer, and we couldn't wait until the Dinosaurs show came on on the Disney Channel.Father Earl and his family's hilarious, crack-up antics and idiotic schemes never failed to entertain my sister and I. The superb animatronics, unaging jokes and wise-cracking gags, and the ever entertaining, lovable Baby dinosaur had us choking with laughter.I recommend this dvd to any family with a sense of humor -- or any without, for that matter. The Complete First and Second Seasons of 'Dinosaurs' is sure to keep you and your family begging for more. But be warned: Even dinosaurs swore back then; so if you're eager to show this dvd to your little ones, it would be better to hold them back from seeing this show for a while."
4,small circular saw,Arrived on time and is a good saw for the every day handyman. Not for industrial work or everyday carpenter...
3,possible old stock,Been using this brand for years and this particular box does not print well. Suspect it is old stock and was not stored properly.
4,Ease of Construction and Works,"The pictures were vital to figuring out how to put the 900 pieces together. We still found a handful of parts left over. The motor worked just fine. All the parts moved, including the panels and the antennae. I would suggest that you put the solar panel decals on the plastic panels before you assemble the whole mast.Big issue: We cannot find out how to mount the station on the cardboard stand. We simply cannot get it to fit and there is no instruction or diagram that shows how."
3,Not for use with smokers,"If you've got no other cooks illustrated books and want to know only about grilling, this isn't a bad purchase. If you have the New Best recipes, save your money as there is too much overlap. And if you don't have either, I'd recommend getting the new Best recipes as it covers many more topics. This book is geared to grilling, or how to use your grill as a poor substitution for a smoker."
5,My desert island grilling book,"Yes, if I had to choose just one grilling cook book, it would be this one--not just for the exhaustively clear and detailed instructions for barbecuing a comprehensive range of foods, but for the outstanding sauce, rub, glaze and marinade recipes. It's all carefully tested and presented for both charcoal and gas grillers.There are even some ""ultimate"" recipes in here; the one for charcoal grilled maple glazed salmon comes to mind.I upgraded to this new edition when it was first published, and it was well worth it for key additions like that grilled salmon.For its sheer competent scope, this book has no true rival of which I am aware. It deserves a place in the core cookbook collection of the serious griller, from beginner to expert."
5,Best Grilling & Barbecue Book Around,"I got this book for my husband for his birthday and boy did I hit the mark! My husband doesn't read for pleasure but he, no pun intended, ate this book up. He refers to it constantly and everything he has tried from the book has been wonderful. He says that it is full of the reason why a technique is used and he has learned much from it. I then bought it for my twenty-something son and he says the same thing!! It was a good investment for both my culinary tastes and to get my husband to read something!! The food is great and I don't get chenobyl chicken anymore!!! Really worth the read. Period."
4,The one we've been waiting for...,"Since SQL Server 7 went ""gold"" a few months ago, DBA's (and other admin's) have been waiting for a solid guide to SQL Server 7 administration. This book certainly fills the void."
5,Excellent,I am a regular (no pun intended) user of this product and it works. Much lower cost than the Surfak I used to purchase.
3,Pond Balance,"I have used this product for years and was looking to replace by blue bucket of Pond Balance. What I got, was a small box of the product, also pictured, rather than the larger container. The wording of the SIZE of the product either eluded me or wasn't clearly mentioned. I was disappointed at receiving a small box of product, rather than the larger bucket. Check carefully what you are getting -- buyer beware."
5,Soundtrack for Firelight,"Firelight is one of my all-time favorites.I am very excited that it is now on dvd, but I wonder if there are any special features. I got the cd of the soundtrack for my birthday two years ago- The composer is Christopher Gunning. It took some internet investigating in order to find it, but it is well worth it. The music is haunting and poignant. It is nice to see some others appreciate this wonderful film and its beautiful music."
3,Basic jig saw but its GOOD,The Skil jig saw is basic. The rotation for the foot is ONLY 45 degrees. So don't expect any different angle cuts using the foot. But the saw works well and is useful for a occasional home fixes. I wouldn't use it if I was a professional who needs more options in a saw.
2,Underpowered,"As in some of my other tool reviews, spend a little more and get a proper jig saw.I am usually a fan of Skil products, especially when I buy at a reduced price throughCPO Outlets as refurbs.(great company), but I got what I paid for. This saw is for1/2"" plywood or 3/4"" pine at best even with new Bosch blades."
5,Does the job.,"Quick and easy connection of eReaders, flash drives, and digital cameras to my iMac. Works great. Good price, low profile and easy to use."
2,Poor Try,"This movie is poor in just about every area. Some of the character/animal art design is nice, but that is about it. The story and characters are bland and cliche. The animation is awful."
1,The Bigggest Bomb of all time comes to DVD!?,"I never thought they would have the guts to put this on DVD. The film lasted 6 days in the theater and is the worst grossing film of all time to open on 2000 screens or more. Could be one awesome commentary to hear how it all went so, so wrong. I actually saw the film the day it came out, along with a few hundred others in the world so I feel ""special"" to say that since it will be rare for anyone in history to say they actually saw this weak film opening day."
3,Cutie Pie,"D anthony is cute, but this cd is probably only good for younger girls, I really only liked the song ""Cutie Pie"""
3,I walked with a zombie,"This is the third tales from the crypt big screen movie, not quite as good as Demon Knight or the Bordello of Blood, both available in one from Amazon.Tales From The Crypt (Bordello of Blood / Tales From The Crypt: Demon Knight). I think the main problem I had is that this Movie was a Bad rehash of I walked with a Zombie. Jennifer Gray was not convincing nor were any of the other actors, this would have been okay as a TV special at halloween but not as a big budget Movie. Only purchase this if you are a big fan of tales from the crypt"
4,Two-Sided DVD?,"We lost our video of Rock-A-Doodle and needed to replace it -- was so relieved to find this (great price, too!) However, it was a bit frustrating when we put it in to play. My grandson sat patiently through Pebble & The Penguin, thinking that Rock-A-Doodle would play after it -- it didn't! He was so disappointed. We took out the DVD to look at it and after finding a magnifying glass, we were able to read the title on the reverse side of the DVD, and sure enough, we played the other side and there was Rock-A-Doodle. I never knew a CD or DVD to have content on both sides (although when you think about it, it makes sense especially with 2-disc sets, etc!) All was wonderful after that."
3,Good questions marred by quality control problems,"Attention Rampart Books: Please hire an editor!!The questions were very helpful - not as finicky as the SCJP questions, but useful at determining a person's level of Java understanding. However, the answers contained a number of inaccuracies and errors. Example: p. 142, wrong signature for toString() is given; p. 143, ""In this example, 22=4..."" should be ""Since 2 (superscript) 2 = 4..."".I would have given it four or even five stars had these problems not existed."
1,Terrible book,"There is something fishy about this book. Some of the answers given for proposed interview questions are just plain wrong. The description of the author says he has some kind of Java developer certification but it doesn't use the right terminology for the Sun Certified Java Developer(SCJD). If he had the SCJD then he would also have the Sun Certified Java Programmer certification but they don't mention that one. Hey author, what's your SCJD certification number so we can look it up?At one point the author cautions against hiring anyone 60 years or older because if the company provides full retirement benefits at 70, the company would only get 10 years work before paying for a full pension. Is that blatantly discriminatory or what? No wonder it's tough to get a decent job if you're over 50!"
2,"Bought two -- one was fine, one didn't work at all","I bought two of these at the last minute for a long trip I was going on. One worked just fine and the other couldn't hold a charge at all. Buyer beware -- if you do want to try this, I would suggest testing them out before the 30 day return window."
5,One of the Very Best,"""I Really Wanna Know You"", was a big hit off of this album. ""The Light of Smiles"", is still my all-time favorite, though. This album, is in ""The Right Place"", as well....."
4,Nice Rack,"As advertised, took a couple of weeks to get it. But that was the deal. Overall very happy with the rack. Wife is happy, house does not smell like nasty hockey bag. throwing dryer sheets in my bag also helped."
1,Join the Pyramid Scheme,"Dr. Neil Solomon not only lost his license, but is also under an agreement to never practice medicine or give medical advice, so now he pushes quack cures like Noni Juice which is distributed via the internet and through multi-level marketing.Noni juice companies use this so-called ""guide"" in order to promote their useless products and Solomon is actually the official physician of the ""International Noni Communicatiion Council"" and is hardly an impartial scientist.Looking for sound medical advice in this waste of paper is like asking the meat marketing board for a vegetarian recipe."
4,Another Good Book From Forta,"I've read about a third of the book, and once again I'm pleased with Forta's work. This is an ideal book for beginners, but much of the material is too rudimentary for experienced ColdFusion programmers. I probably would have bought the O'Reilly (that's what I chose for my CF5 book), but it's not available yet. I'm a little bummed out that I have to buy another book (the Forta Advanced) to get the whole picture on MX."
3,"Eh, so so.","This book is full of information. Unfortunatly you can't find any of it quickly. The index is shabby, the layout of the book is designed to read easy but it lacks as a reference utility. Personally I like the oreilly style. Give the tech details, give an example go on. Forta's style is give a glimpse at whats going on, give an example. Give a little bit more of glimpse, give an example. It's quite frustrating for speed learners. I give this book 3 stars, if you have time to sift through endless bs then pick it up. If you're looking for a good book to learn cold fusion fast than go else where."
2,Lagging behind each time more,"Ben Forta was the reference in the good old days. But then he started to have the same book contents under different titles (as some smart reviewers here also noticed), to enlist several different people to co-author his books and to be away from software development itself. Not surprisingly he has now many books published. Unfortunately quantity and quality do not come often together.His books are no longer the reference. Many better ones are available now. Smart readers will see that Ben Forta has somehow hit a wall. This one book is a particular example of a book that will keep readers far away from the powerful and much faster roads to productive and excellent CF development that some other books just simply have. Beginners readers may take longer to realize that. Until after they discover how much time and money they have lost."
4,Still looking for a certain song I think by Ann Murray...,"This is a great c.d. but I'm still looking for a certain song that I think Ann Murray sang. If anybody can help me it would be of great apprieciation. I can only give you a line or two in the song here and there but if you can make it out. Here it goes: ""I feel it in my fingers, I feel it in my toes"" ""Just let the feeling show"" ""I'm gonna love ya, I always will"" The voice sounds like Ann Murray but I can't find it on any of her c.d.'s by just the samples you give, so if someone can help...Thanks."
4,yet another postive review,I already had so I was already predisposed to getting a Canon Digital camera. I love my Elan but it's the digital age!The Digital Rebel works with all my Canon lenses without a problem. It took a little time getting different to the behavior due to the size of the sensor versus the film but not too long.The unit is well made and has stood up he test of time.Color response is accurate enough for me. It's clearly not film but I can live with it.
5,WOW Camera,"This Camera is excellent one!! really when you compare its price and its results and the level of quality you get you will know why this is the best in its category, I'm getting a very professional results using it with a lot of styles.. Highly recommended"
1,Maybe I got a lemon,Maybe I got a lemon. I bought this camera based on the previous reviews. I was so dissapointed with the very first shots I took. I was expecting sharp clear pictures and all I got were slightly fuzzy ones. This camera was supposed to be an upgrade from my Kodak 740 5mp. My Kodak takes amazing pictures! You can see every hair and every eyelash on my grandsons with the Kodak 740 and I was expecting to be blown away by the picture quality of the Canon by moving up from a 5mp to an 8mp. I tried different settings manual and auto but my old Kodak 740 takes much better pictures. I'm sending this back to Amazon and upgrading to the Kodak 8.2mp Easyshare. Hopefully the new Easyshare will fix the complaints I had with the 740 - the lag time between pictures and with image stabilization I can't wait to see what kind of pictures I can get with it.
1,Main dial never worked?,"I bought this product a little over a year ago but did not get to the creative functions until recently. When I tried to use the main dial it did not work. The camera has been meticulously cared for and has never been dropped, bumped, etc. Canon charged me $200 to fix (I was 8 days outside their warranty but they wouldn't budge). $200 to fix a piece of plastic on a $600 camera...The camera takes nice pictures but should be fairly expensive to operate at $200 per year...Last Canon product I'll ever buy."
2,Truly and honestly....Not Worth IT!!,"Only if you are a point and shoot photographer who is making a jump from the crappy ""put em in your pocket"" no control for the photographer type of camera to this will you be happy with this camera and then only if you keep using the automatic function. If you have used any of the upper class point and shoots (e.g. Panasonic's FZ line) don't buy this camera. This thing only qualifies as an SLR, in my opinion, because you can put different lenses on it. Otherwise it is no better, if not worse, than most of the high end point and shoots these days."
5,"Awesome camera, right price....happy camper.",I bought this camera and love it. This camera takes great pictures and the fact that it works with the EOS accessories is a huge plus. I can use the other lens that I have without having to buy new gear.Its not too heavy and fits well in the hands. I also purchased a 4GB card and have extra storage space.I am very happy with the camera and highly recommend it.
5,Money WELL spent,"I have to say that as a fledgling photographer i was very unsure of what camera to buy, but after reading a lot of reviews and talking to a lot of pros i was directed to the Canon Rebel as a phenominal camer ato start with. Easy to use, simplistic design, sturdy, reliable, and still produces professional quality pictures. I must admit that the options and settings that are available are a bit much for me but the cameras auto selection takes excellent pics until you figure it all out.I HIGHLY recommend this camera to anyone that is looking to get started in photography."
4,Put You There,"As a child, my visiting home was a small town in Georgia where we had those Saturday nite gatherings. So the book for me was very vivid and fast paced. Mr. Black, had me crying at times as well as laughing aloud with his explanation of events."
3,Good Book - However,"This was a pretty good book....with several twists and turns. However, I was not a big fan of the constant day dreaming by the author. It appeared to be a filler for the book. I am a Daniel Black fan so this book will not deter me from others"
2,this isn't working . . .,"I've had my dog on this for 2 months now. I doubled the dose for the first 30 days and am now on a single dose but see no improvement. The vet did say he has arthritis back there and recommended this product. He limps on the one leg when he gets up mostly and some other times I see him limping as well. It hasn't changed since before the pills. I estimate I have enough pills to last him for 2 more months and if still no improvement, I'm stopping the pills and stopping wasting my money.Only pluses to this is he eats them happily as if they're treats. The smell is really not horrible, it could be improved but does any dog food product really smell ""good""?"
5,Better Than Any Other Joint Helper Chewables for Dogs,"My parents Brittany Spaniel was on these the last few years of her life. She lived to be 19, and was walking around much better on these than she had been on the previous pills. And she loved the taste."
5,Here are the directions to your organizations mind & heart.,"What is it about organizations that creates so many secrets? In this bright and enjoyably written book, Annette Simmons reveals the subtle art of allowing people to share the secrets througth dialogue. From identifying the escape routes to explaining the step by step process in which dialogue unfolds she clearly identifies what you can expect if you simply follow the directions. She even includes directions. I immediately used this book in a two day retreat that was astounding in helping a California State Agency work through the change process."
4,Jims review,"This is an excellent ""how to"" book, that deals with a nebulous subject, dialogue.It not only endorses and explains the need for dialogue, but goes way beyond helping middle management and leadership understand the important steps that must be taken if an organization is going to really attempt to change the culture and create a new atmosphere in which dialogue just might happen!enjoy!"
3,It didn't work for me.,"As soon as this Rollator was unpacked I saw that it was too big for my use. It is a beautiful, well made item but one must consider their size when ordering. My mistake but trust the company will accept the return and credit my account."
2,"Walkabout 8"" Review","For the low price I guess its OK. Like...very little too like. Unacceptable...too heavy; brake cables far, far too long; seat base material is just cheap chip board. This cuased a lifting handle I had added to pull out, and I subsequently cut my arm."
5,Small Change: The Secret Life of Penny Burford,"The book itself was in excellent condition. Small Change is a good story, well-told. It was very engaging, quickly-read, and besides that it made good point."
5,Fresh as the day it was recorded,"This has always been my favorite Burton album. It's also my favorite of the Burton/Coryell albums. It proves that happy sounding music can still be serious music, without the pondering.One Amazon complaint: Why is Pat Metheny listed next to Burton's on the heading?Dennis Watts"
1,Not what I expected,I line Foreign Exchange but some of the language is strong I love the instumental cd it is a work of art
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Sutcliff here tells the story of the young Arthur Pendragon, and how hecomes to be king of Britain, in the manner of the Sword in the Stone.The structure of this book is slightly different, as far as eachchapter focusing on one particular character of Arthur's circle."
2,The Sword and The Circle,"Going back to King Arthur's court and others, you read stories about Arthur, Merlin, the Knights of the Round Table, etc. You read about the battles they fought kingdoms they originated from, quests they took on, and their true love.If you like books about King Arthur, the Knights of the Round Table, and others, then Rosemary Sutcliffs, The Sword and the Circle, would be a good choice. I my opinion, it was an okay book, though I am not into knights and kings, etc."
2,Why do we need this?,"I'm sorry. Nothing personal against Ms. Brown, but enough is enough. You have your fairy paintings plastered over every conceivable surface from greeting cards to air fresheners. Did you really need to venture into the Tarot/Oracle market? You already have ""collectible"" cards in circulation.All the art in this deck has been in circulation before now. It is an obvious ploy to cash in on another market. This does nothing but bring down the reputation of the genre and where people are creating decks from scratch specifically for tarot/oracle purposes.If you are a fan of Ms. Brown's art then I guess there could be worse ways to spend your money. I have to give her credit for being able to market herself so well. But if you are looking for a true tarot or oracle deck, then I suggest you look elsewhere. I'm frankly astonished at the high sales rankings I see here."
2,disappointed...,I was anticipating Nina Gordon's solo debut much more than the new Veruca. Turns out that Resolver my be the best album of the year and Tonight needs work.
2,"great singer, bad songs","although I do have to give credit to Nina's attractive and flexible (very) voice and some of her song-writing skills, it is a pity that this whole album sounds like a string of songs with similar tunes (With the exception of ""Badway""). These songs are too soft and lacking either the upbeat rhymes of dance pop or the original rock styles that Veruca Salt has been associate with. The record is not going anywhere because it's too plain, and has no particular style."
2,Boy things have changed since Varuca Salt!,"Wow. I wanted to get more of what I liked about Nina'sprevious gig, Varuca Salt. If I'd realized that the over-played(!!!) and hyper annoying title track was one that I actuallyrecognized, I would have thought twice. ""Badway"" is probably thehighlight of this CD for fans of VS. If you like the slickharmonies, of course you'll like ""Number One Camera"", but ifthat's the case, get one of the import versions of this CD whichalso contain ""Black and Blonde"". Other ""slick"" tunes include ""NewYear's Eve"" and ""Now I Can Die""."
1,Well... It's Nina Gordon...,"Leave it to Bob Rock to take a rocker and turn them into a stinking pile. Needless to say he did wonders for Metallica. If they were aiming to produce garbage they succeeded. I personally wonder what they were thinking too. Anyway Nina Gordon would have been better suited doing something heavier, and not so glitzy. Between her syrupy sweet songs and Bob Rocks overly glossy production they managed to collaberate and produce crap. Thanks guys."
5,An Excellent Album!,"I heard the title track of this album, ""Tonight and the Rest of My Life"" on the radio and liked it so much that I sat in my car in the parking lot at the supermarket until the song ended. I enjoy songs that have meaning, if not to me at least to the artist. The thirteen tracks of this album are all meaningful, creative and thoughtful. It's certainly evident that Nina Gordon enjoys and is serious about her profession.The airwaves seem to be full of meaningless pop songs that aren't any fun for someone like me to listen to. Hearing Nina Gordon was a refreshing change. Check out this album if you enjoy listening to something different and entertaining. I also recommend, Neil Young, Tom Petty, Fleetwood Mac, Eurythmics and Bruce Springsteen."
3,Slender Charms,"For her first solo after leaving Veruca Salt, Nina Gordon trades the catchy alternapunk of her former band for the agreeable pop rock of Tonight and the Rest of My Life. Songs this slick are reliant on radio, where their bright resourcefulness would be best appreciated. With the recent success of Vitamin C and the Cardigans, the possibility exists for these hooky nuggets to embed themselves in the public consciousness. Gordon has a perennial in ""New Year's Eve"" (much like Vitamin C's ""Graduation (Friends Forever)""), some great ballads, choice rockers. Many of these tunes would make fitting background music for WB or Fox teen dramas (a few already are). Slight, for certain, yet not without its slender charms."
1,the girl thinks she could punk rock....,"You've heard her voice on ""Tonight and the Rest of My Life"" would you think she would have the potential to rock? I wouldn't think so and after I heard her others songs I was like.. oh crap I wasted 12.99 +tax. I was hoping it would have been the same case when I bought Dido ""No Angel"" only for the song ""Here With Me"" then listen to the whole thing and LOVE every song. If you really want talent check out Dido's ""No Angel"" not some half arse artist"
3,"Perfect pop, yet...","These songs are perfectly structured pop songs, but the bottom line, in my humble opinion, is the spirit the artist puts into a song. No where on this album is there a song that expresses half of the spirit and emotion typical of old Veruca Salt songs. Nina Gordon doesn't even seem to care about these songs herself, so why should we?"
4,Sing-along heaven,"Gordon sounds like she's channelling Karen Carpenter on several of the songs on this album, including the title song, which sounds like a long-lost Carpenters song. To make the references more explicit, Gordon chooses to cover a Carpenters song, ""The End Of The World"", for her album closer. Ironically, she sounds less like Karen on this number than on others, and this song is probably the weakest spot on the album. There are only a couple of numbers (""Badway"", ""Number One Camera"") that will remind people of her old band, Veruca Salt. Mostly, this is a collection of tunes so catchy, and sung so sweetly, that you may ignore the trite lyrics to sing along."
5,Completely Underrated,"I don't know why this album never took off like it should. I remember hearing the first single on the radio for a minute. This is a super catchy super polished album. Gotta love the pictures on the cd too.Interestingly, I also love the Veruca Salt album that came out sans Nina Gordon about this time as well. It's much angrier than this album and not as polished but has just as many catchy songs.Right now imo Nina and Louise are making better albums without each other than they were with each other. I just wish that we did not have to wait so long between albums to hear new material."
4,pepper shakers,the shakers are cute and will be a well accepted addition to their kitchen.were on time and packed well.no breakage
3,Not exactly impressed.,"The fabric is a little itchy. It is quite pricy, you could buy a pillow with the same amount of money."
4,It's okay...a little stiff,"The fabric isn't very soft, but it definitely does it's job of protected my body pillow. And it's not a really big deal if you use a cover over the protector."
3,Decent,"A decent body pillow cover. It's a lower thread count so not Westin ""heavenly bed"" quality but does the job just fine."
4,Okay. Wish it was a little longer and no zipper.,"I bought two of these, one for each of the two body pillows in my home. The price is right, the fabric is soft enough, and they launder fine. I'd rather they were a few inches longer and no zipper, but oh well."
5,EXCELLENT REFERENCE WORK ON PRINTMAKING,"AN EXCITING AND COLORFUL BOOK WITH SUPERB EXPLAINATIONS AND ILLUSTRATIONS OF THE MANY TYPES OF PRINTMAKING TECHNIQUES. I FOUND IT MOST ENLIGHTINING AS A NOVICE TO THIS AREA OF ART. IT NOT ONLY TEACHES THE MANY FORMS OF PRINTMAKING, BUT IT IS AN EXCELLENT GUIDE TO THE ACCEPTANCE OF WORKS UNDER THE TITLE OF ""PRINTS"" WHEN FACED WITH A JURORED EXHIBITION. ONLY POSSIBLE WEAKNESS I FOUND WAS A LACK OF A GLOSSARY OF TERMS SUCH AS""CHINE COLLE"",BUT I WOULD RECOMMEND IT HIGHLY TO ANYONE INTERESTED IN ENTERING THE FIELD OF PRINTMAKING."
2,Can't ignore irritating vocals,"Don't get me wrong, the music on this CD is OK. But the singer's voice is this irritating, constantly whining monotone that drives me insane. If you hear one song, you'll think it's a gimmick to give it originality. However, he sings like that in every song, to the point of becoming annoying. Another downside is that if you listen closely, the songs are all basically the same... 3 or 4 are actually based on nearly identical riffs. Kinda disappointing for an otherwise original band. If you can look past these things, give it a shot..."
1,you like it? really?,"There are tens of bands churning out songs in a similar vein to this. Every potentially interesting intro is interrupted by a scream from the lead whinger, as they don't have the talent to build an atmosphere. Overproduced (isn't all nu-metal?) and even then there isn't enough style to make up for the lack of substance. Unoriginal, thoughtless, utter pap. This album should not just be put to one side, but hurled away with great force. At least you can practise discus with it!"
2,(shudder),"well, this cd was kind of a disappointment. wait...scratch ""kind of"" eplace that with ""massive overhaul"". This is so much worse than welcome. it's not surprising the group threw this album together in about 5 months. the vocals are sloppy, the guitar isn't nearly up to par, and all the ongs sound the same: whiny and obnoxious. a couple songs are tolerable, but i'd spring for welcome before considering this."
1,"Crap, Crap, Crap, how else do u explain it!!","If this is not the most boring hard rock album of all time i do not know what is. [...] all the songs sound the same. I bought this as i heard the single ""Again and Again"". I thought this song was i fairly good track with ptential even though his voice sounded so manufactured. I put this on and heard 12 songs of all which sounded the same. Not only was the whole album ordinary, but his voice was disgraceful, it is all manufactured [....] DO NOT BUY THIS CD, YOU CAN THANK ME LATER!!!"
1,Hated it!,"I bought ""Welcome"" and ""Blue Sky"" and love them both, I saw the reviews for ""Gift"" and thought how can I go wrong, wow didI go wrong. I don't think I have ever bought an albumn and not like one song on it, but here it is. If you bought this albumn and was less than thrilled with it, try Welcome or Blue Sky before you give up on Taproot."
4,Definetely a buy for heavier listeners!,"I am a big fan of all music, but primarily heavier rock. I like Limp Bizkit, Korn, System of a Down, Spineshank, Slipknot, and mellower stuff like Incubus and 311. Taproot sound a lot like 311 meets Deftones... They have the heavy music style of Deftones, but the singer (Steve) has great vocals, so he sings and screams...I bought this CD today and cannot stop listening to it. Again and Again and Mirror's Reflection are my two favorite songs as of right now.By the way this is also the band that started the big controversy between Limp Bizkit and System of A Down on the Family Values Tour issue when Limp kicked SOAD off..IT was because Taproot signed with SOAD's label and not Fred's.. Anyways, I highly recommend the CD. They are a great new band and will only get bigger.Enjoy"
4,Taproot,"Hmm... Taproot is a good band, but they definetly could be better... Let's face it, they DONT sound like neither Korn, or Limp Bizkit, except for #4, it sounded a little bit like old Korn. The rest of the album is pretty much a new style. Heavy guitars, lots of screams, just a plain old Heavy Rap/Rock album. Nothing new, but still worth a shot. Check it out."
4,Great!,I bought this and it was just what I wanted. It was great and I've listened to it several times since purchase.
2,just did not help,I would not recommend this patch to anyone. It did not help in the least. I am still trying to lose weight
3,Old vs New,"I would have liked to see more photos of Playland and thenearby buildings. That said, it is a good book. The oldCliff House is much more attractive than the remodeled onethere now. More photos of the Baths would also have been nice."
2,Changing of the guard,What a fantastic match. It show an emerging Roger Federer and even though Pete is 29 - you can see why he has so great at Wimbledon. These are both players I truly admire and this match show cases both their talents.
3,Mostly satisfied,"It was a challenge to find this product and when I did find it on Amazon I was thrilled. It has been perfect for my infant who has used it while learning how to sit up. I know that if he topples over, he will not bump his head on the floor. It is very lightweight. My preschooler can easily move it between rooms for me so that the baby can sit with us while we're doing different activities. The only problem that I have with it is that one of the seams came apart the first day that my baby used it. I'm pretty sure it can be fixed, but I would've expected it to be more durable. Other than that problem, I have been very satisfied with it."
2,Bright and fun but BEWARE!,"This can be a suffocation hazard toy, it is a plastic inflatable toy, do not use unsupervised. Our boy is still small but he sits up on his own but he slumped down where he was on his side inside of the ring, he managed to get his body stuck on his side down inside of the ring, so he could not stretch or roll out of it. He was stuck, ( in a 1/2 circle shape) thank god I was there when it happened. So Not recommended for smaller babies in size.On THE POSITIVE, HE LOVES IT! LOVES COMFY FEELING OF IT THE GREAT COLORS AND TEXTURES! That is why I gave it 2 stars"
4,Great Product,"I bought this for my son when he was just a few months old. He loved it. It has a lot of different textures along the sides to keep him occupied. The only ""negative"" is that it can only be used for a few short months before your child outgrows it."
3,Not what I expected.,Not what I expected. It is simply a list of birds. No illustrations. Very boring. I wish there were more explanation in the description on- line
4,flawless great sword of coldfire,this game is ok overall hack and slash just to tell you youl get bored after awile when you are done beating extreme thou i think the games a little bit of a warm up to rpg once you get into rpg's then i think youre ready for the game of diablo 2 LOD i think i have said enuf for you to consider rpg's(-_-) Peace out
3,Awesome cooperative game,"This is an ok game. The co-op mode is great but only for two people. Its a great alternative to guantlet legends but still only for two players. The game is also really dark and so are the charactes so you have a hard time seeing them. The thing i dislike the most is the lack of classes and character customization and specialization the the other games had. But overall, the gameplay is fun and sometimes challenging."
3,It was good but not THAT good,"I have read quite a few SEP books and this one was recommended to me as being one of her best and most 'angst' ridden. I found it just a little TOO 1980s for my liking. I was looking for a romance and it focused too much on loads of other things and not enough on the romance between the H & H. There was lots about her mother, the mother's youth and background and relationship with her real father, about the mother's relationship with the step-father, about the half brother, about her 'finding' herself in her career and (for me) not enough about the romance. That's fine if that is the kind of thing you are looking for but I wasn't. It reminded me a bit of the real mega 1980's blockbusters by Judith Kranz - remember 'Scruples'?? Nevertheless it is well written, entertaining and the romance parts were lovely. Just not enough of them."
1,Can't recommend it,"I read all of Susan's books (some couple of times) except the last one published, till I discovered Francine Rivers' books that changed my life for eternity. Oh Susan, I wish you would read Francine River's books too and understand what I am trying to say and become a new type of writer. Then I would read your books again."
2,"I love Susan Elizabeth Phillips, but this felt like Jackie Collins","I own every Susan Elizabeth Phillips romance, and this is the very first time I felt let down. She is such a wonderful, funny, sweet story teller who knows how to steam things up (my husband thanks her!) But this book felt more like a Jackie Collins. That is not bad necessarily, but it felt tougher. I had a hard time relating to the Character Belinda at all, and the Alexi/Fluer plot is just painful not fun or intriguing. I am sure others will find it a gem, I just did not feel her in this book."
4,wonderful,what a wonderful book! the charters a well developed and complex in there own way and best of all know ones perfect. This one isn't as good as honey moon but it is close with the times in the 50's through the 80's it gets a little crazy! whatever you do SEP fans before you buy it see if the library has it! if you love it than buy it but check the library first and save thirty bucks.
1,"Not funny, not sexy","I, like other readers, love SEP books, this felt like another author. I can read US weekly if I want hollywood, give me funny, give me what SEP used to have, heart! Belinda was a difficult character to feel anything for and Jake was very archetypal, just blah for me and it bummed me out!"
1,Too hard,"It's too hard. I am 6' 190lbs, and it's like hitting a brick wall through a 2"" exercise mat."
3,Once excellent series goes average,"Why is everyone giving this book such high marks? SQL 7.0 unleashed is a decent reference which covers the basics but not much else.The SQL unleashed series took a step back. I'm very disappointed that this incredible reference has now become simply average. Don't get rid of your SQL 6.5 unleashed...you'll still need it! The 6.5 edition was a masterful tome which included all kinds of wondeful info that couldn't be found anywhere else. The 7.0 book is sparse on the very details that made the 6.5 version so endearing.By the way...David Soloman is not an author on this book (as listed above). In fact this is an entirely different team of writers than were on 6.5. Two of the heros of 6.5 edition, Spenik and Sledge are the authors of the top SQL book on my desk: SQL 7.0 DBA Survival Guide."
5,Excellent Book,"My position as a SQL Server DBA for a large company with different platforms, requires me to do lots for research. I found this book very helpful in getting the answers I need for my job. Especially in the area of converting to SQL server 7"
2,"good plate, cheap stick","This is the second spinning plate that I have recently purchased and I could not remember the name of the first company. The plate is fine, a hard plastic. The stick is cheap and flimsy. I compare it to my previous purchase which also had a jointed stick, but the other was a better joint and a firmer plastic. This stick makes spinning a little trickier and for someone just learning... good luck."
4,Plastic Spinning Plate,I bought this plastic spinning plate for my eleven year old granddaughter who told me that she would like to have one. It arrived in good time and in perfect shape. What we both didn't realize was that it takes some extra special skill to make the plate spin.
5,EVERY JOURNALIST NEEDS TO READ THIS BOOK!!!,"Dr. Ann Utterback has done it again with her latest book ""Broadcasting Through Crisis""....it is a must-have for anyone in the news business. Being a journalist is one of the most stressful jobs out there...this book shows you how to stay focused on your job while dealing with the tragedy at hand. She has guidelines for coping with stress. The useful tips will change your on-air performance and you can apply them to your everyday life at home. Reading the stories from the reporters in the trenches will make you realize how important it is to manage your stress so you can stay healthy, happy and be at the top of your game."
4,This book helped me lose weight.,"I bought this book when I started losing weight early last year. Its combination of facts and hints reenforced what I was doing. Mr. Fumento backs up his assertions with ample documentation from the medical literature and quotes from experts in the field. I know Mr. Fumento is a controversial figure but I suspect it's only because he's so adept at debunking the precious myths of the ""fat acceptance"" movement. You won't like everything you read in this book but if you're serious about losing weight (and keeping it off) you'll read it and take its messages to heart. I've lost 30 pounds and got back down to my ideal body weight (per the 1959 Metropolitan Life chart) for the first time in fifteen years. I continue to refer to the book for hints on maintaining my current weight."
1,WRONG TYPE OF GAME,PERFECT GAME AND PERFECT EVERYTHING ELSE BUT I NEEDED IT FOR MY HOME COMP AND IT WAS WRONG BUT IT ALL WAS FIXED PERFECT.
5,An Engineer's Cookbook,"I highly recommend this cookbook. As an engineer who will be retiring in a few months, I've decided to spend some of my free time re-learning how to cook. America's Test Kitchen has a great PBS TV show in my area, and from the show I learned of their cookbook. Like the show, their cookbook uses recipes that have been tested multiple times to get them right. They use common ingredients, and provide explanations as to why the recipes are formulated the way they are. I remember in the past using cookbooks with ""take-it-or-leave-it"" recipes with no mention of how they were derived. I appreciate America's Test Kitchen's explanations and valuable tips. I've tried about 10 recipes so far and each has turned out great - even with having to cut down the recipes to smaller sizes or freezing the leftovers. I no longer rely on frozen TV dinners."
2,Not very impressed.,"A better title for this cookbook would have been ""Everyday Recipes with a Few Strange Ingredients Added to Make Them Seem Exotic."" Most of the recipes contained in this book don't sound very appetizing at all, and a lot of them have ingredients that I've never actually seen in any Asian dishes, from any country. So I'm donating it and sticking with my other Asian cookbooks for now."
1,Don't be fooled - this is not good for you,"Firstly, this is not condensed soup, and it is this and lacking in consistency. Secondly, they tripled the amount of sugar per serving. Tastes disgusting.Will never buy again, do not recommend."
3,Examples,I hate when books give me a bunch of theories and never give me examples of leaders that use these types of leadership styles. That could of been added. The case studies were interesting.
2,BEWARE--YOU WILL NOT GET 14 GAMES FOR THE GBA!,"The 14 games that are advertised do not exist on the GBA edition--only five! Apparently, 14 games are available for other platforms, and hence the confusion. Also, if you already own the Namco Museum for for the GBA, you will only get two new games (Rally-X and Pac-Man). Both the Museum and Museum 50th Anniversary versions include Ms. Pac-Man, DigDug and Galaga. The Namco Museum includes Pole Position which is not in the 50th Anniversary Edition. In my opinion, many of the games in the Namco Museum seem to play better, but the 50th Anniversary Edition permits you to rotate the games sideways (not sure it helps much).In short, it's three or four star buy if you don't have the Namco Museum and a one or two star buy if you you already have it."
2,Poorly written fluff,"I did not know anything about the author or former book. I picked out this book expecting a light and humorous read, which it is. But I also expected something written above a third grade reading level, which it is not. I guess I am not the targeted audience. So if you are a ten year old girl, or you have the mentality of a ten year old, you may enjoy this book."
5,If You Can't Stand the Heat.....,"This book is absolutely mind-blowing.I was not familiar with Ms Peters' work previously and after seeing this book was inspired to take a look at her earlier books. It was interesting to see how she has developed since ""Colette's Cakes"" -- her imaginative designs, her sense of color, her sense of whimsy -- even her writing, has grown with her talent.This is, however, 'A Master Class in Decorating' as the title indicates. Although I think an attentive beginner could readily follow her instructions, as with anything, innate talent and experience will play a large part in the end result.I imagine there will be those who will look at this book and think it is far too elaborate for the average person capabilties.Well, if one never aspires to greater heights, one will always be.......average.This is a book for inspiration.Bravo!"
2,"Amazingly accomplished, awfully tacky","To be fair, I am not the target audience for this book, ie. a cake pro. I am an experienced home cake baker and avid reader of cookbooks on baking and decorating.I give this book a two star rating for originality and lots of pictures. Unfortunately, to me the visual style of these cakes is just off-putting in its (very American) garishness. They do not look like something one would wish to eat, in fact to me they are mostly amazing, can't-believe-this-is-a-cake eyesores. I'm sure they do impress a lot of people though which would make them ideal for corporate events, tacky weddings and such.This is not a fair review to be sure - I'm sure that people who would want a cake that looks just like the (hideous) thing on the cover will be pleased. However, the book won't tell them - or anyone else - HOW to make such a cake. It seems that the whole idea behind the book is to promote this ""author's"" cake-making business."
2,Cake catalog,"When I bought this book,I knew it would be very advanced,but I was very wrong. This book is a cake catalog of the things that Colette Peters can do. The pictures are great,and there are a lot of ideas,but very little explaining and how-to photos. I thought I would learn how to make crooked cakes,but it turns out I learned more from a blog than this book.If you want ideas,it's great,if you want directions,search somewhere else."
3,not bad,"same as the other moviedefiantly old style 3D conversion.story is ok might be good for some kids but not all.the 3D in this requires an active 3D tv, passive 3D will not do you much good (although some of this might look some what ok on a passive 3D tv).also some might not be able to play the 3D in this cause not all 3D tv's have a wide compatibility of older style 3D. if you tv supports field sequential 3D it will work.(as long as your bluray player supports 3D dvd's...might have to convert to sbs to get it to work)y is this labeled 2 when the kid actors are younger in this than the 1st one?"
2,horrible,Don't buy this movie even if you have kids. The main reason is that this movie should have been the first one and the first one should have been the second one. It also was pretty poorly acted.
3,delivery speed great,"package came in less than a week. Box was damaged and not indicated when i checked out, but the discs were in good shape as promised."
2,Utterly disappointing,"I tried hard hard, but couldn't find a single DVD that I enjoyed in this collection. What a waste of money! Jamie is a better actor and singer than he is a comedian. I might have laughed8 times through all three discs- not good enough. Perhaps I expected too much from Jamie. He just isn't witty enough. He has that schoolground bully type of humour. You can just picture him being the bloke that took the mickey out of the poor kids with low self-esteem. Don't get me wrong, I am no prude and I love irreverence and political incorrectnes, but I feel like Jamie tries too hard.I don't think that comedy comes naturally to him.This box set is definitely worth a miss."
4,Bemis 1043 Wick,"Wicks are great,no issues, the are not BEMIS brand, but seem to be better (at a lower price), they are stiffer when wet, so will not sag in humdifier."
2,Not a very good quality,After seeing so many reviews I bought this for $25 but it is not worth for that money. You can get better quality for that money. So I don't recommnend unless it is less than $10.
5,heart warming reading,"a great story of family, love and unusual circumstances. Easy to read - hard to put down."
5,You Gotta Get This Book!,This is the best book in some time written from the naturalistic point of view. Using the utter failure of evolutionary theory to account for the origin of life as his starting point Davies follows Crick into the foundationless morass of panspermia. The debate is over! Neo-Darwinism is nonsense. Buy this book so that you can understand the depths that naturalism forces otherwise rational people to go to in an attempt to avoid the obvious. Phillip E. Johnson's Reason in the Balance and Michael Behe's Darwin's Black Box have pounded the final nails into the coffin of Darwin's failed theory.
2,Intransigent Evolutionist,"The author is knowledgable, but clearly a product of his own statement, ""it is the job of science to resolve mysteries without recource to divine intervention."" He in one voice says, ""we will never know exactly which particular sequence of events produced the first life form."" He supports the big bang and that ""earthlife has not always existed, because the Earth itself has not always existed"" , yet he reaches for other planets, other life, out there before earth. But the big bang says nothing, no other planet, or universe, existed before this one. Still no to either the divine or intelligent design. The evidence for him is not sufficient, even when he claims it is, to look to God in any possible way. Because it could be, he will not allow that to ever possibly be. This is very short-sighted for a ""theoretical"" physicist. Until proven otherwise, give credit where credit is due. Too subjective, not objective, to be a serious consideration of other than Mr. Davies own opinion."
3,More of a nature and philisophical book,"While I did enjoy this book, the title is a tad on the deceiving side. The author is very long winded about his stories not getting published. He brings it up almost at least once per chapter. He also is very opinionated about others to the land. I found his hate and brainwashing of campfires offensive. I camp very often and a campfire is the essence of camping. It is truly sad they do get out of hand though.The instances of him having encounters of Bigfoot are few and far between. There is one chapter that is very revealing and wonderfully written, but overall your basically reading a adventure of hiking book.It's worth a read, but don't expect to learn anything you already didn't know on the subject."
1,"BOOOOO !!!! Thumbs Down, I hate this book","It is the worse piece of literature that I have ever read. I was made to read it for a college assignment.It has microscopic type. It is not reader friendly and the author is a warped sense of organization. He is totally confused and needs to read his own book. He goes North, South, East and west in every chapter. You have no idea what his actual opinion is. He totally ...!I'm sorry for you if you choose to read this book for leisure. I feel sorry if you are made to read it! I can't say it enough. this book will make a perfect fire starter for a grill or fireplace. It is also a perfect door stop or you can use it as a mouse pad (hardback version) It provides perfect traction. lolTake it from me if you don't have to read this book DONT!!! Get another book. Even if you have time to waste, don't waste it on this piece of ...!"
1,VAN HALEN THE DLR YEARS,"THIS DVD HAS TO BE ONE OF THE BIGGEST RIP OFFS EVER! DO NOT BUY!THE BEST THING ABOUT THIS IS THE COVER.THESE DLR INTERVIEWS ARE MOSTLY POST VH.NO MUSIC,NO RARE PHOTOS,NOTHING!AS FOR THE BIO,YOU HAVE TO READ IT! UNBELIEVABLE!"
5,this rocks!,"i'm from norway. i've seen extol live 6-7 times, and each time is better then the one before! i know the band members personally, and you won't believe how nice those people are! they are the coolest! did you know Ole Brud was in a band with his family called ""the Brud gang"", playing children songs, singing? it's true. Can you believe how they do that head banging on stage and still play perfectly well? its amazing.. this album contains GREAT lyrics, as well as the drums are really tight and Christer and Ole rocks the guitar so well I can't believe it... I can't see why not everybody loves this album. It is also very original. they are really unique. Do yourself a fovour and buy this cd! you won't reagreat it!"
2,Not the best,"Book is good for the cardiac history, physical, labs, and diagnostic studies but the remaining 3/4 of the book is very wordy. May as well use Harrison's or Cecil's if you want to read cardio the way it is presented in this book."
3,Be careful! Description was misleading!!!,"When I ordered this, the description said ""LARGE PRINT."" I had already tried to plow my way through the original, 8-pt type. As I am having trouble with my vision, I really NEED to have the print at least 11 or better - preferably 12! The book I got was exactly the same as the one I had trouble reading in the first place. I wouldn't have paid $20 for that book again - except I am trying to lead a study of it and have to have it for reference. It is a wonderful book, if you can read tiny print."
1,"okay, but very traditional","Most of the sample weddings are extremely religious. If you've become ordained only so that you can marry some friends, and the friends are not religious, this is not the book for you."
5,a must own for any mountain goats fan!,all great songs...listen through all songs and you won't be dissappointed...song 2 you will listen to over and over agian.
2,Kinda upset,"Don't get me wrong, this product is great for keeping your house nice and clean. Just please watch out for your clothes. My son has had these for quite sometime now and I was wondering why his clothes were getting colored. He had purple, red, and blue spots all over his nice white socks and tshirts, I even found my grey shirt had purple on it. We have nothing else but these. So I decided I was going to try something, I drew a flower on an old shirt and washed it. I can not tell you how upset I got when that flower was there in PURPLE the color I had used. This is the only downfall to the product that I have noticed. And we have the markers and fingerpaints. I continue to use them because I dont want my house in a rainbow of colors but our clothes take the brut of it all."
2,NOT an autobiography,"Do not be misled. This is NOT Montaigne's autobiography. Montaigne did not write an autobiography. (Who did, before Rousseau, 200 years later? Besides St. Agustuine.) This book (originally published in 1935) is a cut-and-paste collection of passages from the ""Essays,"" and from M's letters and diaries, notes, and journals, arranged AS IF constituting a deliberately composed autobiography. (""Aided by scissors, paste, and patience, I have let him retell his life story,"" the editor says.) Useful, I suppose, in getting some sense of the order of events in M's life. On the other hand, the book is not annotated, so you have no idea where any particular passage might have come from. Consequently, irritating, if you care anything about the original form and literary purpose of what Montaigne actually wrote."
3,"Pretty, but not nice.","Very light weight and not as heavy as it appears. It does not have grommets in the corners, which would be nice. It has little cloth tabs in which you could nail down if you aren't in a rocky area. I think they would tear very quickly though.I wish I would of waited and purchased one where I could see/feel it in person prior to purchase"
4,This bag is *b a r e l y* big enough (and why silver?),"I really feel like I'm going to bust the zipper each time I try and stuff the stroller into this bag! To the bag's credit, it's well-built and pretty heavy duty, but we'll see how it looks after a trip through gate-checking at the airport! I don't understand why a travel bag would be done in silver - it's just going to get filthy... Overall though, the seat cushion is nice, the rain cover is well-designed and I like the bag. If only it was a bit bigger..."
4,does not fit lap,This is absolutly esential. I am only 5ft 1in. and the keyboard will not fit my lap and can not stand long. Love it even if is an essential.
5,Great for our Casio Keyboard,"I bought a store display Casio keyboard and wasn't sure if any ol' stand would do, ordered this one because of the price and decent reviews and it works just fine - easy to put together and sturdy!"
4,Very good for the price.,"This is a twenty dollar piano stand. I only play causally and this is a very good stand for my use of it, but it's not of the highest of quality.A few problems arose right out of the box.The stand itself wobbles a little. Not to the point where I fear that my keyboard is going to fall off, and the problem lessened when I put more weight on it, but it would be nice if it stood complected still. Another problem is that the hex screws don't really match with any of the hex keys I tried it with. The provided key functioned, but it slipped occasionally and with one screw the key didn't grab at all.However, these problems are minimal and/or only occur on set up, so I would defiantly recommend getting this stand for casual use; it was defiantly worth the price."
4,pretty good dj x-stand,"Item requires some assembly. However, it is very simple to put together. I am using this stand for my Dj console. I am using a denon dnmc6000 loaded in an odessey flight case. Before i was using a small table which was just a little too low. This stand is the perfect height and is fairly sturdy.There is a slight wobble(if you really shake it) I am satisfied with this item. My back doesnt hurt anymore while djing."
4,Not bad,"I bought a fullsize midi keyboard. But teetering it on my lap wasnt working and sitting on a coffee table was awkward. This stand fills the bill nicely, I am about 85% happy with it. It was easy to put together. There are rubber feet on the top part that hold the keyboard surprisingly snugly; the feet on one side (the side away from you I assume) are adjustable and can slide in and out to match the depth of your keyboard. I wish it had a few more height adjustments, but for the price of 3 lattes and 2 packs of gum, it as good as I expected."
1,No Waterproof !!!!!!,I bought this camera.At 5 meters was full of water...BE CAREFULL!!DO NOT BUY!!-message to amazon:you must have no star rating option-
3,Pretty but small in diameter,"This bracelet is lovely and affordable, but the diameter of it is smaller than the rest of my wife's bangles. We had to oil her wrist to get it off, in fact. If have even medium sized hands, it may very well be too small."
2,Not quite what I expected,"I was quite excited to get this book, but when I looked through it I found that it was very wordy and not so big on substance as far as recipes go. Alot of fluff with not much in terms of recipes to try. I dont know- Im not an expert, I am just glad that I only paid 4 bucks for it."
4,Good Really Good,"Sadly by no fault of Namco, Xbox is, and was not designed to play these games.There are no after market original xbox joy sticks on the market making this gamereally hard to play.I rated it a 4 though because it is 100% authentic, well done game.There look to be no joy stick in site in the future either as Xbox originals are nowon their last legs and there is no need for aftermarket suppliers to make one."
3,Shall We Dance?,"To prevent the unwanted Princess Caroline from becoming the Queen of England, Sir Willfred orders his wastrel nephew to spy out some bit of gossip that could be used to unseat her. To do so, he is to get close to her lady's companion, Amelia Fredricks. Unfortunately, in one sense, he is as seduced as Amelia and finds himself falling for her. This makes his mission much less attractive, but how will Amelia take the news that he intends to betray her beloved mistress? What is Amelia's secret past?*** With interconnecting plots woven together, there is a certain quirkly charm that infuses this story. Though there is some mystery left unsolved, it is handled deftly so that the reader never feels the nag of dangling threads. ***Reviewed by Amanda Killgore, Freelance Reviewer."
3,Arcanum rocks???,"This would have been one of the better computer role-playing games of recent years if it weren't so buggy. Many of the problems can be fixed by downloading the most recent patch. The game system is quite interesting, and the storyline is engrossing. Technology and magic have been masterfully seperated then combined again. If you like thinking about how you can complete a quest without much info, this is the game for you. There always seem to be another way to solve the puzzle you are on. Just be careful you don't go about it the wrong way, or you could get stuck. Save often."
4,good but with problems,"To start out with its really a fun game, has a very cool story. Its 2D overhead like Fallout or Balders which is what I like personally. Problem is that the thing has lots of bugs in it that drove me crazy trying to fix just so I could play it. The combat system is a little funky and not ballanced very well if you ask me. But the story and atmospere makes up for it. What ever you do, make sure you patch it before playing.I would also like to add that its got the best re-playability I've yet to see in any time."
3,victorian england never had it so good,"Pros?The world of arcanum is excellet. Vicorian costumes, language, and sensibilities.Make the character you want. Tired of 3 to 6 differnt classes that dont fit your style of game play? Arcanum allows you to alot skill points into literally anything you want to.Numerous questsCons?Load times that can really start to suck.And, to be quite frank, you dont get enough skill points by far. To build a good party you need a 20 charisma which eats up 12 count them 12 skill points (you only get one skill point a level except every 5 levels where you get 2) then you need good dodge weapoon (melee bow fire arm) plus if you are a spell caster your spells or your technical shcmeatic etc. (f they had doubled the amount of skill points it would have been a much more satisfying experience.Bottom Line?Good game that is well worth plonking your money down for."
3,Good Purchase for Me!,I use them quite often. They are very easy to clean. I am glad I got them! I would recommend them to others.
3,I like the measuring spoons,"Has a high quality finish.Good weight.The measuring cup is not easy to use. I usually shove the measuring cups into the bag and dig out the flour.However with this tall cup, it's not easy to maneuver and you pretty much have to have the flour out of the bag first before measuring.Also, for the measure to be each, you have to fill it exactly to the top, which is the same as the other measuring cups, but when it's 10 inch's tall it feels difficult to move around without spilling.I like the concept, but stick to the regular measuring cup."
5,GREAT BOOK,This was a great book. It was written extremly well. I cannot wait to get the other two books to finish the story.
5,Great trilogy,"I couldn't put any of the three books of this trilogy down. I didn't get much sleep until they were completed. This book is the 3rd of the series. I actually started with this book first due to the subject matter and then had to buy the first two to complete my curiosity. In this book, foreign soldiers were called in by the traitorous president to fight pockets of resistance within western Tennessee. The outrageous acts committed by the foreign troops combined with those committed by the government had me held in suspense trying to learn what would be done to end the craziness."
1,"Poor, poor, poor!","The author had a great idea for a book, but failed miserably in the execution. It was an exercise see how many pages he could fill with words. Poorly written, poor plot, poor dialog. A waste of time. What he had to say, could have been written on a match book cover. Instead, he drug it out with fluff and B.S. for 568 pages. I loved Patriot by Rawles and was hoping for more, this isn't it."
5,Great read,"This book is very well written. The characters are engaging and there is a lot of good action in it. This isn't one of those books where the main character saves the day and all is right in the world. It feels more realistic and sometimes scary. It is amazing that this book was written in 2003, because it sounds like the author pulled a headline out of today and ran with it. This book shows situations that we may be facing in the coming months and it is pretty scary to think that this is how it will be. Some of the things in this book are going on already. I'm not going to spoil the book for anyone and give away any of the story, you just need to read it and see for yourself. I highly recommend this book."
2,Pretty But Not That Enjoyable,"We got this rocker for our daughter for Christmas and it looked pretty under the tree, still looks nice in the playroom, but my daughter (who is now 10 months) doesn't really pay any attention to it. We got a couple of adorable pictures Christmas morning of her on it which, because of how colorful it is, were really nice... but that's really all we've gotten out of it. It doesn't really rock very well. There's nothing very interesting for the baby to touch or play with when she's on it. She much prefers to ride around in her little car than to sit on this rocker."
3,very beautiful and study but not to playful,"My daughter recieved this last year for a christmas gift though she was only 5 months at the time so she could not really sit on it by herself or enything but I figured maybe once she got a little older she would get use of it but she is 15 months now and honestly she has never played with it. from time to time I would put her on it to see if she would take to it, but she just sits there for a minute then climbs off. she really shows no interest for it. And I do agree that it hardly rocks at all. maybe if it actually rocked it would be more enjoyable. however, I will hang on to it because it is very cute and I love the colors so I guess it makes a nice little arrangement for her room and I did manage to get some very cute pics of her on it. I would not suggest enyone pay this much for it, you really dont get the moneys worth."
5,Cable,The vendor provided these prompley and the cost was just what I was Looking for. Good Vendor and products Thanks
4,One of my favorites.,I have bought this product several times and will buy again as needed. It is all I use. Very nice product.
1,This book sucks!,"I had to buy this book for my Organic Class and I hate it! If I am going to pay textbook prices for a book, I expect it to be professionally written, not shifting into first and second person and speaking in sentence fragments. I was supposed to keep it for 2nd semester, but I hated it so much I sold it back after first semester was over. What a waste of money."
3,Possibly a little too basic,"I would recommend this book only for the absolute beginner in organic chemistry. While it does much to inspire confidence in the novice student, some of Prof. Zubrick's explanations of laboratory techniques could be a little more detailed. A better bet is Advanced practical organic chemistry, by Leonard, Procter and Lygo."
3,Infuriatingly patronizing,"In terms of information, this book deserves four or five stars, but the author's tone and style are abysmal. Instead of gearing his writing towards a general audience, he assumes the reader is a bumbling, brain-dead premed who will do anything for that A in organic lab. If you have a reasonably good TA/lab prof., there really isn't a need for this book. Otherwise, it is good to have around, since it does present information appropriate for a typical one semester intro lab course. For more advanced organic lab courses, as well as research, I would recommendAdvanced Practical Organic Chemistryby Leonard, Lygo, and Procter."
5,Works as expected so far,"Pretty simple device here. Seems to be built fairly sturdily. I used it to split the positive line from a car battery to two amplifiers. Simple, cheap, effective."
2,Mountain goats have better albums,"Having been only slightly introduced to the Mountain Goats before purchasing this album, I was disappointed to find out that this album sucks compared to the 2 or so songs that I had heard elsewhere. Not knowing much about their entire musical history, I can't recommend a better album, but they must have one."
3,Fun Movies but transfer is not up to par,"Love the Road to series. I watched them with my parents when I was a kid on VHS. While the hd-dvd versions are better than the recent dvd counterparts, it isn't by much. The Road to Rio looks a little washed out in many scenes and the Bali suffers from over saturation. I was hoping that Road to Rio would have the sharp blacks, whites, and grays of Casablanca, but it did not. Road to Bali is the best of the two, visually. Still, they look a heck of a lot better than earlier versions. The audio is cleaned up with no annoying film static.There are no special features (aside from an alternative french ending to Road to Bali) and you cannot look up anything while the movie is playing (a feature I have grown use to).Casablanca, Adventures of Robinhood, and the Searchers are waaaaay better transfers. But like I said, it's still cleaner than the DVDs.Side Note: The cover doesn't look anything like what Amazon is showing."
1,Terrible.,"Greasy and thick but this with the cleanser and serum left my skin and my husband's skin blotchy and irritated. And then since we only stopped using the soap, it made him break out terribly (he never uses lotion, but he was so dry he used this)! Of course, all this was my fault. Sigh. In the garbage it went."
2,nearly worthless,"This book doesn't contain enough information about drug metabolism, side effects, titration...basically already knew everything in the book plus it was not good for quick info checks."
1,clincal psychopharmacology,"this book is not helpful at all. it isnt clinical psychophamocolgy, it may be o for the layperson but bot providers"
1,"Poor one, not as I expected","not that fun as I expected, each toy is not that delicate. would not buy it."
3,Great escape...,"I'm pretty sure I'd enjoy having a beer with Mr. Cannell, and that feeling always comes through in his writing. He's not highbrow, just a great story teller. Shane Scully reminds me of Dave Robicheaux,from James Lee Burke,a man badly bent but not broken.I find myself more easily lost in this series than the average movie. I don't mind a gritty story, as long as you leave me with at least a glimmer of hope, and Cannell always does that.He takes Shane to the edge of the abyss, then the hand of a friend usually saves him.It's a great way to spend an afternoon."
4,Carter captures the southern venier perfectly,"Paula Carter does two things very well in this book. First she recalls all the foibles of being in a southern atmosphere and the small town activities so ingrained in many of the real southerners.Second she brings to life two excellent characters, Hillary and Jane. These two ladies are from different cultures and backgrounds and Paula uses this as an excellent device to interject humor, mismatched conversations, and off beat situations. If you are looking for something to read while your supper burns on the stove in the kitchen, then pick up this book and enjoy a delightful story. Paula knows southern culture and puts you right in the middle of it. An entertaining book with ingrained humor that just does not stop."
3,Is this the same Bruce Gilley..?,"Is this the same Bruce Gilley who reported the Chinese eating human fetuses as a culinary delicacy, for the defunct tabloid ""The Eastern Express""? That story had legs, no matter how untrue and racist. The American Christian right wing really flew with it."
4,Graduate school text,"I needed this text my first semester in graduate school. It is very helpful showing the students how best to evalute the research that is presented in this field. The text goes through each part of a journal article, telling you about what should be in each, and gives lots of examples. The text goes through all the ways that research can be evaluated. When you are finished with this text you feel very capable of reading and understanding the research of the field."
2,"Very informative, but boring",This book is really wordy and difficult to read because it is really dry. The only positive aspect of the book is the research articles that are recommended at the end of each chapter. They really help to pull all the points of the chapter together.
5,Excellent new reference for document recognition,"I have found this book to be extremely useful as a reference for my class on document image analysis. The book discusses (with software which is a bonus!) a whole bunch of image processing techniques that are very useful.Students can now find in one place- a reference for techniques such as gabor wavelet analysis, convex hulls, moments, fourier descriptors, thinning, hough transform, and chain coding. This allows me as an instructor of an advanced document recognition course to let the students self-study these image processing techniques while I can focus on the recognition topics.The authors have done a great job of picking examples from a wide range of applications such as outdoor scenes, fingerprints, and documents. The book is ""easy to read"" and requires just basics of linear algebra to follow."
4,Great guide from unbiased source,"This is a 8-1/2x11, double-sided, comb-bound ""book"" that one would expect to accompany a seminar. However, it is an EXCELLENT summary of practical lighting protection -- slides, drawings, discussion and references. The authors are not selling equipment or services; they refer to genuine engineering methods that are supported by unbiased experience and methodical study.The price is steep for something that does not have the polish and book publishing overhead -- thus the 4/5 stars. On the otherhand, one should pay for expertise!"
1,If you need this book you're in trouble!,"I read an extatic review of this book and bought a copy. Luckily I didn't have to pay for it, my company did. If anyone in my design organization would use some of his suggested solutions I would firmly grab that person by the neck and drag him to a place where he could straighten out paper clips instead of making code unreadable.To sum this book up: If you need to ask yourself the question he addresses in this book, re-write your code!Get a copy of Meyers Effective C++ books instead!"
4,Make your apartment feel like a home during the holiday's,"This video is great!!! I actually bought it as a joke, but once I got it home, I decided it was really cool. You get a continuous 3 hours run of a fireplace that has been placed on video.This video is great if you live in a home that doesn't have a fireplace. I associate a fire with the warm times that come with the holiday season. I actually played it during a holiday get together and had people ask where I got it!!!While it lacks the powerful impact of a video from the likes of Speilburg, I would really recommend this video."
3,Tongan Ninja,"I would say that if you're a big fan of Jermaine and you like low-budget/semi-homemade films, then you should see this film. It's incredibly stupid but there are some great one-liners that you can take with you. Be forewarned: the more you watch it, the more you'll like it."
2,Dense reading!,This book is for hardcore intellectuals with a bit of a leftist bent. It was written before the current expansion began so it has the premise of a failure of capitalism to create prosperity. It is also written from a very academic view point therefore many of its observations are not rooted in practicality. I found the writing style very dense.
4,works for me...,"usd manual for my used honda.... seems to have all the pages and no major wear n' tear. good buy, 'nuff said."
1,Item description inaccurate,"All there was on the site was what appeared to be a hand drawn image of the fan blade. No size was listed, so I had to order blind. The blade I got was no where near what I needed, so it was just a waste of time and money. Better descriptions need to be provided so intelligent purchasing decisions can be made."
1,Came with broken top,"This product came from China with a broken top. My guess is that if Melissa and Doug were to build their toys in America, they would be able to provide a product that would be of higher quality."
3,Sound Experiments to Classic Stuff,"The first two cd's of this are not for the unitiated. The sound experiments (similar to but not the same songs as 1974-6)come off as a psychotic version of Bruce Haack. The third cd is a different matter. This contains some of their best material including ""Do The Mussolini"", ""Nag,Nag,Nag"" and ""No Escape."" Also their twisted take on ""Here She Comes Now"". However, if you've heard Mix Up and other similar albums, there is nothing new from this period. However, if you are an extreme fan of the band and want to hear everything they did, then why not? It is Cabaret Voltaire and next to Throbbing Gristle, they were one of the best industrial bands going."
4,The Kings of Hearts,"There seem to be two dangers in reading (or writing) books about life and cards. The interplay between the card game and the characters needs to transcend the plot line of either. G.W. Hawkes succedes in enhancing what we know about the characters through the cards on the table, making this a fun book to read. On the other hand, if the technicalities of the game overshadow the novel, it's hard to read. I never understood how German lost in Pushkin's ""Queen of Spades."" I was nearly lost several times in the Gambler's Rose. While the novel was too technical for me at points, the characters are strong and their interactions are interesting. This book is a good read."
4,"Great, nostalgic 2D fighting game that still has some life in it","This is a great, nostalgic 2D fighting game that still have some life in it in my opinion. I prefer Street Fighter III 2nd Impact over Third Strike. I'm not sure what it is, but it just feels like a better game overall. If you are a hardcore 2D Street Fighter fan, owning this game is a requirement to complete your collection."
3,Not the best Capcom to date,"Sure, it's Street Fighter 3, but that's it. The publishers try to sell it as two games in one, but really all your getting is just a few extra characters and levels. If you're looking for variety, go with another current Capcom fighter like Street Fighter Alpha 3 or Marvel vs. Capcom 2, but if you want the classic, down-to-earth style and gameplay of Street Fighter and some sweet animated moves to go with it, check this one out. Personally, I'm going back to MvC2."
3,Wait for 3rd strike,"It's SF3 finally! But, the game is dated and no one plays this anymore. The only extras in this game is that you get to play as Gill. Even with the speed set much lower, you can see the how well animated the charaters are. Also, no load time!"
1,Great message but hard to read!,"As a preschool teacher, I was required to read this book. Marva Collins has a great message - ""Love the children! Find the positive things about them - and TEACH them - no matter what!"" However, there is way too much of her saying, ""Everyone is teaching the wrong way"" and not nearly enough of her telling us HOW to do it the RIGHT way. Also, she repeats herself SEVERAL times. She states the fact that Abraham Lincoln did not learn to read until he was 14 over six times. It becomes laughable! I struggled to get through it. While her message IS beautiful, it could have been conveyed in a much more precise and informational manner. Sorry Marva. I'm sure you accomplished a lot as an educator, but your writing skills are not very good."
3,Good times?,"Anything but, lol. My sister loves this show and had every season except for this one. I purchased the sixth and last season as a Christmas gift for her, not knowing she had made the purchase already. I kept it for my own collection but haven't watched it. I remember it from TV though and I have to say by the sixth season the sitcom had lost its initial vigor. The addition of Janet Jackson didn't do much to revive the ailing show, as it had lost at least two of its best actors. I would recommend it to the collector who has the rest of the collection, but not as a stand alone."
3,Great information - Short on Religion,"This book basically says, life is so complex and amazing that there must be a God. That there is no way nature can just spontaneously function this way(unless designed by a creator) and have developed on its own. It goes into great detail on a cellular level and how we function, how a baby is formed. The information is in great detail and builds a strong case but reads like a medical manual. The religious or ""God"" tie ins are barely incorperated. I think the book ""Show Me God"" by Fred Hereen is a much better place to start if you are really looking for an indisputible case for God or a divine creator."
2,Idolatry,"Schroeder's God appears to be an idol Schroeder created from the substance of his own ignorance, which he ironically calls ""wisdom"". Searching for God in the gaps of Schroeder's biological knowledge is not what I was hoping for when I bought this book.If you would like a scientific explanation of Shroeder's gaps I would recommend Sean Carroll's books ""Endless Forms Most Beautiful"" and ""The Making of the Fittest"" and Neil Shubin's ""Your Inner Fish"". I found them more palatable than Richard Dawkins books, because they were able to give scientific explanations without trying disprove religious belief."
4,worthwhile,"Artistic and informative, this documentary presented serious global issues that ultimately affect everyone. What I especially appreciated about Dirt was that economically sound working solutions were also offered."
4,DVD review,"I bought this DVD as I am interested in the video game adaptation. Of course their are differences between the two, but generally they follow each other. The art work is a little dated, but overall an interesting production.Not for minors. Blood, violence, sexual overtones, nudity.This is also a DVD that won't get a lot of replay from me. I saw it once. Might go back and watch it again at some point, but not like a favorite movie.Overall, I enjoyed it and glad I bought it."
2,Stick to the video game.,"After watching the animated movies for video games like Halo, Deadspace (Aftermath), and Resident Evil:Degeneration, I was hoping for another awesome Game-to-Movie translation but this one flopped.The movie actually starts out great but then starts to drag and some of the scenes could have loaded up on some more action and excitement. It all just becomes rather uninteresting after the first thirty minutes of the movie. Some really interesting and timeless issues are being touched upon and the story is so loaded that there is true epic potential. However, the presentation is so weak and un-involving that you just want the movie to end fifteen minutes earlier.Being a video gamer I was a little disappointed and hope for a reboot (or do-over) of this animated movie."
4,It got the job done,"I thought this book sufficed, but wasn't fabulous. I strongly preferred Moore and McCabe's ""Introduction to the Practice of Statistics"" to this book, although it didn't have a business slant to it. Moore and McCabe are certainly the way to go, though, for stats, if you have a choice at all."
2,It Broke,"I was so excited when I got my nose done, but when I went to put this in not only would it not bend, it broke. I don't know if it was because of the material or if being in the mail heated it to were it solidified."
3,OK if it arrives intact and is functional,"First order arrived with broken motor mount - bad packaging or re-packaged after return and shipped to me as new. Replacement arrived looking OK but after assembling (about 45 minutes) fan motor proved bad, would not run at all. Obviously the manufacturer has no QC or product testing. I would NOT recommend this product by mail-order. Amazon was great with handling returns. I found a unit half-price at CostCo and it works great but it is still cheaply made - but worth the $40 I paid for it."
5,This is one of the very best books for beginners.,"The Forsyth's teach all the basics for beginners in this very comprehenhive book. Both have gone on to become very respected all breed and Best in Show judges. They were mentors to the incomparable handler, George Alston. Their book is very comprehensive, and a must for any beginner."
1,Look further.,"If you ended your search on this book, I would say you can do better. I tried to read to the book taking all approaches I know, but it seems this book is not supposed to read at all. Seems like it was written not with the intention to serve but for just the sake of it.I'm not totally hopeless though, this book can be taken as an example of what techno-mumbo-jumbo means. You can read an entire chapter or a set of chapter to a client of yours and you bet not only will he be impressed but he wont get a word of it.I'll add though that I'm writing this review a long time after I bought the book as it was only recently that I `tried' reading it. If some of the info in the book is obsolete, you cant really hold the author responsible for that. But this review is considering that.I just think there are better books on the subject if you want the time you spent reading to amount for something."
2,Reading this should count as time served in Purgatory,"Slogging through this was as long and torturous for the reader as for the characters meandering around the desert, caught in papal politics and inter-tribal intrigue. A few scenes stand out vividly in the memory, such as Amen Specklebird's cave or Blacktooth's imprisonment in a zoo, but on the whole it is a profound disappointment. If it were by an unknown author, it would be less egregious; the comparison to the classic ""Canticle for Leibowitz"" is what makes it odious. I got to the last page--at least 200 pages after I would have preferred to stop reading--and realized why authors sometimes burn their manuscripts. It does leave a puzzle though: what parts were Bisson's and which were Miller's? And what condition was Miller in when he wrote it if indeed it is 85% his?"
1,Don't Bother,"Having read the late Walter Miller's ""A Canticle for Leibowitz"" in the 70's and reread it several times in the ensuing decades, I was pleased, and a bit surprised, to see a copy of his newest work ""Saint Leibowitz and the Wild horse Woman"" in a second hand book shop. After reading it I am no longer surprised at where I found it . The book is opaque and disjointed with only a vaguely outlined plot that goes nowhere in particular. I got the impression that Miller was trying to recapture the sprit of his earlier work but he ended up being a poor imitation of himself. If you want to read ""Saint Leibowitz and the Wild horse Woman"" to compare it to the earlier work, there will be at least one used copy back on the market."
1,Wild Horse Woman could have used some severe editing.,"I grew up with wide-eyed wonder reading Walter Miller's A Canticle for Leibowitz and Isaac Asimov's Foundation novel. Both were powerful and well written stories that did not rely on techno-trivia, cryptic Lord of the Rings characters, or the Penthouse magazine Letters section to entertain the reader. Alas, Miller and the writer that finished the story fell into all these traps. Its akin to reading early Heinlein and then jumping to the end of his career and reading his last stuff. A profound disappointment that lacks any of the weight of the original work. I keep a much revered copy of the Canticle for Leibowitz in my collection; I threw St. Leibowitz and Wild Horse Woman in the trash."
1,A Major Disappointment,"Over the years, I have distributed many copies of ""A Canticle for Liebowitz"" to friends - a book that I regard among the greats. It was with this reference frame that I started reading ""Saint Leibowitz and..."" As magnificent as I found the first, so I found the second tedious. It is confused, without meaningful plot, and its imagination and creativity extends only to the use of a number of ""cute"" names for people and places. I kept reading only because I thought that there must be something hidden here - anyone who wrote the first book could not have written anything as pedestrian as this. Unfortunately, I was wrong. Perhaps, as one reviewer points out, a reader may find this interesting if he/she is interested in the workings of the author's mind. But that was neither my expectation or desire. The main feeling I had when I reached the last page was: what a waste of time - mine and the authors."
1,Not what I expected!!!!,"I'd give it zero stars if I could.This is a calendar of OLD photos! Mostly Season 1, judging by the hairstyles.Each month there is a large pic and 3 small ones. The only pics from Season 3 are the cover and July (same as cover pic with the actors moved around).They used Emilie de Ravin for October and Adam Rodriguez didn't get a month!It is published by Power Star COLLECTIBLES. I never knew the name of the publisher affected the product so much.I wish I hadn't bought it."
4,Sara Bldel,"I liked both of them.special Sara Blaedel,I have read some books of her,looking forward to the next one being translated to English"
4,Very Good Book!,"I discovered Francine Rivers when I read Redeeming Love; which remains my all-time favorite book. I really enjoyed The Scarlett Thread as well. However, it left me wanting more from the story line between Sierra and Mary-Kathryn. I also felt like the end wrapped up so quickly; I'd hoped there was a couple of more chapters to digest the concluding events. Otherwise, it was a wonderful story and Francine Rivers is an awesome Christian author."
3,"After reading the Mark of the Lion Series, this falls short.",This book was kind of slow and boring. You could put it down for days and not care.I would not recommend this book.
3,Francine Rivers is an excellent writer,Loved the two stories in this book but would have liked them as separate stories! I founD the stories being intertwined a bit confusing!
2,You get what you pay for,"I have learned in life that you truly get what you pay for. This was a cheaply priced machine and the work that it does is cheap looking. When actually putting beads on things or rhinestones for that matter, the machine feels like it could snap under your grip at any given moment. It is a fun novelty for kids but the practical use is limited to non-existent."
4,Good Choice,"Good choice as a gift. As advertised, the box was blemished, however, the GeMagic unit was new. I would recommend this item as an excellent gift choice."
5,WONDERFUL PERSON!!,"I BROUGHT HAZEL FOR MY MOTHER BECAUSE SHE LOVE'S WATCHING THIS COMEDY.THIS IS A FAMILY MOVIE TO ME..HAZEL IS REALLY FUNNY,AND SHE LOVE'S TO HELP SOMEONE WHEN EVER THEY NEED HER HELP..SHE ALWAYS THINKING OF SOMETHING TO PLAN OR DO..THIS IS JUST A REALLY NICE SHOW TO WATCH.YES I WILL RECOMMEND THIS COMEDY, FOR YOUR WHOLE FAMILY TO WATCH TOGETTHER AND HAVE SOME FUN AND GET YOUR LAUGH ON. ALSO GO AND POP SOME GOOD POPCORN, WITH YOUR FAMILY AND FRIENDS.PLEASE ENJOYED ,AND HAVE SOME FUN..."
2,She should have been fired,"The reported charms of this series always escaped me. Here we have the nosiest, most interfering and unprofessional maid in history and she never gets fired or disciplined. Talk about not having any boundaries! Hazel needed to get a life because she uses the Baxter's as a surrogate family and they let her get away with it. She talks back, interferes, ignores, hands out unsolicited advice, etc. Shirley Booth is a great actress but this character is beyond annoying. Someone needs to sit Hazel down and give her a clearcut jub description so that she will do what she is supposed to do. Someone needs to sit down with""Mr. B."" and tell him that he needs to grow a pair if he expects to continue to be the head of his house and not have Hazel act like she is in charge. What exactly does ""Mrs. B"" do beside look bewildered that her husband spends more time talking to the maid than to her? Very unfunny stuff."
4,A lifesaver!,"At first I was fussing with putting files onto tons of cds, now I just copy my files onto this flash drive and then put them onto my laptop at home. It is extremely easy to use and a no fuss item!"
5,A short note about product,Simple and well working device. I'm using it with my PC and CD-changer (KENWOOD); also my wife likes its green color :)
1,review of kingston data traveler,you get what you pay for. i saved a whole ton of info on this only to get to a client's office and was able to retreive only half of my files. it is not a viable cost-effective option and i'd rather spend a lot more $$$ on a USB traveler if I know it's going to work.
3,2 GB Data Traveler,"Overall, a good low-priced memory stick. Don't plan on carrying it with you on a keychain as the cheap, plastic ring provided for that purpose will snap off within days."
4,I keep losing the cap,"The drive has been working well for me but I keep losing the cap. It's not hard to get the cap off and there's nothing to keep it from getting lost. I don't know if this problem is unique to this product, but it's a pain. So far, I've been able to find the cap each time, preventing damage to the drive itself. I like that I can keep it on my key chain."
5,Perfect,i have had no problems with this drive. the cover clips onto the back so that you don't lose it. It comes witha very small string and key chain loop to connect to your own key chain(it is very small. Overall it does the job and does it well
3,Its Alright,Works on both Mac and PC.Although i have had some issues when using with a mac. It freezes sometimes when adding items. But trying it the second time usually fixes the issue.
4,just great,"great little drive. only ""complaint"" would be that the cap and the cord do not live well together. But you can make it work."
2,Vista ReadyBoost not supported,"Be warned that, per Kingston's site, this device specifically does NOT support Vista's ReadyBoost feature. I learned so minutes after ordering it and canceled my order. I knew the cheap price was too good to be true! This would be a perfectly fine thumbdrive if you just wanted file storage, but if you want to expand your Vista laptop's memory, look elsewhere."
1,Sent it back,"I own a lot of USB drives of various sizes. I started a while ago using them to run portable applications on other machines. So I transferred everything off my 512M drive onto this one and was instantly disappointed.In a word, it is slow. Painfully slow. It took applications approximately 5 times longer to launch and close. I did some benchmarking on it and it appears the write speed is the issue - which is a factor for portable apps.Other than the speed, it functioned as advertised - but if speed is an issue for you, you might look elsewhere. I sent it back for a SanDisk Cruzer and was more than happy with that unit."
3,"Good deal, but glitchy","For the most part, this product works well, but it sometimes (for no apparent reason) will not take large files or large groups of small files. So far I've been unable to figure out why this occurs or fix the problem."
1,don't do it!,"I own a Mac PowerBook G4. Bought this to transfer pictures, and it almost always crashes my laptop-or any other mac I have used it with. Piece of junk. Other ""memory sticks"" or ""flash drives"" seem to work fine with my computer. Throwing it away. Wasted money."
3,Poor design. Can be impossible to remove cap.,I was forced to buy this at FedEx Office as they won't email my scanned files. Removing the cap was impossible. I actually had to use one of rubber grip jar openers (I bought on here. Those I'm very happy with!) to get the cap off. Finally starting to loosen a little after the first few times...
2,Key chain loop breaks in one week,The USB drive works great other then the green plastic loop breaking in a week. Now I have to buy a new one. Bottom line if your looking at putting this on your key chain stay away!
4,Good Item,This an excellent item to have when you you need to copy and carry over data. Fast shipping.
4,Nice,"This is a great device of large size with an excellent price. Speed is up and down on it but generally pretty good for USB 2.0. Also, stupid unattached cap makes me paranoid of losing it but I expected this when I bought it."
3,good price ONLY,its buffer must be small. Like 2mb. Because its rather slow copying to the drive. from the drive isnt too bad though. I think I'll get another LEXAR. My 512mb lexar is 5 times as quick
4,Good enough so far(but slow),I got this using Pepsi points and the only issue i have so far is that it is so slow.
5,Kingston are the Kings of Memory,I have tried a lot of different companies for memory related products including RAM and many of these Flash Drives. I bought a PNY USB Flash Drive and it died in three weeks.Pay a little extra and get Kingston. They don't come any better. They even show up on your file manager as Kingston.Data transfer is as rapid as it comes and never a problem. I wouldn't buy anything else.
2,wish I could say more good about it.,"I know this item is made by a small company so I was reluctant to post a negative review. However, I'm doing so to be fair to other people who want to order.What you get for your 57 bucks is: a plastic handle on a metal strip, 2 bolts, an axle the bolts screw into, an allen wrench to screw the bolts, one page of instructions, and a brochure extolling kettlebells. Oh, and two washers. The hardware looks kind of grubby, like it was made in a back alley in some 3rd world country, and has an unpleasant-smelling lubrication on it. It is not something you will want to let out of the garage.So why is it 57 bucks? I guess because kettlebells are ""hot"" right now so everything about them is overpriced. If you saw this little kit in a store, you might be willing to pay 25 bucks for it."
3,A good compromise of price and performance,"I've had this product for over 3 years and finally ordered another one.Pros:Sturdy constructionSimple designCustomizableCons:Overpriced for what you getSwapping out weights isn't easyI just purchased a second one of these due to the difficulty of swapping out the weights. I purchased again because I can change out the weights and I don't think buying standard kettle bells for varying weights is a sensible solution.If this were offered at $30 it would be a great buy, which is why I can only offer 3 stars."
5,Execllent!,"This book does not tell you how to use hacking-tools, but It teachs you how the tools work!"
5,Couldn't (would not want to) live without this one!,"If my now 6 months old daughter (who has been Sara's fan for 3 months) was writing a review, it would go something like this. ""I love to listen to Sara's CD. She has a beautiful voice that instantly makes me forget to be fussy. I could listen to her singing for hours, and indeed I do - and never tire! The song ""goop in your eyes"" makes me smile, esp when mama tries to sing along (she is NOT a very good singer). My only complaint is that the pauses between the songs are too long. Sometimes I have just enough time to remember what was making me fussy, but then I forget again when the next song starts!"" --- aah, isn't she cute?"
2,Philosopher.....,"This book is not for the average reader. If you are into abstract thinking or if you are a philosophy major, you may like this book. My view is that Cheikh Hamidou Kane was trying to impress his French audience with the philosophy he read at the University of Paris. There is nothing 'African' about Kane's storytelling. I also found structural deficiencies in the organization of the book.You would find better Senegalese writers in Mariama Ba (""So Long A Letter"") and Sembene Ousmane (""God's Bits of Wood"", ""Xala"")."
3,Why bother?,"I won't go into the specifics of the book, because the reviewer before me explained it so well.I liked the way the book started out, with the author deciding to make the perilous journey across the Sahara, up to the source of the Nile. However, as the book progressed, it took on a tone of complaining and whining about everything. He is told(with good intent) that he cannot cross the desert alone and must have a local guide/companion at all times. That's where the problems begin. He dislikes pretty much everyone whom he hires(so why hire them in the first place) and constantly blames his guide for getting lost/running out of water. He fails to understand the complexity of social interactions in ancient cultures, which results in him judging everyone by a very harsh standard.Towards the end of the book, I was possibly more eager than Mr. Moorehouse to end this torturous journey."
2,sucky menu,"my 4 yr old loves mr bean but cant play this dvd by herself, the menu is too complicated, what ever happened to ""play all"" that actually plays more than 2 episodes at a time. also, there are only 1o episodes on this dvd. didnt know mr bean was is such high demand that they could get away with that--- not like spongebob"
3,A worthy interpretation,"Dudley Nichols's widely panned adaptation of Eugene O'Neill's ambitious three-part tragedy starts off on shaky footing, frontloaded with stagy exposition, but I think it settles nicely into a sort of grim, gothic melodrama centered around a fatally dysfunctional nineteenth-century New England family. Performances, especially Katina Paxinou as the treacherous Mannon matriarch, are exceptional. The English actor Michael Redgrave (The Browing Version, 1951), while a curious choice for oedipally deranged but well-meaning son Orin, is very good (his monologue on the futility of war is riveting); Rosalind Russell, on the other hand, as daughter Lavinia is tough to pin down-- is she too old for the part or spot-on as the spinster-apparent? I'm still undecided. Image's transfer is not quite pristine, but nothing to get your hackles up about. Three-plus stars. (For five-star O'Neill, treat yourself to John Frankenheimer's 'The Ice Man Cometh' available from Kino.)"
3,Eh...,"When putting this in and taking it out, it caused a lot of discomfort. I know how to use a corkscrew type nose ring, yet this one is very sharp and uncomfortable. BUT, it did the job and it keeps my employers not noticing my nose ring. However, I did cut off the long part of the corkscrew so that it is just an L ring now."
4,Good Overall,"Dealer quoted $270 to replace alternator with no name brand, auto parts store was $190 for reman, found this for less than $150 new. Item arrived in decent time, but was damaged or poorly manufactured. Replacement was in my hands in less than 48 hours. Exactly as described, easy to install, works great. Overall good purchase experience. Would purchase again if ever needed...hopefully for a different vehicle."
5,One of the best bands in that era,"I saw Danse Society in New York back in the mid 80s and became an immediate fan. Sadly, they didn't stay together long. If one looks at the musical time line of English bands, it is easy to see/hear that Danse Society was a tremendous influence on the artists emerging later in that decade.If you like your dance music dark and moody, this is for you."
3,Don't read this book first,"This is a well written and seemingly well researched book.I am no scholar of Alexander though. This is where my frustration begins. This biography is not written in a linier or chronological style. It is more of a thematic presentation.If, like me, you are not already familiar with the characters and events of Alexander's life, you will be frustrated as the book jumps from event to event as the author explores the persona of Alexander.I will put this book back on the shelf for a while and revert back to a more conventional chronological biography."
3,The History of The Bomb,"A World Destroyed is a very good accounting of the United States's building of the first atomic bombs, with a great emphasis on the diplomatic and political players, rather than the scientists. The author has updated the book to include the latest possible historical information from recently (book was printed in 1977) declassified material. Sherwin's major shortcoming is his ability to leave the reader asking even more questions than he started with. However, it is still worth reading for those who want to know more about such a revolutionary invention than you learn in high school."
4,Great for 2.0l Saab engines,"Bought this oil on Amazon because at the time I bought it, there was a mail in rebate for Amazon purchases which made it much cheaper than at the local auto store. Shop around, sometimes the auto stores have rebates or sales on Mobil 1. This grade is typically harder to find though locally, so Amazon will conveniently deliver to your door (packaging was great).I am using this oil for our 2005 Saab 9-3 with the 2.0l engine. Unlike other people I will and actually cannot comment on the performance of the oil: in my mind all discussions on oil brands are very emotional; only a detailed chemical analysis after draining could tell me how the oil compares to other oils. I'm more pragmatic: my car needs this oil, I use it, and so far I did not have an engine failure, which means to me the oil works as intended. :-)"
5,Perfect match with VW Passat 2004 GLX,"About the motor oil:This grade is a perfect match for VW Passat GLX 2004 (VR6). My definition of 'perfect' match is:Expected Mileage with 91 Octane fuelNo change until nearly 10,000 miles.Car is already 75,000 miles old and wife and I find the drive still smooth.Not to mention that I have been using the oil and also tried other brands and have decided to stick with this for my this car.About the delivery:very prompt and hassle free delivery. Usually prefer brick and mortar business but preferred amazon for this time."
4,"Top Quality Oil, Terrible Price","This oil is some top quality stuff. Me and my buddies all use it in our Audi A8's, and that's using 8 quarts of this stuff. I have to say though that this price ($50) for 6 quarts is very expensive. At local auto parts stores such as Advance Auto Parts; the 5 quart jug of this is only $37. Plus roughly $9 a quart (not on sale) for individual quarts. So overall, great oil, top quality, but Amazon's price is way too high."
3,Graphic SF Reader,"A light hearted SF adventure, a little incoherent, and the artwork is a bit odd, the woman on the front looks like a drag queen wrestler, then an X-Man in the interior, and the relative ages of the characters seem to vary a bit. Just overall average."
1,Item is NOT as pictured,"The keyboard tray that arrived was not what is pictured, not even close. The tray itself is plastic, flimsy, and the bottom edges are sharp which were cutting up my legs until I put duct tape over the edges. I will never buy from this seller again."
1,Platform shakes/wobbles,"I installed this keyboard platform to a secure table, but the platform itself shakes/wobbles/bounces. I had to wedge a thick book between the platform and table so that the platform would be somewhat stable. I would not recommend purchasing this item."
5,This Book of Wisdom Goes Beyond Business,"Breakthrough! provides universal gems of wisdom that I have applied to more than business issues. This unique system has helped me cut through the immobilizing mental ruminations in solving other life dilemmas. I have found it to be an effective tool for proceeding forward with my personal and career goals and, as a nutritionist, in helping my clients work through an eating or exercise roadblock.Linda L. Prout, M.S., The Claremont Resort and Spa Nutritionist"
5,Healing Touch for Dogs,"Written by a veternarian, it reveals his whole soul-connections with his 4-legged family. He takes us with him as he 'walks through his life's journeys' with each one."
5,Einfach Perfekt,"Simultaneously comprehensive and concise, this is a book I recommend to any student of German grammar."
3,O.K For Some Basic Reference But That's About It,"I bought this book along with some others including : German Grammar ""How To Speak and Write It"" and the German Grammar Drills series, and loved those! However, this book I did not find half as helpful as these books mentioned. It was very basic as it tried to teach you grammar, and it left you with not much more knowledge than when you first started this book. It is basically a book of grammar ""tips"" not for a serious student of German. For the money I would seriously recommend The German Grammar Drill series or German "" How To Speak and Write It""."
3,Still a positive book,"I was really looking forward to this book, but was a bit disappointed. Dyson gives wonderful descriptions of high profile black women that DO serve as role models. However, I was very disappointed where only 2-3 chapters were devoted to the triumps and obsticles that black woman face today. Surely as a high profile professor, Dyson would have more interactions of black women that are not CEOs or actresses, but black women that you might see and meet in everyday life. None the less, it is a positive book and we still need this reinforcement."
1,Inconclusive,"This was more about Dyson and who he thinks is the Who's Who of Black Women. Who he knows, who he's met, who he's gone to church with, went to school with, etc. The fact that HIS picture was on the hardcover proves this. Someone else also thought Dyson's picture on the jacket strange, because they printed the softcover with pictures of, dare I say it, black women.This was a hard read for me, because I was expecting something else entirely. It took awhile to finish and I was not impressed. There were not enough unsung heroines. Too much of HIS experiences that black women just happened to be part of.I thought this author was going to wax poetic about black women, if you are expecting the same, save your money."
2,Not worth the price...,"I was excited to buy this product... until I got it home and took it out of it's box. Although it seemed nice enough on the box, the materials are cheap and the whole item is plastic (the ""rock background"" is also plastic.. much to my disappointment). I followed all of the instructions to put this item together and the pump still runs loud). Overall the idea of having a fountain that is illuminated and plays ""natural sounds"" was alluring... this item however made me wonder why the price was so high for a plastic box. :("
1,loud noisy garbage,"I'd give it ZERO stars. Pump makes a lot of noise, (can't even hear the water). Noise generator is so disturbingly distorted it gives one a headache. An oscillating fan works way better."
3,It's good but not that good.,"Nicely crafted piece of television that compares well with the original. The criticism that the latest version of the Twilight Zone has got I don't believe is warranted. Many of the stories in this piece of 1980s TV I would not class as Twilight Zone but rather basic science fiction. It lacks the belief you have entered the zone and more like, 'stuff happens'. Don't get me wrong, I like it, but it is far from the best of Twilight Zone. Good but not that good"
3,NO SUBTITLES,You might want know this collection of TWZ is NOT closed captioned although it says so in product details.
5,Good to go back to the zone,"I remember watching this show when I was about 14 years old. I loved it then, and I still do. I know other members have complained about the picture quality, but it seems fine to me. The stories are so original and fun to watch. Highlights include,but are not limited to:Shatterday,look Bruce Willis with hair!,Nightcrawlers,based on the story by Robert R. Mcammon,Gramma,based on Stephen KIng's short story and very scary,Need to Know, with CSI's William Petersen,A Little Peace and Quiet,Wordplay,Wong's Lost and Found Emporium,and many more.Watching this series has been a truly enjoyable experience and well worth the money. Simply put, it's awesome."
4,good season,"Im a real Twilight Zone Fan.I love Rod Serling's Original.This new season hasn't the good writer's from the original,but the new breed does the job very well.Season one is the best of all 3 seasons.You can't be wrong by this box."
4,80's nostalgia,I loved this series when it was run during the 80's. I would have seen quite a few episodes but not them all. With this box set you will not be dissapointed. The stories are by and large excellent. Always some unexpected ending that will leave you going wow. The menu was a little bit arkward as each nights episode is listed together even though sometimes an episode had two or three different stories. This does not take away from the stories only it was sometimes a bit messy finding where you had left off at the previous viewing. All in all you will have many good nights viewing.
4,Ride the rails,"Not many books have a hobo as a hero, this does. Bleak and unique, you will be introduced to a view not seen before."
2,Just say no,"[...] Plenty of better things to do than torture yourself with this attempted entertainment of imaginary thrills and convoluted plotting. Go ahead and start reading -- from this point of view you won't be able to finish the book anyway, unless, perhaps, you like sleaze for sleaze own sake."
1,Lust For Vengence,"This film is so bad it's not even bad/good..........it just stinks! It's shot on video but that is not what hinders this terrible production. The acting is awful, the camerawork is more functional than creative or interesting, the locations are boring (along with the fim itself),the story is borderline retarded, and for selling itself off as a ""giallo/gore"" film there is little of either. Even the sex and nudity (which there is quite a bit of) is more of a turn off than a turn on. I can't think of one thing I would recommend about this film. If you like cheesy shot-on-video gore/giallo type films, check out A Drop of Blood. It is light years ahead of this stinker!"
2,Cruisin 1963,"The ads fade in to the songs, just like on the radio. If you just want to hear the music, this CD isn't for you."
5,A must have,"As a very busy working mom I find Sara's book to be to the point, interesting and reliable. So far every recipe I've tried has worked and tasted great. Her tips are helpful; her anecdotes charming. Overall this book is a must have for any kitchen, especially that of a busy household."
2,"Cute shoe, but...","...so uncomfortable! After walking in them for 10 minutes, I developed blisters on my second and pinkie toes, and they chaffed the skin on the sides of my feet. Someone with narrow feet would probably do better with them (I usually wear medium width). They're so cute, though, that I'll probably wear them again...with plenty of band-aids!"
3,Does Sufficiency Contradict Authority?,"Robertson has produced a fairly careful book with an irenic tone. However, insofar as he argues for cessationism as an entailment of the sufficiency of Scripture, it had better be the case that Scripture permits cessationism and that Robertson has the right notion of Scripture's sufficiency. But the former is not so obvious, in view of I Corinthians 1 and 13. Absent a demonstration that these passages permit cessationism, Robertson's doctrine of the sufficiency of Scripture will appear to contradict the authority of Scripture. John Piper has proposed an alternative notion of the sufficiency of Scripture, namely, that Scripture tells us the means of grace to be used in every situation. Robertson's book is pleasantly brief and certainly worth reading, but I doubt that it will persuade those not already inclined toward its cessationist position."
5,Love this lamp,I have bought two of these lamps now and I am completely happy with. The only con if this counts is that the cord is brown (wish it would have been black as well). Fast shipping and still is working great. Lamp is very bright and would work great for any zebra theme. Great price as well.
2,Might not be your cup of tea,Was an interesting topic that was presented but the guy talking made it seem to drag on. Couldn't watch it for one whole sitting. It is a movie about a presentation so don't expect anything great of it. Forewarned it gets boring after a while.
4,"Good look functionality, needs some improvement.","The table looks great and is great for kids to eat together on.My two improvements to this product would be:1) If kept outside, water gets trapped inside. I would work on re-designing it to be watertight on the topside.2) The umbrella is nice, but there is a handle that my daughter always goes for that is right at eye level. When she turns it, it goes from full height to dropping on her head. I'd redesign that too."
4,The hit of a one year olds birthday party,"This table was well used at my grandson's first birthday party. It was loved by all the kids. It is so nice to be able to just spray it off when done and it is like new.The umbrella could be a little better quality and easier to use on a deck. When on the deck, the umbrella will not sit up straight as the peg is made to go into the ground.We thought the benches would be a little stronger. Have to be careful that no one too heavy sits on one of them."
3,Not one of Little Tikes finest....but...,"I've loved and owned Little Tikes for many years. I have four children with ages spread out over 20 years. I have probably owned close to every product made by them and I have to admit, I was disappointed in this one.I LOVE the design.Assembly takes forever. It's not your typical 1-2-3 Little Tikes assembly. A million screws.I was very disappointed that when a small child sat on the table portion, it immediately dented and left an impression (dent and streaking in the plastic). I realize that the child that was here should not have sat on it, but if you are use to the older Little Tikes tables, then this might be a slight disappointment to you."
4,Good buy,"This table is great for what it is. My son loves it for eating, coloring, playing etc. The only downside is the 'collapsable' or 'foldable' isnt as foldable as lead to believe. it does collapse but it requires you to take off the locks by unscrewing the nylon wingnuts."
2,Description should have been better,Yes this fan is slient but it is a 1500 rpm fan not a 1700 standard fan.I recommend this to people that have small PC cases not mid size.
5,Most valuable book in my Christian library,"I have received more graces through this book than any other in my library. Ken Gire knows how to make the Bible come alive in very real, truistic ways. A definite +++"
2,Didnt work,Very sad that i didnt get amazing results. I would actually leave this in my hair for longer than two minutes and it still did not help any. My hair is so rough and horrible split ends i dont know what to do. I will def not repurchase this!
4,Truely Conditions,I had been a brunette and when i went back to my natural blonde my hair was suffering from the process. Used this to bring back the natural silky texture to my hair!
2,Allergic reaction,"I bought this conditioner for my Mom who has parkinsons disease. The Parkinsons has left her hair very brittle so we thought this would be great, and since she was using it, I thought I'd try it on my own hair. Although I believe the product has done both of our hair some good, we both came down with an allergic reaction. Both of us started to get itch welts along the hairline after using the product for a few weeks. We live in different households, so the only thing we had in common recently was the use of this product. So just beware"
2,Really disappointed...,"I've used this product for about 3 weeks now. I feel no positive difference in my hair, and if anything, my hair feels a bit dryer than before even. I'm discontinuing the use of this stuff and moving on to a (hopefully) better reconstructing conditioner that will actually help. This stuff really wasn't for me."
5,Funston's and America's Greatest Special Forces Action,"I must agree with a prior reviewer that this is a great book that detail's Funston's plan to capture the leader of the filipino resistance and end the insurgency that followed America's invasion of the Philippine Islands during the Spanish American War. Funston's action can only be described as audacious and was tactically successful. While it did not end the resistance, it should have gone down as one of the most successful small unit raids ever conducted in Military History. Funston used indigenous forces along with a small contingent of American soldiers to achieve his goal and capture Aguinaldo.I wonder why there are not more books available on Funston. Be that as it may, this book does justice to Funston and his raid."
3,Tea book,"A just OK tea book. Not too interesting. I wanted a book a little more information. And, too many herbs per cup."
2,"Works, but does not hold charge","Seem to work, but does not hold charge for as long a the one from Verizon."
5,Good Story,"I tripped over this book because the author has the same name as another author I like. I read about it and decided it sounded like something I was in the mood to read.I'm glad because I really enjoyed it. An interesting concept of an AI taking over the world and planning to grow and expand the human race, and thus herself.Stubborn humans don't want to cooperate!"
4,good but a few caveats....,"Overall a great performance but WHY ON EARTH did they cut out Leonore's ""Tu vedrai che amore in terra""? There's an immediate jumpcut to Act 4, Scene 2. Was very disatisfied with this, as it is one of my favorite parts of the opera. Also beware, the listing says one disc but the opera is actually split on 2 discs. Kind of annoying if you want to watch the thing straight through with no breaks or interruptions(like me who is an opera fanatic). Fantastic singing from Domingo, he is in top form and I'm glad I bought it for that."
4,Get caught up!,"Caught in a Trap is the story of escaping an abusive husband, personal growth and finding a love well deserved. Jane Pierson determined to have a better life, planned a way out and succeeded. Along the way, she found a new love who would appreciate her. The author, Andree Michelle, displays a wonderful sense of humor, an ability to write sensually and to write a story of substance. Her portrayal of Devon illustrates abusive, irrational husbands well. Kyle, the new love needed a bit more development; the only reason I rated this story a 4 rather than a 5. Aunt Rita's character was brilliant! Ms. Michelle has gained a readership here. I will be looking to read her next offering."
5,"May not be perfect for everyone, but works great for me!","This book is arranged into topical sections and provides on one page literary examples of various words and such and other other page lists of various descriptive words fitting a theme.It's not quite a thesaurus, per se. But it's a great resource for thumbing through to expand your vocabulary or poking through if you're looking for that just right ""obscure word"" to describe a given thing or situation.As others have probably said, an index would be nice. But, c'est la vie. It is what it is. And it is a great book! If you like this book, you'll probably also likeThe Thinker's Thesaurusor for those preferring things a little more Eldritch:Weird Words: A Lovecraftian Lexicon. All great book for wordsmiths, philologists, and men of letters."
3,Good,The book is very helpful in general. It segregates the genres well. The only real problem is that itbis difficult to wade through at times.
4,Aaron's review from Vass-Lakeview Elementary,"This book is about a little girl named Sarah Ida who wants to make her own money. So that she could make money, she got a job at a shoeshine stand. In the beginning of the book, Sarah is selfish and towards the end she gets kind and giving.The books message is to never take money or hang out with people who do. I especially liked it in the story when she got her job with Al at the Shoeshine stand. I disliked it when she took the money from her neighbor friend. Overall this is a great book!"
5,Another Home Run by ATK,"I am a big fan of ATK and a subscriber of Cooks Illustrated and Cooks Country, but can't get enough of their cookbooks. This one has a nice selection of recipes from the show, the magazines and some of the other cookbooks. Their recipes never disappoint and I am anxious to try some of these recipes just as soon as the Christmas ham is gone."
4,Expensive But Reliable and 5 Year Warranty,"You get what you pay for. With this model, your paying for reliability and warranty."
5,"Powerful, quiet and convenient!","I got this baby to replace my Antec 550W PSU which failed on me after only 1year of use. The first thing you'll notice is that this PSU is HEAVY! This is always a good sign when picking a PSU. From the grill, you can see that its got massive heatsinks inside adding an extra cooling solution the the 120mm underbelly fan installed. The modular cables included are more than enough to meet all your power connections for PCI-EX, SATA, IDE, 1.44 drives and more. I currently have 3 Hard Drives, 2 DVD burners, 1 powerhungry GF8800GTS and a boatload of case / chipset fans installed and this beauty runs smoothly without a hiccup.All the cables are color coded (along with the PSU connection sockets) so installation is but a simple snap.It doesn't include any flashy fans lights or connector LEDs like other brands, but its shiny-glossy black finish makes it an eye pleaser.Overall when rating PSUs its the raw muscle that counts, and this baby has plenty."
4,Advanced Scroll Saw Clocks,"Having built 2 of the 5 clocks shown in the book, I can attest the dimentions are fairly accurate. What I really enjoyed about the clocks was the brief history he gives at the begginning of every clock. It gives you something to think about while you are spending the hours of tedious scroll sawing. I did not find these clocks to be overly difficult to build, but they were complex. I enjoyed the two clocks I built and am planning a third."
2,The Ringer Worm,"Bill Scheft is a funny man. Just ask him. Or listen to him.But asking Scheft to write a novel is like asking Shemp to do Shakespeare, you just don't do it.Don't mistake it. Scheft knows sports, humor, and has a wealth of lifetime experiences. I also must be his target reader: White, middle aged, college educated, sports fanatic, borderline alcoholic. But the one dimensional characters, distracted dialogue, and shallow plot lines, make one trifecta no one should bet.The humor comes off like an inside joke that you aren't party to, there isn't enough sex to make it interesting, and you end up hoping the characters die before you do -- of boredom.The novel went from 'can't put down', to 'won't pick up'.I suggest you don't either."
3,World of Downspiriling Inspiration,"So the old world of darkness ended in a less than satisfactory bang, and the new world of darkness is here, with the paradox that it always has been here, hasn't it?I have to say I like the game mechanics for the new system a little more. But the story of the old games a lot more. Werewolf the Apocalypse had a lot more going for it than the Forsaken. And Vampire the Masquerade, with the 13 clans, is a lot better than Vampire: the five clan watered down for easier public consumption and mass marketing so we can make ""bloodline"" books."
1,Answering Function Does Not Work,"As previous reviewer described the answering machine function simply does not work. It either answers and then hangs up, or just keeps ringing. The only option is to ship the phone back and wait up to six weeks for a replacement, sounds as those the replacement might not work either! Try another product!"
2,Buy a different phone,"I have purchased two of these phones, because they were cheap. Both quit within a year. On the last phone, it was the answering machine that just totally quit working. It's definitely not worth the money."
1,Lousy sound quality,"I didn't have problems with the answering system the way the other reviewers did. I thought, however, that the sound quality was terrible. It sounded like I was talking with my head in a bucket. Moreover, when I was at a remote location talking to a family member who was using the phone I had trouble understanding him or her. I didn't buy the phone from Amazon and fortunately I still had the receipt and packing materials, so I returned it after a week and purchased a Uniden, which works much better. Buy a different phone!"
4,Not bad,"This phone is decent. Nice to have Caller Id and Speakerphone in one for an inexpensive price.My only disappointment is that the red light above ""Play"" does not blink when you have a message waiting. I'm not sure why they designed it that way. We had another GE phone that blinked when you had a new message. The only way to see if you have new msgs is to turn a light on and see the LCD display. Well now, actually we found out that if you push the Play button, it will tell you if you have new msgs or not. So don't have to turn the light on above the phone.So overall a decent phone. Just a little disappointed with no blinking light, after having it before."
3,Where is the baby ?,This story takes place in the early 20th century and seem to be written in a style of that time period.The main charcter who is investigating the missing baby seem to be the American version of Sherlock Holmes.Not very much of a mystery by todays standards Would not recommend this novel.
5,Very informative and easy to understand.,"Dr. Amen, speaks the truth and from personal as well as from professional experience. I have read practically everything he has wrote about the brain. He doesn't disappoint. Helps the reader understand ADD whether its a friend, a loved one or yourself offering both traditional as well as alternative therapies. He makes understanding the brain so fascinating. If your into making your brain healthier for a much happier possibly disease free life and reduce your risk of Alzheimer's and dementia try some of Dr. A men's more recent books."
4,just a book,Timely shipping and talks about the 6 types of brain disorders which could be the cause of ADHD. Kind of interesting
2,Very Humorous Book,"I found that the typical but useless psycho-babble about ""brain dysfunction"" in this book pretty much keeps to the standard psychiatric biochemical line about how the brain works. It's interesting that there are currently a number of class action lawsuits against the American Psychiatric Association claiming that ADD is a fraud, i.e. a non-existent disease claimed to be a disease by the APA to gain business at our children's expense. This book is nothing but a continuation of the fraud.However, Dr. Amen's novel treatment approaches and pseudo-scientific pontifications aside, this was a very entertaining book. And, if you want to see why psychiatry is a dying industry with no workable answers, read it."
5,ADHD info,This book was very informative in helping me to learn the etiology ofADHD and how to deal with it. It gave a laymans term description of the types of ADHD and how to work with each type.I have purchased it and often refer back to it.
1,DESTROYED MY iPOD!!!,"when this item arrived, I was very excited to hook it up and use it with my iPod mini. But when I hooked it up, I noticed that my click wheel was completely non-respondent. I sent my iPod back to apple thinking that it was the fault of the iPod, not the speakers. Well about an hour ago, my brand new iPod came in the mail. I hooked it up to the speakers and the same thing happened!!! DO NOT BUY THESE SPEAKERS!!! even though i was covered by apple, i still had to pay thirty bucks just to get it there. CTA digital better be paying for my iPod or I will be forced to take legal actions."
5,compact little speakers,After opening it and inserting four AAA batteries(not included)I switched the thing on and saw it was just what I needed. There is even an on/off switch and a little blue light to show you when it's turned on. It folds up neatly into a cube after sliding out the piece that makes it stand up
3,Second time around,The first time I bought this product it was a flop but after contacting the manufacture they sent me a new one and it works just fine. Thanks fellows
4,great little speakers,"i use these with my video ipod my daughter watches dora etc on it, the sound is great if you dont want it playing really loud, i use it for music in the kitchen etc. seems durable so far my daughter chucks it around and pokes the silver parts. even fits my ipod while it has a back up batery pack attached. my husband has the sonic impact speakers, but am getting him one of these as well they are so compact! got mine on overstock, cheaper at amazon even after shipping."
2,Economy Speaker,The CTA Digital iPod speakers are a good choice if you are looking for low priced speakers to use with an iPod. The audio quality isn't outstanding but acceptable for occasional use. The only major annoyance was the requirement to turn the iPod Nano upside down to place in the center holder since no allowance is provided for the connecting cord.
2,What I asked for.,"This is what I expected and what I asked for. I was looking for a small travel size speaker to use with my IPOD for traveling, camping, playing on a boat - where more than one person would enjoy the music background. If you're looking for something to sound digitally perfect - this isn't it. But it worked wonderfully for my purpose."
5,Perfect all purpose pail,"I love this pail. I ordered it because I liked the easy access lid, and the dimensions. We use it in the bathroom with a little borax to soak soiled baby items. I love how easy it is to pop the lid off, and how effectively odors are sealed in. 6 months of daily use, and it still looks great and is just as effective. Looking forward to owning this fine pail for years to come.,"
2,blaaaahhhhhhhh.........,"This book was a VERY slow read. I expect the beginnings of books to be a bit slow, it always takes me a while to actually get into a book. This book was that way through the whole story. I would not recommend this book to anyone."
3,Memory lane,Really enjoyed hearing DJ Portky Chedwick. We grew up listening to the daddy of the radio. Anyone who enjoys 50's music and real DJ's would love this.
3,A little disappointed,"First than all I should say that I saw very good commentaries about this movie, and maybe for this, I was disappointed when I watched it. Other reason can be that in my country the myth of trolls is not popular and is hard to find someone that believes in these monsters. The film is not so bad, but its suspense's atmosphere and its characters never touched me and for this reason Troll Hunter is not gonna be one of my favorite horror movies."
3,It's okay.... if you believe.,"If you grew up believing in fairy tales and such, then it's okay. If not, after about 40 minutes, you might get bored. Had to watch in two parts. Interesting characters, but not that great of actors."
4,Surprisingly Enjoyable and Really Well Done,"I was surprised at the quality of this Norwegian film. It takes the guise of a documentary done by a group of college students that think they are filming a bear poacher. I really liked the story and the special effects were extremely well done, in my opinion."
3,Higher Budget Blair Witch Type of Film,"I can't understand they hype this film has received. I found it boring and lacking in plot. The special effects are fairly good, what there are of them (not much). There are supposedly several types of trolls, but viewers get to see only 2 types briefly. The filming pretty good quality, but there is little suspense as you know this is supposed to be found footage, thus the viewer knows from the start that the film crew didn't survive the super fast and confused attack at the end of the film. I thought it was a fun idea to use the troll concept, but the idea was wasted. Most of the film is trying to locate living trolls, chasing the clues, and then there are the quick moments during which we actually see a troll. The CGI is good but goes by too quickly to enjoy. Rent this one."
2,Blair Witch Project with large CGI.,"It somehow doesn't seem original, so many flicks have been produced in this style, the visual effects were on a par with the old godzilla movies."
4,Trolls Really?,"This movie is quite possibly one of the weirdest movies I've ever seen. It is quite dry and predictable in parts then goes completely nuts just because they can. It may be obvious but the troll hunter character is just plain weird. I am horrified any govt agency would allow him to use a firearm.All in all, not a waste of my time, but probably could have found something better. But I will give the movie mad props for having the tie in to real life at the end. :)"
1,What a waste of time...,"I viewed Troll Hunter free with Amazon Prime. Sometimes, you get what you pay for. The reviews of Troll Hunter make it sound like an interesting premise, but you never end up caring about any of the characters. And none of the characters care much when one dies. Uneven, unfinished."
1,FOR WHOM THE BELL TROLLS,"An original concept is sabotaged by the never-ending mockumentary trend in horror movies. This dubbed Norwegian entry is becoming a cult favorite and I frankly can't understand its appeal. It's not really funny nor scary. The troll effects are okay, and there's a certain ingenuity in the various troll appearances. But the movie is incredibly slow and the jerky camera work is nauseating. The script is mundane at least in the dialogue department and the ending way too abrupt, not that I was sorry to see it end.I'll be glad when the lost tapes fad fades and movie-makers rely on story and skill instead of tired gimmicks."
1,disapointed,"This wouldn't have been a bad movie, if I could of understood it. Being in another language where you have to read the whole movie was a bummer. It would have been nice if you would have said it was not in English."
2,Trolls....trolls......trolls......,"This movie is pretty boring. First of all it's all subtitled, the effects are decent....some of the trolls look awesome while some look pretty ridiculous. The acting is pretty flat. Too much time is spent explaining the troll situation instead of kicking troll ass.2/5"
5,"Definitely ""outside the box""!","This movie is like nothing you have ever seen. Filmed in the Blair Witch style with great acting, believable characters and a very unique subject.The trolls were way better than expected. If you are looking for something different, here it is!"
1,I Call B.S.,"Okay, I initially disagreed with the logic of some of the one-star reviews here, but after reading the entire book, I now have my own reasons for seriously disliking it. COME ON PEOPLE, the guy made up at least half the patient anecdotes. He's the Jason Blair of psychotherapy. He's certainly no Oliver Sachs. I work with teenagers with both special needs and gifted needs. They DO NOT speak like that. His quotes are largely fabricated. My b.s. radar is still beeping loudly. His name is not worth remembering. The patient who made him famous - Karen Carpenter - DIED. His focus on primarily female psychological disorders is creepy. To quote everyone's favorite fictional OCD character, Adrian Monk, ""I could be wrong, but I'm not."""
2,Best Doctors for Big Cities,"Since we are moving to a new city in Florida, we wanted to check out doctor possibilities there and ordered the Castle Connoly Guide ""How to Find the Best Doctors"", Florida edition. The first section of the book gave some practical advice about choosing a new physician. When we turned to the selection, however, we discovered no doctors where we were going and only one where we now live! My personal experience with the latter was so disastrous I would not recommend her to an enemy! If you live in a really big city, this book might be useful but not if you live in a smaller town and want a local doctor."
5,I like being an informed consumer when it comes to my health,"This Castle Connolly guide gives you a tremendous amount of information on top doctors that have been nominated by other doctors. And I'd rather have some independent company do reserach and tell me that a dotor is really good than just get a list from my managed care company!!I like the info about their background and training, but I was really impressed by stuff like whether they took new patients, how long it would take to get an appointment, HMO's and even foreign languages they speak in the office. I think it would be very helpful for faamilies and seniors too."
5,A voice of America,"Buffy Sainte=Marie cultural roots are those of her Cree tribal family background. On her Best of album are to be found the thought provoking self-penned songs that have made her the spokesperson of the indigenous tribes of America.Joy and sadness are found in abundance here. Ground Hog is a celebration of life itself, I'm Gonna be a Country Girl Again says volumes about the sense of nostalgia felt by the exile; at the heart of songs such as these is a sense of felt joy. In contrast are Buffy's ballads, which are songs of 'monumental' sadness; Cod'ine is a grim comment on drug addiction and My Country 'Tis Of Thy People You're Dying is a shocking revelation of the history of America.Possessing a voice of astonishing vocal range, Buffy has been writing and performing her music for nearly fifty years. This album encapsulates that life."
3,GREAT WORKOUT,This is a great tape.I was upset the ab bar didnt come in the mail.SO BEWARE.I emailed the seller and he refund my money back so it worked out.
4,Terrific product,I am 90% satisfied with this product. I would like to see a cd added to list of options to the record/burn option (#1). I would suggest a 8x or faster cd or dvd when you are burning. Anything over 1 hr you will need a DL dvd. If you have SP3 on your Windows XP you have to go to manufactureres web site to download update which is easy to do. Be sure to change the name of your film clip when you save it or when you pull up clips to burn your list will be a random numerical list. I would suggest that manufacturer include a printed manual instead of a pdf which you have to print out for instructions.
3,VHS to DVD 3.0 Deluxe,"The hardware device,that was included, was simple to install with the directions given. It gave a great image on the computer screen. The software got the job done but I think that the ""editor"" leaves much to be desired. I tried to delete a short section of video(5 to 10 minutes)and was unsucessful. If the company comes out with a ""4.0"" version, I hope they will improve the editor."
1,Capture device incompatible,"After much testing and several calls to Tech Support, I was told that the Honestech USB capture device is not compatible with some computers. I have a Soyo motherboard with Win XP. I was disappointed that it didn't work, because the package seemed just what I wanted. Tech Support helpful and polite."
2,Poor vidio and audio sync,"I guess you get what you pay for .......The audio and video are so far out of sync it is annoying to watch. I believe another reviewer mentioned this also. Not a bad price for the performance, but I discontinued using it and put it in the closet. Just too frustrating."
1,What a Disappointment,"I got this product a while ago and never got it to even install. I had given up on the transferring project. I bought a new capture device from a different company, but before opening it I thought I would try to install the Honestech one more time. It didn't install, but I did find an update online. Installed the update and it installed. Hurray I thought. I started the app and my computer's camera came on... looked hopeful, but I can't seem to get the TVBox to show up as the device to capture. Only the camera is an option. What a waste of time and money. Also if you call for support you will probasbly go to voicemail, they'll call you back. It's really a zero star product for me."
4,Pretty cool,"I have never used a transfer software before, but this was pretty simple to use. I have already transfered 2 movies to DVD and it is just like owning the real thing. I also like the audio transfer feture. I would recomend this product"
1,Five stars?!?,"I don't know how folks could rank this product so highly--it crashes regularly, is very clunky and slow in compiling and burning, and the edit functions are simplistic and non-functional. I ran on both Vista and XP machines. I don't recommend. In fact, using this product will cause you headaches and lots of wasted time."
3,It's mainly about the hardware,"A good price and effective program, but experience has shown me it's about the hardware, not the software and computer. The slowness, the absorption of one's time and concentration, the storage requirements--all somehow manage to conspire to produce as many misfires as successes. And the prices have come down not only on the software but the self-sufficient VHS-DVD player-recorders that will all but do the whole job for you. You won't have professional-looking titles, precise chapter divisions, etc., but if you intend to convert more than a handful of tapes to DVD, and if your main objective is preservation, a stand-alone machine made for the purpose is the way to go. (A lowly Sylvania costing a couple of hundred has served me well for two years.)"
2,Not recommended.,These rechargeable batteries are not the best quality. Hardly enough for 2 hours of use after each charge. Not recommended.
1,This is a Christian book,"I ordered this highly recommended book for my 8 year old daughter, who has been having a difficult time since [seeing traumatic world events]. Was I ever surprised to find that nearly one third of the chapters encompassed Christian topics (Christmas, Easter). We are a Jewish family, and I certainly would have expected to see this information included in the description of the book. Also, I must say, neither my daughter nor I found the book appealing in other ways--I think its really more appropriate for preschool aged children. (who are Christian!)"
4,A Positive Story About the Twin Towers,"This is an amazing book! Not only is the story inspirational, but the illustrations are beautiful, and definitely deserved the 2004 Caldecott Medal. Gerstein tells the true story of a French street performer who dared to walk a tightrope between the Twin Towers. The tale is told in a way that appeals to both children and adults. Because the story is non-fiction, the characters and the plot are quite believable. The main character's adventurous spirit is exemplified by the detailed illustrations of his daring feats. However, I feel that Gerstein only showed the main character's side of the story. The stunt pulled was illegal, and the resulting consequence sounded like fun, rather than a punishment. Overall, the story is well written. I truly appreciated learning a story from the early days of the Twin Towers. I would recommend this book for a classroom."
3,Not as good as expected,I bought this book as a gift. It is great book unfortunately the book was damaged on the corner when it arrived.
4,A first American view,One of the first American views of the MIS-X program. Previously the British have written about their experiences from the MI-9 and MI-19 perspective. Much of the work of this unit has been still kept classified. There was some unit activity in Southeast Asia and elsewhere in Japanese controlled POW camps. My grandfather was one of the unit's commanders and later CO of Fort Hunt at the end of the war.
5,A soul awakening,"This book is full of enlightenmentthat each heart needs to open up toothis book sings to the heart and opens one soul to lightvery inspiring, Lia's book is magic that is all about one LIFEand what we really are."
1,Horrible Product/Service,"The case that I purchased from them did not fit my product very well at all. For as much as you pay, it should fit perfectly, and feel very durable and solid, which it didn't. The soft material that it's made of feels alright, but attracts dust and lint like nothing else, and causes the device to stick to fabric, like the inside linings of pockets, very annoying. Even though the company failed to deliver a good product, they did an excellent job of giving me the worst customer experience I've ever received from any type of transaction. It took them up to a week to respond to various emails I sent them, and I felt like my questions were never fully ansered, sometimes ignored. Do not buy this item, or any other item, from the BoxWave Corporation."
1,Walnuts? where are the walnuts?,I am very disappointed in the quality of these walnuts. They are pure sugar and have very little toffee flavor and the walnuts are all bits and pieces of left over walnuts. I could not find 1 walnut halve in an entire package.
3,Loves Barney but not this.,My daughter loves Barney so I bought this for her. It was the best deal I could find with shipping too. I dont take it in the bath tub though. She loves barney and thought she would love to have a stuffed animal of him but wasnt even interested for 3 minutes and still hasnt taken a second look at it.
3,Dennis anyone?,"this Cd is OK...(my 3 stars is really just a 2 1/2)...but why not just get Matt Dennis doing Matt Dennis? plenty of Dennis' CDs out there...and thet're all better than this one. Matt Dennis' tunes and delivery have an energy that Mz Conklin lacks. Back when, I had the good sense to go see him perform one snowy nite in a little NYC club. If you get ""Matt Dennis sings Matt Dennis""... you'll get the true feel of the guy and his music."
1,Nice shirts,Great price. Good quality. Timely shipping. Wish they had more in different colors.Chuck S.
5,Excellent book in the field,"I received this book as a gift, and it totally changed my view of this field. This book provides details explantion of missile dynamics, guidance, and flight control theory and basic principles, in particular, because of author's real world experience, this book could give you a brief view of what happened in the missiel guidance society. It also contains some chapters never have been pulished before, such as delivery weapon system. I highly recommend this book to graduate or undergraduate students who working on the guidance and control or related areas, you will not regret your purchase."
1,The Weavers Greatest Hits,"I was very disappointed in this CD. Most of the songs were done ""live"" and the quality was no where near studio quality. And the audiance applause was a real distraction. My favorite Weaver song, ""Good Night Irene"" was so poorly done that I could not listen to all of it. I'll probably not listen to this CD again. What a shame. I was really looking forward to enjoying this CD."
5,Weaving a great listening experience,"The Weavers ain't gettin' any younger. One of them is already in a wheelchair. I saw Pete Seeger up at the Clearwater Festival in June and he was so frail. They just drove him around everywhere. Point? This ""twofer"" or double album was recorded in the height of their youthful energy. They were never better and will never be there again. This album is a great historical ""record"" of their music career, controversies and all."
5,"Best C.D. since ""and the stars go with you""","This is my first review I have ever written but after listening to Blue Cosmos for the first time yesterday I was totally amazed. I bought ""And the stars go with you"" in the early ninties and I have been looking for another C.D., a part 2 so to speak all this time and I have finally found it with Blue Cosmos. Meg Bowles is brilliant and I highly recommend this C.D. for any lover of Ambient/Space music. I bought this C.D. without listening to the sample tracks just on a whim and I must say it was the best investment in music I have made in years. I am a loyal fan of Jonn Serrie but if Meg Bowles keeps this format we just might see that Jonn no longers rules the Space music genre. This C.D. is a must"
4,A true coffee table book,"This book is fascinating. It is one you can pick up and browse a bit and become lost in the art and imagery of an icon that is so familiar we rarely take a good look at it. By sharing his collection with us, Mr. Hinrichs takes us beyond the simple stars and stripes to a visual history of our country.Anyone familiar with graphic design should recognize Mr. Hinrichs' work. The overall presentation of the piece is incredible. I call it ""the true coffee table book"" because I think it is one can be opened and looked at and enjoyed a few pages at a time, and isn't that the purpose of a coffee table book?The timing of the work is fascinating. Although initially published this spring, it is extremely appropriate for the new wave of patriotism that has swept this country since the tragic events in September."
5,Awesome!,"Awesome Barry Bonds McFarlane! Great item for baseball collectors, a must have display. Great detail, McFarlane are the best for collectors!"
4,scooby chi,"My son had been waiting to get one for months! He was very excited to start it growing. The seeds were easy to manipulate and it sprouted quickly. I was a little smaller than I expected, but quite nice."
4,Easy to read,The concepts are so clearly explained that with no biology in my head - I am an engineer- I was not intimidated and learned enough to decipher the medical jargon at work.
4,"Unit Bloches, Gameplay Ups, SP Downs, MP Good","Dark Reign 2 is awesome game. They have really outdone (and sucked) at this game.Pros: This game has a brand new engine, which can run as smooth as an Unreal Engine on one of those new Gigahertz PCs...Units are detailed up close and still appear detailed from far away (but aren't...nice) Units are well balenced. JDA has the Guns, Sprawl has the Defensive. Also, nice Map Studio.Cons: Use of Formations. They suck. You get 4 Formations, which they take 4 Minutes to get in a 5x5 Box Formation. Even after that, they are still not in full formation! NEED FIX! Group Ops. If you move someone in the middle of a group, they won't get out for 5 minutes. Units Slows. These units are super slow. On SP, there is in the readme a 'speed up' command. It hardly works. It speed my Guardians, to get from the bottom of the map to the top of the map, from taking 5 minutes, to taking 4 1/2 Minutes.Buy/Rent: BUY! You can't do everything in 3 days."
2,All Hype No Substance,"At first look the game is beutiful. I'm a die-hard RTS fan and I am glad that the genre is moving toward 3D (Ground Control, Earth 2150, etc). The real problem with the game is the gameplay itself.First I'd like to point out that the camera model or 'perspective' as it is called is severely lacking. The camera can only be position up, down, left, and right. With many passages in the game on a 30-45 degree angle it is very hard to view the action. I wish Pandemic would have allowed the freedom to rotate the camera a full 360 degrees (maybae by holding the Shift, Alt, or Ctrl keys while moving the mouse.Secondly the missions just are not fun! There is no fast and frantic gameplay. Taelon extraction and unit creation is just too slow."
2,Save Your Money for Star Craft,"This is a semi-decent game. It will keep your attention for about 2 hours. Basically you play the Federation, Klingon, Borg or Romulans. You control ship production and deployment. Of course there is mining and resource management. For the most part this is basically Star Craft with Star Trek ships. The graphics are mediocre and the AI is horrible. The AI doesnt re-build once you destroy the enemy bases. I would wait on this game until it goes into the sale bin (and it will head there fast). This could have been a really promising game, the ship designs and attributes are ok-and I like the feature of being able to transport troops onto enemy ships and then take it over. Aside from that, there really isnt anything special about this game.Thumbs down!"
3,Snap Judgement: 3 of 5,"Cool use of ST: TNG, but the game play good be a little more dynamic...StarCraft is still the barometer, and this doesn't beat it. Nice graphics, though"
4,Beware!!!!!!!!!!,"This is an excellent game for any strategic game fan. some reviews have all been consentrating on the fact that the game has a few glitches. i am one of the few who has had the pleasure of not expiencing most of these problems. the key is; let me start by saying that this game is extremly complex, even for a computer. For instance my computer is a Pentium III at 433mhz and about 128mb of SDram. for those who don't know what i'm talking about this is an ideal for Armada. LOTS OF MEMORY! the only way i think anyone can fully enjoy this game is with a computer that can operate it. i also think it is an unfair perspective for those who have a lower grade computer to judge this game without playing it to it's full extent."
5,Best game since Starcraft!!,the game engine allows for scinerios where you don't ever face the same situation time and time again. the graphics are fair and the special effects are pretty well done. my favorite parts are when the ships go under each other and other planets.
3,Pretty to look at...however...,"My first impression of this game was ""Wow. Gorgeous. Amazing."" In all fairness, this game is very nice to look at; all the ships look fantastic, as do the environments (although none of the ships are sized to scale; as a Borg fan, this bothered me a bit). However, there were a lot of problems...first of all, all the races are pretty similar in how they function...second, the game shipped with an absurd number of bugs (although there is a patch that fixes most of these now). The AI presents no challenge whatsoever, and the game gets very old very, very quickly. I cannot recommend this one for hardcore RTS fans...this game will be a breeze, and there really isn't anything 'new' here...you will tire of it quickly. The only people I can recommend this to are hardcore Star Trek fans, who will love the graphical interface (note that Multiplayer is actually pretty entertaining when you toss a couple more thinking opponents into the mix)."
3,Good but buggy...,"The game is excellent in every aspect, except that it IS FULL OF BUGS. It is very upsetting when you are playing for an hour or so and in the heat of battle, when suddenly the computer monitor flickers and your suddenly in windows. It's true and it happens a lot."
4,Does what I needed it for ....,"Finish is not bad, but is not a mirror-polish like say Snap-On or S-K would be.You aren't paying for S-K or Snap-On either, though.Functionality is top-notch."
1,Terrible. Just plain lousy.,"I love planes, documentaries, the Blue Angels, and with a DVD player and a home theater system, I was expecting at least to say, ""wow, that was cool"" to myself a couple of times. OK, maybe there were a couple of cool passes in mid-flight, but they got repeated about seventeen times, the synthesized music irritatingly makes you turn down the sound, and this is just about as cheesy as you can get. I might sell my copy if i can find anyone gullible enough, assuming i won't feel guilty about pawning it off on them..."
3,Its like a firworks show of Blue Angels,"If you like firework shows where you can sit back and ""oooh"" and ""ahhhh"" what you will see, then you will like this video/DVD. There is no narration, so you are free to fill in what you see with your own thoughts. This does give it a ""home movie"" effect, however, as if someone took their video camera and filmed the inside of the plane, the outside, and all kinds of different in flight angles. There are places where some narration would be helpful, as we have no idea what is going on in a briefing room. Watching this video will not give you any idea of the history, or what it takes to be a Blue Angel. You just sit back and watch, and watch, and watch. There is no sense of bringing this to a conclusion. If you like just blue angels without any background info, you will like this. You should get some background info, and this one falls short in this area."
5,"Sierra Hotel, Baby!","I felt like I was at a Blue Angel airshow! While there was no narrative, it was very easy to follow the action. Good, crisp shots of the FA18 Hornets doing their stuff! Will someone please do a similar DVD featuring the USAF Thunderbirds and their Lockheed Martin F16s?"
1,Not a bargain - thought we were getting the entire set from the picture,We thought we were getting the entire set from the picture and not just he rake. The value of this product for the price is terrible. Don't buy.
1,this game is from heck,"i hate this game, it is violent and they curse on it. its really bad. for all you parents who care about violence, don't get it."
4,I'm happy with my purchase,I'm so happy with my purchase. It came to me quickly and the product looked amazing. Thank you so much.
4,Vest/Tie Review,"Vest and tie showed up in perfect time for function and came in an envelope, thus the need for ironing which worked out just fine. Liked the back being black. Very thin, but perfect - may get a few wears out of it. Still less than renting from the tux shop."
2,Where's the rest of the gameplay,This was about the worse game I have brought on Amazon. It looked like this game was made for another platform and they just stripped all all of the options for the game to make it fix on a gamecube platform.Not pleased with this game.
5,Best Yu-gi-oh game yet!!,"This game is great you get to have three monsters and it all looks so cool in 3D!If you ask anyone how has played this game there say ""It's the best Yu-gi-oh game ever""!!!"
4,Starting to be dated---but still good,"ACS did a good job putting together a video that follows some basic laboratory safety principles. It is well organized and repeats information to make sure the students at least have some remembrance of the safety information. My favorite scene is where a hand is stabbed with a glass tube that is being inserted improperly. It always evokes a chuckle from the audience (that is awake).However the film is dated enough that ACS no longer supports it, the clothing is from my generation not the students that are watching it now, and a few of the recommendations are no longer valid (such as not wearing contacts in lab).From what I have searched there is no good replacement for this video that is so concise and broad in topics. So it is still worth showing but I dearly wish that ACS would produce a new version."
4,Good Game -a little tough for the younger ages,"Overall this game is fun and was a good buy. I do not want to rehash what the other reviewers have written, they are pretty much right on with their assessment. But I do have to say, this game is a little too much for younger kids. My little guy (age 4) loves the nintendo characters and he can handle most platform based games, so I picked him up this game based on the reviews I read, not realizing that the game has a RPG aspect to it. I actually thought I had bought him something else, but decided to give the game a chance based on the reviews. There are too many breaks in the action and too much reading involved to hold the younger audience."
5,Great writing!,David Buller clearly has the right touch of explaining things in an interesting way -- right from the first page!
3,Does not support Mac OSX 10.5 (Leopard),"Mac owners beware; Rosetta Stone has confirmed that this does not support Leopard and there are no updates available (they recommend buying the full version instead). Most of it works, however, you can't use regular Turkish keyboard entry or the modules that rate your pronunciation. Other than that it works reasonably well..."
1,too disappointing,This book reveals nothing new for those who have read her first book. There is no research; it all comes from Barone's own experience. There is no indication of the last time she was in France though it all has a dated feel. Give it a miss and check out Entre Nous: A Woman's Guide to Finding Her Inner French Girl by Debra Ollivier instead. Much better!
2,Quel désastre!,"Save your money, mes amies. Then spend it on something nice to wear (or eat).I will give you the key to success in every aspect of your life: be yourself. If you're not French, then MON DIEU do not slavishly eat/dress/whatever like them.As for weight loss, you already know what to do. Now go to it!"
4,Million Dollar Baby - soundtrack,"The simple, haunting melody of the recurring theme (It's Nice Viewing) reveals another facet of whom we know best as Dirty Harry - composer.If you enjoyed the movie, having the soundtrack is a must."
2,Legions Bow To a Faceless God,"As Hope Dies stumbles into the ground w/ this release. Personally, I'd never heard of the band before I'd seen them here. After reading the reviews, I decided to give them a shot. Good production, good artwork, decent lyrics, but no originality musicwise. To me, they sound like a knockoff of Darkest Hour or As I Lay Dying, which in fact, play this genre of music w/ more originality. The lack of deviation in songwriting formula is what buries this CD in mediocrity. If that is what you're looking for in your music, you'll definitely find it here."
3,Intended for the novice,"If you have any automotive knowledge and experience beyond the novice level, this book is not for you. The book is not a bad reference guide, but is more a list of recommendations than a how-to book. The layout and the photography is well done, but the pictures for the too few how-to articles tend to be more before-after than a detailed step-by-step format, which would be a welcome addition. Most experienced owners that have modified or are in the process of modifying their Mustangs are not going to find any new tricks here."
2,"good ideas , not explainig how to do it","the book have full of ideas how to improve your mustang, but do not explain how to do it, more for the expert mechanic and not for home mechanic."
5,Great value for young Thomas fans!,"My son got this toy for a Christmas present when he was 18 months old. At first, as a late walker, he was content to just push it around the house. He is a little over three now, and he likes to pretend it is a lawn mower, vacuum cleaner, etc. The handle is easy to detach and he also pretends to use it in various ways. The toy plays a short, happy, and fairly quiet ""Thomas"" melody when pushed, but it's not necessary for fun - our batteries gave out a while ago and we haven't replaced them, but our son is still interested in this toy."
5,K&N 33-2342 for Honda Civic,"excelent on cold starts, you can feel the engine response and the gas you save on long trips. a more powerfull tone of the engine on high rpms nothing exagerated. i will recomend this to anyone."
2,box labeled 33-2342,"I used amazons car search for desired part for order and I ordered it....recv'd box and it says 33-2342-- K&N;'s website says same number, BUT when I recv'd the filter it didn't look like the picture on either website (K&N; or Amazon). I found 2 of these filters on amazons site...ASIN: B000FQ0W1G -is what I am returning because it didn't fit on my 2010 honda civic-its rectangle in shape.ASIN: B005V08EMU -I am going to try and buy this one next.This should work.I noticed on amazons site that there are 2 sections of filters...Performance Parts & Accessories > Filters > Air Filters & Accessories > Air Filters-(I ordered it from here)orReplacement Parts > Filters > Air Filters & Accessories > Air FiltersI think amazons has either the site or pulling bin messed up."
2,Not to happy with the GAS MILEAGE~!,"I saw so many good reviews on K & N filter so decided to buy it for myself. I've had it for a month now and experienced a huge drop on my gas mileage. I usually get 370-380 miles with a full tank which is close to 12 gallons. Now, I only get 330-340 miles out of my full tank. I can honestly say that I feel little more power than before but it is not really worth it losing gas mileage. I'm going back to OEM filter. Hope this review helps!"
5,Great Book!,I am a long time fan of Harry Wong. This book is great especially for new teachers. Another great inspiratonal book with lots of practical ideas for teachers at all levels is Keeping the Light in Your Eyes.
3,"not bad, but often not to the point","There's really a lot to be said for this book, but it's really targeted at the young beginner, and much of its advice is pretty common-sensical. Much time is spent on issues like making a good first impression, wearing nice clothes, creating a daily routine, and so on---these, to me, are no-brainers I didn't need a book for. The format is a little heavy, too (pictures, pullout charts, and sidebars), leading me to think it's intended for an audience with a short attention span. (I fear for the new teacher with a short attention span!)However, the book continues with really solid classroom management advice, if you can wade through the mire."
2,Disappointing,"As a high school teacher, I found this book useless. The only useful thing about it are suggestions for rules. Clearly this was written for the primary grades."
4,came right on time,"easy breezy no problems, good condition. I mandatory read for class but its not half bad"
5,First Days of School,The book was entirely satisfactory in giving the procedures and approaches a classroom teacher should take. Even experienced teachers will benefit immensely. The layout is friendly making the contents digestible. Above all the positive messages are inspiring for all teachers and will renew their commitment to their profession.
5,Awesome!,"I began this school year very concerned about what I would and would not be learning to prepare for my practicum next year, this book helped to fill in many of the gaps and answered many of my questions."
5,A must read for ALL teachers,"This is the most useful teaching resource I've ever bought. I read EVERY WORD from cover to cover in two days. Every idea the Wongs wrote about (from classroom management to writing lesson plans) makes sense, and I can't wait to test them out when school starts next month. The central message in the book is how to evolve to the stage of teaching (Impact) that has the most benefit for you as well as the students. The Wongs write about the first days of school being the most critical in setting classroom management standards and daily work procedures."
4,"Review of ""The First Days of School""",This book has some excellent ideas for getting your school year started right. Even if you are not a new teacher this book is beneficial. As Harry Wong says you do not need to read the book from cover to cover to benefit. Since we all are so busy this is an awesome guide for those little problems you may be having in your classroom.
4,Great Resource!,"I bought this book for my student teacher because I have been using it as a resource in my classroom for eight years. Many of the ideas from Wong are great for classroom management and have helped me to save time, energy, and frustration. I actually reread it each summer before a new year begins to refresh my classroom management techniques and add new ones. It is great for new teachers who don't know what to do to begin the year, or veteran teachers who need a boost!"
5,Just get it!,This is my new bible of teaching. As a new teacher I was so worried about my first day and first few weeks of school. Thank goodness for Dr and Mrs Wang! I refer back to it all the time and have used so much from it. This is a book every teacher should have.
5,The First Days of School,This book is a great resource for first year teachers or those preparing to begin teaching. It answers all the questions you have about the first days and weeks of school that most first year teachers are not prepared for. I recommend this book to all those considering to teach.
2,More of a scold than being helpful,"This book is required reading for my pre-service training. I found it frustrating and irritating. First, Dr. Wong tells you that as a new teacher, you're going to make mistakes, and your mistakes will cause problems. Then he explains that if you stop making mistakes, you'll stop having problems.No argument here, but most teachers are not Dr. Wong, and mistakes will happen in spite of the most dilligent application of his advice. This book would have been significantly more helpful if it discussed how to monitor your performance and stop making mistakes."
3,Harry Wong Book,"The product came in good condition, but it took a little longer than I had expected because of weather issues. I do not fault the sender, but it was a little hard to track to see where it was. I would order from this person again."
4,disorganized,"there's a lot of really good information in this book, and its super helpful, i would seriously suggest that any future (or current even) teacher buy it & keep it nearby. BUT, the formatting of the book is like.... a schizophrenic wrote it! its all over the place, its hard to figure out where the really important info is. kinda strange. but still good!"
1,Entirely the Wong Way to Educate,"Gosh, I'd hate to be a student in a Wong classroom. Wong's book is an endeavor in positivistic manipulation, a recipe guide aimed at reproducing good little consumers who never question the authority figures in the Foucauldian nightmare world Wong and his fellow behaviorists have conjured. What Wong does not seem to realize is the children he obviously sees as objects in need of control and manipulation are going to be adults with little capacity for critical thought and decision making after 13 years of suffocation in any school under the thrall of the Wong way. Add the fact that the ""practical"" tips in the book are completely useless in 99 percent of the public school classrooms, and the Wong book is not only a waste of money, but a real danger to students subject to teachers sucked in by Wong's platitudes."
2,Baloney,The rumor is that Harry Wong said something along the lines that his methods and ideas don't work in the inner city. I certainly don't think they do.
5,Motivating!!!,"This book is great for both new and experienced teachers alike!! Harry Wong's enthusiasm is infectious and he inspires you to remember why you dedicated your life to this priceless service. His goal is for every child to be touched by a wonderfully effective teacher and for all teachers to strive to be a teacher with a capital ""T""."
1,At least make it after the card game,"This game has to be one of the worst games I've ever played. I was very surprised when I say on a top list here. The game completely gets rid of the regular duel system for a whole this type beats this type set up. I recommend World Tournament, or WWE instead.The stick:You start off with a deck with cards that have attack powers of 500 or so. Most effects are taken from the cards. You have duelist points which both limit the power of cards you can use and how many cards you can have in the deck. The battle system is just as crummy and the deck setup. You can play 1 monster card a turn You can't activate it's effect if it managed to keep it and attack in the same turn. I'm pretty sure exodia doesn't work in this, so sorry for all those exodia deck masters. So throughout the whole game you are trying to get rare and powerful cards that you can't use and try to beat some guys that have cards with 1000 more attack points than yours."
4,"ABSOLUTELY NEVER, EVER, EVER, EVER BUY.",I cannot explain enough how much I hate this game. DO NOT BUY.
4,Probably the best yet,"Wow this game really exceded my expectations.The problems most listed in other reviews say, it doesnt follow every rule in the actual card game, which is true,but the gameplay makes that up.Its A very good RPG, and nice graphics.You do get sucky cards, but I got through half the game with the same cards you get in the beggining.Its so easy at first, but all of the sudden, it will get tough!!!My only complaints, are the duelist level; and capacity, which makes the game a nice challenge at times.I was addicted to this game (I played it three hours straight)and you can get far pretty easily.If you are a Yu-Gi-Oh fan,you will find this a great game.If you want a real challenge from the beggining, get world tournement 2004(but has no story)I still recommend this one though, but the choice is yours..."
4,This is the best,Unlike the other Yu-Gi-Oh games in this game you can actually walk around. There is a card shop to buy cards and put in cheats. This is the best game ever. When i got this game i excpected it to be good but it is fanominal. You get to verse like 100 duelists including main characters like Yugi and Kaiba. You get two out of the three Egypyian god cards the last one you get but don't get to fight with it. Another bad point is you can't get too powerful cards in the the beginning and it is a short game but it is very fun. I would get this game if I were you because it is probaly the best game ever made. Also you get to do all the moments that were in the episodes. Remember this is the best game ever.
1,Another Dungeon Dice Monsters...,"When people see this game, the initial response is ""God cards! About time!"", thinking that ""Hey, they finally took away that stupid rule"". Nope, turns out they took away next to ALL the rules. If you're an actual Yu-gi-oh fan, then don't waste your money. The new rules, like maximum of 5 cards...and elemental instant kills will anger you. If you only like the show, then go for it. I beat this game in 1 and a half hours, so it won't last that long. Especially since it has no multiplayer options. Best advice: Skip it, and get Worldwide edition."
3,Well ths game is to well it stinks I wonder if kazuki knows,This is just bad well sure its an RPG AND SURE YOU GET THE GOD CARDS. Don't be stupid you don't even get those till close to the end of the game. Need I remind you effect cards have no effect. I remenber I was playing it and well I had a blue eyes on the field all of a sudden a weather report killed it why this happened is all about elements this game a pathetic. DUEL MONSTERS 8!!!! IS YUGIOH'S LAST HOPE IF IT FAILS WILL I PLAYED THAT ALREADY. It not battle city this time. good this cause they already did the dumb card map thing in sacred cards. Don't buy rent this game or you could be like the dumb kids and just waste $30.00 its your choice.
2,Why have the rules changed?,"You know why I bought this game? You got it, I did because I wanted to use cards like injection fairy lily (lod-100), yata-garasu (lod-000), etc., those very cool cards of the real game, in the gameboy advance. Unfortunately, rules are now new and very confusing (I don't understand why Konami did this). In this sense the previous game, the eternal duelist, is by far superior. Another good point of this latter game (world wide edition) is that kids that can not read english (yet) from different countries can use it! It is true that Sacred Cards have better and animated grafics but..."
5,Differential Equations,This is an awesome book. Easy to read and follow. It was exactly as described and was shipped quickly.
2,Smoke but no Flame,"For all the hype this game has received, there is nothing special about the game. While the graphics are excellent, the story is rather dull and the gameplay quite easy, even on the most difficult setting. You may have to repeat a mission two or three times, but no more than this, and you'll have finished all levels within a week (or a few days if you spend much time on the computer playing games). There is very little to think about when playing this game except whether you can gun down your enemies, which will disappoint those interested in exercising their wits as well as their trigger finger. With the Quake engine and the possible storylines, this game could have been something. Once again, Star Trek fans will have to wait for decent action game worthy of the name Star Trek."
2,Great Game but storyline and multiplayer are weak.,I first bought this game because the demo was great. And I loved the game until the very end of the story line in which I was suprised at the shortness of the single player. The Holomatch portion of the game is very dull with there being hardly any point. Multiplayer consists of who shoots who first. I have to say that I was very dissapointed
5,Love it when they put my favorite LP albums on CD,"This is another CD version of an LP album put out several years ago, and I am sure glad they picked this one so I can stop trying to put a needle through my old LP. Doc Watson and his Gallagher guitar are simply awesome--the prototype folk guitar, both flat and fingerpicking style, supported superbly by Merle Watson. The audience is knowledgeable and appreciative, and their reactions augment the enjoyable music a lot. This is another album that you should just sit and do nothing but listen to. Close your eyes and imagine you are at the concert."
1,Not their best.,"With fresh recollections of the 25th Anniversary video and the Lifelines - Live video in my mind for comparison; this video falls short. It seems to promise ""something"" that it never delivers. Many of the best performances on this DVD are interupted by voice overs. Peter, Paul, & Mary seem more angry for less reason on this DVD. I would have preferred seeing their beginnings explored a little more thoroughly, and more complete b&w concert footage included. Their early concert performances are barely touched upon. More focus is given to their treasonous acts against the United States, than to the music that they did so well together. For me, this DVD is way too wordy. Their music speaks for itself, when it is permitted to do so, which is very rarely done on this DVD. A great disappointment."
5,direct remake and a darn good one at that!!,"great game,not exactly different from the first,but still really good.nice graphics and a SOLID storyline(get it?)"
5,Metal Gear Solid: The Twin Snakes,"The Metal Gear series rules, it is the coolest series ever. The gamecube is the best system Konami could choose it for, I mean, hey, X-Box got the upgraded version of MGS:Sons Of Liberty, more commonly known as Substance. I know that the PS2 also got an identical version of the game but this is where Konami started broadening their horizons. Why can't a different system get the upgraded version of the original Metal Gear Solid. Granted both games originated on the PS console, but hey, why can't there be more of a variety, freedom of choice. This is only the tip of the berg I'm afraid. The same thing will happen, maybe not with the Metal Gear series, but with other series as better more advanced systems are introduced. By the way, Gamecube and PS2 ROCK!!"
4,never as good as the original.,"I enjoyed the new hyped up graphics that the original didn't have, but I've played the original so many times it's not even funny. What I don't like is it's not as epic as the first MGS on the playstation. The emotional moments don't capture someone as well as the first, the dialogue sounds like the voice actors were all hung over and didn't want to come to work that day, and the music blows. I would recommend this game IF AND ONLY IF, you've played the original!! I'll give it 4 stars instead of 3 just to be fair. I'm too hardcore of a metal gear fan to give it any less."
4,Good AutoFocus for a great price,"I have been a satisfied Minolta camera user since 17 years. I had bought this camera for about $50 and then used it for 3 years after which I lost it. Every indoor/outdoor picture that I had taken with it was good. For twenty bucks, this is an excellent valued camera with good features."
4,Hard to find movie,I was very happy with this as it is a difficult movie to come across in stores. It was a nice bonus to have an additional movie included and the price was quite reasonable.
1,"Boring and unfunny, except for the Sid Caesar selection","I suspect that the other review, from ""A Customer"" is really from the producer, because the ""review"" is just a repeat of the product description. My review: this is a poor and unfunny collection of boring and unfunny odds and ends that somebody found - it's not great comedy by any means, and doesn't show the comedians at their best, except for the Sid Caesar and Imogen Coca selection - that one is very funny. The selection with Lucille Ball is just a commercial she did with the other cast members - a commercial for Westinghouse. Not funny at all.I'm saving this video only for the good Sid Caesar sketch. (The Jackie Gleason sketch is unbelievably bad - and it's not from ""The Honeymooners."")"
5,simply great,This tape was great it features great cartoons that I think were simply great.Simple simon is a classic. It is great because kids can see cartoon classics and watch how simple simon gets in simple trouble.
5,Great sound / reasonable price,This replaced a blown woofer in my stereo system. Works perfectly and the system sounds better than when originally purchased.
3,Wash your mouth out with soap!,"While this book is fairly well laid out and the content is helpful, be forewarned that this book contains profanity that I found offensive. I bought this book to help me communicate with my newly-adopted teenage daughter from China. I never expected to see the sh- word or the fu- word in a translation book. Who really needs to know how to curse in Chinese? Sheesh.Just know what you're getting when you buy this."
2,"Great ideas, but a bit dull...","...well, like all Robert Holdstock's books this has some twisted and dreamlike ideas, and you can't really understand what happens until the very end, when you have seen the light.It is a must-read for all true Robert Holdstock fans, even though it is far from his best work, since it is written in a rather dull way.It was originally called the Fetch, which is a more proper title to my eyes, but what do I have to say about such things :)Enjoy it."
2,almost good,"the first documentary which is the feature, i might add, is crap. there is nothing new or amazing, or any secrets for that matter, nothing, skip[ past this feature. sad, sad.the game on disc one is even dumber. when will realize that grown ups and most kids dont play dvd games, they play real video games, and the reward is a 15 second clip of nothing, and after you unlock it, it doesnt stay unlocked! play the whole thing for no reward, no thanks.the third feature on the first disc is the only real reason to purchase this dvd, it is beautiful, in color, and a portrait of 1955 (1956) disneyland. this is a gem!!!!!!the second disc, had some good things on it.the opening day doc was fun, and time lapse was amazing, but two of the features looked like CRAP on my player. i have disney asddressing this. anyone else have the problem on disc 2?"
3,"Walt Disney Treasures - Disneyland: Secrets, Stories, Magic","This is a great DVD set for the die-hard Disney fan. It shows footage of the beginnings of Disneyland: when it was built, how it was built, and the warm reception it received from the public. This is a must-have for the die-hard Disney fan or historian but may not be exciting enough for a general Disney enthusiast. I especially loved the aerial footage over the park while it was being built and during its time of operation. Coverage of Disneyland over the rest of the 50 years is very fulfilling, but it does skip over some of the years. This is a great addition to my Walt Disney Treasures DVD tin collection."
5,Good stuff!,"I will make this short and sweet. It was a real encouragement to watch this movie as it was motivating to love others, forgive, and be a witness for the Lord."
5,SPECTACULAR MOVIE >>>A MUST SEE BY ALL AND ALL AGES,AMAZING movie...the movie is set in the 1970's about 3 boys and their lifes in a small town. Very intrieging movie with just a good wholesome story about life and a special friendship with a christian man and his testimony he has for the Lord. A MUST see for all christians and their families of all ages..ANYONE and EVERYONE should see this movie.THe plan of salvation is clearly seen. A HEART TO HEART MOVIE>> YOU WON't BE DISAPPOINTED>>>very refreshing to have a movie made and shown in the USA in 2010 what a blessing!!!!!!!!!!!
3,Average fare - questionable Christianity,"This movie tries too hard to be a ""perfect"" Christian movie. Some of the values are good, but some are overly simplistic. Sperry telling Dustin that the bully must have a hard time in life without a father, while not acknowledging Dustin's lack of a father - rather blew me away. Also the Bible is quite clear there is a time to fight (Proverbs, David & Goliath, ect...). Some of the situations are awkward and unrealistic - Dustin and the girl he likes - it turns into a witnessing thing instead of what could have been a *Godly* friendship (it is normal for a boy to ask a girl out)! Lastly, the rosy ending where all the kids turn into Christian doctors, lawyers, biologists, astronauts, ect...just killed it for me. Facing the Giants and Fireproof are better Christian movies that show Christianity in a better and more realistic manner."
4,Great Game...just a little short of excellent!!!,"I'm a great fan of monster/vampire games and this game does not dissapoint me in the least!!! It is a great game. There are only 3 things that would make this an excellent game. 1-The camera angles can be a bit tricky, and at some points in the game, downright hurtfull. 2-It's my sincere belief that 2 controls for the item screen are not necessary, right stick would be better used as a camera control or better yet, not at all. 3-The intro to the story is not bad at all, but during the game I expected more answers and non-player character development."
4,my Castlevania:L of I review,"Castlevania was good compared to Symphony of the Night. I thought that the game was awesome but there were some things that made me mad. Like the camera angles, which were annoying to see some enemies, the game was short I beat this game in 13 hours of game play, and the hair on Leon was metrosexual. The music was awesome, the game play was very good, the plot was interesting, the foes deaths were cool. If you are a true Castlevania lover like me then you will at least this game a chance."
4,Stress Release,"There is a great deal about graphics , game play, and max up's. The fact that after a stress filled day you can come home and pick up a paddle and go for broke. The whole whip thing is awesome.The puzzle is what grabbed my attention. It is filled with one puzzle after another. I found the game to be a short one, but nonetheless an enjoyable game to waste time with.I am no professional on graphics, but I found it easy to follow. The only thing I am professional at is having fun and button mashing! Just grab the game and enjoy it is well worth the price. The storyline is great as well."
5,Great Movie!,"I used to love the Leslie anne warren version when I was younger and I recently bought this one and it is 100x better. This is coming from a 18 year old girl who HATES black and white movies and has never sat through one (Even ""its a wonderful life"" did not have enough appeal to make up for no color.) I went back and watched the warren version after I saw this one and it is laugable in my opinion. All the pretty costumes and bright colors can not make up for the poor acting and second rate singing. This Julie Andrews version is AMAZING and I highly recommend it!"
4,Cinderella,"For a black and white tv production this is the best quality you are going to get. The movie itself was very enjoyable, although the kids prefer the color version."
4,good product,The instruction are SO-SO. Once I got it combined with my scope.....Just what I needed.... not too short and I can adjust it to where I need it...GOOD BUY
5,A Brilliant Live DVD,"Performing songs from The Fourth Legacy, Karma, Epica and The Black Halo, this is a the best way to see Kamelot on a screen to date."
1,How could anybody do this to such a legend?,"B.B. King is a blues legend. He is ranked #3 on Rolling Stone's list for the 'Top 100 Greatest Guitarists of All-Time,' and rightfully so. He and his ""partner,"" his guitar Lucille, gave us some of the best music of all-time.And why Madacy bootlegged B.B.'s live songs and made a two-CD set out of them is beyond me. I love bootlegs. I collect bootlegs. And I usually don't mind them. But the sound quality on these are all muddled and sound terrible. Madacy made no effort whatsoever to clean these up.Overall, if you want live B.B. King, than check out 'Live At The Regal' or 'Live At San Quentin.' But just ignore this collection.Not recommended."
4,Not for newer vehicles,"I ordered these to pass out to co-workers during our passionately pink event. I did not even think that most newer cars don't have the type of antennea to support these. I was bummed, but for those that had older vehicles they are great!"
2,Disappointed,"I love Tyler Perry's play but I this wasn't as entertaing as the rest of his plays. I know theres probably two versions and I hope the second is better. On ""Class Reunion"", Tyler said that this taping had alot drama. This probably is why he didn't put out such a good product. If you haven't seen any of his plays my suggestion see Class Reunion, I can do bad by myself, or The Browns."
3,could have been better,"This game could have been so much better if they'd spent a little more time getting the bugs out. I am a white wolf junkie so I love the game on principle but it was too ""hack & slah"" to be a good rpg. There needed to be more plot developement."
4,Vampires rule.,"Vampire the The Masquerade Redemption is a stuning graphical and musical representation of a dark world. The story and character creation is fun to do because of the different magical blood powers you can develop over time. I like the game better in the old world than the new world because I prefer the sword fighting to any modern wepon I have found. The story line is linear and as much as I have tried most of the plot points are unchangeable; however, the sound and graphics alone are reason enough to buy the game. Plus Vampires and the gothic world of dark depravity are a blast to explore. This game is a game I would buy again, so I would recommend it to any gamer who enjoys dark story lines, interesting music, and appreciates great animated gaming."
2,too many problems with online multiplayer(DON'T WORK),"The game is fine if you just want to play single player or over a LAN. Online multiplayer apparently is no longer supported in any form or manner. Activision does not even give answers to problems with online either. The official activision website for this game; The links do not work. The game has been abandoned by the manufacturer, developers and everyone it seems. Save your money and don't support activision. Don't buy this game if you could ever possibly want to play it online with friends. Cuz you can't."
1,Vampire: The Masquerade Redemption,"Overall: Not ImpressedGood:Pretty GraphicsOk StoryBad:Saving while playing the game not pratical, but can be overcomeSpells are completley useless in battle (there was no time to casts spell other then an occasional heal spell)Group Problems:- There is no control over your group in battle- Group constantly geting stuck behind walls and other objects- Group wastes ammo and mana- Group would constantly get themselves killed by charging into large groups of creatures- I was eventually forced to leave group at zone entrance and solo the zone, calling on the group only when neededBasically a hack at it until it dies gameVery abrubt ending"
2,"Great game, too bad for the bugs.","Vampire:The Masquerade Redemtion is a good game. If you take away the bad AI (Artificial Intelligence), bad pathfinding, and horrid gameplay. The multiplayer can be fun. But it seems alot of players have trouble with thier character getting deleted for no reason. Very few people play this on-line, and even fewer can offer you good Dungeon Master run quests. There are only two quests you can do without a player Dungeon Master.. and those get old very very fast. Anyhow, to keep my review short, I will just say if your a big fan of White Wolf and Vampires then this is your game. If not, then I wouldn't recommend it."
1,Yawn,"If you are looking for the fiery songs we all hear on Saturdays throughout the fall, keep looking. The song selection also dates this album. Many of today's power houses are excluded in favor of those who saw their days of glory before my lifetime. It is also insulting to see the Iowa Fight Song credited to Iowa State."
2,"Well Played, But Not What I Was Looking For","The University of Michigan band plays these 41 songs very well. However, the style is not what I was looking for. I wanted to hear the fight songs the way I would hear them on Saturday afternoon at the stadium. Instead, they play the music way I would hear it at the end-of-the-year sit-down concert in the auditorium. Even with their own ""The Victors"" fight song. Not the CD I would play to get pumped up for the big game. If you're looking for the marching band type of sound, try ""Touchdown!"" by Florida State's band. It's available here on Amazon.com."
4,Highly recommended,"I've had this game for 9 months, and I play it on and off. It's an extremly fun way to get exersize, and to learn how to have rythme while you dance. The music choices are fine, but not spectaular. If you are still plannig this after 6 months, I would upgrade to the $99 dance pad or better because it make a big differance."
5,FREAKS OF THE WORLD... UNITE!,"This game is gonna rule. Ive been playin for... o... about 1 1/2 years and I am an expert player. This game is gonna be sweet because new songs, new challenges, and yes dirty vegas and kylie minogue are gonna be in it. Time to play DDR and not waste coins!!!"
4,Dance all night long!,"Seriously this game is awesome, it's so fun, as soon as I got it I was dancing the day away from like 6pm to 2am I'm not even joking bout that, It's got songs you earn w/ how many points you get for each song played, They're are really cool songs and really tacky annoting ones like In the Navy, beware of that one, only 4 the tone deaf, you can choose different difficulties 4 each song, and chaos meter etc. anyways, u gotta buy it you'll absolutely love it."
5,Fun and it's great exercise!,"This game is great for my kids! Not only is it fun, it's great exercise! I constantly worry about my kids getting enough exercise, and this game incorporates their love of video games and it satisfies my want for them to remain physically active. I read an article on a website called associated content, that praised this game and cited the growing problem of teen health. The TV,internet and all the other technology that keeps our kids sitting and staring at a screen is taking over! Dance Dance Revolution is a great way to combat it, and it's a great family game too! Dance Dance Revolution is wonderful!"
5,Loving DDRmax2,"I just got this game for Christmas and i enjoy playing it so much. It keeps you moving around, and it's a great workout too! Especially on workout mode. It's great to be able to play such a fun arcade game, right in the comfort of your home. I also like using the dance pads more than a controller because it gives you a challenge!To anyone who likes to move around and dance, i recomend this game with two thumbs up!"
5,"A wonderful, rolicking story for the very young.","Simple, repetitive, and catchy - my one year old loves this book. With anticipation she waits for the end and joins in for the final ""mama, mama, I went to town, inside, outside, upside down!"""
3,"Book was just ""okay""","My son was intrigued with this book...and was interested with it for the first half of the book...and then got bored and struggled to sit through the rest of it. It perhaps had to do with the fact that there are less than 10 words in the entire book. Even when reading slowly, it was hard to not fall asleep myself..."
2,Not so great,I bought to replace the filter that came with the humidifier. It did not perform as well as the original one. I was disappointed. I clean the filter per the instructions but this one got very gross quickly and had a funny smell about it. I really like the humidifier and I think there is a filter by Hunter that is more expensive but I will buy it next time.
5,Did not need this,Thought the filter needed replacing but the new one looks just like the old one. No problem with filter or service. Just did not need to order it. Will keep for future use.
3,album price is more than double cost of buying songs separately,"Hmm... as of 3/28/11, there are 5 songs on this album ($0.99 each, or $4.95 total), or you can buy the whole album for $9.99. That means for the convenience of buying an album, you'll pay double plus 9 cents. I think I'll bite the bullet and deal with those extra 4 clicks. Or maybe just 3 since I don't love ALL the songs ;)"
4,Weird Magic,"I've been frustrated for a while in trying to find a book recounting Irish tales that lives up to the weird magic of its source material. Here it is at last. The book effortlessly captures the deep Christianity and deeper magic of the best Irish stories. And the language is perfect--it's hard to believe this book is less than ten years old. It might be pushing a thousand. And yet it's as readable as a bedtime story. If you liked the Tain, you'll like this. If you liked Froud's Fairies, you'll like this. If--like me--you liked both, you'll be in heaven."
4,Good,"A little different from other Stones' album from that time. However, very good. I like the lighter feel, the happier side so to say. Love the version of My Girl (The Temptations)."
3,Flowers,"Actually, that fellow got it wrong: ""Mother's Little Helper"" is stereo on ""Aftermath UK"" and mono on ""Flowers."""
2,Not that great of an introduction,"This book is very biased against postmodernist thought and already assumes that you know who the prime movers and shakers of postmodernism are. If I hadn't already read the ""Teach Yourself"" version, I would have no idea what this author is talking about. Despite the author's bias--he really thinks postermodernism is complete crap and lumps all postmodernist authors/artists together--the book is still a decent read. If you aren't already familiar with Derrida, Baudrillard, Foucault, etc., etc., then this book will most likely confuse you."
5,Critical Theory,"I was pleased to find that Prof. Butler discusses ""post-modernist"" theory critically and with intellectual rigor. I was concerned that this short introduction would be either a hymn to post-modernist theory or an uncritical recitation of post-modernist ideas. Instead, Prof. Butler analyzes and criticizes the sources, substance and implications of various post-modernist methodologies -- deconstruction, Foucaultian analysis, post-colonialism -- as these have been embraced, partially-embraced, and adapted in literature, the visual arts, architecture and popular culture. The reader learns alot about post-modernist theory, but from a critic who is skeptical as well as informed. Would the ""episteme"" have ""replicated"" his example."
5,Exactly what I needed - thanks!,"We have 3 indoor cats and lot of windows. I ordered 3 perches and just ordered a 4th. This is exactly what we needed. Our windows do not have a sill, but we were able to make quick modifications using sturdy wood screws and our 16, 15 and 12 lb. cats are delighted. Thank you."
2,"Good pictures, but not much else","I bought this book after I'd been here for a couple of months. Luckily, I already had the Lonely Planet's Guide to Greenland, Iceland and the Faroe Islands. The Landmark Guide has good pictures, but not much else. I'd only recommend it if you already have the Lonely Planet Guide and some experience with the island. It will not help you find a good hotel or good restaurant, and for some reasons skips a lot of the good places to see. A big disappointment."
5,Excellent,"My husband had Latin in college and is interested in teaching it to our son. He researched a lot of products, purchased this one, and is extremely happy with his decision. He goes through the lessons on our computer and our two year old son likes to sit on his lap and join in repeating the vocabulary words. It's an excellent program."
3,HARD-TO-FIND BOOK WITH A HARD TO FIND SUBJECT.,"After Finding a copy of this book at a bargain book store, I realized that Mr. Caidin was trying to make a point that some things we call Supernatural are only natural subjects if viewed from different points of ""view"" and looked at commonly, as if what we view as supernatural has happened everyday. Sometimes he makes his point in prescribing supernatural happenings as being normal,but disappointingly,He misses the mark most of the time. It seems as if he read another book on supernatural happenings and he was trying to convince somebody (himself?)that these are normal happenings of nature. As much as we would like to believe that, This book will only convince someone that already agrees that the supernatural is really a natural occurrance we may have overlooked (like Myself)."
3,Beautiful Images but...,"Dita looked great in the images, as she always does. Personally I appreciated the autobiographic aspects of the book as well, as alot of her take home message is that any woman from moderate beginnings can become a glamour puss vixen. I think however, in her efforts to rehash the history of Burlesque, she missed quite a few of the more fringe performers throughout the ages, which was unfortunate. Perhaps in an effort to keep her content more high brow, I suppose.I would have loved a deeper exploration of the relationship between herself and other performers, as that would help this book seem less one dimensional. Definitely a great book for a fan, but not a good Burly 101 book, not by a long shot."
1,TRASH!!!,"THIS BOOK IS COMPLETELY EXAGGERATED!IT'S ALL ONE BIG ACT.THE WAY IT'S WRITTEN IS LIKE A REHEARSAL OF SOME KIND.IT'S TOTALLY STUPID!I NEVER SEEN A BOOK WRITTEN THIS POOR BEFORE!IT'S A WASTE OF MONEY.I THREW MINE OUT BECAUSE IT WASN'T WORTH KEEPING.I'M SORRY I THREW MY MONEY AWAY ON IT!THIS PRODUCT IS TRYING TO BE SOMETHING IT'S NOT,AND WILL NEVER BE!THE REAL TRUTH OF THIS BOOK IS BETTY GRABLE AND BETTIE PAGE!"
4,A Short Note on Grammar,"It's not ""la cosa nostra"". That translates to ""the our thing"". It's simply ""cosa nostra"". Or as Paulie Walnuts called it ""this thing of ours"". Capisce?"
4,glue on the discs,"There was glue on the discs when I took them out of the folders. The discs slid down in between the creases where they're glued and it got glue around the edge and on the side where the player reads the disc. I managed to clean all the glue off but it was very difficult. I suggest packaging these discs differently, like in thin jewel cases?..."
1,defective item,"Several DVD's in this set were defective, did not work. I missed a lot of episodes. VERY VERY disappointed with this item and with this seller. Contacted seller twice with no response. Would not order anything from him again. I paid good money for a defective item I plan on throwing away. Can't watch the episodes that don't work and certainly wouldn't lend the set to anyone to watch. Wasted my money on this purchase! Beware of items from this seller !"
2,Poor quality product,"I have not even finished the second season and have had to borrow the separate seasons from a friend twice in order to watch the series so far. One of the discs was unreadable and another had issues playing one of the episodes. The law of averages tells me that I will probably have at least 4 more bad discs or episodes before I am through watching the series. I guess you get what you pay for. Do yourself a favor and find a better quality set if they make one. If not, buy the seasons separately."
1,oncshop is bad,"I recieved my soprano complete dvd set and it was bad.Contacted oncshop he send me more bad dvds.contacted oncshop many,many,many times and nothing.I buy alot of things on amazon never had any problems like this oncshop."
2,Bad Discs,"I was not able to play all the discs. Some did, some didn't. Quite a let down, but the seller made it right with me."
5,Great show,"I can't believe all the crying from people who bought the individual seasons, are you that stupid that you thought they wouldn't release the entire series with new extras? I already sold off my individual seasons and am looking forward to this release."
3,The Sopranos Complete Series,There was a few DVD's with scratches and we would have to skip some scenes. I have not yet completed the series. That disappointed us.
1,Do Not Buy This,"First of all, the packaging is horrible. Secondly, if you put the DVD in a computer, the title of the disc is ""New"" or ""Disc,"" which screams bootlegged. On discs where there are four episodes, when you try to play the third or fourth episode, you get repeats of the first two. Save your money and buy the real deal, this one is garbage."
3,Geography,"it is a hardcover book, which i perfered. i did not like that there were several chapters hightlighted."
2,Strung together and incohesive,"The story is extremely graphic, which is fine and might be enjoyable if there were some scenes other than sex scenes. While the book does TRY to have a plot -evil royals invading hedonistic Syria- the plot is thin at best. All the characters do is have sex. It quickly becomes a sometimes icky kink fest with nothing to separate scenes and make any kind of pacing.Where are the good Black Lace books I keep hearing about? I have only read one- Gothic BlueThe rest have been massive disappointments."
4,I Love XXXHolic!,"This collection isn't as good as one and two but it is good. I became interested in XXXHolic after receiving the first disk through the Amazon Vine program. I have read all the books so far and am a big fan! In this disk we have a girl who must face the fact she has been stringing a number of men around, Watanuki discovers why Domenki is actually good for him but wonders why it has to be him. Yuko continues to fix Watanuki as well."
4,Wonder woman bust bank,"Another cool bank from D.C. comics. It may not be a perfect sculpture and it may not be sexy enough for some people. But hey its a bank,still much cooler way to save your change than a pig!"
4,Best read in SF military,"An excellent storyline, equal to if not better than anything David Drake has put out. Hard hitting and believable in a way not found often enough. I wish the next volume would come out so I can dive into it."
2,Not as good as it could have been.,"The authors should have concentrated more on the mission, or more on the training than writing a little about each. Two books could have been written allowing for more character development, better background introduction, and less repetition of the character's thoughts and feelings. The story line was okay , but could have been much better with some careful writing."
3,Tierra del Fuego,This is a very knowledgeable and educational adventure. In this book Peter Lourie takes you on a ride of the region of Terria del Fuego. This book tells you of many wonderful islands with animals like Peguin Island and Seal Island. I think you should read this book to learn more and appreciate the beautiful pictures of the flowers and Islands.By: D.B.
4,Different but still pure Stones,"I understand this was the Stones first totally written by what was to become The Glimmer Twins (Mick & Keith) it is a different arrangement of songs to say the least. But they were just the start of some of the greatest songs written since the Beatles. Let's spend the night together, Ruby Tuesday,Connection & Miss Amanda Jones are classics. What I found to be very interesting was that the Cover has what appears to be a very STONED Brian Jones grinning from ear to ear with that stoner far away eyes look. I do remember reading excerpts from Keith's autobiography in Rolling Stones that Jones was getting high so often that he began to miss recording sessions with the group. We now know they all did there fair share of Drugs but Jones really took it to the limit and was later ask to leave the Group because of heavy Drug use.But what was to come later Let it Bleed & Beggars Banquet were master works"
5,Super book for NCLEX-RN,"I found this book is very interesting and useful. It give the view from another angle than Saunders Comprehensive Review by Silvestri. There is another grouping themes and it based on NCLEX-RN from April 2007. Question's stylistics another too. I purchased this book after book of Silvestri, and I hope that these two books will help me to pass exam NCLEX-RN in Israel on September 2008."
5,A great study tool.,"I bought this book because I was struggling with my adult comprehensive nursing class and had not passed the first 2 tests. I read the neuro system chapter, because that's what we were focusing on in class, and I received a B on my next test! This is a great book if you have an instructor who gives NCLEX style questions!"
4,Primeval Stones,"This is classic Stones before they assaulted us with garbage like SympathyFor The Devil, and, well, virtually anything after 1970."
4,4 1/2 stars.,"""Aftermath,"" was the stones first album of all original material, and it has a vibe that's a bit different from their previous recordings. Brian Jones plays a mean sitar on the great opening track, ""paint it, black,"" which is a classic piece of psychedelic rock. ""Lady Jane,"" is a divine acoustic ballad, with a heavy english folk sound about it (trivia bit: on neil young's masterpiece ""tonight's the night"" he sings a song about borrowing a tune from the rolling stones for one of his songs, because he's too wasted to come up with his own tune. The melody which he borrowed from the stones for that tune is the melody from ""Lady Jane.""). The blues, as always, are a big part of the stones sound. ""Doncha bother me,"" boasts a fine display of slide guitar wizardry, and ""High and Dry,"" is an excellent acoustic blues piece with a strong sense of melody. ""It's not easy,"" is another standout, with its splendid rhythmic drive. All in all, another fine outting from the stones which i highly recommend."
1,"Cartoon is painful, difficult and lame","The crayons are just fine.It's the additional cost for ""creating your own cartoon"" that warrants this product receiving a 1 star. The software is way too difficult for kids to use and my adult sister had trouble creating anything that had any likeness to anyone in our family. The choices are limited and the end result is nothing like you or your kids. Very unhappy with the result. For sure not worth the additional cost for this software. We made one cartoon, no one was happy with it and no one colored it, and we ended up never using the software again."
1,HOLY CRAP!!!! POO ON ACTIVISION,It would be better for activision to poop on a blank disk box it up and ship it out... But hey they're makin money I guess.
1,This is a very bad game,"The character you control moves so rigid. He fights slow too. That's the thing that kills the game. It'll take a long time to beat. When you jump you pause and long time so enemies can kill you. Then they have a time limit to beat a level, and that makes it worse. Don't buy the game!!"
3,OK Video for Peanuts Fans,"This is an adequate compendium of 2 Peanuts specials, each dealing with Charlie Brown needing sponsorship for his baseball team. CHARLIE BROWN'S ALL STARS scores in some of its animation, especially the action scenes with Snoopy surfing and the kids skateboarding. Also noteworthy is a good soundtrack by Vince Guaraldi-probably the main reason why this special was nominated for an Emmy. But the special is poorly edited and has some poor animation. IT'S SPRING TRAINING, CHARLIE BROWN, overall, is about as good as CHARLIE BROWN'S ALL STARS. It's well edited and scores in its funny, unexpected rap/dance scene led by Franklin. Some things about the story are not well explained, like where Charlie Brown knows new character Leland from. Worth your money if you were curious about these 2 specials as you probably don't remember them being broadcast."
4,More than I bargain for...,I bought this CD on the strength of one song I found on a free compilation. The song is called O.G.Bitch.... and it seemed to be a slap at artist Nelly Furtado.... so I wanted to see if this singer was a one hit wonder or someone with enough talent to carry a CD or just swipe at another performer. I was happy to find she has her own road and style. I love it when a singer has something to say and better yet I want to and enjoy hearing it...Good on you Esthero.... Now make more..
2,Boring and crappy,"I got this Cd because i fell in love with Estero's first CD, ""breath from another."" With the modern sound and feel of ""breath from another"" i was sure that this cd would be a good follow-up, especialy with a title as such. I was wrong!!!! Estero groans on the title track about how she is so sick and tired of hearing Ashanti and Britney on the radio, but instead of going back to her traditinal trip-hop roots, she dilivers songs that seem as though they should be played on pop stations along with Britney. I was so turned off that i vowed to never buy another Estero CD again, and i have kept that promise. I only gave it a two because there is one good trip-hop song at the end, which sounds as if it may be left over from ""breath from another."" However, i have only listened to this cd twice in the five or so years that i have owned it, so I can not even name that song."
1,"SACD version lacking, but still worthwhile","During the 2002 RUSH to re-release the Rolling Stones to SACD, abkco, london and DECCA failed on ""NOW."" The first track:""EVERYBODY NEEDS SOMEBODY TO LOVE"", was reduced to a 3 minute some seconds, rarely heard version, from the original abkco/London 420 in the plastic jewel case which offered a 5:04 'European'track,(from LK-4661, aka; Volume 2) vinyl Lp, as originally recorded by DECCA U.K., and SHOULD have been mono, to present The Rolling Stones 'their-way.' Suggest try to get the first release of NOW, in plastic jewel case. abkco could have done a much better release, in original mono, and a few Stereo tracks, mostly Stereo on After-Math, which seems to remain about ""the Best"" LP, CD, from the Fab-Five"
4,R & B Now,"The Rolling Stones, Now! is one of the most deeply rooted in R&B albums the Stones have ever done. Songs ranging from Chuck Berry Berry's ""You Can't Catch Me"" to Bo Diddley's ""Mona"" to Otis Redding's ""Pain In My Heart"", the band wears their R & B influences on their sleeves. ""Heart Of Stone"" is an excellent Jagger-Richards original and ""Little Red Rooster"" is tailor-made for Mr. Jagger's strutting persona. Now! is one of the least commercial albums the band has released, but they put their blood and guts into it."
2,A patchy collection of soul & blues covers,"Like the first two albums, NOW! is largely made up of blues and soul covers which seldom surpass the original versions. By early 1965 when this record hit the stores, this formula was starting to run dry and NOW! remains a less-than-convincing album.Bo Diddley's Mona, Chuck Berry's You Can't Catch Me and Solomon Burke's Everybody Needs Somebody To Love are the better interpretations. The best cover is Little Red Rooster, due to Brian Jones' brilliant slide guitar.The best Jagger-Richards number is easily Heart of Stone, a mid-tempo ""anti-love song"" that again features some fine slide from Mr. Jones.Beyond that, there isn't much to recommend this collection of songs, again limited to a measly 12 tracks. I'd rather listen to Otis Redding than the Stones sing soul. The album begs more original compositions which the Stones won't deliver until their next album."
1,Read this before ordering,Be aware that the Amazon description for this is incorrect. It is NOT for a Dana 35. It is actually for a Dana 30. The pinion yoke was Rugged Ridge brand and I looked up the part number on their website and it clearly states there that it is for Dana 30. I had my Jeep taken apart and only after that did I realize something wasn't right.
5,Beautiful crib set!,"This is a gorgeous crib set! It is exactly what we were wanting for our new son's room. If you are TIRED of the usual primary colors for boys - red, yellow, blue - then you will definitely love this set."
3,"50"" clamps for $23... ? I doubt it.","50"" clamps for $23, come on! I'll pay you $25 per clamp to tell me the site! I don't have any yet, but they look great at whatever price. ***After further 'review', in my excitement of such a great price, i did not notice the review in question was 5 years old. My apology. I will buy some soon, hope for a good sale."
3,Best clamps ever (revised),"These clamps are great. They dont flex under high loads, and they have a great measuring system built right into them. I would highly recomend them. However some of the clamps will become troublesome over time. They just dont slide very well. I've called Jet a few times and had new ones sent out free of charge a couple times. Great Customer Service by Jet."
2,Ello set,Overpriced by sellers at Christmas. I do not believe in holding parents and grandparents hostage at the holidays because children have their heart set on something. Nice toy. Too expensive when price is artificial.
2,Lizzy's review of Cognac fanny pack,"This fanny pack is attractive, but it was a little disappointing in what it would hold. The glasses pouch on the front does not accommodate a glass case. You can only carry the actual glasses and I prefer to keep my glasses in a case to avoid scratching. When I used this glasses pouch for anything else, it did not stay closed and I ended up dropping my car keys on the floor and someone picked them up, as I was not aware that they had dropped out of the pouch. For the price of this Fanny Pack, I would have expected more value."
1,not what I expected it to be,"the book is not what I expected it to be. it is a tiny dictionary, words in small font."
1,Diccinnario LaRousse Del Espanol Moderno,I expected to have a larger font and better quality paper. This was a poor edition for a resource text!
4,includes more words than most,"I have found this dictionary very helpful in reading Spanish -- it includes many words I cant find in my Spanish English dictionaries. Admittedly the paper and binding are not going to standup to the kind of use Im giving it, but then I can replace it cheaply."
1,too little information - TOO MUCH PREACHING,"This book is great for those who like to be told ""exactly"" what the think, believe and do. For those of us seeking a more spiritual communion with the divine, pass this book up. There is a lot of information in here, but for my personal brand of spirituality, it comes across as too ""preachy"" and too condescending for my personal taste. There are far better books out there that deal with the philosophical topics behind spirituality that is ""non-christian"", and I just HATE to be told that one-way-is-the-only-way. Happy hunting!"
3,Dry Reading I don't care for it.,This book is not what it appears to be. It is more into describing how the Farrars practice the Craft and have their rituals. I wouldn't say it's to followed verbatim unless you're into the same kind of practice they are. One thing you should be aware of is that their practice is held skyclad. I am not a prude but I also believe it's the persons descretion to perform skyclad.There isn't much in there that actually speaks to the Witch in the making but it's more of an informational guide on how to hold rituals and circles ala Farrar. I found it hard to read and understand. Not much of the laymens terms in there a lot of high language and such. Enter at your own risk.
3,OK - but not the best,"This was an interesting find, but was not very helpful in my initial quests to find some clear, concise information on Witchcraft."
4,Fantastic reference,"This book covers classical Wicca and, even though it contains historical issues it's still a valuable reference."
3,good,As all will agree there is no true recording of the old ways. this book does help to pull some of the pieces together.
3,"informative, albeit dated and organizationally lazy","First off, this is *not* a Bible. Picking that title was misleading.It is, however, a useful collection of rituals and social discussion, with appendices, glossary and notes. All this, however, could have been much better; it's really two books bound together. Therefore, you have two indexes, two sets of page numbering, and so forth. Why in the name of Hades a little effort wasn't put into the integration of the two books mystifies me; it has a sense of having been republished as a single volume mainly because no one would have to do any real work.The only other serious flaw is that they take _The White Goddess_ as some form of gospel. Looks pretty silly when Robert Graves, the author of _TWG_, has apologized for many of the blithe assertions therein.Useful if read critically, and less annoying than most books on Wicca. Too bad a little more effort wasn't put into some editorial basics."
2,I've read better books on the subject,"Sure, you can learn a lot from this book, but it seemed a bit un-organized to me. I tried to look up certain things in it, but finding what I was after took forever. Also, I felt like the book was a bit too ""This is how we do it, this is how it's done, and it's the only acceptable way"". Maybe you won't get the same vibe from it as I did, but if I knew what I know now, I wouldn't have bought it, and I probably won't ever use it. So it's just sitting there on my book shelf, gathering dust.However, if you want to write a paper of study on how some wiccans practise their religion, this book would be of great help, but if your goal is to find your own path, I wouldn't recommend this book."
5,Wow! : },"This book has sat on my shelf for years, I've skimmed it and only just got around to reading it cover to cover recently. I am not Gardnerian or Alexandrian, but the info in this book is important for all, even me, the solitary. It is a bit hard to follow in some places, but I liked it anyway. I would say for anybody to read it, certainly, I just wouldn't let less open-minded people get too good a view of the cover or the pictures inside. : } Blessed Be, all!"
3,Very informative,"This is a very good book, but some of the information could be confusing for some readers. I would however, recommend it to more experienced witches."
5,Love it,The water bird arrived in great shape. My husband was thrilled to receive a gift he remembered from his childhood.
5,Lovely way to end the day,"The prose and pictures are sweet reminders of the ways family members share love. I agree with the review by ""trumama"", the line ""love is when somebody quietly listens to everything you have to say"" is a reminder to me to stop during my busy day and give my children what they want most-- my time."
3,furniture sliders,"Not exactly as avertized. On the package it says ""for carpet"". I orginally bought this thinking it would be great for floors too. It works well on floors but could be better."
3,Okay for the right person/purpose.,"I was looking for something I could quickly throw my computer into to protect my computer inside my backpack. It turned out to be larger than I expected. It doesn't fit in my backpack. I'm not sure how else I would use it. This particular fabric (brown corduroy) seems to attract pet hair, so I don't use it around the house. Maybe if I had my laptop floating around my office, I would use it there. For that, I'd probably want something with more padding/protection, though."
2,Falsely Advertised,"""Bicycle Double Pack Poker Size Standard Index Rider Back Playing Cards with Bonus Dice"" is the name of this item, but the cards in the pack are not Rider Backs. They are Bicycle Standard decks. Not to say that the Standard decks are bad, but I needed Rider Backs. In the Standard decks, all the suit pips are smaller, and on the face cards, the pictures are smaller as well. Also, there is a slightly bigger gap between the edge of the card and the Number/Letter and suit at the corners, so when you fan the cards, you can't see the letters and suits as well. Not particularly disappointed in the cards themselves, but the fact that they were falsely advertised. The box says Rider Back but when you open the box, they are Standards. If you just want any regular deck of bicycles, get this. If you particularly want Rider Backs, don't."
4,Good enough,"I bought these for a weekend trip. They aren't very firm and were easily bent. I play cards maybe a few times a year, so I'm not worried if they will last. But these definitely are not super heavy duty cards."
2,Terrible sound quality mars this otherwise cool reissue,"I loved it that ABKCO released several of the classic Rolling Stones catalog from the 60's in the British versions as well as the more familiar American albums. In the case of Aftermath in particular, the buyer gets a much better album than the American version. I also bought the UK versions of Between the Buttons and Out of Our Heads. The latter purchase was a big disappointment however. In general, the sound quality has been extraordinary on the ABKCO releases on hybrid SACD. Out of Our Heads UK is the exception. The sound quality is muddy and extremely low fi. I am assuming that the original masters must be in poor condition, because other albums from the same period, like Big Hits, High Tide Green Grass sound fine. I applaud the idea of releasing the British Out of Our Heads album, because it is a cool selection of cover tunes and Jagger/Richards originals, but the atrocious sound quality makes it a bad purchase choice."
1,Pentax failed to produce a reliable product,"I would strongly suggest that other consumers stay away from purchasing this camera. One water drop will send you to the repair shop with an $80 bill, not to mention the faulty lens cover and unreliablility of the camera overall. Pictures have a tendency to be dark and grainy."
3,great camera if you like devil eyes,"Love this camera. Portable, easy, moron proof. But, you better never use the flash to photograph your kids. You will see the most amazing red eye, even using the red eye reduction. I just wish I had bought it from Amazon. Then at least it would have given me devil eyes for 100 bucks less."
3,Could have been better,"I agree that this could have been a better film. It never quite finds its pace as a thriller, gets a little too into slasher territory. Less gore and more suspense would have helped. The ending is ridiculous, as others have pointed out. The cliche of the criminally insane genius is so played out -- next we'll be expected to believe that a guy like that has godlike powers. Still, it's not a bad movie. Bad guys and good guys alike get killed in inventive ways. There are a few surprises. The cast is good, Jamie Foxx as an assistant district attorney, Gerard Butler as the victim of a violent crime. If you're in the mood to veg out with a movie, this one be fine."
3,STUNNING PERFORMANCES WITH NICE DRAMA!,"Well, I was expecting this to be an okay movie with everything on its place and nothing else. But actually this is one very good film with two MAJOR quality elements here:FIRSTThe performances are amazing. Both Gerard Butler and Jamie Foxx are STUNNING. Their characters are complex and all motivational elements were beautifully written. Foxx is no surprise, but Butler did surprise me. I wasn't expecting him to be such a great actor... but he is.SECONDThe premise is brilliant: a man has to deal with the fact that the man who murdered his family gets a deal. This is amazing material,Not so great things: unfortunately, as the second half unfolds, the film tries to become a heavy thriller (and gets a little contrived) and somehow tends to forget the amazing premise and drama it started with.Still... this is a very good film to watch."
4,"""I need a shower, Warden.""","This was a much better revenge film than I thought it would be. Lots of twists and turns that I was not expecting from the Butler character.I like Gerard Butler, Jamie Foxx, Colm Meaney, Bruce McGill and Josh Stewart, which were all the main reasons that I watched this film. And I'm glad that I did because most of the actors turned a mediocre plot into a good movie. Butler was great in his role as the vengeance-driven engineer with a secret past. Foxx was not so great - wooden, one-dimensional (if he'd been on the top of his game, this would have been a stellar movie). The others were great in their supporting roles.The ending could have been more fitting to the direction the rest of the film went but I enjoyed it.NOTE: Lots of violence, rape scene, language, torture."
3,Personal preference:,"I personally could see this happening. I would probably feel about the same way as his character did, now whether I would be smart enough to carry this out, is another story, or dumb enough."
5,HELLOFAMOVIE,If you like cerebral crime movies... this is the movie for you. Don't try and figure it out just let it develop and you will love it.
2,Good production . Bad director,This movie starts great and has a very exciting story line and keeps you excited until the end but the ending is poorly written and directed. I already thought of couple of endings that would make the movie more exciting and suiting the story line.
1,The potential....,"This movie until the last 5 mins was really great, could have been one of the best movies of 2009 - but then the horrendous ending came along and totally killed the WHOLE movie. This movie falls flatter than a pancake at Wafflehouse. I mean the first 90ish minutes is a 5 star movie, ending drops it to 1.****SPOILERS****Why would I want to see a movie where the morally bankrupt lawyer wins!? In a situation where the protagonists' wife and 10-year old daughter are raped and murdered, the entire system deserves to be brought down. If I go to a movie where the system screws over the little guy and that little guy comes back to dish out real justice, I absolutely, positively DO NOT want to see the ""system"" win in the end, regardless of any Hollywood-ed glossed over change of heart the corrupt lawyer might happen to have. Just goes to show that even in making the movie about Selling out - the Director sells the audience out as well.****SPOILERS****"
3,Denzel would have been a better fit!,"**SPOILERS** I liked this film overall. Good story. Good Revenge. Bad Jamie Foxx performance ESPECIALLY the ending! Jamie Foxx in Ray was awesome but in this film just did not cut it as an intelligent (or I should say more intelligent than Gerard Butlers) character. His lines were weak and the ending, rushing a high-powered explosive to that cell that quickly?! No way. I did enjoy Gerard Butler and his intelligence in this film. The kill scenes were cool and while the entire film was of course only somewhat believable I enjoyed it. Denzel Washington would have been awesome as his opponent in my opinion. Will probably buy it when it goes for much less."
1,"Fun to use, terribly poor materials design.","My gf bought this product about 4 months ago. We thought it'd be an easy way to get exercise in front of the TV.I way about 190lbs and used the product about 3x/week.It completely failed when the u-bolt pushed completely through the center bar/pole. So I used the product ~50x and now it will be thrown in the trash, because it failed in a way that is beyond repair.Its just bad engineering as you can see that someone didn't calculate the force that would be applied to the backside of the center bar/pole.I liked the product, but found that its materials were of extremely poor/cheap quality. I will not buy any more Wagan Tech products."
3,o.k for the price,"The pros of this item is that its small, and fits well in small rooms. Its an o.k workout. As good as your more expensive ones. The Con is that its super squeeky. I wanted to be able to work out while my family and I are watching tv, but its too loud. And this happened the 2nd day of use."
1,Not from any live performance,"As per original Rolling Stone Magazine review: This is a compilation of ""Live"" tracks, studio recording, aka fake.>Got Live (If You Want It!) is a 06/11/65 U.K. EP DFE-8620 mono DECCA U.K. only EP. Germany DECCA/Telefunken created the 12 track LP. The original concert in 1964 was at the Royal Albert Hall, not the 12 track vinyl or CD audio. The genuine DFE-8620 mono EP is reproduced in the new 12 CD 1963-1965 abkco Box set.Germany DECCA (only) 6.22429 ""Got Live"" was created in-studio with cleverly added canned applauses. It's a fake item, nice pictures, but the performance never happened. It was 1964 original, but has ""Under My Thumb"", from the 1966 After-Math, and 1967 ""Get Off Of My Cloud."" Check with Rolling Stone Magazine, their 'poor' review is correct. The CD and LP are from many ""LIVE"" venues, not all are from The Royal Albert Hall!>Suggest: buy the new 1963-1965 abkco 'singles/EPs box set."
2,not a good live Stones album,"This album isn't really a ""must own"" Stones album. The recording features screaming teenage girls more than the music of the band. I have the remastered edition, and the audience levels still way overpower the band."
2,"Poor recording, poor performance","I am a huge Stones fan. They were one of the great bands of my youth. This CD sucks. It has poor quality sound; It is a weak performance; And the Stones themselves are ashamed of it. I didn't bother to read the reviews before I bought it, and I don't want you to repeat my mistake. If you absolutely must sample this release, make sure it is the very last Stones album you buy. Trust me, brothers and sisters, you won't get no satisfaction from this CD."
5,Brings Back Memories,"I used to listen to these guys when their albums first emerged in the late 60's. The music is just so much fun to hear again! Perrey & Kingsley may not have been very popular in their time, but they made an enduring mark in history that has influenced many later recording artists. They were truly pioneers. As you listen, keep in mind that these recordings were done long before there was such a thing as ""sampling""... many of the rhythms are accomplished using loops of hand-spliced reel-to-reel tape (remember that stuff?).Perrey & Kingsley's version of Moon River has been playing in my head for (I think) the last 35 years... it is one of the most beautiful and haunting treatments of this song I have ever heard. Fallout has also been a favorite, along with others you will surely recognize. Just buy the CD and get ready to smile!"
2,The mouse pointer hangs,"For the price this product is substandard. The mouse pointer will hang and then when it comes back on, the pointer will be halfway across the screen. This happens intermittently, not all the time. I am running 32 bit Vista."
3,Good keyboard. Awful mouse.,The setup of this on a Win 7 computer was dead simple. Plug in the USB and reboot and that was it.The keyboard is great. I was already using the v4000 wired version of this keyboard and this one is identical. They keys seem a bit mushier compared to the crisp feel of the v4000 but otherwise a comfortable layout. One issue I had with the v4000 was that the legs on the keyboard kept closing. It remains to be see if that problem persists on this version.The mouse is awful. It is so big that I imagine that anyone at Microsoft actually used this thing and thought it was a good idea. It fills your palm and then some and raises your hand well above the table. Not a comfortable feeling at all.The good thing is that the new keyboard seems to work well with my old wireless mouse and so far the two USB adapters aren't interfering with each other.My Recommendation: Buy the keyboard and avoid the mouse.
3,"Great Keyboard, Awesome Mouse, HORRIBLE glitchiness.","I've been using MS ergonomic keyboards for years and was excited to get this set. I had to return it before the week was out, however, because it would constantly miss keystrokes and the mouse was glitchy.I do have a wireless router close by, but I disabled wireless and it did not solve the problem.The keyboard and mouse were both within 3 feet of the receiver.I replaced this with a wired MS ergonomic keyboard and a Logitech G500 wired mouse."
2,Microsoft Ergonomic Desktop 7000,"I've used these keyboards for years and really like them. That said, I may return this one. The keys are very stiff. The space bar is over the top stiff. This isn't exactly ergonomic!"
1,"Ok keyboard, worst mouse I have ever used.","The keyboard is so-so. Seems to work ok, but took me 3 weeks to get even close to comfortable typing on it. Very randomly sized buttons and weird spacing just didn't feel anything like the other microsoft natural it was replacing.The mouse on the other hand was designed by someone without hands. It took all of 5 minutes for it to start hurting my hand and wrist. Not to mention the amazing amount of jitter. If you hold it still for a while and then try to move it again there is almost a second of lag for it to realize you are moving it. Doesn't seem like much to most people I am sure. The problem is if you play any kind of game it can ruin them for you. All in all a horrible mouse. I replaced it 2 weeks after I purchased this combo."
2,Multimedia,"Well i like the keyboard but i must say i was disappointed to see that their were no multimedia functions on the keyboard, no next, previous etc, this was my main reason why i lost interest into the keyboard. Next reason comes from the fact that when i do press the pause button it fails to respond besides that it's a gr8 keyboard."
3,"Love it, but......","I had the model 4000 of this keyboard, which is corded. I had to purchase a new keyboard and thought I would try this model. I love everything about it, except, It really hangs up when typing and you have to pause and wait on it to catch up. Same thing happens with the mouse from time to time. I'm not that fast, but when you are on a roll and have to go back and wait for everything to catch up and then retype, it's a pain. I have done some upgrades to my computer and will see if that helps some. If so and it solves this problem, I would change my rating to 5 stars."
2,"Great concept, clunky execution","Hand placement on the keyboard is very comfortable, but the keys are too difficult to press, especially the space bar.The idea of the mouse is nice, but it's far too massive. My hand was not large enough to ""wrap"" over the side/top as the directions recommend; I'm a tallish woman with long/large hands, so this was surprising. The mouse was also too difficult to move due to its size/weight.Would be more convenient if this were a Bluetooth setup. The connection was wonky at times and keystrokes would get dropped or repeated. Super annoying. Plus I didn't like having the receiver take up one of my USB slots.The software worked well with my Mac OS. For example, keyboard shortcuts I was used to like Apple+W for ""close window"" translated to Alt+W (same key placement). The built-in shortcut buttons like Volume and Calculator worked nicely as well."
2,"decent keyboard, useless mouse","Having used Microsoft Ergonomic keyboard 4000 for a year now, I thought, it might be a good time to upgrade to this wireless keyboard/mouse. I was wrong. Keyboard is good, except for the missing capslock and numlock indicators. However the mouse is crappy, the worst mouse design I have ever seen. Who in their right sense of mind can come up with such a design, I wonder. Extremely uncomfortable and results in wrist and thumb-joint ache within a few hours of using it. I have since switched to the good old wired mouse. So, am left with an expensive wireless keyboard. Advice - go for Microsoft Ergokeyboard 4000. It is much better."
2,"Kinda crap, to be honest","Keyboard has trouble communicating with my pc, which is about 10-12 inches away. Lotsa lost keystrokes requiring chair fidgeting. BS. Mouse is super spazzy too, even with slowed settings, though is at least a comfy grip. All in all, like the Logitech I use at home way better other than the fact that the MS has the ergo keyboard, which is way comfier. Shame bowt all the lost keystrokes..,"
2,What a WASTE of money!!!!,"Just got this desktop set less than a week ago. Loved the Wired Ergo Keyboard (4000) so I wanted to go wireless.The mouse works like a charm but the Keyboard does not... . I Thought were the batteries included, so changed them and still the same...Resetted connection on receiver/keyboard thousands of times and nothing, randomly works and suddenly keyboard goes away when I'm typing.Since I'm not from US it's a total waste of money requesting a replacement...so is this desktop set. Next time I'll listen to my friends and get a Logitech one.Real bad product, not recommended since I've seen some really bad reviews about it."
4,Great ergo wireless combo,"This was a great buy for me. I need a wireless desktop solution to work wih for my new computer. My requirements: wireless keyboard and mouse, must be ergonomical with wave style / split keyboard, Multimedia or programmable buttons. I looked at the Desktop 4000 and 6000 series sets but finally chose the 7000. Although a bit pricy ($90), the comfor and performance is well worth it. My favorite part is the keyboard as I am using a lot of hot keys to do my application launches and within application shortcuts. The mouse feels great too. No more wrist pain from traditional flat mouse movements. I like the zoom/magnify button as I am about 10 feet away from my screen. Overall, well worth the investment. The reason I rated it as a 4 star instead of 5 stars is the price. If the price was under $70, I would have rated it as 5 stars."
2,Quiet but flawed...,"I'm am typing the review on the keyboard and mouse. It looks great, feels fantastic and the mouse is wonderful. Unfortunatley the funtionality is lacking. The ""Y"" and ""U"" key are always stuck. I may have just gotten a defected one, but the shipping took too long to get to me and I use this for work. Just press EXTRA hard on the ""Y"" and ""U"" key and I think you'll be pleased.PROs:Looks greatFeels GreatMouse is awesomeCons:keyboard does not type well."
3,mouse not made well,"While I have been happy with the wireless keyboard, the wireless mouse started falling apart -- the rubber began to peel off of the grips. I've never had a mouse actually fall apart. Microsoft tells me that they will only warranty the mouse for three years. By the time I called them, I was one month over the warranty. I recommend buying the keyboard separately so that you do not waste money on a defective mouse."
2,"Keep the Keyboard, Chuck the Mouse","This will typically be the costliest bundle on the shelves, and so you'd hope it'd be the best. Warning: You need LARGE hands to fully benefit from the ergonomics. I have smaller hands, obviously. The keyboard's design is comfortable, once you get used to the extra reach between the keys. However, the bigger problem rests with the mouse, literally. If the design team thinks that dragging the sides of your palm across your desk or mousepad is preferable, then I'd challenge them to do it for hours on hours, day after day, week after week. My palms get red and chafed. And honestly, the size of the mouse is too bulky and too heavy for constant use. I tried to convince myself to just get used to it, but now my wrists are starting to hurt. I'll keep the keyboard and chuck the mouse. But I can't get half my money back."
2,Very frustrating experience,"I was using a wireless keyboard and mouse at work that worked really well and decided to buy the 7000 for my home office.Win7 made setup and installation a dream but the keyboard is pretty much a disaster. Keystrokes are delayed constantly and I have no idea if my typing is being taken or not. Tried re-installing the drivers and re-starting the machine but to no avail. The mouse is great except for the scrolling wheel. It is so tight that in the one week of use, I have not been able to scroll a single webpage using the wheel!!! What is the whole point of having a fancy wheel if you can't scroll down a page? When the wheel finally works it does a few page-downs in one shot. In all, I am very disappointed and thinking of returning it. My husband had bought the same 7000 a while ago and returned it for similar reasons."
1,"Grapefruit Mouse Meets the ""Typo Factory""","After weeks of giving myself a chance to adapt to it, I've decided that this keyboard and mouse set may be ""ergonomic"" for some species, but homo-sapiens isn't one of them.The mouse fits the hand like a grapefruit with a scroll-wheel, and allowed me to finally experience what using ""the computer"" must feel like for my left-handed 90 year old mother.And the keyboard goes back in the box with a well deserved nickname: ""The Typo Factory"".If you order this item, be sure to hang on to the original packaging."
4,Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Desktop 7000,This keyboard takes a little bit of getting used to but it is a fine keyboard and easily programmed to work like a Mac keyboard. The mouse is a little bit heavy and kind of difficult to maneuver but I think it will work just fine once I get accustomed to operating it.
4,Pro's and Con's,"The keyboard rocks. The angles are awesome and no connection issues so far. It also handles my speed typing very well.All Pro's .... exceptOnly Con - the space bar is louder then I would like it to be. So much so that I won't use it if my 14 month old is asleep for the night.Mouse - got it because it was a set and I needed one and didn't want to make a trip to the store. I should have. Its very heavy, to the point where it effects the able to slide around. The two main click buttons are also very loud as well."
1,wow,"must be 20 words long? how about this: this is the worst keyboard I've ever purchased.I was skeptical about the keyboard, but I gave it a chance, and I got burned.Will never purchase any hardware from M$ again."
4,Good developer reference,This is a well-written and example oriented book for C/C++ programmers that covers secure programming in all aspects. I had been using this book for last one year now and It helps me as a quick reference and also real source code demonstrating practical approaches that can be incorporated into their software projects.The book needs a little update but still helps any aspiring C/C++ programmer involved with crypto.
2,Not what I expected,"While there are some good quotes in this book, I don't think this book is really about the Gulf War. It is more about a soldier's struggle to deal with his duties. I will not criticize the author for his views on the army and the war itself, but the book really sheds little light on the war. The author is an artist educated at Columbus College of Art and Design, from my reading he is against the war. There a couple of good photographs but most of them are of troops and trucks sitting in the desert. This is not a book for someone looking for a comprehensive look at the Gulf War."
1,Obituray to Warner's writing career,"Another revisionist polemics from Warner, who is a Sandhurst lecturer like Gary Sheffield, author of another polemics, Forgotten Victory.Both authors have axes to grind, and would not hesitate to spin devious half truths and outright lies to prove that the BEF was winning all along, it being the most professional army led by courageous, smart generals like Haig.With no researches of any kind, the author has managed to draw starling revisionist conclusions that would be farcical if not for all the blood spilled."
2,Not good for boom boxes,I bought these batteries to use with my Sirius boombox and they will power the unit for only about an hour or so before the unit shuts off.
1,The MAHA rechargeable Ni-MH D-Cell is 10000 mah - nuf said !,This batterys specs is baffling - it should be at least 8K - the MAHA NiMH D-Cell is 10K millamps / hour.
2,You Get What You Pay For,These batteries only lasted in the baby's swing for 2 days. I bought some good rechargeables that last a couple of weeks at a time and use these only to hold me over while the good ones are charging.
2,"obnoxious, but great songs","Boy are the kids on this video sickeningly sweet! ugh! Reminds me of Barney. My 3-year-old and my 2-year-old both love the songs, but this movie drives me crazy! It does have tons of great kids songs, but if you can't stand Barney, don't get it or anything else by Kidsongs!"
3,"Dubal's ego aside, a fascinating snapshot of a Maestro","Yes! Dubal loves to impress the reading public of how knowledgable he is. When you get around this, however, here is an interesting side of Horowitz that allows you to see the excentricities and warmth of one of the greatest pianists of this century. After listening to one of Horowitz's students about his lessons and meetings over three years with the Maestro, I have to say that Dubal has captured the real personality and intellect of Horowitz. The stories are fascinating and for any piano student, like me, this is an absorbing read. Not a great book....but one for travel and vacation that is easy to read, without the voluminous footnotes."
2,a lot of filler,"I learned some useful stuff, but now that stand-alone routers can be bought at appliance stores for the price of a VCR, this book is mostly obsolete.There's at least 100 pages of filler (a glossary and a quickly obsolete list of ISPs), which says something unflattering about a book."
3,"Solid, yet somewhat impractical","There's only so much you can do at home working out. This book has no doubt exhausted every possible exercise one could even imagine doing at home. For example..ones I had never even thought of include the Swiss-Ball Preacher Curl, Neider Press, Bulgarian Split Squat, and Towel Curl to name a few.Just how practical these are, however, for actually engendering substantial muscle gains is questionable. The book also makes extensive reference to a plethora of cable exercises when, let's face it, most people do not have cable weights in their home gym. Overall, a solid reference, but not overly practical."
3,Excellent if you just have Dumbbells,This is a very good book esp. for people who work out a lot previously to reading this. It has different variations that you may not have heard of before. The instructions of how to do the workout are pretty plain and assume you already know what you are doing. Lifting without knowing how can lead to extreme shoulder pain and issuesPretty good book but gets boring after a couple of weeks of doing the same stuff.I give it a 6 out of 10
3,book,good book for just starting into working out and want to know what kind of equipment to get and how to exercise. I think it worth buying.
1,Not The Dukes of yesteryear!,"This CD should have a parental advisory. Uncle Jessie from the tv series would NEVER have told THOSE jokes, and Southern Culture on the Skids would never played The Boars Nest. My 9 year old son was so excited to get the soundtrack, as we listened to it together, I was SHOCKED. I may be over reacting, but I didn't expect to hear mention of male genitalia on a soundtrack for a movie that originated from such a wholesome family program. Disgusting, just disgusting!"
2,Left Off WAY Too Many Songs,"First of all, the movie was AWESOME - hands down best movie I've seen this year. Throughout the entire movie, I kept thinking, ""I have GOT to get this soundtrack"". So I get home and hop on Amazon.com, and look at it, and think, ""wow, where are all the songs?"" Great songs the soundtrack left out:AC/DC ""If you Want Blood""Mountain ""Mississippi Queen""ZZ Top ""La Grange""Ram Jam ""Black Betty""And those are just the few that I can think of off the top of my head. I think the soundtrack should've left off Uncle Jesse's jokes, and put those songs in. Needless to say, I did not purchase it."
4,Something's missing!,"Any compilation of Mason William's best that doesn't include The Prince's Panties is shortchanging listeners. Still, there're enoughgoodies here to warrant four stars. Would've beenfive if not for the glaring omission."
3,"Be careful of ""Classical Gas"" on this compilation","Anyone expecting the original version of ""Classical Gas"" (which was a hit on the radio in the late '60s) will be disappointed to find that this CD has an acoustic version of the song with a single guitar. I bought the album primarily for this song, so was disappointed that I will have to buy another one to get the orchestrated version. That said, there is a lot of good material here, including ""Largo De Luxe."" Williams wasn't much of a singer, and that is made amply clear by his attempts at vocalizing. When he sticks to his orchestral numbers, he is generally very good."
4,Replacement Filter,This is a replacement filter for the Intex above ground pool.It does a good job filtering the pool water.Execellent buy from Amazon.
4,Good Quality Volleyball,It looks ok. I didn't know the difference between the numbered sizes so Had to take a chance when I ordered. It arrived in good shape.
2,Not worth the price.,"After receiving this ball I was not impressed with the quality so I did some further research and confirmed my suspicions. This ball can be had for $10 dollars else where which is what this ball looks like up close, a $10 ball.If some one knows where I can get a high quality traditional ball that is not covered in logos, please let me know."
1,without flavor,the most flavorless dark chocolate I have ever tasted. flat taste melts crumbly in your mouth.I prefer a rich powerful chocolate with a smooth texture.
1,I don't like it,"This product is ok, but it pisses my off. I don' t like that it does that, so i don't like it."
2,Not for the average dog owner,"Sorry - But this video is not for the average dog owner! If you identify with the punk rock scene and are looking for an alternative to the standard dog training video then this might work for you. This video shows basic training techniques, but the narrator's ""voice over"" distracts from the actual training process going on. The korny doggy-do and doggy-don't skits attempt to show the viewer correct training techniques and obvious training mistakes,but are a waste of time.Maybe worth $8 but definitely not the $22.95 price tag. I would return it if not for amazon's return policy against returning opened videos."
4,This book seems to be *the* book on this topic.,"I am only in the first 1/4 of this book, but I can say that the text is clear and the exercises are useful. A small down side was some typos in the solved exercises, that's why it is a 4.While I haven't finised the text yet, I peeked ahead and it seems to be a winner. I chose this book to be my backgrounder before going through Watt's 3rd Ed. on Computer Graphics.I find that this book shows me math tools and I actually think about why they are useful, not just how they are useful.I think it is sad that algorithms books get more reviews (and sales?) while accessible, foundational books like this one get ignored, based on the low number of reviews. Maybe its because they don't use a slick looking sample of ray tracing or radiosity on the front cover ;-).This is a book for first principles! Check it out."
1,Do not buy,"I am a registered midwife and this dictionary would be too basic even for a first year midwifery student, as the definitions have so little content as to be useless. Unfortunate but true! Hardly any appendices, and it says it is evidence based where possible but there is no evidence based information anywhere.What I highly recommend instead is the latest, 2004? 2003? edition of Balliere's Dictionary for Midwives (Denise Tiran - editor)- in depth definitions that give accurate, very useful information and fantastic, useful appendices. This one is a wise investment and far more illustrated that the so-called Illustrated Dictionary of Midwifery which has hardly any illustrations compared to Balliere's and of poor quality."
3,PYLE-PRO PDMR5 - 5'' High Performance Midrange Driver,"I will use thePYLE-PRO PDMR5 - 5'' High Performance Midrange Drivers I purchased in a Center Channel speaker I am designing and building for my Living room. I will provide enough volume combined with Tweeters and a couple of crossover arrangements to fill the area. Backed up by a Powered Subwoofer, 15 Inch, behind the Theater System."
2,is OK,"I have the board game version as well and I would much rather play the board game with someone than play against them on the playstation. It is ok if you want to play against the computer, but much more fun to play the board game."
4,pink vest,The fushia vest I purchased came quickly and was the color and quality I was expecting.I was very pleased with how easy it was to order and how fast it arrived.
5,Buy this CD now!,"Quite possibly one of the best kept secrets in Rock,The Go is an album that fans of Classic/Indie Rock should adore. This CD has it all: The songs, the musicianship, and the attitude that will make you wonder why these guys aren't one of the biggest bands in Rock, or at least bigger than that ""other"" Detroit band, The White Stripes. Do yourself a favor and buy this album now, or better yet, catch them live."
2,Quality material/ Poor design,"Well made, but I don't use it. The grommet on the front scratches my knife. I'm not overly picky but am disappointed. The sheath was recommended for my skeletool cx when I bought my knife on Amazon."
3,Needs major work.,"For the price, this pouch isn't bad. I feel like this thing was rushed and needs to be refined more. I like the ""premium nylon sheath"" more as a every day item.What this needs is:slightly wider sheath, it is a little too narrow.The elastic loops on the side like the premium nylon for button battery lights and the bit driver. Everything is too crowded in this.MOLLE seems iffy, The vertical belt carry might be iffy.I like that the construction is a little heavier than the other sheath. Having MOLLE capabilities is always nice. The closure is much better than previous ones. I like how the drain grommet actually has metal this time around instead of a crappy hole cut out. It also looks cooler IMO.This sheath does not like my surge too much. With my 40 bits, replacement file, and bit driver, I can hardly fit the surge in it."
5,I lover racing for the answer!,"This is a party game if I ever did see one. Everyone plays every round so nobody is bored waiting for their turn. The board is a simple race track and sometimes we leave the baord at home and play this in the car. All players race to solve the scramble and the categories provide not only different subject areas but varying levels of difficulty. The 'numbers' category is an interesting twist. Good, old fashion fun and a refreshing change to some of the mindless game out there -- I recommend it. I love word games and this is one of the best."
2,Not so interesting book about really interesting stuff,"If you're already familiar with the concepts of cryogenics and nanotechnology, this book will not offer anything new and in my opinion doesn't do the exciting potential futures these technologies enable justice.If you're looking for information on Trashumanism, this book is not the place to go either. Regis just briefly touches on the movement, and again failed to excite me with his account of it. The Web is a much better resource for information on Transhumanism; in particular check out Ander's Transhumanism Pages...As for the alleged humor in the book, I must have missed it.All in all this book was a real disappointment. I'm interested both in the Transhumanism movement and the technologies they embrace, but Great Mambo Chicken (despite the amusing title) did not offer an interesting view of either."
3,False advertising,"This book seems like a courtroom thriller/action book. It does have a bit of both, but not enough to qualify really being within either genre. It's no great book, and makes for a nice, light read (definitely better than Maximum Ride)I understand that everyone has their own writing style, but I found Mr. Patterson's own to be rather irritating. He often forgoes a lot of detail and some of his scenes simply feel thrown together. if Mr. Patterson would work on fleshing out scenes and thinking more about his characters and their actions, he'd be a better author. Quality over quantity, after all."
2,Brain candy,"Like all of Patterson's novels, this one is also brain candy. And like candy, when we feel weak we can't resist and succumb. Candy tastes good while one is eating it, but afterwards you wonder ""Why did I do it? What a waste."" Same for reading Patterson's novels."
2,Disappointing,"Yes it's easy and fast to read with large print and rarely more than three pages to a chapter. But the story borders on ridiculous, the characters are lame-brained and the writing hovers over the level of ""Reader's Digest"". I've read much, much better Patterson."
3,This is a novel?,"This book is the literary version of a cable TV mob show. The characters are shallow and stereotypical, and the story is predictable. This is bubble gum for the mind..."
5,wonderful,"I loved this book!!! I bought it before a flight. The flight was for 10 hours, I couldn't sleep but finish the book."
4,A different ending than what I thought..,"I never could of imagined the the ending to turn out like that.And no im not giving away the ending,But i dont feel the ending had closure to it.It didnt give the reader a sence of closure.I will give this book a 4 star,it wasnt to bad of a book.It was good clear up untill the end.....Book owl"
1,Why is the price of the MAC Version 5 time the price of the PC version?,"What the tile says.Shame on Amazon, fix this please. I would buy this game but not at this price."
4,A&E III,anyone how liked A&E II will love this game It works grate on the MAC with the improved graphics are grate!
1,Fact or fantasy?,"A previous reviewer has noted some examples Sora's ""liberties"" with facts. For me it was page 39 where we are informed that in 1919 the German Fleet, hiding in Scapa Flow, scuttled its ships rather than ""surrender from its hiding place"". Mr. Sora is clearly not aware that Scapa Flow was home to the British Grand Fleet, some forty Battleships, Cruisers, Dreadnoughts and Destroyers and that the German High Seas Fleet was not hiding there, but had, in fact, surrendered there.When basic, well documented, facts are ignored or distorted, how can the rest of this work be taken seriously?"
4,TEACH YOUR CHILD COLORS WITH CLASSIC POOH,"This book is in the old pooh style of drawing which looks much different than what we are used to today. There are two examples for each color...Poohs sweater is red, Piglet's scarf is red. Includes orange sunset, white snow, purple flowers and yellow and black bees."
2,A Conversation Book,"I was disappointed that there was a missing CD to the book. Otherwise the A Conversation Book, is good and informative."
5,Just like the title says.,"This is not a know it all book on Perl, but it will get you started coding and executing right away.I liked the way Les takes you through coding a program step by step and then explaining what each step accomplishes. The book has about 20 coding and execution examples, some just pure perl, some using HTML and some with a little javascript. Even if you don't know these areas you get the feel for how Perl interfaces with them.The book will also take you into ways to do some data base interfacing. Les uses Microsofts Access for the data base example, but will also work if you know mySQL. Les will even give you steps for setting up the PWS (Personal Web Server) on non Windows XP operating systems like W98.The last chapter takes you through a complete case study using a contact data base using some web design principles.With the exception of a a few minor coding errors, this book in my opinion is top notch and the very best for getting a good head start on learning Perl."
3,neem doggy shampoo,"Used it twice and it smells great/works up a good lather, but my dogs still scratch afterwards, but that may not be the shampoos fault. We have a severe flea problem in the summer months and I'm going to start using Advantage II TODAY to see if that helps. The Frontline Plus isn't keeping the fleas at bay for a month!"
3,"Not bad, but quickly loses its appeal","We bought this for our daughter for her second birthday (about two months ago). At first she loved the idea of having her own vacuum. She would follow me around when I vaccumed with our real one. After a couple of months though, the toy has lost its original appeal. Our daughter realizes the larger vacuum actually picks up things so she would rather play with it.We have not had any problems with parts breaking, but that may be from the lack of use."
3,Doesn't pick up Properly,This vacuum doesn't clean up right. If you try to pick up a piece of dust it wouldn't pick it up. When you are around ages 4-6 you will enjoy this toy. You can switch it from carpet to floor. This toy gets boring at age 7. At that age I have not been having fun with it. I gave it to my sister who is 5. She is having so much fun with it! This toy teaches kids that cleaning is fun.
5,What a great vacuum!,"My 21/2 year old son recieved this vacuum for Christmas and absolutely loves it. Last year, we got him the cheaper Dirt Devil because we weren't sure of his reaction and also because it was smaller and lighter. Well, it wound up being his favorite toy. So this year, we upgraded to the Hoover Wind Tunnel just like ours and he has been vacuuming ever since. It is just like ours with the attachments, hose, and switches for carpet or hard floor with carpet height adjustment. I have found it to be durable so far, being only one week old. We were very pleased with both vacuums, but this one is definately much more realistic. I would highly recommend this to anyone who's toddler loves the vacuum. Lets just hope they love it a few years down the road when chore time comes along!!!"
4,FINALLY!!,I finally found a toy my 15 month old son will play with for more than 10 minutes. He constantly wanted me to take my vacuum out of the closet so he can play with it so I thought I'd get one for him. I did feel a little funny buying this for a boy but since most of the reviews were boys I thought I'd give it a try and are so glad that I did. His face lit up when we took it out of the box and he even got more excited when we put batteries in and turned it on. Now he pretends to vacuum like us. He does still like my vaccum but at least doesn't ask for it as much. All and all - GREAT TOY if your child is facinated by your vacuum!!
4,In consideration...,"I must say I enjoyed the book mostly because of its variety of perspectives. Looking at the reviews other people have given, many people offered comments about stories being ""too short"" or ""leaving you hanging"" which I found mildly ironic because that is sort of the way most short stories are, and if you read any other compilation of short stories, you'll notice it is true with them also. I would reccomend it to those who enjoy stories leaning towards the abstract, or those who really enjoy a variety of reading selections."
4,I don't know...,I can't say I like the Shrek Chia as much as I do the Scooby Doo one. I'm still trying to figure out if he looks more like Epstein or Horshack.
1,This monitor is bad,"I bought this item but it is not working, amazon sent me other but this item is bad too. You can't see completely the number (blood pressure) in the screen."
1,mislead,"This perfume, Inferno Paradiso Pink, does not smell anything like it was described by the manufacturer.It smells so bad, like cheap, strong cologne. It smells so awful I had to throw it out. I feel tricked and very dissatisfied. Shame on you Bennetton !"
4,Works good as a key ring,"Knife blade very functional. Don't know yet how well the blade will hold an edge. Carabiner seems well put-together. One more small, straight-slot screw driver would have been nice. Internal opening needs to be about 3/4"" wider to form a better handle. I really like the finger contours. A hole at the base would have also been nice to secure keys from sliding up and down the gate (maybe in place of the bottle opener). Overall, I like it and carry it everyday as my key ring."
5,A gem.,"Like most of the reviewers, I first heard The Dillards on ""The Andy Griffith Show"" and for years never thought of them until Nick at Night began running the show again. I bought this particular cd because it has ""There is a Time"" on it and I can still see Charlene and the boys singing this in Andy's living room.I was overwhelmed by how much I like the whole album. From ""Copperfields"" to the end of the album appeal more to me than some of the others. ""She Sang Hymns Out of Tune"" entranced me and maybe enchanted me too. I think many of us who became politically aware in the '60s will have a real connection to this album.All in all it's a treasure."
1,Don't waste your money,"This is one of the worst books on poker I have ever read. Patrick jumps from one topic to the next, without concentrating on anything long enough to offer any insight. This book reads like the trancript of an hour long speech about poker that you could hear in any card room. If it took longer than a day to write this, I'd be surprised. No matter what your skill level, your money can be better spent on something else."
1,Another stinker from John Patrick,"As usual, Patrick doesn't know what he's talking about. He totally ignores anything related to the mathematics of the game. His advice on not chasing is particularly bad...if you're getting odds to chase, go hunt your opponent down. In the long run, you'll be glad you did.I could name a dozen authors and over fifty books I would recommend before this one...no, check that: I would NEVER recommend this book, under any circumstances. Get a Jones or Krieger book, and build from there."
1,"Good topic, poorly written","The topic of this novel seemed very intriguing to me, but Ms. Toth blew it. Her inability to give the book any sort of flow ruined this book for me. She jumps all over the place making the book seem like a series of short stories....and not very good ones."
2,Homeless people don't like this book,"Well, it's great that Toth brought attention to this aspect of American life. People who have never experienced such things as discribed in this book are intrigued. It's funny, though, that people who have experienced this kind of life first hand say that Toth is off the mark. I really liked the book, Moby Dick, but I've never been whaling before."
4,Extremly Interesting,"I don't usually read non-fiction, but i couldn't put this book down. More amazing than the actual book is the fact that it's completely true. A very easy read and very well done."
4,Watch Out...,"They'll eat you alive. The only time in my life I've ever been directly threatened was by a mole person. They're obviously all evil, demonic creatures, as evidenced by the films ""Devil's Advocate"" and ""Jacob's Ladder."""
1,gdprewsr,"I had never used a GPS before I bought the Navcam 7000. All I can say is this thing made me feel very stupid. I couldn't get it to find well known streets in Austin, Texas. It simply ignored my requests without telling me it couldn't find the locations. It locks up constantly, and has to be reset, and re-started from scratch.My son has a Garmin 350 that works the way I thought the Navcam 7000 should have. After using the Garmin I realized it wasn't me who had a lack of ability; it is the Navcam 7000 that is a failure!!!!The only thing good I can say about it is IT LOOKS PRETTY!!!!!"
5,Diane Mott Davidson is the best writer!,"I have read almost all of Ms. Davidsons books and all are wonderful. They are funny, suspensiful and just plain good books."
3,Good but not her best,"We follow caterer Goldie Bear as she walks into an attorneys office to cater a breakfast and instead spills her bread dough all over a corpse. And away we go as Goldie searches for the killer. Her husband Tom, law enforcement officer in the small Colorado town, helps & tries to protect her while in the background of the story her son is going through his teens."
2,Disappointed,I enjoyed the last book very much. I thought it was great that the author took a chance and made a major change in the basic plot of the series. So I was really looking forward to reading this one. I was very disappointed. The plot moved at a really slow pace. And the author did not make one reference to the major change in Goldy's life after the last book.
3,Just ok,I've read all of the Goldy series but the books are getting less and less interesting. The same things keep happening time and again and it's just not entertaining anymore. There are too many recaps of what has happened so far and the recipes aren't as much a part of the story when relegated to the back of the book. I think I'm going to have to pass on the next book in the series which is disappointing.
3,Not one of her best.,"I have read all the books in this series and have always enjoyed them. They are quick, light and fast read. But this one made me feel like I had skipped a couple of pages or missed something in the last book. The introduction of the Charlie Baker character had me skipping back through the pages, I had know idea who he was and Davidson wrote it like we should all be familar with him????Then as the story unfolded she started to explain who he was, but more of that should have been done in the beginning. The Routt family were more annoying then sympathetic. The psator character wasn't developed enough.I think I cared less about the characters then in the past and there were too many of them and her usual characters (Marla, her son) were shoved in here in there to fill in."
3,The ingredients don't come together,"With this 13th book, It's starting to feel like DMD is just hacking them out and running out of interesting things to do. The Goldy series has always been enjoyable, with likable characters and fun twists and turns. While not terrible, this one just didn't quite come together for me. The story plodded along and did't build up to an interestingg resolution. There was no growth or real interest for any of the ongoing supporting characters. Compared to previous books, Marla, Tom, Julian and especially Arch seemed pretty lifeless this time out. Fans of the Goldy of previous books will probably be disappointed."
2,Don't waste your time,This item arrived in a box that looked like it'd already been opened and shoved back in for re-sale. The paints that came with it were all rock hard and did not soften when water was added. It comes with a tiny squeeze tube with glue in it that isn't enough to put on all the beads. The glue was watered down or something because it was very soupy and didn't work for holding on the beads.
5,A glimpse of a beautiful painting slips away......,"How can it be said; Amazing, Brilliant, one of the most deverse mcd too be created in a long time. Autumn Tears have returned with three songs that will once again enchant you with the the spell of Autumn the Beautiful. But now enters a new character called Winter; beware of her soft caress. This mcd is just a taste of whats too come when they release there new full length cd called ""Winter and the Broken Angel"" later this year."
3,Not Her Best,"Not bad...but not her best. I've read all of her contemporary novels and loved a few enough to keep and reread often, particularly my favorite Hunter's Moon. The Midnight Hour lacked a lot of romantic tension that her other books seem to have because she did not include the hero's voice in any significant way until almost halfway through the book. He's just a secondary character for far too long. Another major sore point for me was the stalkers viewpoint...unfortunately it read like an older person trying to think young and angry. Pretty trite and unimaginative...very unconvincing...and not very scary either. I guess I'm a little closer to an age when I can still vividly rememeber the angst and anger of being a teenager, so in particular this character came across to me as very forced. But she threw some good plot twists in at the end to keep the reader thinking. Not bad...but not her best!"
5,Great Collection,"It's great to listen to each of these cds with lots of well-known artists. I have now listened to 36 and loved each. If you're a Shakespeare fan, this is a must!"
4,too cool for words,A cool refrigerator cool wind that refreshes and reminds the mind and the soul that sounds and words and memories and hopes will fly together.A definite way to go back and be before all the sadness and the mistakes.Great and Great again.drat
2,it is just like the rest,I wanted CD's I could listen to in the car. It only gives you one. The voice teacher is not bad sounding. The program that is on the computer is just like all the rest.
2,Much darker than you'd expect.,"This book is not your typical ""it's up to these 3 misfits to save the world"" book, even though that's what it claims to be. Nobody ever smiles or has a happy thought in the whole 500+ pages and nothing good happens to anyone, except living a few more hours in a miserable place or deciding not to kill yourself - this time. There is an excessive use of flashbacks, and nothing good happens in them either. About the only positive thing you can say about this book is that it's different."
1,A Waste of Trees,"I'm a little shocked at the other reviews I'm reading here. This may be the single WORST fantasy book I've ever read, and I've read some lulus. The characters are woefully shallow and unimaginative. The plot is predictable and unbelievable (yes, yes, I know... but I mean even for fantasy). The writing style has all of the polish and elegance of a blow to the head.As far as 'dark fantasy' is concerned, this story seems to attempt a dark atmosphere simply by portraying shocking scenes, and it overdoes it on this front. One becomes accoustomed to it halfway through, and there's nothing else to hold the book up.If you want good dark fantasy, try Glenn Cook's Black Company series. I'm filing this one under 'Trash'."
3,Not as good as previously thought,"Fast shipping, excellent fit, so easy to put on that I can take them off/on at will. Fully adjustable, durable plastic cover with glass mirror. Leaves the OEM mirror open for use. Much better than drilling holes in the door for mounts.10-25-12 Bought last January, but now that I've used it I'm disappointed in quality of the glass. It distorts the reflection so objects aren't clearly visible. The mirror also vibrates which causes further distortion. Can't tighten it up any more. Works ok for seeing a blurry object but cannot use for backing up. Bought 2, one is better than other."
4,Handle made in China,"Seller product is a good product; however, I noticed a sticker on the bottom of the handle stating made in China. I thought the complete axe (axe head and handle) was made in USA. Item is still a good product and handles very well."
2,On the Dull Side,"I'm quite a fan of British Police Procedurals; however, this is the first book I've read in the Gil Mayo series. Other than his daughter disappearing there doesn't seem to be a lot of exciting things happening in Gil Mayo's life. In fact the town itself seems a bit on the dull side. It's hard to get worked up about the rather pedestrian antics and cardboard cut-out family dysfunctions that resulted in the death of a young girl-- the mystery is very guessable.This book is probably ok if there isn't anything else new on the shelf from a better writer."
4,Nice but not plush,"Use these for the clear bra I have on my car. It is excellent and I do not fear that it will scratch car. I gave it 4 stars only because it is not as plush as I expected, but still a think it is great."

3,"Good rare stuff, but better track coordination needed.",Defintiely like JEANNIE by Thrashers. I originally bought 45 on MASON's red vinyl for $1 back in '61 at Slim's (Times Sq. Records - NYC). Reproduction great on CD.
4,"Well worth it, bicyclist or not.","This was easy for me to pick up being a cyclist myself. I don't ride across states, but I've been on a bike enough to relate and appreciate these stories. Metal Cowboy is a really fun read, with most chapters only taking ten minutes to get through. Joe not only has many adventures worth hearing about, he has a great sense of humor, and good delivery.Obviously anybody with a bike should enjoy this book, but really it's about life as much as it is coasting down the road. There are some real true statements and deep thoughts within. Highly recommended!"
5,Sweet and simple,"Finally, a flat and condense book that sums up the important points of feng shui. I like it. I wish Amazon.com would ship it to India for cheaper."
2,Did India approve this?,"Maybe I'm just being a music snob...this was very amaturish smooth jazz and didn't hit me at all. I wasn't really sure what to expect but was hoping it would be some great interpretations of one of my favorite songstresses, something you'd hear in a smokey jazz club at night. I found the saxaphone to be screechy and annoying after about the third song. For those out there that love smooth jazz with a heavy on the sax sound, you will probably like this. I will try and listen to it again later, maybe it was my mood? All in all I got what I paid for (got it for under $1 plus shipping) so can't complain too much."
1,Huge waste of money.,"Its just four little plastic straws. Come on! Thought'd be useful. :'( We don't have money to waste, and feel way ripped off!"
3,Best Tracks Now Better on Different Album,"The version of ""We Got To Get Out of This Place"" on this album is indeed a mess, but that's because it's a butchered, shortened version of the whole live performance, which can now be heard on *The Best of the Frost,* which, despite its title, consists of the live tracks from the Grande Ballroom not included on this record. If you dig Dick Wagner -- and hard-rock-guitar nuts certainly should -- the so-called Best of is the place to hear him stretch out with the Frost. ""We Got To Get Out of This Place"" is 17 minutes long on that record -- but it finally makes sense!"
2,BH&G Home Designer Not Deluxe,"I have found this this to have a very confusing interface with poor documentation. You have to know the ""series"" of icons to push in order to accomplish anything. Interestingly, BH&G does not even have a referenece to the program on their own website. In today's world of sorftware design I expect more and sometimes get less. This is one of those examples. For the money, there are much better programs out there."
2,Disappointed,"This software is very hard to use. The help video goes too fast, the manual doesn't cover everything and nothing is intuitive. I have used a lot of software and this is just not worth the money."
1,Very disappointed with B H & G Home Designer Deluxe,"I'm good with computers and have used other architectural software, and this was most disappointing. In fact, if I had not bought this on Amazon, I would have returned it to the local retail store with huge complaints. It was difficult to install--buggy. It had problems rendering a drawing and would often lock up. The ""objects"" that you pull from its library can sometimes be opened and resized--and sometimes cannot. Hardly intuitive at all. Also disappointing was the way multiple stories did not synch up. I had reasonable expectations for this software, but wish I had bought something else. For $10 it would be a good purchase. For anything over that, you are wasting your money. Try another product, a demo first, or something. But in my opinion this was a big waste of money."
3,Did the job at a reasonable price,"Used it to design my kitchen. Biggest problem was the complex roof lines with cathedral ceilings only supported on higher priced Pro version. The walls floors, furniture and cabinet design features were acceptable to do layout, lighting and color analysis. When I was done and placed a copy of the design against a photo of the finished kitchen from most views you almost couldn't tell the difference except for the gaps in the ceilings and fabric selections.This is mouse intensive like most CAD program. WOuld be nice if there were more contemporary kitchen furniture options.Could not do curved or overhanging counters.Good for the homeowner doing layout before a renovation. You can get a sense of what different elements will look like in your space."
4,obscure little title,"Not many people have played this game, which is a shame as it's one of the best horror games on playstation. Definitely superior to the Resident Evil series in terms of fear. Probably the 2nd best ""scary"" game after Silent Hill. The graphics aren't anything special...there's rarely music,and there's only a couple cut scenes, but who cares? It's a solid point and click game. Good list of characters, and you'd be surprised at who Scissorman turns out to be. There's some really cool scenes in here like when you're in an abandoned office building and it's all quiet and suddenly all the computers flash ""DIE"" and you see the killer at the end of a long hallway. You should probably put on a David Bowie CD or something while playing this because of the lack of sound. The cover is wrong."
5,Don't make them like this anymore...,"Clock Tower is a great survival horror game for the playstation. It's different than Resident Evil, very different. You do not shoot, stab, or blow anything up. You run and hide!This series actually predates Resident Evil...but followed Alone in the Dark and Sweet Home. (Japan only game from Capcom.)I love this game because it can be intense, running from Scissor man. The controls are click and point and take a little getting used to but overall this game is up there with Resident Evil 1, Resident Evil 2 and Silent Hill as one of the best in the survival horror genre."
3,A good game,"There are a few ""Dead Ends"" in this game. (That's funny if you've played it.) What I mean is that you find yourself cornered by the madman Scissorman and killed. However, the point of the game is to evade the killer while picking up clues that will reveal his identity. Is he just a sick human being? Or is Scissorman some supernatural evil?Sometimes the game will have you begging for a save point where you must successfully run from Scissorman several times before you can escape or find help.Overall, the game will probably satisfy people who enjoy thrillers and games like Resident Evil or Fatal Frame. It is a race to find the critical clues. However, it is a cursor-moving game. You do not have free three-D movement as I thought you would. Rather, you use a cursor for movement.It's not that bad a game."
2,Document regurgitation,"For an individual who was as interesting as John Paul Jones, this book does the person an injustice. The vast majority of the book contains copies of letters sent and received by JPJ with little or no analysis or summary comment added by the author. By far its the most boring book on an 18th century patriot that I've ever read. Its actually more a book on the topic of ship building in early New England times and less on the individual and his military accomplishments. I'm sure the time spent for the necessary research to garner the materials is laudable, but I purchased the book to understand the man and his character in confronting the enemy at home and abroad. Although the book is relatively inexpensive, there are numerous books on others such as Daniel Morgan, etc which are worth reading more than once. Sorry if this review offends anyone."
3,cover is deceiving,This CD was okay but I ordered it thinking it was about construction vehicles (hence the cover photo). The majority of the video features water crafts. I also ordered the Mighty Machines Diggers And Dozers which was much more of what I was looking for.
4,Sweet!!!,"Danny Weis Sweet Spot is a great addition to any jazz lovers collection. Mixing smooth jazz with funk and bits of R&B instrumentals, the result is a warm, interesting, listenable album. For fans of Danny's previous work, (Iron Butterfly, Rhinoceros) Sweet Spot really shows how he has matured as an artist and songwriter over the years."
1,more politics than weather,"This book was a waste of my time. It is about the politics of the Weather Channel. It is about the politics of the Bush administration. It is about the politics of global warming. But, oh yes, they did chase a storm, however, the northern storm they chased only produced rain, the other chase teams went for the southern storm which actually produced tornadoes. Save yourself some money and pass on this book.A greatly disappointed reader.me"
2,Hokey & Cheesy,I received my first issue in the mail and lets say I was very unimpressed. It is very hokey and the projects are really cheesy and had way too many ads. I'm glad it is only 6 issues and I only paid $5.00 for the subscription.
2,90/10,"A few of the ideas are good. A few of the articles are interesting. The others are ""You've got to be kidding me!"" and ""Duh!"" Maybe if you have young children who need craft projects to keep them busy there would be more of use.Whenever I get my issue I wind up sifting through it looking for the one good thing that *might* be in the issue. I no longer expect any more than that. I'm sure it is extremely difficult to keep coming up with new and interesting things for each issue but rather than put in so much lame filler they should just put out fewer magazines per year. I won't be renewing my subscription."
2,Not what I was thinking of,"I am a do it yourselfer type gal, and I thought this was more on the line of a Do It Yourself magazine. It does have some good articles, but not what I was looking for. At first glance, I would not buy it again. I have only received first issue - we'll see !"
5,For the all-around creative type...,"This is the magazine for you!!! I just got my first issue and the projects were AWESOME! It ranged from no-brainer crafts that you can actually make money with, to home furnishing! Plus, it's up to date...not your grandma's or even your mother's craft book! I love this thing and I can't wait to get home and try the projects!!!"
1,Outrageous price!,"I have some of these bowls and love them. I use them for serving food, rather than actually eating out of them. However, the price they have here is 3x the cost for it at a store. 5 stars for the bowl, 1 star for the outrageous price!"
4,Good for little ones,"I ordered this book for my two year old son, who was fascinated by Spiderman ever since Spidey made the cover of Newsweek a few weeks ago. The artwork walks the line between the gritty look of the comic book and a ""nicer"" kids book artwork. This predates the movie, so it's not just another marketing tool. He loves it and it allows me to share Spiderman without having to share the scarey villians."
4,Great Book to make the transition from WordBasic to VBA,The beginning of the book was a nice review of basic programming that leads into more detail in the end.Since the Word flavor of VBA is so new this is the best book so far.If you are making a move from the old WordBasic to VBA this book will help you out - but in the end you will end up using the VB online help for the reference due to the nature of the book.This book also does a good job of bringing the advantages of VBA over WordBasic to your attention.It really is a must buy (due to being one of the few books on the subject)
2,Not enough depth,"This is a rather disappointing reference to me. I am a VB programmer and bought this book hoping this gives some details about the Word Object Model. Unfortunately this only go as far as the online help pages, which are very supervisual as well. This book failed to give the 'secrets' of Word tricks, and a lot of them I had to learn them the hard way.I also read a couple other references but they weren't too good either. Maybe experienced Office developers don't tend to write to well usually."
2,Pretty good book--NOT!!!,"This is a pretty good book if you're just learning how to read. However, if you're seven years old or older, I'd recommend you skip the first 805 pages of the book. I would recommend it to a blind neighbor."
2,Sorry Bob,"I love his songs, I love his lyrics, but Tarantula is basically a bunch of words and really bizarre sotires that do not go anywhere. I kinda expected better from him since his songs were so great."
1,Little Tykes Explorer Wagon,"I bought this wagon for my 4 1/2 year old. The first one I received, the sides did not fit into the base properly. On the second wagon, the holes in the wagon base (where the wagon and the handle are connected with a steel rod) were not drilled in a straight line. The handle could not be attached. Needless to say, it also went back. I am a fan of Little Tykes, but I am not a fan of this wagon. One being returned is understandable. Two being returned means I will find another wagon. Tighter specs would have solved the problems."
3,Slight fitment issue,"The large 4-5"" holes don't quite line up with the lip of the strut tower holes - the driver's side is off by about 1/8"" which needs to be ground out."
4,"The Frost -- Frost Music is very ""cool""!!!","This is a quintessential album from one of the great Detroit rock bands from the late 1960's, early 1970's. They have a certain sound that is very unique and their songs tell many a tale through great chords and lyrics. I love to put this CD on and press the 'repeat' button and let it play over and over again. I never tire of hearing these great tunes!"
5,Great CD,"I have the priv. of knowing 3 of the 4 band members, and still remain close to two of them.. their music was b4 my time (sorry guys), they continue to do reunion concerts that pack the ppl in. If you like classic rock, this CD is a must have, along with their greatest hits. They need to put out another CD, Don and Bobs vocals remain as strong today as they did back then, if not more improved and refined."
1,BORING!!!!!!!,I didn't like it because it was [slow]. It didn't have action. I thought it was WAY too short. The author could have improved by making a ending that had more action. It clearly was more of a love and sentimental book. Thank you.
4,Satisfied,"This is great, only minor problem is that the bottome hole does not line up to charge the mp3 player. I have to take it out of the case to charge it. Other than that it is fine & offers great protection for falls."
