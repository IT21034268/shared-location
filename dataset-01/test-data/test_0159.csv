4,Groovy!,"Director Sam Raimi is one of the greatest visual stylists working in American films, and Bruce Campbell deserves to be one of our biggest movie stars. Not for horror fans looking to be scared -- more of a hilarious spoof of horror films. END"
1,EVIL DEAD II: DEAD BY DAWN (BOOK OF THE DEAD: LIMITED EDITION) DETAILS,"Near the end of September, a new special edition of the 1987 horror film EVIL DEAD II will be released, packaged in an attractive Book of the Dead case. Here is the details:Audio Commentary with Sam Raimi, Bruce Campbell, Scott Spiegel and Greg Nicotero""Evil Dead 2: Behind the Screams"" Featurette""The Gore, The Merrier"" FeaturettePoster and Still GallerySam Raimi BiographyBruce Campbell BiographyTheatrical trailersAlso, the front cover will have a pressable eyeball, which will scream when pressed.I'm sure this will improve over the original edition. Of course, I dislike EVIL DEAD II, because I don't find it interesting and the performances are rather over-the-top."
5,Most fun movie ever made,"What can i say about this movie that hasn't already been said a thousand times over? An absolute classic, regardless of which genre you place it in. The blu-ray picture quality is only a slight improvement over the standard DVD version, but if you don't own it already you might as well go with the blu-ray version. this is a MUST OWN movie!"
4,Boom,"Evil Dead 2 is a marked improvement over its predecessor in every way. Director Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell created one of the most memorable horror icons when they introduced the 'boomstick'. Equal parts shocking and hilarious, this sequel is evidence of a director who knew how to push the right buttons in his audience."
3,'SOUTHERN EXPOSURE',"Based on the novel by Carson McCullers, and directed by John Huston [quite a bold subject-choice at that time], and starring Elizabeth Taylor, Marlon Brando, Julie Harris, Brian Keith, set in a Military Academy 'somewhere down South' it's a lonely story about self-mutilation, unfulfilled love, stereotypes, equine apttitude, voyeurism and more ......Robert Forster is the object of distant affection, a young private on this base with an aptitude for riding bareback [a scene not deleted, but strangely 'blurred' by vigilant censors abroad].Grand score by Toshiro Mayuzumi [who also collaborated with Huston on ""The Bible""].McCullers knew the lonely heart - Huston's work was initiallycondemned [just too many 'perversions'] but deserves to be fully restored to DVD glory in wide-screen.Great companion to ""Death in Venice"".Also features a young Harvey Keitel on the base!"
5,REFLECTIONS IN A GOLDEN EYE,EXCELLENT OFFBEAT STORY WITH GREAT PERFORMANCES BY ELIZABETH TAYLOR AND MARLON BRANDO AND JULIE HARRIS.
4,Pretty in Pink,"I bought this for my wife, it is white with pink embroiderie. Very nice summer sleepwear. The big advantage is stylish, without having a string up your butt."
3,Sex Pistols - 'Raw' (Music Club International),"Not sure if this archive disc is from the soundboard or just a home bootleg tape recording.Either way,it does have a few flaws but in my opinion,it suits it's purpose well.The gig apparently took place somewhere in September 1976.Better cuts are the opener ""Anarchy In The UK"",""I Wanna Be Me"",a cover of The Who's ""Substitute"",""No Fun"" and ""Pretty Vacant"".Must admit it's a true privilege to hear a 'real' live vintage audio document of the classic line-up of Rotten/Jones/Matlock/Cook.There are four bonus tracks tagged on,some rather raw-sounding(what else?)demos,including one of ""God Save The Queen"".This is a budget priced CD,although I believe it's aimed toward collectors and Sex Pistols completists."
4,Not Actually A Review...As Much As It Is A Question...,First of all i would like to say that i love watching Angel...this is only my opinion...but i think its better then Buffy...well the last 3 seasons atleast...any way...I live in Australia...and have bought HEAPS of DVDs off Amazon...but i dont know any where that you can just ask a question about a product...so im using this to do so...Any way...here is my question...here in Australia...we have the Angel and Buffy seasons in 2 part single Amerays...(single dvd cases)...so 3 discs to an ameray...and i have all my others like this...im a bit of a collector...and i just need to know...is this Angel season 5 box set in a 2 part single ameray or is it like the other ones...and in an actual fold out box...?PsSorry for using this review system to ask a question...
1,What Happened?,"What happened, Joss? Did you lose your fricken mind? I can't believe how awful this season was. I had to actually FORCE myself to watch. The only reason I'm giving this season a star at all is for two episodes: ""You're Welcome"" and ""Origin""I used to be OBSESSED with Angel and now, after seeing season 5, I can't even watch an episode of it or Buffy. I even sold all of my dvds to blockbuster. I honestly can't stomach any episodes knowing that they ruined some of the best characters television has ever created.Save your money people and buy something worth your time 24 or Nip/Tuck. I honestly can't believe what a disapointment this season was."
5,A reviewer from Canada,"A wonderfully insightful book, I will read it again and again. It reveals a deep understanding of life and the way to become a content person. This book is very quotable and really made me think about my life. I loved it!"
2,Disappointed..,"The bamboo looks nothing like the picture. I received a yellow, already dying plant. When I complained I was sent a new plant free of charge. However, this one came even worse than the first. I had to throw half of it out because it was already dead. I am trying to salvage what remains and nurse it back to health. So far it isn't looking promising. I will not be buying plants online anymore!"
5,Hallucinatory,"Quasimoto is Madlib's strange alter ego with a nasal, high-pitched voice. This hallucinatory album wends its way through 24 blink-and-they're-gone tracks, covering some truly random subject material. Dusty, lo-fi production holds it all together. Repeated listening (and perhaps a packed bowl) is required for full appreciation."
5,genius,"Okay,okay,okay first of all let's start with the first primitive step's producer alter ego madlib quasimoto made this album in a week,it's conception flowered under the influence of psilocybin blue i mean really one week of binging on mushrooms produced something like this??? whether or not i should take this as some form of advice in innovative creation or whether anyone one should is irrespective of how this definitely rates as one of the best underground head boppers aroundcan't recommend it enough CHEERS MADLIB GOOD EXPERIENCES"
1,No AM radio!!!!,"I bought this little radio to listen to some Jim Rome while working in the mornings... Big problem, the AM receiver doesn't work! I am able to listen only to FM radio stations, but AM does not receive one single station... If you want this as an FM radio by all means get it... But useless as an AM radio..."
1,No FM,"I needed a tiny radio just to listen to NPR on FM radio when I'm out walking. Guess what! No FM! None at all. The AM comes in nicely, at least for just a few stations, but I don't want AM stations! Too much advertising. NPR is fine on my house radios, but something is wrong with this piece of junk. Don't buy it. You can't depend on Coby to supply a dependable product."
5,My Favorite Jackson Browne Album!,I'm a Jackson Browne Fan since the 70s & this is my favorite! I love Sleep's Dark and Silent Gate and The Pretender!www.pictureperfectphotorestoration.net
3,"A good, but not great effort by Jackson Browne","I feel that any of JB's first three albums surpass this one. If you liked them, I'm afraid this will come as a bit of a let down. Perhaps it was the profound loss he had suffered, perhaps it was a desire to be more ""popular"" but this album just doesn't have the edge that his previous work did. Two cuts from this album, however, stand with his best - the title song and ""Your Bright Baby Blues."""
5,Great video,"My son can not get enough of this video, he loves Elmo, and this is a good adition to his videos collection"
1,Very disappointed,"If you own Elmo's world ""singing and drawing,"" don't bother ordering this one. It is pretty much the same video!"
5,Depends Fitted Briefs withstood our test! We had ...,Depends Fitted Briefs withstood our test! We had NO nighttime leaks. Other products that we've used so far have always eventually leaked. We're pleased with this product and will recommend it to others looking for a nighttime diaper system for bigger children or adults.
2,Not a brief,"perhaps I don't know what a brief is but this is not constructed like a pair of underpants (as the daytime depends are), but rather as a diaper where you have to secure the sides. As the patient is not confined to a bed, such a design is not appropriate and difficult to put on the patient."
2,Mixed Bag Comes Up a Little Empty,"Excellent physical quality and about as non-stick as it gets, but I just can't warm up :-) to this set. Handle grips are too far out, there are too many sharp edges. This set is designed for cute, not comfort. The frying pan (purchased separately) is rather shallow. Not having a 3-qt pot is quite inconvenient, I've found.I like the dark charcoal exterior. Interiors are very easy to clean."
5,My Favorite Pans,"This is a wonderful set of cookware. I wanted a decent set of hard anodized pans without the high price, and this set is perfect. The pans are as heavy (and in some cases heavier) as the premium brands, and they look beautiful. They do require a little extra care, but they are well worth it."
2,Very Plastic Looking,I have ordered other plants but this particular one is very plastic looking when placed next to the others. very disappointed.
4,a pleasure for reading,"I've found it a pleasure for reading and, what is more, very interesting and useful for my work."
2,Marc Behrens - Final Ballet,"Be forewarned: M. Behrens' FINAL BALLET is very minimal, perhaps too minimal for some. It was certainly for me. Stripped of everything but the percussion, the tracks seem almost faceless. The chugging of ""Scene 1"" doesn't feel qualitatively different from the whirring of ""Scene 2."" ""Scene 4"" has slightly more structure and interest, but not quite enough. ""Scene 5"" fills in more of this promise, but it's almost too little, too late, and ""Scene 7"" returns to... nothing, really. Can't say this album grabbed me."
3,stand shorter than stated,The stand for saw was shorter than stated. I built a table for saw for the cut material before saw arrived based on specifications but table was to short had to take apart and rebuild. The saw itself is powerful and easy to use. Worth the money and extra time.
1,boring,his voice is alright but the material is very weak.nothing original or special at all.johnny gill lite is the best way to describe him.
4,cool cd,i think dat sweet lady and lately are good but not exactly d other stuff.I hope he isn't insulted but i want to let him know dat his cd is cool
1,Not for this DUMMY!,"This DUMMY found this book--totally WORTHLESS!!!I can work with ACCESS reasonably well,but I simply could not understand what the heckthese authors were trying to say.I could have used a copy of Rosetta-Stone's--TechnoSpeak!I was so disappointed, depressed and confused,that after struggling for a week or so,I gave up the ghost--went out and hired a freelancer to do the programming for me!"
3,bought the wrong book,did not realize that this was for programing. Returned it and bought the real Access dummies workbook to start with instead.
4,easy to use and too handy,i like this a lot too easy to use and too handy.. only i use it few times and i left it at the opera house. i need to buy another one..
1,Not Very Useful,"The ""course"" is essentially just a pair of people saying words and sentences. There is no explanation of sentence structure, words, or anything. The language used is also very rigid and formal, which is of dubious usefulness. The whole thing feels like it was made from a template: take a number of English sentences, have someone read them in another language, and sell the tapes.One highlight: it's pretty comical to hear people reading the Hindi words for ""beef,"" ""pork,"" ""bacon,"" ""steak,"" and ""raspberry.""American Narrator: ""Beef.""Hindi Narrator: ""Beef.""American Narrator: ""Pork.""Hindi Narrator: ""Pork.""And so on.Considering that the only place you likely could order pork is in an Amercian hotel, it hardly seems worth the trouble to tell me how to say it in Hindi. However, I now know how to say, ""Can I use the photocopier?"" I really don't know what else I would need."
3,Pan and Scan only.,"While the movie is entertaining family fare, DVD purchasers should be aware this is a pan and scan only release. Those expecting the theatrical format will be disappointed."
5,This film totally EXCEEDED my already GREATexpectations!,"This movie is a kind of movie I haven't seen in a LONG time! My ENTIRE family enjoyed it...including my grandmother! We were lauging during millions of parts!Frankie Muniz was an awesome actor picked for the role of Jason Sheperd-a 14-year old boy who's God-given talent is making up stories. Amanda Bynes...what can I say? Great acting talent, a really pretty face...who else could have been picked for this role and play it perfectly? No one else! Paul Giamatti was H-I-L-A-R-I-O-U-S! Playing a really annoying villain who was covered in BLUE color dye for more than one scene. This movie was really great! Tears will be streaming down your cheeks for laughing so hard! That's not hyperbole! For those who haven't seen this amazingly fun family film,you're definetely missing something great!This movie will appeal to movie-goers of any age! From 7 years of age to movie-goers who are 75!"
1,Save Your Money!,"Simply stated, this is one of the worst movies in recent years. Save your hard-earned ticket money for something else."
3,"You can take it from me, the truth is overrated and this movie is so overracted!","Frankie Muniz stars as Jason Shepherd (yes, Shepherd), but it can also be named Cody Banks or Malcolm, as he always acts the same. So cliché.Amanda Bynes doesn't even acts in this film, she is just TERRIBLE.Paul Giamatti is excellent as always, perfect timing and few words just perfect acting. (Something for the Trivia Book is that in this movie he co-stars Sandra Oh,just like in Sideways by Alexander Payne)Something quite remarkable of this film is that the script is quite clever, still the ""trust issue"" is the same than in 59 other movies. (what a way to destroy what could have been a great film for kids and a great one for adults also)"
2,Big Fat Nothing,"Take some talented actors and put them in an age old story of smart kids versus dumb adults and you get more of the same. Really, is this the type of movie we want to pawn off on our kids? They deserve better.The key point of this movie is that lying is bad. Good point. A device used to bring out the truth is creative pranks. Also good. Unfortunately, the pranks fall flat as they are totally implausible (even kids will have a hard time believing a man can't tell he's been dyed blue until he looks in the mirror), and since they are the device used to bring the movie to its conclusion, the entire thing falls flat.Making films for children is a fine thing. They shouldn't be dumbed down or even given an uncritical eye just because they are for children, however. Quite honestly, I'd rather have a kid watch something like ""Good Will Hunting"" before this.Don't waste your children's time with this film. Read them a book ... a good book ... instead."
2,"Beautiful knobs, but not built for the long haul","I bought 25 of these almost 3 years ago for my kitchen remodel. I now have something like 8 of them that have broken. The acrylic crystal part has a bad habit of detaching from the nickel base with frequent use. Some literally pulled straight off. Had I known that these knobs had such an inherent weakness, I would have never bought so many. I am now shopping for new knobs that are made as a single piece.These knobs are beautiful, but not for a kitchen that actually gets used."
4,Tote for work,"Use it to carry stuff for work, works very well. The price couldn't be beat. I have had it for a while. It washes well and is holding up through all the dragging around it goes through. I will buy another."
5,great,I go to a lot of tractor pull functions and carry a lot of stuff with me and this keeps every thing neat
4,Great for Beach,I used this bag as a carry on and a beach bag. The only thing I missed was an inside pocket.
1,Disappointed,"Product much larger than it looks in the picture. Which for some would be considered a positive but, not for me. Way too big for what I need it for. My main issue is, in less than a week the zipper no longer worked. No matter which way I zip the bag is still open. Poor quality, understand it's cheap but should last longer then a week."
1,Cheap and flimsy,"Can't understand why shipping was more than the price of the bag. This flimsy little bag couldn't weigh over 3 or 4 ounces and could easily have been put in an envelope and mailed parcel post for just over a dollar. Guess that's where the seller makes the profit. Was going to put things in the tote and give as a gift, but think I'll just use a paper gift bag instead. The tote won't really add a lot. Color is pretty. That's about all I can say that's positive."
4,Soul Coughing: Addictive (in a good way),"Soul Coughing's new album rates only 4 stars because it comes after Irrestible Bliss. The group will never top the rocking synchopated beat of ""Super Bon-Bon."" But, the synthesizer samples and cool drums are classic SC. I bought El Oso thinking that it would be another IR, it wasn't. The album is good in its own right, from the addictive ""Circles"" to the weirdly cool ""So Far I have not found the Science."" I say for anyone who liked Ruby Vroom or Irresstible Bliss, get El Oso. Do it and record all the tunes on a tape or minidisk and take it everywhere with you. Share with your friends, they'll love you for it."
2,yuck,"Ruby Vroom is one of the Top Five CDs of the decade. This is not. I never thought Id hear a bland Soul Coughing CD but thats what we have here: Relentlessly bland music that just sits there like Matchbox 20 with better drumming. On the plus side, there is one brilliant song here, the dazzling ""I Miss the Girl"" which twists and turns and snakes around, taking you to unexpected places. But thats it. Just ONE. ONE GREAT SONG! From these guys, I expected much much more."
2,"Oh, the pain....","If what you like about Soul Coughing is meaningless choruses repeated over and over with funky baselines, you will be pleased. But for anyone else out there who bought into this band for the unmatched $%*#%^&! BRILLIANCE of the narrative beat-poet lyrics on ""Ruby Vroom"", I'm sorry to tell you that ""El Oso"" is yet another step down. Another casualty of popularity."
3,So so...,"I'm sorry to say this, this El Oso is just ain't what I expected from Soul Coughing. Their previous albums ""irrestible bliss"" + ""ruby vroom"" were great, but this one ain't impressive. Vocal is still good, bass is still cool, but overall, this CD doesn't sound right."
4,Another bout with reality!,"The recent release of El Olso is yet another example of Soul Coughing's continued bout with reality. Musically, while showcasing SC's ability to meld syncopated rhythms with non-enharmonic arrangements, this release does have a ""darker"" feel to it then the up-beat Ruby Vroom and Irresistible Bliss CDs. I don't suggest listening to this if you're depressed or if you have trouble with ""attitude"" music. Overall this CD leaves me slightly hyper and even a bit edgy. I like this CD!"
5,wanted to read it before i saw the movie,it was a wonderful book! it is indeed snow white and the seven dwarfs with a twist. it was delightful!
2,boooooring!,"Mirror, Mirror is definately a FAR cry from Wicked. This book has surely been one of the worst books i've read all year. I had to FORCE myself to read it... hoping it would get better.Everything was TOO obnoxiously descriptive. it's good to know what something looks like and the dwarves' mannerisms and whatnot... but please! sheesh...but hey, if you're having a hard time falling to sleep at night, pick up this book! sure to work."
3,"Good idea, not delivered well","I feel that Maguire, in all of his novels, makes the reader think about different perspectives on classic stories in a way that is refreshing and intelligent. Unfortunately, ""Mirror Mirror"" was not as great as all of his other novels to me. It was choppy and I was often times lost. Time moved too quickly was was only explained by many-year-long sleeps. I found this irritating and unimaginative. I also feel as if Maguire has the idea in his mind, but cannot tell it effectively.Overall, good story if you can look past the confusing word choices and broken story-telling."
3,Not Maguire's Best,"Maguire has made himself quite successful spinning off fairy tales, but this variation on Snow White seemed lacking. His take on Cinderella in ""Confessions of an Ugly Stepsister"" was steeped in history, and ""Wicked"" was immersed in the fantastical world of Oz, while ""Mirror Mirror"" couldn't decide if it wanted to be history or fantasy.""Mirror Mirror"" changes perspective often. The lustful and incestual Borgias, the innocent and fair Bianca, her father on his quest for a limb from the Tree of Knowledge, and the mystical ""dwarves"" all take turns narrating. I often found it choppy and inconsistent. While I enjoyed it, I've enjoyed Maguire's other books much more than this one."
2,Not as good as other Maguire Novels...,"I want to start out by saying that I really enjoy Gregory Maguire novels. I think that they are fantastic and very imaginative.But...I found this re-telling of Snow White to be lacking. I enjoyed the new twists that Maguire added. The Borgias were a great addition and his Snow White was very sympathetic. But the story was very short and none of the characters, except for Bianca (Snow White) and Lucrezia Borgia (Wicked Step-Mother) were fleshed out at all.The mirror itself was a problem. Very little detail was given about how it became magical. There was a little bit of an explanation, but nothing substantial. I expected more from this author.In short, I was very disappointed. It seemed like Maguire wrote an outline and someone else actually wrote the book. And not very well."
3,A Disappointment,"I adored Wicked and quickly followed with Ugly. I loved Ugly even more and couldn't wait to read Mirror. Normally, Gregory Maguire has a gift for vivid and exciting story-telling. Mirror, however, seemed like a second-rate effort on his part. It lacks in fluidity and intrigue. If you haven't read Wicked or Ugly, I highly recommend that you do. If you have already read them, you might consider skipping Mirror. Maguire can do better."
3,Maybe if you don't have anything better to do...,"It was certainly a creative book and I found it an interesting rendition of the tale of Snow White. However, it was VERY odd at times. Also, much of the book leaves the plot to the imagination, which I like, but I felt that some things could have definitely been elaborated on or expressed more clearly. I felt the author's style of writing was made to be excessively complex. Perhaps he subconciously wanted to emphasize the fact that this was a book for adults rather than children. Or maybe he just writes that way normally (I haven't read his other work). However, I think the story could have been told better in a different voice. If you like fantasy and history, you might want to grab this book if you have a long plane flight in front of you. That's why I did."
2,An act of will to finish,"I really likedWicked, my introduction to Maguire's writing. It didn't just retell the story, it turned the story on its head. It had a leading character with real personality, someone I could care about. Given that experience, I had high hopes for this one, as well.I'm wrong a lot. The only characters that actually did enough to reveal their personality, other than Lucrezia, existed for only a few pages out of the whole book. Action? Not a lot. In fact, some of the major characters, the ""dwarves"", were never explained well enough for me to understand why they even bothered.It's happened before, that I loved one of an author's books and found myself bored half into a coma by another. Maybe Maguire has written some other good stuff, in addition to Wicked. I'm not going to put a lot of effort into hunting it down.-- wiredweird"
4,The Simpson's Game,"I received this game quickly. I was happy because my kids were happy to rush upstairs to play it. I have bought used games on here before and this one I don't have to return. it is in good to better condition, very playable. I saw the kids playing it and it is a story about the army, homer's dad is in the military and so are the other simpson's. Interesting game. New this game costs about $40, so I was glad I got it used for way less. I would give it five stars but my teenage son was a little confused on one part of the game."
3,"I would recommend this product, but the sides ...","I would recommend this product, but the sides need to be gathered more and curved upwards so that leaks don't happen. This would prevent some embarrassment among users of the Poise Pads. Absorbency was great, and they were very comfortable. They looked bulky like pads, but they didn't bunch up like pads do. Also the back needs a little more adhesive to keep it in place on those days when you're moving around a lot. Overall, I like the product and would definitely use it again."
1,Don't waste your money,Any game that is so buggy that you cannot even get past the menu screen is NOT okay with me.
3,Fun if you are new to the console.,"This game would be a whole lot more fun to someone that is new to the console, but for myself having played over 150 XBOX 360 games, I have certainly played far better games. That doesn't mean there can't be some fun here, it's just not as prevelent as some of the other games I have played in my carrer as a 360 owner. I believe COD4, BFBC, Halo3, Bioshock, and Mass Effect are head and shoulders over this game.PROS: Funny and easy to play, Not overly difficult, Good story, Much better use of the side missions in this one than the first. Fun with a friend and easier with a friend. Good character designs.CONS: Okay, here we go, the game has some very poor technical issues, and the graphics are the worst I have seen in newer games. Dialouge is funny the first thousand times but begins to grate on your nerves after a while.Overall: wait for price drop!"
4,Mercenaries 2,Very pleased with the expedient timeframe in which the product was shipped. No hesitation on getting the product out in the mail. My son was very pleased with the product. The only issue we have not figured out is why the Xbox has to be off line for the game to work. That's another issue I guess.
3,Cool effects but bad controls,the game is very promising. After the first time i played it i thought wow the explosions are awesome. but i also thought the controls were a bit sluggish and would take time to get used to. more so than other games. its hard to get the aiming reticule where you want it because its sort of slow and usually goes past where you want it. overall the only thing recommending this game is the cool explosions. only buy this if you love explosions and destructible enviroments. although i dont think its a good game it was satisfying to take out the guy sniping me from the window by blowing up the entire house.
3,Random fun,"Great game if you just want to screw around for a while.The story isn't the best, but it could've been worse.Gameplay isn't the great, but then again it could be worse.If you want an engaging story-gameplay mix, this isn't it. If you want a game you can jump on, blow stuff up then get off, here ya go.Graphics are so-so and the gameplay is pretty bumpy."
4,all you have to know!,"this game is a very fun game you can do everything(fly any helicopter drive any car or tanks you find. and you can buy or hijack them.)But you cant fly any big planes or jets, and you don't have a parachute so if your enemies shoot or bomb your plane down you fall and die or you get low on health.The game is a two player game but only online.Overall its a fun game but the action like when you shoot isn't awesome like in splinter cell conviction but its still good.I would buy this game. And the fact that you can do everything is so fun. But you should buy this game if it has to be a teen game otherwise if you want another great game that you can do everything plus you have a parachute buy just cause 2 but it is a mature game!"
3,Fun but weird,This game is fun but some problems are it would not load sometimes or I would be walking and the world would look messed up and then I would fall through the world
4,Great resource and good for self study,"I bought this book because I felt that in my undergraduate Chemistry education, I didn't receive enough mathematical training. As I start graduate school, this book has been helpful in seeing the bigger picture of important mathematical concepts and tools. One can really learn a lot if you take the time to read the chapters AND do the problems. It is, in my opinion, a great resource if you need a refresher on some topic, although (as the authors note) not everything can be covered in detail.My only personal wish is that there was more visual, esp. graphical, content to accompany the concepts. As a visual learner this approach really helps me. The early chapters do well, but figures become sparse in later chapters. Other than that an excellent book."
3,Worth the 99 cents,I bought this e-book because I have admired the works of Edgar Allan Poe even though I have only read a few of his novels and poems. I took it in the order it was presented and have enjoyed it so far. I wasn't too worried about the table of contents. The price is a bargain so I have no complaints.
2,Not a very user friendly version.,"I should have read the reviews before making this purchase. It sounds like a great deal to get Poe's entire works for $.95, but I would have rather spent a little more to get better quality. The description tells you there is an interactive table of contents, which is true; however, you cannot merely ""go to"" the TOC. You must scroll through to find it. The other option is to save the location and go to it that way- still a nuisance. Also, rather than seeing a title, the stories are listed as chapters (i.e. chapter 1). This makes it impossible to know which story you are selecting. Even when you go to the story the title is the chapter number.Very disappointing! I have not read yet, so I hope the stories are intact! If you want something with better usability, then get something else."
1,how can i use this?,there is no table of contents. that would be fine if it was clearly labelled before i bought the dang thing!and a book this long? of course it should have a table of contents!!
4,Good but depressing,The first story is very depressing but it makes you think. It was a very good book over all. It's one of the few books I enjoy re-reading.
4,Well reasoned and helpful information,"Although I'm not a woman, I read this book after my wife read it. The author takes a practical view of the subject and makes it approchable. The book provides a good amount of background and answers all of the what/when/where/why questions surrounding the subject. After reading the book, I had a great understanding of the author's methodology and had no unanswered questions in my mind. The length of the book and depth of information are appropriate, and make for a quick and helpful read. This is a very helpful book because among other things, let lets the reader know that this is a common activity that she might wish to try too."
5,A Thoughtful Read...,Almost anybody who has taken even a single course in Physics at High School level would have come across Neils Bohr name in what is known as Bohr's Model of the Atom. But that model hardly gives a clue to the genius of Bohr - what seems simple and evident to us now was a great leap of human understanding. And this book helps us appreciate that.One senses an almost reverential tone in the way the book has been written. It would have taken away from the book except that the facts are lucidly and logically stated. Even the opinions voiced by many of Bohr's colleagues are put in proper context. All in all one gets the feeling of a well thought out and well-researched book.
2,Somewhat interesting but quite contrary,"""The Gravitational Force of the Sun"" has some good information and data about the Sun's gravitational force, but it seemed to me that it's main theme was ""Newton was wrong"". If you are looking for a nice book that give you lots of interesting information about the Sun, I'd recommend ""The Restless Sun"" by Donat G. Wentzel, or ""Solar Astrophysics"" (which is more technical) by Peter Foukal."
2,Pricey and not great quality,I purchased this for my son along with the keyboard and mouse. I was please with the mouse and keyboard but the mousepad lasted 3-4 days before one of the edges became unglued. It does look grade (only reason I gave it two stars).For the price you are paying you should get a little higher quality.
1,Whatever,"Some people won't ""get"" the satisfacton out of this album as they would get out of other JB albums. But the fact remains that at the time this was head and shoulders above anything else out there at the time. He was starting to enter his real electric and socially concious period here. Lighten up, enjoy, and move forward."
4,Battery charger + camera case,"Ordering was simple, delivery quick.The Opteka battery charger appears pretty good. It was hard to get a good connection with all the batteries in the charger.The case was a nice bonus."
2,"well made, but for what purpose?","This kitchen implement seems very well made, but it doesn't do what I expected it to do. It hacks off thick slices of cheese instead of the thin wafers that my old cheese slicer did. Luckily I found my old cheese slicer that was lost. It seems to me you can do just as good a job or better with a knife as you can with the cheese slicer sold here. I think the design flaw is that the blade is angled out too far for cutting a thin slice. As shown in the picture the blade is cut away at the sides, whereas my old one isn't and the angle is sharper in the one here. So, if you are looking for one that will slice more finely, one with a shallower angle might be the thing to look for."
3,Disappointing,I found this CD rather disappointing.I personally prefer the quena flutes to the more common Andean panflutes or sikus but alas there were too few track featuring those marvellous quenas.So for anyone interested in the Andean Musical instrumentsI would not recomend this CD
2,Overrated,"This album fails miserably in comparison to Jay-z's debut Reasonable Doubt. It's ""MTV"" friendly sound boosted its appeal, but left little to the true ""hip-hoppers"" expectations of a solid album. This marked the bigging of Jigga's lyrical fall."
3,Shipping,"The CD my son wanted was great he loved it. The only problem we had is it took so long to get here we are talking several weeks and for a child it may have been a year, (it seemed that long to him) he would ask everyday is it here yet. (I for one almost went to walmart and got it there) It was a long time in receiveing it."
3,Nigga What? Nigga Who?,"If you don't know you better ask somebody! Every song on the first disk is tight! ""Money, Cash, Hoes,"" blazin'!! Not to mention ""Resevoir Dogs, and Paper Chase"" The only thing that did not bang was that useless second c.d. It was pure dookey!!"
1,8 figga piece of garbage,This CD is weak the only good songs were money aint a thing and jigga what jigga who. and the only reason money aint a thing is good is because J.D. features in it. I would not recomend that anybody should buy this. It was a waste of my money i know that.
5,This CD just plain rocks,"I like this CD because it's not hankypanky playa rap that has been running rampant of late, but its also not the ultra-depressing kind of rap that makes you want to blow away your CD player. I just love it."
2,It's an OK CD,this isn't the best CD... not even that tight. but you might want to listen to some of the songs sometimes... Let me repeat: it's nothing special.
3,A Real Dissapointment,"Jay-Z's third album was a dissapointment. After two great albums he fell off for two albums then came back with ""The Dynasty"".""Hard Knock Life"" is a pretty tight track but gets boring if you listen too much. ""If I Should Die"" is a great song though and so is ""Ride Or Die"". ""Nigga What Nigga Who"" is a pretty good track. ""Money Cash Hoes"" is a dissapointment from Jigga and DMX. ""A Week Ago"" really grows on you and Too Short really shines. ""Coming Of Age"" isn't that great. ""Can I Get A"" is a great track that showcases Ja Rule, Amil, and Jigga. ""Paper Chase"" is yet another dissapointing track with Foxy Brown. ""Reservoir Dogs"" and ""It's Like That"" are also dissapointing and so is ""It's Alright"" but ""Money Ain't A Thang"" is a great song with JD rhymin and producin.I wouldn't suggest getting this before any of Jigga's other albums but it's worth a shot."
4,ONE OF THE 10 BEST EVER,JIGGA IS ONE THE TOP 5 RAPPER EVER. IT IS A SHAME IT TOOK BIGGGIE DEATH FOR HIM TO CLAIM KING OF NY. BROOKLAWN IN THE HOUSE FLATBUSH
1,JAY Z,"I just like only the title ""It's a hard knock life"" and I find that JAY Z is very horrible with his big nose and his big eyes. Bye Bye Miss A.T."
2,"No disrespect to Jay-Z, but...","Jay-Z has some nice beats, but... He really sounds bored and asleep on the record. There are some nice songs, but most of them have been milked by MTV and BET so much that they make me sick. The only one I really like that wasn't played out was ""Paper Chase"", featuring Foxy Brown(a great female rapper). The rest is just commercial stuff. I really don't think Jay-Z is really a very good lyricist even though everyone says he is. Q-Tip, Nas and Kurupt are much better lyricists. Jay-Z probably won't make any more albums, but his first two were tight, this one isn't very good."
5,Absuloutly fantastic!,"I thought this CD was one of the best I ever heard. Although it is not sutible for all ages, everyone should here it."
4,Pretty good,"The beats are great on this CD, but the lyrics need some work. Jigga's flow and delivery are as good as they ever was, but he has resorted to pure gangsta rap lyrics, and thats not a good thing. Buy this album though, its the perfect party CD."
5,Calssic Rock Influence with a County Personality,"Norm Allen's newest CD is great! A little country, a little cajon, a little island--completely a unique style. Completely original. With a baritone-tenor voice, Norm Allen writes and sings of life's experiences that we have all lived--or have wanted to live.Norm's music and style makes you come alive!"
1,Benji 4 movie set,"I ordered this set to show to my grandkids when they came to visit. Unfortunately, by the time I was able to have them here it was too late to return the movies! My box came with 2 CDs, but they were both the same, so instead of getting four movies, I got 2 of the same 2 movies! Im still missing 2 of the movies. From now on I will check out my purchases as soon as they come whether I need them then or not!! Im very disappointed that I cant return the duplicates and get the two missing movies!!"
2,"Bottomfeeders, etc","This collection doesn't particularly slice the melon for me. Some decent recollections, a few self-important remembrances, a blast of bad tribute poetry here and there. Go read Factotum, instead"
1,Terrible!!,"This is the worst book on Stanford that I have ever seen. The pictures are small and faded . . . I have photos taken in 1975 with a cheap camera that look better than what you'll find here. (Ah, but the cover pic looks awfully nice, you might think. Yes, it does. Fine bit of hucksterism from Princeton Architectural Press.)"
4,Excellent,You need to spend some time going back and forth between your computer and this study book but it explains pretty much all the nuts and the bolts of this program.
4,Great!,"This features the Highlights of Handel's Messiah by the London Symphony. This DVD does not show the actual performance (orchestra, choir, soloists,etc.) of the Messiah like I was expecting. While listening to the Messiah you choose a visual theme of either progam notes, history, European paintings, or mountains. The mountain scenes are beautiful and are my favorite. Although there isn't a caption option, the sound is clear and there is the option of either DTS stereo or 5.1 Dolby. I enjoy Handel's Messiah more now that I have this DVD. For it's intended use, the DVD deserves 5 stars but since it lacks the actual performance video, I'll withold my star rating to 4."
2,Not much to say...,"Here we have a long winded and very tedious story of a young man who enjoys walking around all day and night. We also are privy to his eating and sleeping and masterbating. Sometimes he follows people around and pretends to hurt them and sometimes he just masterbates some more. Kinda describes the daily activities of alot of people I know. But thankfully, they don't feel the need to write 600 pages about their wandering around and masterbating."
1,They don't stack well. Kind of defeats the purpose.,"The bins arrived slightly out of square, and were too rigid to be fixed. They wouldn't stack. Therefore, I can't recommend them."
3,For Experts,"The first section for joints was great. Abut half the stretches were on a level for Olympic Gymnasts though. The cover on the dvd says it's even for folks who have been totally inactive. No way. She looked like a pretzel at times. It's a great dvd for dancers, gymnasts, etc., but if you're older and wanting a stretch routine to get better mobility, this is probably not the one for you to start with."
4,Watching the Maiden critics closely,"The September 24, 2006 review by D.Andrade calls this record a ""weak album"" but his review is inconsistent.About guitarist Janick Gers, he states that ""its time for Janick to step aside"" and ""his sloppy playing is just not cutting it"" and he believes Janick is dragging the band down.Just two paragraphs later, he writes that ""there are a few good hooks in some of the songs, and The Legacy is a truly great Maiden song."" The Legacy however is a song written by and prominantly features on guitar, none other than Janick Gers. So what the hell is D.Andrade talking about?I happen to depend on many reviews on Amazon when deciding whether or not to purchase a cd and think many of them are helpful whether written postively or negatively. I at least expect that the reviewer is honestly writing from an informed perspective."
5,Iron Maiden is out to get you!!,"I think I blame superficial guys who gave this a bad review, because they didnt even give it a fair listen and didnt even spent any time on listening to it over and over.This album Rocks and the music and the lyrics combine to give an idea and an Iron Maiden style together..UP THE IRONS!!"
3,How many times do I have to listen to this album to like it???,"Ok, so I am a Maiden fan... but I still don't like this album, even after listening to it for about 15 times now. Maybe I've been listening to too much power metal to enjoy Maiden anymore, but I love Bruce Dickinson's solo career... Why can't Maiden sound like Bruce's music?Many of the songs are very slow and drag on for too long. Due to this reason, this album can easily be classified as Prog Rock rather than Metal.In my opinion it is unfair that some reviewers are comparing this album to the albums Maiden released in the 80's era, this is misleading to many classic Maiden fans."
5,never a big fan,"i was never a huge fan untill this cd. although i have every cd they have made,i like piece of mind cd but this just blows that away. this is a very tight cd every song is great and i like the second half of this cd the best."
2,"Better than DOD, but...","Really not even close to all the hype, with the average review saying that it's ""the closest thing to Seventh Son..."" After hearing the new album a couple times through, that statement is truly laughable.Granted, it is a huge step up in quality from Dance Of Death, Maiden's worse release ever, even more horrible than the universally panned Virtual 11. At least that one had better than average tracks like ""Futureal"" and ""The Clansman"". DOD has NOTHING redeemable involved in it's content whatsoever.But AMOLAD is an improvement in songwriting, guitar soloing and tradition Metal guitar riffing (at times.) It shows a slight improvement in life in the band which was definitely lacking as of late. I am glad that they have slightly recovered, but that doesn't mean that they have recovered their past glories. To truly visit those times, all you need to do is go listen to any of their benchmark first seven albums."
2,average cd,"Is it extremely necessary to put 7-8 minutes songs??It's kind of boring sometimes, is like another reviewer said here, a single song just with blanks within. This album could be called easily Dance of death II, why once again the word death on the album title, epic songs are good, but 1 or 2, not 10, bad bad bad, I'd rather listen to the old Maiden (killers, number of the beast, etc.)"
4,Excellent!,"Iron Maiden deliver their best album since ""Seventh Son!"" While they still need to fire Janick Gers, they still sounds amazing. Strongly recommended!"
2,Not really anything new here,"First song ""Different World"" is fantastic. From there it just goes downhill. Songs are mostly slow and plodding, production is stripped down to the point it loses all the energy the band once had. The cover artwork is perhaps the least imaginative ever from Maiden. Looks like an old Stormtroopers of Death cover.Technically, of course all the playing is spot on, as it should be considering how long all these guys have been doing this. However, when you add it all up into a song, the sum is not really greater than the parts.Buy ""Piece of Mind"" and forget about this one."
5,Iron Maiden : A Matter of Life and Death,"This album is incredible. Don't listen to the people who whine about how it's not like their 80's material. ""These Colours Don't Run"", ""Brighter Than a Thousand Suns"" and ""Lord of Light"" are powerful tracks that only a band like Maiden could pull off. I rank this album in the top 5 Maiden albums. Get it!"
3,Sadistic Aliens Spoil Otherwise Good Plot,"Graf's writing strengths are quite evident in ""Time's Enemy"", but this reviewer is one of those unfortunate who can't stand to watch pain, torture or prolonged death in any form. The time-travel stuff is great, the doubled characters are great, the personality interactions are well done. But the aliens...They're a little TOO scary. Even Borg practices don't seem so bad compared to these omnivorous, unthinkingly(??) cruel baddies. They give a slightly Michael Crichton-ish feel to what should be an enjoyable story, as one group of sentients after another is wiped out and then condemned to a sort of living, walking death.If you like Stephen King you may enjoy this story. If you read Michael Crichton you won't even blink. But if your standard fare is more like Anne of Green Gables and the Chronicles of Narnia, the suffering the aliens cause (both described and implied) will spoil the rest of the story for you."
4,Wonderfully written book about an experience of Nazi Germany,"Berlin Wild is a wonderfully written book about a half Jewish, half German man who was put to work in a mysterious scientific institute at the age of sixteen. It has the perfect amount of tragedy, drama, sensuality, and comedy to express the experiences of the character Josef Bernhardt throughout his stunning life. Each character is a world within him/herself."
2,Water Everywhere!,"So, last night I picked up this humidifier for my bedroom. I followed the directions and put it on a table that could get wet, 6 inches away from anything else, and even put a plastic placemat underneath for good measure. It ran all night on medium and had plenty of water in the reserve when I woke up. However, it did not create a ""visible"" mist, instead it sprayed water everywhere. I woke up to a soaked carpet and a thoroughly wet table. This is being returned today."
1,Don't buy it!,"My $50 mistake. I bought this on Consumer Reports' recommendation alone and didn't also read reviews as I usually do. The mineral deposits that this and apparently all mist-type humidifiers leave on your furniture are totally unacceptable. A horrible, filthy mess and we only used it at night on the low fan setting! Even if you can afford to constantly buy distilled water for the thing you're not completely safe. ANY mineral content in the water is going to get precipitated out and collect on every flat surface in the room.I'm trying a Lasko evaporator humidifier next. I have had evaporators before and know their problems, but at least they don't crud up your furniture."
1,Junk.,"Worked okay the first few days. However, this unit is a pain to keep clean, and if you slack off even a little, it creates a nasty smell and visible mold on the unit itself. We used it for two months before giving up. It got to the point where it would just create a big wet spot around the unit itself without actually increasing the humidity of the room noticeably (we have a hydrometer). Don't waste your money on this piece of junk!"
2,Impossible to clean well,"It does a satisfactory job of adding humidity to the air, but I've just disassembled it as far as I can, and there are still places I can't reach to clean (I also cut my hand on a sharp edge).I hate the thought that I'm breathing that pink stuff."
1,Works but is sooooo NOISEY!!!,"The unit is effective in putting moisture into the air but is the noisiest humidifier that I have ever owned. I would not reccomend this to anyone and would take the unit back to the store from which I purchased it but i waited too long. And, people should realize just because it is a filter free unit DOES NOT mean that you never have to clean it. You have to clean it regularly. In fact the instructions suggest you clean it DAILY. If you clean it at least weekly with a weak solution of bleach it seems to retard any yucky growth."
1,DO NOT BUY!,"We unfortunately bought this for our newborn and it is a disaster! He loves white noise, but this unit is making a lot more than white noise (as described over and over in other reviews here). It also is impossible to clean. Literally, the mold gets in places that I can't clean with a Q-tip. My baby's room now smells like mildew - a very strong smell. I'm very upset that this humidifier is a hazard to his health and wish I would've kept the box. PLEASE don't buy this. You will regret it! :("
1,AVOID AT ALL COSTS,this may be the worst humidifier ever made. If it is possible to hate a hunk of poorly designed badly constructed plastic - you will hate this humidifier.only purchase this product if:1) If you don't really like to sleep while your humidifier is on - or need annoying background noise to sleep.2) you have way to much money and you want to just throw a bunch of it in the garbage BEFORE you buy a GOOD humidifier.3) if you are self abusive - and have deep emotional problems that lead to to make poor choices that hurt you.AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!!!
1,"Awful to clean, grows mold.","It's impossible to clean. I replaced the protec beads often and used vinegar regularly but still got buildup, mold and grime. You can't get the interior cavity clean at all. I'm throwing it away."
2,Disappointed,"This was hard to keep clean, developed mildew quiclkly which was a nightmare to get rid of. Only used a couple months and discarded."
1,Crazy Loud,Cant believe they can sell something capable of making this much noise. I am not whining about a little white noise (I prefer SOME noise when I sleep) but this is obnoxiously loud!
3,very loud,"I liked the idea of no filter.. so I got this for $50 at my local walgreens. It is very loud, even on the lowest setting. The highest setting is super loud.. I wouldnt suggest buying this if you are going to use it at night, unless you like white noise in the background."
4,Really puts out the humidity!,"I'm unsure why this filter has such negative reviews. I read that some people are upset that it shuts off. If you read about the product, it automatically detects the humidity in the room and will shut off when it reaches that level that you set it for. Also, it really puts out some good moisture. It doesn't leak but you don't want to run it for hours without realizing it will get things moist around it but that's why they say to set it 5 inches from things. It's loud but I find the sound soothing. Especially when I run it all night as it drowns out any other noise in the house and I fall asleep like a baby. I haven't experienced any mold issues. I understand that I it is best to let it run even after it runs out of water as the fan will dry out the unit and it's ok for the fan to run without water. In fact they recommend you let it run and dry it out and it won't burn out anything."
2,Do not waste your time!,"We really tried to give this machine a try. We purchased it a little over a month ago. Worked great at first, after about 3 weeks the thing just died and would not turn on. The manual said the overheat switch must have came on and to call customer service for help. I called for nothing, I got the impression you would be able to reset the switch and the machine would resume working. Not!! The agent said the machine did indeed die and we should return it to the store or they could send us another one.Well, we took it back to the store and got the same model hoping the one we had was a dud. After just 8 days the new one just stopped working last night. But this one starting making a funny smell the last two days before it gave out. I called the customer service again to complain and they said they would replace the machine with any other product they carried (not necessarily vicks).Do not waste your time on this piece of junk!"
5,A must to have,It is definetly one of the best albums I ever herd. Not that this comes with a suprice. She definetly deserves her title. Even if you are not a salsa fan it is that kind of music everybody can enjoy. I recently seen her and Jose Alberto in a concert and hearing La vida es un carneval live was something I will never forget. ASUCAR....
5,Think this book isn't for you? You're wrong.,"Bill White provides timeless advice for anyone looking to succeed in the world. His words of wisdom apply not only for business managers, but for anyone wanting to get ahead in the world. Regardless of your job, regardless of your lifestyle, Bill breaks down some universal truths and helps you apply them to your life. You may have heard some of the advice before, but it will never mean as much, will never be as applicable to your life, as when you read it in Bill's words."
5,Artist kit - excellent,"My 11 year old granddaughter was thrilled with this artist kit. It has everything needed to get a serious start on art for a beginner. Beautifully presented in sturdy, professional looking display kit. I would recommend it highly. You can tell it is made in USA and not that 'other' country. Only top quality materials."
4,"Some Bland Moments, but mostly Excellent","This is the soundtrack to a short video: imagine Koyaanisqatsi with TD instead of Philip Glass, and the Grand Canyon, instead of the panoply of life in the USA: and less deep-meaning, more pure aesthetics. The music and pictures are just superb together, but the music does stand alone pretty well. If ""Sudden Revelation"" doesn't hit your ""Ooh-Yeah!"" button, then get somebody to bury you before the neighbours start complaining about the smell."
4,The expected brilliance,"More quiet, literate, sad, beautiful pop, somewhat reminiscent of the Smiths or John Cale-style Velvet Underground. The only disappointing track here is the spoken ""Space Boy Dream"" which, since it is neither witty nor even interesting, gets boring after the first listen. The rest of the album, however, is more than worth the price of the CD."
4,"Blithe, baby, blithe","Aaah, happiness at last. This is not an album of hippie-chic, it is a genuine attempt to bring the beauty of intricate simplicity into rock music. Belle and Sebastian beleive that it is OK to gently lay ideas on the table instead of throwing them through your mind by use of loud and obnoxious guitar solos. The vocals are soothing but provovative. Lyrics are almost trancendentalist poetry. At last, music with a message that doesn't slam it in your face. You go, B&S."
4,i wonder which in mind they/he refer to most . . .,"this one's more gloriously sunny - in the sense that your life has been a headache for a while - like a strange, bloodied mess, and you let go of it all, run outside in your t-shirt and flop around on the grass and lay face up towards the sky.this of thoughts like a summer wasting, ease your feet in the sea, and dirty dream number 2.but, seymour stein and chickfactor and even roller coaster ride get kinda boring and weighed down."
4,uniform belt,This belt works good with my daughter's Rawlings pants. Only problem she has with the belt is the adjustable size loop is hard to move and gets caught in the belt loops when she puts it on and takes it off.
4,Did the job! Too big for T-ball but it was fine!,I needed a blue belt for my son's Yankees unifrom. This was the right color and looked nice but it was too big for my son (who wears size 6 in boys). It was fine since his pants fit but it would have been nice to know what size this was before so hopefully this review will help someone else! It would be fine for someone in boys size 10 or higher I think! :) And it does stretch of course!
4,"Great price, decent value","Got these to match a uniform the coach for some reason didn't want to have black belts with. They're thin, but reasonably sturdy."
5,Really great,"In no time at all, I was able to read and write some simple Latin sentences.Works great with Henle Latin Grammar book, which I also highly recomend."
3,"Soul Asylum, just toned down a little","This is probably Soul Asylum's most mellow album. It lacks the intensity of some of their earlier work but it is still tuneful in most places. It has some pretty good songs most notably I will still be laughing and New York Blackout. I only had Grave Dancers Union and Let Your Dim Light Shine when I bought this one and upon first few listens I kept thinking ""Man, come on wheres the get up and go?"" I appreciate it for what it is, a decent, mellow Soul Asylum record which is better than most music out there. Its not their best album but it isnt bad either."
1,This book is terrible,"I've never read such a horrible novel in my life. Not only is it published by 1st Books, a vanity publisher, but it's chock full of grammatical errors. Obviously, this book wasn't cleaned by a copy editor (or any editor for that matter). The plot is nonsensical, cliché and just plain eye rolling. What's the crappiest science fiction plot you could envision? That's right, alien abduction! And guess what the big climax is...(...)"
1,All supposition,"This documentary is all supposition with any documentation either ""Lost"" or ""Locked Up"".Personally I feel Jesus never would have needed to leave Galilee to learn teachings of compassion and caring about one another. The other Isrealite/Jewish teachers of the same period taught basically the same thing as Jesus. There is no need to go on a quest lasting many years to Kashmir, India, or Tibet."
4,Really?,Suspend disbelief and just enjoy the ride. Fun little film full of supposition. Watch the bonus material too. It's ripe with interesting stuff.
5,Get in the water!,"Simple, easy and fun to learn. Clear and concise drawings and pictures (black and white mind you, but very clear). Easy to understand and a quick way to bust out with the sailors lingo."
4,Great X-Men story,"The X-Men fight to protect humans from mutants who believe they can enslave humanity. But in Genosha, humans dominate mutants, treating them like genetic property. They do this by wiping their minds clean and harvesting them as ""mutates"". Great story, but the art in a few issues needs work."
3,corner desk,"This product is a good size for an apartment (dimensions were not identified in product description) and is fairly easy to assemble. The workspace is adequate. With the PCU shelf attached (which is wider than the desk's flat surfaces) the desk is unbalanced, won't sit flush with the wall, and tilts unexpectedly."
2,Lumbar support not good,"Watch the lumbar bulge on the bench. Marcy calls it ""lumbar support"", but as a long time lifter, I found it very annoying. There is a good chance it will bug you. Try before you buy."
3,Love the scripts but not the music,"I really like all her beautiful written subliminal scripts but I don't like the music especially the second track. The noise really bothers my ears with the headphone. I would like to take good care of my hearing, to be able to appreciate beautiful music. I would prefer the natural ocean waves. Ms. Howell, please produce one with Ocean Wave like [...]"
4,The John Wooden Pyramid of Success,"Basketball fan or not, this is a good read. Even better if you are. John Wooden's Pyramid is a pattern for successful living with tools that provide the means & inspiration to guide you to a more worthwhile and fulfilling life. Teamwork is the foundation for success in any team effort, on or off the court. This would be a great gift for teenagers invloved in sports. Coach Wooden's teams proved you don't have to be a ""glory hound"" to gain recognition."
2,Not for children's shoes.,"I purchased these laces for my 7 y.o. son who always has to keep tying his shoes over and over.These laces came on a pair of NB running shoes I purchased last year, and I thought they were great. They ""made sense"".Well, my son tore through these within a week.I wouldn't buy them for children. Maybe they're just not tough enough."
3,Good but has a defect,This cd was bought at new quality and appears that way except that the 7th track has a dent that causes it to not play on any device except my 2012 car CD player
4,The Archetype of British Reggae,"Quite simply a milestone in reggae music, this album established British reggae's tempo, tone, originality and authenticity. Marvelously rich, textured and emotional, the album and the band ironically found a place in the hearts and record collections of many young British punk rockers drawn to Steel Pulse' upstart nature. Worth buying if only for the beautiful musical mosaic of 'Prediction' with its haunting flamenco guitar. The track 'Ku Klux Klan' is in my opinion better rendered in the live version found on the comiplation ""Live At the Electric Circus."""
5,Recommended for for young readers ages 4 to 8,"When Mrs. Picket says, ""I have an idea"", you never know what's coming next! She made the cows raincoats with her new sewing machine and now they won't come into the barn to be milked. The chickens are too busy promenading around the barnyard in their new bonnets and sunglasses to lay eggs. And how is a rooster supposed to wake up early when he's so cozy in his new flannel pajamas and cap! These and other dilemmas Mrs. Picket creates for Farmer Picket when she begins creating animal fashions will leave children laughing out loud! Tom Dunsmuir wrote ""You Can't Milk A Dancing Cow"" for young readers ages 4 to 8. Enhanced with Brian Jones' energetic and memorable illustrations, this original and highly recommended picturebook story will be read over and over again by generations of new and appreciative young readers."
2,Not Even Her Beautiful Prose Could Save This Tedious Bore,"Having read about twenty of Tanith Lee's novel, I have to say that this is definitely the worst. The idea of a Romeo & Juliet story played differently in a parallel universe is charming, but probably only merits a short-story or novella length work. 400 pages of tiresome infighting between the houses of swaggering Italian stallions causes the eyelids to droop. The characters of substance are peripheral, and we're expected to care about the traumas that befall the vain & vacuous. Not even her lovely prose, extensive colorful vocabulary, and the occasional interesting passages can save this novel from being an utter bore."
4,Very nice...,"I personally love ""The Power of Good-Bye"", and while ""Mer Girl"" is not quite as good, the single is more than worthy of its purchase price...Madonna sings in beautiful form with this single..."
5,"5 stars for ""Barbie Girl"" and ""Lollypop (Candyman)""","I love Aqua! In this CD my favorite are ""Barbie Girl"" and ""Lollypop (Candyman)""! I love these songs! Way to go Aqua!"
3,it's okay,"good fun...not too bad...nice, funny, inspiring, easy to listen to, good for unwinding, that's about it, that's it. yes...fun fun fun..."
2,Danish teen disco-pop,"Admitted: this catches the ear. And Lene Nystrm has a verycute and sexy voice. This is pure industry - music designed to beshort-lived but to earn zillions during this short time. And it certainly did. It will never be engraved into the history books of muzik, though. A true buy-and-throw-away CD. Keep it for a month, play it till your blue in the head. No refund, no recycling."
4,It was cool.,"It has good songs on it but some of them are dumb. I like Barbie World but I don't like Happy Boys and Girls. So, it's 6 of 1. If I'm at a party and they want me to play that song, I'll play it but it's not my favorite."
3,Check out their 2nd album instead,"Okay, we all know the hit song ""Barbie Girl."" It's a cute dance song (I have grown tired of it though) and the only other song on this album that I like is the pretty ballad ""Be A Man."" Check out ""Cartoon Heroes"", just about every song on their sophmore release is pure gold!"
4,"Music that will make you puke, and have a good time doing it","Aquarium, a nice sliver pancake, is oldschool disco with a near lethal injection of techno. The first time I listened to this funny looking frisbee, I thought it was yicky techno-bop, not even worth bothering to file it into the collection. I was embarrassed at the prospect of confessing that I paid money for this foil&plastic sam'mich, BUT I kept listening to it. I thought it was awful, but I couldn't stop listening. I couldn't abstain from playing it ad nauseum. Listening to aqua is like having a knack for narcotics. With just shy of half a million plays logged on my disc shaped music cartridge, I'm proud to say that AQUA is a good band.I don't call this ""fresh"", mind you, nor is this ""tight"" or ""phat"". I rather to call it good.In short,A painful infectious disease;My favorite disease."
4,AQUA,AQUA HAS FROM THERE RECORD COMPANY GOT TOP PRIORITY NEXT YEAR WHEN THEY REALEASE THERE 2ND ALBUM.THAT MEANS ALL THE RECORD DEPARTMENTS AROUND THE WORLD SHOULD BE READY FOR A BIG CAMPAGNE ON TELEVISION AND SO
1,AQUA Cassette,"AQUA Cassette played great. Cover was a bit worn, but you don't listen to the cover. Reduce/Reuse/Recycle! Old technology is still usable. Thanks."
5,Excellent CD,"This is exactly what I was looking for. It sounds a lot like the band 2-unlimited. Very much ""happy music"" - cheery and upbeat. Well worth the money. Many of the lyrics are humorous, as you can hear from ""Barbie Girl"". I'm still smiling! =)"
1,"Been there, Done that","Average read until the last third. The monster is a cliche, but that's not all. The storytelling is stilted and the characters relatively shallow. What really bothered me, though, was the ending. The description of the monster was unnecessarily and crudely pornographic. I mean, to the point of nausea. This description wasn't necessary to enhance the mood or setting either. Nothing really added up in the end, and the demise of the monster was laughable. I bought this after reading the other reviews, which were mostly favorable. I regret it."
3,"Critical mistakes, bad for reference","Although this book is mostly ok, there are two main problems: 1) it makes mistakes critical to the understanding of the material, 2) it is terrible for reference. An example of a critical mistake is when he writes ""sall"" (shift arithmetic left) in example code, and then refers to it as ""call"" (call a function) in the following text. I found around 5 such errors in the first read...some errors were so bad that they did not make _any_ sense.Secondly, the tables of instructions are scattered and incomplete. Some instructions are only mentioned in the paragraph text and often have incomplete listings of modifiers and which data they operate on. It is also impossible to find _anything_ in the index. Most of the instructions are completely missing from the index and so are other important things like assembler directives.My projection: you will read this one time (or maybe twice) and then get a better reference book to sit on your shelf."
3,Thought it should be better..,"Well, i was really excited to see this when it came out on DVD and it is beautiful to watch as others mention but the storytelling was flat and unsuspenseful. It could have been much, much better but i felt that it was unravelling more like an Agatha Christie novel than a more visceral, Modern re-telling of the Legend of Sleepy Hollow."
4,"Tim Burton fans, rejoice","There's nothing in this movie to make you lose sleep, or drop your jaw in awe. But if you are a Tim Burton fan or even a fan of old horror films you must see this. The photography and sets are just perfect for this story, and the acting is top notch as well. Just an overall entertaining ""popcorn"" movie with with high production values. Johnny Depp continues to be one of the most underrated actors around. He has more range and ""faces"" than 80% of Hollywood."
2,TIM BURTON FANTASY,"Except for the images of a young, industrial New York City, ""Sleepy Hollow"" is rather lifeless. I too have a passion for ""Scooby-Doo Where Are You?"", but I deal with it."
4,"Great dark horror, Headless Horseman is a great charecter","This movie is too gritty and very violent, based in those middle ages where the Headless Horseman strikes terror into a small town, the tale is realistic and this movie will give you the chills, Jonny Deep and Christina Ricci are both great in this convincing horror. But be warned that this movie should not be watched by viewers under 18, it's just too damn violent. 8.5/10."
5,Sleepy Hollow is wide awake on Blu-ray,The incredible production values and performances really shine on this Blue-ray edition of Tim Burton's Sleepy Hollow. Tim Burton's rendition on the classic tale is a creepy fall take shrouded in mystery in tune with Halloween. You will not go wrong in buying this edition as it is worthy of many repeated viewings.
1,UGH! Washington Irving must be turning in his grave....,"How sad it is to see what hollywood does to American Folk Lore! The headless horseman didn't have a sword, he didn't have a vendetta and Ichabod sure wasn't a big time NYC lawyer. So sad to see a great American Classic butchered --even sadder more people will now think this is the real story."
4,A Tim Burton Masterpiece of Horror,"From the legendary tale of the headless horseman by Washington Irving & the vision of filmmaker Tim Burton is ""Sleepy Hollow"" starring Johnny Depp as investigator Ichabod Crane who determined to discover the murderous headless horseman and uncover the edvidence behind this terror. It's terrifying dark fairy tale, a american horror classic, one of Tim Burton's best, a thrilling, extrodonary movie. Watch ""Sleepy Hollow"" this Halloween."
4,"An elegant, mildly chilling movie","""Sleepy Hollow"" is a mildly chilling, elegant movie. Visually lavish, it's costumes and sweeping cinematography will exhilarate. While all the guts and gore seems a tad forced at times (we just have to see the decapitated bodies, don't we?), it just adds to all the fun. Christina Ricci's character, though, is overly subdued; we get the nagging feeling that she should be in this scene or that scene, because she would add so much to its atmosphere. Well, overall, it's been a while since an elegant, mildly scary movie came out, so please-- watch this movie. It's not top-notch cinema, but it is a great film, and the leading actors do a great job."
4,Johnny Depp is magical,"Sleepy Hollow is a pretty cool movie. Tim Burton created a spooky and dreary little world and picked Johnny Depp to play lead. You really can't go wrong. The Headless Horseman myth has always fascinated me so I was delighted to watch Burton's take on the legend. Its great because this movie has just the right amount of elements. Its mysterious, its spooky and thilling, its subtle and romantic too and its even a comedy. Of course, this isn't to be taken seriously, and its really not a scary film whatsoever, but it is a fun film. I thoroughly enjoyed watching it. Its a really good 'popcorn flick'."
4,Visually appealing but let down somewhere in the line,Well first of all the art direction of this film is marvellous.there's not a single ray of sunlight in the movie ..every scene has a dark & cloudy look which just adds to the excitement .and a good story on which this film has been based upon .the only flaw seems to be the ending which has been rushed into its conclusion . the secret is revealed in a matter of fact way .and the reason for the witchcraft seems cliched .maybe some kind of a flashback scene would have helped .but overall a fine movie with good performances by johnny depp & the boy .
2,Headless Horsemen,"The story for ""Sleepy Hollow"" is said by many to be a classic tale of witchcraft and the supernatural. But, I wholeheartedly disagree. There isn't anything to it after you get past guys on horses without heads terrorizing everything. The movie has sooooo much head chopping that you couldn't see anything more disgusting no matter how hard you looked."
1,Awful,"I like Tim Burton's movies. So, when I heard he was making a movie called ""Sleepy Hollow,"" I was very excited since my favorite story of all time is ""The Legend Of Sleepy Hollow."" However, when I saw the movie, I was disgusted with what Mr. Burton did. He took characters from my favorite story...a classic of American literature...and put them in a glorified slasher movie. It had nothing to do with Washington Irving's famous story! If Tim Burton wanted to make a horror film, why couldn't he come up with something original like he has in his other films? Better yet, he could've made a faithful adaptation of the original story!What upsets me the most is that some people, after seeing this film, will then expect to find a ""horror"" story if they read the original story, only to be ""disappointed"" to find that its actually just a good natured, old-fashioned ghost story. Believe me, reading ""The Legend Of Sleepy Hollow"" by Washington Irving is a much better experience than sitting through this film!"
3,Attractive but boring,"I had high hopes... I love Tim Burton's work, but THIS one- despite the visual beauty, impressive special effects, and a campy Depp performance, fell by the wayside. I think it was the plot- too far fetched, too off the wall. I didn't buy it because of that."
5,Beautiful and creepy,"I recently saw this on DVD and it was a great movie. It was beautifully shot and acted. The scenes were Ichabod dreams about his childhood are beautiful....to us Americans who grew up with this story well, we love the movie. The soundtrack is great also, trust me I have it!"
5,Do NOT miss this one!,"This film is an American horror classic, just like Washington Irving's story. I can't think of anyone better than Tim Burton to do it; and can't think of anyone better than Ray Park to be the stuntman in the costume. In the director's commentary Burton says, ""when your character doesn't have a head, you don't have a lot to go on except your ability with swords and axes."" That's very true. This movie would be excellent for a Halloween party!"
3,Better than I thought it would be...,"Not a bad effort! That's how I qualify this release of Sleepy Hollow. I must admit that while I'm not much of a Depp fan, his portrayal was amusing in the movie. Crane was as fearful as he was brave and the combination made this flick worth watching. My rating would actually be 3.5 stars but I don't think it'll make my DVD home library though. Though not a MUST SEE, it DOES qualify as strong rental material!"
3,Just... OK!,"I like this movie very much, I am a Tim Burton fan for years, that's the main reason why I bought it; but I must say that i was not impressed with this Blu-Ray vertion I got to say not the best DVD transfer out there these days.Still I enjoy the movie very much!"
4,great cinemotography!,"this movie could have been expanded apon a great deal more to make it better, but seeing as how i am parcial to tim burton the movie was fantastic. i would have liked to have seen some more scenes with cristopher walken, but beggers can't be choosey."
3,Good but over-rated,"I liked the movie. The acting was good and all. However, being the story of the headless horseman I believe they could have done it a little better. Good movie for free, just regret spending money on it."
5,hooray for burton/depp movies!!!,"i don't know what that other guy is talking about. This movie is great. if you like tim burton/johnny depp movies like edward scissorhands or beetlejuice then give it a try, i think you'll enjoy. This movie has the same type of visuals & musical score. plus there are quite a few other great actors, christopher walkin being one of them."
3,Excessive heads popping off,"This movie really wasn't that scary. If anything, the music being played and the sound effects made you jump. I thought it was more funny and cheesy than anything else. Seemed like someone was losing their head every few minutes, and the way it was done was kind of lame. This movie is a rental, not a buy."
5,Track listing correction,"I am correcting your song listing.Track 1.Confirm reservation2. Front Door3.Permanent Lover4. Hush Darling5. My only lover6.If I don't have you7. Poor Millionaire8. The fugitive9. Once Ago10. Oh What a Feeling- bonus tracks11. Wailing rudie- """"""""12. Top Ten- """""""""
4,A moving experience that has stayed with me for 25 years.,"Like Trout Fishing in America, but sweeter and more poingant. I've been looking for this book since 1976. I am anxious to read it again with adult eyes. You can't go home again, but some reads take you close. The combination of the rustic and ordinary with the surreal in this tale, and the original characters, made this a memorable reading experience. The only book I've read since then that stayed with me this long was Song of Solomon."
3,Too 'tamed' for a 'tiger.',"Maybe it isn't fair; when you're a legend, people expect from you nothing short of perfection. Joni Mitchell isn't quite up to her legendary status. One problem is, sad to say, her voice that allowed her honourary membership in the choirs of angels has faded over the years. She gets by on attitude, particularly in the funny-as-#& ""Lead Balloon,"" or the bitter ""No Apologies."" But, if you remember ""Ladies of the Canyon"" or ""Court and Spark,"" you can see the difference. It's depressing. Her new musical style isn't quite that new, or that thrilling, though it does have some nice textures. Lyrically, she is still far better than average for pop. ""My Best to You"" rings with sincerity. I wish her the best indeed for any future albums. How sad it is to watch a legend, who never got her due rewards during her glory days, fade just as the establishment begins to realise what a treasure she was - and, in some ways, still is."
1,Stay away from this one,"I love Joni Mitchell, I really do. New stuff, old stuff--it's all good. I guess I should say all of it except ""Taming the Tiger."" You know how you have to listen to a CD a couple of times before a few songs stick out as favorites. You listen to it a couple more times, and you like a couple more songs. Not long after, you pretty much like the whole album with a couple of possible exceptions. I am here to say that I have listened to ""Taming the Tiger"" off and on for a year now, trying to make myself like it, and I cannot. It is just bad, really bad. Unless you just have to complete your Joni Mitchell collection, stay away from this one."
1,Part not as shown,"Tried to purchase this part; however, the part shipped was not an idler arm for the Nissan 720 4x4 and looked nothing like the picture at Amazon. The part that shipped looked like a strut mount. Obviously a part for a different vehicle. Amazon quickly shipped a replecement; but, it was also incorrect."
3,An ok book,"This book is an alright quick read. Being that it's 100+ pages it only takes twenty minutes to read. You don't really get your $12.00 worth. It does have a few gigles in it though, especially if your fashion savy."
4,Comfy and cozy,"I bought this for my Baby Jogger. It is a great product, although it contains no instructions and I installed it wrong. I could not figure out why it always slipped down. I contacted Baby Jogger and they told me to thread it through the center grip. And it worked. Love it!"
1,just a gimmick,this is one of those luxery items you pay alot for but didn't see any benefit. Its really useless and a waste of money
3,Not sure if it will hold up,"The bag material is really thick and sturdy. The strap is nice. Unfortunately, it broke the first time I used it! I was flying alone with my son and on our return trip the zipper broke at the airport. When we got home, my husband was able to fix it but we're not sure if the design of the zipper will hold up in the long term. Otherwise, we like it."
5,Sugar Free Cranberry Jello,"I have a super recipe for this product, however it has been discontinued by Jello in the sugar free version. That is what prompted me to buy a case of it. I am a diabetic and this in one product I will definitely miss."
2,Eh...,"The beats on this disc are cool, I agree in that aspect with all the other reviews here. My complaint about this disc is that it is saturated by this whack rap filler that seems to plague half of the hard house out there...it's kind of hit or miss these days. Irene repeatedly tells you how good she is throughout this mix, which to me is a total joke. Nation's number one house ""Diva""? That's laughable. If you want good, hard beats without that Miami rap sound (not that Irene's from Miami, that's just what it sounds like to me...whoomp there it is type of stuff) check out Woody McBride (DJ E.S.P.), Terry Mullan, Laidback Luke.....hey, just my $0.02 worth."
4,super .fi 3,"Great headphones. That said, the bass is a little lacking. I listen to a lot of low stuff (classical, bass trombone, jazz, etc) and so the bottom drops out in the really loud stuff. They take a little getting used to for comfort, but for the noise isolation (27dB) it's worth it for me. i'de buy them again if given the choice over others. another plus is that the cord is replaceable, so if you damage your cords frequently (like me) you don't have to buy new headphones everytime!"
1,Low quality bass,"The bass on these is just not very good. That is why you will see so many reviews on ""flat"" sound. It's like the bass is turned down really low. Many small bug earphones have that same problem and I don't really see much of an advantage over my $15 bud earphones. The music is still tolerable but and I can still use them, but I will give it one star because of the price. $25 or so might be a fair price. I would advise you to avoid this product. With the soft bass, it's just not worth the money. You might be able to use this product if your music does not have any deep sounds, maybe some classical music or other music of the sort."
2,Ear Phones,"I didn't either get a good seal in my ear, or I could still hear the outside noise of the airplane engines."
2,Not for people with small ear canals,Got this but couldn't get a good seal since the plugs were larger than what I wanted.I used the smallest set of plugs but no luck. so I returned it. Great service from Amazon.I had no troubles with return and they made a full refund.Now Im looking for some good ear buds which will fit in to my small ears.
5,"Great vlaue, better sound","Just bought a pair, put them on, and after finding the best position in my ear, and switching to the foam ear pieces, I must say, these headphones rock! Mids are articulate, highs sparkle without being shrill, and the bass is very solid.If you listen to rock, jazz, blues, or classical like I do, these are a top choice. I have not tried any rap/hip hop/house on it but suspect it would be a good choice for those styles as well."
2,Big disappointment,"Good sound quality, but very poorly built by cheap plastic, looks like a $5 earphone for kids. And it does not fit my ears well. I had to return it after trying for less than 1 hour. A big disappointment. I would buy a Shure earphone."
3,"great highs, very weak lows","I tried these out with my Ipod (new Video Ipod), and found that the highs are great. Very bright and crisp. The sound isolation is incredible- almost dangerous. Unfortunitly, the lows are very weak, and the mid range could also use more punch. I tested these againt my cheap Sony MDR-NC5s, and also my normal Polk speackers (which are great). Both sounded better in the low range, with much better bass responce and clarity. I cant recommend these, and am now looking to get something else.By the way, I breifly listened to the super.fi 5s, and was not impressed by them. I they sounded flat to me in the low range as well (but I sure hope they are better becouse of the price)."
3,"Great sound isolation, poor sound reproduction","I purchased these headphones after as a more portable alternative to my Bose headphones. I supposed that sound isolating headphones would be a great alternative to noice-cancelling headphones inasmuch as I would be spending 90 bucks on sound quality rather than noise-elimination technology.These headphones are fantastic for blocking outside noise. Plugged into my computer or iPod, I can hear almost nothing else. The trouble is the sound itself. I listen to hip-hop, rock, and classical music, and in all three, the sound was too bright. Far from flat reproduction, these headphones had far less bass than the (way cheaper) Sony Fontopia buds.A good buy if you're listening to spoken word; for all else, consider something with slightly better bass response."
5,very good table saw,"I highly recommend this saw, it has enough power to do all kind of jobs. I followed other reviewers recommendation to change a better blade and it works smoothly and cut all piece of woods beautifully.thanks homedepot, where I bought this saw, for the coupon I used."
1,Dissaponted. Made in CHINA!!!!,"I was given a Henckels knife set as a gift 15 years ago. Made in germany, love it and use it daily. Figured I'd buy one as a gift. FAIL! Made in china. WTF???? Quality not nearly as good as my old set. I would NOT have purchased this if was clearly stated as made in china and I'm embarrassed to give it as a gift."
3,Didn't fit my needs,This bag was just OK. I found it to be too skinny to be practical as a diaper bag.
3,It's good enough to carry a few essentials,"I was expecting the bag to be a little wider but it fell short on that end. You can only fit a few small essentials. I tried to roll a baby blanket but it was too thick to go into the bag. You will have to take out some of the items in order to get to the other ones at the bottom. I was better off using the free diaper bags they give at the hospital from the baby formula companies. They can fit more things than this bag did. The two top zippered compartments were too shallow for things other than your keys, lipstick, and a small wallet. The bag itself does not have zippered closure so the stuff in it is exposed. Not an ideal diaper bag for a whole day trip out and about."
2,jerry garcia`s finger b-side,"For soundgarden fans that would like to know if the b-side of this single `jerry garcia`s finger` is necessary for their collection, don`t bother. It is not even a song,just noise for a couple of minutes."
1,"I like silly-funny, but this is too stupid.","I can't believe this actually had a 5 star rating. I wouldn't give it 3 if I had a copy to sell! I watched part of each part, then pitched it in the trash. We really need a zero star rating."
4,Hours of the Hours,"This music feels like hours of ""The Hours"" but I agree that for Glass fans there are bound to be nuances that make various parts of this collection more interesting than others. I am not sure I would compare it to a summer's day or the picture on the CD jacket. Is there a postmodern generator on line for this?"
4,You can 'get there from here'.,The folks from Freeport at DeLorme's Publishing have produced an excellent atlas. It shows all the roads in NY state. The atlas is well organized with maps numbered on the back cover so that you can flip to them quickly. Topographic lines are present on the map as are such things as power lines. With one of these you can remove the 60+ NY county maps from your glove compartment and still be able to find your way to any place within the state. I use it to map out cycling routes with my 4H group. My only wish is that gravel roads were marked as such.
5,Good to read,"Good book, drills! The only thing better is thanking a class from him, or a qualified instructor. Like Manny Bragg"
1,Complete waste of money.,"Ordered this product for my wife. Product does not work at all. She reported tingling sensation similar to using burt's bees lip balm, but lips same size as ever. Save your money."
2,Belt clip BROKE after 6 months of use,"Relative to the endless array of other poorly designed cases, this Krusell case in not that bad. However, after 6 months of use the ""Multidapt"" mount broke off the main portion of the case.The case has an inherent design flaw which stems from this single point of failure. If you use the belt clip often, then this weakness can be a major problem.Lifetime Warranty - sending your case in for warranty service or exchange is not practical because this Krusell is based in Sweden, so you must send you case to Sweden for service. The least expensive shipping I can find to Sweden is for about $7."
2,"OK, but not great","Ugly orange trim color might be cool for kids, but looks ridiculous on an adult. Case is bulky and the snaps pop open every time you bump or brush against anything. Sound quality with the case on is ok, but noticeably lower than without the case. Belt clip seems to work ok, however I would much prefer a horizontal clip."
3,Nice case,"Excellant case, only one flaw. When case is on belt, rear camera flap buttons un-snap and phone danglesby flap."
1,Poor quality,The product arrived undamaged and the first time I slipped my 810i in (very tight fit) the seam split up the side. Also the design is cumbersome. The company who sold it provided a different product without any difficulty. They did not even request the slight additional price difference. That was satisfying.
3,Rugged but too bulky,"I am a ""pocket"" phone carrier. I don't care for using the belt clip. That said, this case is too thick to slip in your pocket. It effectively doubles the thickness of the phone even without the clip on. that, and it's so ""grippy"" that you have to struggle to actually pull it out of your pocket. I did try using the belt clip instead, but because of the way the camera flap opens (the belt clip is attached to it), every time you bump into something the case flips open. I would have preferred a slick leather case with no belt clip attachment. If I wasn't so worried about dropping it I might not use anything at all. I don't think the camera flap is worth it. Unless you carry keys and the phone in the same pocket, I don't see it getting scratched. Bummer, this is a great phone but not a lot of case options."
4,The kindergarten students loved it!,I read this book during story time. The kids just loved it. The rhymes are fun and the pictures wonderful. Read it to your children. They will laugh and ask you to read it once more.
5,COZY MUSIC,"One of CP's best albums, every track is great, especially with the awesome SHM. Must have for any CD collection, but don't pay these ridiculous over-inflated rip off prices. I purchased mine from The Music Specialist on E Bay, save yourself a ton of cash!"
1,not a satisfactory replacement for Apple's AC adapter,"Loosely-fitting adapter tips, insufficient voltage and lack of a battery charging indicator make this model a poor value."
4,Pleased,"The Cosco Summit High Back Car Seat arrived in 8 days with regular shipping. Upon opening, the seat was exactly as I had pictured it to be. I had read the previous consumer reviews and was aware of the ""buckle/straps too short"" complaint... and, yes, the strap/buckle could be better redesigned to accommodate growing human legs... but decided that this seat was the best BANG for the buck - $74.54. Which it is.My 2 1/2 year old daughter was filled with glee upon inspection. She exclaimed, ""Look at the sparkles, Momma"". Phew! That hurdle conquered. (I had thought, as I placed my order, that a little girl might not appreciate the practicality of a dark color.) There does, however, exist a ""sparkle"" in the silver metallic fabric that is not visible in the photos available online. She loves her ""big girl car seat"".I hope that I was able to aid you in your quest! :)"
4,Nice Car Seat,"My daughter loves this seat!!! I could barely get it out of the box and she was trying to sit in it. Once I put it together (before actually installing it in the car), my daughter sat in the chair to watch television. We left in on the floor for her until we had to install it in the car. We've already gone on a trip to NY and my daughter was very comfortable. I love the recline feature when she falls asleep. Not a bad price either. The only thing that gave this a 4-star rating was the box was partially opened when it was delivered. After inspecting to make sure there weren't any defects it was fine. Other than that, I would definitely recommend. We plan on buying a second one for Grandma's car!!!"
5,Great resource,"Spiral bound book with maps showing where frogs/toads, salamanders, turtles, lizards, and snakes have been found across Virginia. There are no photographs in here - just maps by species. For the gray tree frog, for example, there is a map of Virginia with the county lines drawn. There are dots on the map showing where the frog has been identified. There's also a small map of the US with the broader distribution of the species shown so you can see how isolated or not the species is. There's just a brief paragraph that tals about the species so you need to look to other books for habitat needs, reproductions, etc. This is a super resouce. I'm really glad I found it as I start getting into amphibian monitoring."
2,Lamp Shade does not fit right,"We ordered the Globe Mirabelle floor lamp (61966), what a good sale price ($35). When we put it together, the lamp shade did not fit right so it is hanging, loosely non-fitting. We don't recommend buying this item unless you are willing to live with the defect!"
1,Very flimsy junk,"After the table collapsed several times, I vowed I would never trust it to hold anything fragile of any value. It simply cannot handle any weight. And when I tried to tighten the legs more, the threads stripped very easily and the table went into the dumpster. Please save your money. This thing is flimsy and shaky and simply of little value holding anything over a pound at the most."
1,Good idea but poor quality,"I used this for the first time in the courtroom for a trial where I wanted to put both the laptop and LCD projector on the table. One of the legs broke when I pulled it out. After I managed to set it up, it was so, unstable I ended up using a table I found in the courtroom. The table is plastic and cheap. You get what you pay for. The only good thing I can say is that the design is good, if only they could make it a better quality, even though it might add some weight to it."
4,Great little table for portable needs,I enjoy this table as a compact table that allows for an easy mobile operation.
1,Table is very unstable,"I bought this table from another vendor (not via Amazon) to use while traveling. I only use it if there is nothinin else available. I commute a great deal to other people's offices or conferences. This table is stable enough for a clipboard w/ sign-up sheets, a water bottle, a roll of paper towels and other small items. I won't put an open cup of coffee or tea on this table. I certainly would not put a laptop on it! One of the legs will not stay locked in the under side of it, so it is very wobbly. Buyer beware!"
4,Works great!,"I got this product for my husband to use in our motorhome with his laptop. It works great! Because the legs are adjustable in height, he is able to sit in any seat and work comfortably. It is very light weight, which is perfect for traveling. It may be a little flimsy, but we will have to wait to see if it stands up. It certainly looks like it will and the design is wonderful."
2,super flimsy,"I was astounded at how flimsy the all-plastic construction was. While that does make it wonderfully light and others are very happy with it, I was looking more for something tiny and modular to use at home, which the Lap Dawg is more suited for."
1,"Flimsy, Poor Product",The table is very flimsy and legs will fall off even when properly installed. The plastic table top is made of a poor plastic material. Do not waste your money on this notebook stand.
4,A History of Women in America,This book was a required reading for a class that I was inrolled. I was required to only read sections. I found this book to be interesting enough I read it from cover to cover.
4,Women's History,I use this book in my AP History class to help students understand the role of Women in US History
5,History of Women in America,The book was in fine shape as advertised and came in a timely manner Thanks.
2,"Good, but........","I am a beginner soap maker and found this book to be extremely informative. There is a great amount of information regarding the different types of oils and additives you can use. But, being a beginnger, I found the recipes waaay to intimidating and extremely large. I almost got turned off of soap making thinking that I would need a scale to measure lye to tenths of grams! (i.e. lye weight 567 7/10 gm) Also her recipes call for you to make batches of at least 40 bars each, an amount I was not interested in making. There is a lot of good information in this book, but I think that this book is for people extremely serious about soap making."
2,Bars and bars and bars of soap,"The only problem I have with this book is the sheer quantity of soap each recipe makes. I have never made 40 bars of soap at one time and cannot imagine ever doing so. I'm not sure what I would do with 40 bars of soap. It's more fun for me to make several small batches of soap for variety. It would have been more helpful had Cavitch included information on making half batches as well.The author uses no animal products in her soap, which may be a plus for some, but I find lard and tallow to make nice soaps for much less money. Of course, this is a matter of preference to the soap maker.Frankly, I wish I had bought another soap making book."
4,This thing is massive!,"I bought the fluorescent yellow 40lb line. It's hard to picture how much line this has until you have it in hand. Almost 3000 yards!It filled 3 of my TLD25 Shimano reels and still has around half of it left.It is a bit stiffer than some higher costing lines, but I have had no issues with breakage, as I did with Berkeley. Also, they Yellow color is easy to spot, and therefore helps me to avoid tangling my line in others while fishing.I would recommend this for spinning reels, as it is too stiff and to thick in Diameter, but for conventional reels, it sure meets my expectations.My only CON would be that the outer layer of the line on the roll was a bit damaged, even though it had protective plastic wrapping. Don't know why, might have been due to poor handling during shipping. I removed the top layer and threw it away. And since I spool my reels manually, I let it slide through my fingers and could feel no damage on the 550-600 yards of line I put on my reels.Happy fishing"
2,Low breaking stregnth,"I have used this line before and was happy with it. The last roll I purchased as 30#, but seemed small diameter so I tested it several times on a scale and found that it broke at 15#. I have had it long enough now that I cannot return it."
3,A good read but not a masterpeice like Forge of God,"The Forge of God was a hard act to follow, being one of the most compelling Sci-Fi novels I've ever read. Even though Anvil of the Stars doesn't quite match it in quality, it still is worth reading in its own right. Greg Bear's wonderful insights in the world of quantum physics are in the forefront of this novel. He takes theories of today and molds them into a multitude of potential culminations in the future. The work is wonderful to read just because of this. The other compelling aspect of this work is the moral delimma thrust in front of the characters and readers. At what point is revenge too high a price, and how do you know when the information used to make decisions is accurate? When do you rely on instinct, and when do you rely on perceived facts? This work is by no means the nail bitter Forge of God is, yet it still is worth reading in its own right."
5,Life and Marriage Changing Book!,Two Becoming One is a life changing book! It truly exhibits the Godly principles that the Bible teaches. The innovative ideas used in this book to improve your marriage really work! Our marriage has greatly improved. Please read this book; your marriage and life will be changed forever!
5,"Wonderful Resource, Full of Wisdom","My boyfriend and I decided to read this book as we are considering marriage. What a blessing! Don and Sally Meredith provide a clear discussion about marriage from God's perspective. The book is grounded in real life situations from their own marital shortcomings and successes and rooted plainly in the Word of God. This book is not wordy or over the top, so it is an easy read; but the words themselves are a mirror into how you view marriage and how that might be the source of pain and problems for you and your spouse. Looking in that mirror may be hard. I would recommend this book to couples considering marriage, newly weds and seasoned couples, no matter how problem-free you believe your relationship is. I believe that at any stage of marriage a couple can extract important tools for success from this book. Two... Becoming One will stay on my shelf as a reference for years!"
1,Not Impressed,"I bought this hard case to help protect my Treo during a fall. My Treo has had to falls, both times the case pops open and the phone came out onto the ground.The case doesn't open all the way, makes it a little difficult to get phone in and out, unless of course it's dropped onto the ground.Bottom Line: I will start looking for another case to buy that works better, especially staying closed when it hits the ground."
5,The best album ever ?,"This, Elliott Smith's fifth cd, is possibly his best album yet. There is nary a bad track among them. Each has it's own charms to it. The album starts off with a bang (""Son of Sam"") and ends in melancholy piano (""Bye"") and each track in between is intricately performed. This is one of my favorite albums of all time. It would make the perfect christmas gift for anyone, I guarantee satisfaction."
3,Feeling a little burned.,"Heard the wonderful Smith cut ""Figure 8"" on the radio and rushed out immediately to pick up this disk... assuming, of course, that the song was on the CD of the same name. Wrong. The song ""Figure 8"" only appears on the $33 import version. This CD is called ""Figure 8"" just for the heck of it, apparently. Nice."
1,only one,"you only need to have one elliot smith record in your collection--and this ain't it, baby! yawn, yawn, yawn. here's a guy who keeps making the same record over and over. take a break, el: maybe try and get into a little sly and the family stone or something. everyone i know in hipster silver lake even is sick of your whispering wimperings. pass!"
4,Continues to be strong,"A great follow up to XO. Once again, Elliott shows us what john Lennon would have sounded like if he were a better pianist, not to mention alive. The songs aren't quite as complicated as on XO, but all are strong offerings of Smith's style. Particularly memorable is the ragtime influenced ""Angelina."""
4,Very stupid but Very amusing!,"If you're looking for a really dumb, gore flick The Gore Gore Girls is hilarious and right up your alley. Strippers are being killed in very amusing & gory ways. Although it is ""gory"" it is gory in the green pea puke from Exorcist sort of way. In other words it's obvious they use plastic body parts etc. Not scary at all and I scare pretty easily. Also be prepared for some horribly bad but funny one-liners from the lead investigator. Overall it's a pretty amusing cult film."
1,"The first, and probably last, HG Lewis film I'll ever see.....","This is the only Herschell Gordon Lewis film I've seen, and it will be the only one. It's pretty awful. I rented it because HG Lewis fans swear this is the best one, but it's just crappy, and, no, not good crap. The gore is actually pretty fake looking, and the performances here are damn abysmal. You're not expecting grade A award winning material here, but dammit it should be at least passable. The plot is just another run of the mill serial killer plot. There's really nothing worth seeing here. It was a chore to sit through this, but it taught me something worthwhile. I'm not a fan of Lucio Fulci, but his films are better than this one. I never thought I would say/write that."
2,PLEASE VULNERABLE SOULS READ THIS,"I have not seen the dvd edition of this film, in fact i have not watched it in years, but I have to add my voice to the reviews, This is a seriously scary film. it totally warped my brain when I saw it 6 years ago and I have still not recovered from watching it. I love my gore and gruesome films but this film did something awful to my mental health. If you are of a strong mental type then go ahead and watch it, HG Lewis never intended that his films would warp people but this film will never leave me. Even if it is wanky ancient special effects, the sheer brutality of this film is not to be underestimated. If you can handle it - go ahead by all means. I wish I could do so. But if you are a troubled soul don't bother. I have lasting nightmares.Even if HG Lewis didn't intend it, thats how it is........"
1,Banned in Australia?,"This film has been banned in Australia and will not have a dvd release. How the censorship board could find a badly made horror film from 1972, too graphic for public consumption is confusing. This film plays more like a comedy because of the bad production values (yes gore also), why is this unavailable to adults? Yes, there is violence against women, but have the censors seen the brutal violence on display in ""Irreversible""? Have they released the dvd? Yes!What is happening to our freedom of choice?"
3,Great to have it remastered and anamorphic ... but it's missing footage!!!,"In Trinity is Still My Name, there is a missing scene where Trinity, Bambino and his mother and father are having dinner and his father tells them they ought to get married. He then proceeds to tell them how he met their mother and she preens as he does this. Well ... that story of how he met their mother is NOT in this version. Which is tragic. I'm going to have to see what else is missing. After waiting for decades for the remastered widescreen release ... it's wildly disappointing that scenes are missing that were in the far far far inferior fullscreen versions that preceeded it. Still it's nice to see it in anamorphic."
2,Bad Luck,"We bought this twin pack along with ""My Name Is Nobody"".We watched ""They call me Trinity"" and ""My Name Is Nobody"" but never got around to watching ""Trinity is still My Name"" until last week.That's when we discovered the DVD was defective and will not work on any of the two DVD players or the computer.The Return Window expired on March 26, 2011.Wish we would have tested it sooner, I would have never suspected a DVD being defective when it's brand new. There's not a scratch on it but it doesn't work. :("
3,Not water resistance,"The watch is very nice & sharp looking. BUT, it says its water resistance. I bought it for my 16 yr. old daughter for christmas, when she washed her hands with it on, guess what happened. That's right, it got water all in it. It took it about a week to dry out. I don't consider that water resistance."
2,"It's was a hit, but didn't work!","This was a great gift for my father, who loves fishing, but he couldn't get his computer to recognize the software.....therefore, never used it. We were all bummed!"
2,Pretentious,Book is simply the cutting and pasting from other sources. It is poorly exposited and the language is too chatty to be relevant to serious scientists.
5,The best book for asset pricing,"I don't understand what those people leaving bad reviews really want from an asset pricing book. It's sad that the average review is lower than 4 so far. For those guys who want to find some cookbook for asset pricing, I should say: it's not suitable for you, but it doesn't mean it's not good.This is definitely the best asset pricing book I've ever read. I want to give it a 10 out of 5.It tries to put all the asset pricing issues in a single framework, which makes the topic much more interesting and much easier to understand.It is a very useful book for the finance academicians. I became a fan of John Cochrane because of this book."
2,Hides complexity,"I have just finished studying the first, theoretical, part of this book and it was a maddening experience. The problem is that Cochrane tries too hard to make things appear simpler than they are. In particular, when using random variables he switches without much warning between treating them just like scalars and treating them as members of a vector space. When doing the latter he does not explicitly mention that the inner product he is using is x.y = E(xy) and not the usual Euclidean dot product. The proofs are sketchy and full of hand-waving. With enough care and effort and a sufficiently thorough mathematical background you can convince yourself that everything turns out to be right at the end, but if you are going to put in that much of an investment you may as well read Duffie'sDynamic Asset Pricing Theorywhich is much more precise."
4,Pretty good book but a little bit of an informal approach,"I finished my second pass of Cochrane's Asset Pricing recently, and this book certainly reads a lot smoother (easier) than most other graduate texts. This may partly be because it's my second time reading it, but it may also be because of the sometimes informal approach that Cochrane takes. If you are looking for a different approach or a unified approach to asset pricing, then this book may be for you. Cochrane uses the p=E(mx) formulation that prices assets using the payoffs and a stochastic discount factor and tries to go back to this relation throughout his book. He also promotes the Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) approach and provides decent arguments for why this approach should be used. He does a decent attempt to show that the different methods of time series and cross-sectional regression, including GMM, end up doing the same thing."
3,cutting edge but difficult to follow,"This book is obviously cutting edge, and the style is easy to read, but as another reviewer said, Cochran just does not connect the dots. I am using it in a masters level class right now, and the professor hands out his own explanations each week that help to fill in some of the many holes. But it is still so easy to miss a small detail and remain completely lost despite reading it over and over.The positive reviews are likely from people who knew a lot of the content before hand and appreciated the unified theory approach that brought their knowledge all together. Students on the other hand will not appreciate this book until they are at a fairly advanced level already."
1,Complete Junk - Don't Waste Your Money!,"I tried to update the 2006 software. Customer service had no idea how to do that and bounced my call around from person to person. I finally gave up. More recently, my GPS stopped working. It cannot locate any satellites and my map is frozen someplace in New York (I've never been there). When I called customer service, they told me that it would cost $69 just to diagnose the problem! I was also told that parts and additional labor would cost more. They could not provide any estimate on total cost. Why on earth would I spend this sort of money if they can't fix it? Further, why spend money on a GPS system that has outdated maps? I called LG in Huntsville, AL to issue a complaint and sent them emails. They have not returned my inquiries. Terrible customer service! Don't waste your money. After this experience, I will never buy a product from LG. Don't buy from a company that doesn't stand behind it's products."
2,Good Scanner but Printing is a problem,Ive had the printer for about a year. I mainly need it for printing black and white and scanning. At first the printer worked great. About 6 months later I noticed that the print quality was degrading. Everything had those horizontal streaks. Even after cleaning the printer heads I still get them. Forget about color prints. Colors are faded and washed out. It didnt matter if I used color photo paper.So far the scanner is the only thing still works well. I dont do much copying but since it requiers to print it wont be useful.Its the old saying you get what you pay for.
4,Good for Young Children,"This is a very cute book that introduces some of the basic items of Shabbat. It is a durable board book with full color pictures on each page. Overall, it is a good item. However, there could have been more detail and explanation. The children shown in the book seem older than the appropriate age (preschool) of children who would get the most use out of the book."
4,shabbat board book,"This is a great book, great pictures. I would reccomend this book for children 3yrs and up. There is quite a bit of text in it. I thought there would be just pictures. Oh well, I will save it for my daughter when she is a bit older."
2,NOT For Beginners,"If you are new to woodworking dont buy this book. This is for a master wood worker trying to make speciality items. Some have sent in reviews on it being for a beginner...WRONG!!! I needed to know the basics of a router how to use different bits, adjusting height etc etc. Sorry but this book was not for me..."
5,What a great book!,"This is fun to read. The drawings are detailed and the writing is very well written. There are so many things that I learned by reading this book. It will make you say...""Why did I not think of that before."" I have a very good amount of wood working experience and was pleased by how much knowledge this book dropped on me.It will open your mind up to possibilites not just limited to Routers. Even if you have no plans to build any of the jigs, you will certainly learn to think about fabricating other things in your shop to make wood working more accurate.At less than $12, its hard not to cough up the money for the many hours of reading and brainstorming you will get back from the book-Jason"
4,I made the router table described,"I hate using other people's plans, but in this case I made an exception since I liked the look and function of the table. The author describes how to make many useful jigs, but some just aren't necessary if you have other tools besides a router. As a result, you can spend alot of extra time making jigs that you really don't need to use and add to the time to complete the project. Overall, there are some great ideas here."
4,great magazine,"lots and lots of advertising in this magazine, super fun to get ideas from the clothes and photo shoots even if the clothes are way out of my budget"
2,English Yiddish Dictionary,"This dictionary had fewer definitions than I had expected. It is helpful, but not as much as I had hoped for."
5,Childrens dvd,"all I can say is I am looking forward to watching my 20 month old enjoy this movie, I see no reason it won't be enjoyed for hours and hours at a time."
3,stylish but annoying,"The look of these cufflinks are nice but because the globe spins, they are difficult to manipulate when putting on."
2,Sketchers thong,"I love Skechers, but this thong developed a hole in it's sole and a small pebble slipped inside the hole. I was shuffling along with a clink, clink, clink sounding in each step. I have had better Skecher products!!!"
1,Auricular Therapy: A Comprehensive Text,"As a nurse, let alone as a lay person, this book is so technical and full of very poorly unlabled picture diagrams including the fact that all the color coded shaded picture diagrams are printed in black and white, makes it impossible to relate to the reading/studying of this book. Even when used with the Auricular Therapy Reflex Chart it is very difficult to comprehend. I have studied many medical books in my career and this was one of the poorest I have ever dealt with. I was exteremly disappointed in this book and would not recommend it!"
2,Used. NOT COMPLETE. Improperly boxed.,"Shipped almost loose, very little packing, no usb cord and no key. I can tell by the serial number this unit is very old, very very old. Not up to Amazons standards."
1,Disappointed,"Strengths: noneWeaknesses: Bulky,poor noise suppression,Augment internah hissSummary: I received these head phones 2 days ago.I am not impressed with the quality.Internal noise like tape hiss or hard disc rotation are magnified much more than the useful audio.External noise suppression is not too great either.I tried these with washing machine running in next room ,the noise was suppressed about 50%.But not bad for this price."
3,"Should be named ""Noise Reduction Headphones""","It's really 3.5 STARS. This unit is nice for after-rebate price. The headphone sounds ok, can't compare with my Denon of course. But the so call ""Noise Cancelling"" is really just cancelling out about 25% of the noise (50% the MOST.) I won't call it ""Noise Cancelling"" but more of a ""Noise Reduction"" headphone. I guess you get what you pay for. :)"
4,No specifications re product,what is the decibel range? What is the distortion rate? What is the frequency range? With so little information given it is not possible to compare this product with other similar products such as the Sony Noise-Canceling Folding Headphones or the Aiwa Noise-canceling Folding Headphones.
2,Kensington noise cancelling headphones 33084,"Headphone is compact and comfortable. Most of the reviews I read before purchasing were from users who traveled often. Reviews were mostly good.I use them for environmentss I 'm in to reduce the noise level(library,family watching TV or talking too much).What i was looking for were headphones not for music but phones without caacbles to plug in. Decibels rated at 6. Have a 2nd paair from GE. 30dcb raring & they work. Can hardly hear outside noise unless it is very loud. Problem is they are bulky , can't use for sleeping-bulky,not comfortable for long periods of time.Really need light,easy wearing,good noise reduction."
4,One of the best purchases I made,"I love these. I never had noise cancelling headphones before so I assume Bose is the best but these will do nicely thank you and so light on my head, such a comfort. I hear the music so well and it does block out a lot of noise.Wearing them everywhere, even fell asleep with them on. It feels sometimes like I have nothing on my head. Buy these, you won't be disappointed."
4,Pretty good headphones,I'm mostly satisfied with the perfomance of these headphones. I wish they could mute the screaming kids from outside but I can't have everything I guess.
1,"All headphones, No Noise-Cancelling","I would actually give these a 1.5 stars, seeing as how the first day I owned them they seemed to work decent. I was ready to give them a rave review but on the second day came the clicks. Basically, and I know this sounds weird, these headphones click nonstop when you aren't holding your iPod. The second that you pick up your iPod, they stop. I'm assuming its an electrical/static issue within the headphones, but it will soon drive you crazy. I've used them at home with my laptop and they seem to work moderately well but if they don't work on my main music device, then they're more or less useless to me. The ear pieces could be a little larger, and the ""noise cancelling"" actually blocks about a third of noise at most.If you are still debating buying these, let me put it this way: I bought these and now I'm back in the market for a set of noise cancelling headphones."
1,Listen to the reader from Earth,"Gadalla is to history what Goebbels was to history. This mess must have been self-published (I gather that's true, based on his website), and a read of its pages should give hope to any aspiring author. If this stuff made it into print, nearly anything can.Impressionable readers will no doubt like it, in the same way that impressionable readers (at first) liked Von Danniken's ""Chariots of the Gods"".If you enjoy ancient history and chronology revisions, get ""Ages in Chaos"" or ""Oedipus and Akhenaten"" by Immanuel Velikovsky, David Rohl's ""Pharaohs and Kings"", or Peter James' ""Centuries of Darkness""."
4,Incredible album,"This is a really incredible album. It shows that Bahamadia's still got it after her widely-praised-by-the-underground/hip hop heads effort ""Kollage"". Great songs. My favorite songs are ""Beautiful Things"" (which is one of my favorite songs of 2000), ""Commonwealth (Cheap Chicks)"" (which has a crappy video that doesn't fit the original integrity of the song), ""Philadelphia"" (with its melodic, dreamlike rhythm) and basically every song from beginning 'til end. It's worth the purchase. She represents the Illadeph side nicely."
5,great jazzy soulfull ep from hiphop's most gifted female mc,THIS EP IS SO TIGHT I LISTEN TO IT EVERY DAY. i CAN NOT GET ENOUGH OF THE BB QUEEN. i JUST WISH THAT SHE IT WAS A BIT LONGER BUT ITS HOT NONE THE LESS. THIS FIRST TRACK IS A LITTLE HARD BUT THE REST IS JUST LAID BACK JAZZ HEAVEN. PHILLY IS DEFINETLY DOING ITS THING. MUCH RESPECT TO THE BB QUEEN
4,The Next Great Thing!,"Mr. Avery has definitely written a powerful and passionate novel that should be read by everyone. It is rare to find an author blessed with the gift of writing with a stylistic and nuanced technique so developed that the reader becomes a part of the story. There is a huge difference between telling a story and painting a picture and Mr. Avery is masterful at ""showing"" and not ""telling.""I Wrote This Song is a MUST read. This novel deals with the gamut of human emotions and creates real characters with real issues that are treated with finesse and grace. Love is always a complicated and complex conundrum of emotions and Mr. Avery vividly shows the duality of love: its beauty as well as its uncanny ability to hurt. In the end, the heart will always love what it loves...Mr. Avery makes me proud to be a writer. Don't miss out on I Wrote This Song.Lee Hayes, author of Passion Marks."
5,YOU'VE GOT TO GET THIS!,"Denver definitely wrote No One and On the Wings of an Eagle, and Four Strong Winds. I'm only halfway through listening and I love it! His voice is clear and resonant. Classic Denver. Just classic."
4,I vote for Four Strong Winds,"John Denver's cut of ""Four Strong Winds"" is one of the truest recordings of that song by anybody. I'd place it with the evocative cover byJudy Collins. It captures the mood differently than the breezy strong duet ofNeil Youngwith Nicolette Larson. It's much more interesting than all the many 1960's folk versions, even the original byIan and Sylvia-- and yes, even the one byThe Chad Mitchell Trio.As for the rest of the album, it's fine and special. Because most of the songs were recorded in different years, with different musicians, in different studios, it is left to John Denver to provide consistency and over the dozen years here he does very well. It is indeed jarring when the ballads give way to the ouside enthusiasm of the funny rowdy songs but that's why we have shuffle. Although I LIKE those cowboy songs. It's a good collection and I'm glad to have it."
5,BOB'S BEST,"I have always liked Bob, I have been a fan of his since his day's with the great Muddy Waters. This is his second solo album, It has an all-star line up of old members of Muddy's band's. Including : Jimmy Rogers, Kim Wilson, Pinetop Perkins, Willie ""Big Eyes"" Smith & Calvin ""Fuzz"" Jones, all that is missing is Muddy himself. That is where Bob picks up he plays slide like a mad man, they say his seven years with Muddy he learned more than any one else about Muddy's style. This is Chicago blues at it's best, Bob's vocals fit right in. The songs and players are superb, this is very hard to find on cd. It came out in 1990 on cd, so it was an excellent find for me. It also is a long player, I have all of Bob's cd's this is the best so far, I also think (Up & In) is great, both worth a listen."
1,Stopped working after two years with infrequent use,"Bought this item in March 2010 to trim my hairline after cutting my hair.Used this item six times a year for a total of 12 times.In June 2012, I turned it on and there is only a hum. The trimmer does not function. Completely dead.This trimmer gave me a warning a few months back. When I turned it on there was only a hum. But after turning it on several times it worked again.This time though, it is COMPLETELY DEAD. So it costs $50.00 for 12 uses, i.e. $4.16 per haircut."
4,Okay,"Way better than my normal trimmers. Although they did heat up pretty quickly, the overall performance were okay. They cut really neat and clean."
2,AA_Not To Good,Work Good For The First Time Blade Did Not Last And Machine Running Hot After Five Minute And Very Noisy.
3,Just okay,"Not exactly what I was looking for in a trimmer, a bit difficult to use and heats-up too fast. Should have selected a model with adjustable guides."
4,Very good,"This product is high quality.I only have a couple of comments that may be noticed by non-pro customers:1. It has a lot of vibration.2. The edges of the blades are kind of pointy so it may scratch your skin (not enough to cut your skin), nothing pretty serious.Besides the two comments, it is a pretty good product.I have used it 3 times, and have no problems at all."
4,Andis Outliner 11,"I am a barber located in the state of Maryland. I ordered the Andis Outliner 11 as an addition to other clippers that I use in my business. They were advertised as new and unused. When I received them, they were just as stated...new and unused. They arrived on time and I was very pleased with the seller and the product. I would order again from the same seller without thought. As far as the Outliner 11 is concerned, it is a professional, good quality clipper and it does a good job depending on the blade that comes on it...all blades, even from the same manufacturer, just don't cut the same. The Andis Outliner 11 is prefered by some barebers but not by all. The clipper that a barber uses is a ""Personal Preferece Thing."" For an example, the Andis Outliner 11 is a heavy clipper and not prefered by some barbers."
4,Perfect for what I want,I needed a shaver that what light weight and would give me a close shave. This product was perfect for that
3,Review of Skateboard Game,This was a Christmas gift for my son. He seems to enjoy the game but sometimes becomes frustrated when he doesn't advance the levels as quickly as he would like but that is typical behavior for him. I do not regret the purchase and feel that I received like value for the amount paid.
2,Not what I expected,I purchased this for my son for Christmas. He has never really played with it much at all. It does not respond as I think it should to the skateboard you are standing on. The graphics aren't great either. All in all it was a disappointment. Don't expect it to be anything like the WI
5,Little expensive but buy only this,This is a little expensive bat but excellent quality. With this I also got a Pro Impact Practice bat but that was hopeless. All i can say is don't even think twice. Just buy this. it's excellent.
5,If only more parents knew this information.....,Great book. Great resource for parents who desire alternative options to the regular standard of care in the US today which focuses on covering up symptoms instead of dealing with causes.
5,This is a book I wish my parents had known.,"If you felt suspicious of certain doctor's practices, You may have been right all along. Dr. Mendelsohn does a very thorough job of exposing questionable practices and needless risks and why these are still around. His true greatness shines when he admits to his own doctoring business as usual and how he himself learned to do more with less (drugs, that is). In clear words he tells how much diagnostic value parental observation actually has and when to see a doctor urgently. If you have children or if you foresee to create bodies for them, or if you just know someone who would benefit from healthy advice, learn more and enjoy this classic. A true gift."
3,"Great starting point, but needs updating","This book raises a lot of important questions that parents should ask themselves in respect to children's healthcare, and I found it to be a good starting point for further research on important topics. HOWEVER, please be aware that this was published in the 80's and has not been revised/updated. I did not notice that until after I received the book, and I found that disappointing. None of the reviews I read on this book mentioned this, and I think it's an important point. So much further research has been done in many of the areas this book discusses (vaccinations, for example). The book is a quick read and contains a lot of thoughtful information and advice, but I wouldn't recommend it if you are looking for the latest (or even recent) research."
5,Parents must read to protect your children from pharmakeia,Any parent that wants to stay away from medicating their child and have as little medical intervention as possible....this book is a must read....we give out hundreds of his books a year to our practice members.
2,Poor excuse for night-time reading...,"This book is pulp waste...it may be OK for some, but I found it to be rather dull. There's got to be better erotic reading out there."
2,Wasn't for me.,"This CD wasn't for me, I'm a more hard-trance fan. This CD had a more Disco feeling, and I wasnt feeling the trance songs on it. Please buy mine from me, please.."
2,Works but cheap lid,"It works, but the lid is quite cheaply made and seems easily breakable. It is a plastic lid which I didn't realize when I ordered it because it says ""chrome plated""."
1,Choose another seller,"Bait and switch. Ordered one color, Deerso sent another. Deerso is unwilling to pay shipping charges. Deerso should be removed from Amazon."
5,Unbelievable one man show,This a great DVD to have in your media library. James Earl Jones in SUPER. It also gives a great perspective on the actor Paul Robeson and his challenges and convictions.
1,Worthless,"I'm headed to the store today to buy some Duracell rechargeables to replace these useless ones. I have recharged them a few times now (the light on the charger goes out when they're fully charged), and they have yet to last more than about 15 minutes in my mini-cam. The Kodak rechargeables that that camera came with get about two hours of use before needing a charge. Save your money - do NOT buy these!"
5,Great Remote,"I've used this several times since I bought it and it is excellent. I'm usually about 40 feet away from the receiver on my computer and it works with no problem, It flips through slides seemlessly. The features on it are underrated as well. I can setup the presentation ahead of time and blank the screen with the remote then just bring it on when I'm ready. The laser pointer also comes in handy. It's everything I needed"
3,"Decent funnel, but leaks slightly","This funnel has great functionality for its price, but it leaks a little bit when mating some of the pieces together. It is designed such that you can combine various pieces together depending on your demands, but not all of them mate perfectly so things can get messy if you are not careful!"
5,FAR BETTER THAN WARCRAFT,"This is an excellent game, far better than warcraft and other fantasy RTS types. Very creative units, an excellent story, fine graphics and the unique aspect of the underground make this probably the best fantasy RTS out there."
1,FLIMSY MATERIAL,"I searched high and low for a large trunk organizer with a closing lid for my car. I discovered 99% of all trunk organizers are without closing lids. After seeing this one and reading the reviews, I decided to order it. What a big mistake I made. The materials are very flimsy especially on the top. In fact, one side of the top of the tote by the zipper was partially ripped when I received it. Now you would think seeing the rip would have made me immediately return the item. Instead, I made a bigger mistake by procrastinating and now too much time has passed for me to return the tote. So, please save yourself time and expense by not ordering this item."
5,Seinfeld rules!,This recording of Jerry Seinfeld is so funny that you will love the guy even more than you already are. A great example of Seinfeldism.
5,Awesome book!,This book was kind of sad and funny but the ending was great! I must admit that i cried a little! oops! It really made me think of my family and how truly lucky mankind is to have such a wonderful blessing in life. Great book!!!
1,Not as described - neither dual-link nor DVI-I,"I had to return this cable (relatively painless through Amazon). This cable is neither dual-link nor DVI-I. It has 24 pins but some must not be connected because I wasn't able to get the max resolution needed for my 27"" LCD using this cable. It acted like a single link DVI-D cable. With a proper dual-link cable from a different source, I was up & running at 2560x1440 as required. Although I didn't need the DVI-I capability, this cable didn't have the typical 4-pin DVI-I configuration either, so be warned."
4,Works perfectly,"I purchased these to use with my multi monotor set up using eyefinity. The cables are heavy duty, and very well constructed. The connectors hold firmly, and the screw posts are long enough that tightning them is not an issue. There is no noticable signal degradation to my 23"" HD monitor. The picture is crisp and clear."
5,DVI Dual Link Cable,"Prior to using these cables on my widescreen monitor, I used VGA cables. The images and fonts on my monitor always had a slight ghosting effect that I wondered if it was caused by electronic interference from the other equipment in my room. It was not enough to ruin the picture, but enough to mar what the monitor was capable of producing. But once I attached the DVI-I Dual Link cable, the ghosting disappeared and everything was sharp as a tack. It was great to see that a simple cable change cleared up the image instead of it being something much more expensive."
1,Please don't buy this old book with a new title.,"If even one person is fooled into buying this book then it is a shame. This book is the Footprints of God book that Iles released a few years ago. Iles is probably one of my favorite authors and all of his books are great, except this one. I don't know whose idea it was to rerelease an old book with a new title to try and sucker people into buying the same book twice. I hope it wasn't the author's idea. In conclusion, this is a rerelease of ""The Footprints of God,"" written only a few years ago."
2,Disappointed,"We purchased this a while ago and slept on it maybe a total of 10 times. We had it packed away safely in storage for a while.When we took it out again to use, it deflated in the middle of night. Wish these were made better."
2,Goes Flat,"I don't know if we got a bum deal or what, but this twin mattress by Greatland is flat by morning. Who wants to wake up on an air mattress that's 70% deflated? Not me. Good if you want to hint to your houseguest that it's time to go."
5,Great for the boards and the office,I bought this to study for the pediatric boards and it was very helpful for the picture session. I've also found it extremely helpful everyday in seeing patients especially the dermatology section.
4,Way OVERPRICED!!!,"This is a good product, but way overpriced!!!I used to live in So. Cal. and got married and moved to AK with my military husband. I used to get twice as many for about half the price in my local Pavilions supermarket."
4,Life in the foreign service,"I have been thinking about joining the U.S. Foreign Service and this first-hand account was absorbing and illuminating. I found the personal insight into an often challenging and dangerous career most impressive. It is written in a forthright manner with welcome touches of humor. I would recommend this book to anyone interested not only in traveling and working abroad but also to those who have already done so. It is also for those who like adventures and enjoy autobiographies. More from this author, please!"
1,Gross Fantasy Unrelated to Description,I was interested based on the description. An end of the world story... what I got was a bunch of non-topical man checking women out and much worse treatment to women that was pointless and didn't at all further the plot of the story.Much better end of the world battle stories out there. Go look for those.
1,"Wow, this book really sucks!","This inane, silly novel begins slowly and and then proceeds to go downhill. If you are into cartoonish, unrealistic sex, this novel is for you. All the characters act and sound the same. The science in this novel is ridiculous, and the preposterousness of the ending will simply annoy you. This is one of those books that you wished that you had never invested any time or money in. Since I cannot get back my time or money, I can at least warn other readers how bad this book truly is. Enjoy!"
2,"Ok, not interesting enouhg for my 3-year old","We purchased this book for my 3-year old who was about to start therapy and it didn't seem to have any impact. The book didn't capture the attention of my 3-year old so I guess it may be better suited for an older child. The pictures and story are dull and boring, the exact opposite of what a young child wants to see."
3,3 1/2 stars,"its pretty good.my previous fifa game was fifa 2002, and to be honest, 2002s graphics are as good or better than 2005s.also, the menus are probably the worst ever. why cant they just use a simple layout like 2002 and 2002 world cup? it was so much easier to use. Dont get me wrong though. its a very ogod game, and if youre going to get a soccer game, this is defintely the one to get."
5,This book is a gem,"This is one of my favorite books in the genre of literary biography. I found the details to be fascinating and Wise's life to be quite bohemian and a fascinating study. For me, it WAS a page turner and worthy of anyone's time. In fact, I chose to use it as the basis for an hour long presentation for various book clubs. Everyone was familiar with GoodNight Moon and enjoyed hearing about Wise's life. I heartily recommend this book. It's just that good."
4,Very good companion as you learn to plan your program design,"I enjoyed this book, it presented ideas on how you can plan program designs more accurately. While you need to have a basic knowledge of programming the text is still valuable to a novice programmer."
5,Blues at it's finest!,TRACK LISTING:1. When I Get Drunk2. Cancel My Reservation3. Something's On My Baby's Mind4. Heaven Of My Own5. Let Me Love You6. Highway 497. No More Cherry Rose8. Have You Ever Wanted Someone9. Papa's Little Angel10. New York Woman
1,I'm returning it,"I am so disappointed in this book, I am returning it. My primary reason? The authors keep mentioning 100 trigger foods that the ALCAT tests for, yet they never provide this list. Why not? Because this book is simply a marketing vehicle to get people to order the test through their lab."
1,Worst Of The Series,"I just watched Wrong Turn 5: Bloodlines, and I have not been this mad after watching a horror movie since I watched The Human Centipede 2. Just like The Human Centipede 2, all Wrong Turn 5 has on its feeble little mind is torture and human suffering. It starts off okay, but gets worse from there. There are plenty of dumb character moves in this movie. I swear, the dumbest characters to ever appear in a horror movie are in this movie. And worst of all, there is no justice in this movie. I sincerely hope there isn't a Wrong Turn 6. I might be tempted to watch it. Movies like this make me want to swear off horror movies completely. I feel like I need to watch some comedies after this!"
1,Probably the stupidest movie ever made,Whatever you do do not watch this POS movie. I cannot begin to explain what a waste of money and time this movie is. STAY AWAY. You are welcome
1,One of the worlds worst!,"This movie was unbelieveable in every way. Truly a waste of time. Stick with the first 4. You really didnt care about any of the actors. The story was just 'Yuck' and this movie just went for the gore. The plot was so thin u could barely see it. The one and only bright thing in this is Doug Bradley (Hellraisers). So if you want to see him, then watch it. But other than that, this last one looks like a Syfy channel saturday night movie, something to watch when you are bored and nothing else is on tv."
4,About what was can be expected from a wrong turn movie.,"You can't go into watching a Wrong Turn Movie and expect Oscar worthy material. Take this for what it is, a silly movie with lots of blood and carnage. The plot, much like the other wrong turn films takes a back seat to the trio of mutant hillbillies.For the budget that this film had, the effects are done rather well, with only a few CGI misses, but overall pretty well done. The acting is terrible, but you can't expect top notch acting on a wrong turn movie. (although Doug Bradley...as always it awesome)No, it's not a good movie but it's a bad good movie, and if you've seen the previous entries in the series, and enjoyed them, then you will enjoy this. If you loathed the others, then this will not change your mind."
3,So So,I am a horror movie fan and love thrillers. This is Wrong turn 5 though? Almost like when one to many sequels are made it sort of turns a little too much in the end. The first couple movies are very good.. after wrong turn 2 it sort of turned sour! Good luck.
1,horrible,Im a huge horror movie fan I got hooked on the first couple wrong turns. The first two were the best the 3rd was fine but you could see they were on a low budget. The 4 and this movie the5 were horrible. The acting is bad and the story line is just the same as all the others
1,Horrible,Do not order this movie it was not good at all. Some parts were ok but overall a waste of money.
1,Dont Waste Your Money,"Complete garbage , i dont know why i do this to myself they just keep getting worse and worse. this one by far was the worse , they really did a crappy child like mask for the hill billys and not as detailed as they are remembered but yet its supossed to be the same rednecks. Trash Trash Trash"
2,TIME TO MAKE A RIGHT TURN,"THE Producers should get a map and get back on the right road, Although I am a fan of the wrong turn movies, it is time to move on to something else if this is the best they can do. Got up midway to go pop some popcorn thinking I wouldn't miss much and the popcorn might enhance my viewing pleasure-Didn't work."
2,Not what I was looking for,I was looking for a man's watch that was not large. I purchased this one thinking that it would be the right size. I was larger and heavier that I would have thought. I returned this item.
1,"Gangsta Boo flows good with everyone else, why not on hers.",Just thought i'd say how much i hated this cd im not saying i hate gangsta boo just this album it wasnt worth putting out its worthless it didnt sell much i guess ya just gotta be a fan of three 6 mafia and all the members to like everything commin' outta the camp where dem dollas at was an okay single but i actually enjoy the remix better.This is just my opinion though.thanx for listening.
4,Very detailed account of the Klondike Gold strike,"Klondike Fever is a very detailed account of the events in and around the gold strike in the Klondike area and the development of the surrounding area. If you are interested in the history of this area this is an excellent book. For some, this book may be to detailed."
3,More Fun that the California Gold Rush,"A lost piece of history, this was just as interesting as the California Gold Rush, as the weather was even a greater hurdle to be overcome. Every kind of character imaginable. They don't make men like that anymore!"
1,not my cup,"Great DVD if secularist propaganda appeals to you. However, I'm not a member of that choir."
1,THIS PRODUCT IS WASTE OF TIME & MONEY,"The engineering team who developed this product should be lynched for allowing such a phiss poor quality product be released to the public.The reception is just plain & simply put - TERRIBLE !!, (if you can get any reception at all) I've tried everthing to get a decent picture for my delivery truck but NO GO ! I am a experienced technician and take it from me--- this product STINKS like a skunk. At first I thought the product was defective, that's how bad the image reception works. The picture is not that bad for the few seconds you have a picture-----but you can NEVER get a stable video screen. It rolls, blacks out, it's snowy, grainy & noisy. You loose the picture constantly-------It does everything but what it is suppose to do. BIG TIME WASTE OF MONEY & WASTE OF MY TIME to install this piece of carp. THUMBS DOWN TIMES 1000.........."
2,Not quite there yet.,Bought the unit to use on the back on my 5th wheel trailer. I realized that this is beyond the range of the unit (6 meters) but I though I'd give it a try. Set up was fairly easy. I ran the power through the license plate light. Unit does not have enough range to go beyond say 25 ft. I'm suprised that the guy who has the motor home got that good of reception. I didnt. They shoud have added an additonal antena on the camera or the monitor. If you do get a picture it is grainy and noisy. Use only for small cars or SUV's. Dont use for RV's.
4,review of backup camera,I have one of these and I order this for my son-in-law so he could use it to back his truck up to his tow along camper. It makes it so much easier to hook up when you use the camera.
1,Will send it back,"This is the worst item I have purchased for my truck. The picture comes on very slow, the interferance gets so bad you can't see the picture on the monitor, the monitor flashes at night when the camera is not on. I contacted support and they ask me to test it in a remote area. So it works good in a remote area but 99% of the time it will be used in the city. The thing is worthless and I sent it back to the company."
1,Waste of money,"I purchased one of these cameras and it was junk. I installed it on a hot day, and before the day was over the camera was so fogged up you couldn't see anything on the screen. Mind you it just came out of the box and had not even been rained on yet and the inside lens of the camera was totally covered in condensation. customer service never got back to me from an email, and put you on hold until you finally give up (30 minutes twice). And they did get my email, a bot sent me a conformation of that."
3,"Ok, but just too unbelievable","I was real into this book during the first 1/3 but then as it becomes more and more unbelievable, I really lost interest. For me the improbably is acceptable, but this book just isn't realistic at all and for me that takes away a lot of the fun. I enjoyed The Coil by Gayle more than this..."
4,above-average chase book,"I enjoyed the book, although here and there i could have wished for a few fewer cliches; I think it is a little too much a book in which everyone who finds out anything is killed until near the end; the subject of the conspiracy itself is not novel; but the writing is fast-paced, and through the device of cellular memory the heroine is less of a wimpy damsel in distress than is usual in thrillers. On the whole, an enjoyable read."
2,Very Basic.,"This book is written for those with very little knowledge about yoga. It seems as if there is a disclaimer to contact your physician every other page.I'd highly recommend reading ""Yoga as Medicine"" by Timothy McCall M.D. Much better."
5,Ruffian Burning from the Start,"The book makes for excellent reading, in that it is the type of book, you do not want to put down!I thought it was well written and described, by Ms. Schwartz, and think a movie would be outstanding!Was recently advised that a movie in fact is being made by ABC, and ESPN for TV, which is coming out next June 2007."
3,It's OK - Other sources out there better,"Expensive magazine (over $3.00 per issue) geared to the new flier. Lots of advertising embedded in the articles. You would be better served by logging on to rcgroups.com or wattflier.com to get good solid articles and unbiased reviews from the people who bought and fly the planes. Oh yeah, the half dressed teeny-boppers on many of the covers - makes you wonder what time zone (60's perhaps) the editors live in!"
1,crappy cover,"This cover fell apart after 1 season. A small, brown $8 tarp secured with bungees worked -and lasted- better. The cover ripped and the seams gave out after filling with gunk by the 1 year mark."
2,Wait for the library copy,"Being an avid Coulter reader, especially of the bride series, I couldn't wait to get my hands on this book. I was disapointed to find that this book was not as good as the rest of the series. Coulter's usual edge of your seat plot lines are non existant and I found myself skipping through some parts just to find the real story. I love that she has created a historical soap opera with all her characters but in this case it cluttered the story. Lyon's Gate is a tale worth reading maybe buying if you collect the series but I won't be rereading this book anytime soon."
4,good,"Much better than some of her others. No rape scenes and less graphic details in the ""romance"" scenes. But, the ending didn't seem to have anything to do with the story."
2,She should just retire....,I've been a follower of Catherine Coulter for years and it's obvious to me that it's time for her to hang it up. The characters are cut from the same cloth as others in this series and the story is just as similar. Save your money.
5,Picture quality is perfect,I had read that the other release of this show had video quality issues and just wanted to state that this releases video quality is perfect.
5,New Kids!,"totally recommend Death comes to town!!saw the first two episodes on IFC and i cant stop watching them over and overMark Mckinney as ""Death: is consummate PerfectionENJOY!!"
5,Laughing over and over and over...,"I first saw this series on IFC and couldn't stop laughing! So creative and very clever, and the cast of characters are so totally convincing, even though they are played by the ""kids"" (guys, who play multiple characters). The comedy keeps coming at you in the most unexpected ways, and from all angles. You really never know what is going to happen next. I am so glad this is available for purchase - I can enjoy it over and over again!"
5,One Great Collection Of Man&Monsters,"When I first recived the book, the cover of it cought my eye, The monster on the front was mysterious to what i had normaly seen on the 1st and 2nd monster Manuals, and I was right-down interested about it, i flipped through the pages and saw many different, very descripive monsters, what there origin was, etc... and all most all of them had wonderful artwork to go with the monster. But of course this book is for experianced DM and Players alike, if you were to be starting out as a DM, then the older monster manual (1st) or the new book that has all 3 books combined, yet leaves out quite a bit of monsters, would also be very helpful to you. Remember though, as a DM there is never enough time to finish something, always have a backup module or something. -Berlo Silkshadows-"
5,Great Songs!,"Including one of the most beautiful songs of all times, Secret Love, this Cd is a must for people who enjoy good music. Lorrie does not have the voice of Ella Fitzgerald or Patsy Cline, but she delivers this one with an incredible taste for songs and performance. Just listen to the samples and you will understand what I am talking about. Much better than her other Cds, which include some with ""pop garbage"" country music. It is good to know that some artists still appreciate fine old music!"
1,Twangy Country Voice Doesn't Do These Songs Justice,"There is no doubt that she is a country music artist. It shows everytime she starts singing some of the great classics on this CD. Some of her music I like, but she should have left these songs alone. The music is great, but when she starts singing, she ruins it. A Julie London,""she ain't"" You might take the girl out of the country, but you can't take the country out of the girl. I didn't want to give it a one star rating, but that's as low as I could go. SAVE YOUR MONEY"
2,While I love the speed I get...,"EVERYTIME there is the first rumbling of thunder within a this modem stops working. I am now arranging for my fourth modem replaced until I get one more suitable. The speed for dialup is amazing, flipping pages is really good, videos and webcam not so go. I guess one gets what one pays for. It's a shame that these keep on failing on me, I had no problem with install and set up. Otherwise I'd be a fan."
1,Defective After Five Weeks,"I purchased this product and installed it. The Installation directions were lacking in detail, but a computer-savy person should have little problems. The modem worked fine for around five weeks, at which time I stopped receiving phone calls on my home phone line. I traced the problem to my computer modem. It was blocking all phone calls when the computer was on or off. After calling Trendnet Support, there was no answer for this problem. I tried switching phone lines, and went through all the diagnostics. It always came back as ""working properly."" To get the final satisfaction, I purchased another modem from a different company and guess what!! It works great and does not block any calls. I have only one conclusion---the Trendnet modem was defective."
1,Will not install with Windows 7,Sitting on my desk will not install even when I downloaded Windows 7 driver. Monitor turns off and only solution was to remove modem
2,Not worth while,"I expected more of this scope for paying 300 bucks. I have had two replacements already. First, it looses its zero every time I adjust the zoom, first and second scope. Second, there is a string/hair inside the optics tube that is directly in the line of the cross hairs. I would not recommend an AIM scope to anyone who wants to be able to hit what they are aiming at. Spend a couple extra bucks and buy a bushnell or something worth while that has a good reputation."
4,one of the best,Another great album from the classic Black Uhuru line up. Probably one of the best reggae albums of the 80's.
2,heavy-handed and unhistorical,"I agree completely with the ""heavy-handed"" assessment of another reviewer.This work is NOT a historical novel. It uses another time and place to write a rather overwrought story of religious intolerance that is somehow supposed to reflect on our times. Such a theme is universal. But readers interested in this novel's period of history would be more entertained and better served by reading David Underdown's ""Fire from Heaven"" about the ""godly reformation"" battles in 17th century Dorchester, England."
3,re: the first review listed above,This video does not include the original Styx line up. Tommy Shaw is not an original member. He joined the band in 1976 replacing John Curulewski.
4,"The Kilroy/Roboto Concept Was Corny, But Fun","I saw Styx in concert twice on the tour where ""Caught in the Act"" was filmed. The Kilroy mini-movie that is shown at the start of the video and the acting scenes between Dennis DeYoung and Tommy Shaw are just as bad as I remember them (no wonder Shaw left the band shortly thereafter - he did return in later years). However, the music is pretty good, although the presentation is a little lackluster. But I think that this video will bring back pleasant memories for Styx fans from their heyday of the late 70's and early 80's, especially if they saw the Kilroy tour. Overall, not a bad investment for the Styx fan, but if you had to choose, take the ""Return to Paradise"" video that is also for sale on Amazon."
3,good for intended audience,"This book is probably pretty useful for its intended audience- Orthodox Jews living in a homogenously Orthodox neighborhood. For people in that group, it is very accessible: it is written at about an eighth-grade level, and full of cultural allusions that make sense to that audience (references to kosher restaurants and various religious observances), and even suggestions that readers rebuke people who fail to follow religious rules. But precisely because of those allusions, the book may not be that useful to a broader readership."
1,"It would've been great, if I'd have gotten it.","I never got this particular item. I don't know if it got sent to the wrong address, (we were in the process of moving, so I still had my old adress on there,) or what, but I never got it. I'll have to order it again."
4,Very nice CD from Lionel.,"Like Gladys Knight, Lionel Richie has just released one of his better CD's. Richie in his heyday could do no wrong. However, the last several years have not been so kind. On Renaissance, Lionel gives us the CD, that we knew he was capable. This is classic Lionel, good songs, good production, and Lionel Richie's distinctive voice. If you were a Richie fan, then you will definitely want to pick up his latest."
1,not worth it,I bought this for the xbox for my son since it was his first game system. Well i was very dissapointed because i orderd two of them one didnt work at all and the other one only worked for like a month then didnt work at all.....These controllers are not worth the buy at all
4,Cute and a good part of the cottage.,These aren't made of anything too durable and you have to make sure your child doesn't try to climb into the toys. They are adorable and perfect for the cottage set.
1,THE TRACKER BY GARY PAUISEN,IN THE STORY TRACKER BY GARY PAULSENjOHN'S GRANDFATHER HAD TAKEN HIM HUNTING BUT JOHN DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO HUNT. SO HIS GRANDFATHER HAD TO TEACH HIM HOW TO DO IT. SO JOHN LEARNED HJOW TO HUNT. THE BOOK WENT INTO A LOT OF DETAILABOUT HUNTING. IREIIY ENJOYED THAT PART
2,Definately the worst book involving Tom Brown,"this book is the only one of Tom Brown's books that i read through but didn't completely enjoy. I think mainly because it is the story of Tom Brown Jr. as told to William Jon Watkins. I think Watkins tries to make it sound a little too poetic and loses a lot in his ""translations"" of Tom's stories. If you just want a good book about Tom Brown Jr., and not a field guide or a poor interpretation of his life, I would strongly recommend ""Case Files the Tracker."" it tells some of the same stories and many different, but i find it remarkably more interesting."
1,"great fiction, no not really","After hearing how he jumped on the back of the deer and slit it's throat, I called bulls***. That was the last time I picked up the book. What a waste."
4,Good for beginners in practice/good resource for veterans,"I had this book last semester as a MSW student at WVU. I have found it useful as a resource guide for my current practice as a family-based therapist as well. I would recommend this book to all those out there in practice.Deborah M. Migyanko, BSW"
1,Never got the book,"I ordered the book on 8.29.09, on 9.30.09 I received an email indicating that the book may have got lost in the mail. DO YOU THINK AFTER 5 WEEKS? I was under the impression that I should have received the book in 3- 5 business days. Not 5 weeks. I emailed the company several times in between and the company just brushed me off. Do not order anything from this company. I needed the book for class, as a result I had to go to the library to use the copy that was on reserve. The company displayed horrible customer service skills and waited until the bitter end to acknowledge their error."
3,Kinda Dry Text,"Great value for the money, but the text is def dry. I'm beginning to think all graduate school texts are though..."
2,wow this is a waste of money,"wow this is the exact same thing as the new blink cd. this has 1 bonus track but cost like 28 bucks more than the original 1 if u want the new blink cd dont get this version and spend 41$ get the 1 titled ""blink 182"". it saves a lot of maoney and it just has 1 less song that is on 1 of theyre older cds anyway.DONT GET IT SERIOUSLY"
1,"Don't bother, wait 'til the remainder bin",Not a great story or storytelling. Pick up a novel by David Lodge if you need a good read.
2,Really disappointed,"I guess I'm spoiled by the I Spy games I've purchased for my children. This game has an enormous amount of ""story""...it's almost as bad as sitting your child in front of the television. Interaction is confusing and frustrating. I'd rate this lower but it's clear that a lot of work went into the animation, which is top notch. I just wouldn't classify this as a learning game."
4,Williams-Sonoma Bread cookbook,Great recipes and I like the extra notes about baking. Already tried 3 of the recipes and can't wait to try more.
1,Not worth a sixpence,"Don't waste your money on this EP. (...) The only good song on it was Within a Room, Somewhere, which I already had on This Beautiful Mess. Healer and Dresses are alright but sound unfinished and too much like other Sixpence None the Richer songs. Love Letters in the Sand and Carry You are just plain obnoxious, and the two instrumentals are evan worse. Lastly, the techno version of Love, Salvation, The Fear of Death is the most disgusting piece of ""music"" I've ever heard. (...)"
4,Game advice,"It is very fun,and challenging in some spots.I like the music that plays in the game.I been playing it for almost 2 years."
1,No Shipping to Alaska?,It really sucks that Taget can't ship to Alaska. Do you think Alaska is a foreign country or something?
5,SHWEET!!!!,THIS IS THE BEST SUPER MARIO BROS. GAME TO DATE!! FINALLY LUIGI GETS A CHANCE TO SHINE! GREAT JOB NINTENDO!!!!!
5,Out of this world!!!!!!!!!!!,"Truly, this game is the best and greatest game eva made. I have played this game on two systems, the NES and SNES (part of the Super Mario All-Stars collection). I do have to say, i loved this game to death. One of the best Mario, no, one of the Best games eva made. The graphics are great, and the music was awesome. The gameplay, while normal, was awesome. While the storyline is classical and was the same as it's two predecessors, it was great. It was a pleasure for me to play this game."
4,Great Value and fit,I love the brand and the oversize pockets. These are a little heavier than the Tac Lite option but great in the Winter.
2,horrible fit in smaller sizes,"i'm a 29"" waist but i noticed that as the waist sizes go down, other dimensions stay the same. so if you're a skinny guy don't even consider getting there because you will look like a hood rat in baggy pants, which is in no way presentable in a professional setting and outright uncomfortable which can get in the way of any active operations.on the contrary, the materials and workmanship are superior, so if you're a waist size 38 and above go ahead and get these."
5,Great pants for all season around,"Nice comfortable and comes in various colors not to mention the new 3 colors: Tundra, Cayote and Sage. Chek them out!"
2,Had to return this item,"I have to return this item because itis the wrong size, wrong color, wrong style. Will be sending it back."
5,This is the book I'd been looking for,"This book is EXACTLY what I had been looking for. It's truly as it's title suggests - a blender babyfood cookbook. Great, simple recipes that look really yummy. This book is NOT like ""super baby foods"" which is a really great reference book and gives you all the ins and outs and whys of feeding your baby... but it offers lots of different options in a straightforward, concise easy to use cookbook. I reccomend it if you are truly looking for a babyfood cookbook. If you're looking for more educational reading, I would suggest ""Super Baby Food"" - that's a great one."
3,Somewhat confusing,"This book has a lot of great recipes but if you're looking for information on how to feed your baby when and how much, you won't find it here. Also, the recipes are broken down by age, for example, 6 months and older, which is confusing to me because some of these recipes have ingredients that I know a 6 month old can't eat yet. It would be better if the recipes where for babies 6-9 months or something like that."
2,Not too bad...,"It's got the standard blender recipes inside, written by a nutritionist. Look elsewhere for more information and more choices for your little ones."
5,love it!,"This is a wonderful book for parents wanting to make their own babyfood!! The recipes are ""kid tested"" and are very easy to follow. There is also a wide variety in foods to make which is helpful. The author also includes quick tips with the recipes. Plus, the book is slim making it less overwhelming and cumbersome to use."
5,"Outstanding, comprehensive resource book","A wonderful addition to any professional library. Leahy provides detailed descriptions and examples of a wide variety of cognitive interventions, complete with examples of the questions and statements that the therapist can use for each intervention, and sample therapist-client dialogues. The book contains many excellent ideas for cognitive restructuring in ways that are empathic and respectful of the client's feelings. There are also lots of sample worksheets that can be used for clients' homework. This book is great for therapists at any level who want new ideas for cognitive work."
2,horrid megaman ever!,"This game was just horrid! Worst Megaman ever! I started yawning during the beginning and middle of game. Why does Capcom even bother making an X8?? I didn't even finish the game. The game is very dull and not worth playing at all honestly. Capcom, you guys dissapoint me with this one and MVC3. Very dissapointing"
2,"slow pace, little action","This is the first Repairman Jack book I've ever read, but I'd heard many good things about them. It was pretty disappointing. The pace seemed very slow and the story never picks up; it just seems to trudge along to an unfulfilling ending. With a supernatural designer drug and a giant land shark, I'm amazed at how... boring... the story was. I'd like to think that maybe I need to read some of his other stories to enjoy this one more, but based on this book, it will be a while before I pick up another Repairman Jack novel."
1,How did this get published?,This is absolutely one of the worst books I have seen in a long time. It is unoriginal and formulaic. The writing is jerky with no flow or consistent rhythm. I would recommend against wasting your time.
4,Cute AND Awsome!!!!,Kirby's back--in an all new game! Cute and easy. I got a brown kirby and green kirby in Top Ride. I got white kirby in City Trial and in Air ride(and green).Purple too. What's Your favorite Legendary Air Ride Machine? Dragoon or Hydra? I like Dragoon.I even almost filled in the Checklist! U have to buy this!!!!
4,Very Dissappointing...<(v_v)>,"I was looking forward to this game, but it was a letdown. I played all the modes and id have to say City mode was the best because of all the unlockables.Good Thing:There are tons of things to unlock!Bad Thing:Once you unlock a star, most others are worse so it makes you not even use them (BIG BIG mistake).One thing that really bugs me is the control scheme. They arnt very hard to do, but you need to start turning before an actual turn for you to not hit something.The thing that bugs me most is the accesibility to everyone. A person playing for the 1st time can beat a vet who had it for months! Games shouldnt be like that. In order to win you should actually have to have some skill to beat people. I can see there wont be any tournaments for this. Why give prize money and glory to the winner when they could be lucky?"
4,One of the best gamecube games!!!,"This is an awesome game. The only problem is that one player is a chore. Having friends play with you is what makes it fun. Also, using one button to dive, boost, break, and use items is overdoing it a bit. The music also leaves much to be desired. The game is about 25% luck and 75% skill, which just makes it even more fun. This would be the perfect game for you if you have friends over a lot."
3,Pretty Good,This game is pretty fun but after you get Hydra and Dragoon it'sjust one of those games that you play it when you get bored anddon't have any thing to do. So I rated this game over all 3/5.
4,BUYING SOMETHING WORTH YOUR MONEY..,"The next big game in racing? you decide as your curving around hair pin turns racing all your favorite characters. racing so you can become number #1. Let's just say this game is fun. Racing, taking your enemy's power, then using it aganist them do i have to say more. unlocking bonus levels and being kirby IF YOUR A KIRBY FAN OR YOU JUST LIKE TO RACE GET THIS GAME...THE CHARACTER'S ARE FROM SUPER SMASH BROTHERS MELEE..."
4,This Game is Great!!!,"This game is good for people who have somebody else to play with. I like when you can get off your vehicle and look around the town on foot and change your vehicle (Only in the town). It's also cool that you can vs your mom, dad, brother, sister, or/and friends by using diferent abilities like throwing bombs, spitting fire balls, and more. Thats why I think this game is great!!!"
2,Boring,"This was another book required by my European Economic History class. While there is a ton of useful information in this book, it didn't feel like there were any original insights or theories. For anyone who knows a lot about the Industrial Revolution, this book is just a regurgitation of existing ideas."
1,Ill-founded Deductions,"To be useful a book on the creativity of societies and peoples which makes deductions based on what was invented, where and when, has to get the underlying facts approximately right. This book fails that test. For example it states that the water wheel was invented in the medieval period, clearly the author is not aware the famous Roman multiple water-wheel system in southern France so much visited by archaeological tourists. In the field of invention it is always to check the facts carefully as false claims are very often made. Thus many people still believe Edison's spurious claim to have invented the filament electric light despite the established fact that Swan preceded him."
4,"Good Game, but not enough in it...","I've had this game for a while and I admit it is FUN to play. The graphics are good, levels are interesting, and the characters a pretty cool too, but after playing the game a couple times it gets pretty boring. There aren't many levels to choose from or characters for that matter. There are only a couple different things you can do, and it does get pretty boring after a while, but I like it..It's a good game, but could use some sprucing up and a LOT more added to it would make it an AWESOME game."
5,Very useful for ESL classes.,"I bought this book for my Chinese student who could not speak or read English at all. The Chinese characters help her to remember the english words even though they do not have the pronunciation. In three months, she can start carrying a conversation in English with broken English. But at least she can communicate with us. The grouping by weather, color, daily routines etc. help me to concentrate on a subject and make teaching much easier."
2,NOT for people trying to learn Chinese,"I am trying to learn Chinese, and in seeing my toddler learn English by repeatedly looking at picturebooks, I thought a picture dictionary in Chinese would be a good way to learn every day objects in Chinese. Unfortunately, this book has the English word and the Chinese IN CHINESE CHARACTERS. NO pinyin, no bopomofo pronounciation. For the non-Chinese reader, you'll have to look up every single word. So, though this book may be good for Chinese students learning English, it is of limited usefulness to students learning Chinese. Frankly, I think this is an extremely stupid mistake by the publishers of this book. The editors should be flogged!"
3,Nice!,"Nintendo transformed the old Pokemon concept, and created a new world of amazing features that you couldnt belive!Pokemon Pinball Ruby and Sapphire makes a great boredom solution. A lot more advanced than the first one, you can catch over 200 Pokemon, and evolve them to add to your Pokedex.Unlike the first one, you can hatch Pokemon from eggs. You may also save up coins to shop for power-ups in the Poke Mart.This great game is a must have for any Poke fans out there!"
2,"An Insult to ""Smart Women""","I don't see how she can call this a guide for VBAC as it seems to be more of a guide for chosing elective repeat cesarean. There are many books available that paint a more thoughtful and complete picture of all the options available. I think this one is a waste of time and resources, unfortunately. I really disliked the perpetuation of cesarean as a ""safe"" choice when in reality, it is far more dangerous than VBAC and I disliked even more the perpetuation of the myths that support the obscenely high rate of surgical delivery in this country. Flamms book has more facts and he backs up his positions better, as does Wainer Cohen and Crawford and Walters.The only good points in this book are the stories from VBAC mothers. Those are a boost"
5,GREAT Family Series,We watched this when my kids were younger and even now they STILL enjoy the series! Great family entertainment and so glad that you made it available to us
1,Robin Hood Review,This game was not at all what I expected. Not fun and somewhat difficult to understand with poor graphics.
2,blast off,"My grandson was very excited when he opened his Birthday present, but after the second blast off it started leaking air around the red button you push for blast off. Very disappointed. I was going to return the set, but my grandson would not let go of the rockets. My son improvised and made him a 'blast off' anyway."
5,MxPx rocks,"This new Cd is such a great one! The lyrics and the sound, give the Cd a great vibe! You people need to get this one!! Your missing out if you dont have it!!!!!!!!"
2,Attempt at the Big Time,"I believe that for their entire body of work Mxpx are the best punk rock band ever. They have made three of the best punk albums I've ever heard with Life In General, Slowly Going The Way Of The Buffalo, and The Ever Passing Moment. This one I hate to say, seemed like they were just trying to hit the radio and MTV by abandoning their style with a very watered down version of themselves. I heard someone say ""it sounds like Mxpx operating at 40% of their potential just to reach a mainstream audience."" I believe that to be the simple honest truth. They wanted to sell out and hit big money with this one so they ended up making a record that sounded pretty fake and generic. It doesnt have the honest, raw emotion or edge of their earlier work. I wish they hadnt done it because even after Panic and Secret Weapon they still havent come back to what they used to be, I think this record was a mistake and they still haven't recovered from making it."
5,Way Awesome,If you dont have this cd GO OUT NOW AND AQUIRE IT! This is definatly the best cd of the year. Its had me listening to it day in and day out since i got it. Its way worth your money. If you dont have this cd your just... wrong.
4,Before Everything & After is awesum!,I think the new Mxpx cd is great! i think i is way different from sum of their previous cds...their sound is still rawkin!
5,Finally something New From These Guys!,"I've been waiting three years for this CD. MxPx was the first punk band I ever got into and I absolutely love them as much as I did when I first heard them. Anyway, what can I say that's good about this CD that hasn't already been said yet? It's complex, mature, and real. The songs are mostly about life on the road and missing your true love, and some are about friends. I really like it. MxPx started growing up, you could say, after each member got married in the past year. I really like this CD because I'm an adult now, and I'm starting to grow out of the typical pop-punk songs; I'm ready for something more mature. This CD gives the listener all of that and more."
5,hey hey hey hey,"yah, i was like yah mom, take me to the store to buy a cd. and she said okay, so i bought this cd, it stinks so bad that i listened to it for about 555555555 million times in a row. So i would like say no to smoking."
4,A Different Sound,"I picked this CD up and didn't really know what to expect. I heard their ""Play It Loud"" single on that MTV Made-For-TV movie so I was afraid of the CD sounding too much like ""The Ever Passing Moment."" Luckily, the CD turned out better than I expected. The sound is mainly mainstream ""pop punk."" But it's fun and MxPx are a great band overall. I have been a MxPx fan for about six years now and this CD is not my personal favorite (""Life in General"" is my fave) but not to be passed up."
3,????????,I heard MxPx on Teenage Politics (my friend had the CD) and i was glad to see that pop-punk hasent been completely distroyed by GC and NFG. But this CD is a real disapiontment. I was hoping for somthing more along the lines of Green Day/Blink 182.Theve turned into Good Charlottes twin borther. Now they sound like a mixure of GC simple plan and yellowcard. I should have gotten Life in Gerneral instead. This Cd is just to cheesey. No ofessed to who ever said it but i think i am gonna go listen to my rancid and nofx stuff
5,Rokin!!!!!!!!,"This CD ROCKS, period! Everyone who says the new stuff sucks is crazy!! On Play it Loud they say ""We like the songs we play we LOVE THIS sound!"" So this is MXPX you dont like I dont care, go listen to your Rancid, NOFX Junk!"
2,One of the Worst MXPX Albums,"As an avid MXPX fan (I've been there from Pokinatcha and have every album since), I could not like this album, no matter how hard I tried. It's manufactured power-pop, no edge, nothing original, and not even close to anything near MXPX's true potential. It's clear that Mike & gang were really struggling lyric-wise, because the songs are the same rehashed lyrics. While they have very few catchy melodies and guitar progressions, this album is worth passing by."
1,not all that great,"having just come back from the down-under, I was excited to find a collection of native music here in the US because CDs cost about twice as much down there. This has some nice songs on it, but was very sporadic and the performances mostly weak. I was dissapointed."
1,Not up to par with current games,"I was unaware that Gameboy Advance does not have as neat and updated graphics as the newer video games. This was a gift for my husband for his Nintendo DS, and he wasn't too thrilled about the video game. I thought this game was the same as the old DS Mario Golf game, but it is not. It's a shame I spent over $30 for this game that my husband only played a couple of times. I would not recommend this game."
5,As good as Golf on the go can get.,"10.0 PresentationAbsolutely brilliant and thorough golfing experience that goes well beyond the console experience. The RPG element adds depth to an already great golfing design.9.0 GraphicsIf you liked the Golden Sun style, you'll love the look of Mario Golf. The 3D view's a little awkward, but after a few minutes you won't even notice the strange Mode 7 skewing.9.0 SoundFantastic audio and soundtrack throughout the experience, though some tune selections don't exactly fit the golf action.10.0 GameplayCamelot really knows its golf. GameCube Mario Golf was great, but the GBA version blows it away in features and depth.10.0 Lasting AppealSingle player, multiplayer, tournaments, RPG level-up, GameCube connectivity, Wireless network support. Did I miss anything?"
1,Really confused about version available...,"I'm interested in picking this album up but the only in-print version is the expensive import from 2003. I ordered it but then had second thoughts and cancelled it because of the cost - the MP3 version is much cheaper.Here's my question: is this import version expanded or does it only contain the 11 songs listed under the Amazon description? Amazon can be confusing because they often neglect to list additional material when they combine all previous versions of a release under the product description. If it's expanded then I'm more willing to purchase the CD... if not, I'll probably just buy the cheaper MP3 download.May seem silly to some folks, but I still prefer physical copies of my music over digital downloads. In this case, however, the price differential has tempted me to ignore that bias.Thanks!"
5,Pleased customer,The product was better than what I expected! The price was well below compared prices for similiar items in the store! I would not hesitate to purchase again from seller!
1,this is crap,"bought this product at a retail store to use on my boots and hat. Completely soaked my boots and hat with this stuff, used a whole can. It took 4 days to dry and still my feet would get wet in just a few minutes of just walking through wet grass, and my hat, forget it. It shedded water better without it. The water would bead before this stuff, and after I used it, the water would actually SOAK IN!"
4,Silicone water-proofing,"Very good product. Reasonably priced,fast delivery. Easy to apply.Recommend outdoor application due to overspray and dripping."
3,Color Looked Great At First But Turned To Blue,"Call me silly, but I had decided long ago I did not like drinking uncolored water and took to using liquid food coloring kits so I could drink purple, green, orange or even turquoise water. I decided mixing red and blue was tedious so I searched Amazon for purple food coloring and found this product. It did work great when I first colored the water in my glass that gave it a definite purple color. Unfortunately, as I sipped it, the water turned blue which is not what I would have expected. Since I only needed to put five drops into the glass, it will take a long time to use up but when I do I will go back to the red and blue bottles in food coloring kits. At least when I use those, the water stays purple to the last drop."
4,One of my favourite cookery books!,"It is a tradition in my dad's family that every bride receives a copy of this cookbook. It is one of the best for good, stick-to-your-ribs, downhome cooking. There are NO light,low fat recipes here, but you can adjust the fat and sodium in the recipes. The Devilsfood chocolate cake recipe is my all-time favorite, and the Maraschino Cherry Cake is a good one, too. Try the 7-minute Icing on it! Can't say enough about it!!"
5,brilliant,"highly recommended for anyone looking for the best of the worst. if you give this film one star its because you dont get the joke. of course its not effective in its attempts! but once you get past that, deep within lies a cinematic classic that will stay with you for the rest of your life. JOIN US!"
3,Just Try It!,"I love this Black Uhuru line-up - Michael's distinctive lead with Puma and Duckie's sizzling background vocals are pure magic. 7 great songs on this CD, with Party Next Door being my only throw away, make this a must have for Black Uhuru fans. Let me not forget that Sly and Robbie are on this joint, too!"
5,Best game ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Fire Emblem was awesome! My friend got it, and I always wanted to play it since I liked it so much. Now, I'm on level 28, and I have a hero. The storyline is great,and the battle scenes are way cool! There is always a different mission, and noone you previously fight ever comes back, so you are always fighting new characters(except Vaida the wyvern lord, who you fight on lvl 24 and 27). The theme is good,and you are using Lyn, Eliwood, or if you beat the game once, Hector as your main lord. I give this game a complete 5 stars."
1,EWWWWWWWW,"I hate this game. Not because its stratagy but because its completey boring. I like final fantasy, KOTOR ect. but this is just soooooooo bad I hate it. All you do is move your little person around on a map and then watch them fight eachother...WATCH...THATS IT!! You have NO control over who wins or loses at all there is no attack button or menu you are just watching and if your person loses there gone...FOREVER. This is the worst game I have ever bought if you want a fun RPG go buy Final Fantasy I & II there much better. Although In the 2nd one you cant switch people in the line so thats a little odd. I like 1 better. Please unless you like crappy games do NOT buy this heck dont even take it for free. ITS THAT BAD!!"
4,Fun but ...,"Your experience with this game all depends on how well balanced your character level up. If you make the mistake I did (leveling 1 character to the maximum) near the start of the game, you may be in for some serious difficulty later in the game.Also unfortunate is the lack of a true game save option. You have 3 save slots but can only save your progress on a particular level once. If you want to continue from a key point in a level (for example, before a character of yours dies) you can't! You have to restart the whole level. I must have played Chapter 26x at least 20 times already. Once a character dies, they remain that way unless you restart the level. It's so hard to let a leveled up character die towards the end of the game... the solution? Keep playing the level over and over again. Ugh."
3,not working on newercars,Newercars have safety mechanisms on board to prevent usage of this kind of hoses.Therefore i was never able to use it (so far). I didnt send it back because it wasnt expensive and sooner or later I will need it.If there will be problems i will update further. The 3 stars are for not warning people that you can not use it on YOUR new car.
5,Great product,If you own a boat this is the best for fuel dispensing. Very fast flow. This is a great item to have for fuel filling.
4,Fascinating Device; doesn't work for gasoline siphon,"In a bucket, or a hot tub, or something open this thing works great. Just shake away and suddenly the fluid starts flowing.My disappointment is that this came up when I searched for ""gas siphon"". Our intent was to use the RV's fuel tank to siphon out fuel for our generators rather than haul separate gas tanks. This doesn't work for that; the fitting on the end is too large to fit through the curves in the gas filler tube. I'm going to keep it just because it's neat and wasn't very expensive."
1,Feeble shaker siphon,"The Hopkins FloTool 10801 shaker siphon that I purchased via Amazon did not do what I expected and wanted.Shaking its tip vigorously up and down while well immersed in gasoline did draw a small amount of gas up six inches and into the siphon tube, but not enough to fill the plastic tubing, and therefore not enough to start siphoning. I think that the apparatus might work better if the tube were thinner, and therefore easier to fill.The principle of this ball-valve apparatus is good, and the tube does keep one's fingers out of gasoline, but overall this is not an adequate product."
1,This book is a hoax but the issue is real,"This book is now considered a hoax. You can do an internet search to comfirm this but here's one: www.guardian.co.uk/international/story/0,3604,1268957,00.htmlI was suspicious of the book when I saw her on Cspan. I lived and worked as a journalist in Jordan and knew her discussion of the number of honor kills was too high by a factor of 10-100 times (she claims thousands per year in a country the size of New Jersey, the actual number is at most two dozen per year). But now the brave Jordanian journalist, Rana Husseini, who actually did risk her life to bring this issue to the fore in Jordan has come out definitively against the book's veracity. Does Amazon have a responsibility to make note of this? I think the booksellers at least should caution on the book description that it is now widely considered to be a fake. The author grew up in Chicago, not Jordan, and this particular case of honor killing does not exist in the record books according to Husseini."
1,Honor Lost is a lie,"According to the 1 Aug 2004 Chicago Tribune, this book is an out and out lie, totally fabricated by the author. See www.chicagotribune.com for more details. Registration is required, but the site is worth it."
4,Do not buy!,"The servers have been taken down by the money grubbing cronies at EA, so it is now useless. Save your money!"
3,"Great graphics, boring game.","This game works well on my nvidia fx5200.It looks even better than the previous versions.However, the game suffers from the same effect as the movie ""The Polar Express"" when you compare it to ""The Incredibles"". You simply don't care if the golfers look more like real people.I prefer the 2003 version of this game where you had to play silly golfers like ""The Don"" and ""Tsunami"" and a guy in a kilt to win the Tiger Challenge. The Tiger Challenge is gone, which used to be the best part of the game.In short, fun and fantasy was replaced by boring simulation."
4,Good,"This is a good album. Not great but not mediocre either. Sometimes I get sick of it and I think its the vocals that get under my skin. But overall its a feel good album. And dare I mention how ridiculously catchy that ""Young Folks"" tune is. Oh boy. Its a get stuck in your head all day song."
2,Basic Indie music,"Peter, Bjorn and John cover no new ground with this album. That is not to say that it is not a bad CD, but the fact is there have been artists in the same territory before, and without a doubt many will follow in the footsteps of Peter, Bjorn and John.It is a fun record to listen to on the edge of pop and indie, which makes it very accessible for the greatest amount of consumers. The track ""Young Folks"" is the best song, and was also released as a single. It is a fun song and it is a nice song to relax to, but the rest of the album is rather lacking in depth and execution.Overall, I would say download the track ""Young Folks"" and skip the rest of the album."
2,Jay Leno,"These two, whom I've never heard before last night, kind of took me back for a moment. I thought I was listening to a new revived Figurine album which is greatly anticipated from that dynamic trio.I liked the sound, and although faintly mumbled by the poorest sound engineer in Cali. I was able to get a feel for what this Swedish pop group can do. I suggest, if I may, making it yourself.If you feel the music, live by it, you know they will come to hear it. This group tends to remind me of the smae hope."
5,"Not Just ""Pin-Ups""...","I decided to add this to my ""Pin- Up Book"" collection when the price fell below $$$!Although I really had no idea what to expect, imagine my surprise (and astonishment!), when I discovered that this book is not only a great ""Pin-Up"" resource, but also a fantastic ""Nose Art"" book (in it's own right!).Not only does it cover the B-24 Liberator (in abundance), but also includes the B-17, B-25, B-26 and B-29 (bombers), and features fighter aircraft as well! Tons of color photos, never before published.As an added bonus, I didn't realize this was a huge ""Coffee Table"" book! (13.35 x 10.32 in.) with 144 pages of visual delight!"
1,Man this (is bad),really really disappointed with the game play and graphics blocky and un attractive charaters ...
5,best gba game,I have olmos all of the gameboy advance games and most fothem are good lick goldensun and goldensun lost age thay are as good as ffta.
2,"boring, waste of time","I don't get why everyone is going bonkers for this game. I played for a few hours and was bored out of my mind. You spend half of the time just sitting there watching the AI monsters move around. Couldn't they speed it up a little? Move here, click Fight, fight that guy, fight that guy, ok wait wait wait wait wait wait, ok fight fight...done. Lather, rinse, repeat. Wow, fun.And can somebody explain to me why I get to CHOOSE where towns are put on the map? That's just weird and is not explained at all.The graphics are pretty nice, but that's about all I can say. I don't care how 'deep' the character system is, this game is boring."
1,JUST PLAIN BAD,"THIS GAME HAS ONE GOOD FEATURE AND IT IS THE GRAPHICS. BUT OVERALL THIS GAME IS BAD. ALL YOU DO IS FIGHT AND NOTHIN ELSE. PLUS THE FIGHTS TAKE LIKE 20 MINUTES EACH, THAT IS WAY TO LONG."
4,a good idea,"I really never had played the old version of FF:TA and I was thought that Square had done a good job on this game.The graphes would get a 8/10 nothing great, but not bad.The story would get a 9.5/10 incredible story, but confusing at first. That may just be make the play as confused as Marche is in the beginning.The game play would get a 9/10 quite a few good ideas for the R.P.G. world.The overall is exacly 8.8333333___ divided by 2 is 4.41 which rounds to 4/5 a good game borrow it first to see if you like it if you do...BUY IT."
4,Ohh My God,Man this game is so tight but so damn hard. U have to be an long time gamer and an excelent gamer. You have 300 missions and they are all harder than the next. This is a great game and it is hard. try it if u are an advanced gamer!!!!!!!!!
4,ehhhhhhh.....,"final fantasy. always with the crystals. geez. you have are Marche. some kid in a little town that you moved too. you go to a school meet some friends, one of em finds a book, makes a wish, a BOOM! you're in another world. there you fight demons and uncover secrets of soom world. and destroy crystals to get back to your own world. that's it. but it's fun and has a good story line and fighting system is the same as final fantasy tactics for PS. so get it. it's a good game. and become an assassin or a ninja. they're fun."

1,"appallingly, pointlessly unpleasant","Ok, technically there is a point, but it's really, really not worth it. Led on by my great enjoyment of the complex and imaginative milieux in _A Million Open Doors_ and _Earth Made of Glass_, I plowed all the way through this repetitively violent book, hoping that the main character would turn sympathetic at some point. No dice. The ending shows some intellectual ingenuity, but nowhere near that of _Doors_ or _Glass_, or even _Orbital Resonance_. A must-miss."
4,bought for a class,"See my review of ""Reference and Information services in the 21th century"" since my observation and suggestion for the publisher is the same."
2,OK but ...,"...the Organic Chocolate Chip Pecan Shortbread 2-Count Cookies (Pack of 12) were within 60 days of their expiration date upon arrival. They were tasty but crumbles, too many crumbs, NOT the nicely formed cookies depicted. I wouldn't buy theses again UNLESS I knew the expiration date was further out. Hopefully they would have an improved taste and form.So my first try with wheat and gluten free cookies was ""just OK"" :-s"
1,Strange market and strange marketing,"Wait a minute: how could one of the reviewers below know that this album would be ""nominated for a Grammy in a few days""??? I was schocked to read it, and even more shocked when I read that the album had been one of the five CDs nominated for the next Grammy Awards in the Jazz Vocal Album category. This category includes both female and male singers, plus vocal groups. So, my conclusion is very simple. There is really a very strong marketing behind Ms. Luciana Souza. And the development of her career is very very strange... Last but not least: dozens of great singers recorded excellent albums in 2003 (Chris Connor, Helen Merrill, Mark Murphy, Manhattan Transfer, Laurie Wheeler) but none of them received any Grammy nominations. But Ms. Souza did. Oh, what a shame!"
5,Great book for the Gnomish Folk,I have this book and it has helped me a lot with making my Paul Con-Con Gnome chararcter. It gives you all the facts about gnomes and halflings whether you be a stalker like me or a tunnel rat halfling like my brother this is the book you'll want!
4,smiley was good,"boy her tape was good my favorite is the song about weed with the rick james sample from bustin out plus I liked the song pushin on where she samples the commodores easy I also dig smiley but not friendly which uses evelyn champagne's classic disco joint shame lyrics by smilety also features love rollercoaster 92 was a good year for me miss those days too bad smiley, and dmw was a midwest secret."
1,"It may not lose suction, but doesn't have much to begin with.","I inherited this dyson when my girlfriend moved in. I unfortunately gave my old Eureka to the friend who helped us move. The thing has very little suction. I have to make multiple passes, so takes me more than twice as long to vacuum than it did with my old cleaner. The head is so large it wont fit under chairs and coffee tables that other machines can do with ease. The whole wand assembly is clumsy and hard to use (though I will admit that it is nice to have all the hose stowed in the machine itself).It it completely made of flimsy plastic and I am constantly worried that I am going to crack something. This is not acceptable construction for a $400 machine.Clever marketing and hype are what sells this machine, not side by side comparison with competition. This is clearly the worst vacuum Ive owned (including a dirt devil)."
5,"Great vacuum, but shop around...","My unit arrived yesterday, and I tried it the minute I got home. It works great as advertised, but also has it's drawbacks as others described (weight, hose, etc).There are plenty of good deals online... I went down the list of the authorized resellers on Dyson's website, and quickly found some very competitive ones. A little skeptical at first, I finally decided to give it a shot and bought it from a site that offers 30 day return policy."
1,Cheap plastic parts break,"Expensive for breakable plastic. It does pick up dust - until it finds hair, then it jams, and if you don't pull the plug and fix it on time, heats up and the brush melts (about 2-4 seconds, so it's a real problem). Ours only lasted 5 months, and the warranty's only good for selected locations, which is not real convenient."
2,"We get it, you are brilliant","The application part of the text was very useful. If you are new to learning theories, this book is probably not the best choice. No doubt, Gredler is a brilliant person; however, the writing is too complex and overly complicated. I think my comprehension level is on par with my peer grad students, but this book got on my nerves. I had to google a lot of the theories to read in plain English before I could read this book. I am selling it back!"
3,Works,"These are cheap controllers that work. However, beware that they are cheap controllers and mine has already started to fall apart."
4,I'm now a huge fan so I have to own everything.,"1. Staring at the Sun - I can hear no difference between this and the album version. It's a nice song though.2. Crash - Different arrangement. Most of UVS songs are realized using guitars. Ralske is probably good at keyboards and like most musicians uses keyboards to figure out his songs so this is a different aural viewpoint.3. Three Stars - Very Different arrangement. Again there are more keyboards, Piano, on this which allows an interesting new listening.My copy was so absurdly cheap it's worth it just for this song.4. Something Better - not on any of the albums if I'm not mistaken. Uncharacteristic ballad sounding like it was written in between the mercy scene in Great Britain and the following psychedelic scene."
2,It was a misleading Photo of the product,i received the wrong kind of converter. I thought from the photos that it is a converter from the old style IDE power cable to the new style SATA power cable. what i had was just a simple extension of SATA power cable which extended my existing SATA power to ONE more available cable
4,Worrks,Not much that I can say. Simple converter. Does what its supposed to do. I didn't give a five of five because it was pretty short.
5,Great way to add more SATA drives!,Just use one of your old 4 pin connectors and add 2 new SATA connections. Works easily
1,Slow to confirm,Over a month since placing this order and I have yet to receive an issue or an confirmation of my subscription.
4,GREAT!!!! FANTASTICO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Greetings kind folks, spendid game if I do say so myself. Buy this phenomenon and you will be pleased.Sincerely,Thank you.P.S. I do not enjoy my sister."
4,Not a bad game over all,"Pokemon fans would love this game. It's a lot like pokemon XD: Gale of darkness in terms of the graphics and the fact that the story is centered in the ore region, but there are some major differences. For instance, your character is no longer a young boy who is the son of the director of the Pokemon lab but an ex-team snagem member. You still go around the ore region snaging shadow pokemon and purifiying them, but it takes a little longer since you don't have the purifying chamber. There are couple of down sides to this game though, you can't save anywhere you want, you have to use the P.C. system to do that which can be anoying at certian points in game play. The only other down side is that it's not always clear what to do next in the game. I would reccomend getting a game guide to help you through out the game. Over all though this is a fun game and is worth buying."
3,Because I had to catch them all...,"Pokemon has been a staple in video gaming now for more than a decade. I just recently got into it and was hooked from the first one on. I got swept up and just well... had to catch them all. The only way to catch certain pokemon was to play through this game and Pokemon XD. Was it worth it? Yes and no. The actual gameplay is kinda mediocre as is the plot and dialogue, although it's neat to see your pokemon rendered in 3D performing their attacks. Also, the prize for doing everything in this game that can be done is the acquisition of your very own HO-OH (a rare and powerful pokemon that you can't get through normal gamplay). It was okay, but I wouldn't play it again.Would I recommend this? If you want to get every pokemon then yes. However with HeartGold and SoulSilver coming next year with all of the Johto Region pokemon (HO-OH and Lugia also) the recommendation is harder to make. It's also not the easiest thing. This game makes you earn it."
4,Why has the Pokemon company forsaken us!!,"Let me start off by saying Pokemon is way cool. I'm not trying to diss the creators but...THIS GAME FEELS INCOMPLETE!!! In the Stadium games you could rent pokemon,they make noises(such as PIKA-CHUUUUUUU), the announcer talks, and the game was fast moving. Now Colosseum on the other hand is a great game but it's the complete opposite of everything I said about stadium. Plus you can ONLY play multiplayer with a Gameboy Advance(SP). You need a Gameboy Advance,Ruby or Sapphire, and the link cable.(...). I heard a rumor of Pokemon Colosseum 2! let's hope it includes some features from Pokemon Stadium 2!"
4,The Best Pokemon Game Ever !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Pokemon Colosseum is the greatest Game I've played! I have played most of the other pokemon RPG games, and I can't get enough of this one. The graphics are the best I've ever seen! You also get to see Clebi once or twice in this game! EVERYTHING is in 3D! The only downside is that you can't catch wild pokemon in Orre (Just Shadow Pokemon)."
4,Pokemon Colosseum,"Hey, This game has great 3D effacts, great graphes and reallllycool pokeman and characters........ and i think it was cool howwe could play game boy games on the T.V with that game since ihave pokemon blue,silver,yellow, and crystal.... i think i couldbet all the levels... and the bonus levels......"
4,Great game,This is a great game and pokemon fans probaly love this game but it is very odd in many different ways. This game does not have pokemon that you an chose from the game. Sometimes the music can get very annoying and boring. This is also alittle to much like the gameboy games and dosen't work on this game. Other than that it is a great game and I would definitly reccomend this to anbody who like pokemon.
2,Not Pokemon Again,This game is not a game that i would play it's just like all the others you beat it then there is nothing else to do it's the same thing walk around beat people in battles the only thing that's diffrent is it's in 3-D which do not get this game i got it and beat it in like 1 week
2,expecting a Pokemon Stadium 3,"The game itself is good, if you were expecting another RPG, but for those of us who wanted a Pokemon Stadium compatible with Ruby and Saphire, it is no good. The only stadium thing this game has is a battle mode; nothing else."
1,"DUMB, STUPID, !@#$@!)&","NINTENDO'S SADDEST ATTEMPT TO BRING A REVOLUTION TO THE GC IS RIGHT HERE. DUMB, STUPID, U NAME IT. MY RATING: DOESN'T DESERVE ANY STARS. I WISH IT WERE LIKE THE GOOD OL' RPG DAYS. IF THEY COULD PUT THOSE GRAPHICS IN TO KANTO, KOGA, ECT., I MIGHT GIVE IT 3 STARS."
1,this game SUCKS,do not buy this game please do not waste your money own this when i played this game i was mad it sucks i got something and threw it at this game please dont waste your money on this game pleas do NOT
4,Please! Please! DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!ur rippin ur selvs off,Oh yea Pokemon Colleseum looks like the best game people made BUT!!! Ur not goin 2 beleive how much this game stinks. Yea sure good graphics but it really is dissapointing because.1 Ur character looks like he just came out of a teletubie graveyard..2 There is so little u can du..3 That girl looks like she goes around havin a crush on u.4 Any1 wud raher play Pokemon ChannelPlease rent it if u wunt 2 try it but don't buy it
3,Pretty good,"It wasn't as good as expected because there isn't that many locations, battles get repetitive and the only way to catch Pokemon is in battles and the Pokemon have to be 'shadow' types.Nevertheless it's still a pretty good game.Graphics:7.5/10Gameplay:7/10Lifespan:7.25/10Overall:70% - 74%"
5,Pokemon Colosseum Rocks!!! [part 2]:-),"Hello, again. :-) Um.....sorry i didn't tell you this a long time ago, right after i wrote my review about Pokemon Colosseum. Okay, here's the point i forgot to tell: the reason why the character you're playing is a ""Pokebandit"" because in the story mode you are the (one and) only Pokemon Trainer who snags Pokemon--but your ""snagging"" is for good reason- to save Pokemon from the evil organization. Well, newbies might like this game because of the 3d animations of this game(that's one reason). While the vets, ummm.... maybe it's because of the new story mode(that's one reason). Maybe that's all i can tell about now. Well just what I've said before: If you wanna know more you've gotta play this game. :-)"
3,Pokemon,"My review is going too be short and to-the-point.PROS:-Good Graphics-Nice controls-Lots of hidden Items-Its a Pokemon game!CONS:-Unfair Enemys. The computer always have a huge advantage over you. For example, in one battle they crushed my with FIVE CONSECUITVE horn drill attacks (which is an automatic ko that normally has about 30% accuracy) and EVERY SINGLE ATTACK of mine missed.-Bad enemy design. The enemys (the admins at least) are clad in HORRID eyesores. for example, Nasoucr, or whatever his name is in a purple spandex bodysuit, red skirt, white spikey hair, and pointed blue shoes.-I feel like Im playing a beta version. It feels like this game is off a demo disk.-No wild pokemon. Enough said."
2,NOT! What I Expected,"I was expecting Pokemon stadium 3. But this is not it. What it really is, is just a new edition of the Gameboy series.I've been a Pokemon fan since Red and Blue versions, (the first two games of the gameboy series) Liking it all. But ever since the beginning it has been winding down.Now with the new Pokemon Colosseum, it took a jump... Down. There's some major problems with this game like, where's the plot? How come you can't go in-between towns? Why so little Pokemon? Why do the bad guys look mutated? Well I can tell you this I was very disappointed at this almost a Pokemon game"
2,Ok but obvious features lacking,"This game is less fun than Pokemon Stadium 2. What happened to the commentary during battles. While the graphics are generally ok, they are some pokemon that have not been rendered very well at all. Transfering pokemon between this game and the gameboy games is not easy at all. And finally the Pokemon are so soundless (as is the whole game) you might fall asleep trying to stay interested in it. As with all Pokemon games the insane level/exp points requires long hours in annoying battles to get anywhere. Will they ever create a nice Pokemon game?"
3,Difficult,"I really liked the story mode where you could walk around and challenge other trainers because it's like the Game Boy games. That was one of the only good parts. One problem I had with it was the gym leader you first challenge. He is way to difficult considering the pokemon you first aquire. It took me about 15 tries to beat it each taking an extremly long time. I have played some of the origanial games including Silver version, Sapphire version,and the two 64 games but I found this game particularly annoying. The graphics and storyline were good but not excellent. Now to the battle mode. The problem I have with this is you have to have a gameboy and a gamecube gameboy cable. Also if you have lots of other games on your memorycard chances are you'll need another one because it takes 48 blocks. Considering the price of the game and other things you need it's a bit of a rip off. I might be a bit harsh saying it's a rip off because it's an ok game but it has some flaws."
5,It's one to pass around,I loved it. It got read and passed around at my job and when it got to me I had to get a copy of my own. It was a very cozy read on a quiet graveyard shift. I look forward to more by Michelle McGriff.
3,Kept me reading,This was probably a 3 1/2. It was very well written. Hard subject matter. Books on serial killers are not usually my kind of book. I did enjoy it.
5,Can't believe they don't make these anymore! (or do they?),"Arguably one of the coolest things that Klutz ever did (and that's going some!) I've even stuck a little magnetic whiteboard with some rare-earth magnets in with mine so that I can use it as a ""travel edition"". 15 games in one, and all cool ones. (Although one or two of them could use a few more words of explanation/rules clarification.) Very compact and convenient: keeps all the boards, rules and playing pieces together without hassle.In a word: Awesome!"
3,Just does its job,"This is a great clock but I'm sure there are better ones on the market.Great Screen, I could clearly read everything on it. Also the screen lits up when you press a single button.The part I did not like is that you have to make sure the adapter is plugged in for the projection to work. The quality of the projection is not that great."
5,Good book for moderate readers.,A wonderful book for moderate readers. Great for all ages. It explains how early sailors believed the Atlantic Ocean was cursed.A very exciting book!
4,Gift for a Friend,He loves it! Also gave him the bobblehead Cthulhu. He collects this kinda stuff. Received very quickly and in good shape.
5,Amazing book!,This is a very insightful book. It is very informative and helpful!! Very easy to read and follow. I highly recommend!
5,Be a better father,"This was the most creative book on the presidents I have ever read. Just seeing their lives through the eyes of the children changes everything. But mostly I was motivated to be a better father. It is incredible to read about Lincoln, Roosevelt, Jefferson, Adams as fathers. It seems that life demanded so much that something had to give and that something was all to often the kids. Made me rethink my own role."
5,All the Presidents Children is a Great Insight,"All the Presidents Children takes you on a journey into an area of Presidential access that you would never have the opportunity to experience unless you lived next door to the White House. I found the book to be a great read, and as well, it provided me a better understanding of things Presidential. This is one book you will want to keep on your shelf, for others to enjoy, and to serve as a historical reference for time to come."
4,"Some good information and a long, long list","I was researching for something I was writing and this book gave a lot of wonderful information. It categorized a bit but could have done more. While the categories themselves, helps the reader see many different patterns in the children of the oval office, the categories themselves seemed a little random."
2,lackluster,"I've had this product for over a year now and noticed from the outset that something was missing. Being a bit of an audiophile (but not expecting such from pc speakers, subwoofer or not), lackluster is pretty accurate for these speakers. My five year old Harmon Kardon's (still kickin'), that came with my first Dell have more depth than these things. If you're into sound at all, be warned, the sound from these speakers is murky, muddy and flat with no depth or soundstage, yuk! Bass? I think not, at least that's not what I'd call it. It's not even distinguishable to define it. The Labtec 1070'sLabtec LCS-1070 Spin 70 2-Piece Computer Speakersare a better bargain particularly as they are older and you'll probably find them for cheap, I did, just bought a pair from Amazaon. They aren't the ""best"" but I could at least classify them as a speaker, unlike the creative's, which I'm chucking when my Lab's arrive. $40, no frelling way."
1,"First the tone went, then the right speaker","I use my speakers on rare occasions. I listen to light music, and I never set the volume above the halfway mark. I also keep the setting at about 25-50% on my computer. So, after a few weeks, I was very surprised that I started receiving problems with this speaker set.At first, the tone adjustment started having problems. When I turned the knob a little past the half way point, the speaker started to make a loud even tone. It would not stop until I turned the speaker off, and back on again. Finally, I set the tone back to the center and stopped messing with it.A few months later the right speaker just stopped working. This is the main power speaker, so I know it's plugged in properly, and receiving power (the light is on, and the left speaker plays fine).I would not recommend this product to anyone, and this experience will make me think twice about purchasing another Creative Labs product."
1,Run. Don't buy.,"The Creative Labs I-Trigue 2200 2.0 Speakers are fine, just like the free cell phones you get when you sign up with a cell company are fine. So, if some one is giving you a pair, they come free with some promotion, or if you can get them for the cost of shipping, then go ahead. Don't pay money for them. Anybody under 75, who likes even a little bit of volume with their music, should avoid these speakers. They are tinny and can't handle their own wattage. They are also ultra small compared to what is perceived in the marketing photo. If you are looking for something for your laptop, maybe I would recommend parting with 10.00 for them. For anybody who likes a return on their money, almost any other brand will do you better for the 50.00 dollars or so they are being sold for. Creative Labs is a hype name. Cheaply built and sub-average quality with a fancy sounding name. I've learned my lesson."
1,BROKE AFTER 2 DAYS!!! SECOND SET BROKE AFTER 1 WEEK!,"I am going to start avoiding Chinese-made products now. They don't work, break, have inferior fit and finish or pose a safety hazard.I believe the nature of the Chinese government is another reason for avoiding Chinese-made goods.I urge everyone to boycott Chinese-made goods and services!"
3,Not worth the price.,It's nice but I think it's very expensive for what it is. You can get the same quality for much less. This set is no different than what you'd get from your the closest department store in your area. That's why i gave it a 3 stars. Your ordinary sheet set that is overpriced.
3,happy I got my ten bucks' worth,"This dictionary would be a lot more usable if it were large enough so that the Persian could be easily read, but it serves me well enough for reading literary Persian, with help at times from online dictionaries. Both the English and Persian need updating (there are no entries for anything electrical, but you can find ""astrolabe"", for example). Each entry is presented in the order: source language, Persian entry, transliteration, gloss. One helpful feature for a new learner is that the author includes some difficult to deduce verbal forms instead of just the infinitives. The size is handy for using while reading (app. 5"" X 6.5""), and by rough estimate contains 29,000 entries (40 entries per page X 726 pages). I was able to get this through a Turkish bookseller for a reasonable price, and am happy that I got my money's worth, though it would not be adequate for a serious study of modern Persian."
2,Ummm...pray for silverware?,"This is a Christian fiction book. I knew this before I got it since I had read one just before this and figured it can't be that bad. Yeah, it was that bad. If you're not religiously-inclined, you may want to avoid it. It started out great but quickly petered out and there was just too much preachy stuff to keep it enjoyable to me. I mean, I usually don't mind some references to religion/God/prayer but I hit my limit when they prayed for silverware. That's a tad materialistic, no? Also, I should add that I had to keep reminding myself that this book is supposedly based in England because it sounds so American."
4,SWEET EASY READ,This is a SWEET romantic story about finding faith hope and love IN the charming English village Gresham. Predictable yet entertaining read.
3,Pretty good,Light hearted and great story line but I thought it was a little preachy. Not fond of books that do that.
3,History majors will grind their teeth,"In all, this is an enjoyable book and well written. That said, the writer has taken a slight familiarity with British history and culture, and written a book that screams, wriiten by someone totally unfamiliar with both the historical period, and the rigid class consciousness of 1860/1870's Britain.The jaring social and technological mistakes kind of ruined it for me. It could have used a good gaffer."
4,The widow of larkspur inn,Good book. Enjoyed the story of how a single parent can overcome adversity with the help of friends and strong faith.
5,Widow of Larkspur Inn,I loved this book I couldn't put it downIt was well written you could place yourself at larkspur inn
5,Enjoyable read,"What a good story. A true romance and very believable.Be prepared to smile, cry and be happy. Easy read."
4,Excellent.,Enjoyed this book from beginning to end. Descriptions of characters made them come to life. Will purchase more books by Lawana Blackwell.
4,Great story and wonderful characters.,Fast paced and real. I felt like I knew all of them. Will look for more books from Ms. Blackwell.
3,Bogs down and becomes a religious tract.,"I got this book as a free download, and it is certainly worth free. I wouldn't pay $12 for it though. The writing style is fine. The first 2/3 are mildly, wholesomely entertaining. But the story bogs down and becomes increasingly boring. It is hard to get interested in a character who freaks out when her son ""gambles"" for marbles. It is harder still to be interested in other adult characters who agree with her. The story disintegrates into a religious tract and becomes 100% boring at that time unless you are into that stuff."
3,?,"Not sure what I thought this book would be but nonetheless, it was boring. Don't get me wrong it was sad,I hate finding out about wives being the last to know sheister husbands and the poor family he leaves behind.She makes progress and yet it is just really a story of her turning things around and developing skillsshe didn't have but was forced to learn. After reading to the point of my 2nd sentence, I probably should not have read anymore, however I just kept reading hoping for a bright spot or a positive potential be it a suitor, monetary windfall or invention of a great skill but it just didn't read as if it were going that way. After feeling myself getting down I finally gave up on it a little 1/2 past, I mean if it hasn't gotten better somewhat by then...I don't think sad is my genre."
3,"Ok but lengthy, slow, and bordering on boring","This book is ok if you can't find anything else to read at the moment. It's a nice story, but the story is long, drawn out, slow, and bordering on boring. It's an easy read in that it passes the time if you've nothing better to do. I'm so glad this book was a free book, otherwise I would have definitely regretted spending money on. If you want a time filler it's for you. If you want a good interesting read look elsewhere. I wouldn't recommend buying it though. Save your hard earned money. Get for free or the library or don't bother."
5,Great book!!,Loved this book!! Got it free for Kindle but have purchased the other 3 in the series. This book has great spiritual applications that we all deal with on a daily basis. Not to the extreme the characters in the book do but yet it causes us to remember that God is always there to help no matter how long we have ignored His love. LOVE these books!! I especially love Mr. Trumble.
3,Lack of Climax,"I was excited about reading this book. Until I realized there is no good climax, and I had to put it down less than 1/2 way through. On to the next book - are there any good books out there?"
3,A very pleasant read,I enjoyed reading this book. It had romance and yet it made you think of what is right. With morals we seem to lack in some books.
2,Written for a religion class?,Very disappointing. The story of life in a small town was really well done. The people were varied and believable except for their overpowering need to bring their faith into everything. They prayed for things like silverware and the right words to say when talking with someone. This is a gentle and interesting story but be aware that it will preach to you. I believe when there is this much religion in a book there should be some indication of that in the description.
3,Neat and Tidy,"I enjoyed reading this book, but it certainly seemed that most of the plot lines were resolved quite easily, unlike real life."
4,An enjoyable read,"I truly enjoy reading this novel. At first, I was a little overwhelmed by the number of pages, but as I got into it, the pages went quickly. The story was very well written as and I would certainly recommend this book."
2,Misused Potential for a great game,"First off, this game was designed explicitly for multiplayer, and if you want to utilize multiplayer you will need a GBA and GBA Link Cables for each player other than player one. Someone will have to carry the chalice as well. This game is fun, but when playing solo you are constantly reminded of how much better it would be if you had friends with you. Thanks to a gimmick this game falls far from greatness. It's worth five bucks or less (I paid less). For RPG afficionados it's worth a look, but the interface is clunky and not for people who aren't already interested."
1,frustrating.,"I'd always wanted this game, but never got the gumption to buy it. I eventually purchased a used copy and was severely disappointed. as the Game Informer review says, gameplay is 'frustrating' and the plot was completely lacking. When I played i saw no point. There was no saving the world, no powering up awesome weapons, just running around in a bubble. I expected more from a game from square."
4,AWESOME,"This game is awesome. The only drawback is that you need 2+ GBA's and 2+ GBA link cables to play multiplayer and because of this I haven't gotten to yet. Good thing the single player is AWESOME otherwise I wouldn't reccomend it to anyone, but it is so I reccomend it to everyone."
4,Fresh Twist,"I've been waiting for this game for what seems like ages. I've read review after review, and I still stand impressed. I like the new ideas being incorperated into the game. So, the grafix aren't FF-X. Big deal. Look at the Wind Waker. Everyone thought that grafic style was horrid, but the game sold well. I stick with the title of this review, ""New Twist"" and I can hardly wait to buy this game and play until my fingers fall off!"
3,not FF7,"I bought this because I thought it might be like FF7. It wasn't. I think it was intended for an audience younger than I am. It's not a bad game, there's just too much competition in the market now to recommend an average game like this."
3,Does not seem like a real FF game,"As an avid FF player since I was 9 and got the original Final Fantasy for NES, up to X-2 now I must say this seemed like the most 1 off version. Putting the crappy MMORPG of FF XI, and the legend series on Gameboy, this one rates just above them, down on the bottom of the list of final fantasy titles. I played this a few times at a friends house and was disappointed with the story and gameplay mostly, the charachters seemed like they were for little kids. The Final Fantasy series was always meant to be 1 player, a real pain in the butt difficulty wise, consume a lot of your time, and have such a great story that you get drawn into the game and feel as though you are the main charachter. This game was just way to easy, but I will give Square credit for trying something new, but as they learned with Tactics and the horrible FFXI they should just stick to what they know best, and with FFXII on the way for PS2 they are going back to that tradition."
3,replacement filter,"it is very hard to get a replacement filter. The manufacturer did not code the filter properly. I have one and it is very dificult for me to buy the filter i and trying for 1 week know, last month i bought 2 they did not fit."
4,good but not great,"Batchelor's book is now a classic. I reread it and found many insightful ideas here. He knows the dharma deeply and he communicates it with ease and clarity. I think his message, of a Buddhism cleansed of dogma, has taken root in the US. I hope it grows strong."
4,my second book in Buddhism,"... then, i started on this, to get even a clearer idea.i think this book needs constant concentration, you can't leave one paragraph without focus, or you will find yourself at the end without knowing what the book was talking about. But then, Buddhism requires you be here, so you should be.i was very interested in the 'death' chapter, the philosophy of death in Buddhism is questionable, but worth the thoughts."
1,Very disappointed,"I was very disappointed with this book, especially after reading the positive reviews."
4,Aversion to Dogma,"In dharma practise awakening requires equanimity toward the sensations that will otherwise lead to craving and aversion. Here's the thing: I have a strong aversion to dogma, especially religious dogma.While Stephen Batchelor is not condoning any such aversions, in ""Buddhism Without Beliefs"" he does present and even advocate for following a dharma path absent of traditional Buddhist beliefs such as karma and rebirth. Amen!It's not that I don't belief in karma and rebirth, it's just that I don't know. I am not opposed to living my live as if they do exist, it's just that to believe in such things requires a dogmatic faith. Which is something that I don't have ... and I'm equanimous with that.Agnostic Buddhism -- now that's refreshing!"
4,Court Procedural with Quirky Humor for Good Measure,"What fun! Jonathan Miller writes a sort of court procedural tale, quite in keeping with his lawyer-self. Add romance, a pinch of creepy suspense, interesting characters, and a marvelous New Mexico backdrop and it makes for good entertainment.Don't forget to look for the humor in his books, too. Miller is a very funny guy. ""Volcano Verdict"" comes out fall 2006.--Janet Grace Riehl, author Sightlines: A Poet's Diary"
5,GREAT Condition! Was REALLY like NEW!!!,Item arrived on time and the seller was VERY helpful. I would definitely shop with them again. The item was in REALLY great condition!!!! We have had no issues with the game and my kids play it almost everyday. Thanks!!!
2,Comes Nowhere Near the Greatness of the Original,"I bought this to play on my new Wii because I never did buy a gamecube, and man was I ever let down. I have a SNES system pretty much just for the original mariokart. It's great, it's something that challenges everyone and can be enjoyed by kids and adults. Double dash is so infantile it sickens me! The battlemode options are terrible! Who wants to play on top of a gamecube? That's the most uninspired thing I've ever seen! And other venues such as cookie land? I wanted to see sequels to the original, advances in the game but the same basic concept. This game is for kids much like the N64 version, look toward the gameboy DS for a better mariokart. A serious let down. If you liked the original at least rent it before you buy it just to see if I'm telling the truth here."
1,Not working (rev 3),The disk came very scratched up!! It would NOT READ or PLAY! It was a real disappointment for my 9yo birthday gift. I an unable to post what I really think about this issue. Censorship and protecting the seller from bad reviews
5,The best game ever,"This is the best game ever! If you want to play with your love ones, this is the best game to have with. You can be addicted to it sometimes, but that's a good sign for a good game"
4,Great Game,this is a sexy game it works on everything you would want I a Mario kart game. The party play is great but I could find better graphics on the N64 I still recommend it though
2,I've Already Played This Game . . .,". . . on the Nintendo 64.- Is there $50 worth of additions? No.- Is there $50 worth of better graphics? No.- Is there $50 worth of new characters? No.- Is there $50 worth of new gameplay? No.- Is two characters in one cart worth $50? No.- Is GC broadband compatibility worth $50? No.Face it, this game is not a sequel, it's an expansion pack. Moreover, single player is no fun at all. Has our society become so blind that we spend money on games that WE ALREADY HAVE all the while there are people in other countries who are STARVING? I mean, give me a break, donate $50 to a worthwhile charity and play the N64 version for crying out loud."
4,And the Mario Kart Series Rolls On,"Although overall the game is not perhaps as impacting as Mario Kart 64, Double Dash is certainly worth buying. The innovative and chaotic element of two players on each kart enables for more depthy strategy, a wider cast of characters, and a much faster experience. The only drawback is the levels. Although some are excellent (DK Jungle, Mushroom City, Rainbow Road), others seem relatively weak (Baby Park, Luigi Raceway). Overall, the course are nothing but average. It's a shame. If not for that, I'd have surely given it 5 stars. Luckily, the gameplay is good enough that you will seldom notice the flaws in level design. Also, this game is by far the hardest Mario Kart made. 150 cc tests even the most skilled Mario Kart veterans, and to no surprise, you can easily be screwed out of winning a race. Of course, this adds to the game's depth and makes it much more gratifying to win the circuit mode. All in all, a must-have for any GameCube owner."
4,It's a good game...but...,"It doesn't have that good ol' Mario Kart feel. It's very competitive, and fast paced. I'd say it's much harder than the two before it. But you feel like you're trying too hard to win a race (which is actually a challenge here), than just having fun. I feel as though they've modified the controls a bit, the carts tend to drift around more than before, and the subtraction of the jump ability, along with modifying the power turn (to make it harder), along with Ai improvements and the good old fashioned ""cheating"" AI characters , this game can be very frustrating at times.However, for you Mario Kart fans looking for a new game, look no further. I wish it had not been quite so frustrating, but I definitely recommend it."
4,"It's pretty fun, but nothing new.","Mario Kart has gone through so many transformations and so many consoles, that they're all looking pretty much the same. The difference is that you get to choose two characters, and each car has a different attribute.Overall, it is a very fun game, and the cartoony graphics (Nintendo trademarks!) are very fluid and clear. Kids, teens, and young adults would enjoy this game a lot. This would be a fun game to play, but I'd say you should only pay $40 for it."
4,Lady Racers Golden Moment,"Omfg I love this game so much. I got it with my black Gamecube cause my purple one broke.. oh well. I never played the first Mario Kart so this was entirely new to me, but oh so fun. Each kart holds two people, one driver and another to chuck stuff around the track. There's three kart categories: light, medium, and heavy. The light karts have great acceleration, but poor speed and weight. Medium karts are well-rounded and average. Heavy karts are fast and stocky, but have really bad accel. The graphics and backrounds are great, and some of the tracks are so original, but I won't give those away.If anybody is ever interested, I wasted some time and made a giant list of all Mario Kart: Double Dash! components, with items, characters, karts, and tracks. Just send me an e-mail requesting the Mario Kart guide."
3,WHERE'S THE CHALLENGE??,"Let me just start off by saying that this is my first Mario Kart game. If all of the games in this sieries are this easy, then Nintendo needs to learn the meaning of CHALLENGE. I played this game for 1 week and beat it very easily. I mean, the racing part is pretty cool with all the hidden shourtcuts and traps, that part I liked. But it wasn't very exciting and the game as I said is way too easy. I reccomend this game for a seven or eight year old and this would be their first racing game. I also should say that I didn't think this game was worth the $50 at all. Should you get this game, WAIT UNTIL THE PRICE DROPS, TRUST ME!!"
4,"More of the same, but nothing wrong with that...","There are some games that are just classics. They can survive successive transitions to the next generation of consoles without much change, and Mario Kart for the Gamecube is fundamentally no different than Mario Kart on the SNES. Sure, the graphics are better, and there might be a tweak here or there, but the game is the same - and that's why it's great. After all, if it ain't broke...The two cool new features that this game does include is the addition of an extra character on your Kart and specialized items for each one. This means that (1) you can have twice as many items at a time, and (2) selecting a character is now based on special item, in addition to speed and handling. Otherwise, Mario Kart is just the same brilliant game it always was."
4,Mario hits the speedway!,"this is the hot mario game to buy! Graphics= fabulous!you choose your two characters,your car, and circuit. It is a fab-feeling game and is co-ed and aged for 7 and up! its a good first game to buy when you just by ninttendo gamecube. it gets you familiar with the controls!"
2,Terrible,"Having played Mario Kart: 64, I had huge expections for the hopefully advanced Gamecube version. I was truely dissipointed.Reasons:- Very small. The tracks are very small. It takes less than 30 sec to compleate most races, most while Mario Krat: 64 races take me 2-7 minutes to compleate.- The batteling is horrible. The batteling arena is very small, and the only enjoyable (Which saved this game from 1 star overall) batteling segment is where you throw bombs at each other.- The replay isn't good. This game takes 1 hour to master for the average gamer to beat.Basically, the major downfall of this game is that it is too small. In the N64 game we had fun, and sometimes long race tracks. Hopefully, Nintendo will improve..."
5,10 years later and still as fun as the original!,"Like many reviewers, I have a long history with Mario Kart, and I couldn't resist buying Double Dash as soon as I could find it... I was incredibly surprised with the graphics, the race courses and the unique two racer (driver, thrower) setup, and it's addictive nature gets both me (and my wife) immersed quickly.My only beef, (and this doesn't change my 5 stars!) is that they haven't made a battle mode similar to the original Mario Kart on the Super Nintendo. The new battles are fun but they get resolved very quickly, where with the original, two good players could stalk each other for 10-15 minutes before getting an upper hand... With all the new characters and weapons, maybe this could be considered for the next Mario Kart?"
4,My favorite case,"The case itself is the only thing I have used on my ipod nano since 2007. It has protected my beloved friend from several hard falls and years of exposure to metal flakes, ceramics, dust and other abrasive materials. Because it is made of thick silicone, it just bounces when you drop it instead of smashing into the ground.It is a little bulky, which makes it harder to play games, and the bottom of the ipod is slightly exposed. I do have a few nicks around the edge in that area, but that is all."
2,No interest.....,"We bought this for my son last Christmas when he was 13 months. He had no interest in it at all. I thought maybe it as because it was a little old for him, but a year later he could still care less. It will be joining the rest of Smartville in my next yard sale."
3,2003 is much better,"In short, if this game had come out last year, and FIFA 2003 had come out this year, it would have seemed the more logical progression. FIFA 2004 is a clunkier, slower, more disorganized, less sharp game than 2003.Career mode is awful (they need to get some Madden Franchise developers involved), which was really the only reason i bought this instead of sticking with 2003.The gameplay has significantly worsened for some reason: it is IMPOSSSIBLE to score. I would say that, 1 on 1 with the goalie, i missed about 85% of the time, with world class players no less, on semi-pro mode! And it gets no easier with time. Also, the flow of the game is slower and not nearly as fun as 2003.Save your money, go buy a used 2003 version, trust me it's way more worth it."
2,very bad game,"I have been a fifa player since 98 and must say without a doubt that this is the worst version yet. The controls are so slow I thought there was something wrong with the game. The players are not responsive as in 03. The crowds are great, the graphics are cool, practice mode is long over do. I bought this game on blind faith because ea has never let me down. I am very disappointed with this version and am getting rid of it ASAP. I was really trying to like it but couldn't. It's like they rushed it out without proper testing. There is no flow to the game, the players seem like they are stuck in mud. Don't waste your money on this game, 2003 is still the best version yet."
3,Very Good BUT!!!!..........,"I agree with the previous review on all points but no one has mentioned the goal score replays are way to short, sometimes not even showing them at all!! I've even had a few instances were I would score a goal and get a replay of the action happening at the OTHER END OF THE FIELD??!!!? I feel like returning this defective game back to EA for a refund!!"
2,"NO REALLY LIKE, GET DEFECTIVE ONE!!!!!","AFTER I RECEIVED THE ITEM. I NOTICE THAT IT'S BEEN OPEN BOXED. AFTER INSTALL THIS ON MY PHONE SYSTEM IT DIDN'T WORK. CONTACT THE MANUFACTURE TECH, THEY TOLD ME THE SYSTEM SET UP WAS VERY EASY. FLOWED THE INSTRUCTION INSTALL TO THE PHONE SYSTEM AGAIN, STILL NOT WORKING.THE MANUFACTURE TECH WAS TOLD ME THAT THE ITEM IS DEFECTIVE. SEND IT BACK TO SELLER AND GOT REFUNDED. BUT WASTE $35.00 ON SHIPPING AND NEVER EVEN ABLE TO USE IT AT ONCE!!!!!!JUST FELT IF THE OPEN BOXED ITEM SHOULD BE SHIPPED OUT AT THE FIRST PLACE??????"
5,One of Her Best Ever,"It is a change from the usual to have the story written from the male point of view. This is a man who never pushes, never forces and never schemes to intimidate the girl. I like him. I think he's a little too good to be true, but I like him.It is a mistake to think of Jayne Ann Krentz as merely a romance writer. I am an avid fan of classical mystery writers, and I find Ms Krentz' mystery plots to be among the best of the genre."
3,Quite funny,"I am a great fun of JAK. I like all her books, historical, contemporary and futuristic. That said, I was a bit let down with the specific book. Although the book was funny (especially the parrot), for the first time after reading 35 of her books, I could not relate to the characters, especially Elias. This Tal Kek Chara matrial art was a bit too much and the male character a bit too lost in it. I had difficulties getting to the first half of the book. To be honest, after the second half, I managed to enjoy it and have fun with all the water parallels but still, I was used to more by this author. It is still a funny book but it will never top my list."
5,WHEN IS THE NEXT CD?,"For many years, my passion has always been music. I am piano and guitar player.I used to listen to only classical and country music From all the types of music I used to listen to, Racine is my favorite. Since I come across Boukman's music in 1990, listening to Bouman Eksperyans CD becomes my passion. Boukman Eksperyans is the only group that brings our cultural root alive and subsequently joins people together in their deeply inspirational and soulful types of songs. I am a big fan of Boukman and I congratulate Lolo and Manze for the outstading work they are doing for all those years. I hope that God can protect and help you with all your are doing."
4,I feel that this product isn't as strong ...,"I feel that this product isn't as strong as other name brand tissues. When a tissue was needed, I had to use two. I loved the feel of the tissue and was particularly glad that it had no scent to it. I'd recommend this product to my family and friends."
1,NOT flushable,"These offer no more than any other tampon, it is still the same commercial rubbish with god knows what sort of harmful chemicals, as if it is not bad enough to sell such harmful products they are now saying that applicators are flushable?!Tampons are not flushable, applicators are not flushable, no matter how much they are advertised as such, they will still mess up the sewage system and still cause just as much waste."
1,not happy,"This style was smaller and more narrow than the pair of Reefs I currently have, so I was very disappointed and have to return them."
4,ruff rugged n raw,nuff ruffness is underground hardcore from the streets. the beats are dope and makes you wonna fight. it has that 93 unique sound that cant be duplicated. lyrics aint so original but the styles are tight. i recomend this cd to anyone who likes hardcore hip hop.
3,Quality multivitamin,"I am very satisfied with my purchase. In fact, I would recommend that you purchase the larger size. It does not upset my sensitive stomach. I used to use a ""Mega"" vitamin that dilvered many times %rda to support my rigorous life and workout routine but I find that this works just as well."
1,Bloated and gassy,I really wanted to like these vitamins. It made me extremely gassy and bloated. Couldn't even sleep. I Will try megafood vitamins
1,If you get weird headaches it could be these vitamins!,I was getting some weird headaches when I started taking these vitamins. I didn't even think it was the vitamins until I read another reviewer here. I'm not allergic to anything. Just be careful. I went back to my trusty cheap men one a days. Never had a vitamin issue before in my life.Update: My headaches did go away after I stopped taking these vitamins.
5,Awesome Multi from Rainbow!!!,I take the one a day for women by Rainbow and got this men's multi for my husband. Taking poor quality multi vitamins is pretty useless so I'm happy to be putting in quality vitamins into my body.
2,Good product,"Very good mix of vitamins that gives you a long lasting boost of energy. I feel healthier, I sleep 5 to 6 hours now instead of 7 to 8. I can feel that my immunity system got stronger, I haven't had cold or flu since I started taking it. My favorite part is that it's gelatin free since I don't consume any pork products. Forgot to mention that you can take it on an empty stomach with no funny feelings. I recommend taking it with or before breakfast for best results. And yeah. It's the cheapest on the market compared to other brands ."
2,Joint inflammation from tomato based lycopene,Tried these vits about a month ago. Within a day or so noticed soreness in joints of hands and knees. I have a sensitivity to nightshade family and especially tomatoes.The source of the high dose of lycopene in these vitamins is tomatoes. I took a few days to trace the source of inflammation to the the vitamins but was glad upon discovering the link. Stopped taking and cleared up within a couple of days and no problems since.
3,"The content is good, but I don't look forward to taking these","They should really put some kind of coating on these pills. They smell and taste pretty awful. No matter how quickly you manage to swallow one it still leaves a horrible aftertaste in your mouth that is hard to get rid of. And they are unpleasant to swallow because of the sharp edges. The pills are not fully rounded. They are like thick ovals so they have sharp edges all the way around that make them harder to swallow and hurt your throat as they go down. I have no idea why they would design them like that. The big multivitamins (Centrum etc) do not have these problems. Of course the contents of those are not as good, with cheaper, harder to absorb forms of the vitamins. I still haven't decided if I am gonna stick with these. I will have to see if I can get used to them I guess. They would be perfect if they just made them easier to take."
3,Vitamins that did not give me energy,"I have trouble with lack of energy. The vitamin I was taking gave me absolutely no energy. I was told, Rainbow Light would give me energy. I took one Rainbow Light and had a little more energy but subsequent doses never deliverd that little lift again."
4,good purchase,i like these vitamins and will continue to take them on daily basis. The size of the capsules is a little bigger than I would like but they are managable.
2,careful with one of the ingredients,"Ok, first of all, this multivitamin is very complete, it even has things others don't, which is really good. the problem is that it has too much of some things. If you look at the ingredients, you'll see that these pills contain saw palmetto which is a plant used for prostate health. Some people claim it also helps hair regrowth. However, one of the side effects of it is that it can cause erectyle dysfunction! Believe me, I personally experienced this while taking these pills. I completely lost my sexual drive. In addition to that, it also caused insomnia! Do your own research and you'll confirm what I'm telling you. I could not even finish the bottle. Be careful with saw palmetto."
1,where's my movie??,"Hello,I have NOT received the movie I ordered ""The Big Easy"".Please mail it to me ASAP.This is the 2nd time I've commented on this issue to you.And for my dissatisfaction with my order,please mail me a free coupon to use should I decide I want to order from you one more time.Thanks,D. J. Nasby"
5,angelplustwo,It's a great movie. Owned it for years on VHS until someone borrowed and didn't return. Dennis Quaid is young and looks good. It's a nice romance with a pretty good police mystery. One of my favorites and hasn't gotten too dated as of yet.
3,The Big Easy,Dennis Quaid is very sexy. I now understand that this movie has a basis in fact about New Orleans police corruption. This was a good movie for the price at $5.79 and the music was good. I probably will not watch it more than once because of its subject matter.
1,Don't waste your time learning a little part of a song!,"This guy teaches you only one lick from various Skynyrd songs. On average about 10 seconds of the song. That's great if you just want to be a show-off, but most people will want to hear the whole song. Why bother learning just a snippet. Infact you will have to be a pretty comptetent guitar player to learn anything from this DVD. The instructor goes fast and you have to have alot experience playing guitar to catch on. I watched it once and put it aside. I prefer to spend my effort to learn an entire song. Maybe if you know the whole song but just can't get that signature lick down this might help."
2,More DVD's in the pack please!!!,I hate the DVD's when they toss one season over 4 separate purchases. I would rather wait next time to get the full season at once.
3,Not as durable,The size of the bag is great. Can easily fit a big stroller. The bag did have several rips at the end of only one international plane ride.
1,Did not make it through one leg of a plane trip,I recently purchased this bag for a trip to Florida. We gate-checked the stroller and car seat in this bag. When we arrived to Baltimore to change planes the bag already had huge holes in it. We continued using it on to Florida and then on the return trip. It got to the point we weren't sure if everything would fall out. I would not recommend this product.
2,Ripped after 1 use!,"Bought the bag for a recent trip, yes, it fit the stroller and car seat, unfortunately, after the first flight, it was ripped all over, after the second leg, more rips. I would not recommend this bag, it is nothing but a large canvas bag with no strength."
3,Midsomer Murders: Set 18,"I am a long time fan of this program. As soon as the dvd's are released I try to snap them up. Overall good, but was a little disappointed that some of the regular cast didn't show up. We saw a little of Joyce, the long suffering wife of Tom Barnaby. Would very much like the personal side of the Jones character developed more. I would have to say the episode ""The Creeper"" was my favorite."
2,Question,"While the crimes stories are always disturbing, we buy this show for the quality of the production in general. The scenery is beautiful and the stories are usually very interesting and the relationships somewhat funny. It just isn't your average crime story. I don't know weather to buy any further sets of this show or not. I found sets # 16 & # 17 to be very gory when compared to most of the previous sets. The gore overshadows the otherwise quality production at this point. Just because a crime is committed doesn't mean that they have to film every last drop of blood. If I wanted all of that and more, I could just watch Law and Order SVU. My question is, does the relentless gore continue in set 18 and beyond?"
4,Earlier kick-@$$ fun from Blink,"If I had to pick my favorite Blink cd, it would either be this album or Enema of the State. Blink's music is very simple, and that's why it is so much fun. Short, catchy punk songs that are easily remembered. The songs are fun to listen to, usually immature in their humor and far from serious, but that is why they are so enjoyable (although sometimes they do get serious in their songwriting, most notably with Adams Song on Enema of the State). Almost all of the songs on this album are good, my favorites are ""Dammit"" ""Dick Lips"" and ""Pathetic,"" there really arent any that I dislike. If you like Enema of the State, you should pick up Dude Ranch, too, both albums sound alot alike. If you are a punk fan, you need this album. Period."
4,Blink-182 Dude Ranch,"This album is good becuase all the songs are equally good. It was the last album with the drummer, Scott ""Mad Dog"" Raynor. Though Scott was a good member of the band, the drumming was not up to his full ability like in other albums. This album is better than Chesrire Cat. Recommended."
1,this is whats wrong with punk music today,"Punk was originally chaos..in a sense. No rules, going against the norm, and most of all..original. This, is the exact opposite. The whole album has the same bass lines and drum beat with slight variations from song to song. Also, it sounds like every other modern punk album out there (i.e., mxpx, nofx, etc.). Everytime i hear this album i get a headache. And if you don't take my advice, and decide to purchase this album anyways, please do your friends and family a favor, and listen to this album on headphones so the rest of the world won't have to hear this garbage."
3,Hey! This doesn't suck!,"I expected this to be really bad, but I am glad I picked it up for free. I figured the band to be some A&R's wet dream to catch the Green Day wave, but they have some fun catchy tunes. Not a lot here musically, but fun! Sing-Song......la, la, la............"
1,by no means is this punk,"Rancid is punk, Fear is punk, Helmet is punk. This album diplays nothing that resembles punk, or good music by any means. All it does is insult the pioneers of REAL PUNK. Yeah sure theyre a couple guys having fun, but please if your getting paid more than the military or the police force (people that deserve it) at least make something worth listening to. And try to come up with another genre for this besides punk...try candy-.... I havent bought this CD, but Ive heard it and I know you would have a better time listening to the grass grow."
1,GARBAGE,This group should have been named as STINK 182 instead as their type of music stinks explosively.This is not punk or rock music folks.This is total crap music.STAY AWAY FROM THIS TYPE OF TRASH.Get LONDON CALLING from THE CLASH instead.
5,this the best cd,this is the best cd ever i bought this cd because i had enima of the state and totaly fell in love with blink182 so i bought there other cds and like there other cds there are no bad songs on this cd i love them all! U must buy it its worth the money!
3,A decent album,"Although it is a decent album, I thought there was very little difference between songs. They all sound pretty much the same."
5,Dammit!,"I wasn't sure what CD had the song ""Dammit"" on it, but then I found it! I really like this song and usually listen to it at least once a week. It is a great song to unwind to."
3,Excellent Grower,"This was spicier than what I usually prefer. Good change of pace in my salads, but I prefer the Broccoli sprouts."
2,Bitter taste,"The seeds sprout well, it is true, but there is a bitter taste to this mixture. I use them on sandwiches and I thought there was something wrong with the non-fat mayo. Plain alfalfa sprouts taste much better."
2,"Book Fine, Wrong Edition...My Fault","The book was perfect. It was in good condition and packaged well. However it was nearly two weeks late due to problems with a backorder of the book. Plus, there was no picture of the book online, which had some hand in the ordering of the wrong edition. I don't blame Amazon.com for sending the wrong edition, because I clearly ordered it. However, I wish there would have been a picture to see the cover of the book or more description of the item on the website."
4,Loved it,"I am a huge Alice Hoffman fan and this book did not disappoint. Reading her books from newest to oldest seems kind of backward, but I can really see how she has grown over the years. She has honed her mystical approach to a subtlety that doesn't require it to be in every page. I really liked this book and felt a connection with basically all of the characters. The way that she brought Jessup back in to the story (and made a sympathetic character out of him) was no less than amazing. I went from wanting the earthquake to swallow him to being glad that he was back in Rae's life. It gives me hope that there are redemptive qualities in all of us. If you take this book on vacation be sure to take another...you wont put it down until you finish!"
4,it was given as a gift,it looked good but I didn't use it myself. the price was right. I don't know what else to say
3,Clear Cube Crystal Earrings,From the picture they looked to have some purple in them but they are clear just like the title says.
5,Gorgeous!!,"So sparkly and shiny, I fell instantly in love and more just like them!! Perfect size, not too gawdy and they don't look like costume jewelry."
4,Good game but has one problem.,Everything about the game is great except that you can almost never take a charge. I've been playing this game for a long time and i have never been able to take a charge.
4,I didn't get it yet,"Yo homegurlz and homeboiz out there I be MaRiO A.k.A 99 cent! I didn't by the game yet but i will (i'm saving up) I already got SIX dollars!!!!!!!! This game looks H-O-T HOT!!!!! I don't now who to start a season with but i think maybe blazers, knicks, cavilairs (with LeBron James and all:) or maybe relive the excitement of the NBA Finals 2004 and start of with the Pistons! But in till I get enuff bling-bling I'll let you no how i think of it :) Peace homieZ and nice knowing ya! And ALL WAYS have a ball :)!"
2,why bring out a game with no meaning . d. tyree italy,it only as very little good features realtic play of players and different sytle colored courts for each city but nba live 2004 is a big down fall no defense you can't drive to the basket like 2k3 and it's hard to have control of your players with the joystick because you have very little choices to pick from. game makers need to sit down with nba superstars and let them judge on how the want there fans to see them and how they want it played if vince carter really saw and play this before it was made it never would have been put out on the market.
1,this game sucks,you can shoot a 3 point leaner with shaq. fred jones is a 10 in dunking out of 99 and we won the slam dunk contest.it sucks. (...)
3,"What kind of ""high carbon stainless steel"" are they using?","I haven't used this extensively yet. It seems to be long enough to reach the bottom of most jars of spread that I have and he knife is good enough to cut sandwiches. The problem is the ""surgical quality, high carbon stainless steel"" that they say they use. It is not very magnetic. It has some magnetic attraction, but not enough to hold it onto my magnetic knife bars (Chicago Cutlery, Norco and MIU). If this didn't happen to be important to me I would give it 5 stars. I like the fact that it is US made. I'm tired of being forced into buying Chinese stuff."
4,Best Game Ever,I have many other games but this is the best game ever and I highly recommend it so go out there and buy it!!!!!!!!
1,they made tricky. were they drunk when they made this?,"first i want to say they took out eddie!!!! yes our favorite caucasian,disco lovin',michael jackson wanabee worse than justin t. is gone. and wat the f. is an Uber trick? they are translating in german now? in german uber means under. under trick? wats up w/ that?"
3,what are people talking about?,"i went to my sisters condo, and they had 1080 snowboarding for their gamecube. i really thought highly of it, and it made me want to get a snowboarding game myself. i looked at reviews and saw that the ssx series had better ratings so i bought ssx3. i liked the idea of long lasting runs down the mountain, which ssx3 has, but not much else impressed me. the music was the worst i have heard. i probably heard two songs that were good, and they changed them so it doesn't even sound right. most of the music is some sort of techno beat stuff that you might hear on a tekken game. i try not to have sound on while i play it. the scenery looked good, but the gamelpay was not fun for me. i was a big fan of 1080 on the n64, so i guess i should have went with that. the new 1080 has shorter runs, better music, better gameplay, and some very nice visuals. i have no desire to play my ssx3 anymore. i hate when games get hyped up so much. stick with what you know you like."
4,10x better than SSX Tricky!!!,"This game 3 times faster than SSX Tricky. The speed is more in the vein of Downhill Domination. Thank goodness! The only reason why I bought SSX Tricky was because I thought the game was as fast a Downhill D. due to user's review. Good thing I traded in SSX T for this. Graphics are a step up from SSX T. Characters look more modern. I miss the character interaction cutscenes from SSX T though. The size of the mountain is HUGE!!! Plus it has avalanches. And to think, I made myself LIKE SSX Tricky! Recommended if you like awesome speed/fan of Downhill D., xtreme sports, and if your not a fan of either, just try it. These games made me a fan of the genre (I'm into RPGs). Get or at least rent them to experience masterpieces"
4,great equip - onkyo dvd/cd 6 disc changer,"overall great stuff. minor issues - display is hard to see. when 1st turned on, have to wait for onkyo intro. also, it should rememeber my preference to repeat all 6 cds. but, great sound, plays burned cds, where the sony unit i returned did not. recommended. also like the option to adjust display brightness and the light that comes on when tray is opened makes it easy to read cds."
3,Haven't used it,"I wanted to learn this language because I made a new friend from Zambia, but am working on Swahili instead. Maybe someday I'll pick it up again."
5,Highly enjoyable,"The Columbo series represented the best in TV entertainment. The episodes are timeless, always great to watch. Too bad there are no reruns on TV right now."
5,A Wonderful Bedtime Story,"I have read this book over and over again to both my children over a period of almost 9 years, and it never gets stale. The artist has taken a simple nursery rhyme, and created an entire world. Each 2pp spread has both an overall beauty, and many fascinating individual elements. Many of the characters continue throughout the book, creating a fun ""where's the radish on this page?"" game that is more interesting than the popular ""I Spy"" books. I highly recommend this book for children ages 2-7."
3,"He speaks the truth, but a bit too much self-promotion for me","I was given this book to read from a friend of mine. I finished most of it, but read it considerably after it was published. Because it focuses on current events, and the politics going on at the time it was written, the book wasn't as timely for me. I do like how he approaches politics and Christianity. Both the Republicans and Democrats do have it wrong, and I agree with much of what he wrote here. I was just put off by his many references to the work he's done. He seemed to be patting himself on the back a little too much.I'd be interested to read something more current from him, just better edited."
3,So much repetition,"There were a lot of good ideas and talking points in this book but I got so frustrated with how repetitive it was. Seriously the author used the same exact phrases over and over on each page. I was also frustrated by how much he talked about himself, it came across as prideful at times. I was expecting a lot from this book and was a little disappointed, but still glad that I read it because it opened my eyes to some issues I was not previously aware of or could not properly articulate myself."
5,He Got It Biblically Correct,"This book explores the positions of both the political left and right and finds them both lacking sufficient Biblical substance and grounding. Especially helpful and thought provoking are issues dealing with the poor (most people know only one scripture dealing with the poor but there are many [dare I say hundreds] more), stewardship of resources, war, and what it really means to be ""pro life"". Recommendations are made to help politicians, particularly those who claim to be Christians, make better, Biblically based decisions."
2,"Delivers a subtly hateful, elitist message","The subtitle of this book is incredibly misleading; it should be ""Why I hate Bible-believing Christians."" Wallis is unrelenting in his construction of inaccurate strawman descriptions of politically conservative Christians and tearing them down with dismissive, ""progressive"" rhetoric. Wallis says he wants to communicate an authentic Christian faith, but what he communicates instead is how little regard he has for anyone who disagrees with him. And above all, he wants you to know what an important guy he is, how great a husband and father he is, and how many important people he has hobnobbed with. He is long-winded and provides very little insight. All in all, a colossal waste of time. Two stars is almost certainly too generous."
3,"Good message, over and over again.","The topic of this book caught my eye so I figured I try it out. I wish the book was more meaty, I want information about the people and parties in our political system, who is standing for what, etc...Instead this book bashs the blue and the red states, over and over again. It presents the same idea 50 times.Boring."
3,The Best Part is the Title,"I purchased this book to help me persuade religious friends and relatives that George Bush & Company were misleading the people by claiming to follow a Christian path. The book does help with this task but it is much too long and too redundant, filled with too many of the recycled articles and personal beliefs of the author and not enough of the facts that I was seeking with which to make my argument."
4,Musica es mi terapia,"COMO TE DIGO.... WELL I'LL MAKE IT SHORT AND SIMPLE. NO LONG REVIEW HERE JUST A COMMENT, BUY THE ALBUM, BECAUSE IF YOU KNOW ABOUT THIS LEGEND THEN YOU KNOW THIS IS ANOTHER ALBUM OF GREAT SONGWRITING AND GREAT GUITAR WORK AND JUST OVERALL ANOTHER SPECIAL ALBUM FOR YOU TO RELAX AND HAVE A DRINK WHILE REMEMBERING THAT GIRL ...... "" y LLORARE"""
4,Single player game makes up for multiplayer disappointment,"The single player game is everything a great game should be: good looking, fast paced, multi-faceted, and FRUSTRATING. I've spent hours playing the one-player game and would recommed it to anyone.The multiplayer game is a big disappointment, as many of the reviewers here claim. There is just one big screen, and you have to run around one big room and fight the other players. It usually comes down to fisticuffs because the weapons lock-on is so awkward.Don't let the multiplayer game stop you from checking the game out. More than one person can enjoy the game because it really is that cool to look at (and it's always nice to pass the controller from time to time)."
4,i hope its kool,i love james bond but his first person games were boring. now that they have a third person game i think i will enjoy james bond games a lot more!!!
3,"Fun Game, But Haven't I Played It Before?","""Everything Or Nothing"" looks great and sounds great, but beneath the flashy surface, it's just another third-person shooter, not very different than a dozen other games in the genre. There are some standout moments, like when you're chasing after a train in a suped-up Porsche or free-falling over a cliff to catch a screaming Shannon Elizabeth. But the rest of the game is pretty standard stuff, ie: duck-n-shoot, mow down three bad guys, reload, mow down three more, yawn. There's even a ""stealth"" mission near the end that feels completely tacked-on, like the designers said ""You know what this game needs? It needs a stealth mission. Yeah, yeah! A stealth mission!"" Completely uninspired.""Everything Or Nothing"" isn't a bad game, don't get me wrong. A lot of work has obviously gone into it and I'm glad that EA has finally let go of it's ""Goldeneye"" fixation. But it's not the ground-breaking, jaw-dropping, awe-inspiring game that it could've so easily been."
4,"bond, james bond","This is a great game, better than the ones before and not just because its easyer to see around u in third person. the handleing is great to even in the cars which are easyer to drive. the only problem i have with this game is the level ""Death's Door"" in which you have got to rescue mya. there are people hidden everywhere with guns but dont want to give away all the secrets. another thing is that they made like a movie because Q M and of course Bond are played by the people from the movies."
4,Rent it.,Its a great game but the only problem is you dont aim the gun. You press L1 and it locks on a enemy. Then you press R1 and it shoots. You allmost never miss. Otherwise the grafics are great and theres alot of levels to play. I would only recomend this game to people who really realy like james bond games. It isnt worth 50 dollars. Its worth 30 dollars. If you kind of want it rent it and see if you really like it.
2,Too much hype.,This game was fun at times but controlling the character was too frustrating with aiming and movement. Nuff said.
5,Excellent work centring on the trial of the Templars,"I own many books on the Templars, but very few deal primarily on their downfall on the Friday 13th, and the gruelling, protracted trials afterwards. The Templars have always fascinated me, an order founded on a vow of poverty that rose to become one of the richest and most powerful organisations of their time, a religious order, yet it was politics and money that sealed their fate and brought about their destruction.Very well written, it is rich in detail, but in a witty narrative that keeps the reader enthralled and forgetting they are reading history, which is usually dry and stale. High Recommended. Anyone interested in the Templars needs to add this one to their collection."
1,Dog hated every variety of BB plus it caused chronic diarrhea.,"My 12-year-old golden is a picky eater, granted, but she hated every variety we tried from Blue Buffalo. Plus, she had chronic diarrhea until we took her off of it. I know people swear by this but it simply didn't work for our old girl."
3,"Okay, but","I have tried several enzymes and this is okay, but I am just as happy with the ones from Puritans Pride for way less money."
5,Advanced Enzyme System,I've had a terrible problem with acid reflux in the past. I was eating Tums for dinner. Then I discovered the power of enzymes to almost totally alleviate the problem. When I take 2 enzyme capsules daily I don't have the problem unless I eat way too much acid-forming salsa or drink too much acidic bottled tea or soda. When my favorite brand of enzymes disappeared from the internet I turned to Advanced Enzyme System due to the wide variety of enzymes and other ingredients like turmeric at an economical price per capsule. I found that the product does the job for me as I am still heartburn-free as long as I have been taking it. I would definitely recommend this product for anyone looking for a quality enzyme formula at a very reasonable price.
4,Best of the Three,The author produced 3 Hoare books. This is the best of the three.The style is very good. I originally thought the book had be written in the 19th or early 20th century before I looked into the author.I would not have mistaken the period if I had first listened to any one of the other two books.If your going to read the book stop with this one. I dislike vulgarity in my reading and while this one had a little it was at least a background to the story. In the next two it seemed the author meant to be vulgar. Things that would never have been missed are used for no reason.
3,"Kindle Signet Turn of the Screw Plus is inferior to Bantam, ""Complete""","The Kindle Signet THE TURN OF THE SCREW AND OTHER SHORT NOVELS contains:An International EpisodeDaisy MillerThe Aspern PapersThe Altar of the DeadThe Turn of the ScrewThe Beast in the JungleIts introduction by Fred Kaplan is a little remote, and contains spoilers. The Bantam Classics TURN OF THE SCREW with other stories has what I think is a better selection, including WASHINGTON SQUARE.Meanwhile the near-free COMPLETE HENRY JAMES, a purely ebook collection, has all these selections and many major novels as well. Go with Bantam if you want a good selection of top nouvelles and short novels. Go with COMPLETE if you want a lot of Henry James and can make your own choices about what's good."
3,Title,"If you are just wanting the story, don't get this version. This version has all of the analytical stuff in it. The print is very little, too."
3,Few exercises!,"I got this book from a friend in Istanbul because I wanted to start studying Turkish but I hadn't managed to find anything good in my city. The book came with no tape so learning was at first hard (luckily I can count on Turkish friends).I think it is good in the first lessons when stuff is really easy but then it becomes rather sketchy. Some grammar points are barely mentioned such as the ""must"" and ""need"" usage, I think more explanations would have been useful. There are few exercises.Anyway, it is good to learn the very basics of the language but when you get the 10th lesson, you realise this book isn't enough. For this reason I ordered a new book from Amazon."
4,On content and presentation...,"I was looking for a book that had in depth information about how the language works, as well as one with good examples. With the exception that the first edition does not have the tapes the book refers to (or the phonetic description of how to pronounce the Turkish words) the book is very applicable to one that expects to travel to Turkey or to another Turkish speaking state in a time frame of 3-6 months."
4,definitely useful!,"Thanks to this book, I was able to arrive in Delhi at midnite, go to the taxi stand at the airport and not wonder where I would end up for the night. I had already made arrangements to stay in an ashram in Delhi that night. And taxi drivers don't give you the hotel runaround when you tell them to take you directly to a particular ashram. For that alone, this book was worth every penny to me.I would recommend reading it before you go because some of the places/people to be contacted must be done ahead of time. and you may find that contact information can change sporadically in India (one of the many beautiful challenges you'll find on your travels there)."
4,Beautiful set.,Very pleased with the set however my 1st set showed up broken. Cost me $38 to ship it back only $20 was reimbursed. not happy about the extra $18 I had to pay for the set.
1,Seiko SLL086 JUNK !,My wife bought this for me as a gift. She paid over $300 6 years ago. It worked fine until the battery died after about 4 years. I went to several Jewelers but none could replace the battery. It had to be sent to the Seiko Service center in new Jersey at a cost of $30!A few weeks later I received the watch and it was keeping good time but the second had jumps every five seconds. I returned to the jeweler and he contacted the Seiko Service center to see what was going on. I was informed that the watch had to be resynced at a cost of $160 !!!!!!!!SEIKO NEVER AGAIN !!!!
1,Don't waste your money,"This game is terribly pure and simple. First, the graphics are poor, the players looked distorted, with overally large heads and feet. Second, the game play and controls are poor, with the game handling nothing like real college basketball, and poor button placements. Finally, reality? They can't even get stadiums correct on the inside. They don't look anything like what they are supposed to be. Save your money, if you really want a good college basketball game, get ESPN College Hoops, you won't be dissappointed."
3,"Some parts are fun, others not so much","I have to say I do like the game but there are so many problems it really ruins the whole thing.1. Having to choose your favorite team every time you turn the game on. Really annoying, not really a problem but you think they could have fixed that BEFORE they shipped the game.2. The load times are soooo long. A game takes 20 mins to play but it takes 10 mins to boot the game up & another 10 mins to save the game. So you spend an hour playing just two games. Not too much fun if you wanted to play a quick couple of games in Dynasty mode.3. No auto save?!?! They have auto save for your profile, why didn't they enable this feature for Dynasty mode?!?!Don't get me wrong, I do enjoy this game buy it can be a chore to play. No one wants that when they are trying to relax and have fun."
4,If u get this game you have got to get nba Live,This game rocks if you do get it though remember you have to get live with it. or a leat you should so you can import the draft class that makes it so much fun. Like say you are a bad team. At least you will know how good the players are in the draft. there for you know who to pick and who to not pick so get it and then get live.!!!!
1,way too expensive,"buyer beware: there are only 8 small packs. i got such ""8 packs"" at $2.79 from a nearby store which usually sells at a high price because it's the only grocery store around the campus area. i naturally, but mistakenly, thought the ""8 pack"" here means 8 packs of one small pack (i.e. 64 small packs). i am still at a loss to understand why it's more than 3 times the price of the usual cost."
3,good game but way to hard.,Ihave been at this game ever sceince christmas and i haven't gotten past the first level yet. i've done it so many times that the first part is a snap and i get by it in 5 seconds.Other than that it is a great game and has great graphics but i would only recomend this game to people who have had some experience with megaman Z. That was my first megman zero game i have ever used but i have beat the megaman legends.
4,"Created, The Destroyer",I chose this rating because it was a good book.I liked this book the story kept you interested all way through.I will refer book to friends.
3,good,"There was not enough Chiun in this one. I usually recommend people start with book #3. The thing that really makes this book good is the forward by Chiun, very funny, very cool, very...well...Chiun."
1,worst amp ever,"i had it working good for a month. one night wile blasting it, it blew.it was well vented and did not overheat. DO NOT GET THIS AMP"
2,"Leonard Cohen, Great Poet and Songwriter; Mediocre Novelist","I love listening to Leonard Cohen's music (even sung by others)and his poetry is an intriguing synthesis of the accessible and the cryptic. This novel, however, within which there are genuine flashes of insight and poignancy, ultimately falls flat. The central protagonist doesn't change much -- which I suspect is Leonard's point. But, this we get right away. Also scenes with the protagonist's Jewish mother are way over the top -- but they do anticipate Philip Roth's Sophie Portnoy."
3,?,"Well, today i took out this book at the library and so far (about 5 pages in), things aren't looking so good. i've read the synopsis and heard rave reviews about this novel, so believe me, i WANT to enjoy it. but things ain't looking too bright yet. Perhaps the novel is too advanced for me-that must be it. maybe with age i will enjoy this book. but, for now.....it bites."
1,Don't buy from seller,"Do not buy anything from this seller I bought a simple keychain an never got it but the seller made sure he took my money I tried messaging the seller an he never got back go me, so I then contacted amazon and I finally got my money back. I would never buy from this seller again!!"
4,cute stuff,"All right, I don't actually own this album. My grandparents do. Avid Beatle fan that I am, though, I find myself continually swiping this CD from their collection for a listen. I love the fact that Goldie Hawn sings ""A Hard Days Night"" and that Jim Carrey and Robin Williams exercise their voices as well. This is a great CD for anyone into the Beatles, or into celebrities at all, for that matter! An unusual twist on many old favorites...George Martin did a great job! :)"
1,Run...do not walk...AWAY!,"Probably one of the worst concept albums of all time. Banal Hollywood drones attemping to cover Beatles' songs should have ended with the Rhino ""Golden Throats"" series."
4,Compelling arguments; 'must read' for investors.,"Quick, compelling arguments to change the way you think about the economy and the future. Well written and easy to understand, and fairly light reading for economics. ""Must read"" for investors, those approaching retirement, etc. Especially important for those with a lot of debt, or thinking about doing a lot of borrowing. Not a 'doomsday' piece, but very thought-provoking as to understanding new ways to win in investing."
1,doesnt fit,"I ordered this as a custom designed holster for my Taurus PT145. It does not fit right, my gun does not slide far enough into holster for closure to snap. Basically wasted 50 bucks."
3,"Photoshop, not Photography","Philip Krejcarek's DIGITAL PHOTOGRAPHY has been succeeded by later editions and it was very necessary. This title is misleading, the book is also most entirly devoted to early Photoshop techniques.Today with all the developments with both digital photography and Photoshop the title becomes something of a curosity that could be used as an assignment to explain the changes of the last dozen or so years.Nash Black, author of SANDPRINTS OF DEATH."
2,"Good politics, terrible novel","True believers in the theory that the Democratic Party / left liberal political establishment is more interested in maintaining party power than in the good of the country, and is willing to intentionally demean and degrade the American public to accomplish that end will give this book 5 stars. Anyone who believes that story threads should be continuous, that grammatical rules should be followed, or that a good proof-reader or spell-checker should review a book before it is printed will give this book 1 star. Technical errors abound as well. Being a true believer I liked it. If I were an English teacher, I would use it as an example of how not to write a book."
1,I guess they didn't want to make Frontline look bad!!,"There is no way anyone who played Frontline, or even the older MOH games, that can say this is a good game. Compared to the others this is horrible, in every way. From the sound, the graphics, all the way down to the main menu. It is just not in the same class as the others. So if you liked the others I recommend saving your money if your expecting this one to be similar. Its not."
2,Needs more gameplay options...,This game is just all right. We enjoy playing it on 4 player & teaming up. I wish there was an option for auto target or an option to see your man but there's not. The boards are a lot smaller on multiplayer. I think this is a good game to rent but don't recommend purchasing it.
2,Dissapointed,"After playing Medal of Honor: Front Line, Rising Sun was a dissapointment. The game is very short, for $50 price. I am a dad who only plays part-time and I completed this game with ease. The enemy seems to just stand and reload while I shoot them. There was not many levels, and they were easy to figure out. I would suggest spending your time and money on something else."
1,Back to Frontline,"Well Rising Sun was not at all what I expected! Finished the game in two sessions of 2-3 hours, and when I thought I had completed a level, it was finished.Frontline took me just shy of two weeks of 2-3 hours of play a day and I still went back and played it again and again. It is an awesome game and it is back in the PS2. Rising Sun is the next game I will be trading in at the local electronics store.If you want it know what the game is like, rent it first..... If you really like it after that then go and buy it, if not you only wasted $10."
5,the best,this is the best game i ever played! it has many levels and multi-player stuff. you can be on a team or against a buddy. i play rising sun with my brother every day after school. on a multi-player level the japanese come into a house where i hide and kill me but if my buddy dosent die i come back to life to kill the japanese. this game made me like WWII and helped me in school.GET THIS GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3,Barely Average.,"When I first started playing this game, it seemed really fun. Like when you have the machine guns and are shooting down the Zeroes. (It was a bit unrealitic in that you could shoot down 30 in a matter of about 5 minutes, but it was still fun.) Then, I got to the level The Fall of the Philiphines. I ran up to a Jap and started shooting at him. He shot at me back, but his fellow soldiers just stood there and looked at me. And when I had to reload, they waited for me, and when I had reloaded, they began to fire again. ""Wow, this is stupid!"" I thought to myself. The A.I. was so terrible that they sometimes didn't even shoot, much less work in a team. If you want a real war game, try Call of Duty or Battlefield 1942. Just save your money and don't buy this game."
1,big mistake,"Don't even bother. I was so disappointed by the first two levels that i quickly resold it. Everybody was praising and hyping up the opening attack on Pearl Harbor as better then the beach landing in MOH Front Lines, but MOH Rising Sun dropped a big fat bomb. If you like shooter games buy SOCOM 2 for sure."
2,Think This Is A Good Buy Think Again...,This game looked good when in all truth it is a mediocre game. The levels where allright and the game was WAY TO SHORT it did not take me very long at all before I got to the end. Which really sucked by the way. The multiplayer is allright that's probably the best feature of the entire game. I have not tried the Online so I do not know if that is worth buying the game for 49.99$ The game really is probably a 2.5 I hoped this helped you I wish I would of read a review that would of told more of the TRUTH about the game..!!
1,Absolutly fu**ing sh*t game,"I am a very big fan of the medal of honor series. I have had evert medal of honor part dating back from the PS one.I was really hiped up for theis game, and when it came out i went and bought it for 40.The starting scene is a pile of sh*t compared to medal of honor frontline. I completed the fu*king game in 2 hours flat. anyperson who wants to buy the game, i insist you rent it out. This is probably the worst ever game that has been released on PS2.All the the people that think that this game is good are sad and need a life."
2,"Rent, don't buy","This game has some very beautiful and exciting battle scenes. However, my main complaint is the length of the game. I finished the game in 3 short nights (about 7 hours). When I reached the end, I couldn't believe it. I spent $45 for 7 hours. Maybe the online play makes it worth the price. If you are not a online player, rent it at blockbuster. Its worth the rental for the pearl harbor scenes."
3,"Good game, falls way short of expectations...","Better than most games out there, but finished single player way too quickly!!! No climactic ending like frontline. Save $50 if you don't play online, because you'll easily finish the single-player game in a weekend. The game is very good, but I expected much more!"
1,not so great,at first i thought this game was great and everything but soon found out that it was horrible the graphics weren't that good and hardly any weapons were there and the single player is just plain boring after the first few levels. the online is ok but all it is is a free for all killing spree with no strategy whatsoever im glad i just rented this game and did not buy it
1,FLUSH 50 BUCKS,GARBAGE. IF YOU WORK FOR A LIVING PLEASE SAVE YOUR MONEY AND DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. This game is not your MEDAL OF HONOR. This should re-title it plastic crap with CD.
4,"Yes, It's Short. We All Know It's Short. GET OVER IT!","I wish everybody would just SHUT-UP about this game's length. Rising Sun has been out for what, eight months now? So if you're still crying about how short it is then either you don't have a life or you've been living under a rock. I just bought my copy for $19.95 at EB Games and that's a fair price for what you get.Another complaint that's often repeated in these reviews is how ""stupid the enemy is"", always running toward you. THAT'S WHAT JAPANESE SOLDIERS DID, you idiot! There not running toward you to shake your hand--they're trying to impale you with their bayonets! Get a clue.If you're a fan of World War II games (especially historically acurate World War II games), then Rising Sun should find a welcome home in your collection. It may be shorter than it's predecessor, Frontline, but the graphics, sound (THX!) and multi-player are definately an improvement. So get off your high-horse already and buy this game."
4,This game sucks!!!!!,"This game is nothing short of horrible. The graphics are bad, teh storyline is boring, and the game ends in a way that made me want to kick my TV screen in. Frontline was nore realistic not only with the graphics but the shear fact that if you shoot a guy in teh head with a sniper rifle, he's dead. Not those pesky Jap's, you need to shot them at least 3 times at point blank range with a high powered sniper rifle before they even think about falling. Anyhow, don't waste your money, if you like Frontline, keep playing it because you are going to be very disappointed in Rising Sun. The worst part about it is that I spent $50 on a game that took me less that 8 hours to complete and ended right in the middle of the story line. I'll play the sequel whenever it comes out but I sure as hell won't buy it, Video World here I come.P.S. I'm still pissed about this game!!!!!!!!!!"
1,AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"THIS GAME IS GREAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Yeah, for the first five minutes. Very unrealistic very stupid and very boring. I beat this game in 1 hour. I have beaten it 13 times in 4 days on the hard level!!!!!!!!! AHHHHHHHH it sucks!! I spent 35 dollars on it and it sucks!!Your friends cant die unless it is a video. You can get hit 30 times and not die. Graphics suck. There is one level were you have to be stealthy and not get heard or youll get caught, well, I took out my loud gun and just started shooting all over and nobody came to fight me!! You dont need skill to beat this game. Dont waste your money buying, or renting, this game. Get SOCOM 1 or 2 instead if you want fighting. The story sucks and so does the diologe and graphics."
2,Not as Good,"This game was not nearly as good as FRONTLINE. When you get shot, it takes away more health than necessary. Plus, the Japanese are excellent marksmen in this game (unrealisticly). I would buy a different game."
1,Horrible Game,"I bought this when it was first released for the PS2. I had high expectations due to its predecessor, Medal of Honor Frontline. This game was a huge disappointment to say the least. You start out sleeping in a bunk below deck on a naval ship in Pearl Harbor. The Japanese attack, and you need to get to the top of the ship and fight them off while you escape. So, the beginning of this game is not too bad, and I was mildly interested in the gameplay. Then things went downhill. I can sum it up with one sentence: Before I knew what was happening, I was done with the game. Yes, that is right: this game is so short it is not even worth the $ price tag. I beat it in about 7 hours, and that includes taking bathroom breaks and eating meals.Summary (out of 10)Graphics: 5Controls: 5Story: 3Gameplay: 2Overall: 3If you want a good military shooter, try Return to Castle Wolfenstein or Medal of Honor Frontline. Medal of Honor Rising Sun is not worth the time it takes to get the shrinkwrap off."
4,I HAD FUN,"This is a fine game for those that don't really like the ""gothic"" genre, yet still enjoy the modern day concept. Truth be told, I am not the biggest fan of psychics, which does not matter because I substituted my own form of magic. In any case it is an interesting read and should please role players."
3,Wobbly.,"This spoon rest is pretty, and cheap, and does what it's supposed to do. Those are all good qualities.It's a little wobbly, though. The ceramic isn't perfectly level on the bottom side or something, so sometimes it wobbles and the spoon falls out of it. It's also not big enough for my largest cooking utensils."
2,not very much fun for me...,"i just don't like playing this game ..i like ww2 games alot but this is just not fun for me.i thought this game was going to be a few steps ahead of the last axis and allies game. it's not,it's just very boring...."
1,DO NOT BUY!!,This game has play by email as the multiplayer version!!!! I mean the original Axis and Allies had tcp/ip at least! Are they trying to build a great game for the early 90s here or what?
2,I liked the premise,"I was pretty excited when I first read about this game since I am a huge fan of the 'Axis & Allies' genre of turn based wargaming. So I bought it on the day it came out. That is when the trouble began. I would get halfway through a turn when the game would crash. I waited until the first patch came out and downloaded it with no improvement. So then I posted on the tech support forum at the game website and got a pretty quick response that my sound card was too outdated and wasn't supported (in all fairness that part was true). So I went out and bought a brand new SB Audigy 2 sound card. When I tried to run the game I would get completely through the first turn and it would crash at the end this time. So when I posted to tech support again they told me that I shouldn't have bought a Audigy 2 sound card, that they have issues. So I sold the game on Ebay. Buyer beware...."
2,So close,I really wanted to like this game but it's just too slow and limited. (Read the other comments on this.) If you're an utterly diehard wargamer who doesn't mind sitting there while the AI makes all manner of moves might be OK will this. This can't be overstated... following every turn you could eat a meal while waiting on the AI to do its thing. The obnoxious thing is unless you sit and watch you might miss something critical. I couldn't imagine what it would be like with one or more human opponents. Plus as other comments have stated there are the built-in scenerios and that's it. The game's just not worth learning to hack alternatives.This game should've been so much more. Even just having an option of fast turns with end-phase balloons with blurbs of what happened in each area even would've been enough for me.Two overall stars for being so close and the work that must've gone in to create it. One for what it's really like to play.
5,Great Book for All Kitchens!,"This is a great book for every kitchen--novice to professional. Quickly and easily reference similar cuts of meat, types of cheese, fruits, vegetables, cookware, and much more. Organized alphabetically it's easy to use, concise, and quite comprehensive. A must have!"
1,Output is not stereo,"If you want to find a 2-way stereo output, please don't choose this, because this is a mono output, Unhappy, Don't believe it is the stereo output :-((((((("
1,Left/Right splitter not signal splitter,ordered Belkin F8V234AMOB 6-Inch Audio Y Cable received the Belkin F8V234 Speaker and Headphone Splitter instead. According to another review the Y cable is exactly that a Y cable that allows one signal over two ports. The headphone splitter on the other hand splits stereo into left an right channels. This is not an acceptable substitution.
5,A perfect soprano!,"Heard it for the first time on my local classical radio station. Many sopranos can sound too shrill or sharp but Ms. Battle's soprano voice is warm, round and smooth. The songs are interspersed with Battle's singing, baritone and choral. The music is of a classical nature reminiscent of arias and exultante masses. If you are tired of overplayed trite Christmas carols, the selections in this CD will make a new believer of you, guaranteed!"
2,All that glitters...,"Sometimes lovely but marred by an overall sense of caution. Kathleen Battle, who sang with such warmth on ""Pleasures of Their Company""(her ""Ave Maria"" on that recording is miraculous)reins her voice in on every song. Incredibly, she shies away from the vowel 'e', turning Maria into Mariah. As pretty and brittle as a glass ball."
4,good soprano,"This is a wonderful CD to play during the holidays. ""Rise Up, Shepherd"" is hauntingly beautiful. Battle is an excellent soprano. I enjoy hearing her renditions of traditional Christmas songs. The recordings aren't of the best quality, but it is still very good."
3,Great game but so far one of my least favorites.,This game was great with graphics compared to RE2 and 3. The game play was a tad bit annoying.. such as hitting the A button to go up stairs. Now for my biggest complant. The final boss is by far the biggest pain in you know where. I rated it this way because in general its a great game but it does not give you enough of certain things.
4,good game but not worth the money,"Not the best resident evil game, but still worth playing. I did enjoy the change of venue and the few new creatures that this game brought to the table. I was looking into buying this game because I love resident evil, but come on! 0ver $40 for a used game that's almost 5 years old (g.c. version )I even saw a new one listed on here for $500.00!!!!!!!! I understand it's a rare game, but that is ridiculous. You could buy a brand new xbox 360 and Nintendo Wii for that much and get much better titles in this series in brand new condition for like $15-25. Amazon please do a better job of protecting your customers from companies who seek to gouge us on rare games"
3,This DVD never existed!,"Since Amazon.com wouldn't print my second review of this item, I'm editing this to let the customers know not to order this. Why would you buy something that doesn't exist? Previously, I wrote about how there was something funny about this item. There's no such thing as ""Unicorn Video"", and I couldn't find this item anywhere on the world web. Turns out that when it was supposed to be released, it was discontinued immediately. I ordered it, and as has been the case with Amazon lately, nobody could tell me anything about this. Again, they've advertized a product that isn't even out. Poor customer service, and downright bad business sense has been their trademark as of late. It never used to be like this with them so I don't know what's happening. Shares are falling, and so is Amazon.com......by the way, since I can't change the star system, you probably know that this review gives this dud a big one star."
3,It's just a placemat,Cute placemat. Durable surface/plastic. But not worth the $5ish I spent. It is just a placemat afterall. Should be more like $2.
2,A good review book poorly translated to Kindle,"This book requires etensive reformatting to be useful on the Kindle. As it is currently formatted, sections are broken up with countless asides which are only tangentially related to the topic. In print, these notes are boxes in the page margins, but on the Kindle they are distracting interjections. the figures also need to be reformatted for legibility and size. I love my kindle for reading novels, but this is a good example of the kinds of content which suffers greatly in the move from print to ebook. This could have been much better with a little effort from the publisher."
4,Gimme some more,"I love this band and the concept of covering the original ""lame"" versions of the songs that they select for their CDs. You couldn't pay me to sit down and listen to the same songs by the original artists, but the Gimme's versions always pay off. My favorite is ""Have a Ball"" and this CD is right up there too. Great music to listen to on the way to work in the morning."
3,"Sorry, but it's just a compilation...","One of several books oh F-22 I'v got from Amazon. Frankly, I expect much more. It's just a compilation of beautiful Eric Hehz article in Lockheed's Code One Magazine and Lockheed media guide. Also, Hehs article is much more informative on development history. You could spend much less money, trying to print those sources after having find them on the net (they are available). I liked Sweetman's book more, but Aronstain's is simply the best (and expensive, in that way). But - let it be on your bookshelf. As for me, I found rare pic of pair of YF-23 there. BTW, N-14 was not internal Northrop name for YF-23. It was for B-2."
2,Press Release Redone,"Absolutely no original research as near as I can tell. It appears the author just copied the press material Lockheed sent him and added some pictures Lockheed sent him - no original photography either. And like the other McGraw Hill books in this series, it is on marginal paper. I can not recommend this book unless you find one in the second-hand store."
2,"Run, Run while you still can....","I have read the Assassini, and it was fantastic. However, I went back and read this, and was sorely disappointed. I think maybe Gifford just didn't have the maturity yet, as this is a young, angry novel, and leaves you saying so what. Assassinations, killing and Nazi intrigue aplenty, but unless you want it served up with incest, alcoholism, and other foolishness, read something else."
1,A clumsy collection of quotes from newspapers,"My oh my, does this book need some editing. It's basically a collection of quotes from newspapers that play up India's prospects in IT and software--that's all. The author conducted absolutely no original research, and resorts to hyperbole to get his point across. Poorly written, jingoistic, and poorly argued, not worth the time or money. Hard to believe Common Courage would publish such an unbalanced work."
4,They ruined it,"Why is this game being given such praise?? They took away the 3 click swing!!!! The reason all of the other PGA's and Tiger Woods games were so good was because of the 3 click swing. Now you just pull back the controller and let it fly. There is no risk when you hit a power shot...there's no reason not to always drive w/ the power shot on. The 3 click swing penalized you by making the margin for error greater. 2004 just lets you bring the joystick back and then foward. Why would they do this? It's totally ruined. Tiger Woods 2001 for PS1 is better. Any child can pick up this game and score a -7, putting is quite stupid as well. If you're after a simple game where anyone can drive 350+ yards, then this is for you. I'm sticking w/ 2001"
5,Best golf game out there !!!!,"The newest Tiger Woods golf game is pretty neat if you're not or you are into the cartoony type of games like HotShots. Although it's hard to get money as a character you create on the tour, you can a lot of money playing one on one games on the world tour to upgrade your player and equipment.The swinging of the club gets some getting used to and you can hit some bad shots if you dont concentrate on the left analog joystick. But once you get going you can earn money fast and even be good enough to place in the PGA tour as you can get money by being sponsered and placing in the top 30.I havent tried playing online yet but I would think it would be a doozey to play against people online.Definately a addicting and fun game."
5,"No frills, no problems","This is a basic, no nonsense string set that I've been using for years. I use these on a pair of 24-fret Ibanez RGs, both of which have a fairly low and loose setup. No durability issues; I regularly bend about 1.5 steps and generally replace strings because of wear and tear after a few weeks, rather than any instances of breakage.As for the buying process, I have ordered these several times from the various Amazon sellers and haven't had any problems. All the strings arrive in new condition, with no signs of improper storage, oxidation, or other damage. Usually I can get them in bulk from Amazon at a more affordable price point than I could from a showroom."
1,have to be older than 10 to use this toy,"The toy is a good idea, but it needs to be more user friendly, instructions are hard to follow, even for adults,maybe not quite so much activities at one time, could simplify some for younger players."
3,"So much potential, but not up to Smith standards!","I have read every Wilbur Smith book. I love his historical adventure focus. The other Courtney's of Africa novels are awesome. So too are the maritime novels and Eqypt series (except The Quest). But this one fails to live up to Smith's ability.Its a good book with a lot of potential, then you get to the last 100 pages, and its almost as if Smith must have gotten a call from his editor requesting the finished version 6 months early. Instead of bringing the book to a a fitting ending, he summerizes what happend and then ""the end"". Gone is the narrative style and your told what happens to everyone, without experiencing it through the story. Weak.Again, the book had so much potential, but was obviously hurried to conclusion. Do yourself a favor, and read almost any other Wilbur Smith book. Blue Horizon, River God, When the Lion Feeds, Seventh Scroll, the Courtneys of Africa series, etc. are great. Start there instead."
2,The American narrator loud and obnoxious ways ruin this documentary,"Great idea for a documentary; but the loud mouthed Cornell professor tried to make the documentary more about his feelings about Myanmar, instead of the rich story of the Myanma people.Very disappointing indeed.,"
1,what a disappointment,"i'll keep this short and sweet:this CD sucks.you might like if you're 12 and into really lame music, think you're cool, etc. but it sucks.their first CD was AMAZING. i have no idea what the hell happened, but this CD was a waste of my money.buy the first CD, it's emotional and beautiful and amazing. and then the band decided to jump on the punkrock train, and now they're just like everybody else.the lyrics are lame. they're just boring. and the vocals are obnoxious, i find his voice irritating. just... ew.don't. buy. this. CD."
5,I love ALL AHF CDs thus far!,"I just saw these guys play live (Feb 2005; opening band for Bowling for Soup in Burlington VT), and I can NOT believe that I had never heard them before. They rocked the place, and I bought all their CDs the very next day. Not only was their show great, but they even hung around afterward, to talk with fans and sign CDs, shirts, etc. Totally cool. My favorites on this particular CD are ""Art of Losing,"" ""Breakup Song,"" ""Nothing Left to Lose,"" ""The Gold Rush,"" and ""Built for Speed"" (when you have that many favorites off of one CD, you know it's a good one!). Their new CD ""Hearts on Parade"" will be released by Maverick in April 2005 - and I highly recommend that one too (based on a pre-release EP we bought at the show). And don't miss the chance to see them perform live if you can."
4,Back & Better,"After two years of waiting, American Hi-Fi are back with The Art Of Losing!!! The first thing you'll notice about this album comapared to the last is that this is much heavier but the riffs are better. The single, ""Art Of Nothing"" is definately a highlight along with track 2, 5 and theres def a great deal of others. Basically, if you loved their last album, your gonna love this more. They seem to have moved away from their mainstream look and just concentrated on good ol' fashioned ROCK!!!Great Album"
2,Not up to par,"As much as I appreciate and favor Kiri's voice, this particular recording is clearly not up to par. Poor production and technical work."
4,product description,Two girls rummaging through an old attic find a mysterious painting with musical significance that eventually helps them to find an emerald necklace and happiness for an old woman.
1,Just Awful,"The good reviews for this dreadful mess must have been written by the people who made it. A couple of breasts and a horrible soundtrack do not make for a good horror film. Aside from the twist towards the end, there is really nothing to recommend about this low-budget bore. Grey Damon (""The Secret Circle,"" ""True Blood"") is the only recognizable cast member here, and I'm sure he leaves this off of his resume. The ""slasher"" scenes are neither scary, clever or gory. Even the title makes no sense. Spend your money and your time on something else!"
5,FABULOUS,"This is their FINEST work ever....and not just for children, either!!!! I have all of their music - this is, by FAR, the most magnificent!!!"
5,Bobby B. MOUNT VERNON,"For a first attempt at writting I give the book a ""10"".five stars isn't enough. To the author ""Much Love "" and keep it real"
1,"""Nascar"" Thunder 2004, should be ""Joke Car""","I thougt this would be a cool game but I was WRONG!!!!!!I think racing in boxes would be much more fun and real then this. I got it and its so lame. Just touching someone makes them like -25 in rivals and later they slam their car into you and then you go like 80 yards into the sky, come down on your hood and you are still running good speeds. What a joke!!!!!!!!!The only thing good about this game is that Tony Stewart is on the cover."
2,"Rent, Don't Buy","My boys, 9 & 5, are huge Bionicle fans and asked for this game for Christmas. It is now Jan 9 and both of them have beaten it!!! The graphics are okay, nothing phenominal, and the kids seem to have had a good time playing it and say they will play it again. But where is the challenge when the 9yr old beats it in 2 days and a 5yr old can beat it in just a few more days??? Save your money on this overpriced day of entertainment and rent it instead."
4,good cooler,"This bag is okay. It is a little bigger than I planned, but it will do the trick. It fits all that one would need for a day. It is perfect for Dr. Brown's bottles."
2,"Doesn't fit ""standard"" bottles","I was excited when I found this cooler. I have twin boys, so I need double the bottles no matter where I go. Basically, long story short, when the desciption said it would fit ""standard"" bottles, I figured I was using the right type. Apparently, Avent bottles are not ""standard."" This cooler wants tall, skinny bottles, but unfortunately I (and everyone else I know) use short, stalky bottles. I think this product was designed a long time ago when tall, skinny bottles were popular. If you use Dr. Browns, I'm sure they would fit (although they might be too tall), BUT... if you use Avent, Tommie Tippy, etc... then look else where. I'm pretty disappointed. I will continue my search, I guess. On the up side, the price here is cheaper than Babies-R-Us."
4,It's alright...i thought it's what i need,"It's too heavy on the top and it'll tip over, i will search for another one...it does feel cheap in my opinion."
4,Breastflow Users,I got this to transport bottles back and forth to daycare. Since I am breastfeeding I am sending smaller quantities 2-4 oz which means more bottles. I am using the Breastflow 5 oz bottles and I can fit 5 in the carrier (4 standing up and 1 laying down across the top) and the included ice pack across the top. Looks like it is going to work great! The material is a little cheap on the inside - so I just plan on being careful with it. But for the price and the size - it is worth it as far as I am concerned.
4,Does its job!,"I like this bag. I can easily fit 6 Dr. brown 8oz bottles with travel caps in the bottom, and am able to fit accessories (including bottle nipple, screw cap, and insert) in the top portion. The only reason I gave 4 instead of 5 stars is because the lining seems cheap, like it will crack easily. Otherwise, great product."
1,It arrived leaking from the packaging.,I am not happy with this product. It was leaking all over my shipping envelope and still leaks. Not sure how sanitary it is if it leaks!! I ended up throwing it out.
1,Hrmm... not worth the money spent,"Only two good songs on the whole album, ""Legacy"" and ""Dropped the Hammer"". All the rest really carry no sort of rhythm at all, most of the songs sound like a car accident in progress."
2,Could have been good,"This was a good story, but I found the writing was a little bland with litle depth. I didn't bring me into the story like so many World War II personal stories do. I lost interest early on. I give the author kudos for writing this though and other people may very well enjoy it."
3,Two-edged sword,"Like so many of the other reviewers I love scent of this conditioner. When I use it my partner notices and buries her head in my hair. The ""conditioning"" leaves something to be desired though. My hair is very fine and curly. With this product my hair quickly turns fuzzy, wooly and unshiny.When I want amazing tresses I turn to a gel product by Grassroots. It doesn't smell like anything but it leaves my curls shiny, full and soft to the touch. I put up with the bad hair when my sense of scent is revved up."
2,decor point,"The cat scratch post shown in the illustration is a tasteful beige. Although the listing in Amazon said the item came in various colors, we were surprised when ours turned out to be a sort of brown flophouse tweed. It was also not round, as it appeared, but flat. It is nicely tall, as shown, which is the good news. We can't return it because we are picking up our new cat tomorrow and need something. But Amazon ought to leave some room for the customer to state a preference or request."
2,Lightweight,"This is an OK product. It is very lightweight, and doesn't have any weight in the base to hold it in place. This is ment to go under your couch corner, but will tip or fall if you have a high sofa/couch with large legs, or legs that are set close to the corners. We could not get it to stay in place, and had to move it to the middle of a lower piece of furniture...which kinda defeats the purpose, and the cats rarely use it."
3,cute but smallish,if you like small earrings these are cute. I prefer a larger earring and may give to my grandaughter. but cute earrings nothing wrong with them other than personal preference
5,Pretty earrings,"Loved these earrings, wanted a green pair, these have a little bit of blue in them, but that only makes them more beautiful and workable with different outfits. Good for dressy (office) and casual with jeans."
5,classic remniscent of vintage,These delicate little green beads have amazing depth and beauty they seem vintage and remind me of old world classic style. they are so pretty and eye catching. The person who received them loved them.
2,Spend your money elsewhere...,"A more concise and clear book from an author with solid credentials is ""Essential Eating"" by Janie Quinn. Quinn and Delinnart apply the same food theory of not eating certain food types together, but Quinn is more thorough in her explanations and provides numerous recipes and illustrations."
2,critical reviews are negative,Critical reviews on the book's science are often negative. So I tend not to want to write it up positively.
2,Borderline hack-work,"There are three different aspects in this book. Part of it is an argument that a technological human society previously existed and was wiped out something like 15,000 years ago. In this regard, the book borders on the absurd, not much better than the works by the ""aliens-built-the-pyramids"" crowd.The second aspect is the end-of-the-world fictional narrative. Just watch the movie ""The Day After Tomorrow."" I think it was inspired by this book.Lastly, there is a quasi-scientific attempt to explain how a rapid and drastic change in the global climate could occur. This would produce a global storm of biblical proportions that could usher in a new Ice Age. This would happen in a matter of months and not years (or decades).Mildly interesting but, keep in mind: neither of these authors has any real credentials. I don't have much confidence in the science behind the claims but it's not a complete waste of time, if you like end-of-the-world books."
4,While controversial . . .,"because of its scientific content as presented by non-scientists, I nevertheless found the book very informative and entertaining. It reads like a thriller but the subject matter is rooted in geological fact. The authors have managed to distill scientific data into a readable and enjoyable presentation of the onset of the next ice age. Other reviewers have been highly critical. However, I suggest one read the book less academically and more vernacularly. It's not intended to be a textbook, but an attention-getter."
5,What a Powerful Book,"I got this for Christmas. I never would have read anything by these guys, much less a book about the environment. But this is a GREAT book. Just fascinating. There are things in here about the past that I have never seen anywhere else. And it moves you, the story it tells. It's some kind of a classic. I just hope they aren't totally right, because if they are and we don't do anything about it, nobody will be left in the future to enjoy it. Thanks to two very unexpected authors."
1,The story is even boring..,"This book is fiction. The title makes it seem like there is some huge superstorm coming our way, but it is just the story of what it would be like if there was a pole shift and how it would affect the world. The story grabs your attention at first and is a bit scary in parts however quickly becomes very boring. I didn't even make it to the end of the book and I hardly ever don't finish a book."
1,Sorry Gang ... Art Bell is a sell out!,"This book is like Art Bell-- It sparks interest and the falls into boring rehitoric and self endulging doom and gloom that deserves to be in the budget bin. I am one of those who feel betrayed by Bell and his need to suck us of money like a vampire, and continues to give us schlock with no substance. These books are like his shows. He only shows up part time and still has the audacity to put his name on it. He is a sell out and I feel like I was robbed of my money. Well fool me once Mr. Bell (The Art of Talk) Fool me twice (the Quickening) and now you are out with this bathroom reader."
1,"Boy, this book blows. From an Art Bell Fan.","I am an avid listener of the Art Bell Program and was looking forward to reading it. BOY WAS I DISSAPOINTED! The writing is dry and sophmoric and lacks any originality or freshness. The plot is so unbelievable and unrealistic (regardless of Art's on air plugging) that you will quickly lose interest and pray for the ending to come. I read the book cover to cover hoping for it to get better but it never did. As a fan of the show I was sorley disappointed by this book. From all the on air plugging I thougt it would be a great read, but it wasn't. I WANT MY MONEY BACK!"
1,Global*&%^$**&,"All said and done, mother earth will eventually bury N.Y.C. under 2 miles of ice. Buy into carbon credits and taxes,to the tune of $Bill& $Trill. it still will, and the profitiers will have your $b $ $T to enjoy. Don't want to spoil there fun do you?"
1,Got to be kidding!,"Whitley Strieber??? Come on, abductions, implants, etc., this guy is a total JOKE! Now he is an expert on Global Warming? Holy Cow, the only one who is a bigger joke of a jackass is Al Gore, promoting this stupid book (and now an even dumber movie) as scientific fact."
1,Y2K??,"I haven't read the book, but another reviewer wrote something funny. He refered to Y2k and how people were worried about the end of the world then, and they were obviously wrong. (basically, making his point that the Superstorm idea is just as silly). Well, to that I would only say that Y2k could have easily caused major problems around the world if not for the hundreds of thousands of programmers working for years to solve the problem. So the only reason Y2K didn't ""end the world"" is because we worked to prevent it!! The same COULD be true for global warming if we don't prevent it. Many socially irresponsible people need a 6000 lb SUV to drive themselves to work. I guess they don't mind taking their chances that all the ""left-wing idiots"" are wrong. Personally, I wouldn't risk it."
3,I EXPECTED MORE....,"I am disappointed in The Global Superstorm. It is very hard to follow the story line and while reading it you wonder where Bell and Strieber are coming from. I find it very hard to keep my mind on the book. I love listening to Art Bell on the radio, just wish his book kept the reader as interested."
2,"Compelling, but it's still fiction, folks!","I just love this kind of stuff! It's so exciting to read all this information brought together to support a scenario, but then, it never really turns out the way the book said it would. Remember thirty-five years or so ago when African Genesis and Territorial Emperitive (I think the author's name was Robert Audrey) came out? It was a long time ago but the facts brought together were so compelling -- and over the next couple of decades it was repeatedly bashed with some saying it had been debunked. The problem with these kind of books is not to accept everything as accurate until some period of time has passed and the thesis played out a bit. Of course according to this book, many of us wouldn't be here any more! But Mr.Bell and Mr.Strieber have written a very, very interesting and readable book and I congratulate them hearily on their success."
5,First Aid for the OB/Gyn clerkship,This is great for MSIIIs starting their OB/Gyn Clerkship--it covers all of the high points of the field in a very clear format and prepares students well for their Shelf exam at the end of the rotation.
3,Lacking Multiplayer,"I was a little hesitant to buy this game. I wasn't sure how the Wiimote would work but the controls are actually fantastic. There are hundreds of levels, and even then the replay ability is great since you won't remember every level.The downfall of this game is the multiplayer option. You can have up to 8 people playing, but what's the point? The great part about the previous incarnations of this game (and games like it) is the the split screen versus. Without that, the game is seriously lacking. It's great if you enjoy playing alone, but if you are looking for a good multiplayer or versus option, this is not the game."
4,I trained under this man,"Having trained under Chris Thompson, I can say that the book is an accurate portrayal of good traditional wado ryu Karate. Washinkia karate is almost 100% wado ryu."
5,Arch book on the Good Shepherd,This Arch book is a wonderful explanation of the Good Shepherd parable for pre-schoolers to second graders.
5,loved it!!,"Another amazing book by Cookson. I love her dialogue and how she manages to take you into her story through her musical use of words. The story really shows you how not all we think we want is best for us and how the wonders and joys of life can manifest themselves in unexpected places. My only concern is that it seems to be a trend for Cookson for someone in her story to always end up with a cold that almost kills them. I know this happened quite often in the era during which the story takes place, but my goodness! Every story!!Other than that, I was not at all disappointed. <3"
5,HATS OFF TO MS. SENNA,"I read this fantastic book durning my holiday vacation from work. This was truly a treat. I usually do not find an interest in the bi-racial, poor white mother and her black kids drama. However, as a black women my need to support this young black women by purchasing her first novel won out over the lack of desire to read what I though would be another tragic mullatto story. But from the very begining I could not put this very well written work down. I related to a mother's love for her children and love of a man, for the unexplainable reason of just because. I looked at my daughter alot while reading this book because it made me remember, that she is an indiviual and her reality is a lot different from mine because she is coming of age, and I have been there. I was entertained and enlighten. Ms. Senna has written more than a book about being bi-racial. She has written a book about love."
4,A Heart-Stopping Book,"I think that this is a very good book because of two reasons: It is written well; the author portrays the character's actions, ideas and feelings in a way that makes them seem real, as well as a way that makes the story interesting, complicated and descriptive. The author makes you feel what the characters are feeling, and makes you feel different ways about different situations. That is to say, that the book has strong emotions in it, and they really reach out and grab you.This book is about two sisters who are very close, but who are treated differently because they look different - they are biracial and one of them looks more white, one of them looks more black. This is a heart-stopping story about a family and their journey through life. You are guaranteed to like this book - if you like intense books about family struggles!"
3,"Great looking, but not durable","My son absolutely loves this placemat. It has so many different varieties of animals and we enjoy talking about it at meal time. However, like other reviewers have noted, the color comes off. I have only ever used cold water and dish soap, but still the color is coming off. We also have the solar system placemat from the same company, and it is in great condition - I have no idea what the difference is!"
5,Magical Writing Explains the Witch Book of Saint San Gonzalo,"Wonderfully explains the tradition of Magical literacy in Salasaca, Ecuador. Explores the relationship traditional Salasacans have with literacy in weaving, witchcraft and writing. A solid and thought provoking reading experience."
2,This product smells good and feels rich and ...,"This product smells good and feels rich and creamy on my face. But it caused dry patches on my face and eyelids and I didn't feel reassured that it removed my makeup. Although I couldn't feel a residual film, I felt like I needed to apply a toner to thoroughly cleanse my face. People with sensitive to ultra sensitive skin, like me, probably wouldn't benefit from this product."
1,An agony to view,"Don't be fooled into thinking that because Morgan Freeman is in this film that it has any quality -- it does NOT. One of the worst films I've ever viewed. Kept waiting for something redeeming to happen -- never did. It's far from a ""gripping drama"" as advertised. Don't waste your money."
5,Morgan handles the role of Malcolm as well as every role he encounters!,"Literally follow Malcolm in his final steps that led up to the day of his death. He was respected of many and hated by a few - quite an interesting film and an accurate account of Malcolm's life. It will bring a sadness to watchers, but also leave a powerful impact of courage and realization of the fear that can stop forward movement in so many. Acting is superb by all in chosen roles."
3,"Below standards, or just ""been there done that""","Maybe I'm being a bit hard, but this stuff sounds like a zillion other remixes. None of these really grabbed me the way other Depeche remixes have in the past. The b-side on pt. 1, ""Better Days"" was the weakest b the boys have released in a while."
2,Why??,"ok, why would they make a hockey game like this. Sure the graphics,and music are good. And thats about it. And i know that we all like a hard hitting hockey game but this sucks. You cant skate 2 feet without being dropped, which really pisses you off. and the passing, its hard. And if you want to set up a one timer you cant, your guy will just skate on by it. And the controls are ok, but if you want to go a different direction you cant and youll just start going in a circle. Well the only thing left is i hope ea makes a better hockey game next year because getting hit in the head with a hammer is more fun than playing this game."
1,Disappointing,"I always wait for the EA NHL Series. How disappointing!!! The use of the analog stick makes it ackward and very hard. The defense on this is horrible. I will never out shoot the other team. The least EA could have done was to leave the player controls in the D-pad. They made this game very tiring and frustrating to play unlike the old games, which you didn't seem to be dominated every time even against weak teams.Better luck next year EA and get rid of the analog control."
3,NHL 2004,"As a whole, the game is great. The whole 9 yards of the game. The main problem that I have with the game is the scores of the game. The reason is the final scores of the games. 20-12, 17-16. I am sorry, that is not the hockey I know. Scoring is great, but were is the pressure of a 1-0 or 3-2 game. This is the main problem that I with the game. All other aspects of the game is great."
3,Realistic with some problems,"The game is extremely realistic. Dynasty mode is way past what I expected and it is nice to see the elite leages. Players finally play like they are expected to play. I like being able to switch stratiges without having to pause the game too. With those positive points, comes the cons. I found it extremely hard to control the players and puck. When I switch players I can direct him in the general direction that I want him to go but not completely control him. This is a disadvantage due to the control you need to enjoy the game."
2,Says everything that's in the book,"This was intended for a specific audience, of course. But still, it doesn't tell me anything that's not in the books, although it's a nice supplement."
4,good book with pros and cons.,"This book was my first book of this kind. And I was wondering about what's in the book before I bought it. I am a Ph.D. candidate who plan to graduate less than a year. Fortunately, my environment is good regarding the future planing after Ph.D.To me, most of ideas on the book were familiar concepts, my insitution, mentor, my thesis committee members, postdocs in my department are open to discuss about the issues described in the book. But! Still it was good to read through it and think about them again. I got some good points of view, and also I disagree with some apects of this book. I wish I could find more recent books that is concise and easy-to-read like this one. I have not found any comparable and inexpensive book yet."
5,"If your looking to be a professor, you need to read this","I got this book when I was trying to decide what to do after graduate school (I'm still in, but soon I'll be finished). This book and my experiences in graduate school really opened my eyes as to what a university professor really does and is expected to do. This book give a realistic account of what happens to assistant professors. This is one of the main factors that lead me away from that line of work. There are many little bits of information (that probabally have been learned the hard way) in this book that can really simplify your life if your looking for a science career. It isn't long and it doesn't matter how busy you think you are, if your going into the sciences your absolutely have to read this book. Some of what is in here, you'll already know, but trust me it is worth the short amount of time if takes to read it."
3,it is ok,"in my opinion, the views of this books are quite up-dated but not very special when it is compared with other books which talk about management it is good for those who don't know marketing and management but for marketing specialist, it is a summary of some views"
1,Not worth the money,"despite it is cheap, it does not give any value to an interested beginner of collecting old maps. ""Collecting Old Maps"" by Francis Manasek is a much better book and well worth the higher amount spent."
5,Reassuring and helpful,"If you are a college student majoring in television production, you know that internships are the only key to getting a career in the field. This book will be a vital asset to anyone fighting to secure an internship in the field of broadcasting.While many of the suggestions on actions one should take and how one should behave were things I found to be common sense, it was reassuring to read them being suggested in this book, not only by the authors but by the countless TV professionals that they quoted throughout the book.There were also several suggestions made that I wouldn't have thought of. I'm so glad that I read this book before I began my search for an internship. Now that I am in the middle of working as an intern for a local PBS station, I continue to find the book's suggestions helpful. I consult it every once in a while for new ideas."
3,It's OK but kind of wierd.,Mega Man X2 is an interesting and fun game once you get use to it. The bosses are much more difficult and need experience and ability to fight them. This was the first Mega Man I have played so it catches my attention. In X2 you would be better off if you beat X1 first to get the hang of the Mega Man X series. Not my favorite but not bad either.
5,great push toy!,my 9 month old loves this thing. he's just starting to stand and take a few steps and this toy is definitly helping. it sounds great too... kinda like a bicycle on the boardwalk!
5,12 month old LOVES this,"My son got this for his first birthday, and it was by far his favorite. I was worried about the noise, but it makes just enough noise to be interesting. If I had one complaint, it would be that it's hard to turn and he cries when he runs into something and stops. He loves it so much that he doesn't want to stop at all. We're going to take him to the walking track so he can just go straight and not have to worry about running into anything."
2,Too heavy for 18 month old,"This toy is nice looking and built with quality, but that is its downfall. A child cannot turn it easily when pushing or pulling it because there is no steering capability. This toy is probably more appropriate for a two or three year old. I would not recommend buying this toy unless your child was at least thirty pounds or if your child is two or older."
1,Dangerous! Poorly consrtucted.,"I was happy with this until the top bar came loose just a few days after we bought it! My 20 month old fell forward and landed with his neck on one of the vertical parts. It was terrible, and all because their glue didn't hold. If you buy this, please screw the top bar in place so this doesn't happen to you. This is not the only Melissa and Doug toy we have had glue issues with. Not recommended."
2,disappointing and unsafe,"I had been admiring this toy for so long and was thrilled to get it as a gift. When I took it out though, it seemed rather flimsy. Initially it went too fast for my son. He prefers a plastic one that we got as a hand-me-down. It surprises me because I think that this one is so much more fun. The big issue, and the reason why I have put it away, is that he was investigating the alligators and got his finger completely stuck in the place where the mouth of one of the aligators fits into the blue base. I am still not sure how he did it. I was unable to get it out and he was screaming. My husband ran to help and finally just yanked it out. It was very traumatic. In the end, his finger just was scraped and bruised, but I wouldn't want it to happen again."
4,not for thick carpet,"nice walker, but snags on our plush carpet. our child can still use it, it just moves slow and they have to rock it a little bit to move if forward. otherwise, nice"
1,Please be careful with this toy!,"i never put reviews on these things but my son was 13months old & went to push this toy, slipped & his face hit the handle........busted his lip & it required 5 stitches by a plastic surgeon. this toy is dangerous in my opinion. we threw it out immediately."
5,a must read.,very helpful and easy to understand.. anyone that would like to learn about anger or have an anger issue themselves should read this book...
4,"thomps7 on Stop Anger, Be Happy","Stop Anger, Be Happy is a great way to change your life. The author provides realistic and practical techniques for anger management. If one reads the book with an open mind it will allow one to learn about anger, one's self, and life.Stop Anger, Be Happy"
3,"Not quite a ""gold"" compilation, but not to be completely overlooked either","It's pleasing to see that the fairly recommendable Gold series has honoured Dusty with a 2CD set, but disappointing that they left off so many wonderful tracks (I assume it's a label licensing complication that wasn't worth major investment for a mid-price compilation set like this). The remastered quality is nice but not spectacular (I Close My Eyes and Count To Ten still has that very abrupt ending, The Look of Love isn't crystal clear, etc.) and the biography leaves out bits of her career (no discussion of her shelved album during her darker days and not much reflection upon Reputation or A Very Fine Love). It's not a terrible set, just terribly lacking in comparison to some of the Gold compilations for other artists that contain special bonus tracks or rarities. This would be fine as an introduction for a more casual fan or for collector's sake."
4,Good but not the best...,These have a very strong potato taste. I was also expecting them to be a little saltier than they really are. I would suggest trying them locally first before buying a case of them.
4,Full of fun and good music,"To overcome a British ban on pop music in the 50s and 60s, pirate radio stations were set up on ships anchored offshore to give the mainland a steady stream of rock. The most famous of these pirates was Radio Caroline, the inspiration for this film. One of the oddballs who make up this crew of disc jockeys is played by the inimitable Philip Seymour Hoffman. On shore, Kenneth Branagh plays Sir Alistair Dormandy, a member of Parliament determined to (literally) sink the pirates. Full of fun and good music, this one fits today's mood of protest of the common people."
2,The boat that rocked,"British government deems rock music as evil and places a ban, while a group of DJ's defy this ban by broadcasting music from a ship sailing in the North Sea. The movie alternates between the efforts of politicians to stop this broadcast and the lives of the individuals on this ship. I thought this movie was just plain. 2 stars. 12/19/10"
4,fun entertaining,"The movie is fun and entertaining, the music from that time period may have been the best creative period in Rock N Roll.Subject matter may not be for young audiences.Very fun"
3,Rock and Roll,Not many people new about Pirate Radio on this side of the pond. This is a great film about the stupidity of the BBC and the Brit government in the 60's. The film took too many liberties as to the real ending.
2,"Bad quality, high price","Quality was horrible and the price too high. Was extremely disappointing, especially after i saw the move in i-tunes with way better resolution and cheaper too. Not sure i'll be any movie from this website again."
1,bummer,"I should have known that not even this wonderful cast could save such a precious, cutesy, and glibly false script. Like most films set in this era, this one is drenched in self-indulgent nostalgia yet neglects to identify anything unique, interesting, or amusing about the times or the characters. These generic conflicts and characters could have been transplanted into just about any era and pretty much any situation: these ""wacky,"" ""carefree,"" ""quirky"" ""freedom-loving"" ""nonconformists"" might just as well have been frat rats, Hollywood types, soldiers, or college kids on spring break--nothing but stereotypes distinguishes them or links them to the Sixties. How awful to turn that decade into a slick, smug, commercialized cliche. I truly despise this film."
3,not what I expected,"I was led to believe this was a very funny movie, but it was so so. the music was great"
5,Love that it is so unaware of the statement it makes!,"I loved this movie. I wasn't really aware of this occurrence when rock music was outlawed in Britain. These enterprising pirates fought against censorship and stood up for freedom of expression, but I'm not really sure they knew they were doing all that at the time. I think they were just playing some tunes. The movie was funny and heartwarming with a great cast. Love it!"
1,Rip Off Version - Buyer Beware!,"I'm Pi$$ed off coz I like this book but my friend's copy (which came out the printing b/f this one) has the exact same cover, etc. but has a section filled w/ Color Renditions off all the pulp covers! THIS RIP OFF version has those pages in Lame B&W and is even MORE EXPENSIVE! What the hell? Refund me."
4,Bring on the orchids and island breezes....,"A moment of whimsy led to a very satisfying buy when I purchased this recording. Although the sound quality is a bit uneven, it is a very enjoyable collection of real Thai music of the sort you could expect to hear in villages and temples. It is not overly complex, and is a welcome alternative to more formal, atonal ceremonial Southeast Asian music. Thankfully, no electronic sound wizardry has been attempted to fancy-up the purity and charm of these native songs and instruments. I highly recommend it."
4,Bad Wizard - 'Sky High' (Howler Records) 4 1/2 stars,"Forgot I even had this Bad Wizards CD. Personally, I've always liked this band from Athens, Georgia. Some patrons have unintentionally tagged them as stoner rock - but I think they're more in the heavy metal vein. Tunes here that honestly had me play this disc several times in one day - in part because the CD's duration is only 35 minutes are ""He's A Rat"", the rocking ""Jealous Man"", ""Black Navigator"", ""Strawberry"" (sort of maybe reminds me of Motorhead - well, the playing anyway) and the total ass-kicking ""Pass It On"". I'm guessing their major influences are Black Sabbath, MC 5 and AC/DC. Old school fans of such should get a lot out of this title."
5,Five Lessons: The Modern Fundamentals of Golf,This is the greatest book ever written concerning the golf swing. Everything else is a distant second. Some concepts are difficult to understand but once you get it your golf game will change forever.
5,Hogan tells you HOW!,"I have worn out four copies of this book and given many as gifts. If you want to play golf well, you must swing the clubs well. Hogan tells, AND shows you how, starting with the proper grip. Bring this book with you to the practice tee and make reference to it when you are having problems with your swing."
5,Fundamentals you need,"Some people don't like this book, I just don't understand why!If you look at any other books or video tutorials on golf fundamentals, you will see they cover the exact same information as in this book. This book is thorough and comprehensive. The instructions are clear and the illustrations are great, in my opinion.You'd think a book originally printed in 1957 would be outdated. However, this book shows you that the fundamentals of today's golf are the same as 1957's golf.Great way to improve your game and understanding your grip, address and ball positions, and most importantly, your swing."
4,good book,"it is a good book, doesnt have pictures, but the draws are ok, ben hogan is a wonderful teacher"
2,Its time has passed,"This book is one of the classic golf instructional books. There are numerous books out today that do a much better job of teaching the golf swing.If you want to buy this book because it is a classic, then by all means buy it. If you are new to golf and looking for your first book to help you learn the golf swing, look elsewhere."
5,Classic,"5 lessons deserves 5 stars. Very clear in writing and illustrations. To show you how good it is, I let my neighbor borrow it and have not seen it in 10 months. A must have for all levels, from the casual to the avid golfer. Just don't let your neighbor borrow it. :)"
5,A Great Guide,"Just starting and have nagging questions in the back of your mind? Is my grip right, what about my stance, is my swing plane correct? This book cuts to the chase back to the basics and practicing as prescribed I find it easy to remember the lessons. While it will not make you a tour pro it will help you get started."
3,Some stupid reviewers,"This movie is fine for what it is. Leave it alone. Venom was better because it was coming from a more serious angle but if you want some good gory special effects then this movie is the one. Sometimes you feel for chicken sometimes for steak. Get over it. The movie is fine for what it is. Not expecting ""The Pianist"" here."
2,This is a spoof of a movie genre that is already a spoof of itself,"Granted, Hatchet has quite a few unnecessary topless female scenes, making it a perfect replicate of most classic slasher films, but the value of this film pretty much stops there. I find it surprising that investors were willing to put up money for the making of Hatchet since it is meant to be the epitome of a slasher film and therefore a spoof of the genre, however the genre itself is generally a spoof of itself, making Hatchet become just another redundant slasher film. A group of people wander into the woods and get chopped up by a mysterious being one-by-one until no one is left. Been there, done that."
2,"Not good at all, really...","Do yourself a favor and rent this instead of buying it. You will not want to watch it more than once, as it is not really good at all. The characters are annoying. The situations are annoying. The dialog is annoying. The action is annoying. There is nothing about this movie that I can honestly say that I liked.You are supposed to want the main characters (good guys) to win in horror movies. You are supposed to want them to win, or at least live, because they have been portrayed as someone you can relate to or would like in real life; you are supposed to feel empathy. I felt nothing but disdain for every character in this movie and just wanted them all to die. You will feel the same way."
1,"Horrible , I could eat some taco bell and BK and dump out a better script.","Horrible Special effects,No endingHorrible actors.WHAT A JOKE, THANK GOD I DIDNT BUY IT OR I WOULD SUE TO GET MY MONEY BACK!!!"
2,Hatchet has a lousy swing,"Hatchet producers got one thing right: put plenty of female nudity into a horror film. Check. Other than that, the film flops on every level. Badly written, horrible art production, an ineffective idea to make a horror film a comedy...it's not the kind of classic old school horror film I grew up loving. I need a heart stopping scary character, girl-next-door female B-actresses who take their clothes off, good dialogue, and at least a decent set of movie-making skills to make the production watchable and enjoyable. This film didn't have 9 out of 10 of the required elements."
2,"Gory slasher flick, wastes a decent cast","This film takes place in New Orleans around mardi gras time... an assortment of folks end up on a swamp tour of death, entering the domain of ""hatchet,"" a deformed killer who will ruthlessly slash and dismember his victims. The cast do a decent job within what they had to work with in this gory, unoriginal tale. The film is relatively short and the plot is focused in the 2nd half on who can escape the swamp before being grotesquely slain by the killer. There isn't really that much in the way of surprises or clever dialogue except for a few spots such as when a few of the characters are revealed as having been less than honest about themselves. Thus, if you like bloody horror films then you may enjoy this, but otherwise you'll probably want to pass on it."
2,quilt,I have been following this particular artist since she first published her first quilt book. I enjoyed her other books and is a bit disappointed with this latest addition to her repertoire.
3,Just what it says it is,This is just what it says it is. I wouldn't trust it loose in my purse but for a stationery product it is great.
2,Caps pop open too easily,"The compartments are very large, more than I needed, but would be a good size for someone taking more than 2-3 supplements. Unfortunately, the lids really do pop off too easily. I read the reviews of people who weren't happy about that, and I thought it wouldn't be a big deal since I wasn't using it to travel, just to organize. But they pop open even just being lightly bumped or brushed. If I dropped it I have no doubt every single lid would come flying open. I ended up buying a smaller and more secure one that could still hold a few supplements per compartment."
1,Who designed this mess?,"This is such a bad design that it should be studied in design departments as an example of how not to solve a problem. The problem is that the labels on the compartments are upside down in relation to each other. In other words, if you are looking at it with the row of PM compartments facing you, the PM labels are right side up and all the AM labels are upside down. If you turn it around the other way, the AM labels are right side up, but then the days are in the wrong direction, going from right to left. I find this bizarre. It's visually disturbing to someone with any sense of symmetry and order. The only thing I could do was to cover up all the labels, AM and PM, with duct tape, and write the days and the AM/PM notations on the duct tape. So now the AM compartments are on top, where they should be, and the PM compartments are on the bottom, going from left to right, and the words are all right side up. Dumbest design I've ever seen."
1,Broke when received,"We did read that there were some problems with the lids on this item, but we went ahead and ordered it anyway. However, we were very surprised when right out of the box 3 of the lids were broken on one pill case. We did not even open the other 3 that we purchased and returned all back for a refund. This product should be removed from the items you sell. It is of very inferior quality."
5,Does What it Needs,"Exactly as said, does what it needs and you can remove both covers for quick refilling. I use this for all the vitamins I take, so I don't particularly take it in any order. Just makes things easy."
5,"A ""Must Have""",This is great for the trail or anywhere. Worth the money. Very durable. The heck with those pump systems. I was skeptical about this till I heard the Army uses them. I checked it out and it works. This is great deal for the price.
1,Does not work with rechargeable batteries,"The unit I received does not work as advertised with rechargeable batteries. Tried 4 sets of strong NiMH batteries with the same result: fluorescent tube flashes once then LED indicates battery error. Called company. The device requires 750mA constant current with a peak of possibly 900mA on bulb warm-up. HydroPhoto's claim of 200 uses on NiMH can not be typical. (You can do the math.) In my experience one use on rechargeables was not possible. I also suspect the reported numbers using Lithium batteries. It probably works fine (though I could not verify), but I'm not planning on buying lots of throw away batteries."
4,cd review,"This double disc is rare in the U.S. and the quality was good, my only complaint being that the last track of the first disc was scratched and would not transfer onto my computer. Otherwise I would be very satisfied."
3,It's okay,"My disappointment with this product was that the minute you start to loosen the knob, the adapter immediately collapes and you jump to save your flash and umbrella from crashing into the stand or onto the floor. I have other ones that have a ""positive lock"" type of mechanism built into them, kind of like a gear, so that when you loosen it, you have to press against it to adjust the angle of the flash... much safer, they don't just come flopping down instantly with the weight of the flash and umbrella.. I kept it as a back up to all my other ones, but I can tell you I've not ever used it yet since the first flop! It broke my flash right off my wireless trigger! Yikes... okay for backup I suppose, but I'll stick with my other ones!"
5,Works great but pricey,"This umbrella bracket works great but is a little pricey. But if you are into photography you are used to things being a little pricey. I use this with my westcott 60"" convertible umbrella and 28"" Apollo softbox and it works great."
1,GIVE ME A BREAK !,"Robert Mitchum was a good actor,but,as this album so abundantly proves,he was not a good singer...Now,don't get me wrong here,if some fan of a good actor wants other memorabilia by him/her that is thier right,but being of fan(even a really loyal fan)still does not mean that the actor or actress in question can pass muster as a vocalist...It really doesn't take too much effort to ""sing""the sort of calypso tunes that take up a lot of the space on this disc...Mitchum can get by,but then so can I,probably so can you as well...But,honestly,neither one of us is the next Harry Belafonte,and,during his lifetime,neither was mitchum...Therefore,like most other celebrity ""golden throat""vanity releases,Mitchum's two albums exist not because Bob Mitchum was such a great vocalist but,instead,because Bob Mitchum was a popular actor,wanted to sing,and his star status permitted him to record..many really talented vocalists should be so fortunate..."
5,Covenant not contract,"I went to our local Christian bookstore looking for something to give me insight into a difficult area of our relationship. My marriage was going thru a tough time and I needed some reading that I could think about without having to dig for the meaning. I truely believe that God sent me to ""The Blessed Marriage"" by Robert and Debbie Morris. This book was exactly what I needed and God ministered to my heart through it. It has changed my heart and my thinking dramatically and I daily choose to be the covenant keeper. A wonderful wonderful book that is well written. A message of hope and biblical truth."
5,Eye Opener,My husband and I are newlyweds who recently started reading and applying the basics of this book... What an EYE OPENER it is for us! It is truly helping us to relate and understand each other and the principles of marriage in a more clear way.
3,"This Slim Fast bar is filling, even though ...","This Slim Fast bar is filling, even though it's little. When eating it, wait for awhile and you'll notice that you're no longer hungry. It's very convenient to tuck one in your pocket for a nutritious lunch on the go -- instead of fast food. It's a little dry and you don't really notice the raisins (chopped very fine), but it's quite tasty. I have tried the chocolate-flavored ones in the past and prefer them, but this flavor gives me some variety. I would buy these again and would recommend them to anyone wanting to watch their weight or have an easy alternative to fast food."
5,Magnificent Music!,"This is 1 of the best albums I have ever listened! Such a rich mixture of rock, blues and jazz I've never heard in my life! What a span! J.Hendrix, Clapton or Miles Davis could not do better !"
4,Met expectations,"These arrived on time and in good condition. They work well in dry areas on the skin. In any area that is moist, they let go and fall off. I augmented their attachment with a liquid bandage product. I put the liquid bandage on then the steri strip then some liquid bandage. I did not let the liquid bandage get too close to the wound and you have to be careful if the skin is thin or sensitive to the liquid bandage, if it is then just use the steri strips by them selves. Additionally, watch that tape from any bandaging doesn't get on the steri strip or when you change the bandage it is likely you will pull the steri strip(s) off as well."
2,Not designed like the original,"I have an original Rubbermaid spatula 9.5 inches long with wooden handle that I love; but, unfortunately, it is wearing out. I have looked in various stores at other brands, but they don't have the thin edge like my Rubbermaid spatula. I found the commercial Rubbermaid one on Amazon and decided to try--wasted my money. The edge on the commercial one is twice as thick as my original Rubbermaid. It is impossible to determine that fact in the photos. I am very disappointed Rubbermaid has discontinued making a quality product that I used and replaced for years."
1,Unfinished Business,"My ""used"" Cap Barbell Xodus VKR Chin-Dip stand came without instructions and without the chin-up bar. BUYER BEWARE of used items from this vendor. I sent an email two weeks ago asking them to send instruction and the chin-up bar with no response. They must be busy laughing at all the folks who buy used equipment from them. NEVER AGAIN. These guys suck."
1,Not good if you really have serious thumb problems,I am not happy with this product. It is flimsy and doesn't support the thumb at all. It doesn't wrap around right and barely covers the thumb.
3,its ok,"im an in between size so i got the med. its kind of big in the thumb & small in the wrist, so it kind of doesnt fit & bunches but it will have too do i guess.thanks"
4,The brace helps.,The product was delivered in a timely manner. I have arthritis in my thumb and this brace helps.
2,Committe Jokes OK,"I got this book expecting humerous explanations of Presbyterian philosophy. It has a lot of cute jokes, but has very little food for thought in terms of Christian or philisophical content. I reccomend this for the Presbyterian committee member with a sense of humor. It's also a mildly good joke gift for a church leader. I wouldn't particularly reccomend buying it for your Sunday school class, though."
4,In response to V. Tom's review,"My own experience with Nizoral is that the first time you use it (after not using it for a while or not using it ever before), you WILL get an increase in flakes. It's almost as if it's loosening up and ridding your scalp of everything that was already there. After that, with continued use, it's amazing. I find that only after using it two or three times, I can stop... sometimes for weeks, sometimes for months, without reacurring dandruff! So don't be scared after the first shampoo and all these huge flakes show up. I do wish it smelled a little nicer, but it's a small price to pay for results!"
1,Seriously Overpriced,"This exact same item sells for less that $7.00 at every other website and store on the planet. This site has priced this item too high, also this site has no contact information listed. Not a safe place to buy from."
2,Kiss (Vague) Guide to Playing Guitar,"I started playing guitar last year; I bought this book as opposed to the ""...for Dummies"" series of instrument teaching. At first it was a decent book to learn guitar through, but once you get further into the book, it strays from the focal point of you learning all aspects of playing. After awhile, it only gives you chord diagrams, and there is very little about up/downstroke technique, the fingerpicking lessons are EXTREMELY obscure, and there's at least 30 pages total throughout the book dedicated to just pointless history of the guitar and guitar players.I picked up a bass last month and this time bought ""Bass Guitar for Dummies"" and I picked up on bass much faster learning through this book than learning guitar with the other book (and alot of the scale positioning in that book helped me learn more about guitar than the KISS guitar book did). Do not buy this book if you are trying to learn guitar, there are better books out there to learn from."
1,NOT VERY GOOD,"i bought this book because I liked how it had pictures and not drawings, but It was a mistake. almost half the book is just about history. it spends almost no time teaching you how to play chords and read music. it covers alot of subjects, but they're all incomplete. you should go with Guitar for Dummies."
4,KISS Guitar review,"I read part of this book at the library and decided to purchase the book with the CD. About 1/3 of the book is discussing the history of rock guitar and types of electric guitars, etc.The Middle 1/3 of the book gets into different chords and strumming exercises,how to play blues with different finger exercises for hammering, etc.The last 1/3 of book talks about how to record your music. The book was printed in 2000. So some of the equipment discussed in this section is outdated with the new products on the market.I am just starting to play an electric guitar as I hadn't played my accoustical guitar for several years and decided to get back into playing music again.I bought a 2008 Gretsch electromatic guitar and a fender vibro champ xd amp that has 16 different voices so between the two I make my own funky blue sound. The amp has a combination of digital and tubes which gives one sounding notes, etc."
5,Excellent multimeter,"As a test, I measured things whose values I knew precisely, and found the meter to be right on. Everything works as advertised. A good value."
2,Pins NOT included,Slightly chincy rubber.... seems more plastic...... but the big problem is that there are supposed to have the spring pins included and IT DOESN'T. not good.
2,Not worth it!,"For editing this program is great. User friendly interface, etc. After that...Try getting help. The manual is absolutely terrible. The whole point in buying this program was to make a few VCD's. The manual says about 3 words on this subject. It does not even talk about some of the most important aspects of the program. It was obviously not written for the beginner. Website help? Forget it. Worse then the manual. Phone help? The toll free # listed gets you to the secretary. She's in charge of giving you the 900#.Don't waste your money or time (I sure did!)"
1,Beware this Vendor...,"Due to a problem with the order, it was never received (but paid for!). I contacted the vendor in good faith to resolve this manner and get my order. To date, they have failed resolve this and have since proven unconcerned, unhelpful and downright unwilling to help fix the problem. Bottom line: I paid good money for my merchandise and never got it! My advice: Buy from this vendor at your own peril. Beware this vendor!"
5,Covers everything you'd want to know,"Who'd ever think I'd be buying a book called Growing Old, but when you need it, you need it. It helped my dad. And it's complete."
3,good book,This book is ok but I bought it for my toddler so its still a little long for her attention span right now. I wish they also had one with a girl instead of a boy as the main character. But still a good read
1,It stretches... Then tears...,"Over time the strap stretches, so that the outer part of the bracelet becomes wide enough to trap, for example, the material around your trouser pockets. Not a terrible tragedy - until it starts to fray the material which has so far ruined 2 pairs of trousers..."
2,BACK MATS NOT INCLUDED,"I am very pleased with the front floor mats, however I am EXTREMELY disappointed that I did not receive floor mats for the back seat. They are shown in the pictures and listed in the product description. Feel like I was a victim of false advertising. Buyer beware!"
4,Pretty Good,"Easy to read and understand. The tips in the book are pretty good, but I didn't really use many of them because they didn't really seem to help me. The guidelines on citations are by far one of the best things in this book."
3,Once upon a midnight dreary...,"Dreary. That's the word that sprung to mind while reading this book. The world view and characters in this book really are very dark, and I found it a bit hard to read. Rankin's main character, Rebus, is about the unhappiest protagonist I've run across in mystery fiction.By a strange coincidence, I happen to also be reading books by Peter Robinson, whose main character, Alan Banks is ALSO going through marital problems and career burnout. And yet somehow Banks is appealing, while Rebus is not.I believe I would have rated Rankin's book higher, as it is a competent police procedural, if it weren't for the fact that it suffers in comparison to the Robinson books, which in so many ways are similar yet pull off the whole ""world weary, burned out cop"" thing so much better."
3,Interesting introduction to the series.,"Lacks the complex, inter-twining plot and characters of his excellent later novels. The plot is a little run of the mill and the resolution predictable.It does fill in a lot of details about JR's past."
3,A little dry,"I didn't always want to pick it up and continue reading, although I did make it through. Not a page turner by any means, but not the worst mystery I've read either."
1,Couldn't get through it,"I would give it zero stars but 1 is the minimum.I was horrified and sickened by the unnnecessary descriptions of the murders, and could not make it past the first third of the book.I felt no empathy with the main character Rebus.I won't be reading any more by this author."
4,A-Plus,Linda Howard gives us one of the better reading experiences. Romance lovers will find her a delight. Also highly recommend No Illusions by Cassandra Ormand
2,Wish we could be warned about reprints!,I eagerly await new books by Linda Howard and used the pre-ordering facility by amazon to purchase this. I was very disappointed to discover that I had already read this compilation of three stories. I love this author but these stories were too short to really grab you.
4,Three reprinted novellas - 2 are good reads,"I'm not a fan of novellas because they're usually too short for my taste. And I was glad that I knew this was 3 reprinted stories compiled into one larger read - so I didn't pay to reread something I'd read before. The third novella, White Out, was pretty good and I understood why it was better published as a short. The second one, Blue Moon, was my favorite of the three and made me wish she'd written a larger story around these two characters. Lake of Dreams was okay, but I'm not big on paranormal stories, particularly when it's a central part of the plot. Lake of Dreams may have been better if it was expanded into a regular sized book."
1,Do not buy this,When you lift the pulleys up without weight on them (to get them out of the way while your bike is down) and then try to lower them later--they will not come down under their own weight. You must get a ladder and pull them down by hand. BAD! Also the safety mechanism is frustrating.
1,Horrible Product,"Do not buy this bike hoist. The pulleys do not travel downwards when no weight is on them. This is very important for a bike hoist because when you are riding your bike, the pulleys are brought up to the ceiling so they are out of the way--then when you get back from the ride, you must lower the pulleys down to bike-height in order to lift the bike up.I have tried almost all bike hoists on the market. The Racor is the cheapest at $21 and it works fine, but feels and looks budget. The Kettler Spezi is around $50 but it feels good, works smoothly, and has the best locking mechanism. If you must have quality, buy the Kettler."
2,Not a peferct fit,Not able to dock Zune with cover on. Too much of a pain to removing when playing on speakers and putting it back on when mobile ... not worth it.
3,A fun book to read,I enjoyed reading this book. Most of the stories were interesting and the character development was done fairly well. I was disappointed in the second story (about Shamur & Tazi) because the story seemed to have no real purpose. The story of Cale was my favorite (I can't wait to read Shadow's Witness). Hopefully more history of his life in Westgate will come out.If you are a fan of the FR you won't be disappointed in this book. It will be interesting to see how many spin-offs this book produces.
3,Inspiring Writings from the Early Church,"This is a nice little collection of some writings from some of the early church ""fathers."" The writings have a freshness of faith to them and are very inspirational. My only complaints are that there was not MORE of the writings from each author and a detailed Bibliography would have been nice to track these writings down for some extended reading. I was left wanting more."
5,"As always, Sammy is delicious!","Robin Hardy's Sammy is as irresistible as always in his newest adventure, ""Working for a Living."" He's constantly in trouble, with only his wits and his guts and his charisma to get him out and, of course, his faith and his intrepid wife, Marni, to back him up. As a lifelong Dallas area resident, it's always fun for me to ""recognize"" the locations in a book. Even the merciless Dallas heat rings true in ""Working for a Living."" It's an A-Number One summer read! I can't wait for more books in the series."
4,Good Fat-Free Cookbook,"This is a good cook book for people who are wanting to cut their fat intake. I bought this book in 1997, and after using the recipes in this book, along with some other low-fat cookbooks that I had at the time, I managed to lose a decent amount of weight and get healthier. The recipes are good, my kids even liked them. Some of the nice features in this book are that each recipe has a shopping list at the bottom of the page, it includes diabetic exchanges, and the book even includes a 14-day menu plan. I used that plan for the times when I was trying something new and wasn't quite sure what I should serve with it. All in all, I'm happy with it, and I still use many of the recipes in this book 7 years later."
2,Has not worked the way I wanted once.,"Couple quick gripes.1. The dropdown legs barely come up in the ""up position"". Seriously, it's around a quarter of an inch off the ground. That's a problem because if there is any elevation the pegs get stuck (hope the camera was on there tight;). Oh, and they don't come off. They are bolted in there with no way to take them off. Why would they do that?2. Do not try to film and move with this thing. I've seen where people have put sand bags and all sorts of crap on similar things to reduce vibration, but nothing is working for me.So, take it for what it is. It might just be me. I might not be using correctly. Either way, those two problems keep this thing in company storage."
4,A neat book on WW1 flying.,"Wow, go back to a different time when aeroplanes were covered in cloth and the navigation instruments are mostly landmarks.This is mostly a monolog of what it was like to live and fly in a much simpler time. a good read if you like aircraft or WW1 history."
1,Definatly not again,This shoe was terrible! I wore these shoes a maximum of 4 times in a week...First the plastic on top came apart from the platform also now the rubber is falling off the bottom of the shoe..I would think this being a dancing shoe that it would be able to withstand a little more than a week?? And i go easy on my shoes.Wouldn't recommend this brand to anyone!!
3,green shoots of bamboo,"The judge paced hell, the hell-ways, and his robe left him, skimmed away like singing sheep. Lifted. ""So that's how it is,"" the judge said. ""I thought you had my back."" Another judge gathered near, a woman with a body like an open oven door. ""My robe left me, too,"" she said. ""You learn a lot about yourself, your friends, when you burn eternally in fire.""Several Hell-Monitors showed up and taught a class on under-tipping, and also Wal-Mart, how to not notice when you are clearly in the way of another shopper.The judges made love. I mean they gathered a thousand birds and glued them to Zoloft and then sprinkled the whole thing with the tears of Jennifer L. Knox.Jennifer L. Knox is my sister.Look, a crystal gavel, the way it fuzzes the energy from the peach. The centigrade 2 cents, the gold, gold fish."
4,Best Crystal Gavel on Market (yes there are others),I had to ship my Platinum Gavel back to myself when I could not take it on an airplane. Never again will I find myself gavelless and unable to render snap judicial rulings just because I'm traveling. On a side note my wife has her own now because she says it muddles the lime and mint perfectly for mojitos.
3,"Is Good, Pretty, No Good For House","Its a good gavel, thank you for reading my review, it is a prudent gavel, jurisprudent gavel, you can not use it on house it is for legal matters for example, thank you godinger for finally building an affordble affordable crystal gavel my friends my family less than only $20."
5,A GAVEL TO END US ALL,I CANNOT CONTAIN MY EXCITEMENT FOR THIS GAVELSERIOUSLY!A CRYSTAL GAVEL!CAN I PLEASE HAVE THE PREVIOUS 24 YEARS OF MY LIFE BACKTHE YEARS BEFORE THE CRYSTAL GAVEL!THOSE YEARS MEAN NOTHING TO ME!THOSE YEARS ARE SLEEP YEARS IN WHICH MY DREAMS MEANT NOTHING!I WOULD LICK THE FEET OF ANY JUDGE THAT SENT ME TO JAIL WITH THAT THANG!
1,Good historical fiction on the industrial age,Life on the mean streets of Gilded Age. The author made good use of historical facts and characters but the story tended to veer off into self introspection after the first half. The ending was a guest who dropped by and left without having said or done anything.
1,Wasted one and a half hour of my life...,"I have never seen a film so slow and stupid. I have seen many horror films in my life, both slow and annoying. But this film, has a habit of dragging all of the suspense way beyond the point of excitement. It's like...it builds up just enough for you to think, ""Ok...so it's about an alien...now what?"" Then, all you get is bits and pieces of quick shots. Maybe one extended alien shot, but that's about it. The rest is just people running around in a supermarket. Cat-and-mouse film. Stupid."
1,Horrible! Wish I could get a Refund,"Don't waste your time or money! I wish I could get my $2.99 back from Amazon on this one. I stopped watching after 45 minutes. It started good, then got very slow, bad acting, film work and effects. It felt like a cable TV show (that might be on the USA network or TBS) but was not worth any time."
4,Alien Raiders review,"When looking for films, I want something that will provide entertainment. This film did that. It had a few bits of gore, horror, suspense and was inintentionally funny in a few spots, then, perhaps I just have a warped sense of humour. As with all other films of this genre, it is not for everyone. Some people may want something ""darker"". The ending was unexpected but I won't spoil it for others. I found it a little thought provoking, but it did not give me nightmares."
3,Not read able,"I have used Verbatim for most of my DVD recordings, for some reason this batch of discs will not work on my DVD recorder like they use to. I had to go buy some Sony DVD-r discs to finish the job."
2,Skip from B to D,"I think this was written because Ms. Grafton's Publisher was pushing her to get the next one out. It's really boring! But don't give up! ""D is for Deadbeat"" is packed with excitement! Since the next book doesn't depend on anything in this book, I'd just skip this one and go straight from ""B is for Burgular"" to ""D is for Deadbeat""!"
5,Book purchase,"The book I ordered was received in ""Like New"" condition as promised. I am completely satisfied."
4,Kinsey is back to solve another crime,Kinsey is back and this time she is asked by a young man Bobby Callahan to help him figure out who might want him dead. Kinsey agrees to take the case and she figures it should not be that hard and not to much work for her.As time goes on and Bobby is found dead. Kinsey starts to stumble across some evidence that might point towards who might have wanted Bobby dead and why they wanted him dead.Sue Grafton has knack for writing and hook me on the first book. I enjoy her writing style and am always looking forward to reading more books about Kinsey's adventures and how she figure them out.This was another great book in the series.
3,The one that got me started,"3.5 stars (4 and above stars being - usually - reserved for the really great/unique books).This is the first Kinsey I ever read, and initiated my interest in the Kinsey plots. The series is one helluva 'tell-it-like-it-is', Kinsey is a lovely character, and the mood is always comic-sombre (a bit down but never out - even while winning! noir style?). You can enjoy every book in the series - come rain or come sunshine."
4,C is for Corpse by Sue Grafton,Such an easy read and well written. I like the fact that it is part of a series and will buy the rest of the books.
3,HUH?,"This is entertaining, but without spoiling it for someone who hasn't read it yet, I have to say a key plot point at the end makes no sense at all."
1,disappointing,"I bought this book thinking, for some reason, that it was about alternative birthing (gentle, natural, low-technology). It turns out that it's as mainstream as it can be. It tells you all the nonsense that doctors do to you in the hospital, and tries to justify it. The last thing we need is another book promoting unnecessary interventions."
4,I'm the type of guy who's always on ...,I'm the type of guy who's always on the run. Twenty minutes after eating the bar I was hungry again. Not the right product for someone active who's looking for a meal replacement.
3,The more depressing side of pinback....,"I hate this album, because it is not an album.An album flows from one track to another.This is a mash of some of the best, most obscure pinback songs.Specifically, Messenger, Anti-hu, and Byzantine are three of the most amazing obscure songs Pinback has ever created. The fact that they are put on the same cd as Avignon and Clemenceau bothers me, as it gives the entire cd a sad feel. Clemenceau is the most depressing Pinback song ever created, and it acts as a black hole for the adjacent tracks, sucking dry any residual positive energy left by byzantine or messenger's catchy rhythms.Then again, it is pinback, and they are brilliant.And I suppose they need at least one downer album to show they can run the gamut of emotions from unhappy to melancholy."
2,"Not worth it-- get ""Worms Eat My Garbage"" instead-","Mary Appelhof's book is the superior introduction to vermiculture. Both books are too cutsey in tone, and the illustrations are equally unbearable, but typos abound in ""Recycle"", and that really burns my butter. While there are some unique ideas in this book (using sprouted birdseed to aid in aration is one), there is little else in here not covered by Appelhof. Appelhof's book is vastly more readable, despite the sometimes condescending tone she takes. I can't recommend ""Recycle"" unless you want to own as many books on vermiculture as you can get your hands on."
1,It's cheap for a reason.,"The price is right on this KVM switch, but that's where it ends. If you switch back and forth between two running PCs and at least one is running WinXP, it won't find the mouse when you return to the WinXP machine. DLink support suggests using a non-scrollwheel mouse (which is a poor fix), but even then, with a standard two-button PS2 mouse, it still won't activate the mouse once you move away from the WinXP box and then return.Look elsewhere for a KVM switch."
5,A Little Cumbersome but Versatile,Brightly colored. Matches my PWC. A little too long and cumbersome with so many keys. You can cut the un-used keys off. They made the loop too big. I prefer to just clip it to my life jacket than attach another wrist band. Floats well. Whistle is loud and clear. Well priced as an aftermarket product. You can buy a few of these over the cost of a factory key.
4,Equinox ~ Styx,"This is a good album, the best album of Styx until Crystal Ball. The album starts with some songs that are ok, but not great. These songs are: Light Up, Lorelei and Mother Dear. After these songs it's time for the real gems! See how i rate the songs, and you will see what I mean:1. Light Up(7/10)2. Lorelei(7/10)3. Mother Dear(7/10)4. Lonely Child(9/10)5. Midnight Ride(8/10)6. Born For Adventure(10/10)7. Prelude 12 (short instrumental song, I'm not gonna rate it)8. Sweet Madame Blue(10/10)As you can see, this album is good. After this album that came out in 1975, the albums will only get better with Crystal Ball(1976), The Grand Illusion(1977) and Pieces of Eight(1978)! These albums are even much better then this one!"
4,Pill Holder Review,"I have been very satisfied with these pill holders. I bought four of these holders to hold a month's worth of pills. Once a month, when the four are empty, I fill them all with a selection of all of the pills I take each morning."
1,mediocre,I cannot believe the high marks for this book. This book purports to be a management manual and a historical view of Alexander's life. It is quite mediocre on both fronts. The historical side is full of inaccuracies and the management side is far too simplistic to have any real value. If one is interested in reading about Alexander's military genius I would recommend The Generalship of Alexander the Great J.F.C. FULLER
1,Worst tena pads ever,"These pads use to be the best on the market,but now the company has redone them. The new pads are so thin everything runs right thru them, they are basically worthless. WE SUGGEST YOU DON'T BUY THEM!!!!!!"
5,THE TITLE SAYS IT ALL...,THIS IS A BOOK ABOUT WHAT IS WRONG WITH LIFE INSURANCE. IT HAS A COVER. NOT SOMETHING YOU CAN READ FROM COVER TO COVER BUT ITS A GREAT RESOURCE...RECEIVED IT IN EXCELLENT CONDITION. ONLY TOOK A FEW DAYS TO GET IT WITH STANDARD SHIPPING.
4,a GEM if you like depressive tones,"don't listen when your beloved left you, you may really want to die!"
2,Ripoff shipping charger,"When I saw the item was only a 2 dollar 2oz. package I did not pay attention to the shipping cost thinking it would be minimal! No, they outrageously charged me $7.00 shipping for an item that weighed nothing. It ate up my gift certificate!"
4,Better than I Thought,"I bought this and then read the online reviews, which weren't very kind...and I almost didn't read it. Then I grabbed it to read on a train from Dover to New York and found that it was a satisfying, straightforward horror with very nice language and believable charactes. I'll read more of her stuff, 'cause I see some real talent here."
4,A must for Previous PB Users,Makes you very comfortable with PB 7 techniques and tricks.... A must Buy/ A must Try....... Tooo Good!
5,Sing Me a Brawdy Song by Noema Ayers,"Noema Ayer's warm, realistic story of an American family covers an interesting but forgotten period of America's history. Recovering from the terrors of World War I and the hardships of the Great Depression of the 1920's, the Britten family serves as a wonderful example of the incredible socio-economic changes taking place as a nation of strong, self-reliant men and women struggles to keep food on the table and a roof over their heads. Stoic heros, Emma and Casey, meet the challenges of long separations and the formidable demands of World War II. A good read from beginning to end!"
3,"Awesome cartoon, Sorry DVD",Im a 24 years old and I love this cartoon. I watched most of the first season on thanksgiving. Its a fantasticly visual cartoon and the story is addicting. The onlt thing I hate is that you spend a good amount of money for only 4 episodes on a DVD!To this I say BOO to nickelodeon. :o(
1,Fake Anmie!,Pepole think this is a anmie show full of great action well let me tell you something! IT'S NOT! True the animation may look like it but I have been reading Naruto for a few years and this is totaly copying it. For a while I have seen Nickloden trying to copy anmie anmation and this is the only one that has seceded! Martin Mystery was terbile and went of the air in about 2 weeks after it's permire. Avtar on the other hand really pisses me off somneone should sue Nickloden for all this copyright they are doing. Pepole will probley be appeled to it at first but will slowley stop to watch it and pay more atintion to Naruto as with the secound season. If you are looking for true anmie watch Dragon Ball or Dragon Ball Z and Dragon Ball GT (Sometimes show Uncut) Naruto (Uncut verson realsed in july) or Full Metal Alchumist( shown on Adult Swim after cartoon network beacuse of it's viloince and language). Be Warned your buying fruad here and keep away from any anmie made by nickloden!
4,Great show!,"I started watching this show on nickelodeon because of my daughter, and I've gotten hooked on it! It's so unique, I love the story and the asian influence. The DVD itself I gave four stars because the DVD animation quality is a little less than I would hope, and there's only four episodes on a disk. But besides that, I love the show itself. Worth seeing!"
5,Excellent Series for the Whole Family,"Avatar is an excellent animated series for the whole family; enticing characters with engaging storylines, captivating action and good humor. I personally feel this is the best animated series being produced. I highly recommend this series to anyone. As a father of 2 children, I think this is easily the most meaningful and morally responsible series available for families as a whole on television (cable or no). Great fun for all; our whole family (my wife too) is eagerly waiting to see the next episodes when the next DVD becomes available.Sincerely,Dennis Mace"
2,"Interesting topic, poor writing.","I was very disappointed with this book. I was distracted by the numerous and glaring typos and felt like I was reading a book written on the 4th or 5th grade level. The childish and unsophisticated style of the writing was annoying and in my opinion, took credibility away from the author. This book is more of a quick fun read, rather than a serious source of historical information."
3,"Well spoken, poorly written","It was a well thought out, lightly descriptive book whose contents were a tribute to the poor women who had to sell their bodies for money. However, I felt the way (language, grammer, style etc.) in which it was written was somewhat simplistic. It seemed as though I was reading a Freshman literature paper. It is a shame, because the content of the book was very exciting and informative."
4,"Beautiful, but can't figure out how to get a picture in!!??","The necklace is beautiful, but there are no directions/instructions about how to get a picture into the locket. Very frustrating! To make things worse, I contacted Amazon, and they could not tell me any additional information. I find it strange that they do not know simple information about a product they sell. The necklace is beautiful (4 stars), but since it does not do what it is supposed to, and because of Amazon's poor service, I would change my vote to 1 star."
5,Washington D.C.,"Shame, shame!! Every American needs to read this and understand that not everywhere, and especially in our own Nation's capital are all Americans free to vote. In a democracy! How sad. I am a historian and have researched this one because I had a hard time believing it. America wake up!"
5,The New Christy Minstrels/Tell Tall Tales & Land of Giants: a 2-album CD set,"I bought this CD again (along with Presenting/In Person) to keep it for a remembrance for the same reason as I mentioned in my review about the Presenting/In Person CD, but also because it could no longer play the last 2 songs on my CD Walkman."
1,Lotsa noise but no action,"I don't know what product most of the reviewers are using but threw mine in the trash after two tries at using it. It is heavy and noisy but the motor has no power. It pulls hair out when the density of the hair gets great enough. This is not the wahl trimmer I had before (looks similar, however)."
5,Excellent Clippers,"An excellent clippers for anyone looking to maintain their own style from home. Well constructed and plenty of power. The 24-piece attachments are a nice accessory and offer plenty of options. The hard storage case is quite nice, but a little small to hold all 24-pieces. That mattered little since you can keep just what you are going to use in the case very easily. The rest can be stored in a separate bag or container. I would recommend this to my friends."
4,Wahl 79524-500 Haircut Kit,Good product that I feel you will be happy with. This is not loud as some have stated if adjusted properly. This is a professional product as they advertise.
3,There is a reason why people pay to get haircut,"I brought this kit with a thought - ""why am I spending $30 for which I don't care much?"". This was my first attemp of cutting my own hair and I guess the kit did the job as described, but I can tell you that it wasn't easy at all. I was going to clean up the sides and back, but ended up giving myself a very short buzz cut... If you're ready to pay the price, this product is for you..."
2,Heavy and LOUD!!,"This sucker is heavy, which I don't mind so much, but it's embarrassingly loud - your neighbours will know when you trim. And when no guide comb is attached, it won't even cut close enough to trim the back of the neck.If I was you, I'd spend a few extra bucks and get one of the next models up in the range."
2,price-gouging?,"i have a monthly subscription for these pads (which are great!) from amazon, for which i pay about 14-15.00 per month with free shipping. all of a sudden this month they raised the price to 49.00 for the 72-ct package! this is NOT a mistake apparently, just a price hike. so i've canceled my subscription and gone instead to walgreen site, where i can subscribe at the same old rate and have free shipping as well. Very disappointed in Amazon, as this seems an unreasonably high price."
1,fiction,"not bad as fiction. the entire book may be read online. However it is fiction that, unfortunately, seems to be regarded as a non-fiction source.An original review of the book:Review of 'Letters of Pontius Pilate', Manchester Guardian, 30 March 1928Crozier's interests in Latin and Greek classics and the Bible inspired his writing. His first novel, 'Letters of Pontius Pilate - Written during his Governorship of Judea to His Friend Seneca in Rome', was published in 1928, and is reviewed in the Manchester Guardian by Professor Herford of Manchester University."
2,disappointed,"Having read the reviews, my hopes were high for this book. I did find tidbits here and there that were useful, thus the 2 stars, but I fundamentally disagree with the premise of the book. I feel that children drift away from God because we force them to confine God-- put God in a non-teen shaped box. The focus of this book, that of the jealous nature of the God expressed in the First Testament, is not what today's youth are thirsting for. I understand the concept of worship as defined within but do not find narrowing the pathway to God to be the way to an informed, intelligent love affair with God that will grab a kid and hold him/her for life."
3,"Okay, but not great","This is the 4th radio of this type I've owned, the last being a Sony SRFM73. After reading the poor reviews of the Sony sucessor version, I decided to give this Panasonic a try. I must say that I' ve been a little disappointed in my first impression. If you're considering this unit you should be aware that the headset is very weak. I don't like the way it fits in my ears, and the minijack doesn't sit properly in the socket, so that when I first plugged in, there was no sound, and I had to fiddle around with it to get a connection. Then I would lose good connection when the cord was bumped. I ended up using the head phones from the Sony, which work better. That said, I don't think the reception is that great. The sound was a little fuzzy. Things I like, are the small size and the price."
1,Not a good buy,"The radio broke only after a few months of normal indoor use at the gym(8-10 hours per week). Some of the preset buttons stopped working first. Soon thereafter, the unit just stopped working completely. Very disappointed with the purchase."
1,Unsatisfied,"I previously had a Sony sports radio and enjoyed that, but thought I would try and save some money and get this one when I accidentally broke my Sony and that was a big mistake. The sound quality was very poor and the headphones very cheap."
1,Dont' buy it!,"Just after 3 months the on/off button broke down, shortly after the button lock feature stopped working.Before this, when I put the unit in my coat pocket, at the slightest movment it would turn itself on, if the button lock was not on. So, if you are not consiencious enought to put the button lock on each time, expect to burn through a slew of batteries."
5,Looking for quality sound?,"Sounds terrific! I purchased it based on the reviews. I must say it exceeded my expectations. I've owned my share of portable radios and the RF-SW50 has by far the best quality sound. You will want to replace the headset with one that is more comfortable, but the radio is worth it."
3,For the Older Child - not 3's or even 4's,"Most Kumon books are awesome. This book would be better labeled for a 5 or 6 year old. Too difficult, requires too much dexterity, print too small for younger ones - especially boys. Just my opinion."
3,"Lots of stuffs covered, but very disorganized",It is hard to imagine to use this book in a class. No wonder most of class notes based on this book has to reorganize from different chapters to present one subject. I believe this will make a really great textbook as well as a reference both for students and engineers if authors spend more time to have a good flow of subjects.
2,"Too scattered, not good in any one of the subjects.","I bought this book because it covers a lot of very useful subjects. However,I was very dissappointed reading it. It is too skimpy, not clearly explained and scattered. Almost any subject covered in this book is better covered in other books. It will make a very poor text book indeed. There are a lot of good books on signal integrity; from masterpieces like Clayton Paul's ""Electromagnetic Compatibility"" to the simple but pleasant book by Howard Johnson. There are infinitely better books on digital circuit design, on PLLs, on parasitic capacitances. Even subjects I knew before, I had a hard time following. I have to admit there are interesting sections with nice ideas that I haven't seen in any other books, but these little sections don't make up for the short comings of this book. Throwing things together doesn't make a good book. You have to care to write clearly and explain things."
3,Finding your spiritual practices,"This is a good book, it uses the chakras to describe which spiritual practices are good for people. It was good, but I was honestly expecting a little more detail, and information"
5,I really liked the flavor of the Dark ...,I really liked the flavor of the Dark Chocolate Fudge Slim Fast Shake. It has a full chocolate taste without the chalky after taste and texture that some weight loss shakes have. It left me with a very satisfied feeling.
1,The abuse is real,The abuse was real. Do not purchace this book as you will be enabling a child abuser
5,Definitely what I wanted.,"I was looking for a complete guide to butchering and storing of livestock and game meats, that is exactly what I got in this book. I was pleasantly surprised."
5,Good Stuff,This book is honestly full of all the good stuff the basics a few good tips and even a couple recipes at the back.
2,This book covers the very basic requirements of butchering.,"I found the book to be satisfactory if that. Illustrations are good but in some cases not very accurate, and at times confusing. The section of the preseravation of meats could have been left out. Its outdated. This book would great for Grizzly Adams or the Waltons."
1,Didnt help my performance,"This product didn't help me in any tangible ways, so I cannot recommend this to others. I have tried numerous types of supplements and have found that my daily multi-vitamin is about all I need coupled with a good diet and plenty of sleep."
4,EAT WHAT YOU KILL,Grandmaster Melle Mel & Scorpio are OG's of hip hop and this is a good cd. Still rappin' hard and totally relevent!
3,"Fun and useful, but these last about as long as a Kleenex","While these are useful and fit nicely on the flash, but for more than $20 I hoped they would last a tad longer. I tried the blue gel first, and it melted on one single shot!This said, if you haven't tried gels on your flash, you ought to. The improvements are huge."
2,Very bad quality sofa,"Yes, indeed, the sofa looked great on the picture for me too, in addition to that the reviews were just excellent, though, I suspect the were written by request of the company's owner. The sofa proved to be of a bad quality, awfully inconvenient and doesn't have much of space as a sofa compared to other ones. As one of the reviewers noted the useless pillows slide off, the sofa has a bar in the middle once it turns into bed and I have backaches all the time after I sleep on it. I did not have much of a choice a year ago when I moved into a new apartment, and it seemed to be as a good idea to buy this bed from the Internet. I doubt I will ever be purchasing furniture online after this terrible experience!"
2,Average,I would not purchase this if you are looking for something nice. It is convenient if you are looking for something easy such as for a college setting. I rushed into the purchase and regret buying the couch. I may give this to my brother who is starting graduate school and buy another one for my place.
5,perfect for my apartment,"I bought this futon as a couch for my college apartment and my roommate and I LOVED it. It is so easy to switch between the bed and couch so that guests could sleep comfortably when they stayed the night. The exterior looks and feels smooth and soft but is easily cleaned. And it's really durable. After using it two years in my college apartment, I brought it back home to my own room."
1,Rowenta Poor Quality-Automactic Shut Off,"The Rowenta DX 8800 has a quality issue. I purchased this iron in January, 2009. It randomly shut off after only two weeks. The iron was replaced by Amazon in February , 2009. It is now September, 2009 and the new iron is again randomly shutting off. I understand that the iron can be repaired under warranty but the repair can take up to two months.The iron is fine when it works. I will not purchase a Rowenta again because of the poor quality."
2,Good while it worked.....,"The iron worked well, when it worked. A little over a year after purchase it began shutting off while I was ironing. Then the water uptake tube came loose. After that happened the iron couldn't pull water from the reservoir for the steam. I attempted to open the iron and fix the tube, but there's no way to get to anything but the electronics and wires on this one. Durability of this product from my experience, and the experiences I have read from others, is bad."
4,It's heavy but it works well,"I wanted an iron I could use for sewing, quilting and ironing clothes. I specifically wanted a ""shot of steam"" feature similar to my 30 year old iron that had died, where you can spray a little bit of steamy water in front of where you are ironing. This iron meets those criteria. It has a sharp point in front, which does make it easier to get in those sewing corners. It has well-distributed steam, and that works well. It uses spring water and I always have that around. The directions are very clear. I like the fact that it shuts off and then turns back on when you wiggle it. That is particularly useful for quilting.It is HEAVY. Very heavy. It is also tall, which will take some getting used to. I feel like my hand is very far from the cloth. Of course, that is perception, not reality."
2,Worked great for 2 years,This is my second Rowenta and it seems that they only last 2 years... If I can get parts to fix this one... I'll keep it... If not hello Black & Decker!!
2,Great while it lasted,"Rowenta DX-8800 1750-Watt Professional IronI had this iron for a couple of years and it did a great job ironing my clothes until it started to LEAK WATER! Not fun when you are in the middle of ironing your clothes! I thought somehow the water tank had a hairline crack in it, so I started filling it halfway which worked for a short time. Then it got to the point where I was putting an inch or two of water in so that it wouldn't leak. The other day I went to iron and the water (all two inches) just leaked out. I am done! This was my second Rowenta ( I think the first one died an unhappy death also.) There will not be a third Rowenta in this house. Gone shopping for a new iron."
2,Bad Game Good Story,"This game has a great story line. Other than that everything else falls short. I bought this game when it first came out based off all the reviews.The game play is very slow, and when I say slow I mean very very slow. Abilities are limited and not really needed. Your standard attacks become vastly more powerful and are quicker to use. The combat get overly redundant even for an RPG. The combat sounds are highly annoying and very little between characters and attacks.The story is great. The only reason I played this to the end was to see the ending (and the fact that I was to close to the end to just throw it out the window). The characters themselves are pretty well diversified with a slight amount of depth.If you are looking for an RPG that's great storyline and gameplay to keep you addicted -- this is definitely not it!. If you love the classic RPG style and really want something for the PC without using an emulator than you might be amused for a short time."
3,"Let's Go, Routers!","Yep, this it the bunch that started that whole clap clap, clap clap clap, clap clap clap clap, let's go, routine that you hear at sports arenas everywhere (you didn't think some stadium announcer came up with that did you?). This was an album intended to cash in on this studio group's only hit record, ""Let's Go"". Most of the songs are sports oriented and give the folks in the stands something to do during boring stretches. Nice bass horn by an uncredited musician on ""Half Time"". Good gift for your high school band geek friends."
4,Architectural Designs Around the World,"This is a great resource for anyone interested in Architecture. It gives really good background information on the history of architecture in many different areas of the world. And if you need some really good photographical examples, this a great book. It also includes great picture descriptions so that you can relate it to the body of the work. This book has a wide range of architecture from much earlier ages to the modern age.All in all, I highly recommend this book if you need a resource for a project or if you're simply interested in architecture."
5,Awesome,"A great anthology of sermons, prayers, stories, personal testimonies to delve in and return to."
3,OK little clock,"We use this in the bathroom. It would be too small for a bedroom clock, unless you left the light on at all times. For our purposes it is good. It seems to keep good time and changed with the time change perfectly.Update: Have had the clock for awhile. The alarm keeps going off at midnight. You reset it and a few days later it happens again. Have taken the battery out many times, doesn't stop it."
5,Love these clocks,These clocks are so useful for those of us that wake up in the middle of the night.They make great gifts also.
1,One Annoying Little Alarm Clock.....,"Such a disappointment. The digital readout is not lit, so the only way to see the clock at night is to look at the ceiling. Fine if you're in bed, otherwise, useless. It does have a button you can push to turn on a light... but by that time I'm way too annoyed anyway. It also has the most obnoxious high-pitched beeping for the alarm - which was complicated to use anyway. I have already tossed this piece of junk and got my son a decent radio alarm clock with a light. Far more practical than the projection feature. The only positives are that it is compact and self-setting. Don't buy this thing."
2,Time Zones???,"When this clock operates correctly it is great, but the manufacturers need to include a time zone for Hawaii. Setting the clock for Hawaii time is fine but after a few days the actual time reverts to the time zone showing on the face of the clock. There is a mechanism for turning off the time zone feature but it is sensitive and often takes several attempts to implement. ."
3,good but not great,"I like the idea and I like the size. But the fact that you cant adjust the projection makes this almost useless for me. In order to get the projection the right size on your ceiling or wall you have to place it in a certain place, which is often inconvenient."
5,Outstanding alarm clock,This is a great little alarm clock. I like the laser feature that displays on the ceiling. You don't have to hit any buttons on the clock to see the time. The sound is not earth shattering. It has a nice wake up tone. Great value for the money. I would highly recommend.
3,Oregon Projected Clock,"The clock works fine, but the power cord was spliced and another plug added on the end. I could not give it as a gift in that condition. Therefore, I kept it as a second. It works fine but I have hidden the cord behind the bed post."
4,good but hard to see,"The clock is hard to see during the day. At night it is very easy because of the projection display but that becomes impossible to read during the day the size of the LCD display is not large enough to see from a distance. It works very well as an alarm clock however, especially if you wake up early in the morning while it is still dark."
4,better than the older model,"I bought this item because I had an older version of it for an alarm clock for over 6 years and loved it. This version is slightly different, with the same buttons but setting it requires a different series of buttons. The alarm is loud and clear, and pitch increases if you don't turn it off. Snooze button is easy to reach. Laser display makes no noise as it projects (the old one did) and lasts only a few seconds after you turn on the back light of the screen and can be turned off if you wish."
1,"Waste of money, spend the extra $5-10 and get something that will last","This thing is about as cheap as they come, dont know hoe it got so many good reviews. This thing is garbage"
5,my second,someone gave me one like this a couple af years ago loved it then and love my new one.I would buy this as a gift anyday.
5,Projection a great idea,"This is a competent clock, with easy features and a bit more heft than most atomic alarm clocks. It stays on my wife's night table and is not knocked off by cats. The great feature, for me, is the projection time, which is a great way to see the time without moving an arm out of the warmth of cover. Without glasses, I see the time clearly on the ceiling, but it is not so bright as to disturb anyone. My wife's eyesight, without glasses, is poor, but she can still make out the time in the night. A nice feature I never realized I wanted!"
5,Great Alarm Clock,"The alarm clock runs on 2 AA batteries so you don't have to worry about the power going out and missing your alarm to get up for work. My wife has only had to replace the batteries once in the past five years. The projected time display is great for when you're in bed and wondering what time it is. The alarm beeps slowly and lightly at first and then slowly progresses to a louder, more persistent tone. It doesn't abruptly or rudely wake you up. The alarm clock automatically updates the time and monitors the room temperature. I can't say enough about how great of a little clock this thing is, especially for the price and size. I highly recommend it for anyone looking for a solid alarm clock at a decent price. Great device!"
3,Not quite what I expected.,"My parents have the La Crosse Technology WT-5120U Projection Alarm Clock with Outdoor Temperature found here on Amazon. This clock got better reviews than that one and was similar in price so I decided I would try it. It does do everything just as the other reviews have stated however I did find a couple of things disappointing. The biggest disadvantage was the the projector does not move and is pointed at a weird angle. In other models, you can position the projector to project the time where you want it. So, if you already have a place in mind for the clock, be prepared that when you put it there it may put the projection in an unreadable place. The other disadvantage is that the blue backlight does not stay lit, as another reviewer mentioned. Other than that, very easy to use and serves the purpose well."
1,Broken after 3 months,We received this as a gift to replace our old $20 cheapie that was over 5 years old and this lasted a total of 3 months of light use and it just died. I used to like cuisinart products however lately the quality has been pretty bad. I won't buy another cuisinart again at this point.
2,Food Processor,"The food processor makes the worst noise your ever heard, I thought I was going deaf.Using the blender is okay, works like others"
4,Cuisinart BFP-10 ch,"I had a refubished BFP-703 that quit working. The nice thing about this blender is the the blender jar and food processer attachment I saved fit this model. It is much more powerful and really works great.I recomend it. I would give it 4 out of 5 starsUnfortunately, my second one burned out too. So I bought separately a Braun food processor and a Ninja blender. So far both are great, maybe it is better to spend a little more money, get these items separately."
1,blender is a dud,The blender broke with the first use. We are now trying to return it. Proving some what difficult to do.
1,Worst blender ever made,"This is the ONLY thing you need to know about this blender:You *cannot* pour out the contents of the blender without it going everywhere. The lip is completely useless, as the glass is flat and doesn't channel the liquid to the lip; you cannot pour from the corners either because of the square shape - it will just spill over the sides.We thought this was a really nice blender, but a $20 blender from the grocery store performed 1,000x better.Bottom line: Do not buy this."
3,Cutting assembly froze up,"After several months of good use I noticed that the cutting assembly (i.e., the blade) is VERY stiff and does not rotate freely. It does not appear to be a user-serviceable part, therefore I am wary of trying to take it apart and oil it. This not only drastically reduces the power of the machine but I can see it frying the motor out if used.I've ordered another part, however if the second one freezes as well I would not recommend this unit at all."
3,Meh,Only worth the discount price. The plastic base and controls are minor. No locking top before turning the machine on.
2,disappointed,Processor makes good smoothies but not large enough..overflows. Blender will NOT make smoothies at all. Thought ordering a higher name brand would help no better than my cheap one I already had. Bad purchase!
2,Disappointed -,"I really liked the product initially when i used it but I have not used it for more than a month and the motor just stopped functioning. I complained to Cuisinart and all they can do is repair it but the shipping is at my expense and it would take them approx 4-6 weeks to repair it and send it back. So after spending so much on a blender it seems like a waste of money. I can't wait for 6 weeks without a blender and so I will have to buy another one. I am so disappointed, i would not recommend somebody to buy this product."
4,Convenient 2-in-1 and pretty strong motor.,"I got this product because I really needed a blender, and then realized I didn't have a food processor either. It's super convenient to have 2-in-1. The motor is really powerful; although it's pretty loud. I would recommend this to anyone."
1,twice your out,Was given as a gift. Used twice and the motor burned out. Under warranty but will cost me shipping to repair center and $10 for return ship. unit is 1.5 years into 3yr warranty. Two smoothies and your out.
1,DISAPPOINTED,"THE MACHINE IS VERY NOISY -- SMELLS LIKE SOMETHING IS BURNING - THE LIP ON THE JAR IS VERY ACKWARD YOU MUST POUR IT FROM THE SIDE -- YOU CAN'T POUR FROM THE FRONT AS THE LIP IS NOT DEEP ENOUGH. I AM VERY SORRY FOR THE PURCHASE -- I DON'T HAVE THE BOX TO RETURN THE ITEM. ALSO, MOST OF THE BUTTON FUNCTIONS ARE THE SAME -- VERY LITTLE IF ANY VARIATIONS WITH THE SPEED OR PROCESS. ALL IN ALL I AM VERY VERY DISAPPOINTED."
1,SUCKS! Does Not make smoothies!,We just returned this item. It will not even blend ice or frozen fruit! Everything just sits there. We were stirring and stirring with a spoon trying to get our smoothies made. DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM if you are wanting to blend ice drinks!
1,A blender that won't blend!!,"I got this as a store promotion, so all it cost me was the food I purchased and collecting ""Happy Points"". I'm a big fan of Cuisinart. I have many things from them. I first used this thing on December 26. I was making a smoked salmon appetizer, using smoked salmon, sofetened cream cheese and some dried dill. Within moments of turning the motor on to the lowest speed above pulse, the motor started smoking profusely. I turned it off, gave it a few minutes, turned it back on, and it was dead!! I took out my old 1982 Hamilton Beach blender, transferred the contents, and voille', I had my appetizer made in a jiffy. I have let this thing sit for 5 days now, took it out today, filled it up half way with water. The motor is dead, dead, dead..Fortunate for me, I have a receipt that is worth 89.99, and I will be returning this to my local grocery store."
1,Burned out motor after two months of daily use,"I originally bought this product a couple years ago mostly for the food processor (which worked fine for shredding cheese the whole two times I used it). It didn't really get much use until recently. About two months ago, I started using the blender for green smoothies. I was using it every morning, blending bananas, leafy greens and small frozen berries. It started having this burning hairdryer smell a few weeks ago but seemed to be doing alright aside from that. The motor burned out this morning when i was only trying to blend liquids and a banana. Now I'm out a blender AND a food processor. Never buying one of these combo things again. Never buying Cuisinart products again (their other products could be fantastic for all I know, but I'm one to hold grudges)."
1,This FAKE appliance won't last long,"When my Hamilton Blender which I've owned for years finally died, I bought the Cuisinart Power Blend Duet to make my morning smoothies. At first it worked well and I particularly liked the ice breaker feature, but a couple of weeks after use, it started to smell like it was burning. Everytime I used it I thought that it was going to be the last time because of the burning smell. Well, this morning I used the food processor component of the Cuisinart, to puree some turnips. The burning smell was particularly bad and in the middle of the food preparation, the Cuisinart died. I have owned it a total of three months. I am so disappointed but blame myself for buying it in the first place, considering the 'chrome' is nothing more than plastic! You get what you pay for and I bought this on sale for $99. It was not worth it!"
2,Doesn't chop well,"The food processor part of this combo doesn't chop evenly. It always leaves large pieces unchopped and almost liquefies some of the rest. I have used this several times each to chop onions, green peppers, and fish fillets (to make fish cakes) and every time it did a surprisingly bad job. I have to keep stopping it, taking the lid off, and pushing the large pieces to the bottom. Meanwhile the pieces already chopped just keep getting smaller until they liquefy. To get a more even chop requires chopping about 1/4 of a small onion at a time, or perhaps 1/2 or one small fish fillet. It's the worst food processor I've ever used. The blender part works pretty well though."
2,Underpowered,"The motor is underpowered, isn't really able to crush ice very well or make a smoothie without a lot of effort / cavitating / stop-and-start on my part. Also, if I run it for more than a minute or so (blender or food processor), the motor starts to smell a bit like it's going to burn out (this was from the very first time I used it).It works ""just okay"", and I'm just waiting for it to burn up so I can get something better."
2,Didn't holed up to lite use!,"We've had our blender for about 3 years and have used it only for blending salsas and sauces, used maybe total of 20-25 times. It died this past weekend while blending grilled vegetables and avacados for a sauce, nothing difficult about that but the unit didn't sound right and like it was bogging down, then just died. There wasn't any electrical smell or excessive heat that I could tell, it just sounded like it was struggling and died. I assume the motor and electronics are bad. We also have a 3-year old Cuisinart microwave which after only a year and half of use, the carousel motor went out. I was able to find a replacement on-line after getting no answers from Cuisinart othar than having to send it in. If I were Cuisinart, I'd look for a new motor supplier."
1,Short life,"I paid for this with frequent flyer miles from Delta Shopping about two years ago, and used it about twice a month since then, mainly for smoothies. Yesterday it died while I was mixing a smoothie."
5,So far great blender,"Just got this blender,so I wanted a few day to play with it. Burning smell lasted only during break in. All the small electronic kitchen equipment that I've owned has been that way. Great smoothie maker. Crushes ice very well. Easy to clean. Attractive enough to leave on the counter. The shape of the jar is a bonus. The small processor is a breeze to use on small jobs, I now do not have to pull out large processor every time that I need one. [...]. Belks had the same one on sale for $[...] plus tax. One thing that helped me was to read my manual first which said to add liquid ingredients first. So far so good."
2,Tempermental,I bought this blender with high hopes. My first one made a couple great smoothies. Then it started smoking like it was about to burst in flames. I returned it and got another thinking it was just a fluke. My second one lasted about 9 months with limited use and only using the low speeds. I was having some problems blending a smoothie and kicked it up to the higher gears and clicked the ice crusher button a couple of times and it died. After research it seems the ice crusher button is a kill switch for this blender. If you keep it in the low gears its great and who wouldn't want a food processor but if you kick it up into a higher gear make sure you have room in your trash and kiss your money good buy.
5,"If you like Led Zepplin, you will Love Zebra!!",I am a big fan of 70's - 80's music. The only cd worth the trouble to locate and add to my collection was Zebra!! For the life of me I can't understand why they never made it to the top!!! BUY IT!!!! It's worth every dime you spend on it!
4,excellent seattle indy band - WATCH THEM FLY,"VERY COOL, ROCKS AND RHYMES AND LOTS OF HARMONIES AND IN YOUR FACE GUITARS AND DRUMS SO LOUD THAT PEOPLE CALL THE POLICE AND STUFF."
5,Good review book for HESI and NCLEX,"What I really liked about this book is the rational for the what and why this is the best answer, and the layout is good with the answers a page following the questions, not having to hunt for answer in back of book. The 4000 question CD is a great application as well. There is a solid reason WHY its not readily available!"
3,SOOOO BULKY,The clock looks great but its like 5 inches thick so it looks very bulky especially for a kid's room
1,Written by the pet food industry,"This book was profoundly disappointing. I expected information on feeding my animals food ""fit for human consumption"" and from my kitchen (versus store bought). I realized shortly into the book that it was written by experts at Iams Company, a maker of pet food. Their recommendations are based on meeting the Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO) guidelines - a committee developed by the pet food industry when they decided they did not care for the requirements recommended by the Committee of Animal Nutrition of the National Research Council (NRC) of the National Academy of Science.I did get one good tip from the book on how to clean my kitchen after working with raw meat. Otherwise, there are much better books out there for people looking for healthier pets through the food system."

4,I am really impressed with this product. I ...,"I am really impressed with this product. I recently had to take a 10-day dose of antibiotic, which I was to take 4 times a day. I failed to do so properly and had a reoccurrence of my mastitis. I now have the EZY dose organizer and feel I won't have a problem keeping up with my doses. I find the suggested timing on each compartment will help me space my doses apart appropriately. Since I work 2 days a week the pop-out option of the organizer will come in handy."
5,What a great product! My best beloved is ...,"What a great product! My best beloved is a stroke survivor so he takes lots of medications. How nice to finally have one object with enough time divisions to coordinate his daily regime! He especially likes to have each day's dosage in a small enough container to slip into his briefcase. It's great for me, too! No longer do I have to ask him if he's remembered to take his pills -- just a quick glance and I know. We'll never use anything else."
4,One of the great things about this product ...,"One of the great things about this product is how the daily trays pop out so they can be carried along with you. The organizer tray has helped me keep my medicine organized, and take my doses ON TIME! I would definitely recommend this product."
5,This pill organizer works wonderfully. I have pills ...,"This pill organizer works wonderfully. I have pills that I have to take every day for the rest of my life, and I must admit that there are days that I can't remember if I've taken them or not!! (It's an age thing I think?!?!?!) With this organizer, I can tell at a glance! I would definitely recommend this product."
5,What a wonderful book,I loved this book. It made me cry but mostly it opened my eyes to what Army wives have to go through. It didn't just focus on the bad which there is a lot of it also showed how in love and happy they can be. Army wives have a hard life and this book shows that Army wives really do have the toughest job in the Army.
1,"Depressing, One sided","I've never been in the military nor been married to a military man, though my father and brother were in the military a long time ago. This book was very well written, but very depressing. I'm glad that there are military women on here who have left feedback telling how happy they are, because otherwise I would have thought that all women or men who marry someone in the military are living in total fear and depression. I'm sad that these terrible things happened to these people, but as other people on here have said, it's a book based on a short amount of time in one town, and it's not a complete picture. It seems like the author would have written a more balanced piece, being a reporter and all. I am glad I read the book, but I wouldn't recommend it , as it is just too sad."
1,Stolen information!!,The wives this book is about never received any compensation for their stories or time.The woman who wrote this book stole their stories and never gave them a chance to read it before she published it. She exploited them and their weaknesses and sold their stories to Lifetime.Don't buy this book new! Get it from the library or something but don't make this sociopath anymore money on this stolen content.
3,Not what we expected.,"My wife received this book as a gift from my mother after I recommended it to her. The recipes are much more elaborate that what we were looking for. They contain numerous ingredients, many of which are not our common staples. This alone make this book unsuitable for our style of camping. The directions do encourage at home preparation, but this, again, was not what we were looking for. We want to be able to use fewer ingredients, prepare on site, and still make delicious, appetizing meals in the great out doors! We'll keep looking."
2,Disappointed,"Got this phone three weeks ago because of the special deal for new subscribers with Verizon. How disappointing! Like others, it emits an ANNOYING high-pitched noise. The person on the other end sounds like they're standing in a metal box (hollow), and I always hear my own comments echoing back a second or two later. The phone does not hold a charge long, either. I don't talk on it much, yet I'll take it out of my purse to make a call only to find it dead! My family got three and they are all the same. Stay away from this phone!"
2,Extremely frustrating!!!,"This phone is great--sometimes. When it's not, it's a nightmare. The 1st time I bought the LG VX5200 camera phone (December 2005), I had it for 4 days and it crashed irreparably. I got a new one. Now, about 6 months after I bought the second one, it did the same thing. And my sister's did the same as well. What happens is the screen goes to white with the Verizon logo and it stays that way. Only taking the battery out turns off the phone. But when you put it back in and try to turn the phone on, it just goes to the white screen. I even tried replacing the battery. I have also read of similar things happening to others with this phone, so I don't recommend this phone at all."
3,"Lightweight, no nonsense","I just recently replaced my old LG with this one and from a practical standpoint it delivers. This model is lightweight and fairly compact. Reception has always been good. Has some basic color themes which really a variations of red, yellow and blue themes. Not exactly the most customizable phone out there.There were some issues I had with the design immediately. On the outside there is a button which activates the camera, so sometimes after I tuck it into my sidepocket I accidently take twenty pictures of lint and keys. Its annoying to delete these pictures, so I suggest getting a holster if you can."
1,Not a good phone,I had the same problems as the other reviewer below except that I returned mine for a new one and then had the same lock up problem. There is obviously something wrong with this phone.
4,The Guitar Maker's Manual,"After being involved in building instruments since 2007. I returned to this book and was surprised at all the excellent tips in this book. Experience made it a better read.It covers tools, techniques and tips that are useful. A nice manual for some techniques that one can use in the shop."
5,mahoganys best,i love this band anything on this 3 cd set is the best i had all of these im glad they are back out a MUST for mahogany rush die hards LOVE you Frank
4,"Simple, clear steps for turning your ideas into commercialized products","I found the book easy to understand and read. It was laid out very well and was simple to find what I needed.It was odd to find the last chapter was only 1 page. I need to know how to make money after I turned my idea into a product.Give it a read, it will help you. It helped me."
2,FUN Game.. BAD Glitches!,"This is a very entertaining game but it's filled with all sorts of annoying glitches. It got to the point where I just stopped caring to play because I knew from reading a few articles that once I got to a certain point in the game, I wouldn't be able to continue because of a really bad glitch. There are patches you can download online to fix some of the glitches but it doesn't help them all. It's sad because this game has potential and it's predecessor was very entertaining but I just can't get past all the issues with the glitches."
4,=),"I still play this game and I bought it when it first came out. It's fun but it ""can"" have glitches, mine were all audio related on my old old computer(when I first got the game) but I got a new system so they aren't a problem anymore. This game is fun to play so just buy it already. It was much better than the first installment of this series and I am also awaiting another title to come out. If you like vampires and rpg games then give this a chance. v-v"
1,Doesnt work Nvidia & Windows XP,"I get a black screen upon launch and must reboot my computer a dozen times afterwards. I've emailed tech support, downloaded a patch, and perused their problem board all to no avail. Now Doom3 works fine on my system. I dislike their solution, though I tried it, of changing my registry. I think software companies shouldnt even dream of suggesting to customers that they edit their registry. Instead, they should put out a playable game. As it stands, Vampire: Bloodlines, not only doesn't launch, it wasted hours of my time trying their solutions (including putting my desktop in 800x600 although the game box says they support 1200x1600). What gives here?"
2,Falls Apart at the End,"Great game, until it devolves into a mindless beat-em up with wave after wave of spawning enemies spamming you to death. It's like some other developer finished the game and turned it into a console button masher. And the switch to third person during hand-to-hand and melee combat doesn't help.It starts out great though, so if you can handle TONS of combat for the last third of this game (remember to put ALL exp. points into combat related skills during and after the much maligned sewer level) buy it."
3,Not as good as the hype,"I bought this because of the hype I heard from other gamers. They were wrong. A simple storyline and a good soundtrack don't make a 5 star game. It's a 3 at tops.Good: Soundtrack (music), ok storyline, somewhat non-linear story line. Character development.Bad: Loooong load times everytime you leave a building, or go into sewers or even start the game at the load screen, it takes forever.Who the hell are the guys around every corner attacking me that don't get arrested by the police? They can attack me all day long but as soon as I fight back, the police open fire on me alone?The bugs are way too many and are a pain in the [...].Give it a try if you want or wait till it hits the bargain bin."
5,Great game with noticeable glitches,"one of the downsides of this game is the price. it came out several years ago, but it's hard to find a copy of it, new or used, for less than 20 dollars. i tried for a week or two and eventually ended up buying it for full price, which sucked.then there's the stuff about the patches. for someone who isn't savvy like that using computers, i found it all very confusing. the game definitely has glitches. in the one i bought, the worst glitch is that whenever the character frenzies, or when you use the protean discipline with the gangrel character, the screen goes all white and you can't see anything. i have to believe this is a mistake and that the game makers didn't do this on purpose.overall, though, this is a fantastic game. very addictive. i wish it was longer, but most people who play it will finish it in a week. i'm eagerly looking forward to the next vampire game. hopefully, it won't be as buggy."
