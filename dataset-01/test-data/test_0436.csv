3,product quality good but ivory color not,"I ordered the ivory color of these plates as I wanted something neutral but not completely white. The ivory color is more of a yellow color so I sent them back. Overall, I loved the dishes and the fact that they are made in the USA and are lead-free. I will buy them again but find a color that works for me."
5,made in america,I currently own six of these sets in different colors. These plates are heavy and well made. Worth the price. My buffet now looks like something out of a Wes Anderson movie.
2,Fiesta Dishes,I have several place settings of Fiesta Dishes. I ordered 2 more place settings recently and was dissapointed with them. The dishes are warped and don't stack well with my other dishes. These dishes are apparently rejects. I love the idea of the Fiesta brand but these were not like my others.
2,Place setting,"I read the title wrong. I thought I was getting a setting for four. One of the cups came chipped and I made a note of it on here. I never got a response. I decided to keep it. I am not going to buy any more sets. I saw a few days ago at Kohls, they have the same set. It was probally cheaper with your Kohls discounts."
5,Excellent reference,"This book is for any mother in the process of divorce. Unlike one reviewer, I thought the author did an excellent job of explaining everything a mother needs to consider. The tips were so helpful...so many things I hadn't thought of! It gave me insight into my children's needs, and insight into alimony, custody, and child support, choosing an attorney, etc. I believe I got a much better settlement because of this book, and it gave me piece of mind to read the stories of the women it detailed. I bought several books to try to educate myself, but this one was the best by far. It covers so many topics. It should be recommended reading by attorneys, mediators, and marriage counselors."
3,Ohhhhhhhh boy!,"Not the greatest guide to ice skating! There is a lot on what you should wear and look for in skates, but as far as the skating goes. . . There's practically nothing in it! But what's in it is written well."
5,Incredibly useful!,"This is a beautiful collection of prayers with which every Catholic needs to be familiar. The prayers are thoughtfully organized, with brief and clear explanations where necessary. Of all the prayerbooks I've read over the years, this one has been the most useful in helping me focus my prayer time. This is an excellent value, and highly recommended!"
3,Not Bad!.....,"This album is not bad at all. My favorite tracks are #1, #4. & #11. The San jo one is not bad either. in fact i am listening to #11 right now. 4-22-03"
5,Movie with a Meaning,"The amount of people with Alzheimer's disease has more than doubled over the last couple of decades. I applaud the makers of this film for bringing this very serious and growing issue to light. The film does a brilliant job at capturing the very real and raw emotions of Alzheimer's victims and their families through the tastefully written and engaging story of Maine lobstermen. Through trials, tribulations and difficult truths, three generations of men (grandfather, father and son) pull together for support. Even if you do not know someone who has suffered from this illness, this film will touch you to tears. It's a must see."
5,This Book Changed the Way I Eat,"I found this book incredibly helpful in learning the truth about health and disease. My whole life, I loved dairy products, seafood, you name it. After reading this book, I went vegan - cutting out all animal products. Matthew Grace clearly demonstrated how most of our ""health problems"" are really side-effects of the way we eat. This book should be required reading for everyone, but especially people suffering from any diseases, and anyone interested in raw food diets."
3,Good points - yet not willing to compromise,"This book was very interesting and a quick easy read. Very helpful information. However, refuses to see any gray areas, everything is BLACK and WHITE. Eat all raw fruits and vegs isn't realistic. Also- needs to back up scientific claims with evidence or evidence based practice. Very EXTREME!"
3,so-so,"using this for a sociology class--mildly interesting, I would have liked to have more books to back it up for more detailed info, but overall a generally good book as far as basic info goes."
5,Required reading,"Sandra Steingraber is a poet, a scientist and an ecologist. She brings the best of all those worlds to an excellent review of the world in which we all ""live downstream."" Amazon's service and the quality of the book itself were also excellent."
5,WVAS Radio/ Eugenia Ricks,"Reviewer: WVAS Radio/ Eugenia RicksEugenia Ricks at WVAS in Montgomery, AL! Freddie Fox is one of the best new comers I think this year...I have added him...Thanks"
3,Great for kids... not for me,I got this for my grandson 6 years ago and he still plays it today. I don't like it but my grandson likes it so i play with him sometimes to make him happy.
2,Horrible Horrible Horrible!,"I have really enjoyed the Backyard Baseball series. But this latest version is awful. It's very different from the older versions. I was looking forward to using the gameplay actions as in the previous versions, but its all different. And HARD! I'm past 50 and a long-time computer user and this is just too hard for me. So you can believe it will be hard for a child, even using the easiest setting. And one thing I dislike is; you cannot SAVE the game you are playing. The ""3-D"" effect is poor, too. All the personality effects of the familiar players in the previous versions are now bland and robotic in this installment. I am VERY disappointed. I'll be going back to Backyard Baseball 2003!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Good CD,"Good CD. A lot of good original acoustic songs, but not nearly as good as So Jealous and The Con. 'My Number' is a great song -- but its great to see these girls continue getting better."
3,a bit derivative,"Tegan and Sarah are great, if you like Ani Difranco. Their music is brash and abrasive and seems to lean a little too heavily on thier influences. This could be the fault of the production which seems to be straining to be hip. Here's hoping these promising ladies find thier own voice on thier next outing."
3,Just fine for the price.,Could be considered as a basic gear for entry level outdoor activities such trail running but will temperatures no less than -10C.
4,Liner gloves,Actually I didn't buy them as liner gloves. I was looking for a light weight glove with some flexibility and durability. These fit the bill. They are perfect for dog walking in moderate winter weather. Fingers are a little short but they still work.
2,Cheap,"I think this is a case of getting what you pay for. Although they look ok and are pretty warm, the pair I got for my husband has some definite problems. The two gloves (sized L/XL) are two different sizes. One glove fits fine, but the other is much smaller (the fingers don't fit all the way on one side). Because of this bad fit, he wore them for the first time this morning and the smaller glove is already ripping. No good."
3,Don't see what the appeal is/was...,"Okay, so I saw all of the reviews claiming this was one of the greatest games. Bought one of the greatest hits versions, tried it, and to be honest, yes...the graphics are excellent, but the game itself is rather boring. There's just nothing appealing about the gameplay itself. There are many other fun games out there. If all you care about are fantastic graphics, this game is for you."
1,good graphis but b-o-r-i-n-g,"sorry I bought this game. Sure, the graphics were really good, but there was little adventure. A 'voice' talks to you, tells you to go kill the collosi, and then with little ingenuity you kill them one by one. You don't interact with the collosi, you just kill them and are transported back to the 'voice' for your next killing assignment. nope, didn't finish the game, killed 4 collosi and had enough."
4,Not so much a game as a work of art,"This game is simply amazing, it throws you into the middle of a story giving you barely enough to satisfy you and the story continues to build to a suprising (though a little strange) ending. You spend your time seeking out the colossi, but you can also just explore. The only things I didn't like was the shortness of the game, and the camera."
4,"wonderful game, lots of fun","this game is epic! the bosses are easy but FUN. this game is very short, it won't take you more than a couple days to beat it."
4,Well put together title.,"Every gamer should play this game through once. This is proof that this media is as much art as film can be. Its fun, interesting, and thought provoking."
1,Stunning visually but...,"I was very impressed but the graphics for this game. It was very much like watching a movie in most places and I agree with several of the other reviewers that there are no other games like it on the market. Sadly, that is the end of my positive statements on this game. Parts of it (particularly the traveling parts) are quite boring and tediously repetitious, not to mention that the horse is difficult to control. In fact, many times, it was just easier to run to where I was going rather than fight with the horse. However, once you find a Colossus the gameplay becomes extremely difficult. Don't get me wrong, I appreciate a challenge but this game is repetitious and far too difficult to be truly entertaining. Sad to say I feel like I wasted my money."
3,"Fun to play, but lacking depth.","There's no doubt in my mind that this was an entertaining game while it lasted, which was admittedly not long. The game is so straightforward (find it, kill it, repeat) that I finished it within two days. While the score and the enviornment definately add to the game, the lack of story was very dissapointing.There was a very basic premise to the game; your girlfriend is dead, and you want to bring her back with the help of a dubious god in a temple in the middle of nowhere. Cue your attacks on the collosi and don't stop until the game is over. Even then, the ending was extremely confusing and left me feeling unsatisfied and not knowing quite what had happened. While the replay value is somewhat decent (see"" Reminescence Mode"") I would suggest renting this game, but not buying it."
5,Another great game by the Ico team,This game has the same beautiful rendering style as Ico as well as their emphasis on smart combat. You have to use your head to beat the colossi. The controls are simple and effective and the atmosphere is engaging and urges you to find out more and resurect your love. It's nice to be challenged.
2,Too Extreme,I tried several of these juices and could not find one that I could stomach. If you don't mix a piece of fruit into these they can really be disgusting.
3,Raw Juices Can Save Your Life by Sandra Cabot,I thought that this book was good as far as the recipes are concerned. The book didn't give me as much info as I needed for my personal condition. I could have looked around for another type of book!
5,Magnificent Puzzle,"This is a beautiful puzzle. Not too easy and not terribly difficult. The pieces are brightly colored and the glow in the dark is just added fun. I gave it to a couple in Britain as a gift and they enjoyed it immensely. I was going to buy them a picture of New York but this was easier to fit in a suitcase, non-breakable and fun to do."
4,Good stuff,I love this product. I had gastro bypass surgery and needed the extra protein with very little sugar. Well I found what I needed in Designer whey. When I don't buy it online I go to the store it's worth the trip.
5,Great Bowls,These bowls are really great. I have been watching and learning about Fiesta for a long time. This was my first Fiestaware purchase. I will be getting more!!!
2,Surprised to find only one bowl!!,"Like a few of the other reviewers I was led to believe by the description of the bowls that I would be getting four, they must have reworded it in the meantime (perhaps because of complaints) because it now clearly states only one bowl and I'm sure it didn't before. Oh well so they say if it looks too good to be true it probably is."
1,What?,When I ordered this dvd I was thinking I was going to get a example of the military workout experience. What i got instead was part of an old series of military archives. Disappointed.
4,Melted Wax,"I love this little candel lantern. I hang it from my tent and it makes like a pourch lite when I'm about camp, but it does have a problem. As the candle burns some wax will run down the inside. This makes it hard at times to open and close the lantern; you have to disassemble it and scrape the wax off the glass. I may try the Bee's Wax and see if that helps."
2,Not for me,"Tiny and very unsafe feeling, though it's probably safer than just an open candle flame. It feels cheap and it get very, very hot."
3,Does the job,"MUCH smaller than I expected, smaller in diameter than a soda can. Seems like it would be dented very easily so I bought the cover for it."
5,Useful Product,"Living in an area where we have frequent power outages we do use candles occasionally - and these little lanterns are nice in that they shield the flame from draft so you don't have to worry about the candle going out when you're carrying it down a hall or the like. I also like the safety factor of the surrounded flame and with the UCO candles, we've kind of standardized on this as our power-out lighting solution. The hook can be used for hanging it in a handy location. All in all, it's not exactly a revolutionary product but it works and works well."
5,Refreshing.,"I'm finding that there are few solid female singers in the country genre that really catch my eye, make me want to listen more.I picked up this CD on the premise of having listened to Break Down Here. I wasn't disappointed. Each song is different, compelling, and beautifully sung. Her vocals are unique and refreshing. My favorites are 'Break Down Here', 'Rain On A Tin Roof', & 'The Chance'.Very good songwriting -- a great new talent in country."
3,A Nice Listen,"Overall, this CD is nice to listen to--smooth, sultry, emotive vocals paired with nice tunes and average lyrics. Even after listening to it several times though, it still hasn't hit me over the head or really impressed me. A few of the songs are really strong, a couple are skippable, and mostly they are just kind of there. Don't get me wrong, they're not bad, they just don't stir anything up inside me. Even though she has an emotive and bluesy vocal style, she doesn't evoke a strong emotional reaction in the listener--something that other artists in this bluesy country genre (e.g., Lucinda Williams) are able to do really well. If you only buy a few CDs a year, I wouldn't recommend this one; but if you buy lots of CDs, this is a nice addition to the collection. I think you will find it enjoyable, even if it's not earth shattering."
5,Self-Esteem Affirmations,This CD really changes your way of thinking for the positive. I use to watch t.v. before bed now I put on this CD and I'm relaxed and wake up feeling better about myself.
5,YEAH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I am new to Louise Hay starting with her You Can Heal Your Life Book. I read that gave it to my daughter to read. I saw this CD and bought it because of the subliminal side. I listen to it work and again when I go to sleep. My 10 year old son listens to it with me and now can't wait to go to sleep so he can play this CD. It's actually very sweet!!!!! I feel alot calmer now and my hair trigger temper has been calmed significantly. I can see a change in my son's behavior as well and I truly am thankful for that. I say buy it, and try it. I'm so glad I did."
2,Stories lack closure.,"Each story pulls the reader in from the start, but when the ending comes, there is no ending, no closure. It leaves the reader dissapointed, feeling that there is something missing. It's as if the second half of the story is missing. Despite the great pull these stories posess in the beginning, I wouldn't recommend wasting time getting involved with these stories. There is nothing to be gained, excpet dissapointment"
3,The author is trying to cover too much material,"A good reference book for HTML. You just cannot cover all HTML, CGI, PERl, JAVA, JavaScript....in one book, even with 1000++ pages. However, it's good one for users with solid Unix background and some programming experience."
3,It has flaws - but it is sound and covers alot of ground,"I'm surprised by the negativity of the reviews here. Yes, it has flaws. All Web books have flaws. With the fast dynamics of the Web world and the fact that with no standards everyone thinks everything should be done THEIR way it isn't surprising that there exist few GOOD books - yet.What I like most about the book is that it covers alot of ground. HTML (yes, the HTML *4* sections are poor but the good ol' basic 3.2 is covered well), CGI (yes, not *much* but enough for a start - wish there was more Perl though), how to organize a collection, defining graphics extensions and MIME types ... really alot for the serious beginer.My professional Web graphics person thought she did quite a good job on design principles and tips and I use it in the class I teach!"
3,All these bad reviews are written suspiciously alike,"I have browsed this book and have found it to be a decent reference guide to HTML. Not a dazzling style insight guide but a pretty complete command reference. Because of the comments listed here, I will be giving this title extra scrutiny but I am rather suspicious of these negative reviews because they all seem to be written in a very similar style with the same obscure criticisms. I hope the author of the other book isn't behind them."
2,"The Carol Burnett Show: Collector's Edition, Volumes 1-5",Each DVD has only two episodes of the show. Don't know if that is worth the cost.
1,Received Old Discontinued Model,"I rated 1 star but this is a ""0"" star review. DO NOT BUY THIS - says the manufacturer!Just received my new Germ Terminator today and noticed right away that the package shows toothbrushes inserted upside down. This caught my eye right away because when I was trying to decide which sanitizer to buy, I liked that this unit accepts the toothbrushes standing up rather than head down like all the other units. Consequently, when going thru the reviews I learned that the unit I received has been discontinued by the manufacturer and that they warn against purchasing/using one (the price did seem to be too good to be true). Fortunately, I never used the unit and it's going back tomorrow. I don't understand though, after other customers have told Amazon about this, why they're still being sold here! Shame on you, Amazon!! Oh, and thanks to those reviewers for the valuable info that saved me from potential grief."
1,Awful! Do Not Purchase!,First day it melted my toothbrush. Next day it started looking dark and unclean under my new toothbrush. 4th day it looked very dark and unclean under our toothbrushes. Tossed it in the trash. Total waste of money.
2,not so good,"After about a week of use, the heater element produced rust and turned the base of the bristles on the toothbrush a rustic color. This cant be healthy. Going to try an ultraviolet brush holder."
4,great product!!!,"I was looking for a toothbrush sanitizer, received this one about a month ago. It is much better than the battery operatedsanitizers. It takes up little space and it works perfectly. My previous (2) sanitizers were battery operated and did not lastvery long. Both eneded up with mildew inside which became disgusting after awhile. This product is great and efficient!!!"
1,FIRE,Product is dangerous. There is no automatic turn off when dried. The tooth brush is in danger of burning. We have had to throw away several toothbrushes because of this. It may kill germs but it destroys the toothbrush and there is always the fear of FIRE. Product was not fully thought through.
1,Not Worth Reading,Very negative book. Kept repeating same things over in different chapters. Seems like the facts stated kept changing. Book just didn't make sense.
1,Just reviewing the synopsis,"I was fired up to buy this book until I read in the synopsis that Dr. Breggin sites ""working mothers"" as one of the problems of our children today. Not working fathers or working parents; working mothers. As a working mother myself, I am sick unto death of getting hit with all the blame when TWO parents chose to work. I guess I save myself $17."
4,a bracing look at the feminist movement,"Women are turning into animals, and some animals are turning into women. Men fuss about what sort of status should be given to the new ""humans"", and doctors and psychologists are concerned with the prospect of a ""takeover"" of power and what this will all do to the institution of Motherhood, not to mention a man's privileges and rights. A thought-provoking, witty examination of the women's movement and society's reactions to it, this is a fun book to read that gives one a real feel for what it was like to live through the changes in women's roles in the 60's and 70's."
5,Great gift for the Whiskey lover in us all.,I don't necessarily agree with everything Jim Murray writes but it did give me a lot of interesting ideas for new and different whiskey's to try. His descriptions of the various whiskey's and whiskey's making are enough to make your mouth water.
5,True to Life Portrayal of an Abused Child,"I have worked in the child abuse field for over 15 years. I am from the area in which AJ was killed. I cannot tell you how true to form this book actually is. It tells the real story of a child who is abused yet overlooked in todays society. It makes many of us face the reality that we often find to hard to face. If only people could truly recognize that there are many children out there everyday that are enduring this same abuse and often worse. While sometimes graphic and difficult, this type of book is needed to alert people to the problems facing our children today. This goes beyond discipline, crossing the line. Something that most people, who do not abuse their children, rarely believes exists. My congratulations to the authors who had the courage to embark on such a tough project. Excellent!"
2,"Take it to the river, Leave it there!","Huge Al Green fan, yet greatly disappointed in this book. For some reason, I did not feel total truth and sincerity was put into writing this book. And who was the editor! The numerous typos only led to further frustration. I have always respected Al Green for who he was- the church boy gone secular who never lost his ability to interpret any tune with gospel fire and conviction. The Hollywood side of Al has always been visible- to everyone but himself- and it is still prevelant as I watch him on numerous television events singing his hits of old. I was not fascinated by this read and I would suggest that you borrow this book from the library or a friend before making the purchase."
3,Repetitious,"This book had some very good parts, with lots of useful information. However, there were many things that were just repeated over and over throughout most of the book. It was a struggle for me to stick with it and push through to the end."
2,"Considered a classic, but it's very repetitive...","It's a good book, it obviously has an important theme about men and women getting along. The book however, pounds the same concepts into your head over-and-over again. The book can be summerized in one sentence: ""When women need to talk, let them vent, and when guys want to be alone, give them their ""batcave"" time in their den or study..."""
3,Must read but with major ommisions,"Yes he comes across as having a huge ego and the rolling of eyes is appropriate and you need to take the advice with a pinch of salt. Having said that it's a must read for both sexes. The one thing the author barely touches on is the major omission in this book. There are lots of very common, real problems that individuals bring to the table in a relationship. This book does not solve them and they can sabotage successful communication. Gray would do his readers a huge service if he put his ego aside for a minute and stopped pretending that the advice in this book will solve all problems it won't. He should offer some pointers on the major common problems outside the scope of this book and where to look for answers. Two emotionally healthy people who want to communicate better will find this book a must read. The unabridged audio book is very good."
2,Really? His PhD is no longer valued,"First and foremost, this author has been married several times. He clearly has know clue about making things last. Finally, his university where he obtained a PhD is no longer accredited. That says a lot about him and the information in this book. Life does not have a one fit all solution. We are better of taking information from someone who practices what they preach."
5,Men are from Mars,Should be required reading for all men and women who are trying to build relationships!
3,We are not all that different.,"John gives an example of a man who washes the dishes for the wife's birthday and instead of getting a thank you, he gets negative criticism, because he does them so rarely he don't know how to do them. After the negative criticism the man never wants to dishes again.I don't see any Difference when a woman changes the oil in the car as a surprise and does not change the oil filter and drains the oil in the red oil pan (which is his parts cleaning pan). While the oil drain pan is hidden under the work bench, cause its dirty. She is going to get negative criticism too and it will be the last time she changes oil.I did learn something about myself, If I don't get a positive reward, I will not clean.Save your money and read ""The Gospel of Timothy"" instead."
4,I never knew!,"I bought this audio because one of the Elders at my church suggested it as a good resource. After 19 years of marriage I had no idea how to listen to my wife. Now that I know, I hope I can apply it. I recommend this to ALL married couples, engaged couples, and singles. The simple principles are very insightful."
1,Popcorn self help,"The one good thing about this book is that it is well organized. It is poorly written and low in substance. It left me feeling that the author understands neither gender more than a lay person. Its popularity, in my view, makes it a marketing masterpiece."
4,Great littel advice book!,I had purchased this book for myself and I really got a lot from it. It's a great book and helped me to understand many things about men and myself as well. I wanted to share this with a friend who is getting married and having trouble communicating with her fiance. I believe this book will help them both to have a much stronger relationship.
2,"Overrated fluff by a phony ""PhD""","I was very disappointed after reading the book I've heard so much hype about. I found it full of ridiculously broad generalities and stereotypes. Although there are a few nuggets of truth in the book, the majority of it is pop psychology at its worst.I read this book over a year ago, and didn't care for it then. I like it even less since discovering that John Gray's ""PhD"" so proudly flaunted on the cover comes from Columbia Pacific University, a diploma-by-mail mill which was shut down by the California Department of Consumer Affairs. (Look it up for yourself on the web.)All in all, I'm very disappointed with this book, its author, and the media attention it has received. There are far better books on relationships available, written by people who earned their credentials instead of buying them. Don't bother with this one."
2,I hated this book.,"When I first began reading this book, it seemed alright, and to offer some helpful advice. (I was reading it for my college freshmen writing class) Now that I've finished it, I just wanted to say that I really don't like this book, I found it ridiculously sexist, and the author tends to be repetitive in what he says. I would not recommend this book to anyone."
3,mediocre at best,"An appalling exhibition of blatant mediocrity, this chaotic clutter of bombastic solipsism would best be left where it is found."
2,Don't buy the hard cover,"The book has 4-5 good ideas which you could easily pick out by scanning at the bookstore. If you don't have the time for that, or don't have the opportunity at a friend's house, the cheapest soft cover you can find is all I would recommend.If you want a relationship book with some meat in it, pick up one of the books by Doug & Naomi Moseley (DANCING IN THE DARK is my favorite). Also, CONSCIOUS LOVING by Gay and Hendricks ranks among the best."
2,Read Susan Hamson's Counterpoint!,"Some readers claim that John Gray has helped save their marriage. Others argue that his views are shallow, sexist and condescending to women.One certainty is that there is no way that John Gray's book(s) can be fully appreciated without reading Susan Hamson's informative (and at times scathing) counterpoint.This can be achieved by visiting her website, creatively titled ""The Rebuttal from Uranus"" < or by reading her views along side Gray's in ""Taking Sides: Clashing Views on Controversial Issues in Human Sexuality,"" edited by Robert T. Francoeur and William J. Taverner.Bill TavernerTaking Sides: Clashing Views on Controversial Issues in Human Sexuality"
2,Repetative and Condescending,"I already new 90% of what was discussed in this book, just from being aware of what goes on around me. You can see it demonstrated live just by watching Home Improvement. I found myself becoming irritated at the style and voice the author used to convey his points and kept saying ""get to the meat."" But then, if he had, the book would be a pamphlet. A serious waste of money."
2,A Bit of Equality If You Please,"There was really nothing in this book that common sense doesn't already tell you. I found nothing new that hadn't already been discussed in other books and the repetitiveness caused me to skim pages after a while.What I also got annoyed about was the ""changes"" required. ""Don't intrude when your man is in his cave"" ""Wait until he's come out before talking."" rar rar. What about women? ""Men have to listen."" I mean geez louise. Big deal. Doesn't matter if we're upset or need support. As long as we don't upset the men while they're in their cave everything is fine. BAH. Are we back in the 1950's?The 2 stars were given for the section describing love letters. That was about the only part that the repetitiveness was in any way bearable."
5,ENG 106,"This book is very insightful. As a guy I always asked myself why are we so different from women and how can we come to a middle point. The truth is that the great writer is able to explain in simple words how we come from two different planets. We men look at things from other angles than women do. While women need to feel loved and needed when they are under emotional distress, men actually would love to lock themselves out in an attic until they figure out their problems and how to resolve them. If a woman looks at this situation she will feel left out and unloved while the truth is that it is not personal. Moreover, John Gray goes further to give you tips on how to diminished this differences and make it work.Alberto Colmenares"
5,Say it ain't necessarily so,"It's too bad that a book of this nature is necessary.What sense does it make that the two sexes speak two entirely different languages?Actually, it makes no sense whatsoever, yet it's true.However, when you think about it, a book has to be written, on whatever subject, by either one sex or the other, since there are only the two sexes, right?So how can one sex write about a subject that he can't possibly comprehend, inasmuch as he is the wrong sex to write about it?What a diabolical situation, created by the Mastermind of Creation, to forever confound us mere mortals.But, we have to trust that two minds (one male, one female) collaborated on this subject, so as to enlighten the decidedly unenlightened vast majority, so that we may endeavor to understand one another, although I still feel that it is an impossible task.I mean, try as he may, will any man ever understand any woman?I don't think so."
4,Wonderful portrayal of gender thinking differences,"I read this book, when I am feeling that I am not understanding my spouse. What a relief. when ever I try to help my wife, she used to get angry , that used to upset. Author nicely explains with simple examples how to diffuse this type of situations with 'Men - No fixing only validation, women - No critcism with a hope to helping '. Like this there are hundreads of techniques. There are hundreads of tips like that in this book. When I tried to explain people, some people are not open to change, even resistant to listen. Except this book it is highly informative."
3,Doesnt live up to its hype,"I believe the reason this book became such a success is because it has a catchy title, not because of what it says. Afterall, hasnt this guy been married a few times? I like a book with less ""discussion"" and more action. The Romantic's Guide is a great book for living a good relationship, not just pondering about it. Pure and Simple is another good title along those lines."
5,Uranus,"Taking another reviewer's suggestion, I read Hamson's ""Rebuttal from Uranus"" in ""Taking Sides"" by Francoeur and Taverner.Uranus makes a lot more sense than Mars and Venus."
1,a tacky little book by a tiny little man,"After wasting three hours of my life reading this reprehensible exercise in stereotypical thinking (not to mention poor writing), it's easy to see why John Gray would think of women as being from another planet: it's clear that he's completely in the dark when it comes to dealing with anyone in a mature, open-minded fashion without relying on juvenile metaphors and 50s sit-com solutions. YIKES!!!! Personally, I think John Gray is one of the horsemen of the apocalypse. And not in a good way, either."
2,not really!,"WELL! this book is not excately what i expected.the author keeps repeating himself, not only his ideas but even the phrases as well! he keeps going on in circles..which only weakens the point. a chapter of 20 pages or so just keeps repeating one simple idea it is like he wanted to make sure we memorized the whole book before we put it down which is kinda annoying!while reading it i felt the author saying ''ok! repeat after me..''!to be fare the book got some helpful ideas and a psycological analaysis which is not bad. but the book is like saying something in 180 pages while u can sum it in five simple words!"
5,Inspirational!,"This book is full of beautiful full-color patterns for long and short needlecases and even has some beautiful pictures of the the finished products, including gorgeous amulet bags. It has certainly inspired me as a new beader to create a few of these for friends and family (and don't forget...myself). If you know how to read a bead pattern then this book is for you. It doesnt come with instructions so I would say you need to have some prior knowledge of reading patterns before you start with this book. For the 'advanced' beginner to the expert beader."
1,disapointment!,"The book itself is a great book!!! I read it while I was pregnant and it helped me greatly on the preperation for labor and giving birth itself. My disapointment was when I received the book, which was supposed to be in ""good"" condition, and that the book is torn through all the pages! What a good condition when you can't even read it!"
4,it's a winner!,"This was a great gift for my one year old busy boy. He loves to push it, sit on it, push it over & stand on it and finally, turn it completely over and use it as a slide & ladder. As he rotates around the room, he always comes back to this. The little ""controls"" make clicking noises & occupy even this very busy one for a while. Great buy, great gift."
3,I prefer the Bubble Mower,"I ordered this for my daughter and nephew for Christmas. When my older kids were young, we went through 2 Fisher Price Bubble Mowers (the first was a garage sale toy). I decided to order this one since it didn't use bubbles and I was worried about the mess my big kids would make since they are now old enough to use the bubble part (we never used it before). My daughter plays with it some but she doesn't enjoy it nearly as much as her older siblings did-it's bigger and heavier so she has a harder time manuvering it. In hind-site, I would order the Bubble Mower and just not use the bubble part-it seems to be more fun for the little ones."
3,Okay toy for good walkers.,"I got this for my son when he was 9 months old and just barely starting to walk. He didn't like it until now (he's 11 months old) because he can walk really well now and doesn't need to hold onto anything for support. If your child isn't walking well, they will fall over backward thinking the handle will support them. Once the child is walking well enough on their own, it's a pretty nice toy. My son just now discovered the lever and key and likes to play with those and he likes to flip the whole thing over and look underneath...it's very light and easy to maneuver. Overall an okay toy."
3,"The noise can be ""turned off""","Our son got this for his first birthay. He can't walk yet, but is very happy pushing the mower with our help. Unfortunately, after some time he gets too frustrated with it because he pushes the handle down and probably doesn't want the mower to fall but it does, of course.Anyway, we thought that the noise is bothering him (was certanly bothering us), so we unscrewed all the screws and removed the balls and the springs that are to blame for the noises. Now the toy is very quiet but still frustrating for our son :) He is below the recomended age so we'll try introducing it again in 5 months."
1,Guess I'm the lone dissenting opinion,"I bought this mower for my son's first birthday after reading all the great reviews here. It was very disappointing. My baby has absolutely zero interest in it, but I was disappointed even before showing it to him. It sounded so neat in the reviews, but it's just a cheap piece of plastic junk. I can't understand why it is so darn expensive! Ditto to the reviewer who wrote that it cannot be used as a walker. Unless you have a VERY proficient walking child, your baby is going to fall on top of this mower because it is extremely lightweight. It did nothing to hold my baby's interest. I'm going to keep it around for another week and if he still isn't interested, it goes bye-bye!"
1,WARNING - SAFETY HAZZARD!,My one year old daughter was playing with this mower when it flipped out from under her because of the light weight on the handle. She now has a broken forearm and a cast for 6 weeks right before Christmas!This toy should have warnings all over it about the tendancy to flip upside down with children trying to hang on to it. Please be careful and spare yourself the grief that we are gowing through.
4,Better than some of the others,"We received this toy from a neighbor. My two year old daughter really enjoys it. We compared this to the bubble making lawn mower toy and the playskool one and found this Mulching Mower more durable, less likely to tip backwards and of course, with no messy bubbles, better for parents and clean up. The popping noise is not annoying like I thought it would be (like that popcorn push toy is), so overall it is a good toy for boys or girls."
5,I can't believe I am the first person to review this for you,"I use this tape at the start and end of my day regularly. On the days that I don't listen, my day just doesn't go as smoothly, and I don't fall asleep as easily. Louise Hay has a very reassuring voice and calm manner. I gave my first copy to my brother,(he is fighting cancer right now) so, I came here to replace it. This tape can be enjoyable and useful to anybody, no matter how deep their interest in meta-physics, new age, or meditation."
5,message still relevant for today,"this book is a little dated, but it is so true still. I bought the book for my daughter's to read. Want them to be well versed vs. their mom growing up. More information to this younger generation, and I am glad!"
1,My girl friend dumped me for this?????,"I find it apalling that any self-respecting woman could read this book and then have the audacity to call it ""empowering"" or ""brilliant"". I had a good idea of the book's content even before I read it. This idea was due soley to the fact that my girlfriend of 2 years suddenly ended the relationship, claiming that she had read a book that gave her a knew perspective. I had no idea that the perspective she spoke of was one so cold, heartless, and radical. Some might say that maybe I'm just one of those abusive thugs in Dr. Laura's book, and I probably deserived whatever heartbreak I recieved. I can assure you with every ounce of moral fiber in my being that I would never be abusive to any woman, for any reason, especially one I felt so strongly for. My advice to all those who wish to read this book, is to stay far from it, if you have any feelings for your significant other at all, stay far far away from it."
5,Excellent!!!!,Thank you for your prompt and courteous attention to our order. The book was received ahead of expected due date and was in excellent condition. Again thank you very much.
1,Don't waste your money,"I'm torn between flaming this book for how ignorant it is and laughing at how ridiculous it is.Really, don't waste your time or money."
3,Not as good as I remembered,"I watched this DVD having already seen it some years ago. It definitely lost something on the second viewing, perhaps because all of the twists of the plot were known. The animation is somewhat primitive by todays standards, comparable to the old Voltron series, but still good. The movie seemed to drag and did not keep my interest. I would recommend this as a rental for those who have not seen it, but not to buy for repeated viewing."
3,A Little Over-produced,"I tend to like hearing the actual choir. I know it was the choir, but it is so perfect as to be absurd. I find I am really unable to listen to it because it is so focused on the purity of sound rather than musicality and expression."
4,music for the spirit,A testament to the beauty that exists in this world. Disciplined and well-constructed collection of good music. Recommended.
1,Bad Performance - Merlin RO system,"I installed a GE Merlin RO system couple weeks ago. It gave me several difficulties and problems. One of the major problems was the total dissolved solid (TDS) from the product/outlet could not meet the requirements per their specification even thought I flushed the system over 24 hours during the initial setup. Another problem was the drain connection elbow caused water leak. I tried to call the dealer and found a way to return the product. However, they told me that I used the system and that means I owned the system. In other words, I could not return the product. I was very disappointed their service and response. Also their installation manual description does not provide clear installation instruction, such as which direction to install the RO membranes and manifold connection direction. Therefore, I rated it as a POOR product."
3,Not bad at all for Poverty Row!,"I've wanted to see this little B flick from Tiffany Pictures (a remake of an earlier silent version by the way) ever since I read about it in the Turner/Price book ""Forgotten Horrors"". It's pretty damn good! Read ""Laughing Gravy""'s review here for plot synopsis and his assessment and I totally agree with him there. The only negative is it looks like it was sourced from low quality video, rather than a film print (and the orginal print is in pretty bad shape to begin with), typical for Alpha. It doesn't look any better than a VHS tape copy but until Roan or somebody does it better, this one is well worth the cheap price!"
3,This is a re-issue of 'Voltar Pro Rio',"Today I almost bought this release, thinking it was new, but am glad I did not since I already own it.This release is a re-issue of 'Voltar Pro Rio'.You can probably buy the old one for $3 used and save $12.The CD is worth the $6 I paid for just one track:Nana das Aguas - it is a brilliant composition and performance (covered also, quite brilliantly, by Kevyn Lettau on her own CD).The rest of the CD is rather mediocre songwriting although the production and performance overall is quite good.I only listen to the one track but if you don't have any Ivan Lins or Sergio Mendes CD's or Dori Caymmi or many other superior works to listen to, you might enjoy this CD.Buy it for Nana das Aguas alone and you will not be disappointed."
1,DataPilot Stinks!,"I am extremely disappointed with this product! I just installed DataPilot and used it to transfer numbers from my laptop to my phone. Unfortunately, what SusTeen's marketing BS never tells you is that the product strips out all the additional stuff your specific phone uses before it writes it back to your phone. So in my particular case, I lost all the voice recognition data assigned to each phone number. Not to mention, it does not accept special characters for ""pause"" or ""wait"" used to access voicemail. Now I am forced to go back and reedit all my numbers. This product is supposed to save you time and make it easier to manager your phone data, but all it did for me was make more work!"
5,It's a cable; it works,"I bought this cable because I needed a way to connect my television to my speaker system. (I had a variety of cables that would let it connect to my various other devices, but, ironically, nothing for just plain RCA connections.) Despite the proximity of over nine other electronic devices along the path of the cable, including several that use wireless communication, I've never heard any interference in the sound, and the signal seems crisp and clear with solid connections.No reservations about it; if you need a six-foot audio cable, might as well grab this one."
1,defective,very disappointed because it is a sony. Needs a new battery every other day. This product does not work. I was so sure it was goint to be great that I throw away the packaging and I cannot return it now. It is worthless.
2,Will not play burnded CDs,"In spite of its claims this device rarely plays a burned CD as claimed. I have tried various brands of CDs and various rip and burn programs yet most CDs won't play. The controls are poorly designed, it's display window difficult to view, and the sound is at best, adequate. Finally, in what is a truly irritating feature, when playing a CD that was stopped before completion, the machine goes back to that spot no matter how many other CDs have been played. Do yourself a favor and skip DEJ011."
2,"Good sound, but will destroy your CD's as time passes.","It's not the toughest. It can easily break on you, but you can kind of tell as soon as you get it so I was careful with it. If you treat it right it WILL last a long time as mine has. Wish I could say the same for the CD's you put in it. It scratches up all of my CD's to a point where they eventually become unplayable. I know that all players cause a little bit of scratching, but this one takes the cake."
1,REALLY Disappointed,We are real Sony fans but this CD player surely didn't do it for us! It only lasted four months and then gave out! HOW disappointing! I will surely not buy another one and will never recommend it to anyone either!
4,Sony DEJ011 CD Walkman Portable CD Player,The item came within 7 days. It was used but works GREAT. My mother-in-law has been using it and enjoying it since Christmas. Thanks to all for getting this quality product to me so quickly!
3,Does NOT play MP3,"This is an OK portable CD player, but ...I give Amazon a rating of ZERO. In the techinical details, it explicitly says it will play MP3 files. IT DOES NOT!!!! Why the heck would anyone omit the playing of MP3 anyway?? Why is Amazon so incredibly sloppy about the desciption of the items it sells?"
1,Awful,"I thought when I ordered a Sony I'd be getting quality. Ha!The buttons (to turn on/0ff... regulate volume, etc ARE SO SMALL YOU NEED A MAGNIFYING GLASS.I know most people are not buying this item, but if SONY still makes it, why not makea device where the control panel is readable?Very disappointing.Ry c."
4,"very solid unit, takes a tweek to make it hifi","Hard-to-see controls, but i put some fine permanent marker on the top bevel to get over that. With real hifi headphones, the high-end was really missing. I found out from the fine print you have to disable the bump-protection to recover the hghest frequencies. Sounds great now. It's just kind of quirky to have that buried in the small print. This player's been great with those adjustments. Most players are messed up soon after purchase. It's worth a little more for a Sony, I think. Might be nice to have something even finer for another $10-20."
4,Good Value for the Money,"So far we have not had any problems with the unit, it operates as expected. It was a gift to my mother in law but she has never said anything negative about it, and she appreciates being able to listed to her audio books on CD's anywhere she goes. The package arrived in a timeley manner and in good shape."
4,Great CD player!,"I had nothing but a postive experience with this seller and this item. SONY made a great product with the player, although I had my own headphones I didnt need the ones that came with it, but I could always use them at a later time. GREAT PRODUCT, GREAT PRICE, and RAPID DELIVERY. A++"
1,Not worth the high price,"I burn and listen to a lot of CDs, so I invested in this (bought new, full price) in September 08 thinking it would last a long time and I'd be able to listen to a lot of burned CDs on it. Today, for no reason, it no longer plays burned CDs AT ALL -- just the motor whirring and a ""no disk"" message. I know a little bit about electronics so I thought the Sony brand name was a good investment. I'm really annoyed I paid $40 for something that lasted less than six months! I'm not going to buy any more new expensive CD Walkman players, and especially not Sony."
2,Short lived product,"Judging from many of the one star reviews, I guess I'm lucky. I've had this CD player for about a year. Never used it for walking, just for playing music at bed time. I've always used the adapter. Had problems from the start with it making so much noise that I had to put it under a pillow so I could hear the music. Also had problems with it stopping for no apparent reason. Now it's refuses to work at all using the adapter. I, too, thought Sony would be a great product. Oh well..."
4,Beware!,"These panties are soft and comfy but they are NOT 100% COTTON! There is spandex to provide stretch. Therefore, if you are concerned about breathe-ability they are probably not for you."
5,Off the hook,"This multilayered novel rooted in the lives of gay Black men is off the hook. There are so many affirming, sad, tragic, hopeful messages that it's hard to beleive they could all exist in one book. I think of this book as a major wake-up call. In addition, there is a super surprise ending!!!"
4,Deep and Real,"I started reading this book slow (a chapter a day), but as the story line thicken, I could not put it down. The writing was great and the characters where real. I recommend this book to all."
3,I've had better fake poop in my day,"This poop is just ok. It's kind of a shiny poop, so it looks fresh when placed, however it has a bit of a curve to the bottom of it, so it does not sit flat on any surface. That being said, it is kind of small caliber for a human turd. It is more like a cat poop. And I don't know about you, but my cat does not like the toilet. Perhaps it could pass for a child's poop. But it still doesn't sit right if you try to balance it on the toilet seat. Maybe if you put it on a pillow or in a hot dog bun it would be more realistic. It just smells like plastic, not like poop at all. If you want real poop smell you would need to get some fart spray or spoiled broccoli."
3,Inexpensively built,"This product is functional, but. Cheaply built with chincy plastic pieces that don't fit well. I thought it was to bw all wooden. It is okay, but chincy."
3,hopeful,"from the reviews I've read, this sounds like a lower grade product from what I had previously. I hope not. So much easier to play if you're not chasing marbles all over the house."
2,At Best a Fair Try,"George Winston is a magnificent pianist, but you should pass on this one. I'm not sure whether most of the particular songs selected for this CD don't fit his style or whether the arrangements of the pieces are flawed, but there is little of interest here. Try his other works and see how much better he is than here. It's precisely because his other work is so much better that I only gave this two stars."
2,"George, why did you move into the elavator?","I'm very disappointed. There has been no greater fan of George Winston than I. I have all of his music, so of course I bought this one the moment I saw it. One cannot get past the freaky Musak feeling you get in JcPenny's singing along to a sixties Beatles tune but it's in a quasi classical format. It's like a sell out of the Winston personal style. There is a reason I don't tune into the ""Smooth Jazz"" stations, it's the same thing. Take a song and shove it into the style you want to hear. Admittedly George has used other's songs before, but they fit. I think I'll just put ""Forest"" in the player and shelve this one, it stinks!"
5,Consistently Excellent Cusco Material,"One of the only complaints I've had with past Cusco efforts has been that they have a few excellent songs and the rest are very unextraordinary. However, Apurimac III is filled with excellent songs that explore the same soundscapes. If you liked Apurimac II, you'll love Apurimac III."
2,Apurimac III,"I was disappointed with this one. I even listened to the samples. Had to do a double take just to see if the disc matched the cover. This one was just not for me. I thought the samples were really good. Maybe the music on the disc should be 30 seconds long, jut enough to make one think they like it."
5,YESS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This album makes my spirit soar!!!!!!!!!(Ghost Dance is my favorite one.)
5,Julie,"A creative, child friendly tale that should help any child suffering from vision problems have a better understanding of his/her situation. Beautifully illustrated and fun to read. I've recommended this book to several parents. My entire family enjoyed sharing this book together."
2,It's not necessarily better the second time around...,"If you want real edge and literature, try the original -- which , after reading this book, would have to be confirmed as the better of the two -- Diary of a Mad Housewife, by Sue Kaufman. It was a superlative book, very compelling and unique in its voice, and it stands up well to time. As to the recent trend of fiction with engagement as its topic ( as well as motherhood ), look to Suzanne Finnamore (Otherwise Engaged, The Zygote Chronicles) or Jennifer Weiner, (Good in Bed, In Her Shoes) who at least can write their way out of a wedding dress."
4,"Frontier dresses, children's tiara's, $400 shoes...OH MY!!!","Laura Wolf's 'DIARY OF A MAD BRIDE' catalogs the count down to Amy Thomas' big day and all of the craziness that ensues before hand. Beginning with Amy being a bridesmaid in one of her best friends wedding and swearing that if she ever got married she would not become a ""bridezilla"" as her friend had. The reader watches as Amy go from a level headed bride-to-be to an almost crazed ""bridezilla"" herself!Wolf has written a hilarious account of how stressful planing a wedding can actually be. I laughed out loud numerous times and definitely recommend this book for anyone currently planning a wedding (surely you could use a laugh to de-stress a bit). Also, for all of you brides-to-be, this would make a great tag along gift for your loyal bridesmaids who've stuck with you throughout all the stages of planning and barely avoided any of your phone calls!"
2,Bride-to-be disliked this book,"I bought this book about 5 months before my wedding this summer hoping for some humor to keep me going through the wedding planning process. Instead I got a book about a woman who keeps getting more and more ridiculous - to the point where I no longer felt sorry for her. While bridal insanity may happen to a lot of people (myself included), the author takes the story way too far over the top in an attempt to funny. Instead of reading the book and laughing at the characters (and thus myself), by the end I was sick of the main character and all of the book's contrived predicaments.This was not a terrible book, and it was a very quick read. I just think it could have been much better. If you are curious I recommend checking it out from local library."
5,Laugh out loud funny!,"This book was so funny for any woman who has been in a wedding, planned a wedding or attending friends weddings. You will laugh out loud funny from this book and be looking for more when you are through!"
4,Very Funny!!,"This book was absolutely hilarious!! I picked it up seeking a funny, light, enjoyable read after some of the heavier themed books I've finished, and I sure found it!This book zips right along, formatted as diary entries of Amy Thomas, whose friends it seems are all getting married, and going crazy. Amy vows never to become a crazy, delusional bride-to-be. But when Stephen her boyfriend proposes to her, things quickly start spinning out of control. Before she knows what's happening, she's second guessing her antique engagement ring, the way Stephen proposed, her wedding dress, and fighting in public about her bridal flowers!As soon I finished this book I IMMEDIATELY picked up the next one, Diary of a Mad Mother-To-Be, and am half-way through already. I highly recommend this book, it's fast-paced and VERY funny! A great book for future brides, married women, or anyone even remotely interested in weddings!"
4,Great Read,"This is a simple and very funny, book for every bride. But, read it after the wedding - maybe on the honeymoon - because all the lists may stress you out."
3,Bridget Jones' Diary for Brides-to-Be,"Thanks to the success of the diary format in such diverse places as ""Bridget Jones' Diary"" and online journals, the diary format has been used almost to excess in fiction. However, this book is a bit different. For one, the only real thing about this book that tells you it's a diary (besides the title) is the fact that it has dates. It is not written as though Amy (the ""mad bride"" of the title) is writing to her diary, it reads more like a normal fiction book, with the exception of dialogue reading as lines from a movie or play. That being said, this is an interesting book, with occasional flashes of humor, but only one real laugh-out-loud moment that I can remember. As I appreciate humor, I tend to judge books such as this by the number of laugh-out-loud moments it has. It has some slight plot twists, but not the ones you would predict. Overall, it's an interesting and diverting read, but of this particular genre, I've read much better."
4,Awesome Program-Short Review,"I can not validate of course the truthfulness of this series, as other people have pointed out. But I don't think thats my job as I'm reviewing it as entertainment and as a series. As far as that goes, it was great, as many other people have pointed out. I feel thats already been covered, so I wanted to point out, this DVD is not enhanced for 16X9. Anamorphic Widescreen is not part of this, so one will have to stretch the image, losing some resolution. On my TV, it looked like poo. This of course is a technical aspect of the dvd, and not the movie, but I thought it was worth mentioning. Therefore, I give it four stars. Just be warned.-X"
3,Where can a guy a go?,Halo has headed to China too! Where can a guy go to find a lighting fixture that isn't?
3,Good speaker but has limits,I have this unit as well as the 900 Mhz stereo pair and have good performance. Unfortunatly I have aluminum siding and low-e windows (fine metal coating) so I had to move my transmitter close to an outside wall to get acceptable performance for my outside speaker. The inside speakers work well but have some popping. I believe this is from a cordless phone which shares the 900 Mhz spectrum.
3,"Not great, but okay for the price!","The speaker is a little tricky to tune in and keep tuned in, and it tends to crackle due to interference (like someone walking by it). Not great sound quality, but okay for the price paid."
1,Works for .5 secs,"I read many of the poor reviews and was wary, but for the discounted price, figured what the heck.The first one I received I followed the instructions closely and when turning on the speaker, heard a little static, adjusted the tuner knob, heard the transmitted music....for .5 secs or so, then nothing.....ever again. I never even heard the static. I tried various things to get it working but to no avail. I returned it(very easy to return with amazon by the way) and received another quickly. It did exactly the same thing. Two poor products is two too many, so I asked for a refund. I'm now looking at other wireless outdoor speakers.You get what you pay for I guess."
2,Prone to Interference,"Looks and sounds great however it tends to ""drift"" once in a while accompanied by a loud hissing. Woke me up several times. Not for a bedroom."
1,Don't Throw Out the Packaging,"This wireless speaker system is practically useless. Multiple attempts at tuning, placement, retuning, both speaker and transmitter only resulted in increasing frustration. Static was constant. And this was while using the batteries. It didn't work at all while plugged into the AC. If I had not discarded the packaging it came in, it would have been the first return I made to Amazon. However, I didn't return the speaker system and doubt that I will ever use it. The Advent AW810 900 MHz Wireless Indoor/Outdoor Speaker System isn't worth five bucks. Buyer beware."
1,Would not reccomend this product.,"I had two of these units and both failed within a very short amount of time. The units would power on, but no power was getting to the speaker. I had to return them both. I ened up buying wired speakers and couldn't be happier. It takes a little more work, but you will be glad you did. Stay away from these!"
1,Product did not function,"Transmitter worked, but no power on the speaker. I contacted the tech support people at Advent, no luck. I decided to return it and buy another brand when I looked at the problems others have had.Amazon is good about taking returns if items are defective so no complaints there, just wish it had worked."
1,Never got it to work,"Unpacked it, read the entire instruction booklet, followed the step by step procedure. Got the red light blinking on the transmitter, not too fast, not too slow. Moved on to setting up the speaker. Got a green light there and a little static for a moment, then nothing. I couldn't get a single peep out if it. I tried every possible adjustment, tried a headphone jack, tried the rca plug. Never, ever got it to work, I'm very disappointed with this product and am returning it tomorrow."
1,Don't waste your time and money!!,I should have read the reviews before I ordered this piece of JUNK! I followed the directions to the letter and got sound from the unit for about 20 seconds.... then nothing. Called the technical support number and was basically told the items was junk. I sure am glad that amazon.com stands behind the items they sell. Just not sure why a reputable company like amazon.com continues to sell this item.....
1,Dead on Arrival,This product was Dead on Arrival.No amount of messing with cables oradapters or settings would get it to work.At least I got a full refund from Amazon...
2,Ambico VHS Rewinder,"I didn't LIke this product that much, every once in awhile It tangles part of the tape."
5,"Amazing CD, but...","... it wasn't what I expected of the dj Rafe Gomez, who's better known for mixes of uptempo jazz than chillout/laidback stuff. For a taste of what really makes this guy stand out, check out the mixes on his Web site - http://www.thegrooveboutique.com/sounds.php. They're free and they're around one hour each. You need REal Player to hear them. Don't get me wrong, I'm really getting into this album. But if you're in the mood to feel the beat rather than pour the vino, the online mixes are what you're looking for."
4,Very cool,"I would buy this album. Much better bought in a collection than buy itself. Its pretty smooth and awesome for roadtrip, quiet night at home, or have-friends-over mood music.Would buy again and may have to since somebody stole it!"
1,So tired of the same old gender stereotypes,"Well, this is a 'must-have' if you want confirmation of the prejudices you hold about how men and women behave. Here we go with the 'women are subjective and caring' and 'men are objective and task-orientated' tush yet again. If that is the case then my husband and I must be aliens because we behave in opposite ways to that which is described in this book. For all those who truly want to know how the men or women in their lives think, I've one piece of advice - ask them! Because we are all individuals with our own genetic make-up and histories and, believe it or not, we do not always act according to our gender script."
1,Written by a murderer,It's unbelievable to me that this book is still available. Ms. Hazzard was one of many early 20th century quacks who sold various kinds of fake cures. She specialized in luring people to her sanitarium and starving them to death. See http://www.crimelibrary.com/serial_killers/weird/doctors/11.html?sect=3 for details.
2,This blows,"I purchased two of these remotes to replace what we had. The model number is the same, but the performance blows.Unfortunately I tossed the old remotes after reading rave reviews for this model.The range is almost non-existent. The remotes work fine if we are within five feet of the garage door!"
2,Poor Quality,I'm very disappointed with Ichigo's figure. It doesn't look great like the picture shown in Amazon.The quality is bad. The paint is poorly colored and stained in many parts. The details of face & body are not well made.What a waste of money for a collector fan like me. I'd return it if it wouldn't cost me double what I've lost now.
2,DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK,"I have to say that I was extremely disappointed by this examiniation review book. Each chapter basically contains pages and pages of lists - and THAT IS ALL....if I needed a list of the rotator cuff muscles or the cranial nerves I could just as easily consult my anatomy text thank you. This review boasts 6 practice examinations, but once you have taken one of them, you have pretty much taken them all....why???...because she repeats the same questions over and over, even WITHIN THE SAME TEST!!!! This book is very poorly written and shows an overall lack of effort on the author's part. A friend who graduated a few years ago showed me his copy (a previous edition) and guess what - it included the exact same practice tests as well...looks like Ms. Meyer has been repackaging the same review book for years with no changes. Thanks for nothing....If you want a REAL examination review, do the online review offered by the FSBPT...the same people who create the test...."
3,Poor Discription,Product has worked fine so far but the description didn't state there were two in the package? So now I have four instead of two. Not worth the expense to return ...
5,Terhune's Real Tales of Real Dogs: The Best!,"My favorite book of all time is Albert Payson Terhune's ""Real Tales of Real Dogs."" I am a huge dog-lover and a pretty good copy of the book was given to me by my former boss at Newport Books, a rare bookstore in Newport, RI. Years later I lent the book to someone who lost it! I was so upset, looking high and low for a new one, losing bids on e-bay, even finding a seller I paid for the book but then his cellar was flooded and the book was ruined. I finally found a seller through Amazon who advertised the book at a reasonable price. When the book finally arrived in the mail, it was like meeting up with an old friend. It was in excellent condition, even better looking than my original book, and I have it on display in my home along with my other books by Terhune. But this is by far the most beautiful. I'll never lend it out again!"
1,kindle edition,"Based on the preview beamed out to my kindle, the pages of this graphic novel are much too small to read. Changing the font size on the kindle does not alter the size of the image at all. If this is not a problem once one has purchased the kindle edition, please pass the word along."
4,Did the trick,"My optical mouse has been driving me crazy with its erratic motion. I wanted a nice, inexpensive mousepad that would make things better. This did the trick nicely. Nothing fancy; just does exactly what it's supposed to!"
1,Only a SIMULATED mouse pad,"It looks like a good mouse pad with a black rubber backing, but NO NO NO it's not. It is light as a feather and made of lightweight black foam so it will skid all around your desk. I returned them for some better ones that have the standard heavy rubber backing. Stay away from this cheap product that only SIMULATES a mouse pad. The low price should clue you in. Good pads cost $5 to $6."
2,Lousy grip,This item is a real cheapo. After about a dozen times of running the mouse over the same place on the pad the grip no longerworks. It works hardly any better than having no mouse pad at all.
1,Sorry However Worthless At Any Price!,"I hate to give a bad review. However I feel obligated to warn all. This mouse pad is only good for a prop. Only good to look at not to touch! Thirty days ago I purchased three of these thinking it would be a life time supply. Wrong. After one month use these three mouse pads are honest to goodness worn out! The material has in that short period of time separated from the overly light foam backing/base. This mouse pad didn't last. That's about one mouse pad per week! At the same time I purchased the equally boring but much better quality productBelkin F8E089-BLK 8-by-9-Inch Mouse Pad (Black). For the slight difference in price you'd be ill advised to purchase this inferior product. Sorry. This is a complete non pass durability wise. Again try the mouse pad mentioned above, you'll be glad you did way better quality and performance!"
3,blue mouse pad,"WOW! what do you say about a mouse pad? It's pretty on my desk. It stays put, doesn't get up and walk off!It lays there and does its job.Betty Boyle"
1,wrong,"The item they sent was wrong. I even called them and they reassured me it would fit my 1990 subaru legacy, but when i got it they were these big rubber rings that i have no idea what it would fit. I called again and they said that in the system it said it would fit my subaru and told me to return it, but it cost more to ship it so i kept them."
2,A good Saturday afternoon flick,"I saw this movies many years ago, and was reading a novel on a mid-east terrorist plot and automatically know where the guy lifted it from, so when I found out that I could get the movie I bought it!1 very happy customer"
3,YOU CAN'T HELP BUT LIKE THIS FILM...,"[w]ith dialogue as: ""You have 2 choices, duck or bleed!"" This isn't intended to be anything more than time wasting fare, yet there is a time accurate political element to the film proposing that the USSR was threatening to detonate a nuke in the Mid East oil fields in 1982. The film was released right around the time of Al Haig's exile from D.C. so there may have been more truth here than not. That aside, James Glickenhaus was the master of comic book violence in the early 1980's and you can see some of his influence in Quentin's first works. This is a good Saturday afternoon B flick the way the studios used to churn them out."
3,Not for outdoors,"The sign looks great, especially for the price. My problem with it is the fact that in about a year it has faded to about half the color intensity that it had when new.I give it ***** for indoor display, but only *** for outdoors."
1,Stay away unless you can test the product before 30 days passes. They will not refund bad product.,"Purchased this Q7551X 08/26/2012. When I put it into the printer this week it showed full, but prints extremely light, too light to read! It appears it was not properly filled when I purchased it and now - 4 months later when I go to open and use it, I have a defective product that the vendor will not replace. Will not purchase from this vendor in the future. My old cartridge is almost empty, but prints darker that this new one."
1,Doesn't work,"We opened it 42 days after we received it (being toner we order when we put the last one in) and it won't work. The pages print too light to be read. I contacted the seller who apologized for any ""inconvenience"" but will not accept the exchange or refund my one hundred sixty eight dollars since we are outside of the 30 day return window. This amounts to theft as far as I'm concerned. I am disgusted by this seller and amazon for their lack of customer service and highly disappointed in this experience. I would NOT recommend them. I wasted a lot of money."
1,Terrible! Terrible! Terrible! I would give it 0 stars if I could.,"I bought 2 pairs of these for use with a Ford and a Mazda. Both have narrow wipers of appropriate length and are supposed to be compatible with this product.The refills are just a tiny bit too wide (not more than 0.5mm or 1mm too wide) and that makes them 100% unusable. On the Ford, where I was lucky and I managed to squeeze the refills in it took FOREVER to get it right (I spent almost 30 minutes on the first wiper and about 15 on the second)On the Mazda, I just couldn't get it done. I had to use pliers to slightly widen the gap on the little metal pieces that are supposed to hold the refill just to get it through and ended up destroying my blades.I cannot think of a single good thing to say about this item!do yourself a favor and buy a different product."
4,Fresh perspective on WWII,"Uwe Timm, the author, accurately assesses this work as a novella. On the personal level, it is limited in scope: the only two characters whom the reader gets to know are the narrator and his interlocutor, a blind old woman in a Hamburg retirement home. We hear of other important characters (her wartime lover, her husband) only from her account of them. The background, however, is a richly detailed description of the home front in Germany in the closing days of World War II. Especially for anglophone readers it offers a fascinating, fresh perspective on ordinary Germans under National Socialism and in wartime. The ""hook""--a local dispute about the origin of kurrywurst, a popular type of German street food--may lack appeal for non-Germans, but its insights into women and men, young, old and middle-aged, are universal and endearing. The English translation is easy to read."
2,Unarmed Combatives 3,"Hello! This is Hock. This old video was part of a old training set. Without the other fundamentals, it is not worth much at all. Instead? I would search on my name, W. Hock Hochheim on the internet and see all the new, vastly improved material, in training order and on DVD! That is where I would spend my money. This whole subject has been reshot, redone and is so much better on DVD and much cheaper too! Given the new DVD, I wouldn't waste my time with this old video at all."
5,Great book!,"It is a really beautiful book, especially for someone who loves ballet. It will be loved by children and adults."
5,Evil Aliens rocks!,"Funny,excessively gross violence, play on aliens and crop circle fanatics.They must have gone through a vat of molasses for all the blood andgore. Kind of a Jerry Springer on crack alien movie. If you can livethrough the first 10 minutes of this one the rest is gravy. It's gota good spoof on the song 'Brand New Key' by Melanie, as they mow downevil aliens with a combine harvester...Fun Welsh anti Englishsentiment too. Great punch line in the end."
1,Don't believe the hype,"I rented this movie after reading the positive reviews from Amazon customers and I'm sorry to say they were wrong. Not only is it a travesty to compare this movie to the likes of Evil Dead 2 or Shaun of the Dead, but it's an absolute joke (and not a funny one at that) of an alien movie. This movie is, however, correctly compared to Feast, which is also a stupid movie. I don't know if it was an edited version that I watched (rated R) or these people just don't know what gore is, because this film is far from what I would call a ""gorefest."" Although, after trying to watch more than half of this incredible lame and stupid movie, I didn't even bother trying to watch the deleted or extended scenes. Unless you're a fan of movies like Snakes on a TRAIN or TransMORPHERS, I suggest looking elsewhere to be entertained. If nothing else, the fact that this movie wasn't released in America until 2 years after it was made should tell you something."
2,Steve's Review,"I'll take this one over Alligator X anytime! All I can say about this one is that it's not for the squeamish, the blood and gore is really over the top. The other thing about this movie is that it is one of those movies that is so bad it's good, I was laughing my butt off at several points and the ending was a good twist so I won't spoil it. This one is worth a rental if you get bored!"
4,Another Christmas winner from Andrew Parrott,"This was the first HIP Christmas cd I ever owned, and it remains a favorite more than a decade later. Most of the music here is not your typical seasonal fare, with Adestes fideles being the only recognizable ""carol"" in the bunch.Besides some fun early American Puritan hymns, there are two villancicos, a lovely Spanish one and a sprightly Mexican one. Praetorius is represented by a Magnificat based on a motet by Lassus, and there is a beautiful cantata by Charpentier telling of the shepherd's experience at the nativity. The Gloria by Pascha is very rustic and quaint, and admittedly not my favorite track.The highlight for me has always been John Foster's setting of While Shepherds Watched, a rousing Handelian sounding hymn of huge proportions. It is an absolute delight.Search this one out if you are tired of the same hackneyed Christmas classics and want something stirring and exciting."
2,Not Work the Purchase Price,"This video might be worth renting, but it is certainly not worth buying. This is not a criticism of Cher or her performance. As always, she is wonderful. It is a criticism of the video itself.First, the audio and video are mediocre. The video looks and sounds like an analog copy of a copy.Second, this really isn't a concert. It is made from excerpts of a few concerts, particularly the ""Cher: Farewell Tour"". In fact, I recommend just getting that video instead. It is a great concert film, available on Amazon for only a few bucks more, and free if you are a Prime member. It's also available on Netflix."
4,This product is a must-have for classic Macs,"If you have two or more classic Macintosh computers (those running on Mac OS 9 or before), this cable is a very simple networking cable that connects the older machines.Setting up networking on those older Macs is a cinch, and it makes me miss such simplicity on newer machines. Just use this cable to connect printer ports between the two machines, and launch AppleTalk.Moving files between the older machines is very slow this way (about the same speed you'd expect from an old floppy disk), but it works quite well."
1,A Piece of Junk,"This Tape Rewinder is noisy, slow and at first didn't work to rewind at all, just fast forward, but I was persistant and got the rewinder working. I was not happy with it at all."
4,the sorrowful song of the irish,The above reviews are difficult to expound on. The legacy of the irish traditions are made more understandable through the writing of this author. His descriptive narratives of the beautiful landscape contrast darkly with the daily lives that traverse it. I cannot wait for his next book.
3,I found the first CD Brainscapes better.,"Charakra just dosn't quite cut it. Its an OK CD, but really not too memorable. Also it tends to become boring after repeated playings... Brainscapes the first CD is much more trancy."
3,"Silly, hard to credit and in several cases aloppy","I am sorry to say that I was quite disappointed by this book. I had expected much more out of it and I also expected it to be more believable. It felt like I was reading the plot to a bad TV action movie, where the hero gets stabbed, shot, bluggened and can somehow outrun cars, safely jump out of airplanes and bring all of the bad guys to justice. Urgh. I don't mind pure escapism sometimes, but I was really hoping for a book with more substance. Especially after the build up of harriet's review and the very interesing plot device. Sigh. Good if you are looking for some action, bad if you were expecting to use your mind."
2,WAY OVERRATED BOOK ON BIOTECH,"to quote another user: ""The author's expertise in science, finance, management strategy, and journalism..."" the author can write decently and she may know about biotech (hard to judge for me not being a scientist)...BUT her knowledge about management strategy and finance is limited at best...that wouldn't be so bad if she were to stick to write about science...however, she thinks she knows about finance and strategy...who wants to read about strategy should stick with hamel, pralahad, porter etc., who wants to read about finance (valuation) should stick with copeland et al, and who wants to read about ipos should try articles by jay ritter."
1,CD Was Returned Within 24-hours,"I couldn't give this cd 1/4 of a star, so that's the reason for the 1 star. What a disappointment! After hearing the background songs from this past season, I thought this CD would be unmatched by previous seasons... whaaat a DISAPPOINTMENT... Can't wait for my Pride 2004 CD to arrive!"
1,Very not impress with QAF vol. 4...,"Never been so boring to be proud and queer! Nothing fabulous here. I would be surprise that anyone pick up this album from the home shelves to put on a CD player more than twice this summer. Will be forgotten from the music history in a flash!! For hard fan collector of the TV series only. I totally agree with the previous review. Do not waist your money. Save it and buy the British soundtrack instead even though it is very costly at least there is more joy and happiness on these albums ! Note that QAF vol.1 was nice, the 2nd OK, 3rd got really weird and 4th WOW on valium only...."
4,NEWS FLASH............,"Gay people like DIFFERENT KINDS OF MUSIC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! We're NOT all drugged-up bitchy circuit queens - some of us actually have open minds - and taste. It's nice to hear music that has a little effort put into it, & doesn't fuel gay stereotypes. There's some real talent on here, especially the Sanctuary track."
3,It will work,"The book came within the promised time. The book, however, was not the 'deluxe edition'. It was the older edition (older dust jacket), and the dust jacket had a small tear in one corner. There was some pencil underlining in it (which I am okay with), but I was really hoping for the newer edition, the one that was pictured."
5,Powerful Tool,This book is certainly good inspired and powerful in assisting the wife to uplift her husband.
5,Inspiring and Helpful,This book has helped me amazingly with my marriage. The prayers are very helpful especially if and when you don't know exactly what to pray for. I highly recommend this book the for all those who are married and going through some difficult time in there marriage.Live by His Words.
5,Teach me to pray,"Review by Lisa Ellis Williams, 2/09/12This review is of ""The Power of a Praying Wife,"" by Stormie O'MartianIf you read this book for the first prayer alone you have gotten your money's worth! The Power of a Praying Wife by Stormie O'Martian offers even more. When you don't want to pray for your husband, this book has you covered. When you don't know what to pray, it gives all you need to effectively take your concerns about him to God.I keep my copy near and have been using it to strengthen my prayers since 2000. I have am a living example of the power of a praying wife.The Power of a Praying Wife"
4,Great book!!,This book was recommended to me by a woman in my small group at church. It has AMAZING lengthy prayers in it that just about cover anything a wife would want for her husband. It also gives great advice on viewing your marriage from a spiritual standpoint. I would recommend this book to any wife!! It was very well written and powerful!
4,Power of the Praying Wife,This was recommended by a friend. It has given me some insight as to what I should be doing as a wife.
5,Best Self Help Ever,My womens bible study read this out loud in small groups. The best part is being able to reread the chapters you need. I copy the prayers and post them everywhere. The changes in you marriage starts with you and how much you want to change to please God not you husband. This was the best study book I ever did as a group. Now my husband and I are reading it together. Change happens in God's time and with His power and with your prayers. KEEP PRAYING.
5,This book has changed my life...,"This book has my changed life. I look at my husband with totally different eyes, Christ eyes and our marriage is better than ever. I have been praying for my husband for 5 to 6 years now. I bought this copy for my daughter-in-law."
5,great book,"This is a wonderful book for any woman to read... whether married or hoping to be married one day. It is extremely easy to read, without any complicated, wordy theological undertaking needed. It is divided up well, and you can find the time to read, digest, and pray each day... even after you are exhausted from taking care of the family all day."
3,Nice,Was sent on time but am not crazy about the paperback.. in addition the pages are brown and not thick..
2,Eh....,"Did you ever see one of those PTA cookbooks where each family has to contribute a recipe? Add some long-winded nutritional information and that's what this book is. There is very little to link the recipes to the nutritional information. The cover is very bland and there are no photographs. I bought this as a fan of womens gymnastics and because I was really interested in what USA Gymnastics says about nutrition in the face of all the criticism they've received about gymnasts with eating disorders and the like. The book offers little for the fan. Very few of the recipes quote the gymnasts directly, many are from the athlete's mother. The recipes are very standard, like what your home-ec teacher might reccomend. For the young gymnast in training this might be an interesting reference book, but no better any other book on youth nutrition. For the fan, you're better off spending your money on something else."
5,confused,"Although I have heard the album thanks to a radio promo, and love it...I am a bit confused as this album has NOT been released yet. It is set to release Feb 2006...This album is in my opinion, Plumb's best piece of work and is a must for any Plumb fan."
4,Some great gems,"There are some really great songs on this album. There are also a few songs that seem out of place and are just kind of annoying. Manic, Motion, and Pray for Me just dont fit on the album, and aren't very good, in my opinion. Blush and real Life Fairytale are both very sweet love songs. I cant do this, Better, and Good Behavior get the requisite ""like Evanescence"" label. Sleep is a favorite. The extended version of Damaged changed the song into one I actually like-the last two minutes are exceptional. Overall, its a really good album, though a bit mixed in style and tone. Plumb has a beautiful voice and can write well, though she tends to be repetitive in her songs."
5,Great tub,This tub was used to set a living tree in for the Christmas holiday. It was the perfect size to set a 20 gallon tree and pot into and still hve a bit of room. The steel tub caught any run-off from the melting ice that the tree was packed in to prrevent it from coming out of dormancy.
2,"I liked the recipies, but her historical facts are suspect.","If you know mythological, cultural and general history, you will not get confused by her disregard for verifiable historical facts. For beginners, I suggest Scott Cunningham's Solitary Practicioner (both books), the Farrar's Witches Bible Compleat, the Campanelli's Wheel of the Year, or Raymond Buckland's big blue witchcraft step-by step instructional (his wiccan history is fairly accurate too!). Also reading the Witches God/Goddess by the Farrar's is also a good suggestion for the cyclical nature of Wicca. Reading a book from the mythology or anthropology section of Amazon.com is preferable for an educational background. However, if you leave out the poor history, Ms.McCoy's ritual ideas and receipes are pretty good. I have her Maiden, Mother,Crone book and the meditations are excellent. Make wise and informed choices and always consider the source of the material you're reading (an old history student's mantra).Blessed Be, Denise"
4,Good Pad,It's really a good stuff to slide your mouse. It fits well with my computer desk. And it helped hit the free shipping...
5,"8"" Omelette Pan","This frying pan is by far a steal for the price. Very impressed with the quality, weight, how it cooks and cleans up. I wish all my frying pans were this nice! I use it as much as I can and wish I had two of them now! A definite deal you shouldn't pass up for under 10 dollars!"
1,Not as advertised,"This is not a good pan. We bought other Waterless Cookware on Amazon and love it, be also bought this as a small frying pan since our set only had one huge piece and we have been very disappointed with it. Food stick on this really bad and it does not clean easy at all, unlike our other cookware. Also the handle is not welded to the pan as the picture shows but uses two divers that go through the pan. The problem with that is that food and bacteria gets stuck in the divers and takes away from the health benefits of using surgical steel for cookware."
2,Nice to see Kenny Delmar as Sen. Claghorn,"I always liked the Sen. Claghorn character on the Fred Allen shows, and wondered what this filmwould be like. Nice to see it, but it's a weak story with very mild humor. That's the way alot of movies were, then, of course. I had hoped the humor would be sharper. It was on theFred Allen radio show, because Fred Allen wrote the jokes for his show."
1,A book of lies,"The author obbviously has something personal against the Prophet. Mr. Ali Dashti has penned some of the most ridiculuos untruths about Muhammad that were ever spoken. Any sensible reader, especially the non-Muslim, is better advised to check out an authentic biography on the Prophet from their local library."
3,Gluten free recipes,"It's nice to have a cook book out there with grain free recipes, especially for the gluten sensitive folks. I just didn't find lots and lots of recipes that looked interesting."
5,New beautiful voice!,Sophie Delila have a beautiful voice and it is a excelent performer with a high potential...
2,Mildly interesting...,"This disc turned out to be a Higher Octave Music sampler. It'sapprox. 43min length is kind of skimpy to make a claim of being amajor source for keyboard reference. The juicey liner notes makeyou think your listening to a gift for the senses; when in fact there is nothing that stands out here. The first track ""Body Language"" performed by Jonathan Cain is truly the only mememorable one. While there are 12 tracks listed but there are onlyactually nine, as three are more like preludes to the other selections ranging 32sec. to just over a minute and a half. Stillthe over all mood is mellow and ideal for late night listening or while reading. There surely is nothing that will break yourconcentration! Listen to the samples above, get it only for a cheap price!"
3,Bonus Tracks not HD,"I thought I noticed a drop in video quality when I viewed the 3 bonus tracks. After looking at the back cover, I see why. They are 480i SD. Also, the bonus tracks are stereo only. For such a short Blu-ray disc, they certainly could have made it all HD and 5.1. At least, there is not much of a premium in price for the Blu-ray over the DVD."
3,Very Short,"The filming and sound are great, but the the extras should have been included in the main show. Just seemed to be a very short DVD."
1,Cuidado con esta Biblia,"MacArthur niega que la sangre de Cristo nos limpia de nuestros pecados. Segun el, solo era la muerte de Cristo y no su sangre. Creo que eso sale en su comentario acerca de Hebreos 9:12, entre otros. Pero la Biblia dice acerca de la sangre de Cristo: ""En el cual tenemos redención por su sangre, remisión de pecados por las riquezas de su gracia."" (Efesios 1:7 RV1865)La historia que detalla acerca de la Biblia Reina-Valera no es muy precisa tampoco. Repita el error de que la RV1909 fue hecho para volver la Reina-Valera al Textus Receptus. Eso es falso, los mismos revisores decian que su Biblia era basada en el texto de Westcott y Hort. La 1865 fue basada enteramente en el TR, no como dice esta Biblia. Fue la Versión Moderna, hecho por H.B. Pratt años más tarde (1893) que usa como su base el texto de W. y H."
4,The Hound Will Follow the Scent of Blood,"This is an excellent listing of horror movies to rekindle memories or to suggest what to hire from your video store. Most horror films are here but not all. Critters is one of my favourites that is not in this book. There is a short summary of each film along with a rating and opinion. Obviously you are not going to agree with all the opinions and ratings. There are also summaries of different directors who have been influential in the horror genre. A listing of alternative titles at the back of the book helps you to quickly locate a film, as all films are in alphabetical order if you can not originally find it. There is also a list of all the actors who have been in horror films and information on what other horror movies they have been in. Photographs from various horror films are also included making this not a bad reference book."
4,Overview gives insights into the observers and the observed,"A scholar's work recommended for the advanced high school or university History student. A commentary on the people who have really formed our current perceptions of the Middle Ages not as they were fancied to be (ala Scott and Tennyson) but, as near as we know, as they really were. Includes biographical references as to who these scholars were, their personal lives and interests, habits and foibles. When you read their works, it will be more vibrant because you will have a knowledge as to WHO these people are... not just generic observers, but unique observers with unique perspectives. The book also condenses these scholar's basic theories of their particular disciplines, so you get a detailed overview of the Middle Ages at the same time. ..................."
5,Windshield Knife,Great tool- gives super leverage when working with urethane glass adhesives.Take your time and it will work out fineA++++
5,Superior Kite,This kite is a superior product and worth the price because children and adults enjoy flying it. It is very well made and works well even with just a light breeze.
3,The branding book is better...,I purchased the 22 immutable laws of branding first and rate it five stars. This book seems to be 90% the same as the branding book and does not really offer any additional insight.I recommend purchasing the branding book first...
5,Timeless laws,"Although this book is rather old, and was written before the online era, these marketing laws are timeless and should be etched in to the mind of every marketer. Highly recommended, even in 2007."
2,Don't Waste Your Time,"This book is highly overrated. While there are a handful of good marketing ideas in the book, they are certainly not ""laws"". In my opinion, this book isn't even remotely worth the time it costs to read."
5,Good experience!!!,"Timely and in good shape, packaged very well. I will use again for next class.Good price as well, affordable. Good experience."
4,Great and Easy Book To Read!!!!,I thought that this book was very easy to read and understand. The authors tells you very well about all the laws of marketing which I thought could be a very good guideline for people in the marketing field. It is a very short book so it won't take you too long to finish it!!! Highly recommended for reading!!!
3,true grit : marketing conceptuals w/ tooth,This is my very first marketing book. I am a graphic designer & from an artistic &/or plain old 'reading' perspective I would have never picked up such a book - but it was recommended to me by the management. Upon reading 'The 22 Immutable Laws of Marketing' I did find my mind spinning about - thinking of the concepts - opening up inside. I found the book to be a bit smutty & 'right there'. Many of the chapters seemed to loop around & repeat each other conceptually [ a bit distracting ]. Sometimes the whole 'grammar' thing seemed to take second tier to the overall content of the book [ not entirely bad if they are targeting those people reading for surface info - for the lowbrow & obvious | but i am looking for something a bit deeper if anyone can recommend something a bit richer for the next marketing read ].
1,The 22 Immutable Laws of Markeying,"This book is horrrible. It is at least 20 years out of date. There are glaring errors in data and assumptions. I found my self on several occasions being embarrassed for the two fine authors who have written many good books. This is not one of them, don't waste your money."
4,A QUICK READ AND A GOOD REFERENCE,"The perfect companion volume to The 22 Immutable Laws of Branding. However, I found the laws of marketing to overlap somewhat with the laws of branding. But, hey, who ever said the marketing and branding are mutually exclusive sciences? Or sciences at all, for that matter?The 22 Immutable Laws of Marketing is an excellent refresher course to overall marketing principles in the form of bite-size sections. A quick read and a good reference."
5,Great,"This book was simply great... fun to read, with lots of meaningful contents, great ideas and examples. I'm very happy after reading it."
3,Better for 5 and up,"This book does have a lot of good craft ideas. I bought it because I work with preschoolers and wanted projects for my 3 year olds. These are mostly crafts that need to be done with older kids that can manage a stapler, scissors, follow muliple step directions. Lots of teacher prep if you work with the younger kids."
5,"Downton Abbey, Season 2","I'm hooked on the Abbey! What a fun group of characters to watch and such an interesting historical period. I think Maggie Smith is just a hoot as the Dowager Countess and gets the funniest lines. It is great to have this available for watching on my Kindle - I started watching late in Season 2, so being able to get Season 1 and 2 as a Prime member is really nice to have to get all caught up on the story lines."
5,Awesome..addicting,I LOVE this series... Great show with spectacular characters and acting. I hope they keep making more seasons... I can't wait to see what happens in season 3.
5,put that in your pipe and smoke it!,"when i saw episode one, i immediately prceeded to purchase the whole of season 1&2! its so well done, all the actors were superb, and i love maggie smith as the stoic matriarch, she plays that so well! i watched the whole of season 1 in one sitting,which takes a while but there was no dull moment for me, just enough comedy/drama/romance to make it a good watch for me.lots of the time i wanted to ring lady marys neck though ahaha, definetly a good show for those who like BBC tv series, i can tell you what, ill definetly be buying the rest of the seasons :)"
5,"We really enjoyed the series, looking forward to season 3","Many friends told us how good this show was, finally we decided to watch it and have really enjoyed it"
5,This show is great!,"I just started watching Downton this season, so being able to watch the previous season was great! I like how it saves your place when you have to quit watching for awhile."
5,I'm Addicted!!,Very good class warfare piece. I love them!! Why does this require a certain number of words. Brevity is the soul of wit!
5,"Upstairs, Downstairs...","A show about people who live a different way from now. I wouldn't mind living either upstairs or downstairs, in service or being served, if it meant living with these fine people."
5,"Love the series, but the streaming was choppy!","Fantastic series, but I think the world is already aware of that! I did have some problems with the Prime streaming of it, though. It was working much better when we watched the first season on Netflix. If Amazon is going to have the sole rights for it, it needs to have the technical chops to handle streaming shows without interruption. I'm really hoping it was just a rough night for them."
4,Almost a 5 Star,"Add 5.1 audio instead of 2.0 and you have 5 stars. Otherwise the video quality was top notch, not 1080P but dvd quality. For those of you who do not have a home theater system that can use the 5.1 audio then it's 5 stars."
5,Great series,Glad I've got the whole season to catch up with Downton Abby The series is worth watching very interesting and is very entertaining
1,Wrong region!,"When I loaded the DVD the message wa ""this disc will not play in your region"". I have had many DVD's before, including season one of Downton, and have never had that happen. What a waste! -Bob"
3,"Very happy with this product, BUT...","I purchased this DVD of Downton Abbey Season 2 (Original U.K. Unedited Edition) only one month ago, in mid February. I love love love the show and the dvd works great, but I just came across it again for sale on Amazon and noticed that it now comes with the option to buy the dvd and watch it instantly, which was not available when I first bought it. The instant download came with my first season so it would have been nice to have the same option for my second season. I hate when I find a great product only to be discover it's upgraded version the next month..."
1,Save your money.,"As incredible and surprising as Season One turned out to be, Season Two was just as incredible and surprising - only in the other direction. We gave up on it after Episode 3. We have a biblical theme with men coming back from the dead, unrequited love on steroids, and interwoven plot themes that border on the bizarre. The writers must have been on strike. Thoroughly disappointing."
5,Best show,This one of the best shows on TV. It gives you a good mix of drama and history. The acting is excellent!
5,More Marvelous TV,"Just when you think ""Downton Abbey"" can't get any better, season 2 brings the viewer closer into the family circle of England's Lord and Lady Crawley as well as their vast staff of servants. Season 2 opens with WWI reaching in to the Abbey and taking away many of it's men and finishes just a dramatically as one would expect of a Masterpiece Theatre offering. As I have said before, ""Downton Abbey"" is just plain good TV, it's a shame that the rest of the networks can not follow suit."
5,downton abby review,"I enjoy the pace of the storyline, fashion, scenery,etc. There appears to be interface between servants and titled with heart felt genuinely felt fondness."
1,Frequently stops,This series has the annoying habit of stuttering and stopping. It can take a half our or so to get it back running properly. It's very frustrating when this happens over and over again. 1 hour show easily becomes an all evening affair.
4,donton Abbey,"I wish there were subtitles The volume on my computer isn't always clear. Love the series, acting and beautiful scenery"
5,A Surprisingly Engaging Show,"I'm very picky about what I watch. Usually after two episodes, I turn to something else. When I read the description of Downton Abbey, it didn't sound like anything I'd care about. The reviews were so good though, I gave it a try. So glad I did! I watched the first two seasons on Prime, and then watched them again. The acting is fantastic, the characters engaging. You really learn to either love them or hate them. I can hardly wait to watch season 3."
5,Great Show,"Great show, interesting characters, interesting story line. It has me waiting for the next showas soon as the one I'm watching is over. Waiting for season 3 to be released.Really enjoy Prime video streaming"
5,Great show,"This is a great show! It is so intriguing and full of drama. The quality of the video is also really, really good. It streamed very quickly and fluidly without any problems."
5,This really needs 10 stars!,"For a year I had been hearing from friends about Downton Abbey and didn't have a clue of what they were talking about it until one of them gave me the DVD of the 1st Season. I was hooked within the first 5 minutes and proceeded to watch an episode every night and immediately ordered Season 2 so I wouldn't miss a night with the Downton Abbey family. Most engaging story, most engaging characters and actors and am counting the days till Season 3 starts."
3,The suds are thick this season!,"I loved season 1, but season 2 had so much soap opera melodrama, it was almost laughable . From the officer impregnating the house maid to Matthew' s ""Miraculous"" cure so he was no longer crippled, to Lavinia' s ""convenient death from the Spanish flu, I thought I was watching a Mexican reflexively . excessively cornet!"
4,Very addictive,"Downton Abbey has a very good story, good casting, good photography and an amazing scenery and some few cliches that don't spoil the serie"
5,"Marvelous, superbly-acted period drama","Really, it's all in the title. Although I'm not usually one for period dramas, the phenomenal cast makes this show a must-see. Maggie Smith as the Dowager-Countess is of course just spot-on, but so are so many of the other actors and actresses from top to bottom. The sets and exteriors are gorgeous, the directing is excellent... The seasons are short but well-planned, which makes this a great show if you don't want to spend hour after hour catching up. Honestly, I can't think of a single thing to criticize. I can't wait for the 3rd Season!"
1,Want my order cancelled,"I need to cancel this order and I see no way to do it. I will not put money on my account until this is cleared out, as I live in Canada and it will not download anyway.Season one was great...as my wife was in Atlanta when she downloaded that."
1,Amazon doesn't have CC,Actually I enjoyed it but had to watch it on my PC from the PBS website as Amazon did not provide CC. It seems Amazon is late and slow getting CC coverage on their shows.
3,Amazon Epsiode #'s different,"Be aware when ordering single episodes, that Amazon numbers the 2-hour season opener as 2 separate episodes, making the episode numbers different from PBS. I accidentally ordered an episode I had already seen and is available on PBS for free."
5,Wonderful...,"This is a very interesting tale. Well written, well acted, and well presented to the public. I'll be honest: I missed most of seasons one and two and purchased them both from Amazon to catch up in my viewing while season three was already airing. Thoroughly enjoy the story lines coming from ""downstairs,"" as well."
5,Downton Abbey,"This was a wonderful season. There were a lot of twists and turns to the plot-line, and it was great finally to get through the war years. I look forward to season 3."
4,Addictive you will be itching to see season 3!,I grew up without cable and with PBS and I love to see people really get into masterpiece theater! Maggie Smith is perfection and the story is addictive! I saw both seasons in one day and I cannot wait to see season three!
4,"If you liked Upstairs, Downstairs...","then you should love this series too. Well acted, it's an engaging British drama series set in the early 1900s. High production values and interesting characters, even if it is pretty much a soap opera. And who doesn't love the irascible Maggie Smith?"
1,Doesn't Work.,"I've tried updating adobe flash, but this film will not play for me. There is limited help on the site to fix the problem. I've attempted this with both Firefox and IE. It starts to play but crashes soon after the PBS logo appears."
5,Downton Abbey season 2,Really fantastic series. Filled with wonderful British wit and sharp tongued banter. Looking forward to watching more episodes. Highly recommended if you love English drama.
5,Some of the best TV available,"Wouldn't miss Downton Abbey. I don't watch much TV but I love this show....it has something for everybody, drama and humor., can be predictable but is well written and great actors involved."
5,Downton Abbey Season 2,Downton Abbey Season 2 was packaged nice and it arrived a day ahead of it's scheduled due date. Very happy with purchase
5,Love it,"I love this show. I dislike how Netflix only has the first season, but at least I found the other 2 seasons on here."
5,I love this show!,"I feel transported into another world when I watch this show. It is well written, interesting and a classic drama."
5,Wonderful!,Just as good as the first season. PBS has such a winner here. We get a good understanding of what life was for the elite. We all have our ups and downs and we are there for the ride.
5,Downton Abbey,"Like everyone else, I am involved with the lives of those at Downton Abbey!! I have enjoyed the first two seasons and like being able to re-run them. My friend also borrows them and goes through the whole series before returning them. She actually has watched them more than I have!!!! Series three will soon be landing on my doorstep!!"
4,Downton Abbey 1 season,"Great literay video,lines,story and cinema presentation was exellent. The acting was great and the capture of the period mentallity was enlightening. The picture quality was execellent."
5,Christmas Episode,"This DVD DOES include the Christmas Episode which is the season 2 FINALE. Hope this is helpful...Amazon does not make it clear. Excellent Series, very happy with this DVD. Also includes extras on Disc 3."
3,"Great Product, Now Free","We bought this right before it became a freebie on Amazon Prime. What a waste of money, but an excellent show!"
5,Excellent quality,Downton Abbey is a great show and the quality of this copy is excellent high definition. I have been watching it using the Amazon app for Xbox and it works wonderfully.
5,Very well done period piece,"This is a turn of the century period piece in which we follow the lives of the wealthy English property owners and the servants that run their manor. Production value, notably the costumes, and acting are not to be missed. Every episode gets better and better!"
5,Downton Abbey Original UK Version Season 2,We thoroughly enjoyed Season 2 of Downton Abbey. The story line for upstairs and downstairs are enjoyable. I was disappointed that Lady Sybill left the series.
5,Best series ever,"I dont normally watch a lot of television, but this is a must. The series shows us what greatness television is possible. I love the castle and the clothes"
5,Downton Abbey,The series was very entertaining. I can't wait for season 3. The storyline is excellent and is very worthy of the title and place in Masterpiece Classics.
4,wanted more.,"This is a series I really enjoy because of the cast and the setting. It really addresses the issues of class/caste, the inequality at the time and how people viewed the levels of separation. It uses this story line to expose the system. The human condition that fought to have the opportunity to be whom and what they aspired to. The start of the women's movement and the blurring of classism. It shows that you can be whatever in spite of the position you hold in society by way of birth. The price of holding the estates was more than just the cost."
4,The Blue Ray disc fails in the second time it was played,"Thugh I love the serie, and don't worry about anything in the subjet, I complain about the fact that the second time I played it( I'm not a native English speaker), the image begun to broke untill was lost forever.It's not my blue ray player fault, beacause it plays other discs properly."
5,Great to have my own Copy,"The week that PBS ended Downton Abbey Season 2, my DVD copy with extra scenes arrived in excellent condition. No problem with this vendor."
3,Great Program. Lousy Video,"I paid extra for HD reception. None of the episodes filled my TV screen, as all other HD programs I receive will. The HD was mediocre, and episodes 2 and 8 were not even Amazon-HD quality. Very disappointing for a company that has always before delivered what it promised."
3,ok quality,while watching sometimes the download freezes and you need to restart episode. very frustrating. otherwise when playing without any freezing good quality.
5,Watch it!,It was recommened by a couple friends and I am so glad they did. Can't wait for Sunday night to see more.
3,no English subtitles,"The program is fantastic and that's why I was very happy to be able to buy Season 2 on Amazon. I saw Season 1 on Netflix but they don't carry Season 2. I was very disappointed to discover that there are no subtitles in English in the Amazon version. The sound quality is okay but the variety of English accents make it hard to understand some really subtle details which are often said quickly. With the Netflix, the subtitles can be turned on so it makes viewing a lot easier."
5,Downton Abbey,"Loved this. Was addicting to watch, though the time can speed along. Characters were real, and relatable. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who enjoys the time period."
5,Great for lower handicap golfers,"For years I have had the physical skill to shoot low rounds, but still was not capitalizing on course layout and shot progression/planning. This book does exactly what the subtitle says: Scoring your best when you're not playing your best. This book focuses on countless mental aspects of golf and provides several examples of how to think about certain conditions and shot types on the golf course. It is a short book packed with valuable information. It is written in a very friendly teaching manner and is never condescending. This book points out so many subtleties on the golf course and how to adjust accordingly. It does not focus much on swing mechanics and ball-striking.I've read a few other instructional golf books, but this one seemed to clear up the issues I was having and taught me SUCCESSFULLY how to lower my score. If you are a 15 handicap or lower, I would recommend this book for you. Get it and lower your score too!"
3,"Good build up, disappointing result","I'm new to the Rebus books, and am just working my way through from the start.To me, this was a stranger novel than Hide & Seek, with Rankin really starting to grom the character of Rebus.I felt the displacement to London worked well, and while the Wolfman mystery was intriguing it was wrapped up a little ridiculously.Worth a read, and I'm moving on to book 4 in the series soon, so it has left me wanting more."
5,Excellent Experience,"This book arrived within a couple of days. Even though it was second hand, it was in good shape, no markings, no dog-eared or torn pages. I would recommend the vendor to anyone and will be happy to use them again in the future."
3,ECW Cyberslam 1999 review,"The Yoshihiro Tajiri-Jerry Lynn match was a solid bout but nothing amazing. The Super Crazy-El Mosco match was again nothing amazing but a pretty sweet match. The Taka Michinoku-Papi Chulo match was real nice but not better then the opener. The TV title match between Rob Van Dam & 2 Cold Scorpio was not great but pretty good. The World title match between Taz & Chris Candido was a great bout even with the dumb ending. The Justin Credible-Shane Douglas match while not bad but it could have done better. The Ultimate Jeopardy match between the team of Mustafa Saed & The Dudley Boyz(Buh Buh Ray Dudley & D-Von) against the team of New Jack & The Hardcore Chair-Swinging Freaks(Balls Mahoney & Axl Rotten) was a hardcore,smash-mouth,bloody brawl and a good reminder of the NWA Wargames in the 1980's. I give this PPV a 6 out of 10."
5,HAS been **DIGITALLY REMASTERED!**,"THE COMPLETE ECW LIBRARY has been **DIGITALLY REMASTERED!**This is Pure ECW,none of that WWE crap... of course BloodSport is a great release...If you are a TRUE fan you will buy this.Intense Action and great matche's...PERIOD..."
3,Kinda Good,"I liked it the first time I heard it in A&F, but after I bought the CD I realized it's slower and more mellow than I like. Wish someone would do a faster remix of it---then it would be really cool."
4,worked great,"This worked great in my 2005 Ion. The color labeling was a bit odd tho. Like there are three red wires and the package says that there are two red and one orange. The power of deduction will soon get the job done, but it is a bit confusing for a little while."
4,The best comedy show ever made!,"This 2-disc DVD contains some of the best moments in Monty Python (Spam, How Not To Be Seen, Atilla the Hun Show, Hungarian Phrase Book) as well as some that are lesser known (Communist Quiz, Poofy Judges, Crackprot Religions, The Idiot). The menus are very clever. They are a little tough to navigate through, but it's a change from other DVD menus. The extras are enormous! You get Lumberjack Kareoke, BBC sketches, quizes with video rewards, two Hollywood Bowl sketches, image gallery and tons more. However the only part that seems to suffer on this disc is the picture quality. There are tons of noticable fragements and rainbows. The VHS tapes might be a smarter buy in terms of quality, but for everlastingness (is that even a word?) choose the DVDs. So grab this DVD and order in some Egg and Spam, Egg Bacon and Spam, Egg Bacon Sausage and Spam, Spam Eggs Spam Spam and Spam, Spam Spam Spam Spam Spam Spam Spam Spam Baked Beans Spam Spam Spam and Spam."
5,A little treasure chest,"A marvellous, book this ranges from the Aleph-Bet to the Infinite.From Democritus's atomic theory to Godel's Theorem.If you like Borges, you will enjoy Quine."
5,this book rocks da house!!!!!!!!!!!,"this book is perfect for finding the right card you need for a deck, online questions, and for help when you brag about haveing a good card in a chat room (Art's and entertainment: magic the gathering)so you have al the answers about the card if they ask in disbelief . ~ EQD EQD EQD!!!"
4,Freestyle:Made Easy Better,I really am impressed with the Total Immersion series. It's very good for self teaching and also improves swimming where it is enjoyable instead of a struggle. You'll save yourself a lot of time and effort using this video. This particular video doesn't have music in the background and it makes the lessons less appealing. I enjoyed seeing different people swimming and the music in the Freestle:Made Easy better.
1,Not What I thought It was,When I purchased this dvd I expected to receive the older cartoon version of the chipmunks singing Christmas songs. Instead I got the 2008 computer animated version. What a disappointment.
2,"Superficial, bad job.","This documentary purports to examine the various methods by which man has attempted to alter his everyday consciousness and achieve some sort of transcendent spiritual experience. There are many ways to do this, and the video mentioned a few, such as trance dancing, self-infliction of pain, and the ingestion of alcohol and psychotropic drugs. Some other methods that should have been mentioned include glossolalia, traditional meditative prayer, chant, isolation, fasting, etc. However, the only method this documentary actually talked about was drug use. I admit it was pretty interesting to see Peruvian Indians ingesting mescaline through their nostrils, but the video should have been entitled ""Religious experience and drugs"" or something to that effect. The title led me to expect something a bit more comprehensive, but all it offers is 50 minutes of superficial discussion on drugs. Skip it and read Henry James instead."
4,good stuff,"It's not bad. If you like Goth Rock, you'll probably like it. A little more instrumentation and classical themes than, say, Within Temptation or Luccana Coil. And the female vocalist -- while good -- isn't of the same quality as those two. But, very good. A good listen."
2,Great for 2 months...,"then it died. It is still detected when plugged into the computer, but the player will no longer boot. I"
2,Worked great.. for a while.,"Bought one of these for my 14 year old son, who used it almost constantly. Thought it was so cute I bought one for myself as well. After about 2 weeks he complained that the play/pause button (also the on/off button) was difficult to push. A few days later he couldn't get it to work at all. Given that I paid almost nothing for it, I wasn't about to mess with sending it to Coby, so I opened it up to see what was going on. Problem was basically a poor design. The little push buttons stand up at right angles to the PC board inside, and when you press on them it strains the tiny little solder joints that hold them down, eventually breaking them. The play/pause button is especially weak since it's on the end. I swapped units with him and told him to be real careful with the buttons. He was, and was able to get another 6 months out of the thing before the second one died the same way. I guess there's a good reason that Coby's products are ""budget priced"".."
2,Coby: It's a crap shoot.,"I got this thing a long time ago. It was pretty nifty at first. It worked as a 1gb flash drive that would play any MP3 it found on it, and that's about it. The battery life on one AAA was about 8 hours, so you might want to invest in rechargeables. It sounded decent, was compact, light, and portable. Then after a few months the screen started showing garbage. I could still get it to play MP3's but I could not directly choose the one I wanted. It would lock up, and I'd have to take out the battery to reset it. It was malfunctioning badly. After contacting Coby, they basically told me to change the batteries and don't try to play DRM music. I would never dare allow DRM onto any of my systems, and I've got plenty of fresh batteries for every occasion, so I felt that their response was more or less a brush off.Out of the box, Coby electronics are generally neat devices, but they all reliably fail, so don't get too attached to any of them."
4,Just what I needed,"I just wanted something small and able to hold just enough music for gym time. I use the FM radio option a lot also. However within the first week I received this item, it developed a little invisible line through the words on the screen. Maybe I dropped it or it got bumped in my backpack."
2,stinks,for some odd reason about once every two weeks or so the mp3 player goes on the fritz and has to be reformatted. when you reformat it all the music you had on there before gets deleted and you get to download it all over again. joy! and sometimes after you reformat the device the titles and artists appear in chinese instead of english. it's like a free lesson in a foreign language!!! i wasn't expecting much because it was like 20 bucks but i still have to say that it stinks pretty bad.
2,"Good pics, questionable text.","This book would a much higher rating with me if I could be confident that the contents are accurate.Example: There is an unlikely, if not impossible, illustration of a Kenworth logger which cannot be the model it is listed as.Good coffee table fodder for the casual observer."
3,NOT THE BEST,"ALTHOUGH IT IS A GOOD BOOK, IT SHOULD BE NAMED DIFERENTLY. IS MORE ABOUT HOW TO BE FIT AND HOW TO TRAIN YOUR BODY FOR MOTOCROSS"
2,Unarmed Combatives 4,"Hello! This is Hock. This old video was part of a old training set. Without the other fundamentals, it is not worth much at all. Instead? I would search on my name, W. Hock Hochheim on the internet and see all the new, vastly improved material, in training order and on DVD! That is where I would spend my money. This whole subject has been reshot, redone and is so much better on DVD and much cheaper too! Given the new DVD, I wouldn't waste my time with this old video at all."
5,Wonderful new chapters in Hitty history,"A well written and entertaining look at times in our American history through the eyes of our beloved Hitty (a little wooden doll). These new chapters in Hitty history are a great way to teach children history while entertaining them too. I recommend this to adults and children alike. Not to replace Newberry Award winning Hitty, her first hundred years, by Rachel Field. But great additional reading for the Hitty, doll or history lover."
1,RCA Modems have faulty power connectors,Used to work in cable tech support. The only modem with repetitive modem failure problems were RCAs. There is a design flaw with the connection to the power cord that causes modems to short out or become so sensitive they will reset if they are just touched. Any other Docsis compatible modem will work out better.Maybe after this review RCA will look into this and fix it.
1,Lost connection very easily,"I signed up for internet cable and decided to rent the cable modem at first. The cable company delivered this RCA model; so I technically didn't buy, I rented it. Highly unreliable. Seemed to have a loose connection. If you accidentally tapped the modem with your foot, you could lose the connection. Once the kids started jumping in the room, and this cable modem lost the connnection. Come on. On the other hand, when it worked, it was fine."
2,Same Problem,I've had the same thing with this modem since day 1 seems to be the power connector if you move the modem or touch the power wire it disconnects or sometimes does it by itself. I tried to make the contacts tighter by compressing the connectors in the socket in but it still does it. I'm gonna go see if ATTbi can give me a replacment.
2,discolored quickly,"Nice feel and design, but flatware rusted and discolored within weeks of use. Cambridge has the poorest website I have seen in years, and when I finally did reach customer service they were not helpful.Cambridge claims discoloration comes from lemon soap or dishwasher use.The problem is that we use neither of these, so clearly they make a poor product."
3,Nice story,Nice story and fairly accurate Bibically. It just didn't hold my attention as well as I had hoped. It was an interesting and very enjoyable portrayal of Elijah.
2,Not a very good book,"Not that I expect much from books like this but come on, even I (a 15 year old boy) could write a better book than this. Here's an idea: Kids get lottery ticket, find out it's a winner and chase it all over town loooking for it. So original. Not a very good way to spend 30 minutes...plus you can predict the entire book just by reading the titles of the Chapters in the Table of Contents. Skip this one."
1,"Love the product, but shipping does not contain product","I have purchased a case of Snuggle 2xs and have been disappointed on its arrival. Each time, more than one bottle had lost its entire contents in the shipping process. I found a lovely scent and wet soggy box of fabric softener on my doorstop. It's wonderful to have the smell permeating the laundry room, however, each bottle is wet and/or greasy and slippery when the softener spilled from other bottles dries on it. I would love to purchase more, but will not until the shipping issue can be resolved."
3,comment requested by amazon,"Wallet was too thick even with two credit cards, license and money. I think the canvas was too thick although durable and does not slip from the back pocket.I was looking for a thin wallet with plastic inserts that are durable (I hope that you have developed a better plastic by this time that does not stick to the plastic cards."
1,Who Wrote The Songs?,Hey buttheads who was the main people behind CCR and wrote most of the the songs? The Fogertys
1,Not funny and filled with errors,"This book is supposed to be funny? It's not and it is filled with errors and typos. Many of the recipes just don't work and ""Chef Ted"" has admitted this. The whole concept of the book is insulting.Don't waste your money."
1,Good way to end a date with no action,"Seeing this book on any bachelor's shelf is a guarantee he won't be getin' any from me. The recipes are lame and not transcribed correctly. This book is in serious need of a professional editor. I'm sure the title is *supposed* to be funny (I'll bet it's a big hit at the frat house) but any adult male who seriously wants to get laid, would be better off consulting Betty Crocker than this amatuerish rubbish."
4,best cookbook I own!,"I picked this book up at tower on campus the other day, and it has fast become the best, most used cookbook I own!Everything I have attemped came out perfect and I have suddenly become one of the most popular guys on campus.If you need an extra edge on the dating front, and who doesnt?, then I recommend this book!"
5,HA Is The Greatest,"As an official CC member, Rondo Brother, and honorary BandMember, I can tell you al that this is a great record."
2,Bitterly Disapointing,"Those expecting the sweet funky pop mix from ""Decadence"" will be horribly disappointed in this album, as much as I love Daryl, the songs are not nearly as catchy."
3,Brian is to IME what Gary was to VH,"I was a big fan of Extreme with Gary Cherone (except for their last album; there was no punchline). And, in the same way, Brian is not a bad singer. But he just doesn't fit with IME, IMHO. I spun this disc at least 20 times and came away each time liking it less and less, which is the opposite of my experience with S&F. I'm listening to One More Astronaut right now and thinking, ok, if IME can't get Edwin back then guys please go back to your list of candidates and try again. Brian will be okay.. in a different band."
3,"Good design and feeling, but","I liked its design and feeling.But it worn out so fast.I only used less than 24 times, but it has already three holes.I had to order different item."
2,The con man,Never really could generate any interest in this book. Was tempted a few times to delete it from my kindle before i even finished the book. I hung in there but still not generate any interest. My first read of this author and my last.
3,The Con Man,I enjoyed the book and will consider reading more books by Ed McBain. I really liked the price I paid for the book.
5,One of the best ghost DVD collections....,This collection is truly great and one of my favs. I am really happy that they have spent the time to gather all the episodes and took the time to share these stories on a great DVD collection. If you believe or not you have to agree that the stories are truly interesting. Worth the time and the money.
3,Not for a regular sized shower,"I bought this item to use in the shower for bathing my dogs. Unfortunately, I have a normal sized shower. I believe this item would do fine in an oversize shower, but fails miserably in a regular sized shower. The legs take up too much room and are a trip hazard."
5,Roaster,I love it. The quality is great and it heats well and even. Its nicer than a far more expensive pot I saw at a quality store was.
5,Great Product,It is made of heavy gauge stain less steal. The lid doubles as another shallow roasting pan. Cleans up easily.
5,Changed formula ):,"I received my order yesterday of Saxon Golden Musk that I ordered through CVS.com. They obviously changed the formula to this cream, the scent is totally different! I called Lee Pharmaceuticals and they confirmed that the formula was changed!"
3,Good show. Not so good video,I just finished watching all 3 discs in this set and I have to say that I was slightly disappointed. I had to adjust my TV to watch disc 1 (it was a bit too bright). I was also bothered that they changed the music during the zombie scene in The Phantom Menace and Mr. Kraft's montage in Super Hero. Even so it is still Sabrina and if I can overlook the Josh character I can overlook these minor problems.
2,lousy editing of a wonderfull story,"I love these books. During a recent move, I lost my copy of Wizard's Bane, the first book in this wonderfull series. I was very sad when I found out it was out of print. Then I saw this book on Amazon. The first 2 books in the series, reprinted together! I bought it, read it, and almost burned it. The editing is so horible, it almost ruins the story. Paragraphs run together, or are split for no apparent reason. Quotation marks and other punctuation are missing, extra, or in the wrong place. In some places text is repeted. The editor who let this piece of unmitigated junk go to print aught to be exiled to Siberia. This story is a must read, but only buy this book if there is no way you can get your hands on a copy of the original printing."
2,Traditional Turks: BAAAD! ; Modern Turks: GOOOD!,"Repeat after me:Traditional Turkey: BAAAAD!Modern Turkey: GOOOOD!I would love to have seen this same film from the perspective of the villagers, who were portrayed here as villanous mobsters:a cross between rural mafia and fundamentalist women haters. I have met many villagers in my short stay in Turkey and never met monsters like these.So, sorry, I don't buy this urban portrayal of hateful villagers.Beautiful cinematography though."
5,Fantastic drama,"""Bliss"" (""Mutluluk"", in Turkish) is the story of a young woman from rural Turkey who is discovered, unconscious and partially disrobed, on the edge of a lake near her village. The movie follows the events subsequent to this discovery. The village is scandalized by the perceived sexual misconduct on the part of this woman and her punishment determines the course of the plot.Acting was superb, with performances, in turn, heart-wrenching, funny and insightful. Cinematography was very good, showing off the Turkish countryside and the city of Istanbul well.The DVD delivers audio in Dolby Pro Logic, and the extras are meager.Note: This DVD employs the original Turkish language audio track, and provides English subtitles. We found the subtitles a bit small, making it challenging to read them on our old, admittedly past-its-prime CRT TV, but completely legible on our plasma set."
3,"Great material, odd cuts, disorganized presentation","I just finished using this text in a graduate course on ancient skepticism. I have to say I was not particularly enamored of the organization of the material. I found the breakdown into subject matter less helpful than a breakdown by source would have been.That said, the translations are good, read well, and communicate meanings effectively. The sweep of the material is impressive. Some of the cuts and emendations are rather odd, though, particularly in the Sextian Modes. In comparison to Annas and Barnes' translation (""Outlines of Scepticism""), which preserves the complete text, ""HP"" was lacking.This book does not offer much in the way of analysis or historical context, either. If you're studying Sextus, go with either of Annas' books (her other is ""Modes of Scepticism"") as an intro text. If you want a truncated reader in the area, this book will do."
3,Review of Hackett's 'Hellenistic Philosophy',"I rarely review a work I didn't finish reading, but I couldn't justify following this one to the end. As another viewer mentioned, the organization of this work is very unhelpful. At times, passages seemed to be ordered according to theme, and at other times according to doxographical author. This makes it incredibly difficult for the reader to see lasting themes in each school's thought.I'm now turning to A. A. Long, as well as Hackett's 'Stoics Reader' (also by Inwood of 'Hellenistic Philosophy'), both of which seem to have a clearer organization."
5,A MUST READ!!,"This book was just what I needed to get through my divorce. It is a must read for everyone experiencing the pain and craziness of divorce. You will see that you are NOT alone and your feelings are not crazy even though the rest of the ""never divorced"" world believes they are! I keep the book close to review parts of it on those ""bad"" days!"
5,Good perspecitve,"Crazy Time is a good review of what could and will happen during a divorce. It goes through some very good phases that one slips back and forth into and out of, and helps one feel normal (though indeed crazy) about. Except for just a few small areas, it is equally written for both men and women. Extremely helpful for understanding oneself now and helping to plan for the future."
3,Useful when divorcing,"This is not the ""bible"" - as someone told me it would be - for those getting divorced, but it is useful. It's more a smattering and a general commentary than it is a guide. What should I do? - the book sometimes answers that but not always. Does provide good insights."
2,Slow and poor,"The book arrived in Very poor condition despite the description claiming the book listed as ""good"". It took a long time to arrive. Very disappointed. It go two stars only because the book itself is fasinating."
2,I wasn't too happy with this tea kettle,"1. It came with a warning not to use it on high heat. Since the object is to boil water, that struck me as being ridiculous.2. The handle is advertised as heat-resistant. It doesn't get hot enough to burn your hand, but it does get hot enough to be uncomfortable to hold without a pot holder.3. The whistle worked exactly twice and then stopped producing sound."
5,Only book you'll need on C#,"I bought this book on the advice of a collegue at work. It is by far the best C# on the market. It takes you from no knowledge to expert in less than 1,000 pages."
5,This is the only C# book worth buying,"I bought this book and some of the MS, Wrox and O'Reilly books on C#. This one is the only one worth buying, and I read all the other ones bought. This book really stands out above the rest because it covers the C# language as well as ADO.NET and ASP.NET, along with web services.I really liked the no nonsense approach taken by the authors, and the coverage of advanced C# and .NET programming like threads, remoting and security. The book even introduces you to using and programming with SQL Server!The other C# I own stay at home on the bookshelf. Like I said at the start of this review, this is the only book I _actually_ use at my job."
1,Star Trek: Space Seed Kirk & Khan Action Figures,"These two action figures are horrible. They look nothing like the original action figures. Their clothes are some kind of hard plastic instead of cloth clothing. If you're looking for better Star Trek memorabilia, try retro Star Trek action figures. Would definitely not buy other Star Trek action figures by this manufacturer."
5,very pleased,"i bought at toys r us tried it out everything worked i ordered extra microphone which was a hassel hard to get thru on telephone, and was sold out but restocked several days later. the microphone arrived a slightly different shade of blue but close enough. i hope my grandaughters, 4 1/2 and 2 1/2 enjoy it as much as i did. this week it is on sale 25% off. the whole family can enjoy this gift."
2,"good item, bad quality","The dvd's contents are fabulous, however the quality stinks. It seems that it is a burned disc. It skips and staggers throughout. I was dissappointed about that."
3,Mugs don't match with the set,"I ordered this set becasue I love Corelle Livingware Dinnerwares. It's against cracks, chips, and breakage. It's white which goes with any other sets. However, those mugs come in the box are obvious not lining with this set. It's different materials, different marks, and heaiver. The color is different as well although it's not so obvious to notice. I wish Corelle can replace those mugs with trully Livingware Winter Frost mugs."
5,"Simple, elegant and inexpensive",It's a simple and light weight dinnerware. My husband and I both like them. We are thinking to buy another two sets.
1,"Corelle Dinnerware, broken, not all there","I ordered three sets of dinnerware for my daughter's birthday, Dec. 18. When they arrived one plate was totally broken, I could hear it rattling in the box. Another plate wasn't even the pattern that I had ordered. I contacted World Kitchen because it said to contact them not the place you had purchased it from. They told me they would send a replacement within 7-10 days, that was in November. On December 6th I sent them e-mail saying I still had not received my pieces. The e-mailed me back on Dec. 11 saying they had a leak in one of their glass tanks in October and as a result all Corelle tint patterns will be unavailable until June 2009. They asked me to allow a few extra weeks for the delivery of my item. It is now December 16th and I still haven't received my item. My biggest question is ""why didn't they tell me this when I called, instead of saying the items would be here in 7-10 days?"""
2,Cheap Dishes,These are very cheap dishes I am returning them because of that reason..feel like the old plastic dishes Sorry about that
4,Excellent and Durable,"I bought this set because I was tired of getting cheap plates at Target that always came with something broken in the box. These plates don't break and are extremely durable. I was so pleased with them that I bought a second set. However, the plates are not terribly decorative. I got around this by buying fancy place mats and napkins. I wouldn't propose these plates as wedding china, but for everyday use, they are superior."
1,Doesn't Work with 760 Chipsets,"I've had installation difficulties similar to other users: ""A device attached to the system is not functioning."" I tried to solve the problem to no avail, searching the website and contacting technical support.I'm using WinXP Pro, and whoever certified this as ""Designed for Windows XP"" made a cruel joke.*UPDATE*This device conflicts 760 chipsets which is just, plain sloppy engineering on the part of Dazzle. The 760 chipset is used in most AMD Athlon motherboards. THERE IS NO HARDWARE OR SOFTWARE FIX TO THIS PROBLEM OTHER THAN TO INSTALL THIS DEVICE ON AN INTEL MACHINE! If Dazzle is this sloppy in engineering, I've got to wonder what other poor quality products they produce. Personally, I'm never buying Dazzle again. I suggest you do likewise.Hence, I've downgraded my review to one star."
5,its a cartridge..,"it works, its genuine. as any ink, still overpriced. First one malfunctioned, would not register with the printer. Seller promptly troubleshoot the issue and sent replacement cartridge at no extra cost. happy printing, HP lovers! )"
4,What's the deal!,I agree with the last post. What the heck is the deal here on the whole set when it costs more to buy the whole set than the individual sets. Someone needs to go back to math class! Does the box it comes in cost $20 to make??? LOL
1,Absolutely Painful,"The unit itself is poorly built due to the fact that you must force the rca cables into it, that should've been the first clue. The software installed fine (Pinnacle version 8.0 initially). They capture quality is extremely choppy, this is especially true if you are filming any type of racing. The max resolution that it can capture and then give you a final product in is not even close to what you initially started with on either VCR or an analog camcorder. That being the case, what in the hell is the point of this product ?With a combination of poor resolution and what appears to be dropped frames(although during capture, I had zero dropped frames it says) this product is one big disappointment."
2,The stylish connectors make this a failed product.,"While there is nothing wrong with the functionality of this product... It does fail in a major way. The connectors are inset somewhat. Standard RCA cables do not fit into them, and only with force can you get them to rest delicately on the connectors, and they will function so long as you do not tug on or move them in any way. It was more than I could handle, and I decided to return it to get something a little less stylish and a little more functional, which is my suggestion to future buyers."
5,Extremely Illuminating,"I laughed when I read the title ""Doctrine of Demons"" from one of the reviewers. This is not breathed of Satan. Bevere draws all of his arguments from the Bible. It is controversial topics because of the democratic, PC, cynical, American, etc. atmosphere we live in. The Bible is controversial and counter-culture when properly applied. If God's word is in you than you have the gift of discernment and I discern that this is a great book but you may discern otherwise. It's a good read in my opinion."
5,Under Cover: The Promise of Protection Under His Authority,I love John Bevere as a speaker (he has visited our church a number of times). Reading his books is almost as good as having him in person. This book enlightened and convicted me. It is very important as Christians to truly understand spiritual authority. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to walk in obedience to God's Word and enjoy the best that God has to offer.
1,Someone karate chop this hypocrite,"Blue Racer: Say, isn't this man the charter member of The Dish it But Can't Take It Club. Japanese Beetle: Sure is Serpent Son. Blue Racer: Eminem(or as we call him phleghminem) is a white who thinks he's black. Japanese Beetle: This bigot made fun of Moby and then when Moby made fun of him back he got hot and bothered. Blue Racer: Rap is what John Entwistle once said crap. Japanese Beetle: This Vanilla Ice carbon-copy should be HAASAH(karate chops Eminem cardboard cut-out)ed out of here. Sayonara!"
4,"This CD was really bad, but....","This CD is really bad for anyone who says Eminem fell off after 'The Marshall Mathers LP'. Most of the songs on this CD are directed toward groupies. In my own opinion, I didn't buy this CD but by looking at the tracklist, I wouldn't enjoy this CD very much.I wish the bonus disc would of included songs he personally liked instead of the short 'Stans Mixtape', although.. I do like the songs on the bonus disc, but it's too short.This is alright for newer Eminem fans."
1,It's over for this fool.,"This album and this rapper has got to be the most overrated in recent music history, I'm glad that this guy is done, he paved the way for even more terrible rappers like 5-0 cent (I Refuse to call him 50 cent) and other terrible trash.I Hope this is his curtain call, because he will never get the respect again.Want a real white rapper listen to cage, if you want a real inspirational rapper of 2000's, check out Nas."
5,Real Slim Review,"eminem's curtain call:the hits must be on of his greatest cd's.Fack must be the funniest song ever written by the great one himself,Eminem.Ive listened to rap for about 8 years now that im 13 and once i hear slim shady PSA in the marshall mathers lp i knew i would definitley catch on to his music as his cd's went on he grew more and more popular to me and soon i had collected all his cd's and just about any picture hes in.him and his partners n crime D-12,dr.dre,50 cent,g-unit,nate dogg are the greatest rappers ive ever heard their music isnt just dope but its funny at the same time"
1,So eminem thinks he can rap,"Rap sucks so bad, but eminem is a level worse than the plague that is RAP."
3,And sellout of the year awards goes to...,"So what's up with those iPod commercials?!? We need an Eminem like he was when ""***in' Crazy"" came out, now that was decent. Methinks that the label wanted him to release an album as per his contract stated and since Marshall didn't have any new material he thought he would do the usual, release a greatest hits package. It's sad, such a talent!!!"
3,of course his old stuff is better,"you guys do realize that Em went downhill fast when Dre stopped bein involved and Em started taking over the production duties, right?"
2,Pretty Bull Shut album,There are many stupid songs off this album. How is Just Loose it on this album and songs like Bad meets Evil or gone. Whats up with the stupid song with Nate Dogg. I want to see Dre Beats which is freestyle rhymes of raps. Stupid tracklistings
5,great,"personally i dont think he is leavin..................yet. i think he will make one last album. he will be workin hard on this last album. this album is a good album obviously because it has all of his numba 1 hits. his new song WHEN IM GONE should not be on this album. this song is very good and it basically talkin about how he is always talkin about his daughter in his songs, yet he is ignorin her. she wants him 2 be with her instead of him leavin all da time. i think dis song should of been on his very last album. he just wasted it on this."
5,Perfect Fit,"I've always had good luck with FelPro gaskets, so when I had to replace the intake manifold on my 04 Mustang GT, these were a no-brainer. I'm glad I picked these up because the OE gaskets were in bad shape, so I threw these on and they fit perfectly."
1,Useless now,"Some one suggested me to buy this book for Subject Maths GRE. But as far as I know, this books has problems no way near to the original test, REA will be lot better to this."
2,Block Book,"There must have been water damage to the book, so while it is useable, the bottom edge is bumpy. However, it wasn't overly available so I'm glad to have it."
3,This is an average book.,This book is historical about where the Buddah traveled geographically. I had expected it to be more about the Buddhist religion.
3,"Deanna Durbin shines, even with below-par material","Deanna Durbin, one of Universal's biggest and highest-paid stars of the 1940s, definitely deserved better than this, although she does manage to shine in a few scenes (especially when singing ""It's Dreamtime""). Everything in the film, from the dialogue, to the comedy, and even the songs, seem average at best (which, sadly, was all too common in her later films). Adolphe Menjou, William Bendix, and especially Tom Drake do well in supporting roles. All in all, not one of Deanna's best films, although definitely worth the price of the video for fans of the divine Miss Durbin!"
4,Just like the original,"Super Mario is always fun, even in a small screen format. The package of games is a real value."
5,Super Mario World - need I say more?,"Really, should I? If so: this is probably the ultimate Mario game! The levels are huge, the enemies, at times looney, are often entertaining and challenging, and you go to ride around on a tiny T-rex who had a tendency to devour enemies whole. Not to mention those Dragon Coins which beckoned to the novice item collector and tried the patience of many a hardcore gamer, I'm sure. Virtually everything is true to the original version. So what are you waiting for? BUY THIS GAME!"
3,Buy Sympathetique instead!,"There are a few good tunes in ""Hey Eugene"". But for the most part, I can't recommend it. China Forbes and bandleader Thomas Lauderdale do their best to keep the boat afloat with their cozy blend of pop cabaret, jazz, and latin-tinged tunes. You could do a whole lot worse than ""Hey Eugene"". If you want your senses dazzled buy Sympathique. It's marvelous!"
2,Nothing really new here,"While the first two albums from Pink Martini were real stand outs each with their own flavor, the latest release shows signs of creative drought. Or more likely, pressure to produce when new ideas haven't been fully formed. Not to say the quality is bad; this album has the characteristic high quality musicianship of all their efforts. I still love their sound, and their live performances are not to be missed. Maybe the next album will break new ground..."
5,Wonderful Pink Martini!,"If you want an album that can be played over and over again, this is it! There is so much depth and continuation of the bands first CD's that will make this CD a classic. It should be on everyone's list!"
1,Father of Modern Linguistics?,"This is what the Amazon reviewer says. No, he is the father of the anti-American leftists. You want proof you all are nuts? Hugo Chavez, a thug by anyone's rational definition, recommends this book, and you all rush to buy. In order to be Imperialist, one must crush resistance with force. Instead, we host the biggest thug-fest in years, the UN Opening Week, and foot the bill for lunch. Suggest you all review the history of political openness in Cuba before slamming your own country.Sigh. Unfortunately, in order to learn, one must have ears to hear, eyes to see."
1,Avoid like the plague...unless you're a cut-n-run liberal,"this book is for those who hate america and hate themselves. they want to believe that their country is an evil power so they can ease their guilty conscience about living in a capitalistic society. they walk around with self imposed guilt and shame and preach about how we should move toward socialism, all the while enjoying the benefits of capitalism, unable to abstain (or unwilling?)"
3,Ignorance is bliss,"Sometimes it's not stupidity that causes someone to turn the blind eye.While informative, at times this book is simply a little depressing.Don't misunderstand - someone's got to fight these battles and what-not, but there are some (of us) who don't have the mental strength to rise above our own daily problems to give a lot of consideration to global or essoteric issues - beyond the customary ""Politicians lies"" etc."
4,"Substantive, articulate and not what Americans want to hear.",Turn off Survivor and educate yourself.
4,Hegemony or Survival a Great Insight into Imperialist Policy,Hegemony or Survival by Noam Chomsky provides an excellent historical background to the imperialistic policies that our government has executed in our name --- especially over the last six years.
5,Greatest living intellectual,"Noam Chomsky may or may not be the world's greatest living intellectual, but he is the most cited in scholarly literature. Seeing world history through Chomsky's prism is one of the most liberating experiences in the study of history. Clarity, lack of an agenda, honesty and utter commitment to parsing the motives and means of control in global social systems makes his addition to our understanding of class struggles and warfare utterly indispensible. Among his many titles, this one is not to be missed."
2,Typical Chomsky,"Chomsky's problem has always been the white heat of his polemic words. His red-meat rhetoric completely overshadows the more intelligent of his critques of America. The result has always been a small but noisy following, adored by extremists but ultimately having zero impact on policy or society.He needs a good editor. Cutting back on the hate speech would get him read by a wider audience.."
3,"Should have been more careful with his ""facts""","The book is OK. However, blatant mistakes have been made with so-called ""facts"". One prime example is to talk about the alleged armenian genocide by the ottoman empire. If you use so-called ""facts"" to make your case without validating if they are actually ""facts"", your case becomes moot and you lose your reader's respect."
1,Problems with motherboards with VIA chipset,"It seems that this is a real problem. This card doesn't work with most VIA chipsets (that means AMD processors). My computer freeze often and only the reset button is available :).I tryed all the drivers found on Internet. The results are negative. So, there is anybody who wants to buy a lazy soundblaster? I think this is the worst soundblaster I had."
2,its working,"I bought one to just see if it would sound better than the standard mac sound. It seems to be, from what ive done with it so far. I also wanted to have an extra input to record with but I havent tried using that yet.I gave it two stars because its been crashing pretty often. Maybe more so after I updated the driver. Nothing for os x. Anyway its about as good as can be expected for the price."
5,A Fabulous Compilation!!,"The first review pretty much says it all, we just wanted to add our stars. My family and I are big Harry Potter fans and when it was time for my daughter's birthday, she requested a CD of Harry Potter music. There were several different pieces of which she was particularly fond of and this was the only CD that seemed to have nearly all of them. If there's one thing that she misses, it's the song ""Something Wicked This Way Comes"" from the POA film. Some of the melody is included in the POA suite but she really wanted to sing along.This CD plays almost constantly in our car's CD system and the kids have a great time remembering what parts of the movies each piece is from. If you're looking for a Harry Potter CD that represents a bit of the best from each of the first four movies, this is it. The quality is outstanding as well."
5,Harry Potter Music Magic!,Beautiful tracks from the first 4 movies. Great to listen to while driving or cooking or just wanting to relax. Very well done!
5,Dom Casmurro - art in paper,"Dom Casmurro is simply a book that can be called by ""really art"". Machado de Assis uses all his culture and sense in a realistic history. Simply the best."
4,Great for book reports,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book! I especially recommend this book for a book report ... there are so many plots, themes and morals to discuss. It was a bit slow in the beginning, but it is a great book otherwise!"
5,Still a good book years after I first read it!,"I first read Wolf by the Ears in grade school. Since then I've read it at least once a year. It's an excellant book that made me feel as if I was on Thomas Jefferson's plantation with Harriet Hemmings. I still get choked up reading it and probably always will because I feel as though Harriet is my friend. Wolf by the Ears made me want to read more about the Hemmings family and Thomas Jefferson. Of the other two novels that I have read about Sally and Harriet Hemmings, Wolf by the Ears is my favorite!"
3,Can't play it yet,"Have a Acer tablet, still learning how it works. Nothing like picking up something a tad naughty to experiment on!"
2,Smash,Not a good adult film. No real story line and very minimal action. It really was about volleyball but no hot scrans at all.
1,smash bad,"boarding, dose not interest me. boarding, dose not interest me , back ground look so fake or realistic , bake effects. bad acting,"
4,tight-fitting cover really puts the embers out!,"Just bought a wood-burning fireplace insert this winter and this is ideal! Was using regular metal pail and even overnight in below freezing weather, there would still be embers; problem solved!!"
4,locking lid can,The first locking lid can had a broken handle on the lid and the company made it good by sending me a new locking lid can. Very satisfied with item.
1,not waterproof...,"I see now that it says dry storage only, but I ordered them before I saw that. Who the hell wants a bucket that doesn't hold water?"
2,very annoying stickers,"I just received this garbage can a few days ago. The can is exactly as it appears in the picture, however, the ""Behrens"" logo on the front is not a stamped metal piece. It is an annoying sticker that is super sticky. In other words, it is a hassle to peel off. I had to use windex and a razor. The most annoying thing about this garbage can is that it comes with a 7 inch ""Made in USA"" sticker that is even tougher to remove. Don't get me wrong, I drive a Ford and love things made in the USA. I just think it is super obnoxious to put an ugly 7 inch sticker on the garbage can. I would NOT buy this garbage can again even though it probably operates properly. If it doesn't, I'll update this review later."
4,Works well,"I use this bucket to put the ashes from my fireplace in. It serves its purpose and holds alot of ash. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that when the lid is on, it is slightly difficult to raise the handle up. It kind of sticks. It's really not a big deal, and I still recommend this product but it's enough to keep it from getting 5 stars."
3,Using for compost,"I was looking around for a small outdoor compost and found this can with a lid. I figured I could drill some holes in it and voila, a little composter. The first shipment arrived without the lid, but Amazon kindly and quickly shipped me another one. I drilled the holes and put my compost materials in it. Seems to be perfect for the job and not an eyesore like a plastic garbage bin. The only problem is that the lid does not fit very well. It's quite hard to get on and off and the locking handle does not pull up around the lid. I had already drilled the holes, so can't return it. I'm still using it for my compost and it seems to be working fine. If you plan to take the lid off regularly, this might not be for you."
3,Leaks / But keeps the rats out,"I had to get these to protect our chicken feed from the ratts because they chewed holes into our Vittles Vaults within a year. I had such high hopes. But when I left these outside, the rain leaked in through the top where the handle is connected and all my feed rotted. Now I have to put a bag over the top to prevent that problem. I guess you can just keep them inside or under an overhang as well, but that's a little bit of a pain."
3,Garbage Can,It was a little wider than I expected. Getting the handle up and down was hard. It seems very stiff. Maybe it will get better with time.I do like that is was made in the USA!!!
3,Not as funny as the publisher thinks it is.,"Lisa Scottoline is billed as a mystery author who can write thrilling plots with interesting characters. Unfortunately, in ""Running from the Law"", Scottoline's main character, Rita Morrone, is not as interesting or funny as are nearly all the other characters including the ones who get killed. Rita does such stupid, unethical things, while ascribing stupidity and venality to other characters, that I sometimes wanted to kill her myself.The authorial use of unspoken comments by Rita that are diametrically opposed to her spoken comments is cute at first, but it gets a bit old after a while."
5,A good murder mystery.,"Enjoyed listening to RUNNING FROM THE LAW by LisaScottoline . . . this is a fast-paced novel about Rita Morrone, alawyer who takes on the defense of a distinguished federal judgeaccused of sexual harassment . . . when the judge's youngsecretary is then found murdered, he becomes a prime suspect.There's a good plot here, as well as catchy dialogue . . . I liked the ending, too . . . and the fact that the story is set in Philadelphia added to my enjoyment.Karen Allen did the narration . . . she starred in one of myfavorite all-time films, STARMAN . . . however, her work hereis only fair at best."
4,This book is fast-paced but a little unrealistic.,"To read Running From the Law is to enter the reality of a driven woman lawyer. Although exciting, fast-paced, and fun to read--taking only a few hours--the main character, Rita Morrone, comes perilously close to caricature. The plot is one of crime and mystery, and the surprise ""who done it?"" is elegantly structured. There is no lawyer like Rita who would represent her lover's father, a federal judge, on a murder charge, especially after finding out how her (ex) lover figured into the plot"
2,Skip It,"These are 2 short stories that are reprinted here in time for Christmas - ""Home for Christmas"" and ""All I Want for Christmas."" The stories are exceptionally short, and although they are cutesy, they really aren't worth reading. Home for Christmas is about a man who returns to his hometown after being gone for 10 years and starts up again with his old girlfriend. The second story, All I Want for Christmas, is a bit better and is about twin boys who set about matchmaking for their father."
3,Not Pink Slip but good.,I read this book because I absolutely fell in love with Lisa and Eben in Pink Slip. Pink Slip left me in a pensive mood and I thought about it for days after reading it.I can't say the same for this sequel. I did enjoy this book it was very funny and quite a look at parenthood as it sometimes seems..........frustrating. The book is narrated by both Lisa and Eben in alternating chapters and was interesting to see each ones take on their situation but this book lacked the spark that Pink Slip had even though I still am in love with these Characters.
2,Zina,"I've read all of Rita Cerisi's books and enjoyed her references to the Greater New Haven area, as well as her characters' insights on growing up in a traditional, albeit dysfunctional Italian family. Pink Slip was indeed my favorite work of hers. I was greatly dissapointed to find in this sequel piece, no references to Lisa's growing up or family, which so greatly influenced her past. I did not enjoy reading about Ebb's gastrointestinal problems, nor their son's excessive snoring. The book as a whole was an unfortunately boring read."
2,A real disappointment,"It's hard to believe this tedious novel was written by the same author who crafted the artful stories in ""Sometimes I Dream in Italian"" or the entertaining ""Pink Slip."" This book drags on with meaningless detail from it's boring beginning to its unsatisfying end."
5,Worth the Read,"This was a very good book and it makes you wonder how a husband and father can be so evil, the epitomy of Satan himself almost. The author is a very brave woman and the book is well worth reading. I think I would have gone insane with the abuse she and her siblings suffered. It's a real eye opener too."
2,Nouveau Flamenco,"There are some brutal reviews here. If you enjoy easy listening, then Nouveau Flamenco will satisfy. But I have to thank the reviewers who pounded Ottmar mercilessly yet recommended Paco de Lucia and Gerardo Nunez. Both play with amazing ability and the traditional flamenco is far richer than nouveau. ""Entre Dos Aguas"" and ""Antologia Vol 2"" by Paco de Lucia and ""El Gallo Azul"" and ""Flamencos in New York"" by Gerardo Nunez are highly recommended. Even though they are brief, the samples offered on Amazon will give you an idea of the flavor you are missing with Ottmar."
4,This one cd changed my appreciation of guitar forever,"Poetry by music elegantly describes this warm and romantic release. No purist ""Andalusion"" pretentions here as Ottmar warmly and sincerely interprets his musical vision. Few other artists deliver to the heart as effectively as Ottmar. If you want hectic, fast paced string pounding, buy Paco DeLucia by all means. If your looking instead to expand the vocabulary of your heart and soul, Ottmar is my recommendation."
2,Don't Understand the Hype,"If I could give it a 2.5 stars I would so it's right in the middle. This isn't a bad story, but it's not as compelling as the number of 5 star reviews would suggest. It was an easy read, but the artwork was not my favorite- i don't know how else to describe it except it looked immature. it's a very basic story and hey if i had a kid i'd totally read it to him or her as a bed time story but for an older audience it fell a bit flat. sorry if i offend anyone who thinks the world of this book i really tried/wanted to like it i just couldn't."
3,"Average performance, terrible reliability",I've gone through 2 of these so far. The modem works great for 4 months then there is intermittent packet loss. Eventually it happens every 10-15 minutes. Since they are leased by the cable company they replace them for free. If I was to purchase one I'd go with a more trustworthy brand like Motorola.
1,Not that good,"I found this book difficult, too time consuming and too much effort. I have a life to lead and I kinda read at what point the author saying in the book that it would take more or less a life time to get through this book and I remember thinking that why must that be so to heal the inner child within, I just found it too stressful and useless when it came to dealing with the problems of inner child work."
2,Pretty disappointing,"I bought this set so I wouldn't have to run to the hardware store when I needed to fix something. Well, the set comes with about the weirdest hardware you've ever seen. The biggest sizes are small and the small stuff is approaching something a watch-maker might need (okay, maybe that's an exaggeration). The nuts are really thin and hard to grab with a wrench. Ironically the case is flimsy, but the covers are a bear to open. The dividers inside don't stay down so when you're trying to wrestle the thing open all the hardware inside gets mixed up into a mess.The only redeeming value of this set is the price and the fact that I have been able to use the bolts in a few isolated instances."
3,Could have been better,This is a good LP. She has a good voice and a lot of promise. Unfortunately this album is ruined by the orchestration. Just leave her alone to sing and it will be much better. Also eliminate some of the silly songs like Mockingbird and Aphrodesiac.
1,What a voice!,"I won't point out all the bad things about her voice. However, truely I can't listen to her for a longer while and it's becouse of that squawking (sorry, couldn't help) voice.It's definitely not the another definition of silence..."
2,Listen to the cuts first,"I bought this CD on the strength of hearing Ms. Melua sing ""The Closest Thing to Crazy"" on the Craig Ferguson Show. She was backed by a three piece and the stripped down, sultry effect sent chills up my spine. HOWEVER, upon getting the CD,it is a fully orchestrated, over produced piece of crap. Most of the songs are OK and you can see the potential, but the producer should be shot. It is not at all what I expected and is gathering dust in a cabinet. I have resolved to never buy another CD without sampling the tracks. Lesson learned."
1,"Sounds Like Mandy Barnett, era; via 1996...","From the styling to the inflection, I think we've ""been there, done that"". One star for styling, one star for some cute vocalize. Just a reflection of the uninspirationally bland state of blues today. Attn: Diana Krall, Norah Jones... here's Katie."
5,Regina Spektor meets broadway!,"Her vocals are incredible! She has a magical voice that casts a spell on you and doesn't let go. I initially heard her on the radio at a cafe in Edinburgh. A couple months later, I saw a review in a Chicago paper. Bought the CD and came home. I spent weeks listening to her and buying up the rest of her songs. She has a very impressive range, genuine spirit that shines through in her songs. Truly someone I would pay to see over and over!"
5,katie melua my guardian angel,this is my favorite cd purchase of the year on amazon.comkatie melua is an amazing discovery.
2,Great singer mediocre album,"I bought this album after seeing a feature on her on A&E;, where she played acoustically and sang beautifully.She has a beautiful voice, and probably has a lot of potential as an artist. When I heard her sing alone, she sounded excellent.Unfortunately, I have never heard a blues band with less soul than the group of studio musicians that accompanies her on this album. On some tracks the orchestration drowns out the vocal, and on other tracks her beautiful voice is just swimming in reverb, making this album come off sounding like an amatureish demo recording.She has the potential to sing and play like Susan Tedeschi, but unless she finds a better backing band and a better producer, she will probably continue to be compared to Norah Jones."
4,"Fast delivery, good price, strange odor",The case looks good although the foam molding under the black material did not appear very solid. The other issue was an odor that smelled very much like a sweet unsmoked cigar. Very strong but reduced after a couple of weeks leaving the case open
3,Bottle better than the filter,"I was looking for an environmentally conscious, safe, resuable water bottle. The filter was just going to be a bonus. However, the filter seems to interfere with getting a nice big sip of water. I may keep looking for the perfect environmental water bottle."
3,works...for a while,I bought some of these and some of the Bobble type. The Bobbles were more expensive but lasted much longer. These lasted about one week of use...then either started to leak or filter would just snap off.
4,Everything Tori and never released songs!,"Well put together. Songs carefully selected. Piano box with ivory keys stunning, but only if you're a collector....without it the set might have been cheaper. The new songs are great, although I thought it was too few.A lovely booklet with explanations of some songs,and about her different albums and career, but I thought it could have been more detailed. People that knows nothing about Tori Amos will get to know what makes her tick as a wide range of songs were chosen over her career. But,fans might find this a bit disappointing as we wanted more b-sides! For die-hard fans: This is a must have! Your collection just won't be complete without it."
4,An underrated classical piano recital.,"Eliane Elias has made her name in the jazz field with some serious knuckle crunching jazz chops. After several successful albums for Blue Note, she suddenly released this album (on the EMI classical label) in 1993. And it is really very good indeed. She pays tribute to her countryman, Heitor Villa Lobos with 6 compositions, gives an above average performance of the Ravel Sonatine, and includes some Chopin mazurkas. The high point is her very bright rendition of Sebastian Bach's French Suite No. 5. I recommend this recording overall, and in particular for the Bach."
5,Delicious stuff!,"This is very good. I live a few hours from Nueske's and have been lucky enough to pick up ""ends"" of this Landjaeger at a reduced price. It is a bit like beef sticks, but they are not round and almost seem handformed. The thickest parts are juicy, the narrower parts are chewier and it makes for a great snack. They have a slight spice to them, probably just short of being called ""spicy"". Let's call them a bit peppery. In the Nueske store, they cost 7.99 lb and that seems very high to me, but when I think about what jerkies and beef sticks cost by the pound, it's probably very reasonable. The package says that 1 oz has 5 grams of fat, 8 grams of protein and 2 grams of carb. Great for low-carb people."
1,worthless!!,"It's too small, no room for the 12V power supply. Haven't found any use for it. Should have returned it."
3,GPS case,The GPS fits well into this case but it lacks protective padding. It most likely would not protect your GPS if you were to drop it. There are many after market cases that would do a much better job of protecting your investment.
2,a bit confusing,"The official Garmin bag offers less protection for the unit than the makeshift one I made. A half inch of foam in the bottom improved it somewhat, at the expense of storage. Still it makes for an acceptable carrying case. particularly for concealing it in a car when not in use."
3,A perfect fit,"This bag was a perfect fit for our street pilot, however the bag is thin with very little padding so we ended up putting it in a bigger bag to protect it while not in use."
3,"Good product, but not well thought out.","The problem with this case is that it will NOT hold the GPS, speaker/plug and dashboard mount at the same time. If you don't pack the the mount it will work just fine, if you want to take everything from vehicle to vehicle and don't have permanent mounting brackets you'll be carrying two items, the mount and the bag. Otherwise it is reasonably well made but could use more padding on the bottom."
3,"carry case, garmin carrying case",Not needed. Would like to see a case large enough to include ALL items appropriate to Garmin i5 GPS. We prefer to keep computer CD w/ GPS unit (in event something happens). Computer disk does not fit in case & allow it to zip. However EVERYTHING ELSE FITS.
3,Carrying Bag,The carrying case seems to be just the right size to carry the proper equipment when traveling. Not too bulky
3,Garmin Deluxe Carrying Case,"The Garmin Deluxe Carrying Case for Street Pilot is well made, but is too small to accomodate much other than the basic Street Pilot. If you want a bag large enough to hold the Street Pilot 2720 plus accessories such as dash board pad, 12-Volt adapter, and A/C adapter, you may want another bag."
1,Very disappointed with Garmin Deluxe Carrying Case,"I bought one of these Garmin StreetPilot carrying case and was very disappointed, as this case provides no interior foam padding to cushion any external force. I ended up returning this case and bought one of the Gilsson's Neoprene Carrying Case for the Garmin StreetPilot III, Quest and 2610 GPS receivers. I really liked the Gilsson case, you ought to consider it. www.gilsson.com"
5,(put down the bong for a minute and rock),"The variety of rock-n-roll in this collection is both catchy-n-exciting and deep-n-masterful. Echoing with reverb and pounding with energy, Blue Cathedral is the album that you can play for your parents, but maybe you really shouldn't. Yeah, maybe this reminds you of a couple of your dad's old records, but it won't remind you of any of his newer CD's. (Sting?! Kenny G?! What the F^%#!) No, Comets on Fire are rockin' in the now . . . keeping it new and fresh for smart heads who wants some noisy fun."
1,the worse phone EVER,SO all u need to know is this is the worse phone! Ur whole point in buying a phone is calling people well unless u want to only talkto someone for ten minutes dont get this thing! This phone has broken on me for the past year! Both stopped charging.
2,Poor Reception Phone,The voice quality is poor. The reception is poor. The ring volume is low. Features are good. battery life is very good.
1,Stay away,"I've had this phone for over two years now, and i advise you stay away from it for the following reasons:1. The camera gets turned on accidently in the closed position every couple of minutes, leaving you with a burning sensation on your leg and no battery.2. The ""speakerphone"" feature is only useful because the standard volume turned up to max is barely hearable.3. Saying the picture quality sucks would be a compliment.4. Bad reception5. The Durability of a fully charged battery when the phone is in use is at most 30 minutes.6. If the phone is off, and someone calls you, it won't inform you that you have missed a call when the phone is turned back on.So anyway, this may seem like a cool phone and a good buy. Trust me, it's not. I'm waiting axiously for tuesday to roll around so i can get my new phone. so take my advice and stay away!"
2,Nice Design but Horrible Camera Concept,I bought this phone along with a different brand for my wife mainly because of the design and ignored some of the warnings from various reviewers.My pros are:- Nice Exterior.- Simple to use.- Decent Picture QualityThe Cons:- They thought at Audiovox to put a button on the outside of the camera to take sublight pictures. VERY BAD IDEA. This goes on all the time and drains the battery without my knowledge.- The phone heats up after about 5 mn conversation.- Unstable Signal strength (I know it is not the carrier because my wife has an LGE with the same carrier and does not have the same problem).- No Free Games (not even) Snake??? (I know they want us to pay for it but we should at least have some).
2,Should have waited on this one.....,"This game is a waste of time, the graphics are lame and the story line sucks."
5,Great Game!,Great Game!! The detail is Great and the gameplay is well paced. Here's hoping for an expansion!
3,Another of Microsoft's unwanted stepchildren,"The game is old enough to still come on a stack of CDs rather than a DVD, and the support for the game is dismal. Between Microsoft's lackluster marketing attempts, and the difficulty experienced by hundreds, including myself, to apply patches, this game was clearly an afterthought to Microsoft. The campaigns storyline is engaging, and the gameplay is a fun twist on a tired theme. The added gameplay elements manage to be complex without being complicated. Sadly, the storyline is halting and sporadic. The cut scenes feel ill timed and disruptive. It feels rushed, as if the production budget were cut. Between this and that the terrible support, this is a good title, but belongs in the bargain bin."
2,A significant disappointment,"Stopped playing after 1/3 the way through. Why bother. I have consistenly not liked the MS games anyway so I guess I should not have been surprised. There are many with opinions contrary to mine so I guess my best adivce is to see if there is a demo and if so, download an play it first. Maybe it will suite your tastes.Hail Flavius!"
4,Whats up with the 2 second shutter delay?,Here is the shutter specs right from sony:Maximum shutter speed: .001 secondsMinimum shutter speed: 2 secondsSo why are people complaining about the shutte speed? Isn't it something that you can adjust?
4,From novice to expert,"The iPod Book: Doing Cool Stuff with the iPod and the iTunes Music Store (2nd Edition)Having purchased quit a few Scott Kelby books and not even knowing how to turn an ipod on,I once again put my trust in Scott for my introduction into the world of ipod. True to form, Scott, along with his usual humour and plain instructional writing, I can now mix with the experts in ipod technology. A very good easy read."
5,Easy to use resource for the non-tech savvy,"I bought this book because of the format - each page has a set of instructions for how to do one thing, ensuring that it is kept simple and concise. I have had a video iPod since Christmas 2005 and could figure out enough to make playlists, download, and rip but knew no other tricks. My library now looks cleaner, misspelled titles/artists are now corrected, and I know how to better organize my over 6000 songs.Excellent resource and easy-to-use. It's worth every penny."
1,not worth the money,"I was very disappointed in this book, which really doesn't even contain as much information as the online manual. I bought it when I was having trouble with my iPod and needed to know more than the manual explained; I know there are good books out there with this information, but this is definitely not one of them. For example, there are five steps listed in the manual that you can go through in order to reset or restore an errant iPod; this book lists only the first, simplest step, and never even mentions the possibility that it might not fix the problem, much less what to do in that case. Don't waste your money on this one."
4,3rd Edition iPod Book,"As an ipod nut i'm always interested in getting the most out of them & the iTunes Music Store. I found this edition up to date with the current iPod models & the latest version of the ITS. I've had several iPods over the years but a lot of people are new to the whole experience. I purchased 3 copies, 1 for me & 2 for friends just learning iPoding. The book is well layed out, has wonderful graphics & concise information. The authors comments just ad to the flavor of the book. New or old anyone with an iPod will find this book useful & refer back to it constantly."
3,get Decimation Blvd.,"Well, after the blitzkrieg carnage that was Decimation Blvd, I decided to check out this release, and unfortunately it's not up to snuff. The songs are slower and the aggression is toned down. I recommend Decimation Blvd and the live CD to get the full throttle assault...it's good stuff!!"
5,An epic lives on .,"Twilight Zone:The Movie is like the series , with a modern day twist. The prologe is a very unique story.Nor mal people in an every day world and then BANG, they've entered th twilight zone. Segment 1 shows what the power of predjudice can have..... and its conseqences.Segment 4 is a five star winner. Lithgowe gives a excellent performance.You can actually feel his emotional agony,fear,and confusion as he wonders what is outside his airplane window.In my opinion , he gave a Oscar deserved performance.Back to the begining segment 2 shows the joy of youth and segment 3 shows what an attention loving boy can do . Twilight Zone:The Movie is a instant classic in my books.You can be fully satisfied owning this movie."
4,"Fast, wicked and fun","While I enjoyed Julie's first two books more than I did Untitled - this one is still fast-paced and fun (maybe a little to much action in this one).Alex Plumtree is at it again and in up to his neck - this book is about incunable's (a book printed in the cradle method before 1500 - I think).Murder, mystery, intrigue and terrorists? Sounds a little crazy but Julie Kaewert makes them work. Strap yourself in - this one takes off at breakneck speed!"
4,Twists & turns galore.....,"As a fan of ""books about books"", I was excited to discover the existence of Kaewert's series. ""Untitled"" is jam-packed with literary allusions and plot twists, making it eminently readable. Be forewarned that it crams a slightly excessive number of plot twists into its pages--it may be difficult to figure out the motivations behind all the characters' actions.A helpful hint: Buy the sequel once you start getting near the end of this one. I sincerely hope that it resolves the cliff-hanger ending of this title!"
3,"Fun, but unfinished","Tenamonya Voyagers has all the makings of a great series. Likable characters, outstanding animation, a fun storyline, and hilarious humor. So why a mere 3 stars? Because Tenamonya Voyagers feels like a show that was supposed to be 26 episodes but got cancelled after 4. There is no ending and there are 4-5 plots that had yet to be tied up, and from all indications, this is the one and only DVD. There are many anime series that have told a good complete story in four episodes or less, Birdy The Mighty, Combustible Campus Guardress, Blue Submarine No. 6, just to name a few. So I don't see why Tenamonya Voyagers couldn't pull it off considering it was a joint venture between anime powerhouses Bandai, Studio Peirot and AIC. It's really unfortunate since there was a lot of potential."
3,"Too thin, not enough for accesories","It's a nice bag for your notebook only. It looked nice, but the space inside is not enough if you have many accesories such as 3.5 disk. I bought one, but i was forced to buy another because i have many accesories"
4,"Referrals, Referrals, RFeferrals","Outstanding book, not the same old thing as a lot of the referral business development books. I am working my way through this book and I am up to number 15, so far most of the methods do work quite well. I have eliminated some of the ideas and I already do about 1/4 of them. I will update the Realtors on what ideas worked especially good for me, here in Storm Lake Iowa."
2,So-so,"The material in the book is useful for an introduction to riding, yet it seemed that the book was a poor written version of Proficient Motorcycling. There are many occasions in which the author states material off of Proficient Motorcycling almost word by word. Book is ok, vaque in some parts, yet there are many better books out there with a more in depth introduction to riding."
3,the gospel road dvd,This was a gift for a Johnny Cash lover...I really don't think she was well pleased with the dvd. But she did say it was ok..
3,Product Info,"This is for the 1800 series or other specific series alone even though the in the technical description states that thelaptop compatibility as Compaq.This does not have a USB interface to the laptop.Otherwise, the features in the docking station are excellent."
1,Whatever,"I did not enjoy this CD, boring, droning hard rock, not good at all, why so many people liked it is beyond me, of course lots of people listen to Crud, I mean Creed."
5,A must have for worn out axle bearings,"Well, not a must have, but a very nice to have. You can use a 3/4 inch round 6 foot long piece of galvanized to stick through the axle, catch the lip on the other side and pound them out, but this method is so much more graceful. Just make sure you have a quality slide hammer with the proper threads, the hammer from Harbour freight had different threads!One piece of advice when using these: REMOVE THE AXLE SEAL FIRST! If you dont remove the seal first you will just pound away and get nowhere. With the seal pried out, the bearings comes out with a dozen or so pulls from the slide hammer. I like that they come with a case also."
1,This book covers more regarding Office 97 than FrontPage.,"I purchased this book almost explicitly to learn about database connectivity. In that light, it did aid in my understanding of how to make Access and FrontPage97 work together. The book was a disappointment, however, since more time was devoted to how to use Word, Excel, Powerpoint, Access, and Publisher to publish to the web than how to use FrontPage 97. It's definitely NOT worth the money."
1,Not concise,"The book spends a lot of your time and it's space going through exactly which menu button to hit, but misses completely on overview, concepts, and reference. It's written as though the target audience were new to computers. Very hard to find specific information without reading the whole book - a boring prospect."
2,I really wanted to like it...I did.,"I just couldn't bring myself to do it. It took me several sittings to get through it the first time. Then I thought maybe I wasn't being fair to it so when some friends were over this past weekend we watched it together (all of them Miike fans too). The group consensus was that while we appreciated what he was trying to do with this, it just wasn't for us. I always find a bit of humor in most Miike films, no matter how sick. This just felt more like a Kung Fu Hustle type of deal, which isn't a bad thing but isn't my bag. The drama was also just a little overwrought in places. I couldn't really deal with the bad dialogue either, I'm not sure if that is supposed to be an homage to Sergio Leone filsm or what, but it was really distracting. We had to go back more than a few times to catch what characters were saying, and finally just gave up and put subtitles on. I'm not sorry I saw it, it's just not what I was hoping it would be."
4,sukiyaki django,a great movie enjoyed it from beginning to end. highly recommend toeveryone that loves these type of movies.
2,Tarantino has lost it,"I know Tarantino's sthick is to re-invent the drive-in and spaghetti western genre. Here, he misses the mark with bizarre scenes and a garbled mess. It was almost unwatchable. I guess you either love it or hate it."
2,Arrrgggghhhh,Talk about parodies of movies...An endless stream of one liners/special effects/stunts parodying the spaghetti western and hong kong chinese Kung Fu movies...Minimally entertaining.
4,A Great and Bizarre Western Mash-up!,"I really enjoyed Sukiyaki Western Django. The movie was shot beautifully and the action sequences are thrilling and fun. You'll see some regular characters and plenty of bizarre characters; Quentin Tarantino makes a fun and noteworthy appearance; I also enjoyed the schizophrenic Sheriff Hoanka, he added a couple of funny moments. The acting was fine and the music was great. Not Takashi Miike's best work, but definitely worth watching for fans of this amazing director.I highly recommend Sukiyaki Western Django; it has amazing action, some comedy, some drama, and a powerful message. As of 7/30/12, this movie is available on Netflix Streaming, but may be expiring soon.This movie has strong violence and gore, and two brief sex scenes (no nudity is shown)."
5,Zombie classic,"What can you say about a movie populated with truly blood-thirsty zombies, strippers that turn into zombies and one of them is Jenna Jameson? Don't expect a lot of sparkling dialog but do expect lots of innovative ways to kill zombies !Certainly not a movie for the kids, the squeamish or the prudish this film is not quite on par with ""Planet Terror"" but it was almost as much fun as watching Rose McGowan splattering zombies with her M-16/Grenade launching artifical leg. Overall I was quite surprised, the special effects were top notch ""Zombie-Rama"" quality.So if you are a fan of camp, 70's style, exploitation, blood and guts fests with the obligatory gratuitous nudity (and who isn't LOL) you won't be disappointed. The take off on the ping pong ball scene from ""The Adventures of Priscilla Queen of the Desert"" alone makes this disc worth the price of admission."
1,Jenna... Eat a Sandwich,"This movie was pure garbage plain and simple but it was kind of funny garbage. The one glaring thing about the movie that I noticed the most, other than that it was horrible, was that Jenna Jameson is so skinny and has lost so much weight that she barely resembles the hot girl she once was. If you took a concentration camp victim, put her in a tanning bed, gave her breast implants and duck lips and makeup you have the modern day Jenna Jameson. For much of the movie she has her hair covering half of her face which is good because she has plastic surgeried and starved herself into being repulsive looking."
4,So Bad It's Awesome!,"What a fantastic 'B' horror flick. Tons of gratuitous blood, guts, gore and partial nudity. A true ""must-have"" for bad zombie flick aficionados! The plot is pretty self-explanatory. The blood and guts is over-the-top, and the acting is so bad it is hilarious. Make sure to have a few drinks before sitting down with some friends to watch this soon-to-be classic abomination. So bad it's great!"
4,Funny as hell...,... and gross to the max.I rented that movie when it came out on DVD and it cracked me up so much that I've decided to buy in on BR
3,"Close, but so afar away.","The setup was easy and the pictures are decent - what you would expect from a low end digital camera. I am assuming with 4AA's the batery life will be much better than other units out there. The 2x zoom is not usable and to surf through the menus is cumbersome, but the kicker is that the mp3 playback quality is an absolute joke. Do not buy this to listen to music...."
5,Don't get confused by these reviews,"I was confused when looking for the greek and english version of this book because Amazon carries both the greek and english version plus the english only version. However, the reviews for the two books are exactly the same. The greek and english version has the ISBN# 3438054051 and is 700+ pages, where the english only version has a different ISBN# is has half the number of pages. Hope this helps you in your buying and saves you the 15 minutes I lost scratching my head."
3,goat puppet,The quality is good and the puppet is very cute. The mouth is very stiff and hard to move. All of the Folkmanis puppets have the same problem. They ARE PUPPETS! The mouth should move!! Otherwise you could buy a stuffed animal.
3,cute puppet,"I use this at my farm market as an advertisement for my goat cheese. it does not sit nicely on the table as pictured, they must have put a rod up it's neck. It is a cute functional puppet, just a little difficult to maneuver."
4,Goat puppet cute but has stiff mouth,"This goat puppet is quality made and overall very nice. The only complaint I have is that the mouth is small and not very mobile. I use this puppet to teach children and, compared to my other Folkmanis puppets, this one takes much more work to use."
4,"&#65533;Pills, thrills and bellyaches&#65533;","A London straight-acting queer and his fag hag work their way around Europe. Along the way they pick up an evil hanger-on, almost kill some woman and become part of the intelligentsia, stopping off for a few drinks and a shag in between. It's funnier than the best lines in the world and sadder than coming down or getting dumped. Govinden has a lethal way with words and on the strength of this, well worth watching. Speed at its most wicked."
2,Porn in writing,"I was expecting more like a novel, this was just a porn book.... I sent this to my girlfriend that was on the edge of being a lesbian/straight/bi and she didn't really appreciate the fact that it was plain out porn."
5,About the Book,"Enables those suffering from this disorder to recognize that sex need not be a furtive enemy to be fought & defeated but, instead, a deeply sensual, passionate, fulfilling & spiritual experience that all human beings are innately entitled to."
4,Good for the price,"During assembly I would use a rubber mallet, not a hammer. If you use a regular hammer you will end up denting the metal and taking some of the finish off. The construction is pretty simple, and could be improved, but for the price it is a really nice work bench. The only reason I docked it 1 star is for the construction quality (slightly lacking), not including screws needed for assembly, and the sometimes difficult to tighten up locking mechanisms (you really have to hit it hard sometimes!)."
5,amazingly sturdy,"being in the airforce my familly and i move alot we needed something sturdy that can be assembled taken apart again and reassembled easily, it has moved with us several times now and is still really sturdy, if we should decide to retire from the military and settle down the we might screw down the boards later on since the holes are there so it is an option, the peg board goes on from the back and is over sized witch is a good thing cuz i crushed one of the corners during its first move so we just adjust where we put it on so it doesn't show"
2,No picture of puzzle in/on box,"We got this puzzle as a gift, and it's been an extremely challenging puzzle, simply because nowhere does an image of the puzzle exist, to aid in completing the puzzle. Not only that, the puzzle is made up of 36 beaches, but the puzzle box only shows 30 of the beaches, and not even in the correct order they are found in the puzzle. Plus, the puzzle itself has a sandy beach border, but even that image is stripped from the box and the literature found inside the puzzle box. So, if you like having an image of the puzzle you are trying to complete, this puzzle set will leave you in frustration. If you like to puzzles completely blind, you'll love the challenge of this puzzle."
1,Thumbs Down!,"We cut open the sealed bag one evening, and we three adults completed the border -- with the exception of ONE MISSING EDGE PIECE. We were sure we would eventually find it. NOT SO! This afternoon we finished the puzzle, and now we discover there are a total of three missing pieces. That is a big disappointment for a lovely puzzle that we probably spent $20 on. If I hadn't cut the plastic bag open myself, I would have thought we were somehow careless, but nobody left the puzzle table until the edge pieces were connected and we found one missing. NOT A GOOD THING!"
5,"THE ""power pop"" album","As far as I'm concerned, the Beat's self-titled debut is the definitive example of late 70's/early 80's power pop, the best album in its genre. Every hook-laden song is so finely crafted that I continue to delight in this album almost 30 years later. If there were any justice in the music world, Paul Collins would be a Grammy Award winner."
1,Poor,"I could not get this product to work at all. The software Nero included with the packaging didn't work because of installation problems with the CD-RW. After days of trying to get past the installation problems, I decided to go to the Nero website and download an updated demo which expired in a few days as I was still troubleshooting the CD-RW. The Nero software included with the burner didn't have an ID number so I couldn't continue using it. All inquiries to I/O magic regarding the Nero ID number were useless. I/O Magic's Tech support did answer about installation issues but nothing worked. What a headache!....Oh yeah, visit I/O magic website and read some of the horror stories posted. It may help you make a better decision."
1,An absolute disappointment!,"I got this laser leveler as a Christmas gift. I was excited to use it; however, when it came to actually trying to get a level line this item missed the mark completely. The directions say for quick leveling aim it where the wall and floor meet (assuming that your floor is level)...once you have it level you must raise the pivot head to where you would like your line. In actuality, when you raise the pivot head your line becomes completely crooked. The levelers are no help. Sure, it has two of them, but as soon as your raise the pivot head one of them is rendered useless leaving the job of leveling a guessing game. I might be mistaken, but I thought that this tool was supposed to take the guessing out of leveling. Don't waste your valuable time with this contraption."
5,Pictorial splendour,"First published in 1979, this large hardcover book covers predominantly American marques and trucking with a bit of Europe, Australia and England thrown in for added measure.Some excellent large glossy pictures, and explanatory text make this 96 page beauty a valuable addition to any truck enthusiast's library."
2,Limited,"This book is not for the novice craftsman. I have some carpentry experience and I did not find it as useful as I had hoped. The lack of step by step methods for creating the door/gate designs was a negative for me. I also did not like the variety of door designs. However, I did find a couple of very interesting designs that I want to tackle as soon as I find a book that will give me sound guidance."
2,so and so,"The author ""gets"" eBay. Unfortunately, he was not granted interviews or access to eBay people. As a result, the book is little more than a collection of articles from the Industry Standard, Fast Company abd the like. Furthermore, the book covers eBay until December 1999 or Q1 2001 at most. Back then, it looked like Yahoo! had a business model, remember? And yes, the author contemplates the possibility of a Yahoo! takeover (which was possible) and even the ridiculous idea that eBay should perhaps create its own ""portal"" in order to grow... Not worth the money. Buy ""The Perfect Store"" by Adam Cohen instead."
2,Only for beginners and suckers,This book has a little bit of useful information for anyone above the beginner level. Very little. The book can be repetitive and the bizarre pictures just distract from the content. And the author is not even a graphic designer! I would think that would be a requirement to write a book of this kind. The author is simply not very qualified to write a book on web design.
4,Important to know:,"It works fine with my eTrex Legend but I'd like to emphasize that the AUTOMOTIVE MOUNTING BRACKET (PART #010-10274-00) is needed in order to use this item, and must be purchased separately."
5,Works Great,I bought a Nuvi 660 and within a few weeks the suction mount stopped working. I think the cold weather makes the rubber suction cup too brittle to hold.When you have $800 invested in a device the last thing you need is to have it falling off the windshield and bouncing to the floorboards!I bought the friction mount and it works like a charm. I drive a mini-cooper and the friction mount stays put even around sharp turns. The only other option out there is to buy a glue mount and attach it to your dash. I have no desire to glue anything to the dash of my car!As other reviewers mentioned this is great for moving from vehicle to vehicle. One warning you will need to buy the Garmin 010-10823-02 Automotive Mount to use this with your Nuvi.
1,It doesn't work with the Garmin 350 Nuvi either!,"Amazon advertised it as working with the Garmin Nuvi series. It doesn't work with all of them....at least not with the 350. While the seller 17th St. Photo, said that they would exchange it for the appropriate one (for an additional $2.50 or so), I am still negotiating with Amazon to get back the $8.50 in extra shipping I had to pay to send back the wrong one. It has been very frustrating and time-consuming trying to make myself understood while speaking to the representative on the phone, and they still don't have it right. Yikes!"
1,BE CAREFUL WHAT YOU BUY!,"THIS ITEM IS NOT FOR THE GARMIN NUVI! ALTHOUGH THE WEBSITE LEADS YOU TO BELIEVE THAT IT'S GOOD FOR ALL GARMINS, THE ONE TO BUY FOR THE NUVI COSTS A MERE $1 MORE, AND INCLUDES THE ACTUAL MOUNT THAT YOU ATTACH THE GPS TO.(entitled Garmin Portable Friction Mount for Garmin Nuvi)THIS ONE IS ONLY THE BEAN BAG; WHAT GOOD IS THAT IF YOU CAN'T ATTACH IT? LOTS OF CONFUSION HERE, EVEN AMONG THE AMAZON CUSTOMER SERVICE FOLKS. (YES, I HAD CALLED!) STILL WAITING TO SEE IF THEY CHARGE ME FOR THE RETURN SHIPPING OR NOT."
1,This does NOT work on a 530 or 550,The 530 and 550 have a round base. This unit has a slot that is oval.
1,Not sold as described,"My problem is with Amazon, not the product, and for the first time, as I purchase from Amazon frequently and always with good results. I bought the ""Garmin Beanbag for Portable Friction Mount for Garmin GPS Units - mount not included"" in January for my son't birthday in March. The description indicates it fits the Garmin nuvi's. I believed it. The March birthday rolls around - too late for a return now - and I discover it does not fit the mount that came with the Garmin nuvi 255W that he has. It may well be a great product, but we will never know and I am out the amount I paid for it."
1,Garmin Portable Friction Mount,"Lies, Lies, Lies! When purchasing said mount on Yahoo the description states this mount can be used with the Garmin Nuvi 350!!!!!!!!! Lies, Lies, Lies!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,GREAT,"D.A. Wolfe below is absolutely incorrect. This thing does not shift at all. I have no idea what he means by he has to ""baby it around corners.""This is a great mount and keeps the unit from sliding in all situations. I do off roading and it still doesn't move. I have a Nuvi 360 and use it in a Tacoma. It truly rocks and is easy to remove and keep in my console with GPS still attached when not in use."
4,Garmin Gravity Mount for StreetPilot 7200,"We were apprehensive that this would just fly off the dash if we turned a corner, but it works great. We move the StreetPilot between my wife's SUV and our RV, and use the Gravity Mount in both locations ... and never have a problem. It's heavy enough to not fly around, and the rubber ""grabber"" base works great. If you're looking for a portable mount to move your Garmin from vehicle to vehicle, this is a good one."
3,You need the beanbag and the mount.,I have a Garmin GPS so have the dashboard mount. Wanted to move the GPS more easily and did not want it on window or stuck to dashboard. Beware! The joystick mount piece that comes with GPS does not fit into the base of the beanbag. It is too big. Order the beanbag with the mount.
2,disapointerd,The product works fine. It did not have the garmin logo on it like it shows in the picture.
3,Serene- sublime- She takes us to a peaceful dimension,"Fully agree with the reviewer who expressed that this sublime cd does not deserve to be in the oblivision it has been consigned to.. I am not much into new age..though I like non strident music, sometimes its just too tranquil for my taste.. but in here we have fairly fast tempos that are melodic, perhaps for background music for reading..The song I found most interesting is ""reasons to Love"" based on Dr. Edwards Lorenz discoeries in the math world of chaos and quoting Niels Bohrs interaction of sub-atomic particles.. an interwoven chant interacts with the scientific quotes with a poem of love.. original.. imagine a love poem hearing a a background also ""Does the flap of a butterfly in Brazil causes a tornado in Texas?"""
4,Reasons To Love,"Reasons To Love is an Awesome arrangement vocally as well as musically. The acapella beginning immediately grabs your attention with it's almost jerky/chopped syncopation. After singing three different segments of song, Robin begins to weave them together into a sound feast. The orchestration is simple yet powerful and mixes with the vocals without taking over them. I was almost moved to tears the first time I heard it."
4,Mission Adequate,"I found the plastic arm to be a bit flexible. And when using the GPS unit (punching buttons) I find that I need to hold the back of the GPS unit to push the ""click stick"". I was thinking of using the ""removable"" adhesive to switch back and forth between two cars, but the adhesive is pretty much one use only. I'm a bit annoyed that if I want the weighted auto base (the friction mount) I have to buy this to get the arm, and then buy the base separetely.It is pretty adjustable and I have found good positions in the two cars I tried, a hatchback and a small SUV (but using the weighted base). Although I am finding that I have to compromise between being able to see the unit and reception (more a fault of the GPS unit IMHO, since a Gecko 201 in the same mount, same postion, has no problems.)"
3,More complicated to use than I thought...,"One thing that wasn't clear to me before I bought this was how the GPS receiver actually attaches to this bracket (though you can see it on the picture if you know what your looking for). To attach it you have to remove the nice rubberized battery cover that came with your receiver with a new hard plastic battery cover that mates to this bracket. My problem is that I also use a garmin belt clip attachment (010-10380-00) and they aren't compatible. So, I have to change the battery cover back and forth depending if I want car mount, or the belt clip. Not very handy for geocaching, where you are in and out of your car and want to clip the GPS onto your belt. It's a shame...with a little better engineering from garmin, they could have designed something universal."
2,Adhesive Problems,"The device is well built but has one major flaw. The adhesive comes in 2 types, ""removable"" and ""permanent"" types. Neither adhesive would stick to the dash of my Jeep Liberty. I'm not sure what I'm going to do with it now, it appears as though I'm going to either have to find a more permanent mounting solution or find another type of adhesive."
2,"Misleading, but well constructed","It seems well built, well designed... one hitch, it states for the etrex, but it doesn't fit the etrex 30. probably my own bad for not researching garmin.com for their part for this device. It's so well built and well priced that I'm going to make it fit... velco fixes everything where duct tape isn't acceptable :)"
2,This book is outdated,"The school of bodybuilding this book teaches is very outdated. Save your money! Don't buy this book. I was following the instructions in this book and I gained thirty pounds...in fat! That's right, it tells you to eat anything. You heard me, ANYTHING. In the old school way, the bodybuilder eats whatever he wants to gain mass and later on sheds off the fat through aerobic exercise. The problem with that is, during the rigorous aerobic training, much muscle mass is also lost with it. The new way of bodybuilding (which makes alot of sense) stresses to eat alot and eat LEAN while you train. It does offer some great exercises but nothing you can't get from other good weight training books."
5,Best Performing USB Web-Cam Ever Made,"Intel Home PC Camera / Model #CS331 / Original Retail was $79.99I have two of these. Intel definitely got it right when they designed this cam, and it's a shame they've discontinued it. This is by far the best USB driven camera I have ever seen. The CCD based (instead of the standard CMOS) optics on this camera are phenomenal, and the video rivals that of my Sony camcorder! Sensitivity & color balance are very good. This cam performs well above average in low light conditions. The video is clear, with no distortion, and does not granulize or pixelate. If you're looking for a top-end USB web cam, try to track one of these down. It will be well worth the effort."
4,Great beginning resource,This book has a very methodical and fun presentation to beginning guitar starting with basic strumming and chords and building from there. Great resource and great songs to learn with.
1,Incomplete Guitar Omnibus,"I'm bringing down the rating average because the music in this book has no proper music notation, AND DOES NOT MAKE THIS CLEAR IN ADVERTISING IT. There are a few little scores with proper notation, but why did the author bother?The book will best serve the serious (and experienced) guitarist by providing him with material (incl. the CD) to practice writing proper music notation for the pieces (that the author should have done), which is what I intend doing after doing ear training.Classical guitarists, stay away from this book unless you intend doing what I've just said I would.__________________________________"
3,"This product is okay, paper is thinner than I expected","I'm not convinced this paper is actually HP paper. It's thinner than I expected and did not come in HP packaging. But, it still serves the purpose and prints nice photos."
4,Printer paper,Pictures are beautiful printed on this paper. I prefer glossy versus matte finish and have been very happy with the results.
2,"The ""Tabs"" Suck","The paper produces beautiful images, but the tabs are difficult to remove. They are scored but the perferations aren't deep enough, so the page tears when you try to remove the tab, even if you score and fold it. Not good.I was wondering why the version with tabs is so much cheaper than the regular non-tab version. Now I know the answer. So do yourself a favor and get the better version, unless you have some kind of use for the tab."
4,good,"very good product, blends very easily into skin, does not feel greeasy at all, very good to wear under sunscreen & makeup ,nice fragrance."
2,Logitech is letting me down..,"The quality of the video is't good at all. I get it at a good price, but with that resolution of video I understand why..Get a better model or try other options."
1,It does not live up to Logitech brand name,I bought this webcam yesterday and its performance is way below expectations. The camera performs pathetically in low light. The pictures were grainy and video capture is equally bad.This camera is not worth its money.
1,Worthless,"The picture quality is dreadful. Impossible to adjust. If you buy it, be sure to save your receipt because you'll quickly return it for a refund."
1,I should have read the reviews first,"I agree with the reviews, this cam stinks. I should have read the reviews before making the purchase."
4,Good book,"A story that brilliantly captures lonliness taken to its utmost extreme.At the same time it's involving, a good read and often funny."
3,Notes on a Scandal,"An easy read, but I didn't enjoy this book as much as I expected to. The characters were annoyingly tedious."
3,Tiered Tale of Love and Obsession,"Imagine the blackest comedy you can, and you'll get the general feel of this novel. At the center of the story is a young teacher's lusty affair with one of her students. But layered with that is the narrator, (a fellow teacher, spinster, and friend of the accused) who in relaying the events, reveals her own version of obsession and love. I have to admit I found myself laughing out loud at times at Barbara's self involved observations. Yet as the book progressed, I found myself increasingly uncomfortable with all of the players and their actions, and by the end felt an overwhelming need to shower it all off."
4,This Novel Takes the Reader Into the Dark Places of the Soul,"This is a well-written novel about a high school teacher who has an affair with one of her male students. There is an older female teacher who courts her as a friend and in the course of the friendship, the affair is revealed.This novel takes a lot of twists and turns through the dark places of the human soul. To say much more about the book would be to give away too much. Suffice it to say, it is about the characters of these two women, their relationship, and the painful lessons that one learns through life experience.I recommend this book for a good read as long as you're not depressed when you start it."
3,Good but not Great,"This book was good and the story moved along and gave insight into a relationship most of us don't understand. But, it wasn't great for me. I didn't have any sympathy for the teacher and I just thought the character it's narrated by was weird and had few social skills and was obsesive with friends. She is not someone I could relate to. It is a quick interesting read but not something I was looking forward to each day."
3,Good for Movie/TV fans,"I bought the game and like it, but you do need the book for correct answer....I thought I knew Kevin Bacon info, but after playing the game with friends I bought the book...It is a good way for people to get together and test their knowledge of the 1980s and now 1990s star....."
3,This is a frame work for doing statistics in Business,This is a book for one who are using to formulate business decision and how to assess data gathering for business purposes.
2,Eh...,"A quick read by Nora Roberts.The beginning of the book starts off with Raven coming into contact with an old love - Brand. (Stupid name, I much preferred it when they used Brandon instead, personal problem of mine!) The plot gets you all set to hate Brand for leaving Raven in the past. You wish that she would stay away from him for this very reason. But that's not what happens. All thoughout the book during their arguements Brand is very aggresive with her...grabbing her wrists, her throat, etc! But she just brushes it off or else blames his physical agression on herself! What kind of message does this send?I don't know, I just couldn't get into this book. I didn't like the plot or the characters. :("
4,Reliable Battery,"I needed a second backup battery for my JVC GZ-HD7 system. Pretty quick charge via the camera AC adapter, holds the charge when dormant for a long time and reliable when recording. It does not get anywhere near the advertised recording time of 2.5 hours. It gets about one hour with LCD display and about 10 minutes more using the view finder. I seldom use the view finder unless the lighting is not good. Having two batteries is a good deal though. I'd buy the JVC AC charger but the price is outrageously priced."
4,VF815 battery works as it's supposed to,"I bought this battery for my JVC GZ-MG335. It does what it is supposed to do. The battery lasts about 2.5 hours. It is definitely larger in size than the battery that comes with the camera (VF808). I would not want any bigger of a battery on this tiny camcorder, so I am glad I didn't buy the VF823. I would suggest the VF815 for longer recording times."
3,"Very Good data, but poor presentation","The book is full of valuable information. But Al Ries does not know how to use facilitators to reading. Such as the use of short paragraphs, sections in each chanpter, short chapters etc. The books written by the duo (Ries and Trout) where much better.The team was very good. It brought us The 22 immutable laws, Positioning, marketing Warfare etc..., But alone I think Ries lacks flare and and trout lacks substance.Get back together and show us more of the Old stuff."
4,"Good, basic advise","The basic points are driven home repeatedly, but they make for good advice. I am glad I ran across this book as it has had a positive impact on my 7 year old export business. Also, I have spoken with a number of people in their late 50s who were career corporate types. Many of them were forced out or retired early and are very cynical about corporate America. This book could serve as a handbook for understanding these people's grief as legions of managers who were hired in the 60s were let go by companies who obviously did not head this book's message."
1,Fly Away MC,"You have to be into MC's to like this one. Personally I think MC's degrade the essence of any original electronica track through their voicing over of senseless lyrics that end up white-washing the actual music.In addition to bad lyrics, why does the MC feel it necessary to remind the crowd/listener that they are the ""Freestylers!"". At least every 5 minutes by my count. Pretty cheesy.1/5 stars for this dismal album."
4,steppenwolf=steppenstrange,"Steppenwolf, by Hermann Hesse, is a captivating, but sometimes confusing novel. It deals with the inner conflicts of Harry Haller and his split personality, the Steppenwolf.The preface is long and drawn out, but take your time and carefully read it. You will find that it is extremely important to the development of the book. After you finish the arduous task of completing the first 25 pages, you get to take a stroll in the life of the Steppenwolf. It is a distorted look on the ""bourgeois society"" that Harry lives in, a post war Germany. Haller deals with ex-girlfriends, gramophones, Mozart, and a Magical Theatre that is for Madmen only. The end of the book is worth its weight in pages. If you're not a mad man by the time you get there, you will be when you're finished.I was extremely satisfied when I completed this novel. It was hard to get through at times, but well worth getting through. Everyone that can handle a little self-analysis should definitely read Steppenwolf."
4,Almost perfect.,"Theres nothing much to say, its a good product, just wish it was a little smaller given that i got it paperback to carry it inside the jacket pockets, half an inch smaller would have been good, even if it still fits its troublesome and a little annoying that you have to struggle to tuck it in. Still the rest is pretty good and the cover picture is nice."
3,complexity at its finest,"This book was a philosophical rollercoaster, if you liked Siddartha alot as i did then maybe this book isnt for you. Steppenwolf is definitly a step up on the complexity compared to Siddartha. Where as Siddartha had glimpses of philosophical insight, steppenwolf fully consisted of just that. If you are ready for a challenge then i would recommend that you dive in. I personally found myself gettin dizzy and lost in all the run-one sentences."
2,"Has its moments, ultimately kind of a mess though","Much as I appreciate Hesse's cool tone and admire his ability to get to the root of so much internal emotional conflict with such honesty and sincerity, I thought Steppenwolf was kind of a mess. I felt like I had a measure of compassion for the characters in Demian and Siddartha, but Harry Haller's issues really just struck me as a needlessly melodramatic pity party, and this wasn't helped by the weird mystic/hallucinatory cabaret and imaginary conversations with Goethe and Mozart that Hesse sets him in. There are plenty of wonderful passages with smart observations about what it feels like to be at war within yourself, but there are just too many odd, unresolved images and scenes that in the end didn't seem to add up to much."
5,A Nietzschean Novel,"Coming from a philosophy background, with a predominant interest in Nietzsche, I find it hard to ignore the numerous aspects of Nietzsche in ""Steppenwolf"". Viewing the self as a multiplicity, favoring humor over seriousness, recognition of life's suffering while striving to overcome it, anti-nationalism-- are all major themes of Nietzsche and each of these views is voiced in the novel. As every true pupil of Nietzsche's is instructed Hesse takes Nietzschean themes as a ground and develops them in his own way and without any strict adherence to Nietzsche's philosophy. As a novel of ideas Hesse's Steppenwolf demonstrates a philosophy of life that cannot be captured within the confines of a stereotypical philosophical treatise. This novel is a breath of fresh air for anyone searching for meaning or anyone who is not content to be told how to feel or what to believe. This is the first Herman Hesse novel I have read and will surely not be the last."
3,Generally Not Needed,"An external antenna for a GPS is generally not needed unless (1) You have coated windshield tinting - these have metal particles that can obstruct satellite reception. (2) You are constantly in an area surrounded by skyscrapers - these can interfere with satellite reception also. If you are not affected by these two conditions, then you DO NOT need an external antenna... using an external antenna will NOT improve your satellite reception... you ONLY need this if you are having reception problems. If you are not having reception problems, you are wasting your money... it is an external antenna, and NOT a signal amplifier... if you are not having reception problems, you will NOT get any better signals using an external antenna."
5,Great Series,"I purchased season 1 and 2 as soon as they were available. So, I can't wait for season 3 to come out on DVD.Every episode in season 3 has presented some new information or has brought to light some additional facts.My favorite episode in season 3 is ""Aliens and the Undead"" which explored atrocities and deadly rituals and their possible connection to aliens."
5,Love this show,"Excellent show! I'm not saying it's Aliens but it has to be Aliens! Giorgio is my favorite part of the whole series, plus I like that you get a different view on subjects other than what mainstream scientists believe."
3,Good...But not as good as Seasons 1 and 2,"Some of the information presented didn't seem to connect as strongly to the main themes of each of the shows. It was almost like they simply used much of what they had in seasons 1 and 2 and sort of re-purposed some of the material...not all of it, just some of it."
4,Ancient Aliens,"Im a fan of the idea of aliens. They never really prove anything in this series but they do come up with some good theories. I just wish someone would either prove or disprove alien visitation, maybe one day."
2,Not so good,"This item will not charge my 4g Ipod. When I plug it in, it will at first start charging and then my Ipod will give me a warning message. I figured at first maybe the battery was low, but after trying with 5 new batteries and still getting nowhere, I gave up. Great idea just doesn't work on my 4g."
3,"Pretty Good, but not Great","I Really liked the author and could identify with her, but she never really said how she got so much energy all of a sudden and what made her stop her obsession with food. She seems to just keep repeating that she has all this energy, but from where did it come from all of a sudden."
2,Shocked.,It lacks suspense and tension. The plot and premise are predictable. Some movies are like books: the cover is better than the contents. I wish I had bought Paranormal Activity II with the money I wasted on this turkey.
1,not happy,The Wireless Projection Forecaster was expensive but I was willing to overlook that. We only used it for 3 wks. before the humidity and inside temp. stopped working. I am not happy because that gives me one more thing to do that I do not have time for. I plan to call the day time phone number of the company since there is a 1 yr. warranty. My husband is an instrument tech. with yrs. of experience and it is not our misunderstanding of how the equipment should work.
4,Don't teach kids to wack moles!,Sure it's fun but will you be sending the wrong message to an impressionable child? Would you buy this game if it were little people they were wacking? How about dogs or cats? Teach compassion for all creatures and buy a punching bag instead.
4,Fun to play not very durable,"This is a very fun game for the kids, but with the way kids ""whac"" the mole, it should be a little more durable. I have already had to take the component apart so that the sound will work again, after only playing for about 10 min."
3,Not as Good as the PHB and Source Book,"This book is somewhat of a let down compared to the Player's Handbook, and the Freedom City Source Book.Many of the villian concepts are strained, while the artwork is inconsistant, with multiple artists and styles.It lacks the consistency, development, and ingenuity of the characters in the previous two books.Dr. Dungeon and Murder Boy are two examples of characters that pale in comparison to say the Atomic Brain, and Gepeto.There are more plenty more that just aren't there, too.It is not the same level as the other two books.In retrospect, I would pay 10 bucks for it, but not the 20 plus shipping that I paid."
4,Great Buy!!,I love this little MP3 player. It was all that I was looking for in an MP3 player and it was inexpensive compared to other players like it. It has nice features and design. The battery life is great and only needs one AAA. The only downside is that I'm afriad it might break the first time I drop it. It just doesn't feel very durable.
1,Coby MP3 Player # MP-C641,"I was pleased with the appearance of the player and how easy it was to load songs. But AFTER 20 MINUTES OF USE, IT BROKE. After pushing in the menu button to make a different selection, the button stuck in and wouldn't come out. The music stopped and a weird noise came thru the head phones. I WOULD NOT RECCOMEND THIS PRODUCT !!!"
1,Caused More Harm Than Good,"This protein treatment caused more breakage in areas that had issues, and strengthened already healthy parts of my hair. I did not need more strength added to already healthy areas, I needed the more brittle areas to be more stable. My hair is fine but thick and can get damage easily. I have to color it every 3-6 months with a natural hair product (Naturtint) because it gets damaged easily. I had heard that this works best for black hair, however I was told it's also great if you are white, but it doesn't seem the case after reading other reviews with similar problems. I have used Nexxus in the past as well as Joco and both helped add more stability to my hair, but after using this two-step treatment exactly as the instructions read, my hair has more split ends and breakage than ever before. I will definitely not be using it again and I do not recommend it to other people with similar hair to mine."
3,aphogee,APHOGEE IS A GOOD PRODUCT BUT IT IS NOT GREAT. I LIKE TO CONSIDER THIS A LOW PROTEIN FORMULA. I BELIEVE THIS PRODUCT IS A LITTLE BIT EXPENSIVE FOR A LOW PROTEIN PRODUCT WHEN THERE IS HAIR MAYONAISE THAT WORKS VERY WELL AND IS ONLY 10 BUCKS IN YOUR LOCAL WALMART. IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A PRODUCT TO STOP BREAKAGE FROM HAIR BEING WEAK FROM RELAXERS THAN MIZANI KERAFUSE SHOULD BE YOUR CHOICE. ALWAYS MIX IT WITH HYDRAFUSE AND DEPENDING ON THE EXTENT OF YOUR HAIR YOU CAN ALWAYS MIX MORE OR LESS KERAFUSE WITH HYDRAFUSE TO MAKE A LOW PROTEIN CONDITIONER. I HOPE Y REVIEW HAS BEEN HELPFUL.
3,"Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't?","I dunno, between this and the two minute reconstructor, I'd have to say that the reconstructor does a better job of strengthening my hair. I don't know if I'm doing something wrong, but I've done this protein treatment twice so far (once every six weeks) and it only strengthens my hair for 24-48 hours and then my hair starts breaking again. The reconstructor on the other hand lasts me for a week, which is good because I do a protein deep conditioner once a week along with a moisturizing conditioner twice a week. I do plan on finishing this up, but after that I'm probably going to try something from Nexxus or Aubrey Organics... their products seems to give me good results, so here's hoping their protein products work wonders."
2,Plug Problems,"Like an earlier reviewer noted the plug on mine came apart, which had to be replaced by HP. The design of the plug is faulty. Besides the problems with the plug the unit works as advertised."
2,"Elegant design and functional, when it worked.","I recently purchased this palm for my mother who was interested in getting a new PDA. While the device itself worked perfectly, there was one major problem we seemed to have with it. The device itself seemed to stop turning on after a while. We had purchased the store's extended warranty so we just took it back and they replaced it. Second one, the same thing happened again. So we tried fiddling around with the battery, apparently the battery easily loses it's connection so the unit itself will not power on unless you fiddle with the battery. Two PDA's in a row with the same exact problem, and another reviewer encountered something similar, I think it's fair to say the initial release batch of this PDA has definitely had some issues. We ended up exchanging it for a Palm TX.My mother said she loved it while it worked, and is very disappointed such a trivial problem can cause so much annoyance."
3,RAM memory low,"Everythings works perfectly and I really recomend this item if you are not planning on watching videos or opening more than one program at a time. the ram memory is low, so when you open the calendar or email, it takes time... just like an overloaded pc takes time to run."
1,HP IPAC RX 1955,"The soft ware has problems with memory cardsPrograms stallThe screen will not stay alignedThe firmware needed to be updated twice and still does not workThe Main board was replaced and the unit still stalls, does not close applications and the screen losses alignment.The only GOOD thing I can stay about it is the Technical service provided by HP has been excellant.Lets see if they will take it back - because I have lost my patience with it."
2,"Works, but not worth the price",Honestly it feels more like a regular (albiet thin) piece of paper to me.Drugstore brands work just as well for so much less....
4,NIV APPLICATION COMMENTARY...,"I have a paper this semester, and needed a commentary for Ephesians. I purchased this book on the reviews, and the recommendation of my class instructor. I wasn't disappointed one bit, enjoyed what I have read. which is very little, but look forward to using is some more. I would recommend this book for anyone. very easy to read."
4,cooling bandanas,"These are great! It is a shame that they only cover your neck, but if you use them all you can wrap them around your wrists or ankles also. They are very cool, especially when kept in the fridge! I definately recommend them if you are outside in the summer."
2,okay,"i work in a warehouse for 10 or 12 hr. shifts. the temp. can reach excess of 90 during the summer. we do have people who faint. this bandana does stay puffed & damp, but not cold. (which for some reason i thought it would). im not impressed. if i get lucky enough to get in front of a fan, then it gets ""cool"". its better than nothing, but i would look for other products."
1,Beware,"The Lou Gehrig Story listed on the cover of this DVD is NOT the version contained on the disc. It's supposed to be the 1978 Made for TV film starring Edward Herrmann and Blythe Danner. However, the program contained is the 1953 ""Lou Gehrig Story"" that appears to have been a live television broadcast. Both programs on this disc are very, very low quality and difficult to watch due to the grainy, blurry picture and poor sound quality. Avoid this DVD in the dollar bin at your local discount store! My copy is going into the trash bin!"
4,GOOD READ,"The book is good. Too much detail in some areas, but overall good read for someone interested in Lewis an his life."
1,OFFENSIVE ODOR!,"I ordered two of this item and cannot use either of them. They may have been packed in mothballs or some chemical dripped into them. Even after discarding the packaging, the cables smell so offensively that the odor can be detected all over the house. DO NOT BUY if you are sensitive to chemicals!"
1,Not Good = Do not buy!,"I bought this laptop lock a little over a month ago and it completely fell apart today. I was at a coffee shop with my new laptop and wanted to keep my computer secure and after I locked it a small pin fell out. When I went remove the lock another pin fell out and the the entire lock just broke apart and I had to throw it out. Spend more money on better products, it is horrible"
1,junk,"I am very disappointed, I bought two of this locks, for me and other to give to a friend, less than 60 days of usage they just broke the lock, started to fall apart!So think twice before this ""deal""!!!!"
4,GOOD COMP...,"MIXED OUT BUT A MUST FOR AVID COLLECTORS OF FREDDY.UK EP REALESES ARE ALL HERE,EARLY STUFF INCLUDED PALASADES PARK..AS ALWAYS BIO IS FINELY DETAILED AND PICTURES OF EPS ARE THIER,BUY THIS ONE AS MOST OF THE SEE FOR MILES STUFF GOES OUT OF PRINT."
1,Just say NO to activation,I was just about to buy the software when I read the reviews and the fact that adobe has started using an activation scheme where your limited to one pc per install. Well I use my laptop as well to edit files with photoshop and what happens if your hard drive crashes? Do you have to beg for another install. I think it's time to just say NO to any product with activation.
1,What A Waste of Money,"This disc is a total rip-off. Had I known there was no music, I would NOT have bought it. The fact that it does not contain any music should be stated upfront in bold type and not hidden in the small print. DO NOT BUY, save your money."
2,Unarmed Combatives 6,"Hello! This is Hock. This old video was part of a old training set. Without the other fundamentals, it is not worth much at all. Instead? I would search on my name, W. Hock Hochheim on the internet and see all the new, vastly improved material, in training order and on DVD! That is where I would spend my money. This whole subject has been reshot, redone and is so much better on DVD and much cheaper too! Given the new DVD, I wouldn't waste my time with this old video at all."
3,See the new title,"This book has been re-issued as Confessions of An Enron Executive: A Whistleblower's Story. The new version is essentially the old version, perhaps with a few minor corrections."
1,"Installed, but never worked","I purchased Europa Universalis III because I was a big fan of its predecessors. I already own EU I & II. Unfortunately, after repeated installation attempts, not once did I ever get it to actually play. NOT ONCE! In desperation, I downloaded the ""Heir to the Throne"" demo to see if that might help jumpstart things; no success. Fortunately, I still have the older versions, both of which work just fine. I rate the older versions of EU highly; too bad I couldn't give the AI a run for its overseas trade on this one."
3,Where is the history?,"This loaded reasonably well and I don't care about the graphics or music, so I don't have anything to say about its presentation. (EU2 had nice medieval music though). However, gameplay is markedly different. I loved EU2 for the history--playing as Castile you can expect the formation of Spain, the Reconquista, Charles V controlling the Netherlands and Austria (half the fun was suppressing the Protestant Dutch revolts). This is all gone--now I'll never see myself as the Holy Roman Emperor (because Austria wouldn't even be my ally). Being a pacifist, I haven't conquered Grenada yet. I own half of North America but my neighboring Aragon wouldn't be my vassal. Fantasy is good but not as fun as ""real"" history.Why play this (without the expected historical ups and downs) instead of Civ 4?"
4,Nice Start,"I love Tyra Banks and what she brings to the plate as a model, producer, and overall class act. At first, I didn't even wanna give this show a chance, cause models wasn't my thing. Mainly, since you heard all the negativity about them. But they are real just like everyone else; whether their skinny, big, tall, medium height, they are who they are. I'm glad Adrienne won this first cycle, cause she the only one that was willing to go that extra mile. Plus she was such a fun girl!"
3,It's ok,"This is an ok book. For someone who isnt in the Noise Control field and just a student or in training, this book can be hard to understand. Because of this, i didnt find it too helpful for school."
4,Ira Davies what a voice Icehouse what a band,On MTV I saw Icehouse live in New York and was highly Impressed. My Wife had Man of Colours and I bought Great Southern Land the best of album then I bought the meltdown from Amazon.com. The Amazon service was prompt and all of the cd and dvd cases were intact. Way to go Amazon.com a job well done. The meltdown holds up well on repeated listening. Lay Your Hands on me I would like to hear in a dance club sometime. Ira Davies is the Australian David Bowie and sounds great singing Heroes. Electric Blue is a police emergency code where I am for an all cars response. Its nice that there is a response for deep blue heroes of Law Enforcement
3,North Star,"I enjoyed the setting of this movie, a frozen Alaskan wilderness and gold mining boom town making a unique backdrop for a western. The scenery was excellent but I thought the plot and writting left a lot to be desired, Lambert and Haan have been better, but as I've said the writting was not too good and they didn't have much to work with, definately not either mans best."
1,Trash,"A very disappointing offering full of romantic cliches and untruths. Since when does a woman need an adulterous affair to be complete? Since when does living in the ""here and now"" not lead to consequences to pay later? Hmm...perhaps if an earthquake strikes and places the ""heroine"" in danger..."
2,"Dumb ending, trashy love story","I've enjoyed a number of other books by Siddons, but found myself very disappointed by Fault Lines. The book started out great but slowly moved downhill to a dismal ending. It read like Siddons was placed on a tight deadline to finish the book and was forced to whip out anything in order to meet the deadline. The ending was predictable and just plain dumb. The so-called ""love story"" was trashy and read like a cheap grocery store romance novel. Yuck. I haven't been able to pick up another one of her books since."
3,A Fair Movie,"A fair movie,was a sleeper hit. Great cast but I found the movie actually quite boring throughout the first half. The movie gets better as it goes along. It follows the basic plot of good guys v.s. bad guys, and one clan v.s. another clan. The main star is a young man whose father was killed and who was almost killed himself by the same evil clan."
3,Ghost face killer rematch,This movie could have been better with the cast they have. Look for Bolo In dreadlocks. Best part about this movie is the opening theme song & the final fight rematch between Ghostface Killer & Jack Long (Chess boxing)
5,Great DVD,Mr. Spikes DVD was great! I was amazed at the amount of information crammed into this DVD. It offers a little something about ever aspect of Kayak fishing.
2,Disappointing,"The style, plot, and character development were all so weak that I was not able to willingly suspend my disbelief. I confess that I skimmed through the middle chapters because I could not stomach a closer reading. The writing is cliched and self-conscious. The plot and characters are unrealistic. I find it hard to understand why there were several favorable ratings on Amazon before I bought the book and apparently the author has received several awards. This is the first book in a series, and perhaps the writing improves. However, I don't intend to spend any money to find out."
1,Defective product!,"First set of DVD's were defective. Returned, received another set that was also defective. I will never purchase from this person again and advise you not to either."
4,Inspiring and fun,"It was years ago that I first watched Season One and have come back to it with nostalgic feeling and a fresh addiction. Love love love the original team of High Voltage, especially Hannah well known as a colourist and a great talent for pin ups, it has become one of my favourite series. Highly recommend for those new to tattoos and even for those, like me, who are avid tattoo collectors."
3,Why the Patriots are no longer the Patsies,"Michael Holley's quick-read book deals mainly with the modern era of the New England Patriots that have become the so-called ""model franchise"" of the NFL. Despite a first book-flawed style, Holley captures the impact Coach Bill Belichick had on this team whose past was mostly the object of ridicule and characterized by ineptitude. A must-read for Pats fans. As for fans of other NFL teams that have't had the taste of a Super Bowl win recently, or never, this book offers a glimmer of hope that with the right ingredients and a bit of luck they too can have a championship."
1,Abusive to the very core!,"This book teaches parents to be abusive towards their children, setting them up for countless struggles later in life, up through and including suicide, rebellion, anti-""christian"" sentiment, etc. It teaches parents to break a child's spirit and will as early as possible. It does not respect the child for who they are, who God created them to be, and for them to fulfill their God given destiny (Psalm 139). This sets them up to despise authority and eventually cut them off from God. Take a further look at the blight of this type of upbringing from an open apology from the worldwide church of ""god"" about the countless people who were abused by their upbringing in this cult: [...] and if you want a free copy of this piece of trash google it. you can find one. don't waste your money on contributing to this horrible book.The Plain Truth about Child RearingTHE PLAIN TRUTH ABOUT CHILD REARINGThe Plain Truth About Child Rearing"
1,Total waste of time!,"I don't get why other guys gave 5 stars to this it's not giving enough information.The chapter go like this:chapter 1 : Is only talking about the author and what he thinks of the bookchapter 2 :It talks about Very Very Very basic stuff of animationI don't want to bother myself by writing more about this bookit's just a waste of time unless you don't know what is flash!It's 32.99$ l wouldn't buy it even for 5.00$ I recommend to everyone to buy ""Animating Flash characters"" it's cheaper and better.The guys who rated this item with 5 stars are surely the author or his frieds, or maybe they didn't even see what's on the bookAnyway l made the mistake of buying it and l am writing this so you won't do the same mistake as l did."
2,This book is not for beginners!,"I bought this book thinking it was for beginners but it's not. This is what I'd call an advanced flash cartooning book. I was frustrated with some of the examples in the book. I didn't like how the author did his walk cycle. The walk cycle was too complicated for me. I tried several times to read the book with an open mind but that didn't help. I also didn't like the fact that their animatic wasn't created using flash but with quicktime. I did enjoy their flash cartoon ""Jicketts Speed Shop Episode 1"". Go check out jicketts.com/pilot/index.htmlThe best flash cartooning book I've come across for beginners is ""Flash 5 Cartooning"" by Mark Clarkson. I'd recommend ""Flash 5 Cartooning"" instead of this book."
4,Wow!,"I bought a used one for $8 bucks and I saw a new one for only $18. Thats a good deal for a dvd that is pretty good. The characters are good, but the story is something that everyone has heard of, but that shouldn't stop anyone from trying this show. Animation wise is alright, not the best, but I seen worst. Its a good show for the price, also its kinda like Blue gender.If you like sci-fi, you should try this out."
3,IT AINT BAD BUT IT AINT TIGHT...........,"ITS O.K. COULD BE BETTER, BUT I HAVE TO ADMIT THAT THE SONG WITH WYCLEF IS OFF THE HOOK. ITA S HALF AND HALF ALBUM. HALF GOOD, HALF A-IGHT. LISTEN FOR YOURSELF. PEACE OUT AND MUCH LOVE."
4,GOOD TIMES!!!!!!!!,I was very pleased with this box set. And the price was a steal for 133 episodes. Unfortunately I realized I liked GOOD TIMES more as a child than I do as an adult. I also realized that the producers made a grave mistake when they did away with the James Evans character. John Amos was fantastic as the patriarch of the household.
4,Good Times are back !!,"I remember this show from my pre-teen years..i loved it then, and love it now.The audio and picture quality of this DVD collection are fairly good, so only a fussy audiophile might find something to complain about. Otherwise, you'll love re-living those great episodes from the 70's :)"
3,"Good CISSP review, but not made to be a primary study guide","A recent review of this book in a major security magazine piqued my interest, as the reviewer basically said that Mandy Andress is a plagiarist in writing CISSP Exam Cram. I didn&#65533;t find that to be the case; even though Andress could have done a better job with references.Overall, Richard Bejtlich&#65533;s review is pretty accurate. The book is basically Cliff Notes for the exam. If you have done a lot of reading preparing for the CISSP Exam, this book will serve you well. It is a quick and dirty reference that is to the point. It is perfect to take on a bus or plane to review as it does not weigh nearly 10 pounds like the CISSP All-in-One Exam Guide.If you want breadth, this book is fine.If you want depth, then don&#65533;t use an Exam Cram title.For those that want hearty references for the exam and wanting exhaustive tomes, they would be better served with books such as:CISSP All-in-One Exam Guide..."
5,Self help,Dr. Laura is awesome and funny while getting to the real root of problems at the same time. I high recommend her.
1,Let she who is without sin cast the first stone......,"Oh Please! Enough with this self-appointed moral arbiter, already! Just when I begin to think that P.T. Barnum was wrong, along comes a dreck-dealer like Dr. Laura to prove P.T. right.This woman wants only YOUR MONEY. Her venom and hate are contributing to the ""downfall of America,"" not the behaviors she condemns.If you're looking for moral answers, try asking your minister, priest, rabbi, or other pastoral counselor for help. Try actually reading the Bible, Torah, Koran, or the sacred literature of your choice. Follow the Golden Rule. And think for yourself.I would give this book ZERO stars if that were a choice....."
1,THIS BOOK IS WORTH MINUS STARS--IT JUST WASN'T AN OPTION,"I find this woman's attitude and sharp tongue totally disgusting. Why would anyone listen to anything she has to say when her own character seems to me to be in question. She is sarcastic, cruel, and seems to enjoy demeaning others--not my idea of a role model or someone who's advice I want to take. Save your money. Save your time. By the way, SHE ISN'T A PSYCHOLOGIST! Isn't it obvious that she has no credentials that equip her to be advising others on their behavior and relationships. You have all been duped!"
2,Some good points...but...,"Schlessinger uses many examples from her audiences through the years to give advice in her book. Although there are some good points to the book--determining consequences before taking action, doing the right thing and taking responsibility for one's actions--it is weakened dramatically by the books limited focus, the author's self-righteous attitude and a prescribed set of rigid behaviors.The Re-Discovery of Common Sense: A Guide to: The Lost Art of Critical Thinking"
2,Laura talks better than she writes,"...The best parts of this book are the the transcripts from the radio show. Why? Because when Dr. Schlessinger is behind the mike, she's focussed, clear, chatty, and intriguing. But her writing hits the page with a thud. There's simply no life in it.Her topic is an interesting one, but this book does not succeed in making its point. I would be hard-put to find a reader who enjoyed the book who didn't already listen her show AND was a rabid fan. I'm not discussing whether or not I agree with her position, but how she communicated it.I suspect that she's trying to write a book that has already been written, and she fails in comparison. Spend your money on M. Scott Peck's _People of the Lie_ instead, and listen to the Dr. Laura radio show for the same information. There really isn't anything in the book that she hasn't covered in the show.I read her first book as well and was also disappointed in how poorly the writing compares to her on-air style."
3,Not Worth the Hype,"Dr. Laura Schlessinger has a huge following as a talk-show host. Her audience eagerly awaits her books. But I feel she's a better speaker than a writer.The book, while it has the supporting anecdotes and vignettes to make her point, doesn't intrigue me. And I wanted to be intrigued; after all, her show can be gripping.With the loss of word emphasis, tone, accent, and all the other cues we hear on the radio, what the book leaves is a flat transcript feel.Schlessinger's job as a writer is to bring the emotion back into her subject. I don't feel she succeeded. You can get the same lessons from listening to her show for a week or two, and that won't cost you a penny."
2,THREE C'S BUT NO A,"Don't get me wrong. I do believe in the attributes of character, courage and conscience, but in this book, the words seem to carry self-righteous overtones of ""The Lord helps those who help themselves"" or ""I am a self-made man (or woman).""In this day and age, it is almost as if levels of character, courage and conscience are espoused as the only primary measuring rods of each individual's worth. I will grant that they are essential, but what ever happened to faith, hope, and charity?"
1,didn't say anything new,"Dr. Laura seems to have forgotten been there, done that. She has no tolerance and I construe some of her behaviour as hateful and small minded."
5,"Incredible music, ahead of its time...","If you are a country-rock music fan then you are sure to love this album. I grew up listening to this album with my parents and have loved it ever since. As a matter of fact, I love all the albums put out by this duo. Their harmony is second to none and the quality of their songs could easily compete with today's top groups. The version of ""What's Forever For"" is beautifully performed and is far better than the version recorded by Michael Martin Murphy. I am very excited that this album has been released on CD. For those of you who are fans of Dan Seals, this album is a must."
4,tasty rice,"The rice cooker arrived on time, and worked great right out of the box.The rice was very tasty (much better than with our old 10 year old cooker)."
2,Regard these stars as minus ones,"I was trying to avoid another bad HP product. This one seemed ok for a few weeks, however:1. It is huge and heavy.2. It was very difficult to set up.3. It is very difficult to clean, after a few months there was the inevitable paper jam, and it proved impossible to clean up without disassembly, i.e. you need either a professional or professional tools and probably both.I recommend this product if you want a very large and heavy paper weight."
3,Good Tales to have.,It was difficult to understand their English. At times it was little too slow. I think they are wonderful tales thatshould not be forgotten. I story-tell them to my grandchildren and maybe when they are older they can understandthe movie. I am glad I bougth them
4,Star Happy Quilts,"As a quilting instructor, I found this book a delightful assortment of color combinations that sometimes students overlook. However, I thought the cutting instructions were somewhat confusing and didn't like her method of cutting triangles for the blocks when half-square triangles would have worked better and are easier to handle. I also thought the price was too high for a book that basically only had one pattern. On the plus side, it does show an interesting variation on settings and would work well for an intermediate project if started with an instructor.Greta Stewart, Lincoln, NE."
3,Scarf Review,"The product was nice. The color didnt seem like it was truly black. The tags on the product were a pain, so I cut them off but other than that everything was okay."
2,only for fans,this album is a very good job by manolis lidakis. but i'd only reccomended it for those that know lidakis and love his music. most of the songs are slow rythm.
5,Pop-dance of the highest order,"This is a great tune both on the radio and in the best, sweatiest clubs. With a disco-style melody and sweet lyrics it is the business, great fun and genuinely touching. This carries a vibe and flow all the way through, and no party should be without it. I hope Modjo don't become another one-hit wonder as more tunes like this would be great."
5,I've met Bob Evans and you can believe his story.,"I spent two days with Bob Evans in Wash., D.C., promoting his movie ""Black Sunday"" and found him to be honest & straightforward, a class act. No phoniness, no ego stroking like a lot of movie types I dealt with. His book, also, is not just another Hollywood hype whitewash, but an honest recounting of the facts--pretty and ugly--as he remembers them. Read it! A helluva story; a helluva life; a helluva guy!"
4,Great!,"Got this for my younger sister who aspires to be a Veterinarian. She absolutely loves it! She loves using it on our pets and seeing what she can hear. Parts are a little delicate. I'm not sure how it actually would work in a real medical setting, but we can always hear heartbeats, breathing sounds very clearly."
5,GREAT MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I came across this movie a couple of years ago and I thought it was great and lots of laughs This is a movie worth watching again and again and again. Its just a fun movie to watch. If you want a fun movie to watch this is it.
2,Rather small,"While the quality is fine, the overall size is much smaller than I expected making it unstable for a camera with any size or weight. Don't recall if measurements were included in description."
3,Despite organizational flaws...a benefit for the classroom!,"Clearly the segregational approach is difficult to follow and at times puzzling. However, as a teacher of American History for 10th graders I have found the 12-15 minute biographies on each of the presidents very valuable. They are great supplemental sources. I could never show a 50 minute or 90 minute video on a president, but with this series I can address 2 or 3 within the 85 minute block that the course is taught. My students seemed engaged and because of the short snipet of time, the basic underpinnings of the presidents and their accomplishments stays pretty well focused. Without this my students would have been denied some good background on presidents such as McKinley, Taft, Hoover and Coolidge. Reorganization into a timeline of presidents would have made it a super source."
2,Frustrating,"The objects are not equal sided, so it is a bit advanced for the age it is suppose to target. It seems some kids could become frustrated with trying to place each objest in it's correct spot, being an adult has to apply some skill!"
1,Only based on the samples posted,Samples sound great if and only if you like coughing and chair creaking.
5,Buddy still rocks!,"A blast from my past! (Actually from my dad's past, since the copy I read as a little girl was from his childhood). I loved rereading this book 40 some years after I last read it. Okay ... so it's a little goody goody for the current time, but it features a lovable character, a childhood we can all feel nostalgic about, and a plot that moves along. I realize it was written for children, but I enjoyed it nevertheless."
1,Big Waste of Money,"Just about every recipe in this book is only good for 1 to 2 days and, needs to be stored in the refrigerator. Unless you are taking a shower/bath, washing your face and hair several times a day you would be throwing out most of these recipes out. Just not worth the time or money involved. I wanted something that I can make and store for at least a month or two, and not in the refrigerator!!!Some of the ingredients are not easy to find, Panama wood bark, walnut husk, horsetail stalks, and Iceland Moss, just to name a few.There are hundreds of very good, FREE recipes on the internet. Do not waste your money on this book. Espically if you are looking for something you can give as gifts or resale."
5,The Best Book I've Ever Read,"In 30 years I've read something along the lines of 3000 books - everything from Shakespeare to pulp Star Trek novels. This one is the single best book I've ever read. I came to the book with a pretty good layman's understanding of physics and was better informed when I finished it. Meanwhile, my meager knowledge of art history was expanded dramatically. This is a book with something for both the left and right sides of your brain. What more could you ask for?"
1,"Great Topic, Poor Product","I loved the idea of the book so much I couldn't wait to get it home from the bookstore. But like other reviewers the treatment of physics and art quickly eroded my esteem for the book.But what frustrated me the most was how any and every theme in art that Shlain happens across can do nothing but prove his thesis: An artist paints something completely still and it represents time near the speed of light, another something that moves and it represents something else at the speed of light, an artist paints elongated forms and the same thing, shortened forms and you get length contraction.In short, there isn't anything artists COULD HAVE painted that Shlain couldn't have somehow connected to relativity of quantum theory.The book remains curiously novel, and it earns it's one star if only because I like it when people explain art to me so I can understand it. But no doubt there are better sources for that."
3,"Like the game, the expansion isn't that great","My 8 year old really loved the original zoo tycoon as well as the expansions. So when Zoo Tycoon 2 came out I was the first to buy it. The game was a big improvement, and he loved it even more. But the one thing he and I both noticed was the lack of certain basic zoo animals. I realized that the maker of the game might have purposely kept things skimpy so that they could cash in on expansion packs. I didn't mind the first expansion because it did add a lot of content to the game, this pack doesn't really give you a whole lot for your money. Now I am waiting for the inevitable dinosaur and water expansion packs. Hopefully they will give a little more for my dollar than this one did."
3,Boy's Briefs you can maybe fit into.,"I liked the collection of shorts on this film. You can read other reveiws for a full detail of them without repeating them over and over. Let me make my review ""brief"". GO WITH THE DVD VERSION. I haven't seen it, but the VHS quality is not good. Most ""picture this"" films have great DVD quality, so maybe this one will as well. The content is good, acting is very good for the most part. Attractive cast members playing lead roles. The hosts: Michael and Jason, are fun and entertaining. I'd like to have seen them go at each other affectionately but that doesn't happen either. I recommend this one but once again....... Buy it on DVD. I think you'll be a lot more impressed with it. One last thing: keep your expectations to a minimum. It would be easy for you to be really disappointed if you over-expect great film making here."
5,Three considerations,"After a quick glance at the other reviews, I didn't notice anyone mention that TY Ancient Greek has free, accompanying web material at [...]. (As with many Greek websites, I have to use Mozilla Firefox for full font support.) The extra readings and chapter review exercises help make the otherwise dense chapters easier to manage.As for the Sigma scandal, I don't think the choice to use 'C' and 'c' should discourage anyone from using this book. New learners will be digesting a whole new alphabet -- alternate versions of one letter shouldn't be an issue, let alone a fatal flaw.And finally, look at that freakishly low price! With the web exercises and a very appealing organization that immediately introduces the learner to exciting material, i really don't mind if they cut corners on layout and sigmas. Why not start with a $[...] book with a reasonably good reputation?"
3,Adorable durable doll except,This doll is very cute. Has nice clothing. Well made body but her hair comes of easily. The hair is like a wig and is glued to the dolls scalp. My little sister pulled all of the hair right off. Bottom line great doll to put on display or if your little girl doesn't mind a hairless doll.
4,A lovely look at Eire,Great descriptive imagery really brought out the sights and the feel of Ireland. Main character's hopes and fears were realistic and you could empathize with her. Stunning cover photo too!
1,bad buy,It does not fit the 2nd gen ipod nano. Feels like your going to break something in the process of figuring that out.
1,Not worth even $13.99,"There is static no matter which frequency I switch it to. And I've tried every single open one on the spectrum, with the antenna fully extended. Save your money and put it towards a better product.And don't leave the cigarette lighter plug in, even with the device disconnected, because it will drain your battery!"
3,beautifully disturbing!,"the album may not be in heavy rotation in my system but it's avant/ art rock sound is pleasing to my ears. I dont have a favorite track yet, but if you like my bloody valentine, mazzy star, jesus and the mary chain then you should like le volume courbe."
3,Ryan Cabrera goes himself way,"New album after ""Take It All Away"", second Ryan album after of the first ""Elm Street"" (acoustic CD, minority record tape, like a demo).Last album was produced by John Rzeznik, and this is sealed in the sound. Goo Goo Dolls feeling, and vocals and Rock instrumentation.You Stand Watching is produced and written only by Ryan Cabrera, the album like less. Lose strenght, melody and Rocker feelingThis album is more ""Pop Sound"" that ""Take it all away"", and the Ryan vocals are soundin' less raspy and now his voice is more high pitch and soft.Ryan is a great producer, composer and singer (also he plays guitar), this is his own sound,a Pop/Rock alternative album"
1,Is ANYBODY watching this hack?,"Wow, Ashleeeeeee's boyfriend has also decided to sanitize the already-polluted pop culture of 2005 even further! Hold on to your hats, America!To all my fellow lovers of MUSIC, keep hope alive. One of these days, the next Nirvana will come along and put an end to this pseudo-rotten mainstream, and this guy will go back to making milkshakes at Mickey D's. Maybe Scott Stapp can train him, unless he's too busy chastising The Baha Men for putting pickles on some hapless customer's Big Mac, or Hanson for oversalting the fries."
5,Ryan Cabrera ROX my redonkulously mismatched SOX off!,"Ryan Cabrera is absolutely amazing and he SHINES in this albulm. He has grown so much since his debut albulm, Take It All Away. He pours his soul out in this cd. There are some upbeat songs and then the amazingly beautiful slow songs. It has an amazing overall sound and balance. This is definatly a cd you want to add to your collection."
3,Bubblegum Pop with a Touch of Guitar,"Listening to him reminds me of BBMak or Jesse McCartney, and I'll admit it: I'm actually a sucker for this genre. I'm not a fan of love songs, and I do agree that artists that do this kind of music usually need to work on their lyrics and not sounding the same for the entire album, but still, I like the fact that they are tame, not trying to be controversial, and are quite devoted to ""you.""The only problem I have with Ryan Cabrera is the way he sings. He keeps exaggerating his breath-taking moment at the end of each sentence under the misguided mindset that it makes him sound sexier. Any attempt to sound sexier--especially when it fails--really bugs me.Irrelevantly-speaking, yeah, sure, I guess he's a hot guy material, but he really needs to do something about his hair. Hedgehog style is not cool."
5,I stood watching.. and it was good!,"once again ryan cabrera makes a pop cd that i actually like enjoy listening to. it's not one of those pop cds you buy and then listen to, cause you hear it on the radio a million times a day and can't get the damn chorus out of your head; you listen to this cd because it is amazing.one of my favorite songs on the new album, You Stand Watching, would defiantly be With You Gone. I can relate to the emotions in the song, and i'm sure i'm not the only one. everyone song on this cd is a hit, and i feel any song on this new album could be a single that will for sure make number 1 on the charts.i highly suggest you go to your nearest record store and get this album. it's a winner."
3,reflections,I was a little disappointed in the size and shape of the earrings. They are more flat than round. And I thought they would be heavier. But I'll wear them anyway.
3,Disappointed and returned them,"These earings are beautiful if you want the color to be more of a gold/yellow than a blue. They were very sparkly and well made; however, I just didn't like the color, expecially when I was expecting blue and lavender colors. They are definitely not clear."
3,Not like they are displayed,"These have a lot of sparke to them, however, they are not the color that they appear on the page. They are yellowish and I was very unhappy about that. I contacted the seller and they made a nice offer to remedy the problem. They are pretty though if you have something in that color palette to wear."
5,Georgous!,I bought these earrings as a gift for a friend of mine along with another kind. I let her choose and she went for these. The picture doesn't do them justice. They are not blue though but reflect the colors of their surroundings. I bought one pair for me as well by the way after my friend got hers.
3,"Not quite like the picture, but ok for the price.","To see these they don't much look like crystal to me. They have an opalescent appearance like they had some iridescent colors fused in them - but really they just pick up the color from whatever you are wearing. So that I guess is a plus - they will match whatever you wear with them.The clasps are solid, and these won't fall off easily which is a definite bonus.They are not as attractive as the photo though. I think the photo makes them look more ""expensive looking"" than they are in real life. That being said, I will still wear them from time to time."
2,Not a winner,"My 5-year-old son begged for this after seeing the commercials for it, and I don't think he spent more than 30 minutes playing with it once he finally got it. Firstly, the croc repeats the same 15 seconds of annoying insults and irritating laughter continuously. Fortunately, you can turn this off. Secondly, we tried a wide variety of cars and it was pretty rare to get any of them to drop down and land correctly. I couldn't get any of them to launch from the boat. My son has bought most of the Hot Wheels tracks released in the last couple of years, and this one didn't seem to be well designed at all for having fun. I would recommend passing on this track."
1,What happened to quality?,"I'm dissapointed in this product and have to say in Mattel. Do they test these products? My 5 year old son saw the product on TV and wanted it (oh, the power of advertising!), we bought it, and regret it. The set does not come with a car first of all and many of my son's matchbox cars do not fit the launcher. The launcher doesn't even launch. It just drops the darn car! The sound is annoying so don't bother buying batteries either."
2,Big disappointment,"We bought this croc for our son (5) who loves anything Hot Wheels and found that most of the cars don't work with this. Also, the sounds are annoying to the point of my son wanting it to stop.. which is very rare. Half of the time the crocs mouth won't drop shut, and I agree with one of the other reviews saying that it's nearly impossible to get the car in the boat. We tried and tried and got it in there once. Most of the time the car never even made it to the boat because it flipped over after dropping from the crocs mouth. Amazon is correct in charging only $5 for this toy, it's not worth any more than that."
1,extremely BORED by this book,I found this book so boring and I really get tired of these dumb heroes. Kurt decided to hook back up with his ex-wife because of his daughter who really was quite a bit older here. In the process he has to hurt his serious girlfriend Zoe who catches him liplocked with the ex-wife. Of course everyone tells Kurt this is a bad idea and of course he doesn't listen. When will someone listen to their friends and families? Especially when every single one of them are saying the same thing ~ the ex-wife is no good! The way the H/h are thrown together now because he is back in town and the whole other story line going on there . . . bored me to tears.
2,Be very careful,If you don't have furniture that will fit very well into the sunken circular hole then you're better off just putting the $20 under it. I have a daybed with tapered square legs and these raised it up but it wasn't very sturdy. When I moved it a bit one of the tabs on the side popped off. From the picture you would think that this is all one piece of wood but really those raises corners are glued on and aren't going to hold anything. I ended up going at them with my drummel tool and widening and squaring the openings so that the legs would at least sink into them. Even after all that I'm glad that it's up against a wall. While the plastic ones look a little cheap at least the fact that they flare out at the bottom give them much better stability. If your furniture fits in the plastic ones go with them.
3,E book came as promised.,The book just arived a week later than i would have liked but it was in good condition. I love reviewing psychology and this book has all the terms needed for my course.
2,Vocal Hernia,"Zakk pushed his voice beyond its limits on Mafia, and on this tour. Its really hard to take, and I'm glad he returned to his regular smokey voice on Shot To Hell.BLS are a great group, but Zakk's persistent use of this higher strained vocal technique scuttles Blessed Hellride songs that were sung in regular pitch on the CDs. Stoned and Drunk and Funeral Bell are critically altered to the point where I had to skip them.I'm actually starting to suspect that Zakk was using a vocal harmonizer tuned up an octave to achieve this effect, because I can't imagine how his vocal chords could withstand a tour sung this way.A few tunes sung this way I can handle, buts its total overkill on this DVD.The behind the scenes extras are enjoyable because Zakk is a funny guy."
3,Amateur short video project,The extras were longer than the feature movie. Jeremy's stand up was insightful about the industry. There was more nudity in the extras & hardly any in this short film.
5,Excellent introductory material,"Dr. Polhill has given us a well written introduction to Paul and his letters that reflects his many years of scholarship. He argues from a conservative evangelical perspective, but includes diverging opinions concerning authorship, provenance, etc. One of the strengths of this book is his detail in defining terms, people and places relating to Paul in Acts and his epistles. This will be a resource that I use often in the ministry and for personal use. I recommend highly to laypersons, seminarians and pastors."
3,Tight Fit,"Great Grips are a useful product. One thing about them, however: they are a tight fit. I have arthritis in my hands, and the grips are very hard to stretch over the china doorknobs in my elderly house. If I can get them on, sometimes they work their way off. When they stay on, they are fine."
3,Mind the Pitch,"So this is a good gong, but not exactly what I expected as you may have seen in some of the other reviews. I actually really like the size, but am not thrilled with the sound it produces - a bit higher in pitch than I'd hoped for. I've heard you need a larger one to produce the lower rumble."
3,"Great show, terribile packaging","I really enjoyed this show when it was on TV, however it did lose its way a bit after the death of Phil Hartman.Just a note on the packaging - be warned that it is one box with a spindle of CDs!"
5,Great series!,Much funnier than I remembered! Too bad the untimely death of Phil Hartman caused it's cancellation. It was a great cast!
5,Great seller on Amazon!,Product was just as described and I received the product quickly. Thank you! I would recommend this seller to anyone and will definitely use them again.
5,"Celine, always Celine.","Some will say that Celine only had one good book, ""Journey to the end of the night"". But i belive ""Death on Credit"" deserves a special credit. The irony runs strong in this book, like in all the Celine works.Just buy it folks."
1,top chef season 1,I haven't even seen this I don't know where it is and I don't know how to watch it even if I could find it. WHAT EVER HAPPENED TO DVDS
4,"Great candle, the label was a little messed up though.","When I received this candle in the mail the label sticker was crooked and kind of bubbled. Not a big deal, but wanted to mention it. The candle itself had no problems and burned properly, and smelled quite nice. If a crooked label sticker doesn't bother you than this is a good purchase, as the candle itself had no defects in quality."
5,Kalso Earth Shoe Solar Almond Vintage,"Received the shoes quickly and I absolutely love them! I was on the fence about purchasing them because of the price (but it was the lowest price anywhere on the web, thank you, Amazon!)and figured I deserved to wear good shoes. I have a pair of Earth brand sandals and have grown to love them. I find that when I wear Earth shoes, I sleep more deeply and soundly and I think it's because I get a bit of a ""workout"" by wearing them (although the ""workout"" is not really noticeable throughout the day, just a feeling of enjoying my steps more). So why would I wear anything else, I wonder?"
4,the negative heels are good for walking,"the negative heels are good for walking. i wear them to work, and then walk across 60 blocks home in nyc."
2,Meh,I was a little disappointed by the story. I think thenovelty of the assembly of all the classic Victoriancharacters has worn off.
4,not as good as loeg 1...,"but its still pretty darn good. there are also a few surprising moments in this book, two stand out in my mind. but overall the story is bigger but nowhere near as good or compelling as loeg 1.but this is still better than 99% of the other comic works out there, so you can't go wrong here."
2,Improvisation Non Starters,This wasn't very useful to me. It contains merely lists of possible conflicts and conversations one might base an improvisation around. The ideas arn't particularly imaginative and are nothing I or my students couldn't come up with ourselves.
2,Weak,"Inevitably, essays on 9/11 written in the days and weeks afterward suffer from the passage of time and new facts and information. These ruminations seem horribly stale and somewhat knee-jerk leftist. The essayist isn't just a poor man's Howard Zinn, but a very, very poor man's Howard Zinn. (And I like Howard Zinn.) Why do we care about his ruminations, again? He's a translator and editor of Latin American and Chinese poetry and prose. I'm not sure his thoughts on 9/11 are worth much more than my dog groomer's."
1,Weak,"Have read enormous amounts on this topic. This is by far the weakest, least informative, most useless material available. Don't bother."
5,The definitive book of Neuromuscular Junctions in Drosophila,"A must for every neuroscience library, as well as ardent collectors of drosophila information.This book is a well-edited collection of papers and attractive color plates. Although designed as a summary review of the current state-of-the-art, it also makes for a handy reference. Be sure to buy the hard-back edition."
2,What a wrong mixture of songs!,Even though the purpose of this CD makes it one to be acquired I would like to tell people that this is a very strange mixture of songs and one has nothing to do with the other. I agree that Madrededeus and Caetano are a must but I would much rather reccomend people to buy those artists CDs alone and not this one!
2,Better with a different author,"Perhaps the saddest part of this book is not the pain the author claimes to have gone through but rather, the pain she created for others in the process. If she were just a psychologist writing a book it would be different. After learning that she calls herself a ""minister"" and then learning of her sordid affair with Walker Railey, (a name worth researching), I read the book. How DARE she financially benefit from such a book. She may have once had her soul mugged-but she also mugged the soul of Peggy Railey and the Railey children!"
2,Item Returned,"Had to return mine - way too small, doesn't even reach my ears and my head is not that big... I only wear a medium women's helmet. Item was marked as ""one size fits most"" - most what? Also has a weird kind of strap that I guess is supposed to go around the back of your head... doesn't work well if you actually have hair. Really too bad because material is nice and print is very cute."
3,Imperfect collection of a special duo,"Womack and Womack are a soul act from the 1980s. Is that enough to make you go running? Don't go. This act is an unexpected gem.""Teardrops"" is an incredible song. The remix presented here is only slightly altered from the original. But I would have much preferred the original.I did not enjoy the live versions. ""Love Wars"" was robbed of most of its considerable merit.And as noted elsewhere, ""Baby I'm Scared Of You"" was not featured at all. Disappointing.I would strongly recommend getting ""Best Of 1984-1993: Strange & Funny"" instead."
3,womack womack,After I played the cd...I found it to be easy listening...both singers sound like beginners...I would not recommend this cd.
5,Pretty good -basic coverage,"I have had three text books which cover the material in this book and it is the most intelligible. I can't say that I really enjoyed it, but there is some good material and it is a pretty easy read without being uselessly lightweight."
5,Well written,"Anna only knows she is Jewish because her father says so. However it is enough to force the family to flee Germany (1933) due to the on coming of the Nazi regime. She will travel to several countries learning the language and staying one step ahead of the spreading Nazi influence. In her travels she learns of many concepts which include the confiscation of her ""Pink Rabbit.""Many books unintentionally talk down to children. Not this book it looks you right in the eye. Anna still maintains the innocence of her youth. But the problems and dealing with people can happen at any age.The story is told from the perspective of Anna. And not too surprisingly, it parallels that of the author and illustrator Judith Kerr who was forced to leave Germany in 1933.The Tiger Who Came to Tea"
1,Boring,I had to read this book for school and i hated it. I thought it was really boring. There was not any action in the book. I would not recomend this book to anyone that I know.
5,"Mystical, Magical, ...Wonderful","If you love adventure, mythology, magic, and other things like that, then I think you'll love this book. It's about three preteen/ teenage magis, Emily, Adriane, and Kara, who each have a special stone. Emily has the healing stone, Adriane has the warrior stone, and Kara, the blazing star, has the unicorn stone. In this book, the young magis find a herd of baby unicorns, who got lost on their way to unicorn school. But when the unicorns start sprouting their horns, is it to late? Plus, Emily has to deal with her dad's new love- her stepmother. Can they get the unicorns to Avalon, the source of all magic, befor it's to late? Find out by reading this book and all the others that come befor it in the Avalon seris."
3,"OK, BUT...","I am a big Willie Nelson fan, but not so keen on Ray Price and there was quite a bit of him on this one."
3,Almost perfect...,"Merle and Ray are awesome. Couldn't sound better. In fact, same as always...GREAT! Willie disappointed me a little bit. Does not sound like he used to on Red Headed Stranger or his 4th of July picnics of the early to mid 70's. I guess singing so many different genre's with all the great ones from BB King to Julio Iglesias got him out of whack somewhat. It's still a great DVD! My favorite here is Merle, Are The Good Times Really Over (I Wish A Buck Was Still Silver). This song alone is worth 5 stars. But I gave it 4 because of Willie."
5,Tom Jones BEST to date!,"Pure, Raw Tom Jones - at his Best. I heard his version of John Lee Hooker's Burning in Hell on XM Radio (Bluesville) Totally Blew me Away! Been a fan for years.Now I know 'Why'!!! I would buy the Album based on his rendition of Burning Hell."
2,Wrong Mixture,"Like many of you, I truly dig Tom's voice immensely. I've DJ'd on FM and done quite a bit of club work through the decades and have an eclectic and broad taste in music. Tom's rendition on the Blues DVD from 2002 of Ketty Lester's ""Love Letters"" with Jeff Beck is simply top notch. Praise and Blame can't touch the latter. This sounds like a CD Tom Waits, Leon Russell or even Dr. John would have been better suited singing. The CD has a stellar lineup of musicians..it's not them. The production and music are sparse and lean with an ole time 50's gospel/r&b/blues feel which altogether work well but Tom's voice just isn't well suited for this sound. The blend for the most part (not all songs) just doesn't work. ""Don't Knock"", ""Burning Hell"", ""Didn't It Rain"", ""Ain't No Grave"" and ""Nobody's Fault But Mine"" are the strongest contenders. I'm not suggesting Tom's voice doesn't shine, it's just the wrong mixture."
5,Love this Tom Jones,"Love this earthy version of Tom Jones husky voice. Love the rhythms, especially Run On. I am not religious, but I do love gospel music, especially with good rhythms. This is the first Tom Jones cd I have purchased. He has a great voice and I love this bluesy style."
4,A very good children's book,"When winter comes, frog finds that he is ill-adapted to the cold. Frog's friends, seeing his difficulty, rally around him, and help him through his time of troubles.I liked this book, the illustrations are well done and quite humorous, and the storyline is entertaining. I would have hoped for a little more educational value for this book, but my first-grader loves it. The words push him a little, which is good, and the fact he enjoys it so much shows him just how much fun reading is. By the way, he selected this book as his prize for a reading trial at school, he liked it that much."
2,"volume 3 lacks any real major 12"" singles","While volumes 1&2 were a good place to find some gems, volume 3 focuses more on the late 80s/early 90s, and there just aren't many big tracks here, other than a few billboard dance charts. Worse, the unfamiliar tracks were downright cheesy. track times:1. can i kick it (6:42)2. blame it on the bassline (5:19)3. roadblock (6:28)4. get busy (6:09) (this is the ""club mix"" from the original 12"")5. touch me (sexual version) (5:38)6. wee rule (4:53)7. i'm a wonderful thing (baby) (6:14)8. can i get a witness (2:59)9. too good to be forgotten (4:55)10. love's crashing waves (3:10)11. sweetest smile (5:22)12. lies (5:20)"
4,A must for young horse lovers!,"This is a funny, entertaining film, told by a brave courageous horse. It's great for the younger lovers of this title that might not fully understand the classic film or the newer version with Sean Penn. I highly recomend this to all horse lovers!"
3,not the history i expected!,"ok, i am into paranormal however, this series just doesn't cut it! too short when covering subject matter and didn't tell me anything that i didn't know already. in fact, i fell asleep watching one of the DVDs!"
4,Halloween must haves,"I used to watch these every year on the History Channel. Its to bad they dont run them during Halloween anymore, or at least make new ones. Some new insight on Salem would be nice."
3,Laptop Protection,This is a very nice bag for small laptops but wish it had a compartment for acessories
5,The Perfect Case,"The Edge I Sleeve for MacBook is just perfect for what need. The MacBook fits in snugly and securely, due to the ""Thick"" protective padding. Looks expensive but priced right. Love it, Great buy!"
1,I do not like it.....sorry,I am disappointed when I expect a repeat performance of Lost in Space.It is mediocre music without a characteristic.
1,Nikon zoom binoculars,Wanted these for travel and birdwatching. Too hard to focus and when you zoom you cannot hold them still enough to use. Not a good product. I am a Nikon fan and this product is not up to their standards.
1,Thermostats were off by as much as 12 degrees,The stats were not calbriated and were as much as 12 degrees off. We had to replace 24 of them with another brand.
4,Does what it says,"I live in the San Fernando Valley and in the summer, my greenhouse can get above 110F. I have lost a lot of plants because of this and decided I need to make some changes. I bought this thermostat and attached it to a swamp cooler. I did have to use an extension cord and splice the wires before attaching it to the thermostat. The thermostat works very well and has kept my greenhouse temps cooler. The only thing is the thermostat kicks in 8-10 degrees above what you set it to. For example if I set the thermostat to 80F, it won't run the cooler until the temperature hits 88F or 90F. Other than that, it works very well."
5,Simple thermostat,I installed this thermostat in my media closet to regulate the temperature. It seems simple enough that I won't have to worry about this thing failing.
2,terrible thermostat,"Terrible thermostat. These are not easy to come by, so I went with it based on its cheap cost. You get what you pay for. It doesn't have any sensitivity to changes in heat, so it's really just a 120V switch."
3,Where are the missing hits?,"Overall, I thought this was a nice CD. However, I am a bit mystified over some of Aaliyah's hits that were omitted, but I thought should have appeared to make it a true greatest hits CD:1) We Need a Resolution2) If Your Girl Only Knew3) Rock Da Boat4) The One I Gave My Heart To5) Four Page LetterFortunately, music videos for three of the above are on the DVD, along with:1) One In A Million2) Are You That Somebody?3) Try Again4) We Need A Resolution5) More Than A Woman6) Back in One Piece (feat. DMX)7) Four Page Letter8) Got To Give It Up (remix)9) Rock Da Boat10) Japanamation Commericial11) Aaliyah Behind The ScenesBut where does ""If Your Girl Only Knew"" appear on here?! That was my favorite Aaliyah song. The unreleased songs are all right, although I really would have preferred that ""All I Need"", ""Don't Worry"", ""Come Over"", ""Erica Kane"", and ""Don't Know What to Tell Ya"" have been replaced with the missing hits I've listed above."
1,not impressed,I am not impressed with this album. A couple of her last songs were ok. I just don't find her a great singer. She was a great dancer.Giving her one star was pushing it.
5,Great book!,"I had Dr. Blomberg as a professor and we used his book about the gospels. I am not of school, but I wanted a book that I could read fairly easily, but also would give me in depth study. The balance that this book provides is great. It's readable and enjoyable and yet Blomberg gives great insight into the scripture. I would definitely recommend this book to someone want an overview with some depth."
1,Errata,"No doubt, it may be a great book without more than 80 mistakes in it. I was really surprised when I opened the book and a piece a paper fall down from it! Where was the editor? Is it possible to have so many errors and horrors beginning with misspelling words, wrong quotes, mistakes all over! Unbelievable !!Of course, I wont recommend this book at all. Not with these kind of basic grammar mistakes.Hopefully, I'm returning it back to Amazon!Jose G"
4,'The song remains the same',This album appears to have been reissued a couple of times:[1] compare:O Lusitano (2005)...[2] compare:O Lusitano (2001)...___________
4,Quite insightful,"I purchased this book for my son, who is a USMC and was in Iraq. I started to read it before sending it to him and found it quite insightful and moving. I am not sure whether or not he read it but when he does, I know it will help him..."
3,Five stars for looks but zero stars for size!,"My daughter wanted a feminine-looking dress/work watch. When I saw this one with the crystals and the MOP dial, along with the off-set date window, I was hooked. Size-wise, the measurements looked ""nice"" also.When I got the watch I saw it was HUGE!! It looks like a man's watch, it is so big!I had to scramble to find something else for my daughter for Christmas and will be returning this one. Too bad too, since, except for the size, it is a beautiful watch."
1,Worst Balls Ever! Its just like a tennis ball??????,COme on I thought its a cricket ball an i got charged [...] bucks for 6 balls are u kidding me... I could buy twice the ball less cheaper in sports authority or any other sportss... its not about the money they charged. its too light weight the ball. Its really hard to play with this ball. I am really dissapointed with this ball. But i have to be honest the balls stay for a while. only one ball ripped so far i still have 5 of them with me... but not good for cricket...
1,Personal dissspointement,"I have bought through the internet a portable DVD. I was very excited about my purchase since it was a Christmas present for my son. Unfortunately, I does not work. I have tried several times to use it but it won't. I place the disk, it won't read it. It says, place the disk.My son has felt very sad about this incident. I live overseas and I am going through the hassle of returning the item for a refund.I do not understand how come a brand new item can be broken. I hope to get my money back soon in a credit card refund."
4,Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends - The Complete Season 1,We have a 12 and 14 year old at home and they love the cartoon. It is a great way for the boys to relax and have a good time.
1,Total waste of time,"This movie is a total waste of time .... unless you want to watch it to get a good laugh at the acting, directing, storyline, ugly wardrobe and senseless bathrobe scenes. If I could give this movie a minus star, I would. What an embarrassing flop!"
2,depressing,It was intense at times but overall the movie boring as it dragged on. It made little sence until the terrible ending. The flashbacks made no sence untill later but it would have been a little better without them.
2,THIS TURN GETS SCREWED,"This take on Henry James' classic TURN OF THE SCREW pales in comparison to 1961's THE INNOCENTS which featured an astounding performance from the late Deborah Kerr. This update lacks the sense of doom of that version, and LeeLee Sobieski is far from Kerr's league.This version brings the story into modern times and features the requisite lesbian love scene, which in my opinion, is turning up too much in our modern horror movies. There also isn't enough focus on the children's relationship with Quint and Miss Jessel and the ending lacks the dynamic impact of the INNOCENTS. Remaining still is the question: are there really ghosts or is the governess just batty? Stick to the INNOCENTS--it's a far better ghost story."
4,"Sensationalized ""New Hollywood""","Whenever author Peter Biskind has a chance to say something negative about the ""new"" crop of seventies directors, he does. This group of film freaks, eccentrics, drug users, and egomaniacs managed to take over Hollywood in the late '60's and early '70's. But despite the gossip (nude sunbathing at Margot Kidder's for example), Biskind has written a real page-turner. I couldn't put this massive tome down until I had finished it (roughly 4 days). Much of what's included has made it into the pages of the tabloid press. Checking Biskind's reference notes, I observed that many sources are the directors (or ex-wives) talking about each other. Having worked in Hollywood during this period, I noticed a number of omissions as well. However, I highly recommend this book. Just be careful about what you believe!"
2,"Fascinating, engrossing, but should you be viewing this.....","Don't quite understand the critics of the gossip in the book. It is obviously salacious and a selling point of the book. One wonders how any movie got finished, financed, much less of any quality, given their self destructve bacchannalia. The book could have been shorter and a better read as he includes many peripheral/or minor people. I don't rally have a great deal of interest in this particular era, but the book engrossed me and increased my curiosity about that period of filmmaking. I was left with a disturbing question of morality about such crazed people forging our cultural stories. Again, it's a marvel they produced works of respected art given their anti-saocial practices. Most drug people with these behaviors end up i prison, dead in the gutter and certainly forgotten even, by their mothers!!!!!!I was forced to question my interests in these works. Haven't answered them yet."
2,"Hard to Follow, Kinda Boring","I found it really hard to follow who the heck the author was talking about and who he was quoting. The way it was written, it just didn't flow, seemed choppy."
5,GIVE A THING A NAME AND IT WILL HAPPEN,"This book is a masterpiece! Peter Biskind is a formidable storyteller. This book is fun to read, it is intelligent. I can recommend this book even to the people who are not interested in books about Hollywood and the movies. This book reads like a series of short.stories, which in the end result in a great novel. Very intelligent, very funny, thrilling-Biskind is a genius."
2,Scandal Sheet,"Considering Biskind was, according to his bio, an editor at both Premiere and American Film, this book is disappointingly short on intelligent film analysis and grossly long on sexual histories, drug exploits, and mean gossip. The aesthetic dimension is virtually ignored other than general remarks about critical reception of the various films discussed, but the behavior of the directors (on and off set) is plumbed. Everyone comes out looking very ugly. So what? If you're looking for gossip and a few interesting anecdotes, this is for you. Good film or cultural history it ain't. The chronology is confusing, the narrative very loose, the spirit truly Hollywood scandal sheet. Too bad, because it could have been much more intelligent given the author's obvious access to sources. The author's focus makes him seem every bit as repellent as the directors he sketches."
3,Lots of Errors,"This book is an effective game programming theory lesson if you are a capable VB.NET Programmer who can figure out how to correct the numerous coding mistakes made by the authors. There are countless examples where they've accidentally dropped C# code blocks into the mix instead of VB, and many other occasions where they change variable names that should have remained the same. If you aren't well-versed in VB, I'd caution you against buying it...you're probably not going to be able to make it through without encountering errors that end your session in frustration.The book was still useful to me, as I needed to learn the theory behind game programming more than I needed the actual code, but it was still annoying to have had to figure out why the provided examples weren't functioning properly."
2,Don't be fooled,"Although this book isn't a complete waste of money, don't be fooled. It's not very well written.There are countless errors in the code right from the beginning. They also just skip telling you some important pieces about what is going on in every chapter.However, you can still squeeze some use from this book. Go to the web site and download all the code from them. For the most part, the code works and can be your reference. You *can* learn from this book and d/l code, but you have to work at it and use a lot of trial and error.Thank you for reading."
1,"Works for a while then, plunk","My experience is the same as the other reviewer. This item worked fine for a while, then it started erratically disconnecting and screwing up other devices connected to the USB bus. So far Belkin is batting 0/3 --- the failures of: 1) the F5U234 USB hub, 2) my Belkin 4-port ethernet router, which would black out under too much traffic, and 3) myBelkin MasterCube F9H120-CW 1-Outlet Wall-Mount Surge Protector, which short-circuited and blew the breaker at the hotel I was staying in. I will avoid Belkin and choose other brands in the future. I replaced Belkin F5U234 hub with aPlugable USB 2.0 10 Port Hub (with Power Adapter)which I hope will work better. I replaced the Belkin ethernet router with an AppleAirport Extreme 802.11N (5TH GEN)and it works great."
1,Don't waste your time,The only thing I regret is not the money I spent but the time I wasted reading this book. But I guess there are enough 3rd graders out there who will enjoy it.
5,Love this!,"I bought this collection for my husband's birthday and he really couldn't be happier. The show was truly funny and the quality of the DVD's is just fine. If you're a fan of Sanford, this is a great gift."
4,"Good content, poor packaging","This book is, for those of us who love postsecret.com, simply more of what we love. However, the book binding doesn't allow the book to open flat, and several postcards are formatted to fit across both pages, so there is often a chunk of card that you can't see in the middle. At the very least, the effect is lost on several postcards purely because you're annoyed. Still, can't beat the content."
3,Suffers from Poor Layout and lukewarm secrets,"Someone made the strange decision to have quite a few PostSecrets cover two pages. In those cases the fold makes it difficult to read and destroys the visual impact of the post card. That really irked me.The other is that maybe 20% of the secrets take up an entire page. Thus they look like billboards rather than post cards.Frank Warren did a poor job on the layout of the book, which really minimizes much of the emotional impact.Also diminishing the overall impact was Warren's selection of which cards to publish. There were far too many lightweight/trivial ones included in the book. Lessens the overall emotional impact and makes the book seem superficial like Chicken Soup For The Soul. I know from faithfully reading tghe postsecret web site that Warren had a lot more dramatic cards he could have ncluded.I bought it as a present for my daughter.."
3,Same as Blog but in a book,"Same as online blog but more and better ones. Quick read, but good to keep around. I gave it to some friends to check out. Still amazes me what some people go through in life. If your feeling bad about your own life, seeing how bad some other people have it just might make you re-evaluate your own."
5,I love picture books.,"There is a lot of mental and visual stimulation throughout this book. This is a great coffee table book. My friends come over and flip through it, and they think it's very interesting as well."
5,tiny windows,This book has the extraordinary ability to allow the reader to open a tiny window into the secret lives of everyday people. These little exposures are thought-provoking and can remain with you. The reader will be able to relate to the secrets that other people keep. Once you start reading this book you will not be able to put it down !!!!!
4,450 Foot Pack,"A bit awkward to punch out the holes for the locks and you have to be careful of the rubber skirt, but otherwise an easy installation and feels solid."
4,Very good product...,"Hi quality silkscreening on both sides, and close to authentic! Very good seller to deal with. Would do business with again!"
5,fascinating stuff,And we thought in this day and age we are clever engineers. This is an amazing look at the ingenuity and resourcefulness of builders from the past. A wonderful mix of history and curiosity as to how things were built.
2,Sorry to say,"short 3-second images, coming back again the same.Sorry to say, this is not the level I'd like to see.Intereasting subject presented in MTV-way."
1,"Planning (perhaps Scheming), but not Engineering","I just replied to Not for engineers, architects, builders etc., May 30, 2010 By David Holubetz and said:Thank you. I thought I saw the show about the Parthenon on the History Channel and thanks to your review I continued looking. The show I was looking for aired on PBS ""Nova: Secrets of the Parthenon"" which shows what little we modern folks know about ancient Greek Architecture. The NOVA show gives some very cool Engineering and exceptional Architectural insights. I guess I'll post this as well. Thanks again.So is ""Engineering an Empire"" only worth 1 star? I rented Volume 1 and found it to be entertaining, but I don't want it for reference in my Library. I tend to read the 5 star then I read the 1 and 2 star reviews too. Had I not seen the 2 star review by David, I may have bought the wrong show based on the Engineering title and the glowing reviews, instead of renting it. Hope this helps you."
5,Interesting,"Those DVDs helped me to understand who people from accent centuries lived. Actually I was surprised how advanced their life was! I never thought of that. But I guess some people will get board of it, I am not! I enjoy documentaries."
3,brief and readable,This is an option for third year medical students who want a brief and readable review book in a prose rather than bullet point style. However it is by no means comprehensive and more in depth resources such as a surgery textbook should be utilized for presentations or for detailed investigation. It is suitable for the third year clerkship level.
2,made in china,"poorly made, noisey, not worth a dollar much less 23 dollars....gig is smaller than picture appears, very much made in china"
5,Definitely this is a must have,"One of the best books I've ever purchased. The tracks are great and I specially enjoyed the Jazz tunes as I always wanted to play Jazz with a band and the tunes made me feel part of one :)The variations to the main groove are fun and very educative as some of them are not easy and makes you think and practice and try for a while, but after you realize how to play it, then it feels like a reward!The click-less tracks are a very good idea as I've found that it improves one's sense of time.I hope to see a Drum Fills Essentials sometime soon...Thanks Tommy for your great work!"
3,pretty good,"Good variety, realistic charts, good commentary, some of the groove suggetions are a bit busy but overall, very good product. My only gripe is that its hard to hear the click sometimes."
5,"A serious drum for kids, not a ""toy"" drum.","We first encountered these in the nationally popular Music Together[TM] class that we enrolled our kids in our local area. We knew immediately that we had to have one. And we were overjoyed to find how cheap they are on Amazon.This is the real deal—it's a drum. As in, an actual drum that you can make actual music with, adult and child. Take it to the drum circle if you want.As a bonus, it's durable, well-made, and designed in such a way (colorful artwork, rubber feet, lightweight, rubber-tipped stick) as to be kid-friendly in every way.This is light years ahead of any toystore drum (most of which are pale excuses for any sort of musical instrument, if they even manage to be that) and for the price is an absolute steal."
5,Fabulous music extremely well performed,This was my first DOMUS CD and I liked it since the first time I heard it. The playing of this group is outstanding and the recorded sound is simply beautiful especialy the harmonium in the five bagatelles.I love Bohemian music and this music is a splendid sample of it.The Adagio of the Suk's Piano Quartet in A minor is a true masterpiece.If you are a music lover you have to buy this CD immediately!
1,Should be recalled,This is an awful purchase. The base is very unsafe. It will not stay upright no matter what you do.I wish we had read the other reviews before we purchased.
4,This is NOT a dangerous product,My husband and I received this as a gift. I was concerned with the bad reviews as any parent would be so we took the car seat to our fire department and they showed us how to properly install it. I asked the fireman if he saw any dangers with this carseat and they all agreed that it was perfectly safe. The difference to what we were doing and what they did was when they installed the base they put all of their weight on and then pulled the belt secure. It made all the difference.The only thing that I don't like is the carseat is heavy and it will not fit into a shoping cart.
2,Not a good purchase,"I am currently searching through the reviews of all the strollers so I can replace my Eddie Bauer travel system, I figured I should also put my review in...This stroller is very big, hard to push around stores, and impossible to steer with one hand. It does have a lot of room for diaper bags and shopping bags. the cup holder/tray is also very convenient. BUT the most important things...it gets stuck when folding it up and the base of the infant seat is awful. I've also found that the infant seat is larger than most and doesn't fit onto shopping carts. Mine is a year old now and I'm not sure if they have made improvements on this model already. I would definitely look into another brand before spending your money on this one."
1,Eddie Bauer Car Seat Base,This is an UNSAFE SYSTEM AND NEEDS TO BE RECALLED ASAP BEFORE A CHILD DIES!! Looked in my back seat and my 3 week old infant was tilted almost tipped over due to this base. Returned the entire system and got Graco Metro Lite and I am VERY pleased with it. I pray they recall this system before an innocent infant loses its life!!
1,please don;t buy,This is the worst set up that I have ever seen please report it so that it can be recalled before a child is hurt~ I refuse to use mine due to the saftey issues. I am now out over $200 for a seat that is not used. Please call the company and complain I did and they told me they dont; know these things unless people let them know. They need to pull this one.
4,I love this movie.,"""Never Let me Go"" is a wonderful movie starring Clark Gable and Jean Tierney. It is full of Romance and adventure. Gable is a Journalist in Russia at the end of world war II.Tierney is a ballerina. They both fall in love , get married, and try to leave Russia by plane. The Russian officials prevent this from happening. Wife and husband are seperated. It is now up to Gable to figure out a way of getting his wife out of Russia. He risks his life for the woman he loves. Now, that is love.Please, release this movie onto DVD."
1,glad I rented it first,"I rented this game for my 4 year old who is a very good gamer! The main problem that I saw was the fact that there is so much reading involved. For younger children, that would be a problem. As I sat there reading every paragraph for my son, I realized that it is a very boring game! Make sure you rent it first!"
1,"Oh, I wish I hadn't wasted my money!","It's terrible. I bought this for my daughter for Christmas because her older brother was getting new games, but NONE of us have been able to conquer the camera angle problems and that problem of Scooby getting in the way. Take my advice (and the advice of others here), rent it first. We have tried over and over, but just give up in frustration after about 15 minutes of play. Oh, man! I could have bought MYSELF something with that money!"
3,My kids like it,"We bought this used, so all of the 'goodies' of the original purchase were not included.My kids do like the game and have had a fun time playing it."
3,Only ok,"From far away it looks good, but the material isn't very high quality and that is noticeable up close. For the price, if you just need things to match it's fine."
4,Worth the price!,"I am very pleased with this bed set. It even washes nicely. I have a child and pets that love to sleep with us and so far its holding up great! I recommend this product for anyone looking for a nice, classy, durable bedding set!"
4,Nicely done,"This movie was much better than I expected. I figured it'd be nothin' but S&M scenes, but I was pleasantly surprised to see that there's actually a story there."
4,nice but noisy,"Costco here too. 180 was a great price, but the hissing has become annoying. It does sound like a larger capacitor....its constant...constant. i hear it walking through the room passing within 8-10 feet of the unit. the noise dissapears when tray is open, only. i really like it, but the hiss is getting to me. I notice its on sale here for $129. Maybe ill shop around, spend a bit more."
2,Another duh lesbian guide,"Why is it that these comedians write as if we all have below average IQs? This book was only good for me to show to new dates that they should not talk about the exes on a first date. After that, it was Common Sense 101. I would have like for Mo to use her college degree and skills to write for those of us who actually can read/enjoy facts and mature suggestions."
3,master managers,"I found that this book was a great supplement to other textbooks. I would advise against using this book as a main course staple. While this textbook does offer many helpful tecnigues for becoming the master manager, it should only be used for a personal leason. I found that using this textbook as my main course matrial did not work well, as I was often using other textbooks. There are many parts that tend to be dry and lead a reader to skim the matrial rather than read throughly."
4,Snow,"i would have to say this game is awsome. it has pretty good graphics and the tricks are pretty realistic instead of the cheesy tricks where you can do triple backflips, you actually can do realistic tricks like rodeos, corkscrews, mctwist, ect. the only thing bad about this game would have to be the grabs, in the game the snowboarder reaches down to grab, i think it would be and look better if they brought the board up to them more like in real life. also, the competitions, they are fun but they are way to short and you only have one try in each competition in the snowboarder mode, you should be able to have the best of 3 or something. i think it is cool how you work your way up to getting sponsored and get filmed. i haven't played cool boarders 2001 or ssx YET, but i think a real serious snowboarder, sorta like myself, would really appreciate this game mostly on its realistic tricks and how you can get sponsored."
5,Another Real Winner,"Azucar's story continues with horrid realism and shocking truth. I have been to the Caribbean a couple of times but I never once thought about the reality of life behind the fantasy world of the beautiful tropics. Cambeira's descriptions of nature are absolutely breathtaking. His portrait of the characters, all ten years older and more circumspect, is awesome. I really was impressed by his honest treatment of globalization and its effects on the lives of the masses of people in the Third World. The author drives this point home in unapologetic terms. This is good, honest writing. This is a wonderful story and it is told skillfully. Cambeira has given us another real winner. So real and truthful. So brutally frank. Without reservation, I recommend this book as well as his first one in the series."
2,Speeches Not Monologues,"The problem with this book is that the monologues sound like students getting up in front of class and giving a report that was assigned to them. They don't sound like monologues where there is a strong need to affect another person and try to get a response from them immediately. The topics are good, but they don't sound natural. They're too speechy, like you're saying them to the world for no reason."
4,Genocide,"I watched this DVD and wonder why we still go on killing each other for any reaason at all? Jesus said to love our neighbor, but it seems we do the opposite."
4,A good game with room for improvement,"This game is a pretty solid game. The graphics and play animations are really good. Many of the faces are correct, as well as the body shapes, mainly a star or two from each team looks really correct. You can add features to all your favorite players that you know they have such as there hair style, sweat bands, knee braces, sock length, head band, or elastic bands for their wrists, which is cool. The announcing flows pretty well, but sometimes they do get repititve. The gameplay is a little slow, but there are some cool, moves, and good jams. A couple things this game doesn't have are street ball, and a turbo button. However over all this is a very good game, and I think it is better than NBA LIVE 2001 for ps2. This game is a good buy."
2,"This game is bad, very, very bad","Don't buy/rent this game. It is bad. The control is awful, players stop moving completely when they come into contact with an opposing player. Secondly, they will not move after you fake out a defender, the ""killer cross-over dribble"" is far from ""killer"". The create a player is cool, but the gameplay is awful. There is no draft like advertised. Just don't get this game, you have been warned"
4,DA BOMB!,"This game is the bomb. Don't listen to the people who say there is no turbo, just use the analog stick.It has incredible graphics and great moves. The only flaw is that it is a little bit to easy, but other than that, you should buy this game."
1,not fun-not smooth-do not buy,Nbalive2001 is great and nba hoopz kicks a$$. but this game just doesn't do it for me. i'm a serious gamer and i have hoopz and live and this game deosn't even come close.(i rented it). I know live doesn't have franchise mode but at least they didn't advertise it then not put it in the game(like nba2nite did). graphics are nothin to do a dance about and gameplay is horrible. But as i have read some people have found to enjoy it. so not knowing the people reading this review i suggest renting it and find out for yourself.
2,hhhhhmmmmmmmm,"what happens when you take a successful arcade game and translate it to a console? success right? WRONG- in this case that is. This game was great in the arcade due to the inovative use of a rifle and scope. But when you take that away all you have is a very bad ""Area 51""-esque game. This game should have never been translated to ANY console and you will notice this quickly after playing for a minute or two. The controls are sluggish and just like any other shooting game that doesn't have a gun peripherial, it gets boring FAST. Only get this game if it is the only game you can find when you are buying a PS2."
2,A mainstream recording,"David has one of the best voices I've ever heard. His previous albums musically allowed his voice to shine. ""Revelation"" contained fresh, original-sounding songs, and who can forget ""End of the Beginning"" from ""David Phelps""? I can't pinpoint my disappointment other than to say that most of these songs just sound like mainstream Christian pop. They sound fairly generic. Perhaps the record company is shooting for marketability which is unfortunate. ""Gentle Savior"" is the standout song and is among David's best. I'm anxiously awaiting his next album. His talent deserves so much more."
2,Double Dipping,"It looks like comic publishers have fully reached the point where they are now comfortable double-dipping their customers in the same way DVDs are double-dipped (like Sin City, Lord of the Rings). The Ice Haven hardcover book is like an improved, deluxe version of the original paperback comic. When I originally read the comic, the formatting seemed weird: the pages seemed like they should have been presented in a horizontal format (like they are in this hardcover collection). The problem with this double-dipping publishing strategy is that it will scare people away from buying the original comics if they know they are going to get double-dipped later. I know I won't be buying anymore 'Eightball' comics knowing I'm going to get double-dipped later. Should you buy this comic? Yes, if you don't have the original comic. If you already bought the original comic, you'll live without this reprint. But I'd hold off on buying any future issues of 'Eightball.'"
4,"Golly, I Was Excited About This","See I just got back into comix relatively recently, and I have a big old crush on Clarence Darrow- so I thought Clowes' take on the Leopold Loeb case was gonna put the some in awesome! And, I dunno. It was very good. Technically stunning too. Just... um... not cold really, but distant. He explores some of the same themes in the DEATH RAY issue of EIGHTBALL. You just have to wait three years then you can buy it in a book store (instead of a comic book store) for three times the cover price. It'll be worth it. You don't want to get caught walking out of a comic book store, do you?"
1,Did not get what I expected,"I received this twice as a gift. Both times one of the wooden dolls was not included. When I called, they said they would fix the problem and go ahead and order again. NO WAY will I take a chance a third time."
3,Not durable,"Love the illustrations,very girly and no Barbie in sight. The problem is that the magnets don't stick very well. When my five year old stands the doll up, the clothes fall off. Also, the wood itself is durable but the picture is just glued on paper. On the first day, the ballerina was peeling on the sides. Five stars for cuteness but three overall."
5,"If you need a met, this is the one","I am a music education major studying oboe, and I have been using this metronome for almost 2 years and haven't had a problem at all. All the controls are simple, straight forward and work wonderfully. The only downside is that you need an adapter to use headphones which is a bummer, but that's not a necessity anyway. It stands up, is incredibly durable (falls off of my stand all the time, hardly a mark on it) and the batteries refuse to die. It has several rhythm settings, which are fantastic. I highly recommend this item to anyone who needs a metronome."
5,Does what it's supposed to.,"This small and lightweight metronome is easy to use, has all the features I need, and those are pretty accessible even without reading instructions. Small, loud, regular, and no swishing arm to tempt the cat."
4,Like the ease of use and the compact size,"This metronome is very easy to use even for a child. It is compact, smaller than an iPhone. The sound is a little sharper than I had expected. The light flashes so you can choose to mute the sound and go by the flash light. But I wish there was a way to turn off the light. Overall, this is a good compact metronome to use to play piano and I deducted one star for the features that I don't like."
3,cheap but adequate,"somewhat cheaply made; and when tightening straps it tends to pull the guard out of position, but otherwise does an adequate job."
4,very practical,"yes this is a very practical piece of equipment to have, though i wish there were sizes for longer arms."
1,Horrible customer service,"I ordered this item on the 31st of March. It is now the 10th of April. The shipping estimate they gave me was from April 6th to the 11th. I recieved an email today that they do not have any of this item in stock, when in fact if you look at this item, it says IN STOCK. They ""say"" that they shall be getting more in stock in June. More than a week has passed and they have neglected to inform me that they were out until just now. They took my money and gave nothing in return. Horrible customer service. They really should be ashamed and embarrassed by this. Canceling my order and never ordering from them again."
3,book review,"It was okay as a light book read but if you are looking for something with ""meat"" this isn't the book for you. It was interesting as I live near Augusta and have been to the Masters so was familiar with the area."
2,Pink Foam Rollers,I found the clips on the end of the roller very difficult to attach and release. I should have probably purchased a larger size.
1,Would have given less than a one if I could have,"These are truly miserable, they tangled my daughters hair, left it in such horrid condition that we had to take her to a saloon for a deep conditioning treatment. The foam that is used is very cheap."
2,Feldman does his best to keep the Dead Horse going,"Feldman does his best, but this book--a follow up to THE DIARY OF JACK THE RIPPER--is ultimately diappointing. Too many books have dealt with too many aspects of the Diary in recent years, and the sum total of it all leaves Feldman fighting a tide of circumstantial evidence with even *more* circumstancial evidence. Maybrick, while intriguing as a suspect, ultimately appears to be as much a victim of the Diary hoax as everyone else."
3,Decent treatment of the DaVinci myth,"I would like to change this to four stars, but Amazon won't let me.A lady at church handed out copies of this book to everyone last weekend. The book is short - 99 pages. I received it Saturday and had it finished by Tuesday. As another reviewer said, it is written as a conversation between three college students - Chris (a Christian), Matt, and Matt's girlfriend Andrea. They see the movie, then do a study on the book together.That's the first four chapters. Chapter 5 is a discussion between them about Jesus and the Bible. Chapter 6 is a basic gospel presentation.The book is written at a low grade level - perhaps 6th. Whether this is a strength or a weakness is a matter of perspective.The information in the book refuting the claims in ""The DaVinci Code"" seems solid. I needed to have a highlighter in one hand as I read. The book contains an extensive bibliography at the back.Overall, not a bad book. It really does have a lot of good infomation."
2,Not what was expected...,The Koss earbuds I have had in the past were GREAT. They usually are plastic that fits in the ear and have great sound. THESE ARE NOT THAT KIND OF EARBUD!!! They have a foam outter layer that comes off really easily and it is difficult to get it back on if it comes off...also the sound quality was SOOOO horrible that if I was trying to listen to a song and walked by a car that was turned on...I could not hear any music because a car engine (not even reving) was louder than the sound these put out! DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THEM!!!
4,Love the fabric!,"I wear these saraongs over my bathing suit all summer ~ I love them! I needed a new, solid color one and I chose the eggshell color. The only thing I have to say is that the color in the photo is much darker (which is what I wanted)...the one I received was very, very pale, similar in color. Just a lot lighter. It's fine...it will do; just wish the color was closer to the photo.The material is soft and appears that it will be super comfy. Ties easily...it would be cool to have the ""ties"" that they sell, but they are certainly not necessary. It's relatively thin material, so I wouldn't recommend it as a dress as some of the photos show. You might be able to double it up and work it as a top of some sort; I'll use it for my bathing suits:)"
5,Lots of fun!,This is a very simple step by step drawing book. It uses shapes and lines to create some impressive looking animals. The book uses colors that are eye catching and appealing to children. Both my 5 year old daughter and I learned to draw some great looking animals. This book and others in the series helped a hopeless artist survive kindergarten homework that required drawing.
5,Great child's drawing book!,"This was a great book for kids to learn to draw animals from. My 5 1/2 year old daughter is really into it, and even the boys in the neighborhood enjoy using it too!"
4,Great buy!,"My son's preschool has this book and when I saw what he could draw from it, I knew I had to get it. He has never been much into drawing, but with the help of this book, he really enjoys it! It's a great book!"
1,snooze fest,"I have been following Frisell since his ECM years and all of those albums out shine most of his current material. His playing has mellowed with age. What put Frisell on the map in the first place, his loops and delays and unique approach is almost gone. Check out Naked City or his ECM albums and you will hear his screaming, otherworldly tones that are almost all gone. He has taken the guitar to further places than anyone since Hendrix, and that is all gone. The reviewers of this album must discover his earlier more aggressive exploring of the guitar, still ethereal and supportive yet more urgent and rockin'. I highly recommend Mark Johnson's Bass Desires with Scofield, or Frisell's Lookout for Hope or Before We Were Born. I guess I'm not into his country and americana leanings which other musicians do better -"
3,Disappointing,"My 3 year-old son LOVES tub toys, especially tub squirters, so I thought these would be perfect - given his obsession with Thomas the Tank Engine. And truth be told, he does like playing with them. But ...* they don't float upright! They float lying on their sides.* they're stiff & difficult to completely fill with water. If you want the water to squirt out the top of the train's funnel (like steam) they have to be totally full and you have to squeeze pretty hard. It's too difficult for my 3 year-old. When only partially filled (which is normal) you have to turn them upside down to get them to squirt. They squirt well like that - a nice steady stream - but kind of defeats the purpose.Overall, my son likes them, but does get frustrated when they don't float upright. He likes playing with them out of the tub too. But, if I would have know the above things, I'm not sure I would have bought them. Even though they are only $10."
3,Kids love them but they are stinky,"My son, almost 2 loves this toy. He wants to play with them constantly but I have to keep them in the bath due to the ""vanilla"" scent. They really stink. I agree that anyone that is sensitive to smells should avoid this product."
3,"Fun, but not very functional","They're fun, I guess (it's hard for me to think like a 2-year old). They don't float upright. The squirt hole is at the top and the plastic is rather firm, so that feature is not really very useful, especially for small children. Maybe they're better on dry land. Note that each package might contain different Thomas characters.Still, for $10 they are a reasonable buy."
2,Very weak spoof,"The only thing I can think of is that the director was trying for a Mel Brooks feel. What he got instead was an incredibly unfunny satire. This one really looks weak when compared to Go Tell the Spartans, which was in itself not a first-rate movie. Perhaps with better writing and a more measured approach it could have been a better film."
5,Called to Heal: African Shamanic Healers,"This account of the South African healers is as accurate as you can get! Susan was ""chosen"" by the traditional healers to share their story with the world and she has done an incredible job. Her interviews and personal stories of Africa make the reader feel like they are in Africa experiencing the adventures with Susan.The African healers are gifted shamans who serve both rural and city people, working in partnership with Western-trained doctors. I trained with PH Mntshali in Swaziland and met Maseko and others. They all speak highly of Susan and are very proud her. This is a must read!"
2,In One Word - BORING!,"I usually stick with nonfiction but got this book thinking it was nonfiction by accident. It was set up to read like a memior which I was happy about but it was SO BORING. The 'trials and tribulations' are trivial. The family is no more dysfunctional then anybody else's family.The mother has mild depression and the two daughters have an outstandingly caring step-father. The book was suppose to be full of humor and by the end of the book I was still waiting to find this humor. Nonfiction has a reason to be common place whereas I expected Fiction to be more outrageous and outlandish. This book, to me, just seems to fall very flat."
4,Rabble Starkey,"Rabble Starkey was an A++ book. One day Rabbles dad ran off with another person and left Rabble and her mom to fend for themselves. So then Rabble finds her and her mom living in the garage of a rich friends house (the Bigelows house). Then Mrs. Bigelow gets sick and has to go to the hospital. If you like suspenseful, fun to read stories than you have to read ""Rabble Starkey"". Another book I recommend is ""Number the Stars"", also by Lois Lowry."
4,A positive look at Islam,"If you really want to meet Islam this could be one of the books you read but it must be one among many. I give Deacon Dardess two stars for learning Arabic and and two stars for going to an Islamic Center to get a better understanding of his Muslim neighbors. And then sharing the insights he gained from this hard work with his readers. I hold back one star, because the book lacks an index."
2,Stick to the TV series,"Yes, they've made a movie out of Densha Otoko, but it hasn't the heart of the original television series. Whereas on the show, comedy was mixed in with emotion for the genuinely geeky otaku, in this film, they've basically take a pretty boy Japanese actor, put a bad wig and glasses on him, then guess what? half way through the story they give him a makeover, and voila! he becomes a pretty boy again. puleez. Two favorable points about this film, The TV actors makes a cameo at the very end, picking up the continuity for the TV movie, Densha Otoko Deluxe. Train Man: The Movie exists within the 'world' of Train Man, that is, when his story became famous in the TV series, they made a film out of his life, being this film. After its release in Japan, they made Densha Otoko Deluxe, wherein they show posters for the film and ridicule it. The film's release has made all otaku celebrities, and women hound them wherever they go. Complicated."
2,Old-school gaming,"Being a fan of the Gradius series, especially G3 for the old Super NES, I rented this title to see what it was like, and I was a little dissapointed. The gameplay was exactly the same, but something was just missing. The Super NES version of G3 is the superior, as it had better music and a kickass intro of the Vic Viper launching. Here, all you get are still shots of previous Gradius box artwork. But the newly-created into cinematics were awesome. Maybe Konami should look into creating a new Gradius game, one designed to take advantage of the PS2's power.So pick up this title only if you have all the other games and need Gradius 4 to finish your collection, which, being a newer game, has much better graphics and sound. Plus, everything is polygonal instead of sprites so it looks 3D."
2,Regression - extremely disappointing,"When I saw that there were PS2 adaptations of Gradius III and IV, I was extremely excited, having seen friends play Gradius V in times past. This disc is NOT an adequate substitute for Gradius V. The games appear to run in an emulator at low resolution without any new graphics whatsoever.A previous reviewer has the idea: the SNES version of Gradius III is far better. This version actually has fewer weapons and options! Furthermore, I don't know if this is related to my config or what, but the only sound on this disc comes from the intro movie. The games are played in silence."
1,Waste of PS2 power!!,"This game is a lousy display of the PS2's power. It's not even 3-D! A side scrolling game on a 128 bit system? What a joke!! I beg you, at all costs, leave this game on the shelf where it belongs, and buy a real piece of software for your PS2, like Dead or Alive Hardcore, SSX snowboarding, or Smuggler's Run. Unless you want your grandma to able to get in on the gameplaying, and don't want too much of a challenge for her!"
3,Average Quality kit lens - overpriced and outdone by cheaper 18-55,"This lens came with my D200 kit. I found its quality lacking, and prefer the Sigma 17-70 (same price) and the much cheaper Nikon 18-55 (see my review under that lens). There is significant barrel distortion at the 18 focal point, the lens is heavy, and both the Sigma 17-70 as well as the Nikon 18-55 produce sharper photos. The extra 55-70 focal distance adds little to the third-the-price, less than half-weight 18-55. This lens is what I consider a standard good ""Kit"" lens. If you are a Nikkor-brand snob, then it will suit you fine. If not, look a the Sigma 17-70 for the same focal distance, or the Nikon 18-55 for a general excellent quality light walk-around all-purpose lens."
4,try to figure out the lens,it is a learning experience. I am havinf focusing issues.... otherwise when the pictures are clear.. the lens is great
5,This one's a side-splitter!,"The Book of White Trash made me laugh out loud. I took it to work, and everyone loved it! Very funny material, and the illustrations are great. We all have a bit of ""white trash"" in us (no matter what color we are) which makes it just that much more funny. Makes a great gift, too!"
3,What's with the title?,"While I liked this book because it takes place in the Star Wars universe, it didn't live up to the other books in the New Jedi Order series. Many elements in the plot seem too unbelievable (i.e. do you really think that Han and Leia would go so long without talking? She's a diplomat and they both have hot tempers, they are sure to blow up at each other one of these days...) And what was with leaving Mara completely out of the book? The breakthrough at the end of the last one when she was healed was great, but it was basically ignored in this book. We only got Luke's comments on it and nothing about how she was feeling. Also, was it just me, or did this book have very little to do with the Jedi? They were too much of a subplot to have the title refer to them. Anyway, maybe I just want to see Mara and Corran back in action. :-)"
4,Excitement at the very end of the book,"From the Heroe's trial, i got the feeling of a resurrection of the Han Solo's character, but in this book wasn't good enough. Jacen gets on my nerves again. And the Jedi seem to get more apart again. The conclusion of this book makes it worth to read all the pages, nice way of relating 4 or 5 stories that seemed isolated into this end. We are lacking for a victory. Everything is too parcial. The agent of chaos I is better, but i definitely recommend this one for the true fan of NJO and SW.Regards from Guatemala"
2,Not too happy with this book,"Sorry, I just don't like this book very much. Solo is hands-down my favorite character in the Star Wars universe, and I feel that Luceno's storyline is not doing him justice. This is due, IMHO, to an attempt to cram too much into a couple hundred pages. I agree with a previous reviewer that this novel (and the entire NJO series) feels like it was rushed into production using a set formula (must have ALL the surviving Heroes of Yavin AND some history AND be under a certain number of pages in order to make budget). In short, it is a valiant effort, but tries to do too much in a relatively short book."
2,The NJO series just isn't getting any better...,"The plot was mildly interesting but not enough happened in order to keep the book entertaining. It follow's the same basic concept of all its predicesors: the Republic is about to accomplish something but in the end the accomplishment is foiled by the Vong and they get one step closer to Coruscant. Nothing is accomplished in the entire book.Don't get me wrong I'm a full blooded Star Wars fan, I've read just about every Star Wars book out there, including the other NJO books, but if you ask me you should save yourself the money and skip Onslaught on up through Conquest; you won't have missed anything by doing so.R.A. Salvador created a wonderful new galaxy to experiment and toy with, but the creativity his succesors included is of the tiniest proportions. Where's Zahn and Anderson when you really need them?Heed well my warning fellow Star Wars fan and remember, the Force will be with you..."
1,"Really, really bad","This book is awful. There were at LEAST 15 comments like: ""for more information on this topic, please read our book ....."" The fact is, I was reading THIS book, and the information was not there. The length of the book, apart from the appendix, is only 120 pages, and there are so many graphs and charts in here, that there isn't any real meat to this book.Maybe the authors knew what they were doing by telling us to go read their other books."
1,Sucks.,"Two major flaws.-Loudness setting controlled on the grenade, so the sleeper can just turn it down. Needs to be super glued to prevent this from happening.-You can just hold the handle down to silence it. The handle should come off after the pin, like a real grenade."
4,"Impressive, BUT.......","Pretty good game if you like the Olympics and have fast fingers. Not the best graphics in the world, (if you want those a must have is BUY BUY BUY MADDEN NFL 2001! BUY BUY BUY) and it's sort of sluggish. The CPU often cheats, but other then that it's a ALRIGHT game, not the best"
1,Poor job on netware 6,"I have the netware 5.1 book by Gaskin. That book was excellent which is why I bought this one, but this one [isn't].The text is too small (about font size 10)so unless you are 20 something, you will find reading very tiring. The screen shots are nearly illegible because they are so tiny.This book is too difficult to read for the beginning user and lacks the depth and detail needed by the advanced reader for use as a reference book. The examples on ConsoleOne and NWAdmin don't tell you where to find them or how to set them up or how to add snap-ins. It seems to be unncessarily detailed in some areas and missing vital information in other areas. It is definitely not the book for someone studying for the CNE 6 exam.In short, I regret buying the book."
2,"Good dialogue, undeveloped plot","I have read several of the Spenser books. This one started very promisingly, with witty dialogue and an interesting background. But about halfway through the book, the plot gave out. Spenser gets a lucky (too lucky) break when he spots a certain photograph, but the thread it offers to unravel the mystery is only minimally drawn out. The murdered woman remains a cipher to the end, her secrets barely unveiled. Too many secondary characters are mere page-filling red herrings (the sexy secretary, the sexy Southern detective, the overaggressive teenager). The murderer eventually just confesses his/her guilt to a passive Spenser. And, worst of all, at the last moment, to create the illusion of closure, the author invents a new, unrelated crime, both nameless and motivationless, so that Spenser can have one of the suspects arrested in a sham climax. A good premise gone nowhere."
4,A standard case for Spenser,"I have read several Robert Parker ""Spenser for Hire"" novels and have enjoyed all of them. This particular book was good, but seemed more formulaic than most. Some of his books are very interesting with unusual plot twists. Unfortunately, some of them, like this one, seem to be cranked out to a formula. Parker has been very successful in slowly defining Spenser's character and nuances. I felt this book drew on already established characteristics and went too far in the extreme with the climactic gunfight scene in the end. Still, the novel plays well into the series and is a fast paced book and a good read for true Spenser fans."
2,Disappointing,"This book has very little narrative summary to support the dialogue. As a result, it reads much like a movie script. Character development is weak and inconsistent, and the prose is almost juvenile in spots. It is something I would expect to see from a freshman college student, not a well-respected, seasoned author. I haven't read Parker's other books, so perhaps they are all written in this same over-simplistic style. It apparently works for some people, but not for me."
3,An elementary treatment.,This is a simple technique that the author tries to make complex. His earlier works are much more worthwhile.
5,"Very, very helpful","I have browsed this book in a bookstore and found it very amusing and interesting. Since then, the concept of mind-mapping has been nagging my mind for some time. So to console myself, I finally bought a copy and eversince, I have been using mind-mapping when jotting my lecture notes and scheduling. It took out the boredom of writing ""linearly"" and it made me discover the excitement of discovering my innate creative abilities-- besides the fact that this form of note-taking kept me awake and attentive during lectures. I think this concept of radiant thinking will be very helpful for students if learned at an early age."
1,Unoriginal but pretty,"OK, the guy is unoriginal. Mind maps have been around for centuries in one form or another, and the actual chap who originated the modern mind map is Dr Allan Collins quite a few years before Buzan. And, yes Buzan used lots of spurious claims and pseudoscience that misleads the learner into using mind maps where they are completely the wrong choice, and teaches people science that has been debunked for decades.But somebody's gotta do it!P.Jennings"
1,Trademarked Nonsense,"I found the mindmap method promising in writing, but useless in reality. I heard people raving about them, and believed them. I also believed the 99% untapped brain potential idea-until I engaged the brain. How did they come up with that spurious statistic?Anyway, before reading the book, the method confused me and my learning. Even after reading the book, the method still confused me and distracted my learning. Apparently the method is trademarked, and they are making money out of it. However, it seems to be less effective than normal visual methods that are already taught at school (drawing simple figures and annotating them).Full of hype and pseudoscience.Just get a good academic study method book instead!"
5,This is my 3rd and works great,"I use these in my basement. This is my 3rd unit. Holds 12 bins per rack. No issues at all with weight on it, and also anchors to the wall for support. A+++ in my book."
4,great,Installed perfectly into my 07 acura tsx. Runs nice a smooth and is such an easy maintenance item to do on an annual basis.
5,Cheaper than going to the dealer...,I bought both the air filter and the arm n hammer cabin filter. What a great deal with free shipping!
4,Make Your own Chewing Gum Kit,"If your child loves gum, this is fun! Pretty messy, but the end result is interesting. The flavor runs out fast, but fun to try."
1,An unfortunate gift,"My son received this as an Xmas gift. It was very difficult to mix, stuck to everything, and we ended up having to throw it away along with a cutting board, rolling pin, and 2 mixing utensils. ( even after soaking for 2 hours in HOT water and soap they were STILL sticky). I can't even imagine what would happen to one's teeth if they attempted to chew this goop. NOT RECOMMENDED."
5,Decent for a morning of fun...,Purchased this item as a gift for my eleven year old daughter not really hoping for much but was pleasantly surprised. It was a fun morning activity that didn't make nearly the mess I thought it would. I think it's about as decent as a simple kids' chewing gum kit could be. Price might be a bit high for the value but fun was had by all. The flavor lasts about as long as a stick of Juicy Fruit so don't expect much there. Overall happy with purchase and would consider getting again for a friend.
3,Clematis & Butterflies,"Since I am hopelessly untalented yet wanted to get my creative juices flowing I chose to take it one step at a time, so I decided to go for the paint by number kits. I poured over & pondered over which kit to buy since I wanted to make it easy on myself so I decided this Clematis & Butterfly painting kit would be the easiest for me to do. Well I am sure that this will turn out very nice but in the meantime I have to deal with painting in spaces that are so small its actually hard to keep track of them all let alone trying to keep them all separate. This is a nice kit & the finished product will be very pretty, but if I had known how difficult it was I would have passed this one up for an easier one for beginners.B. Jones"
5,Birds,"I love doing paint by number. It may not be totally creative, but it's relaxing, and I can't go wrong."
2,A gift,"We gave this paint by number to our Granddaughter for Christmas. She loves it. It is great for someone who will take the time to sit and paint. I wouldn't call it a ""toy"",it would break if ""played"" with. But handled as a painting it will give who ever finishes it something to be proud they finished. We bought her a frame to complete her project."
1,Missing Song,"No excuse other than laziness but this CD is missing the final single released by the band, Beggin' Me To Stay. Way to go Revola."
4,the classics just keep coming,"I was in 6th grade and 'All I Wanna Do' was a very popular song. Since then every couple years there was another sheryl crow song or two that I could jam to and then she was gone, and then she was back again. Always On Your Side has to be one of the most beautiful songs I've ever heard, I love the piano hook and melody, not many songs today even have that! Good is good is also a decent song. I think sheryl might be at her artistic and creative peak with this record and it's her most soothing one in my opinion."
4,Good stuff Sheryl!,"I really like this CD, Sheryl Crow truly has a style all her own. The one thing that dissappointed me with this CD was that the track ""Always on Your Side"" is just with Sheryl Crown, not the duet with Sting, which I love; so be advised!"
3,Sheryl is happy? I'm not.,"I really like Sheryl Crow and have all her albums. I can't help being a little disappointed with this album. It really isn't her normal perky and spunky style, which is fine, but to me a lot of the songs sound the same.It isn't an album that I'll be choosing when I want to listen to Sheryl."
5,Beautiful...,"...simply beautiful. Her voice, the lyrics, the melodies, the instrumentation, everything. Excellent use of strings. It's not a happy album, though. I'm OK with that, but I wonder if Sheryl knew, subconsciously, that her union with Lance was doomed."
4,a new side of sheryl,"Being a huge fan of her music since Tuesday Night Music club, it is interesting to hear Sheryl's new album; while some of the songs may seem to drag at the same tempo and moodly melody line, there is a new love and meaning in her lyrics. She moves away from the hippie-esq style to something more mature and beautiful sound. Different from everything else she's done, but still worth the purchase and overall an enjoyable album with a good 5 songs you will not be able to get out of your head."
2,Bland & Forgettable,"Eventhough Crow has never been an original, at least she was keeping the flame of rock n' roll alive. NOT ON THIS ALBUM! There are only 3 possibley 4 decent songs on this album. The rest of the album is totally forgettable. Most the songs sound like rejects from her other albums.Sometimes things don't get better with age."
5,Drop dead gorgeous!,"This is not heavy. This is not blues. This is not rock. It is maybe a bit country. A bit folk-rock. I don't really know how to categorise it. This is simply a compilation of drop dead beautiful songs, beautifully written and coming straight from the heart. This woman's voice is angelic! I love the honesty of this music. It is in the genre of Coldplay, and every bit as beautiful. I find this music so very uplifting and nurturing. And I do not tire of it upon repeated listenings. I can wholeheartedly recommend this. You can play this while entertainimg, or after the party. Or when you are alone and feeling a bit down. It makes you realise that someone else also knows the suffering that we call life. Just perfect. Bravo Sheryl Crow!"
1,Cheryl is a bad singer!,"The lead song, ""wildflower"" is sung by Cheryl way too high pitched. She can't hit the high notes and it sounds ear piercing. The guitar sounds better though. She should stick to the sort of bad girl, hanging out songs that made her a star. Mix it up with other singers and musicians too. That makes it more interesting and gets away from the same old same old lame, cry baby stuff. Try some power chords with a distortion pedal. I think metal may be good for Cheryl and some rap tunes. Get with the present Cheryl. Don't live in the past. Go ""bad girl"" and have some ""fun"" (your song)."
5,AMAZING PRODUCT,"Fast delivery, product as described, BUT you need to use the plunger together with the product to get the job done fast. My pipes were clogged HOPELESSLY. I did let the product sit overnight and used the plunger to pull out the buildup from the pipe wall, which clogged the drain even more. Was done in only 1 (!) treatment and did not take long at all. I repeated treatment the following day, just in case."
2,Enforcer does NOT work,"Followed the products instructions to the letter and it did not do anything for my slow running drain. Did not make the problem worse, it just did not do anything! Waste of money. I will try to find something else that will work that is septic safe"
5,Lots of fun :),"My sons were so excited when they received this. And remained enthralled with it for hours. They absolutely love the extruder, but started getting creative with the cutters as well. My four year old son literally sat on the floor for almost two hours completely content with this set."
4,Definitely Different,"Campbell takes a new spin on mental illness and chronicles a desperate mother trying to save her teenage daughter, but first she must battle her own demons. This is a definite page turner but not necessarily because there is a great plot. If anything, there are moments when the story line drags on and becomes redundant. However, kudos to the author for tackling mental illness from a fresh perspective and giving African American Fiction readers alternatives."
4,Interesting anecdotes,"This is a really interesting book and the author has found invaluable sources to paint a picture of tigers in the Malay world during this time period (1600-1950). I appreciate the fact that the book crosses the boundaries between anthropology and zoology at time, looking at indigenous beliefs and differences between different locations in the Malay world.At times, I felt the book went into too much detail to make it a light read. I would only recommend this book for serious students of Insular Southeast Asia or tigers. However, if you fit that category, I highly recommend this book."
2,Not worth reading,"I am a big fan of the author of this book Gerald G. Jampolsky and ACIM. However, I feel that this book written with his new life partner Diane Cirincione was too much filler and not enough substance. His earlier and what I consider classic work of his own ""coming of age"" Out Of Darkness into the light- A journey of inner healing is a much better read IMHO. I felt after reading this book that it was ""called in"" and didn't seem to offer much new except to promote his own Center and stories of others who have benefitted from their work. I would recommend you save your money and buy one of his other books instead- especially Out of Darkness."
5,Excellent diners' guidebook!,"This book has a permanent place on my bookshelf. I can see why New York enthusiasts swear by this guidebook. The book is arranged alphabetically, but diners can also locate restaurants divided by location, type of food, top ratings, most popular as well as by any special features. It also features the restaurants with the best New York Times reviews. Are you planning a trip to the Big Apple? I highly recommend this book for a fabulous meal in New York."
4,Not really a review,I too would love to find this disc. I wonder how Koch the recording company stay in business. They have some very good ideas about unique works and release recordings only to withdraw soon after when people start to find out about them - this is not the first time either. Perhaps a recording suggestion to another label like Chandos which have responded to recording suggestions by their customers before wont go unheaded this time particularly if several ask.
4,Pale Moon Rider,"Plot was very good and entertaining. The problem is that once you have red at least two of her books, the outcomes are very predictable. There are no surprise endings. The sex scenes are always the same in all of the books"
5,"Hilarious series from ""Shaun"" of the dead...","If you enjoyed ""Shaun of the Dead,"" you'll most likely love ""Spaced."" In my opinion, Simon Pegg can give Ricky Gervais (""The Office"") a run for his money. Comedy is all about timing, and the entire cast has it down cold. I downloaded a few episodes from Limewire, and I'm disappointed to see this title is unavailable from Amazon. Hopefully it will be available again soon."
4,Bought As A Present,"Not something I would purchase for myself, but my daughter-in-law wanted it so I ordered the set thru Amazon. I was worried shipping time would put it on my porch after Christmas because I ordered it only 8 days before the holidays. No problems. I received the set after only 3 days. Kudos to Amazon. My daughter-in-law was happy, so I was too!"
5,Tops,"Loved the whole thing. It was raw/unpolished, but had so much heart. I often find the low budget stuff to be more charming than the big budget stuff and it was definitely true with Spaced. They seemed to all enjoy each other and the fun came through. Had to watch each episode twice before I could watch the commentaries, just because I would still get caught up in the show. But the commentaries are fun and the whole package is so worth it!"
5,"***** if it were possible, it would be the best TV show from the UK","The show itself is amazing. Laying the groundwork for future works SHAUN OF THE DEAD and HOT FUZZ, this TV series has more depth and is probably one of the most Americanized britcoms ever made. With pop culture references and movie homages so ingrained, SPACED keeps rocking. Unlike their feature films, the writing here includes Jessica Hines (nee Stevenson) which adds a level of depth and even crass humor missing from the movies.The DVD's include an extensive documentary on the show, commentaries from the cast and crew, as well as newly recorded ones with the likes of Quentin Tarantino and Kevin Smith. There is even a special subtitle track called the HOMAGE METER that lets you know which movies and TV shows they are spoofing on screen.Dig this series. It's amazing."
3,Missed the mark,"I keep buying Siddons' books, hoping each will be better than the last I read. She's a talented writer but over-relies on eccentric characters and exaggerated situations for my taste. I keep books that I will want to reread in the future, those that affected me while reading them--Siddons' books inevitably end up in the ""donate to the library"" pile"
2,"Okay read w/interesting characters, but not her best.","Ever since Colony I have read all of ARS books. While I enjoyed getting to know Molly Redwine & her family, I couldn't help but shake my head at her choices. The prospect of caring for herself frightens her so that she feels she must take care of something else. Swans, okay. But two crazy, manipulative women and a nasty, withdrawn, bitter man? Sorry Anne, you missed it this time. Therapy may not be the socially acceptable way for Southern women, but Molly may have benefitted more from 6 months of sessions with a compassionate caring therapist than this bunch of people. For ARS at her best try Colony, Kings Oak or even Heartbreak Hotel."
3,ex southern belle becomes caretaker for bizarro bunch,"This author gives me more and more pleasure. the more she strays from her southern roots, the better she writes. In UP ISLAND, Molly Redwine is a middle aged, mother dominated Southern belle. (Mamma was purty, and Molly is purty too, but not as purty as Mamma was) However this belle gets dumped by her male menopause crazed husband. The other woman in this case is so wonderfully awful that readers must not miss her. If this is all not bad enough, Molly's favorite child has left the nest. What to do? Move up north to Martha's Vinyard and become a caretaker for a family far more Gothic than her own. Who says Southerners have a lock on weird, people should meet my family.Between crises, berserk swans (yes I said swans) and romance, UP ISLAND is a quick delightful beach read."
2,The author needs a better editor,"It has all been said here already. This is ""literature lite,"" but doesn't pretend to be otherwise. I have been listening to this book on tape in my 100 mile commute back and forth to work, and I noticed the constant use of two word that jar: literal (or literally), which the author uses inappropriately, and flame, as in cheeks flame. Come on, Siddons, you can do better than that. Use a thesaurus!"
2,rediculous,"I thought that this book was so boring and so hard to believe. There are so many better southern authors with a much greater and more compelling story to tell. As a New Englander, the Vineyard was not captured as she should be. It seemed that the author was ""name dropping"" all the places she has been on the Vineyard and trying to show off her limited knowledge. I was very disappointed in the novel and can be sure not to waste my time on any others by this author."
3,Classic Siddons!,"The novel was classic Siddons. She is her usual self in developing characters that you both align with and question their behavior at the same time. As always, Siddons makes you contemplate and examine yourself in relation to her characters in this story."
5,The True Picture Of Moi,"Andew Morton is a foreign journalist who has come to realize Moi's role in Kenya.The only true patriotic Kenyan I know is president Moi.A man who has tried to keep Kenya united despite the economic and tribal hardships.Many who pose to lead Kenya have not shown any national interests outside being president for the sake of it.Andrew has truely written of who Moi is and what Kenya leadership entails .Many in the West don,t exactly understand the intricacies of Kenyan cultures and behaviours.This book will stand the tests of history.It is a great book about a great leader.ThanksZeberio Amwoma[Minnesota]"
1,Not worth the paper its printed on...,"I made the mistake of reading this book and I was so irritated with it I had to throw it away. I would be embarrassed to have this on my bookshelf. The characters were one-dimensional, the plot was overly simplistic, and the relationship between Lydia and Lu Shan just plain wierd. Don't waste your time."
4,Interesting read,"I've never read about yin and yang before, and I'll all for the slave scenarios. Lydia is a strong willed English woman who journeys to Shanghai to surprise her fiance, when she's abducted and sold into slavery. Ru Shan is in for quite a shock when he discovers the woman he enslaved has actually enslaved his spirit, and eventually his heart. Interesting and original!"
5,Spa product at home,"I went to a spa to get the exfoliation treatment. THIS was it! All they did was rub a creamy cleanser on me, used this towel, rinsed me off, and then massaged oil into my skin. I tipped the therapist extra to let me keep the towel since they used a new one for each customer. Searched online for Salux and got here. Have ordered more for friends and everyone loves it. Because is lathers so nicely it never feels too rough so I feel comfortable using it many times a week. In the winter it's every day."
5,Makes your skin very soft,"After just one use I noticed the difference in my skin. I used to have acne on my back and chest, and this washcloth has irradicated the problem. I would strongly recommend this as an excellent way to exfoliate the entire body."
3,Female security expert has men at her feet.,"Delaney Wescott, former lawyer and FBI agent, now runs her own private security firm. She is hired by a famous actor, Lucas Wayne, to guard him from a former lover who has threatened his life. Delaney is tall, dark, beautiful and strong,and three men in the story can't resist her. The actor, of course, because she is off limits. Her former lover, who was married, and just happens to live in the town where Lucas Wayne has his house. And her long suffering partner, who has loved her for years, waiting for her to get over her married lover. The action is all at the end, and aside from a few small plot twists there isn't much passion in either her present or her past for the reader to sink into. It's a light summer read at best. And I'll bet you can guess who she ends up with.."
4,Scott Adams is simply fabulous. Great Stuff !!,"This is the first Dilbert book i read and it was way beyond my expectations. Almost every chapter made me say to myself ""Hey! This happens at my office too!"". Its worth every cent I paid for it. I am now planning to buy all other Dilbert books."
5,"So Uncanningly Accurate, It's Scary!!!","From the Bible to Nostradamus to Jean Dixon to the Bankrupt Psychic Hotline, people have tried to predict what the future will hold. Scott Adams is the perfect soothesayer who doesn't try to soothe your ego. Extrapolating on current trends, he shows how the future will be shaped by a few humans with a modicum of intellegence even while being held back by the morons in high places.This book is definately a keeper. I haven't seen this type of science fiction extrapolation since Asimov created psycho-history and Heinlein devised the future history!Read about the future NOW!!! Before it becomes history!"
4,All That Gliters,"This book was good, but not my favorite out of the books. I think kara was way to snobby and spoiled in this one. BUT good that she found a jewel!"
3,Not the greatest book in the series,"Ok. I don't mean to be rude but this book really was not good. I mean the book was good is just I don't like Kara and I find she is way, way, way to jealous of her friends and selfish not to mention spoiled. Kara wishes she can have a jewel and later she finds one but there are these weird creatures who stalks her. At the end it's good but Kara can act such a queen."
1,Crap,"This album is crap, the worst by Hammerfall till date. It's a classical ""Spinal Tap"", but with one worsening factor: it almost almost sounds as pop metal. IRgh!"
3,Spinal Tap,"This band became a joke. I enjoyed their previous albums, mainly Legacy Of Kings. So, it came as a surprise the extreme silliness of this album, who reached an all time low in lyrics department.Musically, if they survive this album, they will go one forever. It is almost pop metal, amazing, a rough departure from their previous style. Check the example below to get a glimpse of the lyrics ""quality"" here...""HEARTS ON FIRE, HEARTS ON FIREBURNING, BURNING WITH DESIRE""..... Yes, that's it. And repeat and repeat..."
2,Still singing about the Templars?,"Please, when will this Spinal Tap heavy metal band stop writing about the Templars, or the Crusaders or whatever? I have the first three albums and I got fed up with that and, also, with the double-kick drums that plagues all most of their songs.I also think it's funny when a reviewer says :""..if you like Iron Maiden or Judas Priest. you'll like this album..."" Well, if I want to hear Maiden, I will listen to my Maiden records, not HammerFall!"
3,I know the reason...,"I think I know the reason many of the reviewers are a little bit dissapointed with the new HammerFall album. Altough I consider it a very good album, somehow some of the spark is missing. The reason is simple: producer.For the first time, HammerFall worked with Charlie Bauerfeind. THis guy produced literally DOZENS of power metal bands from Europe. So, when HammerFall hired his service, they automatically lost a lot of their original and particularly recognizable sound. Simple as that. That's why we find some signs of pop metal and even glam here..."
5,planet earth/blue planet,This is a visually stunning and extremely engaging piece of filming.Very informative and able to keep the attention of young viewers as well as the interest of the adults. Definately recommend to anyone.
1,DO NOT BUY FROM APYUNITED,"I tried to google ""apyunited"". I was unsuccesful. They didn't even include a ""return to sender"" sticker. 6 out of 10 DVDs were scuffed or had glue on them. Now I'm stuck with a 10 disc DVD set that might become a ""fruit cake substitute gift"" for Christmas. Do yourself a favor andDO NOT BUY FROM APYUNITED."
3,Used planet earth and Blue Seas of Life,I bought this for office entertainment. Most good but one of the DVDs skips. I suppose that is why it is better to buy new.
4,Awesome gift,"This DVD set is a must have for anyone who got to see this on TV when it first aired. Now you can rewind and pay more attention to what you may have missed. Great quality and not a bad price. Gave it to my dad, and he was VERY happy!"
1,BEWARE,I too fell victim to the one or two discs that do not play. I purchased the complete series brand new and paid $88! Since it took my father too long to view his Christmas present there is no returning it as the return window expired.
2,VERY disappointed with Breaking the Press,"I gave this movie 2 stars because I bought it mainly so my boys (ages 8,7,&,4) would have a good basketball movie to watch. The cover says ""if you like Facing the Giants then you will love Breaking the Press"", NOT TRUE, by the end of the movie, (which we reached rather quickly with fast-forwarding parts), my whole family decided it was a waste of time. The parts we fast-forwarded were parts where there were girls that were hardly dressed in bikinis, Josh & his girlfriend were heavily making out, these are things I don't care to see in a ""Christian"" movie and I certainly don't want my boys to see. Although the story line is good the moral rating is NOT. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone."
3,cover one of your eyes and face the mirror,"The first chapter is quite good, but he forgot to tell his readers that you needed a bridge to be one with God. ""I am the way and the light......"", said Jesus. And you have to correlate John 9:4-5 and Luke 6:39-40. Rumi gave a hint when he said that without the compassion of Shamis-i-Tabriz, he would not become one with the Ocean. Of course, he has to pierce the moon first before he experience the Ocean. I am not claiming anything. I am just clarifying some things for futuretravellers, whatever that means to persons who might encounter my small contribution. Mr. Dyer seemed to simplify anything. It is really simple but it is not that simple. Thank you."
5,Awesome!,"Manifest Your Destiny encourages you to step into your own PLACE OF POWER. It encourages you to do so and lets you know that it is your spiritual right to do so. Furthermore, this book gives you the techniques and information necessary for you to live your life in authentic power. ""Never ever a victim "" is the consciousness that grows out of reading and applying the information in this book. Truly awesome! Peace and love!"
5,i love anthony's xanth series!!!!,"this is definitely one of the best xanth novels yet. i have been collecting his works and they are fabulous. i especially like all the cute,sexy things that the characters say and the author's approach to sex and things that relate to it. wonderful book!!!!"
1,The One That Turned Me Away,"I have to admit, that I was suprised to see that this book got such a high rating, as it was the one in the series that pushed me away from Xanth. I finished it and was overcome by a sense of pointlessness in reading these books that must have begun with ""Demons Don't Dream."" The older books are much better, when the author actually had a story to tell, it seems unfortunate that now Anthony spends his time with Xanth in attempts to fill it with what he thinks are clever puns to appease the fans who send in their ideas, when really in my opinion, the puns are just plain annoying. I suggest Anthony stops cranking out Xanth books so quickly, and instead tries to think of some interesting stories to tell, although I have to say, there are signs of improvment with the most recent books, ""Faun and Games,"" for example."
1,worst vacuum ever!,"after just 1 and a half months this vacuum completely stopped working. After following care instructions, there was still no suction & it blew whatever I was trying to vacuum up all over the floor. Do not purchase this product!"
1,DON'T BUY IT,"This vaccuum cleaner was 300. from can tire where i purchased it. it is a worthless, heavy piece of garbage that went through 8 belts in 1 week, it was not hard used. I returned the first one, can tire replaced it immediately, second one, same thing. After 1 month, twice a week vaccums it just stopped working. Don't waste your money, this is the most irritating machine ever, and it wouldn't be a good deal if it were free. I have never reviewed a product before, but this one is so bad, i thought i would try to spare others my grief."
4,"So Far, So Good","This vacuum is a great value in that it is very similar in design to the Dyson line of vacs, but costs less than half the price. Got my unit at Bed, Bath, and Beyond, usually a good store to deal with. As others have indicated, the chamber fills quickly, and the moisture takes longer than 24 hours to dissipate after you clean it. Does a great job of getting stuff off the carpet that my old Kenmore couldn't get. What's interesting is that the March 2007 Consumer Reports rated the Kenmore higher than the Dyson, which doesn't make sense to me. Go figure."
2,Shawls and Scarves,It is a very nice book but not exactly what I had thought when I purchased it. I would have liked to have seen a written review on it before I purchased. It has too many exotic things for my taste.
4,Looking forward to getting this book,"Absolutely one of the best article collections I have come across in months. I'm writting my MSc thesis right now, and I'm definitely looking forward to reading this book."
5,Excellent Tasting Coffee Pods,Can't find product available for purchase! Did they stop mfg. this product? How and when will I be able to purchase product?
4,Good Coffee,I bought this brand of coffee because the Gala brand was not available. The coffee is good but cost more than the Gala brand. You get 2 more pods per bag with Gala for about the same money. If I could get the Gala brand I would order it over the Millstone just for price alone.
2,"Lousy software, impossible to connect to on a Mac","This isn't really the fault of the drive itself, but the Maxtor ""Easy Manage"" software is awful! If the drive goes to sleep or is disconnected from the computer for whatever reason, I have to turn the drive off and on multiple times to get the software to recognize that it's there. I open the Easy Manage tool and it doesn't even attempt to find the drive. I have not figured out how else to mount it on my OS X machine or how to get the drive to wake up other than powering it down or unplugging the network cable. There seem to be no options to set the sleep time, or anything like that. Unfortunately I already have my data on it and think it's past the return date."
2,Useless as a Media Server,"That's a shame, because that's what I bought it for. I tried to team it with a Netgear EVA700, but it was a frustrating and expensive experiment. I've given it 2 stars purely in the hope that the backup functionality is a lot better than the media server, or even works."
5,"Valuable For International Negotiations, Too","As a consultant in International and Cross-Cultural Management, I found this book particularly valuable. That's because it not only is a great and comprehensive compendium on effective negotiating (as others already pointed out), but it also covers techniques negotiators may be less likely to find used in the US but are likely to run into when abroad. Examples are extreme openings, time pressure, large negotiation teams, and so on. This makes the book very valuable in preparing for overseas negotiation, for instance in Asia."
4,Highly recommended,I found this book to be full of wonderful ideas (too bad I had already learned most of them the hard way :-). This is a wonderful reference for the professional stage manager but can also be easily adapted for community or college theatre as well.
3,"""Run Little Linda""","What about ""Run Little Linda"",a good rocker on reprise 1963????????? its not an complete anthology if u are missing songs!!!"
2,average to poor,"Only purchased because it was required for class, not very interesting and definitely does not make you want to read more of it. Very dry material not very entertaining. Do not purchase unless required for class."
1,Only bought because school required it.,"The only reason to buy this book is if it is required. The author is very demeaning to anyone without a BSN. Many of the comparisons between ADN/Diploma Nurses and BSN's say the same thing but in different, sometimes conflicting, ways. The language is complex, using too many ""buzz"" words. For a ""scholarly"" work, there are too many grammatical errors. This does not inspire learning or confidence in the author."
3,They are sold as subwoofers but are not,"Even tough the description says that they're subwoofers, they are not. The frequency response is not of a subwoofer but they do sound great with a 50w per channel amp. This work ok if you use a cabinet with a powered subwoofer as a reinforcement. 3 stars because of the misleading label of ""subwoofer"""
4,A terrific overview of American tax history.,"Brownlee gives a great overview of America's taxation history. The book is a fairly fast read and gives the reader a good historical framework without a multitude of minutia. It also seems to be relatively free from bias, although Brownlee evidently does not adore FDR..."
3,Did not solve the purpose,"I desperately wanted a posture corrector and was waiting for this. but it did not help as there might be a size issue or some technical issue. because the size is perfect from the waist but it doesnt have enough welcrow at the shoulders to make it tight.if the welcrow was little bit more, my shoulders would have got the shape as well. thus, i am disappointed. also, i cant even exchange it as the product is in India. Amazon should have some special options for people outside US."
5,Mariani Tropical medley,Product arrived within a week. I had settled for another brand since I couldn't find this one in our local stores. I was thrilled to taste it again and enjoy the great variety of fruits included. Very satisfied with my purchase.
4,"Good, but expensive","I really enojy this pillow and I think it is defaintely necessary for my pregnancy. But I do think it was a gamble for me to spend so much money on a pillow. Luckily it defaintely helps me sleep better and helps my back pain too. So, if someone you know has one you can test out first to make sure that it's right for you, then it would be worth it, otherwise you could have a pillow that is essential for you to sleep good, or just a very expensive funny shaped pillow."
2,Very good read!,"A positive, uplifting, encouraging look at the world of international sports and its impact on the human spirit."
1,1 star is way too many,"Just opened the box, and 10 minutes later it goes back.This player is dreadful. Quality of picture is so-so, could've been much more better. But more importantly: this piece of junk does not have a search capability, meaning that wherever you left off, you can't search/GOTO to the place where you had stopped! You can only scroll! So, let's suppose you have a 2 hour mpeg-4 movie, and you stopped at 90 minutes. It will take you 15-20 minutes just to get to that place again. It is simply ridiculous. I guess, there is no limit to wisdom, or its absense.Avoid at all cost, plus cutomer/tech support is almost non-existant."
5,Anyone would love this inspirational book.,"One of my grandchildren gave me this book for my birthday and I just fell in love with it. It is a small book and very hard to put down. I bought it for my ""secret pal"" in our quilting club. Betty"
1,Dull dull dull on arrival...,"Glad I found these at a better price than local stores. Unfortunately they were DULL from the first shave. I tried two blades from one package and one blade from the other 5-pack with the same results, a very rough, scratchy shave. Not at all like Mach3 blades purchased from local stores. I'm not sure what the problem is but I'd be very apprehensive about purchasing !! Usually new blades are very sharp and give a smooth shave, not these !"
1,DO NOT BUY!!!!!,"DO NOT ORDER THIS ITEM!!!!! EVER!!! Not only did the razors not shave my legs, it took a ""minimum"" of four runs!!!Do you know what that does to legs? These were obviously refurbished razors and repackaged. DO NOT BUY THESE!!! PLEASE!!! You will end up with razor rash; they are not sharp at all, and will only bring misery. Sadly, I was trying to save money, but it's not worth it. DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM!!!! I ended up buying replacements in the grocery store, but at least I had a clean shave. DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM!!! YOU WILL REGRET IT!!! THEY ARE ""REFURBISHED BLADES OR FAKES!!!!"". THE RASH FOR WEEKS IS NOT WORTH IT!!!"
1,WILL NOT PLAY DVD+R DISCS!!!!,"Bought this because my ancient Playstation-2 sometimes (not always) hits a snag with DVD+R.Could not believe it when this unit, advertised (even on the box) said it will play DVD+R plus everything else. Tried the discs on other players and they played (even picky PS2). Then read others had the same problem, so back this thing goes.It is TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE for a new unit in 2006 to lack this ability. Even crusty old players are worth more than this."
4,Nice item,"I bought these for my grandson for x-mas...They are made really nice and sound very nice...the kids liked them alot...But now in Feb,I really dont see them play with them much at all...But was impressed with the set of bongos..."
4,Hawaiian - Billy Vaughn style,"For those who enjoy the Billy Vaughn well-known twin saxophone syle, this is a beautiful recording, very much in keeping with his other releases. Sweet, dancable big-band Hawaiian songs."
5,Classic,"Great biography of a great man. If you want to read about someone to set a standard to how to live your life, read this book. I like how the author covered his entire life both civilian and military. Though Gettysburg made him famous, Chamberlain contributed to alot more to the society he live in. This will stay on my bookshelf as a lifetime read."
4,Love this crib!,"the only reason it gets 4 stars, and not 5, is because it doesn't have a guardrail for a toddler bed, and it doesn't come with the bed rails for the full bed conversion. But both of those things you know beforehand.I love the color. There are a few minor packaging nicks in the finish, but the finish is beautiful, and wood is solid, and the crib took about 20 minutes to put together. I love that the instructions are on the mattress slab, so you'll never lose them. I also love that the front and back edges round out, so they are harder for baby to get his mouth on. I'll still need plastic guards for the sides.I love, love, love this crib. Can't wait for my LO to use it in October!"
3,An Australian's look at Asia,"This is a good dark book. Read it and you will see bogey men around every corner in Asia. I found the guidelines for foreign investors particularly offensive -- certainly stupid. In my opinion, the book ignored the great opportunities in Asia and did a poor job of indicating strategies that businesses may follow. Buy this book for an Australian's look at Asia -- but for a more balanced view, by people who have actually worked there, I recommend ""New Asian Emperors: the Overseas Chinese, their Strategies and Competitive Advantages"" by George Haley et al."
2,Not much help for investors,"I bought this book because I thought it would help me to understand how to do business in Asia. Instead, I found many ""newsy"" stories of ""those corrupt Asians"" -- not particularly helpful in making decisions there or working with people there. Yes, Asia is corrupt; but then, so is Australia or the USA. Probably Asia is more corrupt in some respects -- but this is not the defining mode for seeing business relationships there. I enjoyed reading this book because it does read like a novel. But, I much prefered George Haley's ""New Asian Emperors: the Overseas Chinese, their Strategies and Competitive Advantages"" as an aid to understanding business and relationships and this is the book that I am recommending my company read. Backman's book too often stoops to being sensational and ""scoopy"" and sometimes just appears plain racist and offensive."
1,Surprizingly bad,I expected a more reasoned and better-researched book from the author who has written on Asia before. This book sounds like it comes from yet another opportunistic Australian writing on Asia -- which I hope the author is not!
3,Greatest Rock Band Ever,"Greatest Rock Band Ever, or so they say at the show. This is a band that is better appreciated live. The power of Rock doesn't quite come thru without the band playing in front of you, standing in a dark bar, holding a cold drink in hand.... It's a great band, but you really need to see them live, do it today."
5,A wealth of innovative ideas making it perfect for all parent/child camping adventures,"Very highly recommended reading for all parents wishing to instill an appreciation of the out-of-doors in their children, Camping With Kids: The Complete Guide To Car, Tent, And RV Camping by Goldie Gendler Silverman is an informative commentary and compendium of valued and helpful tips for parents hoping to indulge their children in an outdoor camping expedition. Introducing dozens of concepts and ideas for a fun and active time camping, Camping With Kids provides readers with expert advice, quick quizzes for decisive camping particulars, helping hands for getting kids involved, imaginary camping for preparation, and checklists for assistance in organization.

3,Can't find right size bulb,Bought 4 (5 inch)of these last week. Par30 bulbs stick out of fixture by an inch. Not sure if the cannister is the problem or not but need some help......
5,great,"although i dont use this hitch too much it works good, especially with the adjustable settings it helps it fit almost all vehicles to trailers"
3,A starting point for dialog,"Robinson presents a counterblast to those who regard the LDS church as non-Christian. To be fair, he gives little weight to the polemic that occasionally issues from the Mormon church itself, marking a very clear demarcation between its own legitimacy as distinct from the illegitimacy of all other churches. Without addressing this issue his case is substantially weakened.I found the section on the creation of the Bible canon to be of real interest. Robinson makes telling points about the diversity of the canon of scripture, and speaks with a directness only possible for one outside the Protestant mainstream.This is a work of polemic, written with some passion. As a work of polemic it shares the weaknesses of all such works. However, if it is seen as a starting point for genuine dialog, reflection and debate, then it has a great deal to offer, particularly to those of us who are non-members seeking greater understanding of the LDS church."
2,"First half: 4-stars, 2nd half: 1-star","In a nutshell, the book is a real page turner for the first half, which follows the actual events that took place on the island.THEN, we go into trial mode and the fun ends. Author may as well repeat ""I am gods gift to the legal system"" for a few hundred pages followed by ""the end"".Just a big ego-driven tirade. I could not finish the book."
4,"Great Start, Slow Finish","This is a fascinating story of murder on a deserted island. The first half of the book is a riveting, well-developed account of two couples seeking paradise and finding disaster. Descriptions are thorough, and character development is excellent. However the latter-half of the book dealing with the trial is long-winded and somewhat annoying. Bugliosi's entire 5-hour closing argument fills page after tedious page, and I found myself simply skimming over the latter 1/4 if the book. Legal buffs and lawyers will enjoy it, the rest of us will be content to indulge in the characters, the island and the crime, and then simply browse through the ending."
1,"I don't offend easily, but this book did it.","The first half of the book is outstanding - a compelling and descriptive account of the circumstances leading up to the crime, and the investigation. Then, sadly, the book devolves into Bugliosi writing himself a love letter about how brilliantly he got an obviously guilty woman acquitted. I understand that as a defense attorney, that's his job. But what an insult to the family of the victims to then profit further and proclaim his genius in print. I found it offensive enough that I almost didn't finish, and out of thousands of books I've read, I can count the number I didn't finish on one hand. Okay, Vince, we know you're famous - you prosecuted the Manson family - a group of disorganized idiots that confessed. Not exactly a Clarence Darrow moment. At least he's trying to redeem himself by publicly accusing W of murder for lying to get us into the Iraq mess."
4,Starts Strong,"The start of the book is riveting. I really enjoy reading about the mystery on the island. I was totally engrossed in it. Then the trial starts... Now I have no doubt that Bugliosi is an excellent lawyer, but his long dawn out trial script is a really though read. It worked in Helter Skelter a lot better then here. But I found both books sort of dragged. But this book is worth getting just for the beginning."
4,Interesting read,I saw the mini series based on this book years ago. I was always interested in finding out what really happened. Will never know what really happened on the island but the book did keep my interest.
3,Re-mastered in 1990/92,"Even though this set contains superb performances of all the symphonies and the piano concertos, I do NOT recommend that anyone purchase it, if they have the previously released Sony Essential Classics issues. This French released set (made in Austria in the year 2000) is virtually the same as both the 1990/92 series (pressed in USA) and the more recent Essential Classics issues (made in Austria). Each disc has the exact same SBK catalog number as the original early 1990's individual releases.The recordings of the symphonies are relatively smooth and spacious, whereas the piano concerto recordings reveal some audible strain during orchestral tuttis. Yet even these early 1990's remixes are an audible improvement over the the very first 1980's CD releases."
2,Beethoven: The 9 Incomplete Symphonies...,"I purchased the Szell-directed Beethoven Nine Symphonies because I had listened to them while in college years ago. At that time, they were recorded on 33.3 long-playing vinyl and over the years, deteriorated. Being very familiar with the nine symphonies, and being especially fond of the Szell-directed Cleveland Orchestra, I purchased the box set as described in the title. I was dismayed that during the ends of several movements, the recording suddenly shifted to the next without finishing the previous, thereby truncating my enjoyment of some of the most dramatic music ever composed and performed. I would not recommed this box set to anyone who would like to hear the complete nine symphonies, but gave it two stars because at this stage of my life, something is better than nothing."
3,"Great book, bad kindle translation","I purchased this book after reading the other reviews, and I was not disappointed.It has GREAT content. Now the annoying part.Obviously a robot without a spell checker OCR'd the book and make a kindle version, and then the author or amazon never proofed it. Every single page has words with numbers in place of letters and/or funky random spaces in the middle of words, words are even broken across line breaks.Also NO browsable table of contents, chapters, or organization of any kind, so you would probably be better of with the paper edition if you are going to be referring back to the book."
1,"Thin gruel, way overpromised","Far from being a comprehensive tour of science-oriented travels, this is simply a cursory, spotty travelogue.The bits and pieces are fine and fun, but hardly worthyof a booklength treatment. This would have made a fine magazine article."
5,First Rate Historical Fiction,"This author really knows how to tell a story. Set in early 1860s Japan, a young American diplomat is swiftly caught-up in conflict between the Shogun and some rebellious warlords. There are great battle scenes, an interesting Japanese heroine, and a nice transition to the American Civil War. My only complaint was that this was a novella, not a full-length novel. However, the story is strong enough to overcome this single drawback. I look forward to reading more by this talented author."
4,Great pocket organizer-checkbook cover,"Very nice, soft leather checkbook cover with many card slots and pockets to organize cards, checks, ID and money."
5,LOVE THIS CAMI,"I wear this cami EVERY DAY from sun up to sun up again! I play in it, work in it, and sleep in it. I LOVE IT! I have it in every color they make and even a few variations, with lace, with out lace, with overlay, etc. I can't get enough of these cami's! They are very slimming. Stay tucked into my pants and jeans and PJ bottoms. EXTREMELY comfy. I don't wear a bra with them, the provide plenty of coverage and support and I am a size 36 C. I have recently had shoulder surgery and a bra strap would cut into my surgery site and absolutely KILL me - this is soft and almost invisible feeling. Does not hurt me at all!"
3,Get a size smaller!!,"This product didn't give the slimming effect I was looking for, but I definatly recommend buying it a size smaller than what you normally wear. Mine was too big so it obviously didn't work like it was made too. I would definatly try it agian in a smaller size tho."
1,Waste of money,"I am a 5'9"" size 4, so although I am slim to begin with, I have a lot of skin that never returned after my pregnancies. I bought a small (the smallest they make) to try and control all the skin and it is WAY too big. Not to mention that, as another reviewer stated, it is too short for someone my height... rides up all the time. Waste of money, in my opinion."
5,Love this!!,Although petite I am very self-concious about being hippy. I bought the camisole and a strapless tube-tank version to smooth my hips under certain tops & wedding/party dresses. They are great!
2,Layer Styles and How to Use Them,"That should have been the name of this book which is basically is nothing more than a set of layer styles and a brief description on how to use them. While some of the styles are nice and do enhance photos the overall package is not worth it. There are plenty of free style palettes out on the web which can do a lot of the same things as this pakage. If perhaps this CD/book combo came with something that absolutely blew your socks off, I would say it was worth it but, the fact is, it doesn't."
3,Law and Promise,"At first read, this is a powerful and interesting book. I've only recently begun exploring the writers of this genre (more experience with eastern thought), and I specifically began with Neville and Joel Goldsmith. I have to say that I believe Mr. Goldsmith's work reflects perhaps a higher level of spiritual aspiration and awakening, whereas Neville appears to focus more on manipulating the physical realm. Don't get me wrong, it's strong stuff...but still a bit of ego gratification muddying the water maybe. Of course that's just my take today."
1,not as advertised,Bought it cuz it was cheap - you know the old saying! So true in this case. MIne doesn't even play mp3 disks and is very fussy about burned DVDs. Spend a bit more & get something that works!
1,Staty away - designed to last 3 1/2 months,"I looked for an expensive replacement DVD player. Never really knew the right questions to ask - but I've learned the hard way. This DVD Player comes with a 3 month guaratee, so guess what happened after 3 1/2 months? After a brief phone call to Magnavox, it was very easy for them to politely tell me to take a hike - their interest in their product was over after 90 days, and it was now the 105th day. Be advised - find out about guarantees before you purchase, and find out if the Manufacturer stands behind their Product in any way, shape or form. Cheap can be expensive!"
3,A crazy plot--but fun,"A good story mixing American and British personalities. The romance developes as many other romance novels, but the storyline is much different.......who heard of moving a castle......across an ocean, no less! There is also a mystery and ghosts. Enjoyable."
4,good product,"Well, this was my first experience using a compression dress sock. It only helped my leg pain up to a certain level.This product is good, but the hard part comes when you are trying to take off the socks!"
2,Too Compressed?,"Even tho the size of these compression socks were larger than my father's actual foot size, he could not get them on. Maybe his feet were too swollen, but I thought these socks were for this condition."
5,Used You Say?!,"I purchsed the first of these ""reconditioned"" systems for my dad. So far it has lasted over four months and still going strong. The sound quality is very nice and is easy to use.The second one I purchased for myself. I enjoy the ease of use, as it comes with a remote control. I have had no problems with it at all. So far it is working properly and has great sound quality. I mainly play CD's, but it also plays tapes.I have somewhat changed my views on purchasing ""reconditioned"" products."
4,We learned together as a team.,The handbook was helpful and easy to understand. The software was somewhat hard to understand. It would have been helpful to know what the rating system was before we started. Also more information on how to forecast sales might be helpful. I learned from the experience how to work together to accomplish a task. I would recommond this book to anyone in business.
1,This book has problems,"I used this book in my strategies course at Hannibal-LaGrange College. I do not like this book, it gives very general instructions, it does not give complete thoughts of what the students are to do. For example, we are to sell two different products, but we do not know what the two products are, this is unrealstic in the business world. I hope that there are other learning tools out there for the students to use, that are more realistic."
2,Pretty bad simulation,"I found that this book only gave the basic information necessary to run the program. The information it provided was vague, and almost pointless. If there is a problem that is encounter in the program, you cannot go to the book to find out how to solve it. The simulation could use a more realistic approach. It provides no definite information as to what you are selling or who your target audience is."
2,A Learing Experience,"I am a senior business major at Hannibal LaGrange College. Threshold Competitor: A Management Simulation is a learing experience. I think that there are too many things that is controlled by the choice of the computer. I think that there needs to be a student hotline, that students can call with questions. While working on my company I had lots of questions and really on one to answer them. I also think that there are many other things that the computer does not take in to consideration when figuring sales for a company. I think that Thersold is a educational software program, but I think there are too many choices the computer makes for you. I dont think that Thersold should be used to determine a large portion of a students grade"
5,Exactly what I needed,"Who ever thought they'd need a strip outlet in their car? But with the kid's DVD player, the cell phone charger, and the radar detector all going at once, this 4-way socket was exactly what I needed. No more unplugging this to plug in that. They all stay plugged in, and I just unplug the whole thing from the main outlet when I turn off the car to make sure nothing drains the battery. And the price is right too! Pick one up and save yourself some hassle."
1,You're lucky if it breaks during the return window,"Stopped working after only 2 months of use, and I can't return it because the 30 day return window has passed. Worst ten bucks I ever spent."
3,I am still using it. Design flaw on the first outlet.,"I bought this to expand the charging capacity on my boat. It works well with the exception of the first outlet. Seems they have it set up to work with cigarette lighters and if you plug a regular charger into the outlet and turn it you can short the 12 volt contact to the ground of the plug, blowing your fuse. Not good.I like how it came with retractable mounting tabs and screws. I mounted it on the side of a cabinet out of the way and use it to run a 12v battery monitor, charge 2 cell phones and run my laptop all at the same time.Very nice."
4,Good product.,So far it worked great. I put this in my vw camper to charge multiple cellphones and my tablet. Haven't had any problems or issues.
5,great purchase from demanding buyer,"I bought this socket multiplyer and a second one thinking one would be bad, well now I will always look for ""Wagon"" products when I have any automotive or electrical needs and I have been an electrician for 30 yrs working for intel chip mfg plants and Los Alamos weaponds Labs thanks Wagon for products I can count on I only wished Wagon would of had this with a usb port"
3,Wagan 4-Way 12V Automotive Socket Extender,This four-way socket is misleading you really only have three sockets the other is for a cigarette lighter and can't really be used for anything else.The wire is heavy enough to carry the current I use it for two seat heaters and a GPS.So you cannot charge your iPhone with the other three sockets used.
1,Junk - absolutely do not purchase!,I bought this because I was going on a road trip and needed the extra ports for my electronic items. I plugged it in to my cigar lighter and the unit lit up. So then I removed and tried to plug it in one more time to be certain. I put back into the cigar lighter (nothing plugged in yet) and it blew the twenty amp fuse in my car -- not the fuse it comes with internally.I had to stop on my trip to get a fuse and have it replaced.The vehicle is a 2004 model.DON'T BUY!
2,Wagan 4-Way 12V Automotive Socket Extender,"Just got this one. I opened it to cut off the LED, I found out the assembly of this unit was so poor.The connections of two wires (+,- cables) were almost broken. I had to use soldering iron to solder thewires. Wish they should have inspection before shipping to consumers. Finally, I saw the label ""Made From China "" ... It told me every thing.Plus, they Do Not have the Cigarette Lighter as shown on the photo. Be ware of this.Have not use it yet. Will post more when I find good or bad.T"
3,HUGE!!!,"Just got this and haven't used it yet, but that's mostly because I have to figure out a way to fit this thing into my car! The picture is deceiving because this thing is huge!"
3,4-way socket,I was only checking this out and decided not to buy it. Have one similar so it wouldn't be needed.
3,Artificial Aquarium,This video was first viewed at my doctor's office. It is very calming and interesting at the same time. The colors are brilliant.
3,Power vent thermostate,The product was fine but the delivery was slow. I had to buy a thermostat locally to replace my vent motor which I received within two days. It took over a week to get the thermostat. I did return it and received a refund. It did cost me the return postage.
1,Title is misleading. This is not a self-help book.,"This book is aimed towards people who are emotionally obsessed with relationships and fantasizing about them. However, it does not provide ANY help whatsoever in how to overcome this illness. Rather, it explains in an ostensibly scientific manner how these people come about their obsessions and lead their miserable lives. This book aims to analyze a demographic that needs exactly the opposite: listening, love and attention. When it doesn't preach, it lists many a suggestion to compensate for the superficiality of its contents and the stark fact that this author can't help you. In my opinion more than half of the book is written in bullet points, in a very concise and impatient way.I rummaged it for interesting details, and when I couldn't find any, I just gave it to the local library. I wish I hadn't bought it."
1,Did Yours Work ???,The threads on this item were so bad that I couldn't get it to screw into any of my fittings without spraying water all over ...even with pipe tape. Its total junk. I would have returned it but for as cheap as it was it's not really worth bothering with for me. Also i found out from another amazon reviewer that those ball valve splitters (Gilmour 13 Brass 2-Way Connector) are the way to go as you can simply turn the valve to adjust the pressure and have true control a range of pressure until you get to your desired one for your needs. So this item really is obsolete plus its made of plastic where the ball valve type splitters are made of solid brass. Hope this helps someone avoid ordering something they didn't even need like i did.
5,Nancy Rue rocks,Love her getting the heart of the matter and protraying people as they really are. How faith really should affect everyday life. Love 'ya Nancy!
5,So Amazin is So Fire,This cd is hot the beats are hot Cool&Dre hooked her up. Ms. Milian is on top of her game.This is a must get cd if you like a mix of hip-hop/r&b style music.She is a very talented woman and she shines on this cd. This is a cd were you can lissen to every last track and not skip one.GO GET IT NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3,betta than most but not amazing,"This release from 06 is OK, has a couple edgier hip hop jams, one of which sounds dated (only 5 years?!) like 2005 G Unit. Has more mid tempo & ballads. Not much variety. I like ""Its About Time"" much more."
2,I think that this album isnt that great.,"I think that Christina's voice isnt really suited to hip hop, but more to pop rnb. I think she has a good voice, but this album just doesnt show that. I think that say i would be better without that annoying rapper saying ""Yeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaahhhhhhh"" in the chorus. That is the most annoying person ive ever heard in my whole entire life."
3,ok....expected better,"I first heard da single ""say I"" which made me like christina all over again...she did it with the song ""dip it low"". But then i heard the album and it didnt quite fit.Best track on the album is ""Who's Gonna Ride"" ft. three 6 mafia and lil wayne.other standout tracks are:-Twisted-So Amazing-Hot Boy-She Don't Know"
5,More than just a pretty face!,"Christina Milian has done it all: music, movies, theater, and dancing! She is extremely talented and this is her incredible third album. You think she's a faceless video icon? Think again, buddy! This is the REAL DEAL!!"
4,crossword puzzle dictionary,A special person in my life rquested this item for a birthday gift because she had worn out a previous issue and liked it well enough to want another
4,Poker chips,"The poker chips were exactly as described, in goodcondition, clean, and very usable. I can think ofsome creative, learning experiences that could beof use to children--but that was not the purpose ofthe purchase."
4,pretty good,This radio/clock is pretty good. The only bad part is you can't listen to the radio when the alarm is set because the power button has to be off for the alarm to work. But that's okay because I have a separate alarm clock. I only bought this for the radio....:)
4,Needs a Sequel,"""Dream City"" compares with Mike Royko's ""Boss"" as an excellent expose on urban politics. But while Royko's protagonist, Mayor Richard Daley of Chicago, at least had his city's best interests in mind despite the shortcomings of his political machine, Marion Barry only cared about one thing, Marion Barry. That this vulture perpetuated his own power on the backs of the powerless who were his strongest supporters is sickening and fascinating at the same time. ""Dream City"" was published in 1994, right before the leech Barry returned to the Mayor's office to do four more years of damage to the capital city. Under Daley, Chicago was ""The City That Works."" Under Barry, DC was the city that didn't."
2,Lame Retread,"I love low budget independent films and had high hopes for this one. But this film is static. Never mind the production value, which is very noble for its budget, but the pacing is deadly. Admittedly these folks achieve much with little, but the film fails on the most fundamental level. It's boring. The editing is glacial and the pacing stalls. It should have been 65 minutes. The best thing about the Dr. Jekyll is Mr. Hyde who isn't seen nearly enough. He had the most dramatic potential. Instead we have to suffer through dithering Baltimorean-Brits stammer through endless and tiresome exposition. It feels like a backwater stage play committed to video.Noble efforts by everyone in the production, but a story this tired needed a kick in the pants and funky new low budget technology should have given it a fresh voice. Instead it's just a lame retread."
4,Pleasant Surprise,"Forget the film's low budget; Redfield alone makes this one well-worth the price and the time. He is a very gifted and natural actor who gives new life to Stevenson's two-sided character. The entire cast is way above average, including Elena Torrez, who is mesmerizing as Claire, Kosha Engler as Jekyll's ill-fated fiance and Carl Randolph as his friend and confidant; but it is Redfield's film and he gives us a Jekyll and Hyde we are not likely to forget. Given the mostly lame fare Hollywood is turning out these days, it's encouraging to see professionals of this caliber produce entertaining films like this one."
5,A fantastic book about computers & hackers,"An amazing book that chronicles the beginnings of the personal computer age, including how the present-day institutions of Microsoft and Apple started out. It is truly the one book that defined what a hacker is and can make almost anyone understand the passion many people have for computers. I have read it 2 or 3 times since it first came out and I still love it."
5,A thoroughly engaging book; should be re-read every year,"I first read this book in the late 1980s, as a teenaged computer enthusiast, and I was incredibly inspired by the contents. In the mid-1990s, I bought a copy of the trade paperback and I now regularly re-read the stories of the people who share my love of computing.I don't think that you can really understand the motivation of folks like Richard Stallman and the GNU project without reading this book.I would like to see an updated version of this book that covered the period from 1982-2000."
5,This is a good book! :),"I've read this book a couple times, and each time it's just a little more interesting. This is for anybody who wants to know what computers of the past were like, and the people that worked with them. Suggested reading for any computer savvy individual."
2,This book could have been much more...,"I was disappointed with this book: it glossed over many parts of modern computing history to focus on the odd-balls, the unpleasant and the just plain nerdy. The focus appeared to be on MIT SAIL and the early game coding shops. One could be forgiven, if on reading this volume, for believing that micro-computing only happened in the USA on the West Coast.The definitive hacker/PC history is yet to be written..."
1,Yawn...,A really boring book I got here. Many words but it's a really good effort by the authors and the ppl involved. Hope to finish it someday...
2,Too much about obscure Christian sects,"This story about Seraphita/Seraphitus draws the reader in with well-drawn descriptions of the Norwegian fjords, icy hills, and vast spaces. However, the only thing that compelled me to keep reading past the remarkable setting was the intriguing ambiguity about whether the main character was Seraphita or Seraphitus.Unfortunately, the main point of the whole story was religious awakening. There was extensive discussion of Swedenborg, who apparently founded yet another Christian sect. So unless one is very interested in obscure Christian sects, or is willing to skip large sections of boring text this book might be avoided."
2,Be prepared for some seriously pompous language,"Guillermo should be avoided by all of those who can. I am told you are better off reading Collier and I am sure that anything is better than reading this arrogant academian. Our consensus (""lo pòpular"" o ""el pueblo"") is that Guillermo must enjoy knowing that it takes longer Moby Dick than one of his chapters . . with such words as oligopolistic, reification, referent mediation, who wouldn't enjoy this gem of political scince?"
2,If you know a beetle's not a bee...you've outgrown this one,"The book may be useful for an extreme novice in bug collection and identification, or for helping youngsters. It superficially treats any given group of insects, with less detail than I had anticipated. Most of the insects illustrated are foreign, which was disappointing. This is a book that will sit on the shelf until I decide which nephew to give it to."
4,Fascinating story,"I heard this book read on NPR's Radio Reader, while I was in Alaska fishing the Bristol Bay Salmon run. I didn't get to finish the story, so have ordered my own copy of the book. I liked what I heard, I found it somewhat ironic to be slapping mosquitos while listening to the people in the story being tormented by them, as well. Kafka does a great job of creating characters so three-dimensional that their personalities pop out of the story even through the voice of Dick Estell. The settings and the people in this story come across as authentic ""bush"" Alaska, which, by the way, is very different from ""the outback"". (Isn't that a steak house?)"
3,True North,"It was a enjoyable book, but it wasnt Michener's Alaska. Nor was it a Jack London book. It was good until the ending, there it kind of faded like the sun for 6 months. It seemed that she got tired of writing and just wanted to end it the quickest way possible... However I do look forward to her next book...maybe"
1,A painful read,"As an avid reader of Alaskan mysteries I was excited to see a new author. Except that the story took so long to unfold, the main character seemed psycotic and morose. The is one of the few books that I have read in past years that I have really disliked. In the first 18 pages she talks about being a hermit, her dog disappearing (for which she doesn't seem upset) not wanting to talk to people (interesting for a bush pilot) has 3 flashbacks and tells you she basically doesn't want human contact..... If you want a good Alaskan mystery try Christopher Lane or Sue Henry!"
5,Perfect for my purse,"I have been using this product for years. This size is perfect to carry on my purse, the little bottle is elegant and cute"
3,"Sturdy placemat,vibrant pictures,small font",The placemat is very sturdy and seems able to withstand liquid spills on it due to its laminant. Good vibrant colors and pictures. The only downfall I see is that some of the printing is very small making it hard to read.
3,It was a great book minus half the story.,"Pier's anthor's first books were great, but they seem to keep on declining in intrest. His first books were so intesely intresting, they could keep you up all night. Now I find it almost a drudgery to go out and buy them."
1,usual insipid boring anthony storyline,"He's flogged Xanth to death now - surely Anthony must haveenough money by now... what started out as witty, refreshing and GOOD is now a pile of S#@T.He should take a long break and get some of the old magic back instead of churning these books out like there's no tomorrow!"
3,Predictable and formulaic,"I'm a great fan of Demoness Metria (the main reason I bought most of Anthony's books after he wrapped up his original ""trilogy""; I even wrote a small homage to her in one of my books) but I was sorely disappointed after reading ""Roc and a Hard Place"". I was expecting something very unusual after my favorite Demoness got split up into two different identities (D.Metria and D.mentia) in ""Gargoyle Geis"", but all I got was a tale (which devolves in to a courtroom drama) that merely reduced her to a courier-boy role.Piers Anthony's quality writing still endures, but the problem is that he has started to become more and more formulaic: character wants something, consults with Humphrey, gets a quest to do and attain what he/she wants. If you're a fan who doesn't want to spoil the memorable reads you've experienced in ""Man from Mundania"" and ""Question Quest"", I think you'd do yourself a big favor if you stopped reading any subsequent books in this long-lived series. I wish I did."
4,A maverick piece of Americana,"Only recently has the British film censor lifted the ban placed on this film in 1964, and even then, it can only be supplied to persons aged 18 or over. It is however quite a moral film showing how, as we become more and more ""caged"" in our own little egos, we become indifferent and hardened to the plight of others. The pursuit of materialistic consummerism results in a loss of human empathy as all values are reduced to mere commodity. Good acting and production values, as well as a score which also unsettles and disturbs, this film shocks and may offend, but it has a message we must all respond to, sooner or later."
4,Highly underrated! Ending will blow you away!,"The symbolism is rampant in this flick, and the metaphors are carefully painted. Olivia's performance was a revelation to me, as I've never seen her in anything other that Gone With the Wind. She's one hell of an actress. The suspense is without relief throughout the film, but the ending is absolutely superb. There is one 2 second shot of film at the end that is so horrifying, it will stay with you for days!"
4,Essential listening for the two-step fan...,"This album is basically a collection of Wookie's best singles, and they are blazin'. This producer has had quite an impact on England's burgeoning two-step sound. Unlike many tracks of the moment, many of these are timeless. These instant classics do not fall into the pitfalls of cheese overload as so many other contemporary garage tracks do. This album is 0% filler, and 100% groovin' beats. Sleep on this album at your own peril!"
5,"I was quite taken, though this reads faster than my usual","Mr. Nilsson has created a brisk, compelling tale, apparently designed to rip the sleepy eyelids off of the MTV Generation so that they may see history for perhaps the first time.An excellent purchase.The buyer may note that the copy I received had a striking gold cover, with a shadow on the back."
4,Great Headphones,"From the moment you take them out of the box, you know these headphones are not ordinary. The light-weight, softness and feel of these phones hit you immediately. Even the cords extending from them feel like heaven to the touch. And the sound is very distinct - exceptionally clear and bright. The bass is not over-powering but adequate, and could be a little stronger if you prefer strong bass. All in all, a beautiful set of headphones in more ways than one. Great sounding, as well as stylish and comfortable. Seems like they could be worn for hours without ever feeling them. Good price for such quality and worth every penny!"
3,"poor QA, cannot wear it long","Purchased this to replace the old Denon headphone I love. This one is double the price of the old one, but it is look plastic cheap.1. the two small black pieces of plastic betweetn the silver plastic and the foam fell of constantly. Look like the small screws were never put in or just dropped off.2. The grip is very strong. I started to feel very uncomfortable of the pressure on both sides of the head and the weight of the headphone on top.Sound is good but not great. The old Denon headphone is more comfortable and the sound is much better (a bit last bass than this one).Overall, I am disappointed with the headphone consider the price of it."
3,Okay... I think..,Well I have used this twice since I bought it.. Honestly I haven't seen a difference in my blonde hair yet.. but my cousin/stylist said it might take a few applications. Lets hope it works! I love Nexxus priducts!
3,works good my gray hair,I use it together with blue dye on my gray hair giving it light silver blue hue works well for what I wanted
2,A Generous Two Stars,"I think two stars is generous for this soundtrack. Two discs of songs and only totalling 20 tracks first of all is sort of a ploy by the music industry I don't really like..I want more than 10 tracks per disc. Also, spliting the rock and rap discs seems a little ridiculous to me. But to the music, two stars is still generous since out of 20 tracks, I found only three noteworthy ones and even they are stretches. The remix of ""Bodies"" butchers the song in my opinion compared to the the original track found on Drowning Pool's Sinner album. Noteworthy songs were Orbital's Technologique and Fermin IV...the ""Bush"" song ""Adernaline"" is pretty weak in comparision to other Bush tracks. As for the second disc, I found nothing I enjoyed there at all, just a bunch of tracks that sound the same. If you're into music that sounds the same and such, this CD is for you...but from me, I don't recommend this one is a rush and buy."
3,It was ok.,I mostly liked the accent the girls have. Sexy! I would love to try my hand at making one of these but I have no idea where to get the hot chicks to be in it... :)
4,The Golden Age of Dance (Pop) Trance,Disc one has all the favorites. Classic Ministry of Sound when it actually was cool. Last good disc before the demise of MOS.
3,"Nice pictures, but several important editorial mistakes","One of the featured cake's pictures is missing, sloppy layout errors in a table of cooking times/cake size/recipe amount, and an error in ingredient quantities of one of the basic cakes made this book a disappointment. It is lovely to look at, but the errors make me doubt the overall accuracy of the recipes."
1,I bought this book and was disappointed!,"Oh my....this book is certainly off the beaten track. Here is an author who decided the topic of 666 would probably sell, so he moved forward to discuss it with a completely empty bag of knowledge. The author himself must have published this book because any publishing house with adequate knowledge would not have touched it. And how in the world can anyone write or read about 666 without mentioning the Roman Empire or the Catholic Church? It is like writing about the State of New York without ever mentioning New York City. Like writing about poetry without ever mentioning the word ""stanza."" I say to all readers out there, ""forget this book. It is based on lousy information and a few assorted scare tactics that don't hold the water of logic."
3,A very spirited adventure with a little touch of sexism.,"After years of trying to find the very first book of the whole Xanth series, I decided on ""Orge, Orge"". I truly love the brilliant use of idioms as gags (riding off on a nightmare, for instance) as well as the really hilarious scenes involving the gentle-natured orge and his girlish-girly troop. And there are also simply beautiful images so playfully painted to depict this very creative fantasy playground. (Hey, I used to live in Xanth - the ""Tampa"" area, to be exact!) There's one thing, however that totally turns me off. Some of the passages in this books reads as if a hormone-crazed adolescent boy had written it during his sexual fits. This attitude suggested a bit of good-humored predatory as well as that repulsive ""love"" scene between the orge and the little fairy maiden. So - that was the very last book I have ever read about the fabled land of Xanth."
4,This was a replacement,"My son had accidently destroyed my husband's version. so this was a replacement. They both loved the book, and say that ii is great."
2,Worst Xanth story I've read so far,"Most of the characters in this book were shallow things, easily forgotten. The main character was made so incredibly different than his appearance in Castle Roogna, that I no longer cared about him. Even Crombie, who is only referenced in this book, had his character changed.The story was moderately entertaining, and was the only thing that kept me from quitting this one early."
3,Cancer Herbs,"The book is Okay, does not carry rain forrest remedies but it's Okay.If you are trying to improve your health talk to a Naturopathic doctor first.Above all else know that you do have natural options that can be used along with conventional medicine. www.healingconcepts.info"
5,a clear concise view of Hollywood in the 30's,"Fitzgerald's last unfinished novels is one of his best in that his style has evolved from his cluttered previous novels into a clean and unfettered one. Every event that occurs is absolutely vital to the plot. He masters the mood and atmosphere of Hollywood. His protagonist has the same rags to riches story, same charisma, and same leadership qualities as his other characters, Gatsby and Dick Diver. However, Stahr is the more developed character. Even unfinished, this tragic tale has a clear theme and style."
4,Rainforest Sounds,"This CD has lots of rainfall sounds, birds twittering, etc. Very low key and soothing. Bought it to keep my parrots happy when I'm away. They listened carefully and seemed to enjoy the mood."
2,Not made in Italy,"If you see the description: made in Italy, be careful! They are made in India. I have written to amazon to let them change. But if you still see made in Italy, be careful! Everybody knows the difference."
