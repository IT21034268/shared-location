3,pieces of time,"Jim Jarmusch presents a series of unrelated conversations between celebrities/individuals over coffee and cigarettes. It is disconnected, not entirely entertaining at times, but despite being hit or miss, was watchable. Of particular note are the hilarious chat between the stellar Alfred Molina and British Steve Coogan, and also between Cate Blanchett and herself playing her own cousin. Also quite humorous, the conversation between Iggy Pop and Tom Waits. The rest of all right, but really rather slow and a little dull. Then again, not every conversation over coffee and cigarettes is going to be riveting. Maybe that is the point."
1,Burnt coffee smell,"This just might be one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time. Probably the worst piece of writing I can remember. What a cast though! Bill Murray, Cate Blanchett to name a couple.With so much star power, did these people owe the director a favor or something? I watched Iggy Pop and Tom Waits stumble through a scene that was better suited for a high school talent show.Very bad."
2,Missed by a mile.,"I generally like and enjoy the films of Jim Jarmusch. But this one just fell flat. The situations in most of these little windows on moments are basically quite silly and terribly contrived. I kept hoping the film would get better as it went along and each section came up lacking. The only one that evoked any interest in me at all was the bit with Iggy Pop and Tom Waits. Other than that, I was completely disappointed in what appeared to be a haphazard jumble of poorly scripted short films stitched together by intervening titles."
2,Uneventful,"This movie is a compilation of short movies of singular and plural people hanging around in cafes and diners over simply cigarettes and coffee. Some movies are duds but some of them are totally brilliant and funny. Alfred Molina and Steve Coogan conversation, entitled ""Cousins?"", Cate Blanchett playing herself and her cousin in ""Cousin"", the Whites from the White Stripes are some of the gems that you can find in here. It's really unique to have singers partaking in this project such as Iggy Pop, Tom Waite, Wu-Tang Clan, White Stripes. Bizzare, uneventful and something to be enjoyed in DVD. No extras. Commendable watching."
1,Would Not Recommend!!!!!!,"We purchased the Xantrex 802-1500 XPower 1500 Watt Portable Powerpack in September 2011. We fully charged it upon receiving it and charged it 3 or 4 times over this last year and didn't have an opportunity to use it until Hurricane Sandy last week. It lasted only an hour with a refrigerator and small radio plugged into it. It would not recharge and had an awful odor while charging. We have had a 1000 watt Xantrex in the past and were very pleased with it and used it for 4 years. That was why we chose Xantrex, but the 1500 watt did not stand up to our expectations."
1,Don't buy Xantrex 1500 X Power,"What a bad experience! Xantrex brand has been discredited with this product.It has inside 3 batteries of 17 ampers each and they come discharged, and never charge.If you buy a Xantrex 1500 XPower, you will lost your money."
5,Great back-up.. Charger died after 1 month..,"If you need a great back-up for your basement sump pump, this is it. Keep it in shape by running power, hand tools when working near it. It is easily moved arround(up and down stairs) by one person. I am very pleased with this product. BUT, the charger died after 1 month. Sincerely, Charlie Holmes. U.S.Navy Veteran 1967-1971."
2,Not what we expected,"After several bouts with basement flooding because of heavy rains and no power, we bought this because we wanted to be make sure that our sump pump would come on after the power went out--even if we were not home. Turns out that won't work. If you leave the sump pump plugged into the fully charged unit, it will drain the battery completely--even if the sump pump never comes on. So, you have to be home to switch to the backup power source. Not really worth the $300+ at all."
1,Bad experience,"The unit failed after I owned it only five weeks. I was only actually used it a few times for short durations. I tried to use it one day and the fault light was illuminated and no ac power was coming out of the outlets. I returned it for repair or replacement 3 weeks ago after receiving a RMA number. I contacted Xantrex and they say they don't know anything about it, and the RMA number is not in there system. The customer support is impossible to get on the phone, and email support takes days to get back to you. They do offer to sell you another unit for 40% off though instead of sending me a replacement.UPDATE: Xantrex did finally replace the first unit. Two months later the replacement also failed. They refuse to refund my money."
1,Still waiting for the replacement (4 months),We purchased the 1500 Watt power pack. The only appliance connected to it was an answering machine. It was charged daily for about 8 hours. 3 weeks later the battery would no longer charge. Sent it back and have not heard anything. They are very hard to get in touch with
3,So Far.....Pleased,"Purchased this at a Super Reduced Price for what they were selling for everywhere else. It charged well.....in a couple of hours shorter than the Max time to fully charge. Used it with a Fan and Lamp so far. Worked fine. However, when I received it, the Date of Manufacture was sometime in 2005. I purchased this in Apr 2011. The paperwork inside stated to charge immediately and that if not kept charged, it could permanently damage the battery. The Charge on it was almost completely dead. Again though, it charged up well. I just don't know if the battery will hold up well when I really begin to use it. I don't know if others come like this as well."
1,Xantrex 1500 Powerpack,This product did not work for me. The first powerpack would not charge from the AC Charger 5 because supposedly the battery sat too long on the shelf and became totally dead. I was sent a replacement and that one did the same thing after it tried to charge for a minute or so. I returned both powerpacks for a complete refund.
1,Waste of Money,"If you're looking for a cordless impact drill to get those frozen, rusted, threadlocked or just plain difficult nuts and bolts--this impact drill is NOT what you want.I don't care how this Milwaukee impact drill is rated, I have found it totally useless for anything needing *Tool Time* power. It was back to breaker bars and pipe extensions.What a total waste of money."
5,good enough,So far I am more than satisfied. I have been using it as a track wrench for changing wheels/tires from street to race and back again at auto x events. One battery can do at least two cars easily and maybe more. I have not tried reaching max torque. I have used a torque stick for 65 ft/lb and have reached that with no problem by holding a few seconds. Tool is heavy but it sure beats the alternative.
5,dranzer V rocks!,Dranzer V is a very powerful beyblade.It has a great attack.It also has great looks.It's got good defense and endurance.At first I didnt think it was so great when my brother got it.I only lost 3 times with Dranzer V.If you get any beyblade get Dranzer V!
3,Bad Ending,"The first 90% of this episode was good. We saw good character development in Spock, an interesting mystery, a romance involving Spock, and Captain Kirk facing mutiny. But how does he solve the dilemma of riding the people of the spores? A subsonic transmitter! Granted they have transporters and warp speed capability, but isn't this stretching things a bit too far? Like Tomorrow Is Yesterday, D. C. Fontana wrote a very bad ending. The episode was almost saved when Spock said that for the first time in his life he was happy. But I still can't get over how it crashed and burned at the end."
4,A Great Little Board Board to Foster Faith in Little Ones,"There is a newer edition of this book, but it is published in Great Britian, 2001. Very simply, this book is written to teach children to give thanks for all the blessings they have around them. The book focuses on the simple things, the things that matter most to young children such as family, friends, pets, a pile of leaves to jump in, and so on. The book is written for children age 1-3, but I think even a new reader might appreciate the simple phrases and the bright illustrations. If faith is something that matters to you, and you want to teach your children about how easy it is to pray, then this book is for you."
3,Pretty good,"This book has some pretty good info, but it is not the best book of its genre. I'd read Ortega's ""In Same We Trust"""
2,A little over the top,"Bill Quinn wrote this book because he hates Wal-mart. And there certainly are genuine criticisms to be made. For example, there is Wal-mart's phony ""Buy American"" campaign (during which this reviewer found them selling ""Ameri-co"" shirts made in Malaysia). This book discusses the ""Buy America"" campaign at length. Other topics include the various lawsuits against Wal-mart, and its hard-line dealings with suppliers.However, I think Mr. Quinn doth protest too much. He blames Wal-mart when a customer slips on a cough drop in a store and falls, and when another customer is raped in a Wal-mart parking lot, and when another customer purchases a gun by lying on the purchase form. In such cases, Mr. Quinn desperately needs a reality check."
1,sad sad item,i bought this for my daughter thinking it was a plasma ball it is not it is a plate with a huge battery case . it is as thick as it is wide and the electricity will not follow your finger. if u buy this u will be unhappy
5,Kick back and enjoy the ride!!!,"I just finished reading Chess For Juniors and got on line here and found out it was the best selling chess book on amazon.com.Bravo! I was looking for a second book on chess and will soon order another one in the Chess For Juniors series. I did not know it was part of a series until just now.What I like about Chess For Juniors is that it has a lot of stuff it it. It does not just teach you the moves and simple rules. It teaches you ways to win the opponents pieces and different ways to checkmate to win.I found the book to be very funny at certain times and loved some of the stories. So, I just kicked back and enjoyed reading the book from cover to cover!"
5,"Clear, Easy to Understand, Some great Humor to Keep Kids Interest","CHESS FOR JUNIORS is an extremely inspirational guide for kid (or adults!) to gain a well balanced introduction into the basics of chess.You are guided through twenty well organized lessons that build on each other. At first you are introduced to the rules of chess. And, some of the more difficult rules to learn (like the ""en passant"" capture) are give careful care to make sure that the student (even a 7 year old!) understands.Well, I have seen a little criticism here of the humor used in the book (that person or persons should get a life!). But I feel that this is a strong point of the book, which kids like. Educational - well yes! If it keeps the kids interest!This book is the finest introductory book on chess ever written!"
5,Worth Every Penny!,This sharpener is amazing! It is worth every penny. I used to sharpen my kitchen knives for hours by hand to get the edge this machine gives me in seconds.
5,Highly Recommend,Being a huge fan of America's Test Kitchen I couldn't wait to buy this sharpener. It is as great as they say and super easy to use.You won't be disappointed and you'll love the edge it puts on your knives!
4,Works well once I practiced,So don't expect it to magically create the perfect edge at first try... I took others advice and practiced on some old Trident steak knives we were about to throw out because I wasnt going to take the time to hand sharpen them. After practicing and re-reading the instructions I think I have it down now. Our old knives are rejuvenated and I don't have to worry about my imperfect manual technique. It helped to use a strong magnifying glass to see how the edge was progressing on very dull knives. It is rather pricey (my reason for subtracting a star) but I am also going to sharpen other family and friends' sets.
4,Happy with Chef's Choice M130 purchase,"I purchased the Chef's Choice M130 about a month ago. Our knives hadn't been sharpened in over two years so they were way overdue. I immediately read the directions and sharpened according to what I read. I found the process to be easy to understand and to execute. Most importantly after sharpening, our knives regained their edge and we found things much easier to cut as a result."
4,Works as advertised!,Took me sometime to figure out how to sharpen my knives but finally I got results after several trials. The seller failed to tell me that one of the rubbers (legs) was missing to keep the machine on firm footing. I had to improvise and make a rubber leg (I gave it a 4 star for that reason otherwise it would be a 5 star).
1,Hidden defect,"I was very disappointed when I tried this out, it performed poorly. I could get a knife sharper, faster myself, manually.I put it aside after the holidays and just tried it again. I realized that one problem was the middle sharpening station (#2), nothing was happening. It was almost impossible to see anything, but with a very bright light and glass, I could see that there was nothing at the bottom or sides of the guides, no stone, no steel, no disc. Manufacturing mistake, wrong model? I don't know. Past 30 days, I can't return it and no luck with chefs choice. Buyer beware."
3,Chefs Choice M130 Professional Sharpening Station,"From the description of the M130 I was expecting to receive a machine that would be the answer to all of my sharpening problems, but it was not to be. It took many repetitions of dragging my kitchen knives through the number one and number three sharpening wheels before I got any results that resembled what the instruction manual indicated I should get. I'm hoping with time and practice I can become better adept at putting a professional edge on my kitchen knives, but I would hesitate to recommend the M130 to a novice like myself. Spend less and try one of the less fancy models. You'll probably do just as well."
5,M130 Knife Sharpening Unit Outstanding,"I'm extremely pleased with the M130. Came out of the box and performed exactly as Cooks Test Kitchen said it would. Great price, free shipping on Amazon and no sales tax. I rest my case. Directions from manual very easy to follow. I will use the unit quite a bit as I've had friends bring over knives to see the results."
3,Chef's Choice Sharpener,"I found that some knives were easy to sharpen while others didn't really get sharp. My chef's knife came out great. However, the smaller the knife, the more of a challenge it was to get it sharp. I was fearful that I would destroy some of my more expensive knives, so I did not try to sharpen them. Perhaps with more practice, I will not be so hesitant to tackle the higher quality knives. I practiced on old knives at first and some came out OK while others remained dull. I tried to sharpen a paring knife but that proved impossible because of the short blade. I do not regret my purchase for some results were quite good. I guess it was the inconsistency of the machine that proved somewhat disappointing."
1,JUNK YARD FODDER!,"I also am glad some children were able to make this work... wish my kid was one of those. But as it is, I spent over an hour putting it together and none of it seems to stay together. The vibrating part shakes the rest of the track loose... we were only able to make it go round and round the track the very first time we used it and that was it! The track right in front of the vibrating piece comes off within seconds EACH TIME. Also, it is kind of dangerous... it has actually come close to taking my eye out! The car gets thrown through that vibrating part and sends it hauling [...] along the track only to fly off towards an unsuspecting victim. Hope we don't hear of an accident because of this corporately greedy piece of Wal-Mart JUNK!!! Geez, Wal-Mart, Target, Amazon... do you guys just sell ANYTHING the movies make... even after all these lousy reviews?"
2,Not really worth the money,"My son received this for Christmas. I thought it was a great idea for something to do with all of the cars. He has almost every car since he loves the movie. He played with it for a few days and never turned it on again. The ""wheel"" does not really work well. I guess you can only watch cars race along a track so many times....."
2,Not Worth It,"My son got this as a present for his 5th birthday. It took me and my husband nearly an hour to put it together, and after less than half an hour of playing it promptly fell apart. The spinning wheels that shoot the cars around the track have no protection for little fingers either, a fact that I found extremely worrysome as little boys love to poke at their toys to see how they work. After putting the track together for probably the tenth time in a week, it went in the trash. It's flimsy, unstable, doesn't stay put together (falls apart just from the toy car going around on the track), and is not safe. Highly disappointed."
1,"Overpriced, poorly designed use of recycled milk jugs","Don't work: connectors don't hold, places are to narrow or tight for the included car. Car gets hung, falls off the track, and the unit is just unstable. I had to explain to my son what an ""idiot"" is and how they hype toys to exploit money from children. Bottom line: Garbage. Merry Chistmas!"
3,"Newer and Shorter, but not Better","I've perused this and find it a poor substitute for the original tome--no doubt this abbreviated paperback version will be of some use to the cost-conscious student or the briefcase-toting lawyer, but it cannot compare with the cultural and linguistic treasure-trove to be found in the 10-pound hardcover version. If you buy this, you should still plan on buying the Real McCoy!"
2,reply to disappointed,"I, too, had been looking for the Buzz Lighyear that is like the one in the movie. Several of my son's friends have that one, and that's the one he wants. I'm glad I didn't go for this one. [An online store] has the original."
5,...just when I thought they couldn't take it anywhere new...,"New plot twists and characters true to Season One--and oh, so much more! I watch it with my daughter and grandchildren, so it's great for all ages."
5,Magic has come,This show is so good! What a spin on classic fairy tales. All of the characters are played so well. Mr. Gold is by far one of the best characters in the show his acting is superb. This is a must see! You are captured from the very first episode!
5,Great way to watch this program,Quality is great and it is so much easier to follow the story line without the interruption of constant ads
5,LOVE the series Once Upon a Time,I purchased just one episode to see how it would work on my Kindle Fire. I LOVE it. I'll order more. :)
5,BEST SHOW EVER!!!!!,"I lovelovelove the script, the acting, everything! I especially loved the way they put a spin on the different fairy tales in order to connect them and make them into a cohesive ""super-fairy-tale"". Just awesome. Can't wait for the rest of the season!"
2,Not as good as season 1,"***Overall Show***Show is solid, season 1 showed real promise. Very reminiscent of LOST (each episode is about one character, frequent & revealing flashbacks, super-natural forces, examines the nature of faith). Suffers from occasionally lazy writing and ""Deus Ex Machina"" style resolutions. David Nolan cries a little too often.***Season 2***After a solid first season, season 2 is lazy and a little disappointing. It's not terrible, but it's surprising after a solid first season. It seems like they had solid ideas for the overall story arc of season 1, and then were left scrambling to find ways to fill a second season. Also the writing has changed and is lazier, and with less attention to solid character development."
5,Love this Series!,I guess I'm still a kid at 71 years old but I love this series. I really think it's aimed at an adult audience not really for small children.
3,Watching season 2,it plays great but it's disappointing to pay 199 an episode. I think you should get a discount if you buy the entire season at one time.
5,Love it,"I love love love this series. You do need to watch from the beginning our you won't get it, but it is something well written and so different!! Love it!!"
4,Good recap of the first season!,I thought they put together a good recap of the important events in the story. This is a great review before starting the second season.
4,Fun Show,"I find the show innovative, funny, and fun to watch. The special effects are not the best, but you can have everything."
5,Love this show,The writers have taken these well known fairy tails to an all new level. Watching it on netflix and waiting for the next season to be available.
5,Wonderful,I loved the first Season and dying to see the second season. This is a very refreshing and well written tv series. I recommend this to everyone. Very good acting and it flows well. I have many favorite characters. I feel Mr. Gold was very convincing and fabulous. The whole series is captivating and entertaining. Nothing has been this great out there for a long time. It's nice to see shows this great of magnitude out there. Very imaginative!! Well Done.
1,just a review of the previous season,not worth anything just a review of the previous season. Not a single new thing. What a waste of money
2,Didn't like it!!,"I didn't like this show. I gave it a chance by watching season one but for me something still was missing from the story line that didn't quite satisfy me. I like the concept of Fairy Tale characters living in two worlds but the writing was lacking and didn't pull me in. On top of that the evil Queen was way over the top with her role, making the supporting cast invisible. I wasn't interested in season two, one was enough."
2,wow what a departure,1st season...great! all tied in with each tale tying back to the main theme...This season....if i wanted a soap opera i wouldnt work
1,"No Android support, can't really download episodes","Just discovered that I can't watch this on Android, can't get refunds, and can't really download the episodes. 'Downloading' is in some kind of protected format for downloading only to Kindle or PC. Hooray! Waste of ~$9."
1,"No, no, no, no, NO!","Anyone who has ever read the DC Comics character Steel knows that he has a Ph.D. in engineering, is on nearly the same power level as Superman (and, in fact temporarily replaced Superman when everyone thought he was dead), and is generally one of the most intelligent African-American characters ever developed for comics. No offense to Shaquille O'Neal, but the only thing that he has in common with Steel is that they are both big, bald, Black men. Warner Brothers should be ashamed of itself for destroying this character on film."
3,The main reason I gave such low rating for the doll was because of the hair.,"Since I had to have the whole set of four dolls, I ordered Baby also. I must say I hate her hair. I tried to fix it, but I couldn't straighten the curly mess. At least it looked better down than the side afro. I was hoping to straighten the right side and have it be the same length as the long left side, but no luck."
2,Not that great,Did not fit but made it fit rather than return. They didn't align up with the bottom of the heater.
4,"Nice, but too small for Canon S95","Tried to make this work for my new Canon S95 camera. Very snug fit, a bit too snug for my comfort level. Trying to find the Rezo 20 which is supposed to fit it perfectly but it looks like no one has them in stock, and it is no longer available from Lowepro. Seems well made though, if you have a smaller camera."
5,Apple Chips,Didn't realize it was actually 6 bags of chips in one big bag. It's exactly what I was looking for.
5,Buy this for Silver Springs,"If for no other reason, get this for Silver Springs. Mic Fleetwood should be disciplined for leaving this song off of the original Rumors album. Had it been included, there would have been 2 #1 singles instead of just Dreams.However, Fleetwood's ""mistake"" ... is vindicated because without the history associated with this song and its particular signifigance to her, Nick's could not deliver the performance of a lifetime. When she sings this song, this time, each note carries the pain-reflex and resignation of love unfulfilled or unfulfilling - whether it's corporeal love or the mystical love of a songwriter for her long-ignored work.Not that the rest of the album isn't good to great. Even the new stuff is good (I LOVE ""My Little Demon"") and consistent in quality with the old stuff.Get this album - it's an education in what a musically trascendent ensemble can do when they're darn good songwriters and musicians."
3,Love Landslide!,"I bought this album for Landslide, which I only heard at a Tori Amos concert. I also have a bootleg of Tori singing Landslide at another concert. From hearing the Tori Amos version, I fell in love with the passion and flowing tempo of the song. I thought it would be the same for the original. Was I wrong! Fleetwood Mac takes it too fast, and there's no feeling behind those lyrics. They're gorgeous lyrics, why don't you use them? Tori is amazing because the passion in her voice can fit exactly what she's saying. Sorry to say this, (actually I'm not), Tori's version is 110 times better. Tori forever!"
5,"Stevie Nicks is still the Queen; always was, always will be","The reuniting of Fleetwood Mac was the best thing that happened in all of 1997. They're better than ever, passionate and commanding with every note. Christine blows ""Temporary One"" out of the water and John, Mick, and Lindsey tear up their respective instruments. But the kicker is Stevie getting her revenge with ""Silver Springs,"" sailing through ""Landslide"" and introducing us to one of the best songs she ever penned, ""Sweet Girl."" If you don't get chills as she rips through the final chorus of ""Silver Springs,"" call a doctor. You may have a condition."
4,Good comeback.,"""The Dance"" (1997), #1. What a comeback, the original 1975 group gets back together for this live broadcast on MTV in 1997. Some fine musicianship all the way around. Of all the new songs, ""Temporary Ones"" by Christine McVie and ""Bleed To Love Her"" and ""My little Demon"" by Lindsey Buckingham are very good indeed, on ""Demon: this has a new wave sound to it. Lindsey could create for this band). ""Landslide gave the band a #51 hot 100 entry. Christine McVie would leave the band after this tour."
5,They rock!,This is almost like a greatest hits cd with lots and lots of emotions. They did an excellent job picking what songs went on here. My favorites are all of them. And I love the new lyrics on rhiannon!
5,Buy the album!,"This CD has changed the way I look at music forever. Seven years after the fact, I'm still blown away every time I listen. Do yourself a favor and listen to this CD."
4,KATHRYN,PRODUCT WAS DELIVERED IN A TIMELY MANNER AND IN THE CONDITION IT WAS DESCRIBED. GOOD SERVICE. WOULD DEAL WITH THIS VENDOR AGAIN
4,There's Only a Couple Of Reasons To Own This...,"2 words, Lindsey Buckingham. His parched, angry vocals on ""The Chain"" and the still astounding, flamenco-laced take on ""Big Love"" are passionate rock music at it's best. You've heard the rest before."
3,Good but not at these prices,"Ok Elmo is funny but after a few goes the novelty wears off. Why pay so much for him?? Don't fall for the hype - use your imagination and get more value for your money. After all post Christmas, Elmo will be back in the stores for his original price of approx $40."
3,A Mindless Toy - Just Fun for a Few Days,"I have to agree with those who say that Elmo has an infectious laugh - it is contageous.Unfortunately, my daughter lost interest in TMX Elmo after only a few days. He doesn't really do much but laugh and roll around. Half the time when he rolls, he can't stand himself back up. It was like, once she had seen it so many times, it really wasn't entertaining anymore.This was kind of an impulse buy on my part, because I normally like to buy things that she will get more out of, especially intellectually. The fact that it didn't keep her interest makes me again realize why I steer clear from this type of ""mindless"" toys and aim for ones that she will play with over and over and will utimately benefit her development in some way."
1,Scary and pointless,I would have rated elmo a 0 if I could have. My 2 year old wont go anywhere near the creepy moving elmo. It kind of scares me itself. Whoever thought of it was NOT thinking of little ones.
4,Great gift for all ages!,"tmx elmo is a great gift for young children through teens through adults and seniors. Stored in a a terrific box, which shouts ""Elmo ticklish in here, get me out"" the laughter started immediately. The older ones were more interested in the mechanics of watching elmo, rollover with laughter,sit up and return to standing position. Bought one as a baby gift and one for my family to share. They were pleased as well."
3,Average review,"My son received TME for his 1st birthday. He enjoys playing Elmo, but I have found 2 drawbacks with this toy. The first is the little red pieces of fuzz that flaked all over his play space when we took it out of the box. I had to take a hair dryer to it and try to get all the loose fuzz off. SEcond, I find it isn't a matter of tickling Elmo, but rather patting his tummy to get him going. That said, now when I lay down to do my exercises, my son pats me on the tummy, something he undoubtedly learned from playing with Elmo. That's my two cents."
3,Elmo TMX,I purchased Elmo for my 2 year old grandson's xmas present.He is a huge Elmo fan! We all felt that adults are more amazed by this product than kids. It is amazing that it can do all the things it does but all the kids just seemed to look at it like it was stupid. I think it is a huge hit with adults and quite funny but the reaction from the children wasn't that great! Probably would have purchase a different Elmo for less money!
3,Not as exciting as I thought it would be,"I expected a lot more out of the tickle me elmo based on all the great reviews but he gets tickeled and he laughs. I was extrmeley disappointed in the quality, when he was opened by my nephew at his party Elmo began excessively shedding his red fur everywhere, it was emberassing."
3,Expensive Laugh,My daughter wanted this toy for her two-year-old son so I gave it to him & she says it was his favorite birthday gift. It just rolls around and giggles. Beats me why it's so popular.
3,The Elmo Craze Continues,"Ok, I wasn't planning on getting my 2 yr old son one of these, but we happened to be in the store the day they came out and once I opened up the box to try to get a peek and he heard Elmo's voice admonishing ""AH AH AH, NO PEEKING"", it had to go in the cart.At first I just let him play with the box, which amused him for hours. Then I fell victim to the hype and let him open it. Oh how I wish I'd had the video camera on him. His reaction was priceless. He shrieked and laughed and shrieked some more, my usually fairly calm boy.My husband and I were amused by the toy for the first 5 minutes or so, but the novelty quickly wore off, especially when our dog thought it might be a toy for her.While I do think it is cute, I think my son would have benefitted much more from say, a set of unit blocks or something that he can put some imagination into.If I had it to do again I'd get the video camera out and take him to watch one that belongs to a friend. ;)"
3,"Okay- item, but not worth the fight","After months of waiting to get this item from Amazon, we got it and our 15 month old is scared to death of it. It is cute, but to mechanical and not made to hold up to toddlers. We bought a Up Up Elmo and he loves it!"
2,Don't be dumb and pay anything over $30.00 for this thing,"I really hope no one reading this spent gobs of money on this ridiculous toy. It's barely worth the regular price of 37.77 at WalMart. My poor mother waited in line for a delivery truck at Walmart for two hours just a couple of days before Christmas. She fortunately only paid the regular price for it. It was a gift for my 2 year old. He opened the box, laughed at it for literally a minute or two, then moved on to his GeoTrax train set, which we can not pull him away from. TMX Elmo now sits dormant under our Christmas tree catching dust. Neither my 2 year old nor my 3 year old want anything to do with it. If you have not been able to purchase one, just wait until the price drops and the market is saturated with them, just like back in 1996 with the regular Tickle Me Elmo. This is just another media hyped toy that isn't worth anything."
5,grandma with a cute Elmo,I purchased Elmo for my grand-daughter. We both loved the toy so much we can't get enough. He is funny little guy. I think others feel the same.
1,What a crazy world we live in,"I'm thoroughly disgusted by how companies hike up the prices on toys. First off, why would anyone pay $[...] for a toy that will be played with for a very short time?It's crazy how this world has become such a materialistic, me-centered world. I'm frightened to think of how these kids will grow up, when mommy and daddy got them everything they wanted."
3,rip off,"the toy itself is cute and should make many small child happy. SO if you are lucky enough to get one .. gratz,BUT!!People (ADULTS!!!) buying these things up to make a cheap buck , preventing KIDS from not being able to get their wish SUCK!!.Stores doubling prices are in the same line ..SHAME on you ALL!!!"
4,Elmo makes me laugh,This toy is great for little kids. My two year old can't get enough of it. It is amazing how he can lay down and then stand up by himself. I laugh every time my son plays with Elmo. It's a bit expensive and it doesn't have any educational value.
1,Was broken when recieved,"The product itself I loved, I bought this for my daughter for her 2nd birthday. It was on sale so I bought it early (3 months before her bday) I recieved it in a timely fashion, but stored it in my closet so she wouldnt see it. I wrapped it and gave it to her on her bday, only to open it for her and he would not stand back up after he goes down. I tried to change the batteries, moved him to a hard floor and it would not get back up. I contacted the seller to see if they could work somthing out and they refused flat out because it was over 30 day exchange policy. I payed a small fortune for this and am very disappointed they would not work with me at all."
1,Don't purchase this book used,"I can't comment on the substance of the book because there's no way to read it. My only advice is that if you purchase the book, DON'T buy a used one from Kudzu Books in Georgia. They ship it via the postal service in a very flimsy envelope. By the time you get it, it will be too mangled to read. Worse, they give no hint as to how to contact them by email or phone. Amazon is no help either."
5,Very pleased,I buy dozens of tape measures each year and now that the shop is all metric an all metric tape is great. This tape measure is very well made.
4,Triumphant,"Amalia, Diary Three was one of the better California Diaries books. It's great that there's a series for teenagers which portrays more to life than little boy troubles and other pre-pubescent junk - but real angst and events that happen to us. All people, whether or not a survivor of a racist incident, can relate to being discriminated against - and this book can help you get through it. CD #14 was excellent, though I wish it had been a little longer. Go read! :)"
3,"Fantastic, but...","It's quite good, but: 1. The layout--its just the same. 2. Problems don't change. 3. Story output is unsatisfactory. 4. Details and characters do not blend in. 5. The idea is not clear. May be mixed up.Hope this helps in a professional's bird eye view!Enjoy."
2,Disappointing,"Intrigued by the title, I decided to try out some of the recipes. Making tasty ""junk food"" without meat or eggs sounds like an almost impossible feat, and unfortunately I think that it is.I cannot complain about the layout of the book; although short, the recipes are well organized and easy to follow. I just personally found the results disappointing."
5,Elegant stories and anecdotes of yesteryear.,"Thoughts Of A Boy Growing Up was written by Kenneth Nelson to be a surprise Christmas gift for his seven grandchildren. Nelson shares the story of his life including attending a mountain school, learning about birds and animals as a child, what it was like for him when his family moved to town, being a dairyman, attending Ray Union School, his brother leaving, and a great deal more. These are stories told with the simple candor of someone reflecting on their life experiences to the benefit and entertainment of others, so that they can get a sense of the people and events of a time now gone, but which served to create the man that yesteryear boy would grow up to be. Highly recommended."
4,Gorgeous But Incomplete,"Everything that happens in this novel is depicted sharply, captivatingly, with three storylines that subtly intertwine. This book is gorgeous, horrible, strange, and moving. The reason I didn't give it five stars is that the evil parallel universe wasn't explained convincingly, Smara & Felion were unfathomable, and the ending of their lives was more confusing than the lives themselves."
2,Doesn't help you find a compatible mate,"The book focuses on shallow aspects and should be helpful for folks who don't get themselves outside and their face to smile and say ""Hello"". Following his advice you will learn how to connect to shallow people, who care as much about clothes as you now are told to do. This ""Intimate Connections"" aren't really intimate at all, so if emotional, psychological or intellectual closeness is what you hope for, it's not in this book. (Again unless your emotion, psychology and intellect follow this book's simple prescription.)"
5,Amazing,"The precursor to the incredible Soft Bulliten, Zaireeka is not normal in any sense of the word. Both an experiment and a journey, The Flaming Lips worked on this album for nearly a decade. In case it isn't clear, the album is split into four discs meant to be played simultaneously. Difficult for the best of bands to be pulled off, the result is a wonderful, dynamic enveloping sound.Due to the sheer amount of time put into this album, nearly every sound, word, and note has been planned. The music in Zaireeka is exactly as the artists intended. Wayne Collins and the rest of the Flaming Lips can no longer be considered to be a ""drummer"" or ""guitarist""; none of them are restricted to one instrument. They play the music studio, in essence.This album lead to both Soft Bulliten and The Boombox Experiments, their wildly succesful concerts involving forty stereos."
3,ZAIREEKA by The Flaming Lips,Luckily modern technology has come into play in order to listen to the CD the artist wanted you to...
4,good service,"The toy arrived in a timely manner. It was ordered for the foster child we sponsored for Christmas. The only disappointment was that the product was indicated as new. While it was evident the product was new, and was still in the box. The actual box had some minor damage. However, I doubt the little boy would notice. But the adult would."
5,The Best To Date - This Choir keeps making Magnificent Music,"My favorite song on this CD is number four. It is incredibly powerful and a strong rendition of some hymns from the past. It's always good to have a healthy dose of the hymns that give us our roots. As long as we have strong roots in Jesus and in those things (such as this music) that drew us first to God, we can face every day! Don't pass this up!"
3,Terribly sad,"Books about war are used to be sad and this one is an example. The IRA playes the leading part in this book about the civil war in Ireland. Michael is a good bussinesman, he is the manager of a hotel but what if he has to choose between your wife, life or lover? Imagine yourself running away and hidding all the time because of one decision you have made and this turned out to be not a very positive one for the IRA.Brian Moore is telling the story very exciting and you will be reading the book from the tip of your chair. Unfortunately I do not like books about the was very much, but if you do I think you would like it very much!"
2,ok book for non professionals,"book is ok,it is a good reference for the everyday home cook. too bad the school only cares about making money"
1,HORRIBLE HORRIBLE! DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!,"I had a cheap set of Chicago Knives that were working fine, but the wood handles were getting a little worn (I am tough on knives, dishwasher, etc....) So I decided to buy these babies, they were in my gold box for alot less than I see them at now. Well, after I received them, I noticed that the blades were very dull. The sharpener is a joke. They don't feel like knives, the handles are very heavy. They are so dull, that when I try to slice a tomato, it just turns the darn thing into puree. Anyway, the best knife I have right now, (which I will never ever give up) is my one and only CUTCO. It cost me a bazillion dollars, but I leave my cutco in the EMPTY space that is in the Sabatier wood block. That is the only reason this item gets a star, because of its EMPTY slot (it came with) for my CUTCO."
2,You get what you pay for!,"I just received my ...14 piece Sabaiter knife.... The knife set looks good and cuts meats and vegetables satisfactorily, but it is most certainly not a [list price] knife set. The first time I put a couple of the knifes in the dish washer, they came out with rust on the blade. That should not have happened, oh well you get what you pay for, enjoy your new knife set."
4,You get what you pay for....but they are worth the money,"Yes, they are worth the money...given the price. But make sure you dry them completely, otherwise you get rust spots."
3,A lot for the money - but steel quality marginal,"This 14 piece knife set has everything you need in terms of knives. The handles are comfortable and the blades are sharp. However, I agree with others who have commented on the rusting. If you don't completely dry these knives before placing in the drawer or dish rack on your counter, they will get rust spots. Obviously, these are not made with quality ""stainless"" steel. But, for ($4) you can't expect that either. So, if you want knives that will last a lifetime, look elsewhere."
3,"3 Stars for your money, not for the original cost.","I purchased this knife set. Its good, its sharp and sturdy. However its not a fancy looking knife like some other popular brands. This is a plasticy handle with a sharp blade. I am a bachelor and its fine for my uses. Buy it for price and not for looks."
3,"Great story, cheap version","I ordered this book mistakenly expecting it to be a board book--but it is actually very thin cardboard. I am afraid I will tear it up, much less my daughter. There is no way this book will survive a small child handling it! Wonderful story, just try to find a better made one!"
2,Kind of disappointed,"I've bought this book hoping that it will be helpful at teaching my son about different textures. I've bought the soft cover bound book and it is very, very flimsy. It is made cheaply. The diffent pieces of fabric could be a little bigger for babies' small hands. It's too much of a hassle to return, otherwise I would have gladly returned it."
3,Pat the Bunny,"My daughter enjoys this book from time to time. I, on the other hand, can't get past the smell of the flowers in it. I gag everytime I get near it. The book is somewhat bland. I wouldn't really reccoment it to buy."
2,Don't buy the boxed set - Just buy Pat the Bunny,"Pat the Bunny is great, but Pat the Cat and Pat the Puppy are poor copies. Their activities are not as toddler-friendly, and I wish that I had only bought Pat the Bunny."
1,"Great Story, plactic comb format not good quality","The default selection for the book was for the plastic comb format at $9.99. I did not notice that there were other formats available at the time, and should have investigated a little more regarding the purchase. The picture for all the formats is the same and did not provide indication that they were different. After receiving the book, I was a little thrown off since it did not look like the one in the picture, but did match the plastic comb description. I would not recommend the plastic comb format (binding) to anyone that wants to read the book while their child turns the pages, nor anyone whose child likes to ""flip"" through pages of books on their own."
5,There's a reason why this book has staying power...,"Before I owned this book, I never really understood its allure. It seemed like it wasn't really brightly colored enough to hold my daughter's interest. Boy was I wrong! She has loved this book from the time she was about 8 months old. She's now almost 2 and it's still one of her favorites. She especially loves the little hole representing the mummy's ring and always wants to put her finger in my ring too. The one problem with the book is that it's not at all sturdy...but then again, it is quite well loved."
3,Both my children loved this book,My three year old still reads his copy that he got when he was a baby. My second baby received one when she was 8 months and also loves it. I just wish they were more sturdy. It's a wonderful book but my kids are a bit rough and have torn it to shreds. They have other touch and feel/lift the flap books that are much more sturdy. I think they should keep the storyline but re-design the construction.
4,One star off for the plastic comb format,"I thought about getting this book for years before actually buying it. Wish I hadn't waited - it's absolutely adorable! Completely interactive - every page has something different for children to do. Not just a ""feel the textures"" book, this one has your child playing peek-a-boo, smelling flowers, putting their fingers through a ring, looking in the mirror, reading ""Judy's book"" (yes, a book within a book), and of course, feeling Daddy's scratchy face and patting the bunny. At the end, the two kids wave bye-bye.Just a great book. My 10-month-old loves it and actually cries for it. She can do most of the things (won't smell flowers yet). Even my 3-yr-old wants me to read it to her. The only thing wrong with it is the plastic comb format. The book is so delicate, so fragile, that we have it stored up high in its box (which was stepped on already). I think my baby could demolish the book in about two seconds flat if given the opportunity."
5,Get your baby involved,"A friend gave this book to my son for his first birthday. At first, he didn't mind it at all, since the cover is in pastel colors. But soon after, it became his favorite book! He does all the tricks ahead of me, like patting the bunny and putting his finger in the hole. He just loves it! We read and play with it at least 5 times (yes, 5 times, i memorized it already!) each time he picks it up, which is at least 2 or 3 times a day. Instead of just reading to him, get him involved with books. And this is the perfect book for the job!"
1,Nauseating perfume,"I'm not usually sensitive to that sort of thing, but the perfume in this book made me gag. I had to put it away because I just couldn't stand to be near it."
2,Not a board book!,"Being a book for babies, I was not expecting it to be so flimsy. The book is bound with a cheap plastic spine and looks as if it will be torn apart within hours of gifting. Also, the ""mirror"" is very poor quality, the baby definitely won't recognize themselves in it. If I had seen an actual picture of this book, not just the cover, I would not have made the purchase."
3,Technically hard cover,Its a hard cover yet still has the spiral comb binding that comes apart. Does have two bonus pages that my daughter loves.
5,"Adorable, Fun and Educational!","This is an adorable book that toddlers just seem to really love, it's been around for years but is not dated at all, my nephews loved Pat The Bunny and I think it helps wih sensory perception and memory and I highly recommend it!"
4,Worthwhile,"This is a very nice CD bringing rarely recorded music to the public. However the critique of the Arutiunian concert which appears below is correct. This performance doesn't move the listener. The recording to listen to is for sale on this site and is called ""Trumpet Rhapsody"", with Timofei Dokschitzer. Now that's a great performance!"
4,"Stimulating ideas, beautiful ideas","I have found this book full of ways to help my students improve their work. After reading this book I spent 6+ hours carving fonts I have printed from my computer, stuck them on clay and carve the excess clay away. Shop signs for a pottery town! Labels for herb pots, naming a mug, using letters as artistic decoration, naming their work, writing a poem, a favorite phrase, lots of great ways to use the huge font range available to day. Write it in clay and it could last for 10,000 Years!! The ideas in this book show ways of using calligraphy as decoration. Yes there is not a lot of step by step for the beginner. The author has a strong background in calligraphy and has learn the principles, I have taught calligraphy, and hours of practice are needed to improve your strokes."
4,Steve Earle rocks 'cause he cant be stopped...,"I loved Copperhead Road....but after that I lost touch....ya I got The Hard Way...but it was the last thing I heard..years went by....in and out of jail...from drugs....I guess he got out....but I didnt by a cd till now.....El Corazon.........its 2 years old..but shines....damn..brother...hes back and sober...like nothing youve ever heard......I write poetry myself....and get jealous of his stuff.......its mellow,,,then you hear Taneytown....hard,,,,country...and N>Y>C>..... ...his son plays guitar on Here I Am.....its almost grunge.....but Steve walks out with a great tribute to the legend....(who died in 97) Townes Van Zant..with Ft.Worth Blues... screw MTV......Steve Earle....is beyond that... and more...he is one of the few poet/rockers left....so go buy this cd.....and lets try to never listen to Garth Brooks again....hes not anything..im a heavy metal fan......but Steve Earle....is just too damn cool not to listen to."
3,Grace and Family,"In the novel Grace Happens by Jan Czech, the daughter of a famous actress gets to spend a summer on Martha's Vineyard. Away from the sets and the spotlight, she hopes to have a normal vacation and learn more about her family. Grace is a likeable character. I'd recommend this story to middle schoolers rather than high schoolers. Grace's choice of words, her actions, and her reactions made her seem much younger than the age she was supposed to be, fifteen. Still, the book is cute and clean. Worth a read."
5,Excellent video!,If you like Aretha you will love this video!All tracks have great picture quality. Sound is HI-FI Stereo in all songs. Videos are complete. No cuts.Don't hesitate! Buy it now!
2,Good cover but bad creased plastic cover inside,"Only the cover is of better quality, but the plastic cover for the cards are creased and of bad quality"
4,Business card file,Very nice heavy duty business card file or holder. Very happy with this product as you can keep your cards in one spot when you want them and it is made of quality material.Was shipped to me in a timely manner also.Thank you
4,ANYTHING BUT ORDINARY,"This is a great christmas cd if you are looking for something different from the typical christmas songs, andyou enjoy country music. It isn't my favorite christmas cd, but I do enjoy it and listen to it every once ina while. It is relaxing and inspirational."
1,DO NOT BUY,"THIS ALBUM IS A VINYL RIP IN A VERY BAD QUALITY, I DO NOT RECOMMEND IF YOU CARE ABOUT SOUND!"
3,This was an okay cd,The girls in nadanuf are cool cuz they are a two female rap crew and uncool cuz they lyrics arent the best.
3,Dwindling the mood for reading..,"the series are damn great..the games are cool but when it comes to the books..i think the story's a little slow and uninteresting...to be precise...i really don't think the writers of the Buffy book series should put up longer plots to make the book more appealing since I think it really dwindles my mood to read the book. However, the settings and characters are immense and totally coincide for each circumstance in the book. Keep up the good work and I definitely think there are remedies to rectify the error."
5,Will hold a Canon 5D3 w/ 24-105,Amazing little tripod that I carry in a small pack. Make sure the lens is oriented in line with on of the legs.
5,Great Mini!,This is a great mini tripod if you don't need something really big.I use it for taking photos off a desk or off the top of my car.
1,Too little game theory and too expensive,"I had heard good things about this book but was left frustrated. Given the march of game theory over the past 15 years or so, I would have expected this to underpin the book's very word - but not a bit of it! Despite a nice section on auctions, the author tries to emulate existing texts (including previous editions of his own book) and does not take into account current developments in microeconomic theory. My other gripe is the price of the book. I am still hunting for a suitable text."
5,Awesome!,"I bought this tire cover last year for Father's day & it still looks great after being on the back end of a Jeep Wrangler all summer, fall & most of this winter. It was super easy to put on, and fit's a standard spare tire, but if in doubt check the measurements on the tire, it should be printed on it. The logo still looks great, no fading or peeling, and the black is still shiny, no holes or flaking off. It washes clean in the car wash, and we have yet to loose it on the road. A great buy!! He was VERY thrilled to get it!"
1,"""Greek"" is a massive disappointment",I bought it. I heard it. I hated it. Josh sounds awful. Looks like everything else has been said by everyone here. No use in being a parrot. Except to say it's going back!
1,DUH.....Nasal is Nasal,"Josh Groban's ""apologists"", would have you suspend your need for good music and a decent voice, and buy off on THEIR comments that anyone who is disappointed with this concert DVD is lacking in something. Well, there are over 250 reviews here and the overwhelming amount have the ability to hear!! They also have a discerning taste for good music. Include me in that number. This concert is so lousy it isn't even laughable. It's silly."
4,"the CD of the set is missing the song ""MY DECEMBER""","Watching the concert on PBS was the first time I have heard of Josh Groban. I thought the concert was excellent so the DVD was a must for me. However, I am very disappointed that the CD version of the set did not include the beautiful song ""My December"". How could they possibly not include it??? Hopefully they will make a studio version to release in the future."
2,Not a good avenue for Josh Groban's many talents,"Josh Groban has such outstanding talent and produced a beautiful first CD with an absolutely beautiful first concert CD that I rushed out to buy ""Live at the Greek."" What is obvious to me and from what I can tell, a majority of people who bought ""Greek"" is that this is not a worthy second concert DVD. I didn't read the reviews here on Amazon first, nor do I care what others have to say. What I DO care about is how I spend my money and that I feel good about my purchase. This Concert is poorly done and not because of anything else but Josh Groban's voice. He gives it a try but in 3 songs his voice fails. Since Groban's only real talent lies with his beautiful voice, this is a major disappointment. As far as whether someone buys it based on my (or anyone else's) review, I hope not. I just hope that they buy it at a store that gives refunds. Just in case!"
2,"No Excuse for ""Greek"" problems","I watched ""Live at the Greek"" on my HDTV and taped it during the first PBS showing. My tape recording has Josh Groban as nasal as they all report here. I do NOT have the DVD. The defective DVD excuse is one I don't buy because (let me repeat) I don't have the DVD. I'm giving the concert two stars because of Groban's obvious problems and the fact that he does sound decent in a few songs. To give this concert any more would be too much of a stretch for me. If I actually paid money for the DVD-CD set, I would drop the rating to one star. I would also be standing in line to get my refund."
2,What has happened to his voice?,"I bought this before I watched the PBS special---that was free and I'm somewhat disappointed in the dvd.Has he had voice lessons that are making him use his voice in a different way? If he is, stop it. He's ruining it! There is a warble to it on the long notes. He was so much better on his earlier CD's."
2,Massive Disappointment from Josh Groban,"My husband's sister's brother's kid bought this DVD. We all went to four concerts and paid massive amounts of money, which of course makes us very fair in our evaluation of this concert DVD. It's always a good idea to come here and dismiss other reviews and reviewers (up to 300 of them) because I like the guy. So here goes. I was massively disappointed with Josh Groban's ""Live at the Greek"" DVD set. I read over 300 reviews and noticed that the first ones were from ""Grobanites"" who gave 5-star reviews BEFORE the concert was aired or released for sale. That of course is fair and impartial. So Anyone who does not agree with this is not????Tough.Hundreds of reviewers here repeat the same issues that I had with Groban's performance. He's NASAL."
1,The Greek is a Tragedy,"I'd apologize for the pun if it weren't for the fact that ""Live at the Greek"" is no laughing matter. I paid $29 for it! I want to add my agreement in with the others that Josh Groban is ""nasal"" in a few of the selections on the concert DVD. Nope, it is NOT my DVD player or a defective DVD. If that were the case Groban's voice would sound that way for the entire concert. It doesn't. I'm sure this concert will satisfy the few thousand fans who want a momento of their concert experience (although a few filed poor reviews here too). For the rest of us who do not slug it out for a view or seat in a loud theatre, this concert was supposed to fit the bill. It doesn't. It only made me resolve to be very careful of buying any of Josh Groban's CD's in the future. Concert DVD's are out completely."
2,This one will be going back to the store!,"I watched my copy of Josh Groban's Live at the Greek for the first time yesterday and was shocked at the changes in his voice. I didn't read any of the reviews here on the Amazon website until I saw it for myself but I have to agree that I heard the problems before I came here. My description was ""congested"" and I read here that people are saying a ""nasal"" issue. Whatever it's called it's evident from the beginning. His voice is what set Josh Groban apart from any singer. What's also important to note is that all performers make their mark in their 20's. After that they just settle into a method. In the Greek concert Groban seems to be trying out every musical method there is including Classical, Pop, Rock, and Technical-New Age! He plays multiple musical instruments. Obviously those who attend the concert love it. I'm happy that there is a fan group out there and they're thrilled with the Greek concert. As far as for me, I won't be keeping this one."
2,"Josh Groban, Live at the Greek","I absolutely loved everything Josh Groban did in the past. His first CD and first concert were so beautiful it was hard to find the words to describe them. ""Closer"" was fine with a rare song in French, and the romantic ""My Confession."" So what happened here? The Greek concert includes so much material that was done in the first concert, but this time it's not done very well. Groban's voice is poor at times and great in others. In ""Mi Morena"" I heard the nasal voice, while ""Caruso"" is terrific. I also have issues with the camera work and staging. When Groban sings ""You Raise me Up,"" it looks like one kid in the choir is having a coronary, flinging his body and arms forward! Why did the film crew think we wanted to see all this? Everything is over the top except for Groban's voice. Bottom line...the Greek is a major disappointment."
1,No Josh!,"Let's have the old Josh back, his first DVD is splendid compared to this one, too much noisy females and too many shots of the audience. His voice sounds really bad, this is not worthy of his past efforts. His best songs were Mi Morena, Remember when it rained and Believe. I unfortunately prefer the Secret Garden version of You raise me up and I encourage people to seek out their album 'Once in a red moon' to hear the definitive version of this song"
2,The Concert is still on PBS stations,"First, let me say that I am Josh Groban fan. I didn't see him on Ally McBeal, but happened to watch his PBS concert a few years ago. That was when I bought everything I could get my hands on. At last count, I have 8 copies of Josh Groban CD's. Okay, now comes the difficult part. I saw the ""Live at the Greek"" concert this past Friday and what a difference! For me, it wasn't a good difference either. Perhaps he was worn out from a grueling tour schedule but it was a poor choice to wait until the end to record it at the Greek. I've decided not to buy this Concert. However, I'm really looking forward to Josh's next CD. I'm sure his beautiful voice will be back on track."
2,Best if you Lower your Expectations,"Yes, you can tolerate Josh Groban's ""Live at the Greek"" concert if you do NOT expect to hear him sing well. You'll be dazzled by his performance if you do NOT expect a concert worth watching. You'll love it especially if you think paying a lot of money for a lackluster, sloppily filmed concert is just great and grand. Then you'll be happy. Unfortunately most people who pay bucks for a concert DVD actually expect these things and more from a singer. Hence the overall low reviews."
2,Groban's Greek concert on PBS,"I consider myself one of the lucky ones because I watched Groban's ""Live at the Greek"" concert on PBS before I decided on buying. While watching it I was stunned by Groban's poor voice and sloppy looks. All the flashy lighting, screaming females and loud drum solos in the world can't mask the fact that Groban's singing at the Greek was less than good. Lucky for me I saw all this during the televised concert and decided not to buy this DVD/CD. I didn't watch more than 40 minutes of it, and this was free!"
2,Josh was much better in Person!,"I also have all of Josh Groban's CD's and I went to two of his live concerts. I bought his ""Live at the Greek"" DVD set and also noted that his voice was not up to his usual standards. He was very nasal in many of his songs. I agree that this is not a good release for Josh. He is much better in a studio or see him in person! I didn't like this DVD. However He is absolutely wonderful in concert."
1,"Josh Groban, Live at the Greek","He could have done a terrific concert, but this time around Josh Groban didn't. He could have sounded terrific and won over a legion of new fans but this time they're not even buying this mess. While two songs sound pretty good the rest are crappy and full of a nasal twang that even the worst country singer in the world would envy. Yep that's Josh Groban for 2005. A laid-back dude with a warble so bad it makes you wanna wince. Check out every site that sells ""Live at the Greek"" and the sales are so bad it's amazing. The reasons for poor sales are not of course. People saw the concert on TV and realized it wasn't worth buying.Groban had TWO nights to do a decent recording but didn't. That's TWO attempts but we still get this poor excuse for a concert. It's bad stuff alright and people aren't buying it. Good for them."
2,"Not like the ""Josh Groban-In Concert""",This dvd was not up to par with his previous one. I kept comparing the credits on both dvd's trying to find out what changed.
2,What are they doing to Josh?????,"omg, what are the people doing to Josh????? What's happening to his voice. I'm a teen (not a kid) and I can hear how he's straining. It's terrible to see Josh work so hard but sound so sick. These people should leave Josh alone to rest his voice instead of throwing him out night after night. Yeah, and they should really have filmed the concert on a different day. This is really just a bad day for him. He's a beautiful guy and he's better than this stupid dvd. Everytime i see Josh on tv he's great. So this is just a bad time for him. and they could have kept the cameras on Josh more instead of the screaming women. geez.....thats really gagworthy."
2,Disappointing.,"After seeing Josh in concert last summer (which was fantastic, even though it was outdoors and rained the ENTIRE time) I expected the performance on the DVD to be as flawless. I was disappoined. Josh doesn't sound like Josh in this concert. His voice doesn't have the emotion and power it usually does. Maybe he was sick? At first I thought, maybe I just don't like the DVD because of the annoying fans and lack of focus on Josh, so I switched to the CD. Worse. When I listen to Closer, I always get chills, but all I got from Live at the Greek was a disappointment. If I were you, I would buy Closer and go to the concert. This DVD doesn't make the cut."
2,"Josh Groban, Live at the Greek","Wish I could give this concert DVD 5 stars, the way I have for Josh Groban's previous recordings. The truth is, it isn't worth more than two stars. His singing is good to poor. His performance is good to poor. That's equal to a two star performance. I have all of Groban's CD's and DVD's. This one cannot compare. There's no quality here. That's why I returned my DVD to the store after only one time watching it. If the low ratings (hundreds of them) sound repetitive, it's because everyone can hear and see the issues Groban has during this concert. He ain't a saint, he's a performer. That's his job and he gets paid very well to do it. Groban's ""Live at the Greek"" performance was worthy of every poor review here, including mine."
2,"""Live at the Greek"" : Poorly Done!","I can't help but add my poor review to others here for Josh Groban's newest ""Live at the Greek"" DVD set. I bought it hoping to enjoy a second concert by one of my favorite Pop singers, but I couldn't bear to watch more than the first 30 minutes. Groban's voice was so poor and the concert was so badly filmed I kept fast-forwarding to see if it would get better. It didn't. It looks like being on the road, doing concerts, has affected not only his voice but his personality. It's one thing to appeal to the hoardes of women who religiously attend his concerts and yet another to appeal to the masses who buy the CD's. As you can tell from the reviews from the concert audience, they love it, while the rest do not. Groban's voice is very strained and it has a devastating affect on any enjoyment for the rest of us. I decided not to keep it, and returned my DVD also."
2,Josh Groban the MAN,"Is Josh Groban is changing permanently into what I saw in the ""Live at the Greek"" concert DVD or just trying new styles? As such a young, relatively new performer on the scene can he really afford to do this? Well, when it comes to me and my taste the answer is an absolute ""NO"". I didn't care for his performance on my DVD set and I didn't keep it. I returned it to the store within the week of receiving it (a gift). Josh Groban wants to mix it up, that's certainly his decision. Oh and by the way, it's his performance, his voice, his decisions that make this concert. It's not anyone else's fault. The fact that people aren't buying it, is squarely on his shoulders. If my son can go to Iraq and get shot at to defend his country at the ripe old age of 22, then Josh Groban can take reviews like this one while sitting in his ritzy digs."
2,pbs,I saw this on PBS and dare I say: Josh didn't sound that good. He always sounds perfect but this.. aaah his voice was just .. shaky. Nervous? Maybe. It's not worth the buy. Just listen to both studio albums.
2,"Returned my ""Greek"" Concert DVD","My ""Live at the Greek"" DVD was returned to the store yesterday for a refund. When the clerk asked me why I was returning it I said ""He sounds awful."" The woman looked at the package and told me they got quite a few of them back! I was shocked because I consider myself a picky customer. Then I came here to the Amazon site and saw that I'm not alone even in national opinions. This doesn't make me ecstatic of course because I love Josh Groban's voice, I just don't like it in the ""Greek' theatre. The other stuff like his looks, changes in style, etc., wouldn't matter much to me if he sounded great."
3,A few good,"I liked 'Remember' on the album, the others seemes a little over done, though that may be due to the fact that it was a recording of a live preformance."
1,Josh Groban should pay ME,"Groban should pay everyone who bought this lousy DVD a trauma fee, and that includes ME. Unfortunately I bought it quickly and in a store that does not give refunds. I used to love Groban but he has worn out his welcome, and his vocal chords, in pursuit of quick fame. The price is a dear one and his voice is going downhill.Oh, yeah. I want to listen to this stuff in SURROUND SOUND! What planet is the previous reviewer from? Also, what kind of vocal lessons does he/she take?? Can't hear the nasal sound?? Must be tone deaf. What a hoot!! It's so obvious.This DVD is terrible."
2,Live at the Greek is Not Josh Groban's Best,"I bought this concert DVD-CD combo and it pains me to say that this is definitely not Josh Groban's best work. It doesn't even come close. For those of us who did not attend the live concerts (millions of fans), this is a different Josh Groban in appearance and singing style. But that's not my biggest issue with the concert. It's actually the voice. The thing that made me such a big fan, is that beautiful voice. When I watched the DVD for the first time, I heard a congested (yes, ""nasal"") voice. It wasn't on all the songs but definitely there. There were songs that I enjoyed when Josh was able to get better control, but not enough for me to say that it was worth the money I paid. When he sang with the beautiful violin I saw a glimpse of how well he performs with others and she was beautiful."
1,So Disappointed,"Fortunately, I watched this concert on PBS before deciding to buy it. I have seen Josh live a few times during the past year and am surprised to see the decline in his vocal performance. It is sad to see this happen. He should go back to his roots and work on the quality of his voice, which appears to be missing in action lately.His voice has been nasaly and inconsistent over the past year and appears to not have improved."
1,"Groban's ""Live at the Greek""","Josh Groban's concert, ""Live at the Greek,"" is quite awful. The way I see it, I saved a lot of money by buying it from a store that gives refunds. After seeing it only halfway through I returned it for a full refund. Later in January I was in a Barnes and Noble bookstore and they were playing it in the store. One woman turned to me and said the singer was really nasal. I just smiled because I was one of the lucky ones. A friend couldn't even sell hers to a re-sale store. They had too many copies already. If you're thinking of buying the DVD set and haven't seen the concert yet, think twice before you buy. At the very least, go somewhere and hear it first. You have nothing to lose but your money."
2,Groban's Voice doesn't impress,"Josh Groban's second concert, ""Live at the Greek"", is not his finest moment. The man with the golden voice seems to have trouble maintaining the strong vocal power throughout this performance. After watching the concert I decided not to buy it. What Groban needs to do is rest from an obvious overwhelming tour schedule and get a new voice coach! When a singer sounds ""nasal"" it really means that he's straining. Any professional can spot it. It's just puzzling that this concert was recorded with Groban having such obvious problems."
5,Beautiful pictures and a lot of great information,"We bought this book for my son to use for an animal report he was working on for school. He enjoyed the book and the pictures very much, as did I."
4,Family member,"This book is very interesting and is about the hardships of Arctic exploration. The book is the published diary of Edgar Vernon Christian who died of starvation with the entire party during an Arctic expedition. It was published by Lt-Col, William Francis Christian."
2,A disappointment,"Perhaps I expected too much because of the author's name but there is not much more to this book than ""you should get a life, and appreciate it""."
3,Harmless with strong title and bad language.,"A girl in Uruguay falls for a Spanish pimp and has some bad experiences in Barcelona.The story rings true, and one wonders if the Spanish financed it to curb the immigration of Latinamerican prostitutes. Practically no nudity, minimal actionscenes make this the most harmless documentary of the ongoing TRAITE DES BLANCHES.The language is foul but correct for the milieu.Entertaining if the subject interests you, but expect no thrill."
4,Shakespeare and Kids!,"I used the Hamlet script out of this book to produce the play with my fourth graders and they ate it up. They couldn't put it down and understood what the play was about. I like how it still uses Shakespeares words and style but in a simplified way so that children will understand it. I enjoyed it a lot, and would recommend it to any who is daring enough to try Shakespeare with kids!"
2,Complete disappointment,"As fan of hispanic literature. I have read stellar writing from arthur's such as Federico García, Lorca, Ocativo Paz, Miguel Hernández, and Vicente Huidobro. Blas is shallow throughout his book, I felt as if Blas is looking to find himself. Blas needs to mature as person and a writer. My recommendation skip this title."
2,Ground breaking? Tell us something we don't already know...,"Shapiro calls Prom Queen a ""study"" of women.... I call it a compilation of gossipy, egotistical, self-centered, whiny women who have nothing better to do than sit around comparing and complaining. This is not the the ""truth"" about women.I have no problem meeting intelligent, witty, introspective women who actually formulate solutions to their problems instead of sitting around wallowing in them.A sad, sad, sad, stereotypical representation of women....."
5,Enjoyable series...,"If you are into this region of the world and its music, world music, ethnomusicology, or music education in general, this series is a wonderful introduction to musical cultures. My professor at college is using this for a Global Music Education class/multiculturalism in music. Great model for educators."
5,I love this product!,"I've not seen Encarta before so I have no idea about previous versions. However, this version is very impressive. I'm a computer professional and I can say that very few products have a user interface that 'flows' this well. My primary reason to get this was for my 10-year-old, but I think I'll be using it a lot more than her. The maps, dictionaries, articles, and links to related content on the web are great, but how they are all tied together is what really makes this product shine.It does take a while to load and you want to install everything on your hard drive (about 2Gig). If you don't load everything to your disk then you'll wear out your arm swapping between the 5 CDs when you look at different articles."
3,A nice little Britpop gem,"Quite often Oasis offshoots will get lost under the radar, but Hurricane #1's self-titled debut hovers a bit higher than generic Britpop. Formerly of Ride, Hurricane #1 is Andy Bell's baby, brash riffs and lush guitar precision dominate the CD, occasionally falling somewhere in between Fools Gold's distorted funk and southern rock plucking. The percussion is straight out of Madchester, dancey rhythms similar to The Charlatans UK first few albums (along with the occasional organ) meeting Liam Gallagher-type vocals, yet more toned-down and a little less sneer. If you're searching for Britpop that's not bland, Hurricane #1 throws 70's classic rock, mid 90's Britpop, and Madchester all together and makes it work. You can't go wrong."
2,Mediocre at best,"The patterns in the book are very limited in creativity. Many seem to be basically the same pattern with minor changes. Very difficult to substitute yarns. Also, pattern sizes RARELY go beyond 38-40 inch bust (in the women's patterns). Directions are very difficult to follow as well. They'll say to change to smaller needles, then you'll be working through the pattern, line by line, and they'll say to switch back to the smaller needles again...was I supposed to have switched to the larger at some point? I've searched and searched and have been unable to find an eratta anywhere. I won't send back, mostly just to avoid the hassle of the post office, but I would strongly urge you not to buy. So many other books that offer so very much more for comparable price!"
5,100 Knitting Projects,This was a great find. There are a variety of patterns and all look great. Makes you want to start with the first one and make them all.
1,EZ Connect Turbo a scam,"This network card should be called NEVER CAN CONNECT UN-EZ TURBO. From the first time I loaded the driver to the last time I want to load the driver,after speaking countless hours to the smctechsupport, I wasn't able to get this junk working. The connection is very unstable. The 1133 feet connection is a joke. I moved 5 feet from the router and my signal becomes..LOW, and don't even try to move further than that, because you will loose your signal. My recommendation- DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT, and pass this along to your friends."
3,Great Format and Quality,"Would have been 5 stars if not for the huge percentage of African and African American material. I have nothing against it, but my interests are more diverse."
3,not bad not great,"If you are involved in this series, you'll want to read A Fine and Bitter Snow to keep up.If you're new to the series, don't bother with this book. Go back and read the earlier titles.We have Kate much the same; still needs to get over herself, otherwise the same stuff you've enjoyed in the past. We have Chopper Jim moving into town. Fine. He'll need to be closer if he's going to replace Jack as Kate's next interest; and, as Kate is behaving exactly the way to Jim as she behaved to Jack just before she admitted to herself that she was involved with him, we can take this as read.The book is well written, if the plot goes nowhere. There is some nice Alaska info stuff throughout."
3,A Transition in the Series,"This is the 12th in the Kate Shugak series of mysteries set in Alaska. In this outing, Kate is back in the Park, winter is upon them, and she is beginning to emerge from her self-imposed cocoon. When two of the park's long-time residents are killed, she teams up with state trooper Jim Chopin to find the killerI've been a big fan of Dana Stabenow since her first Kate Shugak mystery, A Cold Day for Murder. This is not one of her best. There's too much description and not enough action. There's not much plot - what there is takes place in the last 60 pages of the book.It's more of a series transition - moving Kate from mourning Jack to a new relationship. It is as if the author had to meet a deadline for a book and this was the result. Stabenow's heart didn't seem to be in this book. I'm hoping that this really is a transition, and not the beginning of the end. I hope Stabenow will be back in form in the next Kate Shugak book."
5,Exceeded my expectations day one,"Floundered with Adobe Photoshop Elements 2.0 for over one year. Finally got to the point that I was totally dissatisfied because I couldn't do a simple red eye fix easily. Decided to invest in another digital photo editing package. After reading for 2 hours choose MS Digital Image Suite 9.The first 30 minutes that played around with the package, I could do more with it than the 1 1/2 years with Adobe. This package is very intuitive. I was accomplishing edits and special effects that I was never able to do with Adobe."
4,good program for the money,"I have had this program for at least 2 or 3 years. I personally love it. I tried other products and for me you really need to be smarter at computers than the average Joe to use them. I have honestly truely enjoyed this program a lot. It's easy to use! I don't feel like I need to be a rocket scientist to figure it out. You can edit your pictures, do all kinds of projects like cards, building frames, etc., and much more. I would recommend it, especially for people who are not computer geniuses."
1,B-O-R-I-N-G,I tried to like it. I really did but I wish I never wasted my time with this. Fly by Night is way too long and way too boooooring!
3,Got defect one. I needed to replace it. Beside it's good set.,Got defect one. I needed to replace it. Beside it's good set(original from Garmin).Amazon's replacement system is quick and easy (if you have printer).
4,Garmin Acessories,Kudos first to Amazon for having the product in stock. I looked many places and they didn't carry/have it.The product itself works fine.
3,Ok for the price,"Used for my 3 yr old son's room. Was expecting more of a sticker like decal. This is basically like wallpaper. You have to wet the glue on the back and you can remove them easily, but they can't be moved or repositioned. They look pretty good once they're up, though."
2,dissatisfied; was sent incomplete set; not what was advertised,"> I received what was suppose to be my order in terrible condition! Seller enclosed a note along with a personal check because ""seems to be missing a piece and ends are a little crumpled."" I ordered TWO NEW COMPLETE SETS of 5 wallies. One set was missing 2 pieces and one set was missing one. So I didn't even recieve ONE FULL set! I recieved two incomplete sets in one flimsy package. I was charged $10.98 for shipping and I noticed they only had to pay $3.55 for the terrible packaging that I recieved. I asked (and received) a full reembursement of $32.96. (The amount I paid for shipping as well as product.) Not only did this product not meet my expectations but it was not the product they claimed to be selling. This was not new or complete."
5,Beach Scene Mural (wallpaper),"I love this and want another one! I placed mine in the bathroom on the door, and now I have a wondow to look out and see the sea and sand! It was easy to put up, and I would use these in every room in my house if I could afford it! I have compliments each time someone see it, and the sand dollars and starfish you can place anywhere, they are separate.""5 STARS!"""
3,pretty picture but very wrinkled,"The picture is very pretty but the item arrived folded in several places. Upon unfolding it to smooth it out, the points of the folds were slightly torn. I smoothed it out as well as I could and then pulled it tightly in a picture frame. I contacted the seller about the wrinkled condition of the picture and they responded that if I used it as wallpaper that it would not be a problem. However, I bought it to frame, not wallpaper."
3,wish planets had different adhesive,"I redecorated my son's room with these planets, and they look fine, but the adhesive is wallpaper adhesive so you have to dunk it in water to get the decal to adhere and then it is basically permanent. I was not expecting this and had hoped they would peel on and off. Plus I had difficulty with the adhesive on about 7 of 10 decals and had to use a wallpaper seam glue to actually get them to stick, so they are now for sure as permanent as wallpaper is."
4,Great Score!,"I was, as others will state, dissapointed with the first X-men score by the late Michael Kamen. Not that it wasn't good, it just lacked thematic material and use of it. It worked it the film wonderfully which is what I guess, was meant to do. Aside from the film, however it didn't work as well. That aside, the X2 score was wonderful. It workes both ways and has a wonderful powerful theme to it. Allot of the music reminded me of the two Star Trek scores that James Horner scored, Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan and Star Trek III: The Search for Spock. I guess that makes since because the ending of X2 is similar to the end of Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan. Also on the DVD for X2 John Ottman talkes about how he was trying to make the score sound similar to that of Star Trak II, so there you go. I say if you love epic scores, and you love the X-Men movies, buy this now. It's truly great!"
3,Disappointed To Say The Least,"I had really high hopes for this album I must admit. Being a owner of almost hundreds of movie scores, its a genre im very familiar with and enjoy thoroughly. X3: The Last Stand gave me the listener a very rich experience and allowed me to go through a very distinct journey. There were highs and lows and Epic pieces to the music. I had always remembered that X2 has been a music score I enjoyed with the movie itself but could never get my hands on the score. Once I finally made the plunge here on Amazon, I must say that im not satisfied with it at all. Same goes for X1 (I purchased both together). Neither really offered a similar theme to build upon. Both seemed to work great with the movie but as stand alone pieces, im very disappointed. Something like X3 or Transformers or Pirates of the Caribbean or Star Trek are all just such superior pieces of music in my mind (comparing them to other Blockbuster type music)"
1,Need TO Lose The Subtitles,"I would not buy this movies again.The movie itself is good but no matter what I tried,I could not get the subtitles off of the screen.This is more than likely how the dvd was made.I have several other movies in which the subtitles disappear after going into the dvd player options.The tv version is better without alot of talking and music physically appearing on your tv screen."
4,Stallone in Spanish OLE',I have no idea what any one in this movie was saying. All I know is Sly sure can wrestle armstyle. Also I had no idea Stallone was a spaniard. Color me surprised. Long live Stallone and his big powerful arms.
3,Boyfriend Love This,"My boyfriend came across this movie while looking up old movies on Amazon. When I ordered it, I didn't remember much about it. It sure brings back a lot of memories once you start watching it!"
2,Not enough light to read by in a tent,"This latern is very small and light and you can set it up on uneven ground. It would be fantastic if it were a bit brighter. As a tent light, it is enough light to see by, but I can't read by it. It simply does not have enough LEDs. I had hoped to use this latern instead of my small Gear Guide battery powered LED lantern which is much bulkier. However, I have gone back to using the Gear Guide lantern instead because it gives a brighter light and the batteries last a whole lot longer."
4,Good toy,This game is a good game but it isn't that hard to beat. It seems that it is not rated very high as a chess player. I still enjoy it and I will try different openings to try to get different ideas of playing chess. If you are looking for a stronger game I would not reccommend this game. I would find one that has a chess player rating of 2000 to 2700 yet still play a relatively easy game at the lowest level. You are probably not going to find one like that if you don't play against it prior to purchase and I don't think anyone will give you a trial period. I probably would purchase it for a brand new beginner but probably not for someone who has played chess for a few years. I would not purchase it for a high rated player of 1500-1800.
3,It's alright,I actually like that it juices fast and you don't have to force your veggies or fruits but what I hated is that the pulp comes out kind of wet. I would of liked my pulp to come out dry but that didn't happened.
2,I wish I could like this juicer,"I became interested in juicing when my daughter-in-law demonstrated her Bella juicer to me. After researching and reading customer reviews, I settled on this Breville model. It's not getting much use. It does a fine job on carrots, and a good job on beets, but with leafy greens and the fruits I've tried (pears, apples and peaches) it produced around 50% foam instead of juice. While the foam can be consumed, it has a very unpleasant mouth feel and ends up in the compost bin. This is a lot of wasted fruit and the money to buy it. The juicer, while easy to clean, has turned into an expensive dust catcher on my counter top. I'd never recommend this model to friends unless they planned to process only hard vegetables."
2,Poor quality juice,"I bought this juicer because of all the good reviews. Like a few other people say: the pulp ends up very wet. The blade runs so fast that it actually does not juice the entire vegetable/fruit. It juices half of the fruit and spits the other half out into the trough. I've wasted my money buying this juicer. I really don't understand why almost 400 people think this is a great product. I just giving it 2 stars instead of 1 because I don't think the cleaning is a big issue. I am not very fussy about juices, but definitely, it does not make the job."
2,I wouldn't buy this product,"I am on a cleanse juice fast and have the Breville Juice Juice Fountain. I do not recommend the Breville Juice Fountain Juicer because #1 it throws chunks of apple and vegtables into the pulp collector so some of the produce never gets juiced, and #2 it has some sort of air blower where the juice comes out and it actually sprays juice over the counter, which makes it messy. What I do is juice my apples and vegtables, then wait for the centrifuge to stop spinning, take the top off, and then try to scoop out the pulp and un-juiced produce and put it back in the centrifuge and rejuice it. IT IS MESSY AND A WASTE OF TIME. I would not buy the Breville Juice Fountain. Guess you get what you pay for."
5,Very pleased!,"This arrived today and I am very pleased with it. Very easy to set up, easy to clean, and I did not have any problem with juice dribbling to the side of the cup. I did have one small piece of grapefruit skin fall into the side of the pan, but the rest was just pulp.... I found the pulp to be very dry and did not feel like it could have squeezed a bit more juice out of my mix. It was easy to clean although it does require some effort to scrub the mesh pan around the blade. I was especially happy with the compact size of this unit compared to some of the units out there. I used Kale with several other ingredients and found the motor to be very powerful and able to handle it quite easily. Glad I decided to order it. Definitely worth the price!"
4,great product!!,"I bought this juicer after reading several reviews on it and other juicers. This juicer is definitely worth it for the price that I paid for it!! The clean up isn't as bad as I was expecting, the filter brush/cleaner that comes with this product is perfect and makes the clean up a lot easier. In terms of amount of juice extracted I think it does a pretty good job (although I have never owned any other juicer so I have nothing to compare it to). I would say that the fiber/pulp left is mostly dry...maybe a little more juice could be extracted but it does the job. It is relatively small so it is nice for my apartment kitchen. The lock feature is great because the juicer will not turn on unless it is properly locked (good designing). I would recommend this product to a friend!!"
1,Not what everyone says it is.,"I ordered this juicer because I didn't want to spend $200 plus for a better one. Well, I really wish I should have because this juicer is NOT what everyone says it is. It is NOT easy to clean. I had a cheaper juicer that wasn't even meant to be a juicer, and THAT was easier to clean than this. I used it only once and it stained the juicer orange from the carrots. Granted, any juicer is going to stain but not as fast as this one. After just one use, I returned this. If you're into serious juicing like I am, then don't get this, don't waste your money. Save up for a good one. That's what I did. I am definitely going for a BETTER juicer. If you're only going to juice once a week or less, than I would say get this one but definitely not for juicing daily."
4,Love iT!,"I bought this in Sept. and been using randomly for a while and it worked perfectly. Juice very fast and quiet. But unfortunately, with any juicers, it still leave some wet pulps behind. Otherwise, no complain :)I choose this over the Lalanne juicer anytime."
5,Great juicer!,"I chose this juicer because I have very limited space in my kitchen. The size is just right, and it's a very efficient juicer! Very fun to use, and it has successfully juiced citrus, carrots, and all manner of difficult fruits and veggies. I have no complaints! Also, very easy to clean."
4,Great product!,"I am new to juicing and bought this juicer about a month ago. I chose this particular model because it had great reviews and was in the price range I wanted to spend for being new to juicing. I am very happy with it. I juice about 3 times per week and it is a very quick process with this juicer. It is easy to clean and pulverizes veges and fruit in seconds. The softer leafy veges I usually wrap around something harder like a carrot or celery and it seems to work fine. I also think the froth separator works well and keeps most of the froth out of your glass if you dont want it. The pulp is slightly wet, but not soaking wet, and keep in mind this is my first juicer so I do not have anything to compare it to. Overall I am happy with this purchase and the only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I have nothing to compare it to. I would recommend this to a friend."
3,Great reasonably priced juicer! But...,"This is a great juicer for the price, it does what it's supposed to do. Unfortunately it doesn't always do it great. Lots of time I purees the fruits or veggies and you don't get much juice from them. What I've taken to doing is re-juicing the pulp probably about 3 times. So while it works great, it's a lot of work! Don't let the title of it being compact fool you, this is a pretty good size appliance.So if I could go back and purchase a juicer again, I would probably try and invest a bit more money so I could buy one that works more efficiently. If you are on a budget as I was when I purchased it and have the patience and time to re-juice the pulp, it works great."
4,Good juice.,"I bought this with the intention of going on a 10 day juice fast. It ended up lasting 7, but I'm glad I did it. The taste of the juice certainly took some getting used to. I've found that Apples, Pears, Lemons, and Ginger (and I'm not much of a ginger fan normally) help a lot to handle the taste of green juice. On the 8th day I passed out...perhaps I wasn't drinking enough juice, or my blood sugar was too low. I'm not blaming the juicer for it, since I was not taking any food or anything else along with it."
2,Breville Juicer,"I bought this from Amazon a while ago. It is large. takes space, and time for cleaning. So end up in cabinet although it does the juicing. Fibres were filtered. So juice does not have fibers. Juice is smooth and fine. Not practical for daily use. Small blenders that has containers to carry and run is better and cheaper too."
4,great juicer for the price,"I received this juicer as a gift on christmas. I was skeptical at first because of a few bad reviews concerning the food caught in the pour spout. So far I haven't had problems with that. I wash all the pieces right after I make juice and use a baby bottle brush to clean all the pieces. I use the nipple cleaner end of the brush to clean the spout that is ""hard to clean"". It works just fine. The motor is very good and the pulp is not too wet. It's very easy to pull apart, clean, and put it back together. The only thing that is an issue for me is the pulp trap is internal and I prefer it on the outside. The blade is strong and sharp, but the screen seems somewhat flimsy. It's shape is a bit awkward so it could take up a bit of space. Besides that i think it's a great buy for the price."
4,Juicing a new way of life.,"I bought this product based on the reviews of others at this site, and I am very happy with it.It is easy to clean, and operate.The matter of juices seems to be a hit or miss thing.You have to experiment.My first try was like a V-8 knock off, with 10 different veges in it.I was pleasantly surprised to taste that it did not need salt! It was amazing!There is a difference in quality when you are using organic fruits and veges.As for the machine itself, no problems, just pure juicing joy!"
5,Better then expected!!,Its been about a year since we have purchased the juicer and we a still very happy with it. Build quality is excellent and it removes about 30% more juice then our previous owned juice-man Jr! Also great price!
1,Failed after about 2 hours of use,I bought this unit for my daughter. She never used it. It sat around for about a year when i got my hands on it. After two uses the motor failed. Unfortunately it was too old to return.
2,$45 Replacement Filter,"Great juicer. However, WHEN you need to replace the mesh filter, as the tiny blades eventually wear out and are easily damaged, it will cost you half of what you paid for the machine!"
2,Pulp was very wet...,"I was very excited to buy this at first because of all the great reviews on it. But when I received it and used it, the pulp that was left behind was very wet and had chunks in it. With the price of produce being so high, it felt like I was just throwing my money away. I was very grateful for the free return. At least I was able to get my money back."
3,Just Ok,"I purchased the Juice Fountain as a novice juicer and was not aware that the all excess of the vegetables went to an inner container in the juicer. Needless to say, this causes a HUGE mess to clean up each time and if you are juicing for more than one person then you have to stop and clean it out and then start again. What a PAIN!! If you are a single juicer then it is fine if you don't mind the mess of cleaning out the inner container. I actually went and purchased another juicer, one that has a side container and allows me the ability of juicing for more than one person at a time without stopping. Something to think about when purchasing a juicer."
4,SuperPower,"This product model should be titled Volcano or Tornado. The juicer is very powerful and does a great job extracting juice. On the negative side: the motor has to be running when you insert the fruit and veggies. It's an eruption that escapes the cover, so carrots, apples and tomatoes splatter some particles about the kitchen. The side benefit is the kitchen gets a nice clean-up on a routine basis."
4,Quick & easy,"This machine is fast and easy to clean. My only complaint is that sometimes with certain leafy greens they fly out before they can be used, wasting valuable greens. Other than that it's a great deal!"
5,Love it!,"This juicer is super easy to use and easy to clean. It must be cleaned after each use (especially the basket with the included brush!). It rinses easily, then a warm, soapy wash, rinse and air dry is sufficient. It is top shelf dishwasher safe, however the large top piece is too tall for my dishwasher. I can usually juice two recipes before needing to empty the hopper. I've found the pulp to be very dry! I do peel citrus fruits and waxy veggies (like cucumbers, removing the seeds also). I core my apples too but otherwise the whole leaf veggies, carrots, fruits, etc. processes very efficiently. It is a bit loud, but given what it's doing...I'd guess so. :) I LOVE IT!"
5,Awesome!,I am very happy with this juicer. It is super easy to clean! It makes juicing easy and fun. I highly recommend this product.
3,Juicer,"I like this juicer, but I almost wonder if I should not have ordered the Jack Lalane Juicer. There is way more pulp that there is juice with this juicer. I noticed that on the Lalane commercial there is hardly any pulp. It also spits out of the top, making the use of my juicer a little messy. It does work well as far as power and it looks nice, but I wish it juiced more in comparison with the pulp. I am ok with this juicer, and I since I have never used a juicer before, I cannot really compare mine to another."
3,Good juicer,I have been using this juicer for 6-8 months now mostly making orange juice. Here are some of the PROS1. Extract good amount of juice2. Large chute allows drooping whole oranges3. Relatively easy to clean though too big for dishwasher and takes about 15-20 minutes to clean whole thing specially you have to scrub the mesh grill with the brush provided.Cons1. Slight amount of juice leaks from sides and some time some juice seeps on top area where Motor is.2. Did not perform well with carrot juice may be i did not use it right but i put whole carrots and it did not extract much the pieces of carrots were ejected with the pulp.Overall a good purchase and am happy with it.
4,Very good product for the money,I purchased the 850W version of the Breville.I am very satisfied with this product. It lives up to the claims I read about. The machine is easy to clean for a juicer but the screen on any of them is a pain. Finally an intuitive way to integrate a hook on the plug for easy removal from tight new sockets. I would recomend this product to others.
5,Amazing!!,Such a great price for such a wonderful piece of heaven. Very affordable and yields mucho mucho juice. Love it!!
4,great juicer but some spatter,"This is the first juicer my husband and I have bought and we love it. We're very impressed with how quickly it juices, how dry the pulp is, and how great it separates the pulp. The reason for the 4 stars however is because of spatter. Whenever you try to juice anything small or ""juicy"" like tomatoes, strawberries, blueberries, etc, you end up with a lot of spatter. Before you can block the opening with the push can, it has already got your walls, your shirt, and (as I discovered today thankfully before company came over) your ceiling. Despite the effort to cleanup the spatter, it's a breeze to clean and store. It's a bit loud and was larger than we expected but compared to other juicers, it's a small size. Great for the price!"
5,I love this juicer!!!,"I am in love with this juicer! It is quiet, quick, easy to clean, and reasonably priced! Its amazing....try it!"
3,Breville BJE200XL Compact Juice Fountain 700Watt Juice Extractor,"I'm not too happy with it and have expected better results. The juicer is waisting a lot of material, even so by juicing very slowly.Herbs etc., even packed inbetween apples are not getting juiced well enough and end up mostly whole in the waste-container.There is simply not enough juice contraction. Something else I don't like about it: It is recommended to turn on the motor firstbefore entering food, which means, the food is splattering and jumping around in the compartment, while you are trying to addsome more to stop this from happening.I don't hate it, but I'm definitely dissapointed.It also takes quiet some time to clean it well."
2,"Wastes time, wastes vegetables","I've never owned a juicer before, so I can't offer a comparison between this and any other model. I can say that this takes about 15 minutes to clean after every use, one serving of juice consumes about $5 - 7 worth of vegetables, and probably about half of all the vegetables put into it are wasted with no juice extracted. An enormous mass of vegetable pulp is left over even when juice is successfully extracted. Compared to simply eating the vegetables and drinking water or tea, using this machine is stupendously wasteful."
2,Don't waste your money,I bought the Breville based on the reviews. I must say that I am very disappointed with my juicer. It leaks all over the place and causes a nasty mess. It also starts to diminish the amount of drinkable juice with every use. Not a fan.
5,DISHWASHER UN-SAFE,"I bought this for myself and I used it nearly everyday. I placed it in the dishwasher and when I cleared the dishwasher out I found that almost all the plastic pieces had MELTED! My machine which I loved read ""DISHWASHER SAFE""...I have had no other dishwasher casualties before or since...it is obviously not dishwasher safe!"
1,Decent juicer that made me sick,"While this makes for a pretty good low end juicer, this product (with only 3 months of use) started to make me sick. The plastic under the bottom of the blade was chipping off, though I did not realize until I found large black pieces of plastic in my juice.At first I thought this was a fluke. It's gotten worse and I finally had to stop using it because I grew nauseous after juicing (a reaction from the plastic, of which I was finally able to make the connection).It was a decent juicer while it worked but it made me sick. Just be careful and check the black plastic under the blade. If it starts to fall apart, send it back."
5,Great appliance,"I spent a lot of time and energy researching the best, not too big , not too expensive, somewhat stylish,efficient juicer. This on just fits the bill! Fantastic juicer , easy to use and to clean. Highly recommend it!"
5,"Great Juicer, Great Value!",I've had my new juicer 3 days and I think it is awesome.Easy to use and easy to clean.Great Price too!Much better than the jack LaLane Juicer I had a few weeks ago.
4,So easy to use and clean!,"I have had this juicer for a few months now and really have no complaints. I've been juicing multiple times a week and usually do veggies and leafy greens. I haven't juiced much fruit yet, but don't anticipate any problems. This machine is very powerful, very efficient and very easy to clean. The only complaint I have, and it's a very small one, is that the juice spout doesn't flip up to avoid dripping on the counter when you've pulled the pitcher out to pour into another container. Not a big deal though. Overall I love this machine!"
4,Perfect Buy!,"Loved it! Easy to use, great price, easy to clean and loving trying different types of juices! I'll recommend it highly to purchase..."
3,"It's an OK juicer, but it could be better.","This is my first juicer. And when I juice, I make more than 32 ounce of juice at a time because I don't wanna clean it everyday. So, I get lots of pulp. And I hate having to stop and then dig out the pulp then tossing it out. There are times when whole pieces of fruit/ vegetables just don't get juiced. They go in, and then spun out and unjuiced. Hopefully I can try out my cousin's juicer soon because she has a masticating juicer. I haven't tried other ones before, but if I could redo my order, I would've gotten Breville JE900 Juice Fountain Professional Juice Extractor instead because the pulp is separate from the juicer and more easily disposable."
4,True Love,"4.5 StarsI love this juicer. It cleans up very easily and is easy to use.The only complaint I have is that the pulp is wetter than I would like, meaning that I am missing some juice."
2,not built for daily juicing,"I have been juicing 2-3 times a day for 3 months with this juicer and the mesh grinder/filter is falling apart. I think this juicer is great if you are going to use it a few times a week but if you plan to make juicing part of you daily routine this juicer is not going to meet that task. Or at least not the mesh filter...which will need to be replaced somewhat frequently.I just ordered the champion professional model.Again, if you are going to make juicing part of you daily routine I would highly recommend spending/investing a little more and getting a juicer that is going to last."
4,Juicer- Great,"Very pleased with this juicer. Make sure that you clean it after every time using it, no exceptions. So far this model has been a very good buy."
2,DISAPOINTED!,"I BUY THE SAME MACHINE IN OTHER WEB PAGE FOR MI SISTER IN LAW AND SHE WAS VERY HAPPY, SO HER MOM WANT OTHER FOR HER, MY HUSBAND AND I BUY IT THIS ONE IN HERE AND I THINK THE MACHINE WAS DEFECTIVE BECAUSE THE MACHINE OF MY SISTER IN LAW CAN CHOP A CARROT VERY FAST AND ALL THE VEGGIES, BUT THIS ONE CAN'T, THE MACHINE JUST CHOP THE HALF AND THE OTHER IS ROUND AND ROUND INSIDE THE MACHINE, I THINK IS SOMETHING URONG, SO WE SEND IT BACK!"
3,Not as much fun as the Xbox version,Being a fan of the console version I thought it would be nice to have a portable version. Unfortunately the movements of the characters are really hard. I found it too hard to navigate the cat-walks and found myself blasting my other team member more then the Storm Troopers. It's too bad more thought wasn't put into this game before release as it had a lot of potential. My son has the GameBoy advance version ofLego Star Wars II: The Original Trilogywhich he seems to enjoy so I would recommend grabbing a copy of that if you really want a portable version of this game.
1,Glitches for All!,"This game is the most glitchy game I've ever played. In most games, you say, ""Whoah, look! a glitch"". But in this game if you ever get some amazing stroke of luck you may be able to say,""Yeah! No glitches!"" but that will never happen as every level has a glitch that often times will trap you and not let you finish or the game will actually freeze and you will have to turn it off and start from your last save point. If you get this game, do not expect much, and save OFTEN. But it would be best to save your money and get a good and well planned out game like Star Fox Command, Mario Kart DS, The New Super Mario Bros., or Eragon (Yes, Eragon is actually a GOOD game made from a movie!)."
5,Great Hiding Place,I bought two of these coral caves to add more hiding places in my freshwater tank. Currently a crayfish occupies one and the other has had numerous tenants (lol). This product will add to the character to any fresh or salt water tank. I will recommend this product anytime. Great Buy!!!
3,"""He's got my badge. Could you get it for me?""","*That was one of the best last lines ever said in a movie!I saw this on MST3K(hence my nickname)and it was one of the worst ones I have ever seen(made for a funny ... episode). A stupid plot(portly sheriff who says ""Son of a..."" a lot goes to Malta for no reason), bad acting, and shoddy scenery. Seems strange that a movie this bad is on DVD. If you like to see a movie where a main character gets out of bed in the same way over and over, and where a man gets shot TWICE in the same scene, get this movie. Or else you can watch it when it reruns again on MST3K.PS: One star for how bad it is, another one for Best Brains for having the guts for air this, and another one for them making fun of how bad it is.*=sarcasm"
2,Racism in a sterotypical small town,"As with anothe reviewer, I really wanted to but could not finish ""Heartland"". This work is derivative of Nelson DeMille, who did a better, if even darker, job with much of the same theme in ""Spencerville"", which is probably DeMille's weakest effort to date.Basic plot: Wounded ""hero"", returns to the immediately apparent pettiness of his small town roots. He's full of self-doubt and self-pity. The town bullies from high school are still there. And the usual accessories: Pick up trucks, grain dust, steroids, lost love, the good-hearted sheriff, beautiful, enabling and abused women, divorce, gangbangers moving in from the big city, and physical threats. Guess what goes wrong.We've read all of this before. Books like this make you understand why people move away from the rural comforts of Nebraska. Instead, I just looked elsewhere for a good read."
2,Didn't Like,"Couldn't even finish. This book was simply too boring for me. None of the characters were interesting, including the main character. After Becker, no one compares. It's hard to believe that after such a long wait, this is what Mr Wiltse gives his fans. I won't give up though. I'll see what he does next. Recommend he bring back Becker."
4,Cheaper than new dishwasher,"I ordered one kit....worked great,but need another kit to finish the job.. Dishwasher racks, top and bottom, needed major surgery...unless you are really strong, clipping tines with dikes almost impossible....I ordered 5/16 "" capacity bolt cutters.and glad i did....even given expense of two repair kits and bolt cutters, still much cheaper than a new dishwasher."
4,Quick to install,"A few of my dishwasher prongs were just starting to rust. Package came with complete instructions. Do follow them closely for best results. Glue drys quickly, like it says. Too soon to tell how long they will last. Have done 2 loads and none have come loose.Some specifics, since when I was looking around, some reviews said they fit and some didn't. Looks like inner diameter of the cap is 5/32. My model is a Frigidaire FDB1050REC0.Buy the caps AND THE GLUE. The instructions tell you that you must use the glue, otherwise they will not stay on. But the description on the website doesn't tell you that."
2,"Despite label, not for all skin types","Nice packaging but worked a little too well on my face--it ended up feeling striped and dry and consequently oily later in the day as my skin worked to balance itself out. Ingredient list indicates it contains alcohol and sulfates, which might explain why it wasn't the best for my oil prone skin."
3,Great tuba playing; bad recording,"Roger Bobo is one of the great tubists. The sheer beauty and emotional content of his playing on ""Westwood"" and the technical virtuosity of his playing on ""Yellow Bird"" are worth the price of the album. On the last two cuts, he plays Bass French Horn--and where else are ya gonna hear that?!Otherwise, however, I was immensely disappointed in the overall quality of the recording. Everything's a bit quiet and muffled. The arrangements seem very dated (to the '70's). I kept wishing that the guitar, piano, etc., would just shut up so that I could hear the tuba. The first track's melody is irritating and sticks in your head."
2,"Same old, Same old.","I usually only write reviews when I have postive comments, but I was disappointed in this years version of Encarta. It has very few improvements or new features.Although the content will always remains secondary to the real encyclopedia publishers. I always enjoyed seeing what new flashy features Microsoft has come up with... (and 10 new videos was not good enough for me).There is no question that this is the best functioning encyclopedia (at least if you are using Windows and other Microsoft products) but without any new flash... and considering the nature of the content I can not recommend anyone purchase this product (and will probably see if I can return mine)."
4,"Great product, a little bit over priced","It is amazing, it looks nice and it's big, the fan has lots of fins that takes considrable amount of air out.The quality of plastic is not super, but certainly it is very good.The fact it is made entirly from see-through plastic has two advantages:1- The LED light reflects more.2- You can tell when the inside of your fan needs cleaningThe reason I gave it 4 stars is that ""personally"" I feel this product price should be between $10 - $15 maximum. Being sold at $20 (plus shipping and/or taxes) makes it a little too much for just an exhaust fan.But at least, it DOES the job well.UPDATE:HAHAHA <--- just wanted to give a laugh at my self, I bought the fan 3 weeks ago for $19.99 (total cost was $21.22) and now when I received it and just after writing this review I found the price dropped to $15.38!!"
3,Garmin 301 Personal GPS w/Heart Rate Monitor,"This product has been somewhat disappointing because it will not give a total elevation change. I use the product mostly for bike riding, and that was a piece of information that I was expecting in the after ride read out."
2,Not a reliable GPS unit,"Unit has a hard time acquiring, then is not accurate on distance or speed. Expensive heartrate monitor is what it is for me. Good for recording several workouts but nothing more."
4,Great Value and Good Information,"I purchased this item to get a definitive measure of how fast and how far I was running. It met my expectations and is a pretty neat tool to have as a runner.The downside is that it is a bit bulky being a large display (which is good), and the save functionality is awkward. But if you use the software to track your running, it comes out ok.Great value for the benefit."
3,Save Your Money - Wait for Strays,"I've been a Jane's fan for 14 years now, seen them live several times... Love them - my favorite band on earth. But... If you haven't bought this CD yet, let me save you from wasting your money. This is stuff we've all heard before as die-hard Jane's fans - nothing remarkable enough to want to hear it again. The new stuff on this CD is flat and boring. Not worth it in my opinion. I give it 3 stars for people who just want to collect. I bought it and still have it, but never listen to it. Rather hear the old stuff. Can't wait for Strays though - from what I've read, it's going to be incredible. Out July 22nd."
4,for the true fans,"In a time where Celine Dion and the Backstreet Boys dominates the charts, Jane's Addiction reminds rock and roll what it should be, dangerous This is a series of outakes and live recordings that gives a small example of a great band. Not as complete as their earlier albums. And the new songs, with the exception of Kettle Whistle"" are a little weak. For a first time listener I would recomend ""Ritual de lo Habitual"" or ""Nothing Shocking"" This album is for the longtime fans who want a reminder of great times. Still a good example of what everyone in rock should want to be ""..beautiful too"""
5,"Great CD, Better price!",Of course I love this particular CD! it was a favorite of mine in my late teens early 20's! Now that I have kids I wanted to show them what real talent sounded like! This Album is almost as good as I remember it and it brought back some great memories! Thanks Jane's Addiction!
5,One of the best text book courses on how to read Tarot Cards,"I bought this book when it first came out, over ten years ago and I still have it. It's one of the best books you can buy on how to read the Tarot. This one really gives you alot of information, and it also gives you a great step by step plan for learning it on your own and even spaces to draw your very own deck. You also get plenty of wonderful Tarot spreads. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn to read the Tarot. It's fun and informative and great for beginners and more advanced students. It feels just like having a private Tarot Tutor."
3,He recorded it for his mom !,"Yes, that's true. This album features 12 standards from the 20's, 30's or 40's, complete with big orchestral arrangements. It's very hard to review such an album. It will surely be dismissed by people considering that ""it's not rock, it's lousy"". It's not rock'n'roll indeed. And Ringo isn't Sinatra either. But that's almost what makes this album interesting, hearing Ringo doing his best to sing these songs. And it can be really charming sometimes. ""Sentimental Journey"", the title track, is really well-arranged. And in a way, I'd rather hear Ringo than some great crooner singing that kind of songs because he doesn't take them too seriously, he just has fun singing it, so we have fun too !"
1,Terrible,"This band could be hardcore. But they just suck. They're boring; the vacals are crap. This is more like wimpcore, and this CD is terrible. Listen to hatebreed if you want hardcore, cuz these guys totally blow."
3,mediocre,"Decent enough, but it's obvious some members of the quintet are more skilled musicians than others. The trumpets are decent but not stunning, the horn and trombone are excellent, but the tuba leaves something to be desired."
4,Good cookbook,"This is a wonderful cookbook. However I have 2 points of criticism.One: it should not be called ""the Russian Cookbook"". I am Russian & most of the recipies in the book I have never heard of or definitely never tried. It seems that most of them are from the Southeastern republics of the former USSR (Georgia, Armenia, etc). And their food is very different from Russian.Two: most of the recipies in the book will take you a while to make & will require certain level of experience & equipment availability.So if you like Middle Eastern cuisine & have a lot of time for cooking you will love this book! The recipies are good."
4,Please to the Table,I bought this book as a gift for my boyfriend. I have the same book in my home and use it often as my mother was Russian and I remember all the wonderful food she used to make. It has good recipes and since my friend is of Swiss and Russian origin and a good cook he really appreciated it. The most often used recipe by me is during Easter when I bake Kulich (Russian Easter bread) and make the cottage cheese spread called Paskha. Thumbs up!
1,Disappointing,"Whenever a saxophonist tries to record all of the standards of the repertoire there is usually a clunker in the set that just isn't up to the standards of performance. On this cd, every track is a clunker. Harvey Pittel is the single most over-rated saxophone player I have every heard. He brings out nothing in the music, his tuning is shameful, his technique is vulgar and his articulation is a disgrace. I really don't know what people see in this man. Don't try and compare him to a bunch of the other shoddy performers who felt the need to record yet another mediocre reading of the Creston, Ibert and Maurice. Listen instead to Emmanuel Pahud perform the Ibert flute concerto and compare that with Pittel's performance of the saxophone concertino by the same composer, he just isn't close to the level of musicianship and technical perfection demanded on every other instrument today."
5,Excellent book. Well thought out arguments.,"Excellent book. Well thought out arguments without the partisan rhetoric or emotional diatribes that are so common in discussions about healthcare policy. The book presents PRAGMATIC, LOGICAL arguments to consider when discussing the US health care system. Unfortunately, no one who makes policy will ever read it or follow the advice therein. LOL. The American public doesn't respond well to logic or pragmatism, and anyone who comes up with a logical policy will never be re-elected."
3,i only bought it because i was there,"man, reviewer #1's review was on. i only bought this because i was in the front row of the actual show. metal concerts in germany are sedate, to say the least. germans are so passive, they get all freaked out over thrashing and moshing. band interaction with the audience was minimal and they seemed detached. it was a daytime show, so that took it's toll on the overall effect. i also second the motion that chris barnes says some stupid crap on stage. who was he catering to, war protesters? is that a contradiction? should we give peace a chance, and stop listening to torture killer? maybe he better cut back on the pipe he smokes. buy double dead instead."
5,A Real Beautiful Mix,"When my mother first bought the movie, it was good even though I wasn't all that deep into music at the time. Yet the song that the film opens up to, ""Across 110th Street"" by Bobby Womack is an amazing song that not only captures what was taking place back then in the ghetto/urban streets, yet it still has truth in the current condition of the under privileged. The mixture of songs from Johnny Cash to psychedelic rock, is beautiful. This is a keeper for those that really just enjoy music. Oh and Brother's Johnson ""Strawberry Letter #22"" is off the chain!"
1,What a pity,"This is a fine sample of soul music, but it has been mixed and mastered so badly that it's simply unbearable. Sounds like a 10$ cassette player out of a wastebin. Pity!"
2,"very , very expensive for what it is!","If it was a 12 volt system or 120 volt system I could have bought the battery warmer for $40.00 at the auto parts store. The oil warmer with the thermostat is the tricky one . Fixed oil heaters or the screw in type run $18-45 .If I was not in a hurry I would be better off looking for a thermostat controlled oil block heater that screws in to drain plug that would run on a 12 volt DC supply. All yours for only $175.00The manufacture has the connections set at 220 volt, so to have it all plug in and work it needs to be a 220 volt system."
4,This horse fulfilled my wish,"I greatly enjoyed this book. It has plot, character development, especially the heroine who morphs from an uptight emotionally repressed woman to a highly sexually open minded one. The hero is gorgeous, their orgasms explosive and it has enough otherworldliness to make it different."
1,"""Best of"" is a stretch...","The disc itself is fine, but I sure seem to remember these guys having more than 2 decent songs (She's a Beauty, Talk to Ya Later). I should have just gone to iTunes and downloaded those instead of buying this CD."
1,PASS on it,"""The Best of the Tubes"" C.D. without ""White Punks on Dope"" and ""What do you want from Life?"" ! Is this a joke? Their 2 greatest tracks omitted from ""The Best of...."" DON'T GET RIPPED OFF! Pass on this, and stick it to their record label!"
2,Not for small Pills,This would be great if your giving your pet a big pill. I have to give my kitty a very small pill twice a day and the pill didn't come anywhere close to fitting on the end of the pet piller. It just didn't fit my needs.
4,Enjoyed this a lot,If you like Scottish romances this is right on track.Held my interest from begining to end. Would read more by Moore.Amazon is good about suggesting books they think I might like and for the most part are right on.Alberta
1,oh pleeez,don't waste your time or money on this...Actually J.D Peterson's music is where it's at...Buy RHYTHM OF THE DREAM!!!!
5,This is the best album since Abby Road,From the time that we put it into the CD player we werespellbound. The music rocks and has a positive message.I am getting a copy for everyone that I know that could use a good positive message.
1,No Grip,"I bought these bowls in hopes that it would prevent my grandson from pushing his food bowl onto the floor. There is absolutely no grip on these bowls. He could easily slide the bowl across his high chair tray and onto the floor. Not only that, he could easily pick up the bowl from the tray and throw it. I was very disappointed."
3,kind of junky but real hard to assemble,"I'm pretty handy but it took me no less than 11 hours to assemble more or less correctly. Screws are cheap and many break... some do not really even fit well. The fastening systems are a bit flakey. Overall, this is more expensive than it's worth, but a fairly functional modular unit. As far as price/value, it should cost about 2/3 of what it does."
3,THE END OF DAYS,"Writer/producer David Seltzer seems to have a significant passion for the Antichrist as evidenced in his hit movie THE OMEN and in this six hour miniseries from 2005.All the familiar territory from the Book of Revelations is included in this story of an astrophysicist (played woodenly by Bill Pullman, who is always better in comedy), who is recruited by a maverick nun (passionately performed by Natascha McElhone) to help her stop the birth of the Antichrist and to find the miracle baby who just may be the incarnation again of Jesus. Michael Massee is a despicable villain as Satanist Haden, who murdered Pullman's daughter and has now kidnapped his impressionable stepson.The movie benefits from its many locations and for the most part, the pacing is brisk and it's easy to get involved with the story. I wasn't too pleased with its nebulous ending, but if you enjoyed THE OMEN, you will probably enjoy REVELATIONS too."
2,Slow and Anti-Climatic,"I must strongly disagree with the current string of all five (5) star reviews. This mini-series started off with great promise. I too was riveted for the first two hours of the series. It was laboriously slow in the middle and did not deliver the goods in the end. In fact, there really was no end. Did we watch a five-hour mini-series to set-up another five-hour series? NBC is in obvious trouble since the demise of ""Friends"" and pulled out all the stops with a major hype campaign. I'm sorry, but they failed to deliver from my perspective. I own close to 1000 DVDs and would not put this in the library for free.Check out ""Taken"" for a mini-series worth investing your time in. I recently watched it on DVD and was pleasantly surprised."
4,Terrific Period Piece,"Had to be there.If you grew up in the 1970s, and you remember your mum or dad cracking up to this guy; then it's great memories and a few genuine laughs for you.This guy David Frye was the best at Nixon et al back in the day.If you can enjoy, relate, or just vaguely synch to the jive, the vibe, the tempo-of-the-times; do yourself a big favor and pick this up.Nearly impossible to find: the Bay, the Pirate, the List-- no one else but Amazon has it.Enjoy !"
4,Mark 1 Rocks Out,"Mark 1's sophomore album is even more intense and driven than their debut. It is edgy and progressive, and ultimately extremely satisfying. Each song carries its own weight and delights the listener with pulsing strains and electrifying riffs. Their instrumental work on this album is powerful and precise. I particularly was impressed with the breadth of this album and the use of unique sounds (such as mixing in the strains of a church organ with the electro-acoustic blend that powerfully works in this album). The mixing is very strong throughout. Props to the people at Abbey Road for their work on the album. Well done, boys...PG would be proud."
2,Do NOT listen to the audiobook version of this book.,"The story was predictable and uninteresting. It was difficult to keep up with the cast of characters due to the quantity of names used by Margaret Maron. Unfortunately I listened to the audio version read by C. J. Critt. Perhaps if I had read the book I might have a different opinion. Ms. Critt's reading of the book was difficult to listen to. She read as if she were reading to elementary school students with her ""overacting"" of the characters. Her Southern ""accents"" were an insult to all of us living in the South (I, myself, live in North Carolina where the story takes place). Some characters sounded like ""pumpkin bumpkins"" while others sounded as though they were plantation owners from the Civil War. When Ms. Critt spoke for Dwight, she sounded like more like Marge Simpson rather than the love interest of the main character. I do not think I will ever listen to another audiobook which is read by C. J. Critt."
4,How do women balance their lives? THEY DON'T!,"I have lent my copy of this book to 4 friends already, and even bought my former roommate a <Flux> of her own. What I liked most was that the author didn't try to make this book all things to everything: she only interviewed women who she considers ""Pace Setters:"" university educated and white-collar . Each woman has a distinct story, unique goals and hurdles. But similar themes are heard time and time again. ""How do I balance it all?"" ""Do I really need to be like men to succeed in the professional world?"" ""Do I have to be a mother/wife/hot-shot at work in order to have a full and pleasant life?""As an author, Orenstein gives us few of her own answers, and generously lets her subjects speak for themselves. And by eloquantly telling us their own tales, they reveal to readers that there is no way to acheive a perfect balance. We are all just struggling to do the best we can."
5,Great Book for Women or Men!,"Through examples of the lives of hundreds of women, Orenstein explains how women's ambivalence about choices they make in their own lives often comes from the conflicting messages we receive and hold about our roles in a post-women's movement society. Orgenstein points out that women have not yet achieved total equality and are therefore in a transitional stage. The ability to recognize the effects of this state of flux on one's psyche will help anyone, man or woman, make choices more in tune with their own inner wisdom."
2,Self-satisfied princesses wanting it all,"A very self-indulgent look at a slice of the spoilt American female middle class who seem, in this book, to be completely out of touch with what real life is like for most women - those millions who struggle every day with low income, low self-esteem, exploitative employers, debts, disability etc. The book was an eye-opener in that respect in that these women in the book will be, or are by now, shapers of policies 'for the rest of us' - God help us."
4,Great Book on the preparation of sermons,"This is a short but powerful book on the creation of sermons. The reader learns about different types of sermons, the source material for sermons, the mechanics of studying for a sermon, how to create a filing system for sermon preparation, the different appeals of sermons, 16 sermons, and much more.If you want to learn basic homiletics and read some example sermons then this is the book for you."
4,Great movie!,"A really riveting movie. Hillary Swank does a great job! I would highly recommend this movie, you will not be disappointed."
3,Could have been better.,"The story was great and the acting was good too. I just wish I could watch a movie with my wife or anyone else I know without being embarrassed by the language or the content (who needs to see a naked guy dance? - no thank you). Back in the day (early 90's) they used to edit movies for TV viewing. I believe they have stopped doing that. I wish DVD's had a ""family friendly"" version that would clean that up."
3,Conviction,"A very unique movie in which a mother of two slogs through recieving her GED,completing college and then law school all to free her wrongly convicted brother."
2,Price,"Somewhat informative, definately not worth more than $... quite honestly. The book is not specific or in depth by any means."
2,in depth,I read the book and it definately not worth the price. It is not in depth or specific by any means.
4,Isaiah's Messiah,"This book can be read in about an hour and a half. It begins by looking at some of the contravercy that surounds Isaiah chapters 52:13-15 to 53:1-12. It then gives a brief verse by verse commentary on these passages from a solid biblical view point. I had not read anything by Victor Buksbazen before, I will certainly not hesitate to purchase other books by him. I enjoyed it."
4,I have the movie wedding singer and i enjoy the music .,"Ihave the vedio of wedding singer i realy enjoy it and i like the music they play and i like the music adam sandler sings also, i think adam sandler is realy cool."
4,"Disco Days, all over again ..","Thoughtfully compiled tracks make this CD linger onto your 80's memories. Stuff you grew up listening to ! Misses quite a few tracks which seemed to have come in the movie, notably ""99 Red Balloons"" by Nena, ""Wake me up .."" by Wham ! An absolute must for the 80s freak ..."
2,Trunnion Boxes!,"111 pages, no gallery, black & white photos. The title implys a book on boxes but only two chapters are boxes, and I don't like his basic box technique, really it's a project book. It looks like a good book, step by step complete instructions, enough pictures, good ideas, but I haven't found it as useful as Richard Raffan books (check out his box & project books first). It is however the only place I've found a Trunnion box. Contents: Basic Tools & Techniques (11 pages); Projects: Pestle & Mortar, Small End Grain Bowl, Goblet, Scoop, Boxes, Rattle, Lace Bobbin, Trunnion box, Long spindles."
3,Harry Bosch Kindle novels,"All three novels are good reads. ""The Black Echo"" delivered to myKindle was missing a dozen pages in the middle of the book."
1,refuse to purchase until kindle price comes down,the harry bosch books have been recommended to me but i will not purchase them until the kindle price comes way down. i will not purchase the hardcover because i have a kindle and i want to read the books in the kindle format. period.
4,Ceremonious Hieronymus,"Read all 17 M Connelly Harry Bosch novels. These 3 as well written as any of the bunch. Excellent research into police investigative techniques; medical examination analysis, and, of course, Harry's(Connelly's)intuitive mind. I tried to read the novels in chronological order (based on publishing dates). Some holes in story surrounding Harry's and Eleanor Wishes breakup and then reappearing 4 years later. Disappointed that MC wrote Eleanor out of series and in the way it happened."
1,Junk!,"So bad I couldn't finish it- and for me that's saying a lot. Harry dully plods through these books, obsessing over his past, sleeping with his co-workers, and being a stupid lone gun. I gave 2 of these books a good try, hoping I might like one of them and I was rewarded with misery and frustration."
5,The Greatest Detectiver,This book completes the set of Michael Connelly novels that we have been collecting. I especially like Harry Bosch. Try him.One of the better mystery authors.
2,Not the best,"Really was excited for this scoop. I have two cats that fill up the litter box very quickly! And I thought that this would do the trick. But the scoop came bent up. I had to pull it back out to be the right shape. It was also much smaller than I anticipated. Lastly, it was more flat than I thought it should be. It doesn't have much depth to it to hold a bunch of soiled litter. However, it is sturdy and does help you dig through the ""tough stuff"". However, I was extremely disappointed with this scoop."
3,air bubbles,I bought what would have been a very nice heavy vase if it were not for the numerous air bubbles all around the blue area of the vase.I had to return it for that reason.
5,Great Game,"This is an awesome game. I don't want to be a pilot and I still love this game. It's compexed (like flying a real plane) and amazingly fun. There are something like 23,000 airports you can fly too and I don't think anything is sped up (Like if it really takes 1 hour to fly to chicago it will take an hour) I'm not sure though. You can act like a real pilot or go insane. One time I was trying to land at an airport, I missed it, tried to brake and my plane stopped like a mile from it. You can fly all over the world. There are also very very very informative lessons that teach you how to fly. Worth the money! Pilot or not, you'll love this game."
1,MS Flight Simulator 2004,"This is the worst flight simulator that I have ever used. I wanted to give it zero rating but was not allowed to do so by the survey software. It is not adequate for children or teenagers, and will be a large disappointment to anyone seeking a simulator that provides quick and accurate performance. Without any add-ons, it requires over 200 megs of hard disk space, which is too much for a good PC simulator, and causes it to bog down too much."
5,FS9,"A very enjoyable game. Once I figured out the settings to make it more realistic, I have used it to enhance my flight training. More realistic crashes with explosions would, of course, make it that much cooler, but that isn't the point of playing. Real time weather and realistic runways are helpful to practice on."
3,Flight Simulator 2004,"This game is addictive, & has a huge following.However, I have junked it, as it needs a very powerful computer, and high end graphics card to work well.One quickly gets bored with the default aircraft, and the scenery is blocky.If you can spend $3500+ for a good computer, and if you are willing to spend hours tweaking this game, and if you can afford to pay around $400 for add-on aircraft and scenery, go ahead.I prefer to use stand alone sims such as F/A-18 and Pacific Fighters, which work all the time, and have no bugs.If you wish to use FS2004 for Flight Training, there are much better options."
5,FS2004 Is The Greatest!,"I've been flying FS2004 for about 2 years now, and I just love it. I started flying sims when FS98 came out. It was ok, but I knew Microsoft could do better. The scenery was cheesy (especially the mountains), and the weather was anything but realistic. FS2000 was much better, but buggy. FS2004 has gotten most of the bugs out that hurt 2000 (I didn't buy FS2002). I love the weather, especially when downloading real-weather. And, the tons of add-on (freeware and payware) do make this sim ""As Real As It Gets"". I haven't tried FSX yet, mainly because I just don't have the computer power to run it properly. It's been getting some bad comments. Just remember that FS2004 also got bad press when it first came out. Now, almost everyone loves it. We just have to wait for the computers to catch up with the software."
1,it sucks,this game sucks. if you have a joystick and want to fly the planes good luck. the box was broken when shipped. if you have a pc it wouldnt load once it does you cant fly the planes have late reactions. the game is slow and graphics are horrible. if you have alot of money and want to waste it buy this product it was a waste of my time and money.
5,works as expected,Everyone thinks they need to buy the same battery when their headset dies but that is not always the case. Picked up the Lenmar battery for my headset. Battery arrived quickly and works as expected. Great price and much cheaper then the direct replacement. no problems so far.
5,An inspiring collection of essays,"I had never read any of these 11 previously published pieces before, so I really felt like I hit the motherlode when I chanced upon this collection in the local library. Scholarly, yet entertaining and compulsively readable; not a combination one often encounters. From Anais Nin thru Margaret Mitchell, Ayn Rand, Hannah Arendt and 8 more women, this book sketches an unforgettable miniature of each and even dishes the dirt with elan."
2,Packaged a little too neatly,"I was looking for a good Christmas story, one that I may enjoy reading for years to come at Christmas. Well, this was not it. It was way too cutesy for my taste. Not that I would not do cutesy at all, just that there should be some substance to a story as well. I picked this book up on a whim at Sam's Club. This was my first Macomber book and I don't think I'll be reading any others.Of course I expected a happy ending, but all of the events were just a little too perfect and I never felt much of anything for any of the characters.Although I didn't care for this book, I could see the story line being successful in a made-for-TV-Christmas-movie. Most good books don't translate as well into movies (particularly if you've read and enjoyed the book). However, maybe the opposite could be true for less engaging books."
4,STAR WARS WITH A SEXY DISCO TWIST,"I'VE USED TO WATCH THIS SERIES IN BRAZIL IN THE LATE 70'S AND IT WAS A DISAPPOINTMENT WHEN COMPARED TO STAR WARS (JUST ABOUT ALL SCI-FI SHOWS WERE, ANYWAY). HOWEVER IT HAD WHAT STAR WARS EPISODES LACKED (THEN AND NOW): SEX APPEAL AND SEXY LOOKS, WHICH BECAME THE MAIN ATTRACTION TO ME AS A TEENAGER. THIS SHOW, BY THE WAY, IS A GREAT EXAMPLE OF HOW DISCO CULTURE AND AESTHETICS WERE PERVASIVE AT THE TIME. PS:SORRY THIS DVD COLLECTION HAS NOT BE PUT ON SALE IN BRAZIL, FOR I DO MISS THE BRAZILIAN PORTUGUESE DUBBING."
5,Wonderful Characters & Great Love Story,"Like many of the other reviewers, I am a Susan Johnson fan. This book is one of her best. You can really feel the love develop between these two strong individuals. What begins as a sizzling lust grows to a caring and committed relationship. That Adam remains faithful and struggles to overcome his jealous feelings about Flora's past, made me love him more. Only one small complaint. I would have liked a little more explanation as to why Adam's father forced him to marry Isolde."
5,An excellent Tarot quick reference book...,"I was thrilled when I bought The Tarot Companion. Along with ""Tarot Plain and Simple"" by Anthony Louis and ""Power Tarot"" by Trish MacGregor and Phyllis Vega, ""The Tarot Companion"" is one of the three essential references I like to use when doing a reading.I don't believe any ONE tarot book is the answer to anyone's tarot reference needs, but this one is definitely a must have in my opinion. It really complements my vast tarot book collection. I like the fact that it provides an overview of the symbolism of the various images in the cards, numerology, astrology, cabalah, chakras, and more.The card meanings that it gives are brief and not in-depth, so I would not rely on it as my sole resource for card meaning descriptions when doing a reading. But overall, this is an excellent resource to have as part of any tarot book collection. For quick lookups, it's great. An excellent primer and quick reference."
5,The book with the beautiful voice,"Wonderfully real and inspirational reflections of therapeutic sessions with a therapist who seems to have the healing combination of genuineness, authenticity, self- and other-awareness, and the innate desire to really hear and see her clients. The words harmoniously sing from the pages of this book with the chorus repeatedly reminding us that in therapy it is indeed the relationship that heals."
3,It's nowhere near as good as Beach House 2 or 3,"It's perfectly acceptable and inoffensive, but it's not as good as the older beach house albums.If you haven't got 2 and 3, buy them first before buying this one"
2,Poorly constructed Netting,"The pond netting is not very strong. If you lay it on your pond, the sheer weight of the leaves and the ice will tear it down in fall and winter, It may be OK in the summer time preventing birds, deers going to the pond.It is a very light weight material good for protection of plants from the wild life.The merchant delivered the product as promised and refunded fully on receipt of my pond netting returned unused."
1,Product size is written incorrectly.,Amazon site claims the size asProduct Dimensions: 12.3 x 9.4 x 6.9 inchesBut in reality nothing is 12.3 inches. Diameter on top is about 5.5 inches.I am returning this product.
5,Blackwater Series,"I had to reiterate what the others who reviewed this series have stated. This is one of the best, if not the best, serial novels I've ever read. It's well written, scary, and fascinating. Well worth the time and you'll read it quickly. In regards to the person who asked about the 6 books being published as one, it was already done. I found the book in hard cover (2 volumes) at a yard sale and of course bought it immediately. I've never seen it in hardcover since, but am glad that I have it. My whole family passes around this story every year for a re-reading. If you want a good read, then pick up the Blackwater series. You won't be disappointed. If anyone finds it on audiobook, let me know. Michael McDowell has definitely left behind a story that will live on through those of us who love it and will recommend it to anyone who will listen. Thanks."
4,The best of Christian alternative:),"I thought this cd was fantastic. Though I miss some of the soft sounds from songs like April Showers and Truth from Caedmon's Call, I loved most of the songs.Even then ""Just don't want coffee"" and ""center aisle"" are good, just not their best. Their sound is wonderful and I enjoyed the variety of lead singers. I think their Christian beliefs shine through, but they appeal to anyone."
3,A generous three stars,"Seems like I'm in the minority here of thinking that this is somehow earth-shattering-ground-breaking stuff... for me, it's overall a disappointment. The Space ""Junk"" could be called something else, not suitable for print. There are a few songs that are reprised with more instruments and seem a little more lively and familiar the second time you here them - which makes me wonder why he didn't just do the whole album like that. As a whole, the album didn't excite me at all; it's sleep inducing. Nothing too memorable to make me want to jump back and play it again. But hey, it's still Jay Farrar, so hence the two and a half/three star rating...And here's a really big question of mine - if this cd came out with someone else's name on it (someone that we'd never heard of before), what would the reviews be then?? Probably not that good I suspect."
4,On Jay Farrar 's new CD,"i am definitely biased with jay as opposed to jeff, but even looking objectively at Terroir Blues, i have to give it at least 4 stars. great, grainy solos.personal favorite is Cahokian.this is real, true poetry in motion, dry midwestern tongues of torture, hope, persistant stalking, and mind blowing fall afternoons on the mississippi."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!,"I have been using computers since the late 70s. I build my own, I fix them for friends and family. I am competent with both hardware and software problems. That being said, I can't get this program to install. I called microsoft hoping for a hint on installation and they wanted $119 to help. Screw them. Buy anything else or get picassa2 for free.DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!"
5,Enya is awesome!,"This music is so lively, beautiful, soothing, cheerful, and good spirited. I love the combination of Irish and ambient music. The lyrics talk about the beauties of the world, the happy parts of life that conquer sadness, and independence. I've listened to this CD dozens of times and I still can't get enough of it! I wish everyone could have this CD."
5,wonderful collection!,I really enjoy this Enya collection but I think there are so many other great tracks....it's just hard to put all of her best work on one cd....A awesome collection to start out with if your not an Enya fan! This will give you a taste of what and who Enya is!
4,Heavenly and Inspiring,"Enya's music is wonderful and inspirational. What you get is a collection of vocals (mixed with technology of course) and it's perfect mood music. Therefore, FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO HATE MOOD MUSIC, IT'S NOT FOR YOU! Her lyrics aren't exactly that great or meaningful (most of the time I can't even understand the gaelic/celtic stuff) but the beauty lies in the sounds--the harmony. It's very mild, laid back, and dreamy.When you first listen to it, it seems that all of her songs are too similar (a common criticism). But if you have the patience to really spend time to listen to it, you'll see that each song has a theme and flavor of its own."
5,The Best of the Best,Every track on this CD is a winner. If you like albums like Celtic Woman you'll love this.
2,not what I expected,It was way to plain. Seemed like I have been listening to one long song. It is nice for the first 5-10 min. Change the tune unless you want to fall asleep. ;)
2,"Okay, but not that great","I don't know, but when I listen to music featuring vocals, it would be nice to hear them come through clearly. I can't say I'm a big fan of Enya's funky harmonic effect (or whatever that multi-toned effect is) that is applied to the vocal track of almost every one of the songs on this CD. Perhaps this is actually a good thing, since when we do actually hear her voice without the aid of electronic effects, it isn't that great, (okay, but not spectacular) and the lyrics aren't that interesting.If I was given an Enya CD as a gift, I probably wouldn't return it, but would I actually pay for another one? Not a chance."
5,"When I'm in the right mood, this album is perfect...","This is not the type of music that dominates my CD collection. However, there are times when I like nothing more than popping in this greatest hits album from Enya and singing along to a bunch of songs whose lyrics mean absolutely nothing to me. Her voice is totally unique, and the songwriting is very unusual. Nonetheless, this album just hits the spot sometimes. If you are new to Enya, this is a great place to start."
4,"A Pretty Good ""Best Of Compilation","Featuring many of the most well known tunes from her four records, this is a good Enya sampler for those unfamiliar with her music. The two songs featured that are not on the other albums are not her best work. This is also a good CD if you like Enya, but don't want to keep four CDs in the car."
4,"Best Enya songs, but not the best Enya CD","They are definitly right when they say that these songs are some of the best that Enya has ever put out. I love this collection of songs. However, this CD is not her best CD. That sounds like a paradox, but I think it is oddly true. The best Enya songs are generally more upbeat than the slower ones, so all of these songs (except a few) are more uptempo (like ""Orinoco Flow""). However, a good Enya album tends to have more variety; uptempo songs mixed with slow instrumental songs. In case you don't know much about Enya, the best way to describe her would be the ""diva of new age music"". All of her music is serene, peaceful, and pleasant to listen to. Buy this album to hear the best induvidual songs that Enya has made, but if you want a better overall album layout, invest in ""Watermark""."
5,Illustrious,"This Enya compilation is an illustrious melange of some of her best songs. My favorite is ""China Roses"" and ""Orinoco Flow"". A new song was added just for this CD called ""Paint the Sky With Stars"" which is a very soothing, pleasant song. The Enya crew who perform and produce these recordings are expert New Age artists. If you own any one CD from Enya, this should be it, for it covers a great range of her sound."
5,The Music of Dreams,"I discovered Enya while living in Europe during the early '90s. At that time Caribbean Blue was getting heavy air and video play on MTV. I could also remeber Orinoco Flow and how much that song had grown on me back in the late '80s. Overall if you are new to Enya this diamond of an album will give you some of her greatest. All of the songs on this album are gems, it's hard not to fall in love with them all (and this is coming from a die hard album/classic rock fan). After this introduction do yourself a favor and pick up Watermark, Shepherd Moons, The Memory of Trees and my personal favorite The Celts. Although I have not listened to the entire album A Day Without Rain sounds like it has promise as well."
5,A Wonderful Collection,"If you are an Enya fan, but aren't sure which one album to buy due to the fact there are so many, I recommend this one.It has a wonderful collection of songs from alot of her different albums. This is a must even if your just getting started with the collection."
2,An Uneven Collection,"By its very nature, this should hardly be a smooth collection, but then again, it didn't have to be this uneven. Van Morrison, Sinead O'Connor and the Chieftains sounds like they hadn't ever done ""Have I Told You Lately"" before this (and if they hadn't, why'd they pick it?), with Van actually singing ""blah blah blah"" at one point, and Sinead (?) dropping her microphone towards the end. Dave Matthews Band's rendition of ""Too Much"" sounds more ragged than it probably had to be, and on the other end of the spectrum, Rod Stewart could have phoned in his lackluster ""Reason to Believe"". There are some good tracks here - Lenny Kravitz's number is spirited, Patti Smith and Lou Reed get good mileage out of moldy numbers, and Aretha Franklin give a great version of ""Think"". Interesting for maybe two listens."
4,Beautiful but not for practice,"This book is really fun to flip through, with great drawings and a wide range of topics. It goes into the ""old fashioned"" tools and techniques that people used to work and clean, and has some information on people who still use them. However, if you are looking for a how-to, this will probably not give you enough information. Not for serious homesteaders, but great for a historical coffee table book."
5,TRACK 13 TRACK13 TRACK 13,"Just listen to the song ""drilling for brains"", there's that breakdown part that simply kicks a$$. It goes-THUMP thump THUMP thump THUMP thump THUMP thump. Death Metal briliance."
3,Dreams - Don't Go to Sleep,"This story did not resonate with me too much. I think the reason is that it seemed that it was a story for kids, rather than adults. However, I commend Mr. Massey for writing such stories. I see a bright future for this young man. He does have a vivid imagination."
2,Blah musical quality...,"I bought this CD at a Christian store today ~ without knowing anything about what it would sound like. I read the reviews here when I got home. Thankfully, (and shockingly,) the packaging can be opened and resealed with no damage to it at all. I took the CD out and listened to a few of the short little songs, and that was all it took for me to carefully repackage it. The sound was flat and BLAH... I knew I could not stand to listen to this with my grandkids, and couldn't imagine that the style of it would draw our precious little ones' hearts in. I'll be returning this to the store from which it came, and will continue my search for Christian kids' CDs for Grandma's house."
5,Love it....,I had this tape growing up and had to buy it for my daughter becuase I loved it so much as a kid. It really is fun to listen to and helps kids learn more about God and the Bible through song. This is how I memorized the books of the Bible when I was little.
5,Wee Sing Bible Songs,"I had this CD as a child in a Cassette tape form and was happy to find it online! It arrived within 3 days of purchase, unharmed and in perfect condition. I absolutly love it and cant wait to use it at our community youth event this weekend. I HIGHLY recommend this for everyone (and specifically music/youth leaders)I would buy again! :D"
5,Must have music book,I've been teaching music for many years and I have piles of music books and CD's.I often come back to my Wee Sing books because of the simplicity and becausethey very often contain the songs that I am looking for. If you were to buyone book to teach to young children about God this would be it. I recommend allof the Wee Sing books to those who want to teach.
5,Very Helpful Book,"As an International Relations major in college, without much of a prior economic background, this book was a life-saver in understanding some of the dynamics of International Economics, theories, events, and the like. After reading this book for just a few hours, I could proudly define everything from hedge funds to globalization, which allowed me greater understanding of events on the news or in scholarly economic or political literature. Why take a an actual economics class, when this book offers just enough insight to make you a much more economically-informed citizen? Even if economics, global or not, isn't your forte?"
4,Great Read,I highly recommend this book. Has an indepth look at world economy from a vantage point. Great read.
3,Interesting but Unfocused,"Steinhardt's extraordinary investment record deserves a book in and of itself. However, I found myself struggling to read this book because I wanted much more detail of his trader life, of which No Bull provides only passing glimpses. This book provides a broad view of his life without a lot of detail about any particular aspect of it. The problem is that the hedge fund world and its firms are rich with colorful personalities and stories, and this book provides only very brief and basic accounts. As a former investment professional, I found the most interesting aspect of this book is Steinhardt's admission that despite his unparalleled success in the hedge fund business, he felt as if he had yet to make a difference in the world - a theme far too common in our business, and a primary reason why I retired from it.I"
1,Kindle version has no maps or photos,"I downloaded the Kindle version thinking I was very clever to have a whole guidebook at my fingertips. I was so disappointed to find it was an ugly, poorly presented version--just words on a page, no maps, no photos, very unappealing. I immediately returned it and ordered the book version."
4,An indepth insight into the genius of DeNiro.,"Although the book tends to contradict itself, it does it's best to give us insight into the very elusive actor. The book is nothing more than a compilation of articles and interviews DeNiro has given during his career. Personal recollections of those who've worked with him are thrown in in an attempt to balance the reporting but it is far from a personal history of the most talented actor working today. However, Andy Dugan does his best to print both sides of the less flattering characterstics and adds personal commentary of his own to allow the reader to make their own judgement of what's true and what's slanted criticism. Because it is hard to find any information about DeNiro it is definately worth reading."
2,Broke within a month,"It was great at first, but it snapped within a month. Kind of large to keep in your pocket, but it does have a belt clip. Opt for another product."
2,Stunning Tome,"What a magnificently high brow review of the subject of pruning.If you can understand what these highly educated folks are talking about then you will not need this book.The wonderfully proper English manner of only indexing by Latin names, colorful use thereof throughout with only minor mention of common names renders this tome utterly useless to the lay gardener.An advanced degree in botany is required to fully grok what they attempt to convey.Shun this item. Wait for a revised version that makes this a useful book vs. the current flogging of hard won degrees."
5,Great way to bond with your partner,I am getting ready to get married in July and this devotional has started us on the right track. It's a great way to strengthen the bonds between you and your partner as well as getting into the word in a positive manner. I think this is a great buy!!
3,Nice Alarm clock but difficult to set,"I've had this for a while now and love that I can set a weekday alarm that will go off Mon - Fri without me having to remember to set it every night. Of course that also means on holidays you have to remember to turn it off and then back on after the holiday. It also has a second ""one-time"" alarm you can set when needed. This alarm wakes me but sometimes my wife sleeps through it. You will need to keep the instructions close at hand if you ever have to reset it though as it is pretty tricky to do so without the instructions. You also need to keep an eye on the battery status as when the battery is low you may not get your wake up alarm or the time will get off - I was using a generic battery and although the battery indicator was not on (to indicate a weak battery) the time kept getting screwed up."
5,Loved it..,This was such a sweet and sensual story. The hero and heroine were great and Emily was perfect. I love Ms. Childs' writing. I was sorry to see it end.
5,The Funniest KIDS book ever!!!,"When I checked this book out of my local library (years ago) the librarians giggled and wished me luck. When I opened it that night and read it to my 2 year old, I knew why they were laughing... and wishing me luck!! This is the best book I've ever read for children and it is great fun (though almost impossible) to read aloud. The pictures are by Tomie DePaola and fit the story so well. My kids would beg for me to read it again and again, because they loved to collapse in laughter while I stumbled over the zany names. Adult friends have enjoyed trying to read this aloud, too! It gives your brain and tongue a real workout!! Highly recommended, along with Tooth-Gnasher Super Flash, and Wempires. Doodleflute too!! Daniel Manus Pinkwater is a wonderful human being!"
5,Love it!,"Easy to put together, sturdy, my son loves to put his special items in the bins. When he has them all over the room he can take the bin with him to make picking up easier. Would purchase again."
1,Did not last one day,My BC chewed it up in a matter of minutes. Didn't last one day! All I can say is that she liked the toy. Not for a dog that likes to chew on toys. It has hard rubber that is easily for her to chew a hole in. If they would make it with the softer latex it would have been a favorite for her.
3,Fun but didn't last long,This Toy was fun to watch but only lasted approximately 3-4 hours before it was destroyed. My dog is not normally a chewer and normally doesn't destroy anything but this toy was gone. It was expensive for the durability you get.
3,Ok but ...,The reception is not ever as expected. Of course the problem of the long whip mast antenna hitting the garage door frame is gone. It looks great but have sometimes trouble to keep a clear sounding radio station. Maybe too short.
3,Annoying beeps,The clock seems good enough but it makes annoying beeps when you do anything - including when you rock it to illuminate it at night or snooze. Who wants to hear a digital beep in the deep dark night when you check the time?
5,good deal,"The chips came as ordered and I had no problems at all. The case is nice, the chips are great. My friend had a set and I tried them and loved them and so had to order my own set. I've been looking for chips like this for awhile and finally found them at the right price. These chips feel great, look great, and have the weight I wanted without the metal insert. Oh yeah, they also make a very nice sound ( not a metallic clink or cheap plastic sound)."
5,Getting the feeling just righ,"Be dumped by your woman through seven years, get drunk, and stay drunk - for about three weeks, wake up and play 'Drive-in Movie'. It gets the feeling just right. Makes me wanna go way up in the mountains, bring my cd-player and just listen, just feel. Eaglesmith's voice is rough as rocks, and fragile as men's hearts. The 'backing' by W.P.Bennett (Juno this year) and R.Schipper is great as always, and D.Pendrith's bassplay and P. Vonalthen's drumming is solid work. Still, and again, it's the feeling of the record that gets to you. The feeling only an Fred Eaglesmith album can bring to life. His ability to write great songs and produce great albums (co-produced by Scott Merritt) is about to be widely known. His lyrics is down to earth, white-thrash kinda beautiful statements on trains and cars and relationships and, well; life. To bad its only 35 min. It's simply a great album. Go buy."
3,"Masque, Other True Self","I prefer Vernon's more imaginative, dynamic offerings from Mistaken Identity and Known/Unknown. Still, for die-hard fans like me there is are a few serious moments on here."
4,ALA worked for my elderly father,"My father was suffering terribly from the effects of aging, and wewere all seeking alternative supplements to help him. Sosin's bookgave some very thorough information on alpha lipoic acid. We doublechecked this information at a good site...We found out that ALA isgood for us younger people too. Thanks to Sosin's book..., myfather is doing much better. He's back with us now."
1,"Not silver, its BLACK",I ordered this hoping to get a sleek silver one as advertised. Instead they sent me a black one....its also made in china and the quality is poor. Now ill look like an idiot giving this as a christmas gift.....great;(
4,Interesting study of a powerful man,"A Clearing in the Distance is a great biography about a man who had great strength and deep sorrows. The first half of the book covers Olmsted's life before becoming a Landscape Architect. He was basically a very talented man who could not find his calling. Once he found it, he pursued his passion with commitment and daring that changed the way that subsequent generations have thought about their environment and surroundings.The book provides valuable insights into both Olmsted the man and the world in which he lives. There are musings that are the author's thoughts and are obviously not historical, but they are interesting too in that they give us insight into the author's biases and interests.Overall, A Clearing in the Distance is well worth reading."
3,Visiting Costa Rica,A good read when visiting the country. I enjoyed/understood the stories much more when I visited Costa Rica and therefore the context in which they were written albeit that many of the stories were written in the earier part of the 20th century. Short stories were a good idea when travelling around
2,TOO SMALL,I RETURNED IT THE DAY AFTER I RECEIVED IT. I HAD BOUGHT IT FOR MY PARENTS FOR XMAS. THEY ARE TOO ELDERLY TO TRY READING IT AT ANY DISTANCE. I COULDN'T EVEN READ IT FROM ACROSS THE KITCHEN. I PURCHASED A LARGER ONE FOR SAME AMOUNT. THEY LOVE IT AND HAVE NO DIFFICULTY READING IT.
1,Made my temperature rise!,"I bought this item thinking it would be the perfect indoor outdoor thermometer, but I was way off! First, it would not recognize the remote temp at all. After trying several batteries and pushing the reset buttons they did find each other. One night outside though and again, it was lost. It seems the two could not be more than 15 or 20 feet apart or they did not share the signals. Even then, it was hit or miss. I was truly dissappointed and sent it back for a refund. Too bad they don't pay for the shipping, so I lost money and got my temperature up! Don't waste your time on such electronic thermometer devices if you live in a snowy cold area like we do. The batteries will not last outside in the cold and you too will be the only thing heating up! I hope this was helpful."
1,disintigrated pump,"put this pump on new central a/c system just over a year ago. Just out of warranty the pump failed. Took the cover off to find the pump housing plastic had crumbled to bits in the bottom of the tank. The pump had been running for a long time and was scorching hot. Called the company and they blamed it on manufacturing chemicals on the A/C unit, and would make no adjustment. Are you kidding? Piece of crap, appears a clear manufacturing deficiency. Many plastics are impervious to chemicals. Buyer beware--be ready to buy one per year! BETTER SOLUTION, COST FREE AND NO FURTHER PROBLEMS, IS TO RUN A GRAVITY DRAIN."
1,Dead on Arrival,"The board was cracked when I received it. The crack was not at a lamination, but in the wood itself. Since the crack itself didn't seem to be a fatal flaw, I decided to go ahead and oil the board and use it. Within days, though the board began to warp and now it is to the point that it is far too unstable to use.The wood used in the construction of the board is, as a previous reviewer commented, far too soft. Even with the limited time I've used the board it looks very chewed up. I bought this board to replace a 12 to 14 year-old Farberware board that had begun to warp but was otherwise in fine shape. Now I have a new board that is worse than the old tried-and-true. It's the trash can for the Chicago Cutlery board; I don't want to deal with the return issue and will check in the local stores for a better board."
2,Comedy... NOT Horror,"This film was an early outing for Bonnie Turner, who would go on to creat 3rd ROCK FROM THE SUN and THAT 70s SHOW. As such, it is a great opportunity to see the roots of this phenominal writer. You can even see her in a bit role as a militant park security guard. However, if you're looking for horror or action, go elsewhere. This is strictly a two note film - the first being a vehicle for Turner's budding talent, and the second to see the phenomenal David Ladner (remember Squiggy in LAVERNE & SHIRLEY?) in an outing as a psychotic clown. Not a great film, but a good bit of amusement for a week night."
1,Broken in 6 months,"6 months later and portions of the numbers display no longer work. The second digit of the numbers no longer functions right. So if it's 1:56pm, it will display :56pm. Or 75.4 looks like 5.4. I tried replacing batteries, but that's not the problem."
4,Recommended,"This book is intended to make writing instruction easier for teachers and parents, and is not bogged down with skills and techniques. Instead it presents the facts and approaches to teaching. The author, Mark H. Newhouse, is a retired teacher with more than thirty years of classroom experience--and his expertise is evident. Following the O/P Plan Newhouse instructs other teachers and parents how to efficiently make writing instruction effortless and straightforward. I would recommend the purchase of Who's Afraid of Essays.This book was reviewed for the Lane County Book Review Program. To read more of our reviews please visit our website at http://www.lane.k12.or.us"
4,Good for the price,"Decent little unit, it does what it says it will. The main unit's thermometer took a few days to settle down and agree with the side-by-side remote sensor, but now it seems to work fine.If you're looking for a good way to tell how hot/cold it is outside, this is a nice unit."
3,A tad bit outdated for me.. I need more information,Great book on how to start up a landscaping business but I need more information directed at lawn maintenance...However I pass it on to a friend who loved it and is making $5000 a month as a landscape subcontractor after 60 days in business... sure beats his old salary of $1800 a month. Now he works outside and great hours and no corporate bull jive!!Easy to read and easy to follow but you will need to seek more books on WHAT TO DO and HOW TO DO THE PROJECTS!!=)
4,Very informative,"The book has plenty of information and ideas for starting a landscaping biz, and presented in a light-hearted style that I appreciate. Thanks to Mr. Dell for sharing his insights."
4,Start Home Base Landscaping Bus,This was just what was needed. Lots to learn. Explanations were clear and direct. Very useful.
3,delightful read aloud,My son enjoys this book. He relates to it because it talks about special things he can do at age four. It covers ages newborn through six. The simple rhyming pattern lends itself to quick memorization by children. The format could also be used by older students as an example of how to write a poem about their own age.
3,A great jazz duet with her longtime friend Regina Belle is missing !,"I like this CD,it's smooth,mellow,enjoyable.It's only too short,it clocks less than 40 minutes...running short of inspiration?What's missing in this nice CD is a 'killer' track and a sweeping duet with Regina...I can't wait to catch them both in concert at the BJCC Concert Hall in Birmingham , AL in the next days !!"
3,The China Moon Cookbook,"This is an interesting book, however my problems with this book lie in the highly complicated procedures. Even assuming the cook in question stays at home all day to cook, the recipes are enough to keep you from using the cookbook more than once or twice a year. That being said the recipes I have used have turned out wonderful, but I consider myself an advanced cook. I also have access to great asian ingredients not available to everyone. The author assumes that you can get ahold of foods not always available to most home chefs and that you have time to spend doing lengthy prep work. As a refference this is a great book, it's simply not practical in most american kitchens."
4,Great Game,This game is a fun squad based FPS. It allows you to control your guy (squad leader) along with one or two other teams of two or three soldiers per team. The controls are easy to learn and moving and ordering your teams to fire is also fairly simple. The graphics are good not great. Overall I recommend this game to anyone looking for a FPS with a twist.
2,"Its okay, graphics are bad","Not sure what happened to this title, the graphics were always good, but theres a lot of problems with the particle effects. The ai are pretty dumb compared to the other series. The sound is good, but game play could of been better. I dont expect great graphics, but these graphics are pretty poor and I use HDMI. I'll place this copy on sale and get the PC version instead. I guess the previous reviewer should of tried it first, his clairvoyance is pretty bad, it didnt even come close."
4,BIA Hells Highway,"Great strategy WWII shooter, difficult but really fun and satisfying, not like any other WWII games because you get to command your differnt squads within your unit which is really cool"
5,No one like SRV!,"This is an outstanding CD with many of the very best by a man who was and remains, IMHO one of the greatest guitar players of any music genre of all time. SRV played with a fire and passion that is virtually unmatch. I keep this in my car and it is my ""go to"" music.If you like SRV, blues of just awesome music do not hesitate!"
4,Works fine,I used this on an extra seat I added to my box van. Easy to instal. Everything was included. For $15 dollars I got my monies worth.
5,Seatbelt,This was actually a joke present that I gave to someone who won't wear a seatbelt when driving or riding. Now he has one with him at all times and may actually be prompted to wear it!
5,Powerful...a must have for Prayer Warriors!,"My prayer life has reached new heights. Very powerful prayers infused with scriptures. Without any great effort I find myself praying the word of God and receiving answers...even when I pray ""freestyle""."
1,PICTURE IS WRONG,"You would think a ""technology company"" like amazon could at least have the correct picture. The picture shows a ""Nifty"" brand mat that is nothing like the cheap husky mat they send you. Three tries and talking to an offshore call center and they still don't get it. THE PICTURE IS WRONG. REPEAT WRONG. WHAT THEY SHIP YOU LOOKS NOTHING LIKE THE PICTURE BECAUSE IT IS A DIFFERNT BRAND AND DESIGN THAN WHAT IS IN THE PICTURE.Unbelievable bad service in straightening this out. Bezos and the bozos who work for him need to be drug tested.I'm selling my stock in this lame company. Try hiring Americans who at least know a car mat from a bowl of curry"
5,best pink hair dye available!,"i have been using this product for 4 years, and i wish the company would hire me as advertising, because i have had many people ask me what i use, and i highly recommend special effects atomic pink. if you bleach your hair, this color lasts so long! i suggest washing your hair with cool to cold water if you want this to last even longer. mixing one part water and one part white vinegar and pouring it over your hair before rinsing out the dye keeps the color in longer by changing the ph level in your hair too. i LOVE this hair color!"
2,Eh,"The color doesn't last very long at all, esp. on unbleached hair. I used to love this dye years ago, but idk.. I think I got an old bottle?"
1,$110.79 list price? You're joking!,"List price is $110.79, so you are getting an incredible deal on this--along with the bridge I have for sale for a mere $10,000. Buy now!"
5,Amazing Book!!!,"This book is great for those who are fascinated with the art of making miniature food. Sue Heaser explains things clearly and tells you what products to use to get that ""professional look"". Good sized pictures make it easier to understand the steps involved in creating miniature food using different types of mediums. Check out Sue's other great books. She's definately tallented when it comes to sculpting with polymer clay and teaching others how to do the same."
2,HORRIBLE STROLLER!,"Man, I wish I read these reviews here before I bought this. It has to be the worst double stroller ever made! It is sturdy, that's true, but so difficult to steer. Even my husband, 6'3"", 200+ pounds has a hard time maneuvering it. It's awful! When I walk in my neighborhood, sometimes it veers to the left or right and I can't get it back on track without stopping and lifting the front end up and sliding it over. Seriously! Don't buy this! I hate it more than anything I've ever bought. I can't wait to replace it."
2,Just ok.,"I use my slow cooker on a regular basis, and while these recipes are easy, they aren't very family-friendly. Also, there aren't very many recipes in the book at all. It seems a bit fancy for my family's taste. It would be perfect if you wanted to entertain using your slow cooker."
3,It's okay,"Most of the recipes are pretty good and at least worth trying. It provided nutrition information and nice substitution suggestions for each recipe, along with a section on meatless meals. I have found that everything seems to overcook for me, though I am not sure if that is a crock pot problem or not, however most of the things I have made taste pretty good. Just be warned, NOTHING will come out looking as good as it does in the pictures, and there are beautiful pictures for each recipe in this book, but experience tells me that meats, especially poultry, just doesn't come out like they show, and neither do vegetables; that is just the nature of slow cooking.All in all, a great beginner's book, good information at the beginning about crock pot cooking, but I am ready to move on."
2,Yuck-ola,If your child is even slightly picky about tastes just forget it. This stuff is rank. It tastes like liquid metal with a hint of orange.
3,Someone needs to review instruction book and supplied symbols.,The instruction booklet indicates a minumum of 2 blanks and possibly up to 4 blanks may be needed.( the house number 1 would require 4 blanks ) Only one blank is supplied with the unit requiring a call to the company to have blanks mailed.
4,Psych and Metal Illness,"Bought this book for my Psychopathology and Mental Illness class. Very informative, but I was not a fan of the structure and lay out. It made it a bit difficult to follow at times."
2,If you like rumors and gossip...,"I have to admit. I thought about giving up on this audio book several times. In the end, I finished it, but it was a less than satisfying read (listen).First, while it is read by the author, a fact I usually love, I honestly didn't care for Mr. Eliot's voice. It grew on me over time, but I wished the book was read by a talented voice actor. Second, is the content of the book, which reads like a gossip rag. I felt like the author would say that studios made up stories and nothing was confirmed and then promptly presented said stories as fact! It was annoying! I also didn't care for the nauseating detail for every movie Grant was in, or thought about being in, or once was rumored to be attached to and so on. I mean sometimes he went on for 15m on a movie Grant didn't even act in!All in all, it was too much gossip not enough substance."
1,Cary Grant; A Biography,"The book was fantasy based in fact. Almost each page was filled with footnotes and dull asides. The book has a point of view. There is no way to know if it is accurate. Some of the book was flat out character assaination. Morals of modern society applied to a more simple time. The writing style was choppy and dull.Cary Grant was a pioneer in the film industry. He was the first star to be an independent agent. The book's perspective was negative, focusing on Grant's alleged homosexuality, not his accomplishments."
4,A Balanced Biography,"I have read biographies that tried to turn sinners into saints and you soon realize you are being had. How can you appreciate the climb if the mountain is flattened? It is not where a life goes that is important, but how it ends. In Grant's case, he was still beloved in his last years - drawing audiences of thousands of people to his one man show - twenty years or more after his last movie. That is an incredible review for any actor."
5,A true delight to read...,"As a great fan of Cary Grant as actor and person, this book is simply a true delight to read. Well written, documented and researched."
2,Waste of Time,"There was nothing in this book that couldn't be found in newspaper columns by Louella Parsons! Eliot found out nothing (or wasn't willing to print) any really personal information about Grant's relationships with any of his wives or co-stars. What Eliot does seem to know a lot about is every movie that was ever made, whether Grant was in it or not. I was looking for something much more personal than a chronology of his movies."
3,A Good Read,"This was a quick read and overall it was a sympathetic and informative portrait of one of the all time greatest stars. There were many stories that I had heard before. But I think Eliot is a good biographer and he is definitely trying to tell Cary Grant's interesting and controversial life story without making it a puff piece or a hatchet job. A poor Englishman from the wrong side of the tracks with a sad family history he became the epitome of elegance and sophistication, an amazing transformation, although the book shows that he was troubled by his past all along. You come away from this book realizing that the part of Cary Grant movie star was the greatest acting job that Cary Grant ever did."
2,Sent two back w/out using either,"Chose to purchase an FLSST25 after reading the positive review on Popular Mechanics, and after having a FL20 serve me well for over 10 years. The new one arrived with a broken handle and a bent shaft. Sent it back for a replacement. The replacement arrived with a bent shaft. Sending that one back for a refund. I guess I'll spend the money on fixing the old one..."
4,Trimmer,This trimmer has been doing a great job for me. It is well built and runs well. This is my third gas trimmer and this had a good write up in consumer reports so I hope it lasts.
1,Bad carburator,"New, out of the box the thing ran horribly. I tolerated it the first season...had to hold the throttle wide open at all times. The second season - it will not run. Had it apart about 3 times, no obvious problems. I broke the air filter cover and choke lever off when I threw the POS across the garage in frustration. Now I can hold my hand over the air filter to keep it running. The problem's obviously a poorly adjusted carb. The problem is the jets require a special tool...so I'm going to have to improvise. The way I see it, I might as well try because it's useless in it's current condition. With a properly tuned carb this thing should be ok. BTW...this weedeater was a gift, if I have to buy a new one I'm going electric."
2,This weed eater dosn't work well for long hours,"This weed eater works okay on small yards only and dosen't do well on big yards. My complain about this weed wacker is that it waste a lot of string when eding and once in a while it stall, hard to start. I know is one of the cheapest out their but dosen't do to well. Finally I decide to buy another brand which is echo and husqvarna weed wacker which works excellent and don't have a problem with echo or husqvarna, plus if you ask most repair shop about this weed eater brand they'll say it trash and recommend to buy echo or husqvarna, sthil, red max and plus if you buy brand new echo power equipment for homeowner you have a five year consumer warranty even if it cost $200 or more."
4,Weed Eater FLSST25 25CC Gas Straight Shaft String Trimmer,"The trimmer shipped in a box not working due to a carb problem from the factory. After 10 days and aggravation it was adjusted.I guess I should have sent it back for a replacement but I didnt.But the final result, The trimmer is light awesome power and a pleasure to use. I am glad I bought it after all!"
3,Weedeater,"I do like the Featherlite weedeater; however, it seems to overheat very easily and is difficult to start. It is more efficient than the last one I had because it covers a larger area."
3,"OK for the price, messy to use","I bought this to replace my previous curved-shaft weed eater which I had for 8+ years. This one has dual line which is a plus. The main problem is the guard seems to be smaller or less effective than the guard on my previous weed eater. Just trimming the grass around the house makes a mess of my clothes. You definitely need goggles or a face shield, just safety glasses will allow grass chunks in your eyes. It is easy to start even at high elevation, has plenty of power and will cut most weeds. But I dread using it because I can't stand being totally covered in grass and weed chunks embedded in my clothes and skin. My old weed eater did not do this."
2,Study Guide review,"When I purchased this, i mistakenly thought it was the hardcoveer book in paperback--it was not. It was merely a study guide to accompany the book. This was not stated in the description! So, make sure you don't buy this unless you already have the full book!!"
1,Display Started Losing Parts of the Numbers.,"Hi,I had bought 3 of these. I used one outside and Two inside. I use the Air Conditioner in the summer, so the Display was not exposed to any high humidity. After 2 Months the display on ALL of them started losing parts of the numbers. Once in a while some may come back, but for most of the time the numbers were unreadable.Do not buy them.Thank you, John."
1,"Junk, just like everyone says.","Yes, this is junk. Thankfully it appears it is no longer a current amazon item, so at least no one will get stuck buying it. My inclination is to stay away from anything else Oregon Scientific sells. My guess is it's all low-cost made-in-China just like much of what Sharper Image used to hawk."
5,Seahawks beer mugs,"These mugs are very well made, and nice to look at. My Daughter and her Husband, Seattle Seahawks fans, were extremely pleased with them at Xmas B.G."
4,StrongArm 4217R Toyota Camry Hood Lift Support (R),I just replaced the failed hood struts on a 1994 Camry V6 Wagon. The hood doesn't fall on my head when I check the oil. Yay!!! You need this right one 4217R and a left one 4217L for the complete job. The left replacement strut is missing the cable bracket of the original. It supports some wiring which you don't want flopping about. I drilled out the spot welds and knocked the bracket off the old one so I could reuse it with the replacement. These came with replacement brass mounting balls but I chose to leave the originals in place since they didn't seem worn.
1,patriots spare tire cover,"Over all good quality, but I wish it was came in a larger size it is a little snug for my tire."
3,Has a couple of moments I really like.,This one didn't live up to the hype for me. I really like their other offerings and this grouping of guys put it down when they were together. Made some rocking music. This one overall was lacking compared to others. Really like Urban Coyote. I'm bummed that there are songs of theirs I really dig that I can't get to.
4,"gee, it's a thermometer...","The description parses a little differently than the actual product: ""Displays indoor or outdoor temperature and humidity"" means indoor and outdoor temperature and indoor humidity. Still, a lot of product for the price."
4,Helpful Guide for Anyone Inexperienced with MSPublisher 2002,"If you haven't worked on Publisher much and need to for your work or school, etc. I would definitely recommend this book. It teaches about many different features in Publisher that I didn't even know existed. However, don't spend the money if you don't use Publisher much. ...You can learn how to design all sorts of print materials... you can even post what you have designed in Publisher on websites... I think that is one of the nicer features. The instructions in the book are very easy to understand and give you step-by-step instruction for working hands-on on your computer."
1,A Magazine Not a Book,"The content of this book is OK, but the poor physical quality of this book makes it feel like a magazine instead of a book. The cover, the binding, the thin paper are actually less substantial than some high quality magazines. This book set a new LOW standard in this respect."
4,Very good!!!!,"Red Circuit plays a terrific proggresive metal, with a traditional metal sound. Great quality solos makes this album unique in their category, so is the musicianship. They makes interesting tempo changes with a great melodies. If you like Evergrey first albums, this is for you."
4,Earth wind ann Fire Beautiful Ballads is a amazing.,"Earth Wind and Fire Beautiful Ballads C.D. is amazing. It brings back all the old tunes that Earth Wind and Fire sang, and become popular for these songs. It put me in the mood of relaxation an tranquilty. Thanks amazon for displaying this wonderful C.D. Sincerely, E.A. Sutton."
2,Where did it go...?,before i had bought this i read some reviews on it and saw that some people had some problems with the plug getting pushed in to the plastic...so after i bought it i was very careful with when putting on controllers...it only took one time of my girlfriend putting it on for it to be pushed in i was suprised at how easy it was i was watching when she did it...the charger works fine and looks great but now i can only charge one at a time till the other gets pushed in.
2,PS3 Controller Charging Station,PS3 Controller Charging Station : its nice but one of 2 sides work with me ..so one work and one broke ..but i use it any way .
1,AS CHEAP AS A PRODUCT CAN BE MADE!!!!,TOTAL GARBAGE. BROKE WITHIN TWO WEEKS!!! BRACKET AND INTERNAL ELECTRONICS ARE WORTH SH@! DONT WASTE YOUR $$$$$$$$$$$$$$ OR TIME !
1,Doesn't work,The product that I was sent Does not work. It lights up but won't charge at all. I didn't feel like going through the trouble of sending it back
4,An Early Thriller from a Cozy Writer,"Early in her career Carolyn Hart wrote a few stand alone mystery/suspense stories. FREE FROM THE PAST is a fine example of what was in store for mystery fans from this award winning author.It was reprinted in a Five Star edition in 1998, but was originally published in the 1970s and previewed many of the thrillers we enjoy today.FREE FROM THE PAST has ""Janey Hamilton"" fighting for her assumed life and that of her beloved husband and daughter as she confronts a past black with the bombing of a plane in which she was an unwitting participant. The plot is fast and tight as Janey struggles to understand who is trying to kill her.An excellent read.Nash Black, author of SINS OF THE FATHERS and HAINTS."
3,Music Lover,"Have you ever had the impression that a poem's content was shaped more by which words rhymed with other words, than by a message the poet was trying to convey? This is my interpretation of T Bone Burnett's ""talent."" The beat of most of the selections is outstanding. But if you listen to the words, you will think, ""Huh?"""
1,Distortion of Facts,After reading this books I was quite dismayed at the many distortions of Mr. Lucke's book.As a person who has experience in the region I continued to wonder where Mr. Lucke found or conducted his research. It was a real dissappointment.
3,Get what you pay for.,You get exactly what you pay for with this set. It is nothing special. Prepare for the smallest chefs knife you have ever seen.
4,sistercook,"I have owned these knives for 12 years. I know they are the bottom of the line in knives but they are the best for me. I have small hands and these knives are just the right size and weight. What good are expensive knives if they are too heavy to wield properly? Yes, you have to put an edge on them and oil the handles and don't put them in the dishwasher. Perhaps I bought the set when this was better quality but for me they are the best!"
1,Once great Cutlery gone down hill,"I am in the food industry and have some great ""old"" Chicago knives. Some of my knives are over 50 years old and still going strong. They have great blades that sharpen easily and wear well.I bought a vacation home recently and one of the first thing I bought for the kitchen was this set of Chicago Cutlery. I was angry when I saw what Chicago Cutlery has done to the quality of their product. Poor grade thin steel blades that feel like toy knives with handles of cheap poor quality wood.Stay away from these knives...do not reward them for destroying a great American Tradition.They should be forced to give up the Name......"
3,Good Start,"I really liked this book at the beginning and love the authors meticulous work on the various henges and energy lines around Scotland. It has got me very interested in the subject of dowsing and divining and how the telluric energies work.Unfortunately the book drops off and meanders into subjects that lost my interest like poltergeists and missing time.I would have preferred more of the first half to continue into another place of interest in the UK, as i'm sure there are many."
2,last of the wilds,I did not like this series. a big disappointment compared to the black magician series. I felt like I was reading a religious novel.
5,At last some real talent,"I just saw them perform on Jay Leno, what a great band! It's been a very long time since I wanted to rush out and buy some new music. The record industry says sales are down well from here in my little corner of the world we buy cds by artist who can really play and sing. Peace"
5,The ULTIMATE WEEZER DVD!!!,"I've just gotten back into listening to the Blue Album and the vastly underrated Pinkerton album and once I saw what this DVD contained I almost passed out. This DVD friggin' rocks!! Not only does it have all the videos, which I've been meaning to get on one tape for ages, but a [...] of extra features! It has a few live shows, Say it Aint So from Letterman, some unreleased songs that are quite decent, alternate videos, shots from tours, and more. Most have commentary by Weezer (with newbie Scott, but sans Cuomo sadly) and Koch which provide funny insights.Only complaint: no live version of ""Tired of Sex"".Weezer are music gods! And their videos are wicked! C'mon, anything with the Muppets in it or animals is guaranteed to rock.Every Weezer fan should shell out the cheap $12 for this ultimate DVD."
5,Such a Great Value,"If the band released both the commentary on the DVD, or the pre 95 era videos on separated DVD's, it would be worth the $15 alone. This is amazing footage that is hilarious as well. Drummer Pat does all sorts of dumb goofy stuff in hotels around the world & what not as well. Bottom line, this DVD is SO MUCH more than just a bunch of the bands music videos smahsed together hastily. There is some really amazing footage here that tells you who weezer is & where they came from. Although rivers doesnt talk much on the commentary if at all, all the backstage footage of him with the band gives you insight into this reclusive & reticent artist, & is worth the price of admission alone as well."
3,Eh,"Like the stars indicate, this is an okay toy. Kind of cheap and my cat doesn't really play with it. He comes when he hears the bell, that's all."
5,Absolutely the best,"Written in a daily devotional style yet with real depth. I couldn't absorb more than Murray gave at a sitting and was repeatedly amazed at the way he opened the word with both great spiritual insight, intellect and deep feeling. I am eager to read another Murray title."
3,Good Overview,This book is a very good overview of the business of writing from home. Just don't expect to see much indepth information here.A good book for those just starting out and looking for information on the generalities of home-based work as well as some marketing ideas for the writing business specifically.If your brand new to this area then I highly recommend this book. If you already have a home-based business or know most of the information needed for starting one up then I suggest other more specific books for your writing business.
4,Nice,Just the product I thought it would be. A professional grade leve. I absolutely love the rubber ends. However I thought the bubble might be a bit easier to see for my older eyes. Great level nonetheless
5,Fits like a glove and looks great,"My Ford truck has a 16 inch steering wheel and most everything out there is for 15.5 inch or smaller. They make these one-size, can't adjust steering wheel covers and that is not help for me. I was lucky to see this cover go up to 16.5 inch. It fits snug, but I know it would go over a steering wheel just a bit bigger. The lace up plastic part is attached at one point. You place this part at lower part of the steering wheel to wrap. Good instuctions with the cover. Took about 10 minutes to install. It feels good, with a very little bit of cushion. If you only need a 15 inch, there are lots of brands and designs out there, but if you have a large steering wheel you do not have many options. This works fine."
2,Great for display .... but not for play,My son loves playing with the Lego Star Wars sets but this one was a disappointment. He enjoyed assembling it and it is a fine looking piece but it does not stand up by itself and the top is easily disconnected. It's really only for display so be forewarned. Also comes with no Star Wars figures unlike many of the others. A rare Lego disappointment.
4,good little set,Good set for a UCS. Good price and building was fun and quick. I didn't like how the legs weren't as articulate as they appear to be. No minifigs either.
4,Love this doll!,"My girls just watched the Little mermaid dvd and they absolutely love this doll. It looks just like Eric and the girls love playing with him and Ariel. We have not tried to change his clothes yet, so I am hoping we dont have a problem like the other reviewer."
2,awful,"I saw this movie when it came out, and swore never to see it again. It is an awful mobvie, and for those who love Gerry, it's even worse. Gerry was in a movie entitled Fast Food, but it was not an American film, and came out in 1998 (not 1989)."
1,Gerry's not in this movie!!!,Amazon lists Gerard Butler as being in this movie. He is in the 1988 British version of it. I never would have bought it if I had known...maybe I should have read the reviews first rather than being so excited over finding the movie!!! I will be more careful ordering movies from here in the future!!!
1,"Bad, bad, bad","Do the research on the organization behind this book. The American Association of University Women is essentially a left-wing front for extremist views about men and women. They are a propaganga led,feminist group mascarading as an acedemic and research organization. The saddest part of this book that is based on anecdotal evidence and ""studies"" largely funded by leftist and tax-payer funded grants into the ""female studies departments"" in universities.The evidence is overwhelming in the ways that schools are failing boys. 70% of honor role graduates were female in 2004. 60% of college bound graduates were female. SO if you want to waste your time reading a politically motivated, pack of misrepresentation of facts and biased studies, then definitely get this book!"
1,Not for the single person,"This book is definitely intended for those who are married and have families -- indeed, one of the four steps is all about dealing with loved ones and the impact the disease has on them. It might be helpful for those who have a family member with fibromyalgia, but it is USELESS if you are single and live alone, as many of the suggested solutions involve having another member of your household help you. Sadly, my cats refuse to cooperate. Far more helpful is ""Fibromyalgia and Chronic Myofascial Pain: A Survival Manual"" (2nd ed.) by Devin Starlanyl and Mary Ellen Copeland."
1,No way man,Okay i'll keep pthis short and sweet who the hell would pay this much for a gun? It doesn't even go that fast i have one now that i got for $40 that goes at least 360fps.
5,The best book for portrait drawing ever!,This book demonstrates a whole new way of drawing human heads. You don't start with the stupid oval that you fill in with features. You start with the features and then work out from the center. Crazy cool! I have taught drawing classes using the ideas and techniques found in this book and the students (adults) amaze themselves! By far the best portrait book I have found.
1,Crumble? I think not.,"No matter what you may write, the Mormon foundation will not ""crumble"". That is a simple truth. Only a man who has not researched the life of Joseph Smith could be so close minded as to think any Mormon would ever be ashamed of him. Joseph suffered persecutions for the truth. And he died for it. And if the Mormon foundation is crumbling then answer me this: Why is the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints the fastest growing church on Earth?"
1,THE CRANES CRUMBLE,"What the Cranes have drudged up is minimal compared to all the evil spoken of Joseph Smith. Things which if they were true would have alienated his followers and doomed 'Mormonism' in its first decade. If Joseph Smith's work is of men, it will come to nought, but if it is of God, then no mortal can hinder it. Either way, the Cranes and their book are inconsequential. Shouldn't the Cranes have some shame first before considering themselves experts on writing about it?"
4,Good songs,I enjoy this CD. It has some very good songs. I recommend it for anyone looking for some meditative/spiritual music.
2,I'm so disappointed,I thought this would be a great companion to the ritual chants by Reclaiming. It wasn't. The Reclaiming cd made me feel like I was in their Circle. Shawna Carol's Goddess Chant makes me feel like I'm in the studio with her - not spiritually inspiring. I'm wondering how I can unload this thing...
3,"Great, but too much philosophy nonsense","Frank Zane's book is great when it comes to workouts and his explanation of bodybuilding principles. But I have two complaints against it:1) There is TOO MUCH philosophical crap. When Zane starts to become a poet, it is unbearable. Look dude, I didn't buy this book so I could get a copy of the ""Power of positive thinking"".2) He plugs his favourite products like crazy. He makes them boldfaced (*every* place they appear) and all caps. I begin to wonder how much money he got for those endorsements. He sometimes sounds like an infomercial.I like this book - the good half anyway."
5,"Cute for kids, must have for adults","The words are the song, but the illustrations are marvelous. Jerry Harston has captured the point of view of the partridge in a funny delightful manner."
2,No Soul!,"This book COULD have been so much more. A subject of such high drama set against the back-drop of the greatest catastrophe in mankind's history should be an engaging read! Fraser fails to engage the reader. This work seems almost watered down and clumsy. It relates nothing of the MAN who was Erwin Rommel. At times the book reads like a high school text and fails to impart the real flavor of the times or the passions of the characters. After reading it (which took effort as each of the 562 pages dragged by) I felt I knew nothing more about Rommel than a basic chronology of life events and that is the tragedy of this book. To experience how military biography should be written, read Carlo D'este."
2,Could Have Been Much Better,"Most striking is the book's lack of maps showing theatres of operation and troop movements. Unless you already have a detailed knowledge of every city and town in which Rommel fought, you will find yourself frustrated at trying to visualize what the author is inartfully explaining. They would have been so easy to add! What also jumped out at me was the author's transparent attempt to put Britain on a pedestal to the exclusion of the U.S. I expected a hint of this in light of the author being British but at points it was over done to the point of being silly. If you came into the book with little or no knowledge of WWII, you'd come away with the belief that the U.S. provided, at best, some assistance to Britain in bringing the Third Reich to its knees."
2,Not as good as it should be...,"I am a big fan of biographies, and read them a lot, especially of historical figures. but I was disappointed with this book. It had very little information on the young Rommel -- what he thought and why -- or the motivations of the older Rommel. Most of the book is more of a narrative history of WWII in Africa and Europe, and not a very good one at that. It has very poor (and very few) maps to follow the action, and, to me, some mind-numbing narrative of hard-to-follow battles. In my opinion, the best biographies are the ones that really give you insight into the thought processes of the subject (e.g., the David Cullough ""Truman"" or the Stephen Ambrose ""Eisenhower""). This book did not do that -- I feel that I don't really have much more of an understanding of Rommel now than before I read it. I guess I'll have to continue my search for the definitive Rommel biography."
3,A Decent Read,"When i bought this book, I knew it was a reprint. I would say that this book is enjoyable but it does not compare with her newer work. The book has the usual Laurens flare, yet it still is lacking in some areas. I would suggest you read this if you are a die hard fan. if you are new to Stephanie Laurens i would suggest you read her Cynsters novels first."
2,Another arms-race supplement for the Realms,"Though the concept of the Magister as a Highlander-for-magi ""there can be only one"" concept promises high adventure and danger, this book doesn't seem to live up to that. One might term the Magister an avatar of Mystra, although that would not quite be correct... it's more a position akin to a research professorship bequeathed by the ultimate Dean of Studies. Too much filler material, drawn with a broad brush and overly stereotyped - this book seems like it should have been a couple chapters in a larger text rather than padded out to fill its own volume."
1,Not sure what its meant for..,"I have a 22LR revolver, and i bought this on here hoping it would clean my barrel. but when i pushed it into the barrel and pulled it out, all the little brass metal pieces came out with it"
3,"Good for frog, but larger than expected","I ordered this bridge for our 2.5 gallon hexagon tank that houses one African dwarf frog. Our frog really likes being able to hide under the bridge and, unlike a lot of aquarium decorative items, it does not have any sharp or rough edges that could damage his skin. My only complaint is that it is much larger than I expected. It takes up the full width of our small tank."
4,almost perfect,"I was happy with ring. Workmanship was good, i liked the appearance. My only complaint was that they don't have half sizes.Mine was a little tight."
4,Pretty Good Pie,"I live in Nashville and have heard the ""buzz"" about these guys. I was pleasantly surprised to take a listen and like what I heard. Seems to me they can live up to the talking. Record is solid. Songs are good."
3,Uneven and disappointing,I heard the lead cut on CMT and couldn't wait for the CD to come out. What a disappointment. This is a mish-mash of styles with one good song and a couple other okay songs. I especially disliked the Beach Boys homage. Sorry. I really wanted this to be great.
5,HOT HOT HOT,"I Love The CD, Love The Band.Truly great music you can listen to them on repeat and never get tired of it!"
2,Can hear O'Dette breathing...,"This may or not be an issue, and I agree that this is a subjective kind of thing... For me, personally, hearing an instrumentalist's mouth and his breathing is NOT good quality recording... maybe some like it for authenticity? The music is lovely, but unfortunately I find the extra bits extremely distracting."
1,What a company!,"Fine if it works. Mine still reads 10 degrees off on indoor temperature. Just received it back after Oregon Scientific had it for over TWO months for repair! The only difference is that now it's all scratched up. Oregon Scientific is an impersonal, contemptuous company that you don't want to ever have to deal with. They are as bad an outfit to try to get help from that you can imagine. Guess what - they have a great vision and mission statement... They should work on customer service instead of heady mission statements. All in All, I would recommend ANYone else; you don't want to have to deal with this bunch!"
4,Dirtections Stink!!!,"This is a nice unit unfortunately paired up with terrible directions. As stated in other reviews, Much was not explained correctly. Much grief could have been saved with better directions. My unit was shipped to me with a adapter plug used overseas. I tried many times with Oregon Scientific and some distributers to get the correct one and was totally ignored. I ended up making one with the right voltage and amps from an old cordless phone. The unit itself is great, providing what anyone wants to know of weather."
1,fictionalized version of the author's fictionalized experiences,"Book Description'Vietnam: One Unaccounted For' is a version of the author's actual experiences as a U.S. Army, Special Forces/Special Operations soldier during one of his six years in Vietnam.the author was never a Special Forces/Special Operations soldier and did not spend six years in Vietnam. this can be verified through various sources."
3,"Cute, but creepy","I got this set for my 3 yr. old daughter because she loves Spongbob and just started playing with Barbie dolls. I thought the dolls were really cute upon getting them. I was disappointed that they don't seem meant to come out of their costumes. Although with much struggling, I was able to get the one out of the Spongebob costume. My daughter likes playing with them, but often tells me ""Look Spongebob and Patrick are eating little girls!"". While that's funny, it is kind of creepy too and I can see how she thinks that. Overall a cute toy, but wish the dolls came out of the costumes."
1,Another No Limit joke,"Master P is the least talented rapper since Positive K. His completely thoughtless lyrics and annoying grunts make me want to punch all the no limit soldiers. The only thing about the album that doesn't piss me off is the track ""Souljas"", which is so stupid, I just can't stop laughing at it. If you purchase this album, you will lose any faith you ever had in the No Limit peops."
4,Great P album,"I was kinda disappointed with things after Ghetto D. I only liked 5 tracks off The Last Don double CD. However, I'd recommend this album for those fans like me who were worried if he'd put out a great album in the hype of all the Cash Money Millionaires success."
4,Overall A Good Cd,"THIS CD IS TIGHT BUT I THINK IT COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER. BOUT DAT #2 ON THIS CD IS ONE OF THE TIGHTEST SONGS OUT RIGHT NOW. OTHER GOOD SONGS ON THIS CD ARE: DOO RAGS, GOLDS IN THEY MOUTH, POPPIN THEM COLLARS AND SOULJAS. I LIKE THIS CD BUT SOME OF THE TRACKS ARENT GOOD AT ALL. IF YOU ARE A RAP FAN ID LISTEN TO IT BEFORE I GOT IT BUT IF YOURE A MASTER P FAN DEFINETELY GO GET IT. BUT MASTER P IS ONE OF THE BEST RAPPERS NOW."
1,very poor sound quality,the sound that this mic picks up is terrible! The mic built into the SD camcorder that I had was better than this thing. I tried it with and without the wind cover but it was poor either way. the mic in the camera could pick up sound louder and further away. I tested it about 15-20 feet away and I could barely hear me on it. Do not buy this! If you want real sound then save up the money for the $100 plus mics. its well worth the money instead of this which will only make your audio worse.
2,ATR25 disappointed,I have to be honest I went for the price and was disappointed. I was looking for a stereo microphone that would improve the sound recorded by my camcorder. I made some test recordings using the ART attached to 2 different hot-shoe type mounting brackets. The first extended the microphone off to the left side and the other lifted it above the camera. I downloaded the footage on to my computer and opened it with Vegas Movie Studio Platinum. All three test attempts contained camcorder motor noise at about the same intensity in all attempts. The microphone has lots of features and accessories but did not work for me. I returned it to Amazon and opted to purchase the more expensive SMX -10 Azden and it worked just fine with no motor sound and it eliminated the background sound that the on-board microphone picked up.
4,Very Nice Mic,It is very nice mice .. comparing to the price it is great ..It picks up the sound in stereo mode very nice. If you moved front of the mice from left to right while speaking you will notice the different sound coming from the left and the right ears.It it is light unit but using very nice and material.. does not look cheap at all.Nicely packaged.I wish if it has Tele and Close mode instead for just one mode.I wish it came with to clips one for the camera and another one for using the mic over stand. with the items comes with it you need to unscrew the camera clip and re-screw the stand clip.It came on time I'll order more from the same company.It comes with life time warrantyP.S. I guess some sites on the internet says this model is discontinued. But I believe this will not the warranty or the technical supportEnjoy :)
4,"If this is classical, I'm hooked.","I ordered this CD simply after having listened to the selection entitled ""Anahid"" on public radio. Don't be dismayed when you listen to the title piece; ""And God Created Great Whales"" is totally out of context with the rest of the CD. The remaining hour of music is a breathtaking performance of strings and flute that ranges from pastoral to incredibly uplifting. Admittedly a classical neophyte, I don't have the vocabulary to review this work properly - you just have to buy this CD and hear for yourself. Absolutely wonderful!"
3,Good delivery,it didn't take very long for me to receive my screwdrivers that was one of the plus's the second plus is that they sent me an extra screwdriver that is a voltage detector. the down side is that in the picture that they showed on the internet was a six screwdriver set all red screwdrivers that said Pratt-Read which i never heard of but i looked into them and they are made in the usa the screwdrivers i received do not say a brand name or where they are made but over all they will do oh ya they came with a carrying pouch probably won't use it but still pretty cool
3,Pure Nude doesn't mean that you will see much,"I can't speak to the yoga value. I purchased this DVD as a screen saver for the TV. As a screen saver it serves it's purpose, However if you are considering it for the ""Pure Nude"" part you will be disappointed. Some T, a little A, NOTHING else."
3,Nice Guy Eddie,"This series which employs erratic, Guy Ritchie-style camera work that was probably dated before the pilot finished airing works mainly thanks to the charms of its stars. Mark Valley as the lug out of water is very likable and Sienna Miller was plainly destined for bigger things. The stories are never terribly compelling and the humor can get pretty crass, but still worth watching."
3,"Needs the Real Music, but better than nothing.","I would gladly pay the extra cash for a version of this Box Set with the music that was originally part of this AMAZING series (How I wish it was not cancelled). That being said, Keen Eddie without the great music is better than no Keen Eddie Box Set at all. Thats why I still give it 3 stars because you still get the great writing, acting, and editing which makes up most of the show. If you have not seen the show, buy this set and you will not be disappointed. If anyone knows if there is a chance that a version with the music will be released please let me know."
3,Unsophisticated,"~My three-year-old son loves Bob the builder. That is the reason I bought this game. However, this product is just blow the bar. Poor graphic quality and boring game design. Compared with the kid software made by Disney or other company, this product is not refined enough and gives people home-made feeling. I gave it 3-star instead of 1-star because it is still a Bob the builder and my son likes to play with it. If you want to buy a Bob the builder PC game, this is one of the only two on the market.~~ If you just want to get some really nice pc game for young kid, look for something else.~"
3,"Good information, not so good meal plans","There is a wealth of really useful information about food in this book. Unfortunately, I find the meal plans in this book too unrealisitc for my lifestyle. I cherish the book for the rest of its contents, though!"
5,Suspenseful! A great read!,"This is the fourth installment of this series and the first full length novel. I have thoroughly enjoyed the entire series but the novel is especially good. The characters are well drawn and the plot is loaded with suspense and twists. You need not read the series first, the novel can stand alone, however I heartily recommend the entire series. I am starting #5 right now."
3,"Good bag, but very large !","I bought this bag to replace my original Combi diaper bag. The bag has all the features described and is very functional, but it is extremely large. It was very big and bulky empty and I cannot imagine packing it up to go out. i loved the print and all the compartments, but if you want something practical this bag is not it."
1,Great for Toddlers,"The Telestory system is an inexpensive way to entertain and teach your child about reading. Each cartridge has two stories on it. Your child can choose either to have it read to him or read himself. The video quality isn't crystal clear, but he doesn't seem to notice. The bad thing is that most of the stores that had the cartridges put them on clearance. I don't even know if the company makes these anymore. I over all rated at one star because of this. It is very difficult to find a variety of cartridges. Since these were clearanced out of virtually every large toy store, I don't forsee them making more. So a good, cheap toy for your toddler/preschooler if you know that going in you may not be able to get more cartridges easily."
5,Very interesting read,This was recommended by our tour. It provides an interesting historical (fictional mostly) look into Prague. There are many short stories by Czech authors which help prepare one for a visit.
1,Need replacement already,"The cassette player door does not work and it ""ate"" a tape.There are only adults here, so it was not mistreated. The supplier has been notified, and I am hoping to return the item for a replacement of the same model."
1,It's not at alll good...not worth the price..don't buy it....,It looks good on the website when you see it...but it's not that good in appearance in real...Sound quality is fine.....but the whole system looks like a piece of crap...
1,DO NOT BUY,I rate this item with a 0. It is not worth the money. It looked very similar to the one we have had for quite a few years. It is very cheap----the entire unit is cheap quality. I like the design but thats it. I should have sent it back.
3,large overrated boombox,This boombox is just ok. Sound is not that great. I definately prefer my Sony which has a much better sound
2,"CD and Tape player works well, but not radio","The analog dialing is very sensitive and difficult to adjust in finding a station.Also, it does not do well in bringing in a station.It would be good if it had a digital tuner, and had more ability in bringing in a station."
1,"Typical American ""warm n Fuzzy""!!","Covey has yet to realise that his paradigms and visions are merely the application of veneers,with the true person beneath exposed once reality bites! It's like reading the script from Dale Carnegie's life story,strung out into seven dilapidated and antiquetous beliefs. Do yourself a favour,pocket your hard earned cash and get stuck into life..instead of analysing it!!"
4,"Don't Expect ""new"" habits, understand and gain insight","Much of the criticism of this book seems to focus on the idea that there isn't anything ""new"" here. So be it. If the 7 Habits are all-encompassing and universal, then to expect 1, or 2 or 3 new ones is pretty silly. Repetition is the mother of learning, and having additional examples or frames of reference helps to add insight and examples of putting the 7 Habits to work. This, and other ""7 Habits"" material are merely supplements to the original concepts and ideas and, to me, are merely vehicles to aid in the development and understanding of their usage in everyday situations. Regarded in that context, there's probably room for more of this type of information in much the same way that there are now so many ""Chicken Soup"" volumes available. I'm surprised that so many reviewers don't seem to ""get it""."
2,Snake Oil,"Covey says all the right things about what we should do and how we should behave - I agree. But what he doesn't do is provide adequate motivation for changes in our behavior - the only motivation is getting others to do what we want: manipulation. True motivation comes from something larger than us - faith in a God who is bigger than our own petty self-serving lives. Covey sells good snake oil, but your money would be better spent on a copy of the Bible."
5,7 Habits in action!,"I hesitated to buy this book. After reading 7 Habits of Highly Effective People, I thought that Dr. Covey had said all that he needed or could say. Boy was I wrong?In living the 7 habits, Dr. Covey brings the 7 Habits to life. This book touched my heart and my soul. It made me dust of my old copy of 7 Habits and read it again along with this volume. It made the 7 Habits work like never before and created more balance and happiness inmy life.If you are not touched agter reading this book, then you had better check your vitamin dosage. It is powerful."
2,Too Hard Selling,"I read '7 Habits of Highly Effectively People' twice. It was great ! But I find 'Living the 7 Habits:Stories of Courage and Inspiration' is centred on '7 Habits' as a commercial product, not on humans or their emotions. There are touching parts. But there are much more hard selling on the '7 Habits' ... the contents focus more on the '7 Habits' but not on helping or sharing with the readers. Even the book's design shows you the book is for selling '7 Habits' and Franklin Covey's products."
3,Not mentioned in description,"Note, that I have not used the product yet. These are just -out-of-the-box impressions. The description states that it is ""Compatible with Oregon Scientific's wireless weather station"". However, be warned that you MUST own that unit.The WGR968 is ONLY a transmitter and completely worthless unless you have the weather station.Also, (sarcasm warning) could they have printed the manual using a SMALLER type style? It is printed in english, french, spanish,german, but only for people with VERY good eye sight."
2,YOU CAN FIND BETTER,This book is clear and colorful but doesn't have any thing unique about it . I gut it cus i thought they will show me how to make the necklace at the fist page but its not there :s. trust me look for anther book with more knots and better ways to use it. Heba from Ksa/Uk
5,"Complex, Beautiful Knots Demystified","This book is a beginner's dream introduction to knotting. Complete with clear, concise step-by-step directions and large color photos of each step, this text is sure to be an enjoyable resource to anyone looking to learn how to achieve beautiful knot work designs on the first try. I personally am applying many of the designs to some hemp work, so the contents are easily modifiable to your own creative ideas. There are ""patterns"" you can follow but these are secondary and the book focuses on showing you the main techniques so you can apply them however you like in your own works."
1,Only 100 pages,"That is as far as I got. I could not go any further. I kept asking myself what am I reading and why do a care. The characters hold little interest, and the style of writing nearly incoherent. Don't believe the Publisher Weekly's review, this book is nothing like the novels of George R R Martin."
2,Purple Prose,If verbosity and laconic description of suffering gets you to the hall of fame in the field of fantasy steven ericson has arrived there now. With purple prose and a nearly unbearable style this very elongated tale is filled with cliche! To mention a few: the evil empress the ambitious high wizard the zynic young warrior the good and homey whitch the flying city (thanks to ken bulmer and r. vardeman) unspeakable elder races verbose thiefes empty and vain eldermen (thanks to relaity)and all this is mixed into a jumble and drawn out into a long indigestible dough.
4,Magic under the Moon,"This is an extremely complicated and ambitious novel...dear lovers of fantasy,... on the scale of the Lord of the Rings and Dune, although, as far as these elves are concerned, not as engaging. None the less, while it evoked our imagination less than the fore mentioned books, it was interesting and we did not abandon it part way, nor really feel the urge to do so. It is primarily the story of an Empire striving to conquer its neighbors told through the lives of soldiers, mages, thieves and assassins on both, or really all three sides. It also, much like Greek myth, included the machinations of the gods. It is a confusing book and much goes unexplained, which seems impossible considering how long it is and yet, we liked it. What more could we say?kyela,the silver elves"
3,Ponderous,"I know these books have garnered tons of critical acclaim and I can understand some of it. The author is a wonderful wordsmith and he has created a vast world with a history and various races, the problem for me was that there wasn't a single character that I remembered when i was finished. That stood out in my mind as being the ""protagonist' I enjoyed the style of writing immensely, but I am a fast reader and never has it taken me so long to finish a book. Too much detail perhaps?"
2,I Have No Idea What's Going On,"I read about 1/3 into this book. A lot of stuff happened, and a lot of characters got introduced. And I kind of know what happened so far in this book with them.But I have no idea what happened so far. There was a battle. There was magic. There was demonic possession. And all of these things just happened randomly, with no explanation, to characters that sometimes I had just met and knew nothing about. There were some Serious Conversations about how horrible X Character's behavior was, but still...Maybe it gets better. But I'm done reading it, and I like having some idea of what's going on."
1,"After 100 pages, still waiting for something to hook me! I give up","OK, I just finished reading ""The Way of Kings"". I was hungering for more reading material b/c that book was so darn good. So in that respect, maybe the next book I would have read no matter which it was would not make me feel very satiated. BUT... this book is so confusing and the names are so ridiculous and there are so many characters that you learn very little about that you just cannot make sense of the thing.Don't waste your money.. Try the first book at a library and then when you see what I am talking about go get ""They Way of Kings"" by Brandon Sanderson, or the three Eragon books by Christopher Paolini if you want good reading that gets you interested in the first dew pages of the FIRST book...Maybe what Steven Erikson really needs is a pony tale and a few cats..."
2,Not for me,"I can't get into this one. I've started it 3 times, and I never get more than halfway through before I get bored with it. I wish I could love the series as much as everyone else seems to, but it just falls flat for me. I know persistence can sometimes pay off (I took me 3 tries for both Lord of the Rings and Wheel of Time), but I don't think this one is going to make it for me."
3,Overly complex but passable,"Too many characters with too many changes of narrative with too many societies/cultures/races and subplots. I like ensemble story telling and plot twists and am a huge fan of GRRM, but this goes over the top. Frankly, it collapses under it's own weight for a while until the author thins things out towards the end. I liked the intermixing of gods and mortals - very Greek. But with all of the changes in narrative and all of the races/cultures/societies, etc to keep track of, it was difficult to really develop a love for the characters. The authors style reminded me a little of Gene Wolfe - sometimes the characters disappear or have strange experiences that ultimately distract or detract from the story telling.If you like Gene Wolfe or the Gormenghast novels, you will probably love this book - I could only manage to like it."
2,Too much to keep track of,"This book has more plot threads than a Tom Clancy novel. Every one of them is difficult to understand. It's hard to relate to the characters because every time you think you are getting to know the setting and characters, the book switches to something completely different.I knew when I started that there were going to be a lot of characters, and based on all the positive reviews here, I really tried to keep going. When I had almost gotten used to what was going on, yet another change of scene and a whole new set of characters was thrown at me. Talk about alienating your readers! I finally had to give up."
2,250 pages to get mediocre,"With most fantasy books there is a ""learning curve"" where the reader has to find out about the world so they can follow the plot and characters. In this book, that takes 250 pages. If I hadn't been on vacation with nothing else to read, I never would have made it that far. It gets interesting after page 250, but it's still confusing and I never cared about the characters. Erikson has created an extensive plot with tons of characters but in this book he lacks the skill to weave them all together into a coherent and engaging narrative. Hopefully he pulls it off in the next book in this series. I hate to see all that potential go to waste."
4,Looking forward to more.,"All in all, in the end, I really enjoyed this book. It was a little slow to start, and somewhat confusing. It almost felt like the first quarter of the book what a mystery novel, and the mystery was trying to figure out and follow the story line. I found this very frustrating and nearly stopped reading, but I pressed on and was happy that I did so. I'm not going to go into the different aspects of the story, if you want to know that then read the book. My reviews are based on personal experiences of whether I enjoyed to book or not, I hate spoilers so I do my best to avoid them. So, although the book started slow and was confusing, Steven Erikson was able to bring it together in the end. The last quarter of the book I couldn't set down and stayed up late to finish. My biggest disappointment is that book 2 is not available on Kindle."
4,Long and convoluted can be a good thing,"It can be a bad thing too.I'd read this series with bookmarks. (I am reading it via kindle, which is nice for the bookmarking). I have found that I like to take note of when a character is first introduced because there are SO MANY of them that I lose track of their names.Now on the second book which introduces even more characters, I am a little annoyed.That said with a little patience (and maybe a few notes) this story is very engrossing, extremely well crafted and very (VERY) detailed.I do feel at times that there is not enough time spent on individuals and that the complex plots might be better served by fewer perspectives but that isn't going to stop me from reading the entire series.Which, I might add, I would like to buy as a set on kindle because the individual books are really expensive."
3,too cerebral,Too many interconnected plots to fit my tastes. I never really got invested in any one character before he jumped to another.
3,Hard to get started.,Really intricate book with a ton of side story lines that don't get elaborated on very well. Main story is fantastic and character development is excellent.
3,Totally utterly confused..,"Some people in the reviews seem to be able to get this book effortlessly but i keep asking myself ""Huh?"" throughout the entire book. Yeah I undertstand the main plot but none of the characters interest me enoguh to make me remeber who or what they are. I kept wondering if this was the first book in the series because erikson, imo, doesnt explain his world good enough in a debut novel to the reader. I kept wondeirng if i was missing information trhoughout the book... i dont know if ill read the next book or try to look for another book"
2,A valiant attempt,"This is a relatively simple tale, even if there are quite a few characters and storylines of different backgrounds ie. humans, mages etc.. However it pales into insignificance beside authors like George R.R. Martin. The author has a soaring imagination, and is to be congratulated on persisting over 8 years in order to get this novel published, but soon after commencing to read the book it becomes rather obvious why he suffered so long it getting the work published. The writing is somewhat juvenile in nature, the dialogue especially weak and often obtuse and meaningless in the context of the story. However, I assume this first novel was written when the author was quite young, so I grant that the more recent books in the series (with book 8 being now released) are of a much more mature and experienced nature, and are therefore most likely to be very enjoyable for those who have stayed the course, which will not be me, unfortunately. Great imagination, good ideas, shallow execution."
3,The Magic of Lionel,"Video quality could be better. Need to see more accessories working rather than talking and trains going around. Still, well worth the childhood memories.There are some great layouts filmed in this DVD."
2,Not happy,"I just received the second one as a replacement and have the same problem. For some reason their is white paint transfer onto black portions of the tire cover (I can't clean it off with a wet rag). I don't know if it's due to how it's stored or if they fold it up before the printing is set/dry, but this occurred with the first (which I returned) and the replacement I received. It seems as though they lack quality control to check the item before it's shipped.I don't normally write reviews, but I felt this warranted one as a warning. It is obvious from a 5 feet away the white paint on black. If it was only noticeable from a foot away I'd deal with it.If this was corrected I would order another one. I like the look and otherwise think it's a great looking tire cover."
2,Present tense,"I did not like the present tense approach the author used, disconcerting. This is OK when giving lecture, marginally, but not for the written word unless it is actual dialog."
3,Hard to program,"I like the product okay, but it is kind of confusing to program the settings. It uses centimeters for the height and kilos for the weight, which I don't like. I am still working out how to save the settings for each person."
1,Shellcore makes garbage,I bought several Shellcore items as Christmas presents for a young nephew as well as for our own young daughter. The products were garbage. They look and behave in a way that screams cheap piece of junk. Do not buy any Shellcore toys for your babies! They aren't worth the money. The Buzzin' Beehive just sits and makes a weird crackling noise that I'm assuming is the alleged buzzing noise and that's it. That's all the toy does. My daughter was immediately bored with it.
3,"Looks & feels great, but falls apart!","I've had two of these sets - the look is amazing and it's soooo comfy to sleep under. But my first set fell apart at the seams in the washing machine, and got all kinds of link stuck too it that will not come off. I was so upset that I tried the second set (yes -- I went out and bought another) at the laundromat on delicate cold. It fell apart again. This material is that really thin cotton that feels good, but won't stand up to even the delicate cycle. I am so dissapointed, but what can you do?"
2,lacking detail,"Some interesting accounts but all too often frustratingly lacking in specific details. Far too anecdotal and vague to be taken seriously as a convincing read. Really just a collection of stories rather than an attempt to present a well researched investigation into the phenomena of ghosts backed by solid facts, empirical data, and/or seemingly compelling evidence. Ultimately disappointing from someone who is touted on the cover as ""the world's leading paranormal investigator""."
4,Grandson Loved It,Christmas gift to my grandson was really a hit. He loves playing with his Star Wars toys. Even the older grandsons envied it.
2,T.C.O - High - Print quality very average -- not a good buy,"I bought this printer for its low Total Cost of Ownership as the ink tanks are relatively cheap, however after about 9 months I started to get reduced print quality ""banding"" which are white lines or missed sections of ink from the nozzels on the Blue part of my prints which is due to blockage of the fine nozzles of the print head. No amount of cleaning could fix this which results in the requirement of a new print head. Investigations show that the cost of a replacement head is almost the same cost as the printer !!Until Canon reduce the price of replacement print heads to a sensible level i.e < 20 DO NOT buy one of these printers as you will not be impressed by the maintenance costs incurred."
3,Satisfied... but,"It helps in isolating sounds so that you ""mostly"" pick up whats in front of you. However, the rubber grommet or connection that is at the base of the unit and secures the cable is extremely noisy. If you are not careful, you tend to pick up a constant squeaking sound from the movement of the cable. All in all, I'm satisfied with the product but not impressed."
4,Great Mic Especially For The Price,"Great sounding mic. Just make sure you get an audio recorder with it. I use the Zoom H1 with it and the quality is awesome. If you're shooting on a DSLR directly into the camera, I recommend defeating the AGC(auto-gain control) otherwise you'll have a lot of mic hiss. You can remove hiss in post production but getting as much clean raw audio as you can is key."
1,Total waste of money,"Either this product is just plain bad of I just wasn't lucky and received a bad copy.The thing is that this mic was so insensitive that in order to record a clean sounding voice I had to put it about 1"" away from my mouth. Otherwise you wouldn't hear a thing. Tele setting was better but still, it would record only sounds within a few feet. Also a lot of noise was present.Built quality is good though, nice, sturdy metal casing that seems to be rugged.I contacted customer service, but never got any answer.Too bad that a company like Audio Technica allows for such a bad quality."
2,"Nice, but not built to last.","I've owned this pair of slippers for approx. two months now. They're very comfortable, easy to slip in and out of and keep my feet very warm. However, they haven't held up very well. I've only worn them around the house, indoors--nothing extreme or out of the ordinary. The padding on the inside bottom lining became flat and as hard as the sole of the shoe after about a month. Now another month later, the inside lining is starting to strip and come off the shoe. They were nice at first, but had I known this would happen I wouldn't have spent them money on them."
3,UPDATE - Quality and Affordability,"UPDATE: It's now eight months later and I'm no longer quite so happy with these slippers - the lining in the toe area (bed of slipper) has come loose on both of the slippers. Not what you would expect for slippers at this price.Another great buy from Amazon! These slippers are true to size, comfortable and well made. I've had them a few months now and I can say they are the best pair of slippers I've owned, and at 62, I've owned lots of slippers. The soles are non-slip, they are well padded and warm and can be worn outside as well as inside - great slippers that are affordale, not much else need be said."
1,Not even one season's use,"When I first got these I liked them - they appear nicely made and are comfortable to wear. However, less than 5 weeks into wearing them the lining is tearing away inside and my toes get scrunched up around the lining and I can't even stand to put my feet in them. Waste of money - I'll never buy another pair of anything from LB Evans."
4,"Nice knife, but handle seems cheap","OK, I'm a cutlery snob...so rating this only 4 stars is actually a compliment. Not a bad knife, but the handle seems a bit cheap for something this expen$ive."
2,not what web sight discribed,"pages ripped, had to use clear tape to keep them from getting worse....front cover is covered with ink pen scribbling, and nothing can be done to repair it..."
3,Not that great,"I did not enjoy this album after I bought it. I am a big fan of Alias and have most of his albums, including both of the albums with Tarsier. But this album failed to live up to expectations."
2,Moisturizing but messy,"I wanted to purchase a lip glass without harmful chemicals, so I bought this one. Kudos to Gabriel Color for making less toxic make-up products. I wish there were more of those! However, I hope they can find a better formulation for this lip gloss. After using it for the first time I knew I would not buy this product again. The product is very sticky and ends up on my teeth unless I am very careful to only apply it around the edges of my lips! Also, it is very thick and oozes out the top every time I use it, thus my make-up bag has become a mess as a result of this product."
3,Traditional Carols arranged for Bells,"One of the first CDs released by the famous Westminster Concert Bell Choir, this is a pleasing collection of well-known Christmas carols arranged for handbells. Westminster is home to one of the earliest and best-known university handbell ensembles in the country, started by Don Allured in the early '70s. This recording suffers from poor sound quality (the high bells have a crashing sound) and relatively stale readings. It is buoyed, however, by excellent arrangements by Betty Garee and Mr. Allured. Also, at this time Westminster played on the widest range of handbells in the world: over 7 octaves of bronze handbells. This CD is an essential for the collector and student of handbell ringing, as Mr. Allured and the Westminster Concert Bell Choir have had a dramatic impact on the modern art of handbell ringing all over the world."
3,"Pretty good, but...","Not the size advertised. While it's supposed to be 21 x 31, it's actually more like 18 x 28. I don't know, maybe if it was flat?Anyway, I have a 20 x 32 floor in the kennel I have, and it's pretty short all the way around, especially the length.Well made and cozy though."
4,Good standard dog bed,"This is a pretty good doggy bed, and especially for the price. My dog especially loves the ""bumpers"" on the surround, which she uses as a pillow. I actually own the Precision Crate that is one size up from this bed size, but I wanted to allow for some extra room in the crate for her food/water bowls (feeding her in the crate was one way I used to get her more comfortable with being in the crate). This bed is the perfect size exactly for that - there is just enough room for both the bed and the food/water bowls. Now that I don't use the crate very much anymore, I took the bed out, and she still likes sleeping on it, often preferring it to the bed or couch.I did expect that the base of the bed would have had more padding, though; it is much thinner than I would have thought. But it did make it easy to roll up and pack when I take her on trips, though... and easily machine washable, as well."
5,Dog's Favorite Bed,"New puppy really likes this bed, so easy to take care of. Puppy had one accident due to my not paying attention, but throw it in the wash and good as new."
1,classic bait and switch,"I must admit that this is the first time I've been really disappointed with an Amazon product.I would have ignored it, except that even in the boiler-plate request for me to ""rate this product"", it appears as a set of three gloves, as it did in the initial hustle.Be warned that you will not get three gloves, but only one.My stupidity, but when I see more than one of a product being sold I---silly old me---assume that's what being sold.I'll still use Amazon. Stanley, on the other hand....."
1,disappointed,The manufacturer sent me 2 of these as replacements for a previously recalled item. Neither one worked.Save your money.
2,eh..,"It was good for the first two months. It would pick up the signal from 15 feet away easily. Then In December, it stopped working. I had to be 2 feet away from it for the signal to pick up. I replaced the battery with brand new duracell fresh out of the package and same problem. I would say look for something else. If it was 5$ then I'd say OK, it worked for 2 months but what should I expect?"
2,Only one out of two works...flustrating!!,"I have always had good luck with things I order from Amazon, but this time has not been good. I ordered two super wireless remote switches and only one works. The other is a total dud. I have tried everthing...change battery 3 times, shaked, smacked, cursed...nothing, very disappointed!!Bob Buckleytwobucks01@aol.com"
2,Wireless Remote Switch,"Switch worked, but range of remote quickly decreased from the expected range of 20+ feet to about only 3 feet. Put new battery in remote and didn't solve problem. Returned switch."
2,This Thing Is Humongous....,"....as in way, way too big. It does work, and that's about it. Returned it and bought the Woods 13568 Indoor Remote Control which is smaller."
1,did not work for me,"This product did not work, tried it many ways and added new battery but worked only at 2 foot range and even then intermittently. Sent it back, get the Woods brand which did work for me."
1,Cheap/Didn't work as expected,"This arrived very late and when I opened it, it looked very cheap. So it was returned the same day I received it."
1,electronic switch fails easily,"One of my three remote units burnt out after only using it a half dozen times on 400 Watts of flouresent lighting. Control range for remote is not consistent. Sometimes it works from across the room. At other times I need to be 2 feetaway. Battery in remote is not a common AA or AAA. You have to buy an odd ball 12V miniature battery type 23AE, when it is time to replace it."
1,Bought this one as well,"We bought both of these hip hop videos, they were so old school and out dated that it got more depressing to watch as the DVD played on."
2,An uneven read at best.,"This is a book that does not know what it wants to be. It is partially a legal/business thriller and partially a ""buddy book"" farce. It features a group of New York City American Indian friends ,led by attorney Stephen Drum, that go against the mafia, a blackmailer/assassin, the federal government, the New York State government, the New York City government and all of the odds to put an Indian reservation in New York City with an accompanying ""Indian"" casino in Rockefeller Center.The book is frustrating, however, because the thriller aspects are not consistent and the fun ""buddy book"" parts only kick in during the last 50 pages or so. It makes for a herky-jerky read and is ultimately unsatisfying. That is why I am giving it a ""2 stars""."
5,Very nice,"This gives you great gripping areas, a tight fit, seems very well made. I also like the molded color emblems."
4,Still a Demand for the Industrial Engineering Function,"There is a definite demand for this handbook based on the price I would say. Honestly, it is wide-ranging in its scope of the IE function reflecting the diversity of Industrial Engineering in general. I like the concise format for that very reason. I am an old fashioned Motion and Time Study IE and the ever evolving nature of the field based on exponentially improved communications and technology at our fingertips has slanted and re-postured the nature of Industrial Engineering. This new slant is well represented here and is an indispensable source of reference for new IEs and the old timers like myself. I was recently told that an Engineer is an Engineer is Engineer etc. That may be but you still have to say current in your field. This handbook is an invaluable concise reference and a good starting point for whatever diverse topics you wish to review and investigate."
2,How can ANYONE say this is one of her best?!???!?!!!,"This has to actually be the WORST of Kurland's full-length novels. It's so poor, I can't even remember what I didn't like about it without having the book in front of me! I love Lynn Kurland books - I buy every one as soon as I can find it - but her quality seems to be suffering as of late. These characters were rather unbelievable, poorly developed and stereotypical. The plot was draggy and repetitious ... I could go on. I was VERY disappointed. The lone redeeming factor was the momentary flashes of the Kurland talent and humor, but those were few and far between. Please, Lynn - what happened to the splendor of A Dance through Time and the other early books?"
1,Flat and flavorless,Mr. Nicoll's taste is unexceptional and despite the attempt at light good ol' boy tone the book comes across dull and pompous as his music reviews.
5,touch of class,"I have a spoiler on my 2008 gold wing but did not order the risers. It sits just above the spoiler and looks great. The shipping was fast, installation was not bad sense I hesitate to do my own add on, but I did and it went great and fit perfectly. It took me about two hours but anyone that enjoys doing their own add on could do it in half the time. So far everything looks great and is keeping its shine."
5,Making life easy,This book was a surprise to me. Wonderful idea.......easy to follow and helpful for the main colours you'll be working with. I can recommend this highly for new artists.
5,A Complete Gem,"I am in a painting class (my first one to be exact)and I am totally stumped on the mixing (tone, tint and shade). I was looking for a book that wasn't overwhelming but easy enough for a newbie like myself to understand. Well I got more than I bargained for with this fanastic book. It breaks it down to the barest essentials for me. I know for a fact that once I get better in painting this book will always be my go to book because it is such an excellent resource."
1,Manfrotto swivel tri-pod head from Adorama,Paid for but never received. Contacted company but they said they were waiting for product to be returned....so wait...does that mean I'm paying for something I didnt receive? Looks that way! Been over 2 months now and no credit or reshipment. Very pissed!!!
2,"Well done, but..","Selection is way too 'dirge-like' for full enjoyment. I appreciate the master of the singing, but it needs a more upbeat focus in my opinion."
3,Tourch Songs,"Some of the artists are quite good, others little more than fair.I gave one copy as a gift and should have listened more carefully on the internet."
3,The Song of the Machete-Flute,"This is essentially a retelling of myths and archetypes using what seems to be aliens or mutants. Now, bear with me for a second: This book is extremely well-written. I place it in the sci-fi section even though it is more like a fantasy on the surface. This is a world where people actually quote Ringo Starr and treat the rise and fall of the Beatles the way we treat the rise and fall of Achilles. We know it is our world, but something has gone awry. What, we never know.This book won the Nebula and is full of rich, poetic prose. But I recommend it only to those people who love fantasy sci-fi with a good dose of poetic language on the side. For Delany's more straightforwardly ""sci-fi"" novels, see NOVA or THE FALL OF THE TOWERS."
1,"Hei, Customers. This is not a fake comment. Please read this before you order this cheap junk","You will receive 30 packs of cracker all for red dye. Don't trust the photon!They are neither cookie nor cracker.If you want the fat and color additive melt right inside of your mouth, this is the product for you."
2,cookies,this came with only three packs of cookies one of each type in top layer not five each no big deal but I wanted them
1,Does not Fit as per Amazon Part Finder!,"This wiper does not fit a Honda CRV 2008 model as the Amazon Parts finder says. This is wrong information and I brought a wiper and it was useless. There is a metallic curve in Honda vehicles and Anco wipers are made in a general fashion and don't fit! Total waste of money and time... and I have the Amazon Part finder to blame!Anco - 31 Series Wiper Blade, 26"" (31-26)"
2,Doesn't lie flat,"I bought two blades a 26"" & an 18' for my honda accord EX 2004. I was written to be compatible but after I put them on they just don't lie flat against my windshield . The 5"" of the 26"" are off & the 2-3"" of the 18"" blade are off .the parts that lie flat on wipe pretty good other wise it's just annoying especially during rain ...."
4,Good little chainsaw,"I grew up on an acarage selling wood in the winters for extra money, and I have always trusted homelite machines with my sawing. I have run this machine for just over 2 years now and it works like a charm everytime I go to use it. I purchased it in a pinch (my homelite's at my mother's place) after a big storm to clean up a tree that fell on my house (4 hours away). I was initially very upset with this, difficult to start, and difficult to keep running. However, after about the first 2 tanks of gas through this, the little woodshark was earning it's keep. Now it's follow the start up instructions and off it starts, and will run until the tank is empty or you shut it off. I've cut many a cord of wood with this and I reccomend this, a good value for a now occasonal user like me."
1,Impossible to start after a couple of uses,"I bought this saw at a big box store (not Amazon). It worked for a few hours and then quit. I tried to start again and broke the pull cord in attempting to get it to start. Took it back to the store and paid a $50 repair bill. It worked for a few hours after that, and quit working in the middle of a job. It would not start. I bought a new spark plug, no joy. Opened it up to clean the carburetor. It has plastic throttle lever that promptly broke while I was trying to get at the carburetor. A replacement carb runs $25. Not worth the hassle. This is going in the trash.Get a better, well made machine that will not quit midway through a job"
1,garbage saw - don't waste your money,"I bought this saw for my husband as a birthday gift and what a waste of money! He's an experienced chain saw user. I'd read the positive & negative reviews about the saw but hoped he'd get a good one for the price. He only wanted to use it for light brush on some conservation land. After many, many tries he finally got it started. He had to run it at full throttle or it died. The thing (can't call this piece of junk a chain saw) spit & sputtered for about 20 minutes & died. The plastic had melted on the cover, the chain brake locked up & the idle is set too low. He worked on it for s a couple of hours trying to get it running again and it's dead. Anybody want it for parts?????"
1,"Poulan 14"" bar Chain Saw","Hard to crank, wouldn't idle at all until carburetor adjusted. Cuts well if you can keep it cranked. Very aggravting."
1,D L K,This was a very big disapointment. I bought this for small jobs such as trimming limbs. The rope will not pull out all the way 90% of the time jerking my arm back. When I can get it started it will not idle and dies constantly. I was warned about Poulan's but bought it anyway because of the price. BIG MISTAKE! Poulan just lost any future business they might have gotten from me.
4,Poulan chainsaw,This saw was new and was shipped very fast.It seems too have a hard time idleling but cut good.It may get better after it is broke in.Over all it seems too be a good saw just have to keep the gas reeved up.
1,Can't Start Following Instructions,"Poulan P3314 14-Inch 33cc 2-Cycle Gas-Powered Chain SawThis saw is impossible to start. Following the instructions leaves me with a large pool of gas on the ground, but no running saw. I can't return it because I put gas in it. I have a smelly lawn ornament, good for nothing. Poulan should be ashamed, and Amazon should drop this product."
2,hard starter,"I've had mine two years and used it four times. It cuts fine if you can get it started. Hard starting, especially when hot, even if you follow their directions. It won't idle more than a few seconds. I would not buy it again."
1,Wont Start,"Pulling my back out again on a Poulan. Not worth it.... EVER. Would never by a Poulan again. Dont challenge your back, wrist, neck with this piece of garbage"
4,chain saw,It is a good price. It is light weight. This is the second one I have owned and it was very dependable.
3,HARD TO OPEN,The plastic over the cap is very difficult to remove. I had to use a pen knife to do it. And the actual caps don't screw and unscrew smoothly.
3,a good book but not good for a beginner,"Normally, a marked as 24 hours course book should be easy to follow with and easy to learn from. However, Mr.Karlins tried to cover almost everything of Corel Draw 9 in this book, which causes a lot of confusion for the beginner reader."
3,"Not as good as Linda Cook's ""Night Fires""...","...But still an interesting and original read. Cook seems to specialize in historical romances interwoven with distant court intrigue, sometimes with great success. Her heroines are brave, realistic and not idealized to a ridiculous degree, as some authors do. Worth an afternoon's read, but get Night Fires by this author for a better experience."
5,Cool design,This wheel cover is very easy to install if you follow the directions and let the cover warm in the sun before stretching over the wheel. Looks cool with the faux diamond plating and is comfortable on the hands.
5,Excellent,Works great!!! I have a flat roof that does not allow me to add a phone line and the only way to use my satilite system is with a long phone cord accross my room. This jack extension helped me eliminate the long ugly cord
5,I LOVE THIS BOOK!!!,"I have read Montana Sky so many time I had to buy the hardcover edition. My first copy fell apart! You become so involved with the story and the characters that you never want it to end. Everytime I see someone looking in the Nora Roberts section, I tell them to GET THIS BOOK!!!!"
1,Disappointed,"I usually love Nora Roberts books and really looked forward to reading this. Her style and characterization were superb as usual, but the violence and the cruelty to animals in this book really turned me off. Not an enjoyable read, in fact I couldn't even finish it."
1,Greusome,This book I very much enjoyed untill about half way thru where Jess rapes a girl and murders her. The scences are narated so greusomely i wanted to throw up!
2,Some good things but way too many bad things,"Good Things: I like the characters in this book, Will and Ben, Tess and Nate, Lily and Adam; I also like the rural setting in Montana. I enjoyed reading the relationship develop between the three sisters. I also enjoyed reading the relationships developing between the three couples (but I honestly don't think any man would tolerate a women hitting them as much as Ben did).Bad Things: Killing, killing and more killing. I almost put the book down because I was so nauseated reading what seemed to be the endless killing and brutality in this book. I kept thinking yes, I get it, the guy likes to kill animals and people, why do you have to keep tormenting me with the details of each of them.I can't really say why I finished the book, maybe because I like Nora Roberts so much. Many, many of her books are ""keepers"" for me and I have read many of them several times. Got to say, I won't be reading this one again."
3,Good Plot ......too much violance,"I love most books written by Nora Roberts but I have to admit that I was very disturbed by Montana Sky. The book has a good plot and keeps the reader in suspense. However, for a romance, it contains too many bloody, violent scenes, which very often made me nauseous. I'm sorry I've read it."
1,Be prepared for the unbelievable violence,"I used to be a big Nora Roberts fan, but this is a very gruesome and violent book---I was surprised. Nora Roberts writes so beautifully that she pulled me into this story before I realized how vile it would be. Animals and people are slaughetered with quite graphic detail---over and over again. It's horrific. On the plus side, the writing is magnificent and the plot is the best I have seen her write. But it is really, really gruesome. I listened to it on audio (the reader is excellent) and I had to skip many, many sections because they were so vile. I warned you. I am writing to the audio manufacturer and telling them they should put a rating on a book like this for violence and language."
4,Great versatility for the price!,Pharos 505 has great options for the price. Those seeking the combination of full pda capability and GPS should sample the Pharos brand.
2,Higdon Disappoints,"After learning that Jennifer Higdon was the most performed of our current crop of American composers I bought this recording of her work in great anticipation. I must admit that I was greatly disappointed by both the Concerto for Orchestra and City Scape. Higdon clearly thinks that her music must break new ground of ""challenges"" to the listener rather than providing a pleasant musical experience, which I'm sure she is capable of producing. Her music is the type that excites academics and some musicians with irs inventiveness, but fails to captivate a concert audience."
2,Not for sensitive ears,"Bought these thinking they were a cheaper alternative to solid gold but they have proven to be irritating to both my and my daughters' ears. Maybe for those without a sensitivity to non-gold, they would work. They are pretty, but we are limited in how long we can wear them."
3,"yeah right, cooperate in business","Replace competition with cooperation in business? LOL. I would like to see the airline industry begin to 'cooperate' and not be so competitive. Yeah. Cooperate and set prices. Or cooperate and divide up the market. Opps, that would be collusion.The author, Alfie Kohn, should be required to run a business before he writes such a book."
3,A very basic guide,"This book provides some basic guidelines for managing your finances and living frugally. The author lives off of $300k, which may not be practical or desirable for those seeking to retire in comfort in North America (her one trip taking the Concorde to France does not constitue retiring in comfort). Lessons are demonstrated through anecdotal tales of her life, which make for an easy read."
1,Feit Electric EcoBulb disapppoints,"Feit Electric 23 watt ECOBulb BR40 fluorescent bulbs take an infuriatingly long time to warm up and reach full brightness. Also, one of three I installed in my office burned out within ten days of installation.Graham Sterling"
2,Died after one year,"Not like other FML 27 bulbs, the bulb died in one year. Others I still used for three years. It might be a lemon, but I am not happy to buy new one every year. I am switching to other brands. Try other brand."
1,Poor Life of Bulb,This bulb has about 7 months of life. My last bulb (of a different brand) had over 2 years.
3,Not any better than the bulb I replaced,"I bought this to replace my bulb that blinked, fritzed etc. This one isn't any better."
5,It worked out of the box,"Got this for my dad's lamp.Bulb worked in different lamp,but the lamp we bought it for was bad.Will save it for the other lamp,as they are hard to find on the local scene."
1,It broke,"I was originally happy with this stand, however after a few months of use the supports for the main arm both snapped while I was punching. While this did give me the unique opportunity of seeing the steel support bend wildly as the heavy bag continued to swing but I would recommend buying a different product perhaps from a different company as everything I have ever purchased (gloves, heavy bags, heavy bag stands, etc.) from Everlast has broken/fallen apart after a few months use."
1,"Missing parts, horrible packaging","The first time this product showed up at my door, I refused delivery because the package was destroyed and I was sure there would be major pieces missing. To their credit, Amazon promptly shipped me another, but this time I wasn't around to refuse the delivery. The destroyed box was left on my front porch, and, of course, critical parts of the stand were missing. This may be a good stand, but right now I'm still waiting on the parts that will allow me to assemble it and try it out."
5,AD&D the way it was supposed to be.,"This is an excellent book for those adventuring groups that want to take on the ultimate test: Hell. I can also see that the fear of accidentally printing something ""evil"" within the AD&D game is slowly disappearing. New tables detail devil/human crossbreeds and the character kits are excellent. The Hell blade turns your average thief into a deadly devil-battling warrior. A new devil made just for the book is designed for a text book horror movie possession story. The book is excellent for its price, and it's nice to see that at least some of the new AD&D books are taking a more dark and religious path. I can see this book fitting very nicely into a Ravenloft campaign in addtion to a Planescape one."
4,Good personal story,"Good personal story for anyone wanting a glimpse of life for those living in Zaire, now Democratic Republic of the Congo, during the turbulant 1990s and forward. And, as of now, the beginning of November, 2012, it has become a war zone again."
5,Quick delivery and a book to recommend,"The delivery was fast.I have just started to read the book. This reading was recommended to me by other AP French teachers, as I am always on the look out for authentic French materials to use in class. I also like to use reading texts with DVD to optimize students' learning and comprehension. The DVD with French audio is also available. I am pleased with this selection so far, and I would recommend it to francophiles and francophones for an easy and interesting material to read - for pleasure and/or use as an authentic French material in class.A+ :D"
1,Good backseat mirror BUT a major safety concern,I was so happy when I found this mirror because it really works great. I was very dependent on this mirror to make sure my precious little cargo wasn't slumped over which she did alot when she would fall asleep. ON these occasions I was able to reach back and adjust her little head.The problem I came across was when I went to have the carseat inspected at the local children's hospital safety event. The experts immediately told me that any mirror is a serious hazard and that they have seen serious injuries to babies that could have been prevented if the backseat mirror was not installed. They adjusted the carseat about 7 degrees so that baby's head would no longer slouch forward (even though the indicator on the carseat was showing a correct incline). THey said ANY backseat mirror is a safety concern and should NEVER be installed. I highly recommend getting your carseats inspected by the experts.
1,Mirror came apart!!!!,"This mirror was easy to install and I loved that I could rotate it to exactly the best viewing point to see my son. Unfortunately on the second day I hit a pothole and the mirror separated from the base and fell into my son. I am lucky it did not hit his head or face and cause damage!!! I am returning this product, because after several attempts of trying to make the mirror stay on the base I have come to the conclusion there is no way to do so. It was quite a disappointment!"
1,DO NOT BUY - DANGER!,"**DO NOT BUY - DANGEROUS CONSTRUCTION**I too had one that fell apart, and luckly, my 3 month old wasn't in the car-seat at the time. The problem is where the mirror assembly attaches to the ball joint. It's not the joint itself, but where the post on the back of the mirror enters into the ball of the joint. It's glued in with what looks like a Gorilla Glue type adhesive. Between two smooth surfaces. With glue mostly at the tip of the shaft. There is no way anyone should have green-lighted this method of manufacture. It's sad, because the ability to offset the mirror is a great feature, and is the only car-seat mirror I've found that works in my Mazda 5."
2,Worked great until the mirror fell off,"The mirror worked great for several months, then suddenly one day, without warning and without having been touched the mirror fell off of the base. We could not pop it back on. It is a ball and socket connection. Now I have a hunk of junk and have to find a new, better mirror. Perhaps if you know the exact angle you need the mirror at, you can super glue it back in, meaning it would no longer be adjustable, but then it would never fall off again!"
1,waste of money.,"this is just a waste of money. it's nice and worked for a few minutes but it doesn't stay in place like many of the reviewers mentioned. i should've listened to the negative reviews and saved my money. no matter what you do it will not stay in the position you want it to. and although it's a big mirror, it's only big enough for only one person to see the baby if for any reason there is a driver and someone on the passenger seat."
1,moves around,i've tried hard to secure this mirror onto my car seat but it continues to move around. i wouldn't recommend this mirror.
3,Love it then it broke,I loved this back seat mirror! Since I don't have a center headrest it was perfect because it rotated. I adjusted the strap to make it tighter and it ripped to shreds! So disappointed! It was practically brand new too! Great product but needs a stronger strap!
5,"Not sexy, but invaluable","Especially now that they are recommending rear facing until 2yrs, this is a big mirror to see what's happening with your baby. It's super easy to install, no foreseeable problems. Exactly what I was looking for."
4,I want to have it,"I want to buy it, buy I don't know how can I have it.I appreciate you can give a indication!Thanks and best regards,Jean Tsang 04-08-2000"
3,Quirky mixed bag but not bad,"It was good. Something pleasantly wierd, You get the strained scenes but hey, you're not looking for oscar material. The T& A is there. The humerous stupidity is there. Very satisfactory."
4,gomer,"No matter what Jim sings, you can bet your bottom dollar he puts his all into it. This has to go for all of his recordings."
4,Nice box,"The box does not come with any hardware at all. Nor any numbers to add an address. The company I purchased from decided to mail the box in its original container which did not offer any protection. My box was damaged. Other than that, the paint looks excellent, does not scratch easily. All metal. Very deep. I'm happy with this box."
2,Mailbox Front,Will not stay shut! Noted how to adjust from maker.No luck yet.More work on I guess. Overall nice looking for $$$.Will not stay shut!
1,ugh...,"Saw these at my campus bookstore and decided to pick them up. BIG mistake. They hurt my ears whenever I put them in, and no matter which suction thing I put on the earbud, they fail to stay in my ear.You're better off buying a cheap pair of Philips' or Sony earbuds for less than $10 than buying these things. STAY AWAY."
4,"Amazing Quality, Bad Design","The sound quality is, indeed, comparable to products by Shure. However, the earbuds do NOT have marking to tell you which ear they go in which is outrageous (!!). I had to take some nail polish (DIY) and mark the left earbud on the inside. Also, the rubber earplugs tend to slide back and are not loose. The right one comes off and gets stuck in my ear... but the quality is SO good, and the price is SO low (I got them for $9 at F.Y.E.) that this minor inconvenience is absolutely worth it."
2,Great Sound/Short Life,"As the title says the sound that these earbuds produced was great sound (if you like deep bass). They only produced this great sound for about 3 months though; which is a huge problem for me if you pay $20 for them. The worst abuse these earbuds got were bike rides and sitting at my desk at work. Actually I was sitting at my desk when the left bud started shorting out (going from loud to soft, and completely producing no sound). The sound and price make them a pretty good deal, but the amount of time they last makes them a rip off."
5,Good sound and great value,"I bought these after accidentally dunking my Sennheiser CX300's. The sound is quite good. These sound almost as good as the Sennheisers and the Creative EP-630's I have. Maybe not quite as tight in the bass department, but there's plenty of it. Additionally, these will play much louder than the Creatives and Sennheisers, which may not be a good thing. They will get really loud.The cord is of the symmetrical variety, which I don't like, and there is no indication which phone is left and which is right, so you'll have to figure it out if that's important to you.Otherwise, these are a super value and you won't cry if you lose them or tear them up. Get a pair today to replace the crummy headphones that came with your mp3 player."
4,Great for the price,"This is great earphone for the price.I compared it with Sennheiser CX300B and hands down this Skullcandy Ink'D has way more low end (bass) than sennheisers. It feels like you are next to subwoofers. Noise isolation is excellent. The only area sennheiser won is in crisp clarity but not by much.Skullcandy sounds little metallic but other than that it's wonderful... I'm keeping it for bass and quality sound. Oh yeah, in my lowest volume of laptop, it's very loud... these are very efficient...Cons: Noise from cable when it rubs against clothing is noticeable."
2,Left? Right? Almost impossible to tell,"Beware that these phones are NOT marked at all for left and right. As one user noted, you can (sort of) tell by looking at the cord splitter, making an assumption the logo should be in the front, and then disentangling the wires to trace the left and right cords to the buds. A royal pain, IMO. These are the first phones I've bought in a long time that don't have left and right clearly marked on the buds and, because of this, I would NOT buy these again and am looking for a replacement pair."
5,Great for the price!,"I use these to listen to my electronic music since they give off better bass than any of the simple over-the-ear headphones I have. It took 2 hours at most to get used to the weird feeling of in-ear headphones. The sound quality, like others say, is quite rich too, I'm just really impressed by the punch of bass these tiny things give out. This is my first time reviewing an item on Amazon, I just had to make sure I got my good review in there."
2,thin sound.,This product is way too expensive given the quality.I recently bought the $20 J-buds and the $6 Coby's. Both sound much better than this one.
2,Too much,"Talk about purple prose! Way overdone. Didn't like the ""hero"" - he had no real depth, simply a too typical arrogant leading man. And the head-hopping, point of view switches from paragraph to paragraph left me dizzy. Couldn't get halfway through the book."
4,Great For Dish Receiver - Caller ID,This is a great inexpensive solution if your satellite receiver is caller id ready and a phone line is not close to your television.
5,Well I'm impressed - UPDATE,"I can understand people being frustrated if this item was purchased for a modem. There is nothing on the box that states the baud restriction. However, for a fax or phone system it works great. Open the box. Plug the one with two RJ-11 jacks in by your phone plug and plug in the RJ-11 cord. Plug the other one where you want your jack and plug in the RJ-ii cord At this point you will have dial tone. The almost new house we purchased was built by peple who were running out of money. Solid construction, no landscaping and no cable/voice jacks. I plan on buying another one of these.UPDATEMine stopped working after four months"
1,Good Service,"The wireless Phone jack I bought did not work after a few days so I sent it back for a refund. But the customer service of Smarthome was very very good. They stood behind their product, and offered a full refund or exchange. ............The Customer service was fantastic !!!"
3,Reasonable starting point,"The Praxis II is an intimidating exam. It is more difficult than the study guides let on; however, this book offers a reasonable overview. I would use it as a place to start, but NOT exclusively. Start with one of the many study guides out there (borrow one from the library for free) then move on to finding a good overview book in each catagory...geography, poli sci. etc. The study guide tests (this and other praxis II study guides) also serve as a way to test which areas need additional review. Good luck!!"
1,Don't Waste Your Time or $$$,"I totally agree with you, as do many others. It is a very hard test that should be looked at by ETS and reviewed by the board. I wonder what the statistics are on the pass/fail rate on that test and what the average score is on the test. Buying this study guide will not help you, it is just another money making way for ETS. I had to take the test and the best way to study is to buy class room books and read through them. That is the only true way to passing this test, or getting lucky."
1,Terrible!,"What a waste of money. This book offers only outlines,no ""Content Knowlege"" is reviewed whatsoever."
2,disappointing,"This toy laptop from VTech is overall disappointing. The screen is tiny and dark, and not in color. The lack of color would be ok it the screen was backlit, so you could see what you are doing, but it's not. Besides not being able to see what you are tryig to do the (many) games are lame - illogical and difficult to play - provided you can figure out what in heck you are supposed to be doing in the first place! My daugher was so excited to have her own laptop like Daddy's, and at first glance this toy is super cute, but as soon as she started trying to play it became clear that it was going to be difficult and frustrating, and she quickly lost interest. There has to be a better toy laptop out there! I wouldn't recommend buying this product."
4,The same features as vtech laptop-pink or orange,"My daughter likes it. It is an imitation of a computer and it is plastic. For under 20$ not so bad.The only complains that I have are:-the keybord goes: abcdefg-alfabetical order instead of qwerty one. I would prefer if it had qwerty so my kids can learn where the letters are in the real computer,-you can't just write without sound-like notepad, I think they both would play with it more if there was an option to write,Last one, this notebook has the same featueres that cheaper Vtech latop has it just looks more like grown-up computer.I am happy with this purchase."
3,Wings and Things,It works great but is very small capacity. I gave it as a gift and she says she likes it.
4,Old School Hot Rod Charm,"Just like the covers I put on my high school hot rods. Company should make covers for more modern, thicker steering wheels, though."
1,Misleading information,"I was wanting a stearing wheel cover for a 18"" wheel for a 57 Chevy. The cover I purchased said that it would fit my wheel. When I received it there was not way to get it to streach over my wheel. I tryed several ways to streach it to fit, but it split apart and was unuseable."
4,Tea Bag Foldiing,"I have done tea bag folding for several years and enjoy the craft. I have taught classes in this art, and will be teaching another class soon. I know my students will enjoy the samples and instructions contained in this book, and will get excited about learning the craft. Tea bag folding makes a beautiful product to be mounted on a card for that special friend. I highly recommend this book."
4,A good start to an interesting series,"From the mouth of my 11 and a half year old daughter: I have been interested in Greek Mythology for a long time, but have never read about the Odyssey before. I got the whole series for Christmas and this book was a good introduction to the whole storyline. It made it easier to follow the rest of the storyline in books 2-6. It can be read alone, but makes more sense if you read all of them. The book itself was a little too ""young"" for me (like Magic Tree House paperbacks reading level) but still had enough information for me to learn about the Odyssey. Took me only two days to read the series. Summary - good story, but too simple/easy for anyone over 10."
3,by AK,The title of this book is The One-Eyed Giant by Mary Pope Osborne. The main character is Odysseus. Odysseus is a very clever man. The setting takes place on the island named Ithaca. The problem is Odysseus called to war. I think this is a great book. When he gets so close to Ithaca and then his men made him start where they started. People who like Greece would like this book. I would give this three stars because it is a little scary.
5,CMBH's Friend,"Christopher- I really want a copy of this, please. I am sure you have some valid points to make. I have not received your letter yet, and hope to in the next couple of days. Court is not the answer to everything, is it? It would be better if the courts were fair. Blessings to you!Joy"
4,Good remote,"I bought this to replace my old very dependable RCA 450 that finally bit the dust. I have an ancient Panasonic TV (20 years plus) and a very new Panasonic DVD/VCR recorder combo. It took a fair amount of time to get the new Philips to recognize my TV, but eventually it happened. However, twice it recognized the DVD/VCR when I was programming it for the TV. Eventually I understood how to override that tendency, and Voila!, the channel on my old Panasonic TV actually changed. I still love the RCA remote, but I think this is a very good replacement, especially for the price. Plus, the Phillips has the DVD functions on it which the old RCA did not have. (I still have the original remote control for my ancient TV and it still works just fine too. I needed the extra remote so that I can control the TV from more than one location in the house.) The Phillips is a good deal!"
1,didn't work,I have a Comcast cable box and an Olevia television. This remote after two hours could not be made to work.
1,Disappointing,I bought this thinking that it would be a good replacement for the multiple remotes hanging out in the living room. I am disappointed that after a few months the buttons have stopped working correctly. You have to reeeeaaally push down on them to get them to work.Skip this remote. Invest in something with more quality.
5,Nice book in good condition.,This book has all the information you could ever want about the history of figure skating.Very nice book.
1,"Bad Story, not worth picking up even from a Library","I found this book very boring, I read about 150 pages and then skipped to the end, here was a woman who didn't trust men, but then believed all these stupid excuses the hero of the book gave her, come on.I wasn't even interested enough to find out the end which is very unusual for me. I'm sorry I wasted my money buying it."
4,Ska,"I'm not a ska expert, but this record would probably appeal to people into The Selecter. Every ska band with a female lead sounds like The Selecter to me... and these guys are no exception. There's some ska, some reggae, some more dub reggae, some ska.If you are into the Mighty Mighty Bosstones, you might skip this one. If you are into the VGS, maybe you'd like this. If you're into Hepcat, odds are good."
4,Ruined Xmas gift,"My 14 year old really wanted this and of course I bought it for him for Christmas morning reveal. My door bell rang and there is was the box saying exactly what it was my son is very happy about the gift and I am pretty pissed off about the way this was shipped. So thanks alot amazon,maybe you should state that this item is shipped in an original box so you don't destroy anyone else's christmas present surprise."
1,Work well only if you maintain well,"First of all, you need to fasten your bolts at least once a month. If not, the plastic part will crack.The reason I gave it only one star is that they provide you only 60 day warranty. And they did not provide me information concerning maintenance.!!Do not forget fastening bolts constantly. They inevitably become loose as you hit the bag. It will very shortly crack when the bolts are loose and you hit it hard.!!"
2,Not what you might think,"Documentary, not the ""Action/Thriller"" I was expecting when I searched for ""Action/Thriller"" and this came up. Famous people are just voice overs. This is pretty boring, and not worth more than $1.99 to rent."
2,Narcissistic and Technically Flawed...,"The early part of this docudrama is awesome with many treasured movie captures and well presented reenactments of the truly wondrous exploits of George Mallory. However, the cameo representations of the gear that Mallory and Irving had at their disposal while trying to compare it to the gear that Conrad had for his comparison is insulting. Conrad's successful accent of the second step and then offering that his accent could be justification that Mallory MAY have done the same is totally LAME. Conrad had better gear, he arrived at base camp in a JEEP for goodness sake! His outer gear, his crampons, let alone the visual evidence that he had chalks with his nylon rope totally make an insult to the allusion that Mallory could have made it because HE (Conrad) DID! A good beginning but a totally self serving narcissistic conclusion..."
2,Hokey!,"Light as air fluff contains vignettes about an alien world of sentient teddy bears who enjoy American popular culture. Not as entertaining as it sounds, and even the opportunity for parable style social criticism is wasted."
5,Wonderful Service and speedy delivery,"Who'd a thunk... being able to obtain the Duro-med Universal Walker Glides from Amazon (or through Amazon). The product was delivered at a rather rapid pace AND put to work immediately. The Product is sturdy BUT after much use on a walker they DO need to be replaced and it is a great pleasure AND service to be able to find them at this site AND at a relatively better price than from most medical supply stores. For any one using a walker these gliders work so much better than the ""Tennis Balls"" that many people put on the rear stands."
2,didn't fit walker,Purchased along with a walker that they were recommended as a go with. Very disappointed that they didn't fit as I expected.
1,Poor quality,These are lightweight and poor quality compared to others we have purchased locally. Tried to save some money but in this case you get what you pay for
1,"Great Concept, Poor Fit","Purchased the Duro-Med Universal Walker glides along with the Duro-Med model 500-1053-2100 2 wheel walker per Amazon recommendation to purchase together. Great concept,but unfortunately the glide stems circumferences where a bit larger than the steel tube legs of the walker. Required grinding down the glide stems to make them fit into the tube legs which took some effort to make them fit. Obviously, the term ""Duro-Med Universal Walker Glides""were not manufactured and sized to fit the Duro-Med model 500-1053-2100 2 wheel walker.The end result was satisfaction once I resized them to fit. Great concept, poor fit."
2,This knife travels while cutting large breads.,"I'm a professional chef and decided to try out this cheap 10"" scalloped blade knife. It can cut well but it cant cut straight. When cutting a slice you should never try to twist your hand or force it to make it a straight cut. But you have to do this with this knife because it will give you a wedge shaped slice of bread. This is because of the tapered angle on the blade, both sides of the blade should have the same angle but on this blade, one side is tapered and the other side is mostly straight. This is a common manufacturing method for cheap home knives. If you have this blade just look down the blade from the end and you will notice the angles. I will stick with my professional knives. A good way to fully test this is to cut a large fruit with it. Try cutting a melon in half with this blade, it will truly drift off by about 2 inches. lol"
2,NOT GOOD FOR PHONE USE...,"It's a good PDA, but not as good as the Tungsten/T & not good for wireless phone, especially with the SMS features.These are following cons that I encountered with Tungsten/W:1) You cannot delete the call history.2) You have to delete the SMS outbox and inbox messages one by one.3) You cannot send the SMS messages to a group of contacts, you have to do it one by one.4) It's very difficult to write a SMS messages using the qwerty keypad.5) It is not a MMS ready and cannot play polyphonic ringing tones.6) There is no time indication in the SMS messages inbox.7) You cannot answer the phone without the earpiece.8) You have to charge it everyday, the talk time & standby time is not long as what the manufacturer claims.9) Doesn't have a bluetooth & speakerphone.I hope Palm Inc. will do something about this or else they won't get a bigger share in the PDA Phone market."
1,Would be great if it was not for only AT&T....,"Sharing the sentiments of a previous poster, I too was duped into purchasing one of these devices. I like the device itself and find it to be a nice system. It's very quick, and the user interface is crisp.However, I travel internationally all the time. I bought this unit to replace my dual-band Treo 270. It's not that the Treo was not cutting it; it's that I wanted a tri-band PDA. Imagine my surprise when I called in to get the unlock code and they told me, nope, you can't have it. I quickly asked for my RMA number.Too bad. If Palm would recognize that the market for cell phones is a commodity-based one, with people using SIMs so that they _can_ switch phones easily (thus the idea of a SIM card in the first place), they'd get a lot more sales. I hope AT&T; paid them a good bit of money for the exclusivity. If not, ...they are losing sales. Like mine :-("
1,Run and hide. Don't let the palm man get you!,"I bought one of these things 4 months ago. It broke. Palm won't fix it. Palm want's 100 bucks to replace it. Palm wants me to use a on line form to pay up front and start a repair order. Palms on line repair order cgi script doesn't work (makes you wonder who does the programing on the palms. Palm says write back to us and we will start a SRO (service repair order). Did that about 4 weeks ago, haven't heard a word.In shortThe worst warrenty and the worst support of any company I have ever delt with."
2,The Palm Tungsten W as a phone is lousy,"The phone reception, although loud, is often scratchy. The sim card can only be used on the Palm phone. Consequently if you have a problem, you may be out of a phone. The service for the Palm Tungsten W is mediocre at best."
3,Gripping,"I read this book in my early teens and I must say, it is the only book I have ever read that I literally had to read from beginning to end and couldn't put down at all, not even to go to the bathroom. My mother had to keep dinner waiting for me for over an hour because I absolutely had to find out what happened and could not wait a second.I'm not a suspense fan in general, so maybe this is normal for a suspense book and this one isn't all that great after all. It certainly has no literary merit."
3,Excellent Thriller,"I really liked this book. It was really exciting and kept me on the edge of my seat. Don't Look Behind You is by Lois Duncan. She is an excellent author. I like how she portrays the characters and sets the story up to where everything falls into place at the end.This is just one of the many books I have read of Lois'. Every time I read one of her books, I just have to keep going back for more! So, next time you want a book that will keep u guessing and attentive, I recommend Don't Look Behind You, or any of Lois Duncan's books."
1,"BAD, REAL BAD",I was forced to read this book for my 7th garde literature class. It is perhaps the weakest attempt at a suspense novel I have ever seen. Do not buy this book unless you're looking for one that will send you snoozing afer chapter one.
4,Interesting concept. Hard to put down!,"April is a really amazing character, even though at times, I was shocked by some of the things she did. This book was really interesting and if you have read any other books by Lois Duncan, you will love it!!"
1,"I wanted to put no stars, but it wouldn't let me.","I was so excited to get a Table-Mate II for my husband. I got one before we were married and I am in love with it. However, the one I got from Amazon was not a Table-Mate II, but a really cheap imitation. They sent it in a Table-Mate II Folding Table box that had been crushed and looked well used. The Table-Mate II I had purchased for myself several years ago has the logo on the back of the table, this one does not.It was really cheap and you couldn't even get the table to be flat it was insane! I was really upset that Amazon could let things like this happen. I sent it back for a refund and I will be getting this product from a different website."
1,not what i expected,"I bought one table mate some weeks ago , and i was a terrific item , strong , good quality and pefect packaging.when i recievd this one, the chasis is thinner and weaker,the pack was open, however the name of the product is the same Table- mate II- is the same !Iam desapointed and confusedDiego"
3,"product is good, price is higher than other vendors","I gave my tablemate to my brother and now that I am in needof one again, I saw this on Amazon. It's overpriced considering thatI bought mine on a regular price of $10 (not on sale, no coupons used)4 years ago. Yes, 4 yrs ago, but hey. It shouldn't cost this much."
5,I've had Table Mate II for over 2 years and I love it!,"I haven't left reviews for many products but when I saw the negative reviews for the Table Mate II I felt I had to set the record straight. I am in no way connected with the company that makes or the places that sell Table Mate. As for the negative reviews, the only thing I can figure is they're talking about Table Mate I (which I've never tried) or some other brand completely. I've had the Table Mate II for at least 2 years and use it daily for my laptop and occassionally for eating on. It certainly can be set perfectly flat. I wouldn't recommend leaning heavily on it but I rest my hands/arms on my laptop while I type all the time (like now) without a problem. It has held up superbly to my abuse. I'm extremely happy I purchased this and am planning on buying a couple more as gifts (one for my fiance who likes and really wants one like mine)."
5,The most helpful table you will ever own,This table is so helpful. I have 2 and use them all the time. It is easy to work on this table or use it for any reason. It is the table for anyone who eats in front of the tv or does any work in a chair. This table will go flat to hide under the couch or bed. I have found it very useful.
1,"Table ""not on the level""","Either we received the wrong parts for assembly with this unit, or the unit is poorly designed. Assembly is easy . . . but it was impossible to set up this particular table so that the top is level when fully assembled. Adjustment has the top tilting down or up, depending on position. Not very good if you are attempting to use the table to set a plate and glass or cup on for an easy meal. Slants at about a 10 degree angle. This one is not on the level."
4,Table-Mate II Tray,Very versital with many choices for height. legs allow you to pull it right up to ones chest. Love It!!
1,Table Mate 2,First of all I returned the product because of the condition it arrived in. The plastic table top was warped. The bracket that adjusted its' position was also warped. Very flimsy. Would not suggest it although it is a nice idea. Just not made properly.
4,Storage with the bent legs....,"Storage with the permanent bended legs is a little inconvenient. Other than that, it's a great TV or Computer table. Your legs are free from bumping the standard criss x cross TV table legs and it's much sturdier. The hight selection is great, as well, just a little hard to get both legs working together as you have to do one side then the other. Would recommend this table."
3,TableMate Review,"Works fine... does not hold heavy items (laptop computer) well... sort of 'gives' under the weight. Also sits a tad crooked, new from the box"
4,Good,I love my tablemate. I have wanted one for a long time and now I use it for everything. It comes in handy when I have to stayup in bed and do school work.
3,"Works great for light loads, but be careful when placing anything of significant weight on it.","I bought the table to eat on while I am on the toilet. It is nearly perfectly level, so my bowl full of cereal doesn't spill. But when I place my large gaming notebook computer on it, it starts to bend, even though it is well under the 50 pound weight limit. I simply move my notebook as close to the front edge as possible and that seams to significantly reduce the bending. After a couple of weeks of alternating heavy and light loads, my bowl of cereal still doesn't spill. I would not use it for writing; its surface is not smooth, and it tends to wiggle and bend downward when I try to write on it with my other hand trying to hold paper in place.The table is stable; I have not tipped it over by accident. It does fold-up as advertised. The locking pins that hold the legs in place are easy to push in for adjustments with my stubby fingers."
1,false alarms,"Sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't. Too many false alarms . I wanted it for outside near front and back door. Sometimes I had to walk pass it several times to get a response! The alarm to me is not very loud which I like a loud alarm. Also I had to get the reciever and sensors practically next to each other at times to work! Don't get this alarm. I recommend ""The Driveway Patrol""."
1,Sensor wouldn't work,Sensor did not work straight out of the box. Made in China and it's a huge p.o.s! BUYER BEWARE! I returned it right away to Amazon. I wanted it to work and tried everything but it is defective and it is brand new! WOW
3,Howdy Doody - early days?,This was evidently the early days of the program. Howdy referred to Buffalo Bob as Mr. Smith and the show was set in a circus atmosphere and not more western as the later shows became. There are a lot of commercials which I thought were odd.
5,This collection makes my Christmases bright!,"I am a big fan of this group and can not say strongly enough how well their performance comes across on their recordings. I have heard this collection in person and on the CD and they are always great! The conductor has arranged many of the tunes and always adds something new for the listener -- familiar tunes seem to take on a new life. Among my favorites on this collection are the title song, the ""Ave Maria""(an arrangement I had not heard before), and ""The Sheperds' Farewell"". All of the songs lift the spirit and put you in the mood for Christmas (although I have listened to this collection in the middle of the summer). I highly recommend this collection to music lovers and to Christmas lovers!"
3,Disappointed,"The quality of the recording is muddy. It was recorded in a cathedral for the luxury of the pipe organ (not a portable instrument!) To be fair, the music is done well and I enjoyed learning new choral arrangments, but the recording is not clean and crisp. I'm sure it's a nice memento if you saw a great live concert of the group, otherwise, skip it."
2,Not for everyone,"I chose this based on reviews. The first 3 days were fine. 1 pill twice a day. Drank at least 8 cups of water. etc etc. 2-3 healthy BMs. Day four my stomach did a complete and horrible flip flop so as the label instructed, I stopped taking it. Unfortunately I did not have a BM for almost 5 days after that. Not fun. Took another pill hoping it would get me back on track and it actually did but not going to take anymore. Everyone's bodies are different and mine unfortunately did not react well to this pill."
2,Super Cleansing Dud!,"I took this product as directed for 3 weeks and NOTHING truly happened. Initially, I had a little rumbling in my intestines and had watery stool for about a day and then absolutely nothing happened after that. My intestines substantially cleansed after one day, I do not think so, so I'm moving onto another cleansing process."
3,PRODUCT IS JUST OK.,This product is just ok nothing special I took 6 a day until the product was all gone. Ok.
2,flimsy and unstable,"as appealing as construction + Dora sounded, I'm very disappointed at this toy's instability - even on a tile floor, the tree is easily knocked over, the tree top is difficult to attach (even for me, let alone my 5 yr old). I'm encouraged that my daughter wants to be creative and put the parts together in other ways, but it's not very flexible, i.e. the ladder will not ""stay"" as a bridge because the bride stairs are not stable enough to support the weight. in general, it's a great concept, but a ""platform"" piece is needed and Mega Bloks would do well to implement more real-life testing before releasing the item."
4,"Duro-Med Walker Multi-Pocket Pouch, Denim","This product is well designed, constructed, and adequate for the intended purpose. I recommend this product to all who are interested in having water bottles, etc., with them wherever they have their walker."
1,Beware!!!,"Although the perforamnces are reasonable, the other reviewers failed to warn potential buyers that the track ""Jerusalem - And did those feet in ancient time"" credited to Blake and Parry only uses Parry's music. Some genius in the mid 20th century decided he could improve upon Sir William Blake's inspirational poem and replaced his words with his own puerile rubbish - that (for some bizarre reason) is the version recorded here (hence the different track names in the listing)."
2,This product does not tingle as much,"As I expected. It's slightly runny... Causes a bit of a mess when you use it, but, it smells fantastic. Also, the photo says it's a seven pack. I received one from the seller. Questionable. I think so."
4,Love it!,"I bought this cd after seeing Dan Zanes on Noggin and an interview with him on 48 Hours or a show like that. My 7 year old daughter and my husband and I all love it. My one year old son is too young to sing along with us but it makes him happy. Our favorite is Bushel and a Peck, which my Grandma used to sing to me and now my Mom sings to my kids. This is a great cd for anyone that likes to sing along."
3,dated as hell but enduringly cool,"a little prog, a lotta pop, good singing and playing and catchy songs that stop short of going to far into their seventies hole. if you have a weakness for that sort of thing then these guys are a find worth checking out."
3,"It's great for the moon, not much else","I actually did not pay for this product but selected it as an award for years of service at work. I was excited to see just how big the box was and to get it set up.The reflector quality when viewing the moon is awesome, with the barlow lens attached it is very good however that is where the good news ends.You can make out shapes of the planets but that's about it. Trying to view objects such as the Orion Nebula or the Andromeda Galaxy all you can make out is a fuzzy blur. If you try to adjust the scope you overshoot the objects due to how sticky the mount can get. I've tried using various products to improve that but so far no luck.If you get this scope I would recommend replacing the three supplied eye pieces with a higher quality eyepiece as the ones that ship with this are of low quality."
5,Deanna's latest is a wonderful suprise for the unitiated.,"I challenge anyone to listen to this album and keep still! Deanna Bogart is a gifted and true musician who very naturally and effortlessly makes that piano sing as an extention of herself. Combine her with a consummate corp of professionals behind her and you get a very tight and confident arrangment that gets your feet tapping at the very least. Her lyrics ring of genuine sincerity, and invite you in to share her most private emotions. Buy this album and be surprised, and don't miss an opportunity to catch her live."
1,John,"Not accurate at all. Measured the same object several times and the digital readout was never the same twice, it varied 3/16"". This one's going back!"
2,Difficult to use,"I liked the idea, but these are not easy to get out of the tray either without breakage or some part of the ""stick"" remaining uncovered. So they work as a stick of ice or frozen drink, but they rarely look very good. Sorry."
5,Good,"Husband love it he didn't think I could find it, he was surprised could not find it in the stores"
2,A bit below average for the genra,This is a typical fairy tale plot told in a pedestrian manner. The characters are rather flat. I found it disappointing having read and been impressed with one of the author's short stories.
3,A little too soft for me,"Ms. Lippincott is a celebrated organist and her talent is great; however, I find her works lacking strength and boldness. I bought this CD because I live in Durham, North Carolina, and attend services at Duke University Chapel. I love all the Chapel has to offer, mainly its impressive set of organs. The Passacaglia is good, but overall I don't think the Flentrop was put to the test."
4,Those Glorious Arches!,This is a marvelous collection of in-depth reviews highlighting the differences at McDonalds across the Far east. In some small ways it can be used to aid in understanding the many varied customs of countries of East Asia.
3,Not a bed - but a mat that works well ....,"when a 5# / 10 yr. old Chihuahua wants to settle in Ur lap [4 hours] while at computer. The non slip backing is an asset - wrap pet in a 'baby fleece blanket' or small fleece throw and lay pet onto this -Roll up like a hot dog - or fold like a Taco - keeps the dog level along the spine, head and neck straight and your arm from going dead as their head rests on this.Do feel it needs to be corrected in the advertising, word BED removed, but I was able to tell by photo that it was a mat only -"
2,Not what I expected,"This mat is too thin, the anti-skid backing doesn't prevent skidding, and the ""fur"" sheds and gets all over everything. My beige carpet is covered with little pieces of black fuzz, and it's hard to clean, even with a powerful vacuum. Must use the hose attachment. Doesn't offer much comfort or padding to my dog. I wouldn't buy again. Sorry!"
4,SOFT,"My 7Mo old Beagle/Terrier LOVES this mat, she will whine until she can get in her crate to snuggle and lay down on it. Very sturdy too, she has chewed on it a bit and NO TEARS, my other one became like a snow storm of white fluff lol."
3,"OK, but not essential","I bought this in a rash of purchases for our new cats, Jack and Bobby. To tell you the truth, a towel works just as well as this in the carrier. Or, you can buy fur fabric at the Joann for much less."
5,so soft,"When we first got this bed, I thought it doesn't look fluffy enough. It can't possibly be comfortable for the dog. Then I took a better look at it and it is so soft. Its not very thick or fluffy, and it doesn't need to be. Its a nice bed, and it was a great price also. I'm happy that it can be machine washed and dried. Accidents happen, and our last dog bed we had to throw out right away when our puppy had an accident. I don't have to worry about that with this bed."
3,"Seemed great to me, but my Siberian Husky thought ""Wait... This is delicious!""","I give this 3 stars because I thought it seemed great, and I definitely received whats described. I put it in my ""Black 49"" Triple-Door Suitcase Style Folding Metal Dog Crate with Metal Pan - 49""(l) x 29""(w) x 32""(h)"", but my Siberian Husky preferred the metal floor. I'd assume because the metal is cooler, and her coat provides all the fluff she needs.Once she decided that the metal floor is better she invented a new use for this mat, and turned it into a play toy. It was destroyed in minutes... perhaps less than minutes.In terms of size it was perfect for the above mentioned crate, which is why I got it. For a 40 lb Siberian Husky she fit well on it; not too big, not too small."
4,Perfect for my purpose.,"This is not a bed, but a pad for a crate or in my case, to lay on floor to cushion floor for older dog. He seems to like it. The pad tends to slip on carpet, but for my purpose, it's just what I wanted and is better than laying big towels on the floor. I haven't washed it yet, but being able to wash the whole thing was high on my list of needs. For the money, I would buy again."
2,crate pad,"Quality is not great for the price, would not buy again. You can find a similar item for less money and better quality."
1,little,"please understand that this is nothing more than a thin rug. i thought it would have some girth to it, it does not. my own fault. that being said, it has be durable. :)"
3,Inside information,"this book gives good insight informaiton into the techniques of handling a mountain bike. It is interesting to see descriptions of techniques that have been gained through years of trial and error.It gives an opportunity to refine techniques that have been learned . It would be difficult for a novice biker to apply the information directly. Practice is essential. A few more practical excercises would be good, Mr. Overend. All in all, a good read."
4,Actually has a plot!,"I very much enjoyed this book. There are so many romance novels out there that are so predictable and fluffy that it was refreshing to read one that actually had a story line. It wasn't just a man and a woman falling in love and getting married 2 weeks later.Michele Albert has definitely worked her way up my list. This book was smart and original and I highly recommend it. The main character, Emma, was not your typical damsel in distress waiting for her knight in shining armor. She was strong and sassy. Bobby, the knight in shining armor wannabe, was adorable and I had real feelings of sympathy for him during his rough times.Wonderfully written and a delight to read!"
4,Palise 20 Piece Comforter Set -- Definitely Worth the Money,"A very economical item to purchase, especially with the 2 prs. of curtains w/matching valances and tie-backs. The material is pretty thin, but for the money, it is a great buy and looks rich. The bed skirt has a pleat in the middle of 3-sides, which gives it a designer look. However, the color is definitely not a blue-grey. It looks more like a cross between a celery green and a light sage green (with gold accent). I was pleasantly surprised by this, since I initially hesitated to buy this ensemble, mainly because I was trying to get a way from the color blue."
3,Percolator Review,Very nice coffee percolator. Very attractive for use on the table with dinner or after with dessert. Keeps coffee warm but not hot; lacks On/Off switch. A great improvement would have been a delay timer capability.
1,Broken within 3 months,"I bought this percolater because I trusted the Cuisanart name. However, I had 1 filter left in a package of 100 and was getting ready to make coffee. I picked the pot up and the black bottom section separated from the top portion. On the bottom of the pot a plastic piece had broken off causing the separation. I handled it with care following all manufacturers directions but it still broke.It made wonderful tasting coffee quickly but after 3 months of use was definitely not worth it."
1,Coffeepot,This coffee pot is terrible. Most of the time it doesn't perk all the way and we throw out the coffee. I sent one back already because I thought it was broken but the second one is doing the same thing. I have spent alot of money in wasted coffee and am totally disgusted.I do not recommend this to anyone.
2,Good while it lasted,They don't make them like they used to! It would be nice to buy a coffee maker that lasts at least one year. It made good coffee but quit after 7 months!!!!!!!!Definately not worth the price.
2,dissapointed,I didn't like this coffee maker because I didn't like the fact that it didn't maintain a high temperature in the pot. so I put it in a closet.
1,"Good pot, weak coffee","Just doesn't perk long enough. The coffee is too weak. You can add more coffee, or pour the first cup back into the basket, but that kind of defeats the purpose of spending $60 on a coffee pot. Next."
1,3 months - stopped working!,"First...makes a weak cup of coffee. We had to double the recommended amount of grounds to get a decent brew. Used it every morning for the past 3 months, and today, it just stopped brewing... Our Farberware percolator only lasted one year, and we were hoping Cuisinart was a better brand, obviously not.Do yourself a favor - don't buy it - it's no better than a regular coffee maker - they don't make percolators like they used to.We are going to go back to brewing on the stove with our tried and true Bialetti !""Made in China"" may be cheaper for the company, but at $60 for 3 months, it's not worth it for the customer."
1,Looks nice but doesn't work.,"I purchased this product in the fall of 2010. It was replaced with a new unit by Cuisinart in July of 2011 as it had stopped heating and percolating. That new unit also died after displaying the same symptoms in April of 2012, and I returned it again as was still under the original warranty.The second time around they replaced a fuse and sent it back (wouldn't it be nice if we could still replace our own fuses?). Although it functions, the cycle is shorter and the coffee isn't great.If you're looking for a good quality percolator, keep looking as this one isn't it. A product that fails twice during the warranty period is just not acceptable. It's my time and money every time I have to package the whole thing up and walk it to the post office, so purchasing a more expensive, quality unit in the first place would have been cheaper in the end. After this experience I doubt that I will every buy another Cuisinart product."
1,Junk,"I am sorely dissapointed in this coffee maker. It seems that not matter what I try, different grinds different brands, I cannot consistently get a good cup of coffee out of this pot. Many times I wind up with ""brown water"". Its hot brown water, but brown water neverless."
3,Great But Only Lasts A Year,"This percolator does make wonderful coffee and my husband likes the percolater much better than the drip-type coffee maker BUT it only lasts for about a year. Our first one lasted twelve months and our second one about fourteen months (technically still working but it barely bubbles and the coffee is very weak). We've also taken it apart and done a quick fix but that doesn't work for long. We will buy another one because we like the percolator (like the previous reviewer we're not going to bother with the repair route), but be aware that this pot will only last about a year."
1,Does not work as advertised,"This is a great idea that has not yet come to be a fully working product. Phonex Broadband (makers of NeverWire14) neglect to advertise that each of the modules need to be on the ""same electrical circuit"" within the home for this to work. Just because you plug each module into separate wall outlet locations does not mean it will work. I have 14 different circuit breakers in my home...the chances that the area that I wanted to cover was on the same circuit with the cable connection were pretty slim."
2,"Read ""All You Need is [ouch!] Ears"" instead.","There is very little here that isn't also in George Martin's earlier and much superior (and ungrammatically entitled, alas) ""All You Need is Ears"". The stories retold are altered, seemingly to jibe with Paul McCartney's relentless post-Lennon rewriting of Beatle history. Veracity aside, this tends to make them banal and humorless.Recommended: PENTATONIC SCALES FOR THE JAZZ-ROCK KEYBOARDIST by Jeff Burns."
2,not what i ordered,"I had the same problem as another reviewer I ordered the super sport grip hoping it to be thicker and received the sport grip. There are also three different sizes (A,B,C). I received B and it doesn't even come close to wrapping around the steering wheel of my f150. I'd return it but I only ordered it to get free shipping."
2,Good with some critical flaws,I have the original Gamma 100 drop weight.Flaws:1) It is ok if stringing low tension. Anything higher than 57 is quite stressful to the wrist because of the rotational rachet design.2) Nylon clamps slips! after some usage. Please go for metal clamps. I wasted 10 years of my tennis life on inconsistent stringing - I wish someone had advised me not to waste time on Nylon clamps. The worst thing for a pro or a beginner is to get inconsistent stringing results and scratching their heads.I graded this 2 stars as there is a better alternative.Check out the Flex100 from Eagnas I am using now.It's linear grip with metal clamps.It has also has 2 flaws - but not as critical:1) The linear grip gets gritty and does not return to original position. It does not bother me - I still can use it.2) Racket cannot rotate 360 degrees freely once mounted.I still love it as it has been with me for last 4 years and it does not slip:)
1,Crap,I'm reading other reviews and their giving them 5 stars even though they're ripping their hands to shreds and can't get the clamp open. I guess they are just interested in saving a buck. I couldn't even get started with mine. I could be an idiot but my strings were getting shredded by the sand paper gripper. It's a piece of crap in my book.
2,Confusing,"I love asian ghost stories as a rule, but this one was so twisted that it made no sense at all. I found it boring and confusing."
2,"Part guesswork, part history","This proves to be a pretty interesting effort but I think it fall bit too short for my taste. I think this book was geared too much toward the general readers. Much of the information seem rather generic in nature and book as a whole, don't say too much. For beginner level Roman military history, its a pretty passable book but for experience reader like myself - and perhaps like some of the previous reviewers, I found the some of the information pretty questionable, unproven or simplistic. There seem to be little source to the facts given and as previously reviewers noted, there were two 10th Legions and there seem to be no fact linking Caesar's 10th to the 10th that took Masada!! There are other books far superior then this, try again."
2,Overwritten and Kindle Edition is Horribly Transcribed,"The good: This is inherently interesting subject matter, and the author seems to know it backward and forward.The bad: The writing is pretty stilted, and the structure is pointlessly disjointed, using hackneyed cliffhanger techniques to try and get you to the edge of your seat before veering off to another time and place to give back story. It's so bad that I originally thought the Kindle book was broken.And while we're on that, the Kindle book IS broken. The transcription is lazy and full of errors, from fonts that somehow make words get cut off, to what were obviously end-of-line hypens in the printed version appearing mid-sentence in the Kindle Version.Really sloppy, and the publishers should be ashamed to have presented this junky version as an e-book. How hard is it to properly format an ebook? I sent Word and HTML docs to Amazon all the time that come back properly formatted for a kindle."
1,45 watts is less than a light bulb's warmth,I doubt 45 watts is enough to significantly warm a towel. Read the reviews of 100 watt towel warmers. The towel warmers with more than twice the heat output warm at best a few inches of the towel.
2,Towel warmer,"Our bathroom is really small and this over-the-towel-rail heater seemed ideal. But it doesn't really do the job as it's hard to get the towel to fit over the warming bars. No instructions or information came with the box, so didn't really know how to place the towels correctly. Also didn't get very warm. Pretty disappointing really"
1,This item does not work at all.,"I got this as a birthday present for my wife. It does not work at all. You can barely even feel the warmth with your bare hands. There just isn't enough power in it to be useful as a warmer. It MIGHT accelerate drying a little, but I really dont' think it would help in that area much either."
5,Priceless,Another priceless gem from Brunton. Another cornerstone of my spiritual life and bastion of my spiritual endeavor.. Used everyday for total uplift and inspiration.
1,Five year PA Author,"Yep... I got burned by the PublishAmerica machine and now I am doing my best to get my contract canceled. After five years of trying to come to grips with the fact that my book is overpriced, unedited, and if you do happen to order it, you may never get it, I see that they just raised the price to an unbelievable $24.95 for a 212 page paperback! OMG, I can only hope that my suspicions are correct and the economic downturn is sinking the PA ship! They have been desperately offering 2 for 1 sales, free shipping, and now hardcover editions at softcover prices... which in reality, arent! Run, dont walk away from PA, authors!!!!!"
1,poor quality,"I have had one of these tapes for about 2 months and when I let it coil a couple of days ago, the tab at the end snapped off. I've got a Stanley Powerlock 30' that is 12 years old and still works like it was new."
2,Academic Writing for Grad Students,"I didn't have chance to use it at all in class. Anyway, even though it was used book, I thought that could be in better conditions. Next time, don't put as used VERY GOOD how it was. Be honest about the conditions."
2,Good for a single parent,I bought this book for my daughter so she can write about her journey through her pregnancy but it asks NOTHING about the father. She writes about the dad anyways but Ive seen alot of books thats clearly has space for the dad on his background and his feelings etc. This book has no space to write information on the dad. This book would be good for someone that doesnt have the dad in her life.....
5,"If you are pregnant, buy this book right away!","I highly recommend this journal. I was surprised how important it was to write while you are pregnant. This journal really helped me sort out my feelings. I bought it on a whim and I was glad that I did. I bought this journal is primarily for myself and maybe less for the baby, although my daughter may one day find it interesting reading, when she is pregnant. I also bought her a thorough baby book, so that is really more for her. This book is about being pregnant, which is often not written about by the mom. Usually we focus on baby more and not our experience of pregnancy. It is worth the money. It provokes you to write, as it is a fun journal. You may find it more fun to write in this than to stare at a blank journal. I highly recommend this book. Buy it right away, if you are pregnant. I really wouldn't wait until your 3rd trimester. It is almost too late by that time! Buy this!"
3,Good but needs a little more,"I like the guided prompts in this book and I've used one for both of my children. However, I really don't like the photos in it {I'm not a fan of naked women, even if they are partially ""covered""} and I also thought it was interesting that there are all kinds of prompts for the mother but none for the father - as if he's not really a major part of the child's life. It does the job, but I don't love it."
1,NOT WORTH YOUR TIME OR MONEY!,"There is nothing but low life filth on this CD! If it were possible to ban CDs from the market, this one should be banned! Medieval Madness? No way! More like Ghetto Madness. The ""music"" has nothing to do with medival music at all. A 1 star rating is too high."
1,Product satisfaction,"Poor in antiskip, hit a little bump and it skips. The sound quality is not as good as the alpine model."
5,Just what I wanted,"This is a great tray. Fits both wheelchair and power chair. It's clear, heavy plastic so you can see through it. Only drawback is that the person in the chair can't put it on easily, though might be able to do it if they're very flexible. Excellent for eating. Also good for reading and holding hymnals at church. Highly recommend."
2,Illustrations need more work,"Wiring diagrams are poorly done. They need total revamp, especially K3-K7. Also many photographs need better exposure/different film to give more clarity."
4,Clymer Honda CB750K 1978 book review,"A good book with detailed explanations, many drawings and some B&W pictures. A must when working on that bike. A bit old school though, a new edition with colour pictures would be real nice. I might have to get Haynes book to complete this one."
4,Manual,"Don't expect this manual to tell you how to do everything. For example, it will say things like remove fuel tank. Well, it's not hard, but one has to do a little exploring and experimenting to figure out how to do that. It definitely helped me do the work I needed (cleaning the carbs), but I wish it had just a little more information."
1,Poor Quality - S-Video is DVD Only,"I experienced a poor quality picture with the VCR portion and returned the unit. I was also disappointed that the S-Video port was only for the DVD. Apparently most combo units are built this way - Buyers beware, if you want the higher quality of S-Video make sure the VCR portion has S-Video. The ""spec"" is misleading because it says ""S-Video"" port but does not reveal that it is only for the dvd. I will not buy ""Go Video"" again."
5,You get more than what you pay !,"This is my first binocular. I had earlier used a 4""newt and8""dob. But never actually went out and used them. The setup andassembling takes some time with the scopes. Recently in my UStrip, I bought this very cheap binocular. I stay in a lightpolluted city and I must say , this binoculars have done wondersto me so far. I was easily able to spot M7,M6 in Scorpius. M7 istruly a beauty through this binocular. With help of some starcharts I was easily able to get the dreaded ;) M31 in the focus.This binocular is really amazing. The optics are pretty good.I rate it 10 out of 10 ! The bushnell site as well as amazonmentions it does not have the socket adapter which is wrong.It does have it. You need to unscrew the cap between the twobarrels , it has ""Made in China"" printed. I am soon planningto get a neat L adapter. This is well worth the money."
2,Came broken,"I previously owned a pair of these binoculars and they worked great. I was just going to replace them with a new pair but these game broken, they caused double vision because the lense was out of place. had to return them and buy a different pair that worked out much better"
3,Clumsy,"They are not easy to use. If its just you, then no problem, but if you pass them around, there might be a problem. These are not your father's binoculars.I do like the wide angle, and the lenses don't distort, so they're worth the bucks."
5,Good for the price,"For the price, these binoculars have served me well. They focus well enough and the zoom is good. I didn't want anything high end or expensive, just something I could pull out to look at things now and then. Comes with a case and plenty of caps. Well worth what I paid."
1,Bad collimation out of the box,"The product I received could not produce a single image. The collimation is out of alignment, and there is no adjustment. Objects appear doubled, no matter how the binoculars are adjusted. I had to return it."
2,I Thought Bushnell Was A Quality Product,"I bought these thinking they would be a good investment. I don't use them very often, so I thought they would last a long time. They broke where the zoom feature is. I am bummed."
5,Pure quality,"I've not had that many binoculars and some of them of unknown brands, but when I saw through this binocular the image was so clear and sharp that my eyes didn't belive. Lightweight and strong builded, nice zoom 10x and the focusing system Instafocus is far more practical and quicker than those from other binocs.I have bougth four of these as gifts and the quality is a constant. I recomend these Bushnell binocs with my eyes closed."
4,Thru the looking glass,"These Binoculars would be great for ball games, Boy Scouts, Hunting. They focus fast and would be easy for all ages to use and have fun with. At this price you are getting something you will be happy with. Clear viewing for a low price."
4,Pretty good.,"I enjoyed Yancey's Monstrumologist series so I thought I'd give this a try. It is a well written, fast paced read and I enjoyed it but I thought it wasn't as high caliber as the Monstrumologist."
2,Original packaging,"I was very disappointed that the original packaging was NOT included with disks.. Only the plastic DVD Holder, and nothing else. Nothing even said that it was the Star Trek Voyager Season 4 except the disks themselves, and the seller never mentioned this at all. However, the disks played fine. So I gave 2 stars.. Otherwise would have sent them back."
2,This doesn't make any sense,"OK, i understand that voyager has to try to be as peaceful and cooperative with alien species to get back home... but they are willing to allow B'elanna to undergo some weird alien memory erase procedure? come on, just put her back on the frigging ship and move on. so in short the plot doesn't make any sens.as a side note the conversation between Neelix and Seven. Seven criticizes how the federation interacts with other races with ""insufficient understanding of their nature""... wtf!?! shes a Borg they scan a ship, and then either assimilate it or ignore it... and we just got done with the Borg-species 8472 war, which the Borg completely failed at because of their ignorance in only being able to understand things that they assimilate.this episode is just another why bother; a dialogue that was probably inspired by George Lucas (ergo terrible) and a plot line that makes as much sense as America's political system."
3,Very Ambitious...Very....zZzzzzZZZz,"A good start -- Seven going through her daily routine and so on and Omega happens. I was actually excited for a second; secret directives, classified info, smoke and mirrors, mysterious ""God"" particles. But then the story just faceplants and tumbles down a flight of stairs into a garbage pail. What a let down.And *spoilers* let's talk about that riveting ending?... ""and it was destroyed and the aliens were never heard from again and Voyager was safe and everything turned out perfectly. the end."" That's not really spoilers that just every end to every Voyager episode recently *teleport to end - everyone safe - show no resolution or how they solved the problem*"
5,A True Gem,Fusion? Electronica? A jazz classic? All three I think. This music is hard to label. A combo of funky space jazz is the best that i can think of. Way ahead of its time(1974). A true gem emerges at the right time.
3,spout to short,the funnel is huge but the spout is way to short. it doesnt work great as whats the point of filling the huge funnel if it has no where to go...silly design
4,This thing is huge!,"The reason i ordered this was because the gas cans i have all suck. They all leak. No matter what brand i buy, they all leak at some point. This thing is huge, and will catch just about all of the spillage. When i say huge, i mean this fits on my head, with plenty of extra room.Seems plenty durable, and quality made."
4,"cute and cuddly, but collects dirt.","i got this lion as a lovie for my 8 month old, and boy has she loved it. just this morning i gave the lion a good washing, and she insisted on taking it with her for naptime even though it was still damp.my one complaint about this lion is that it gets dirty very easily. dust, lint, leaves, almost anything small gets tangled in the shaggy fur. and once tangled, it's impossible to get stuff out again, completely anyhow.so, in summary, this little lion is great as long as he's not intended for outside cuddling or anything too messy."
3,Poor packaging,"The service from Amazon was as always good. Sadly, I installed the step bars fully using the fixing kit to my Dodge Ram. I did not remove the bubble wrap covering the steps until fully installed. When I removed from both steps there was impact damage to the side of each step. The box it arrived in was not damaged but can be described as well beaten so the package must have taken a beating during delivery. I did not remove the steps and continue to drive around with a 1"" sq dent to each step."
2,Not as good as I had hoped,I purchased these for an Alaskan trip. These would better at a concert. I needed something stronger. They are a good travel size
3,okay,"for the price they was okay for hunting, and it rain on me one saturday hunting the binoclar was great."
2,Junk!,"I'm giving these binoculars two stars because the price is so low. It's hard to complain about 25 dollar binoculars, but I will anyway.The glass is very foggy. It feels like I'm looking through plastic toy binoculars. After spending 10 minutes with these, my eyes feel tired and strained.Also, the quality is so poor, that they won't stay focused. The dial that allows you to focus the right eye is very loose, and requires constant adjustment.Yes, they were cheap... but what is the point if you can hardly use them?"
5,"Magical binoculars, contain phlogiston","According to the specifications, these binoculars weigh 11.3 ounces.According to the product details, they weigh 4 ounces, for a shipping weight of 8 ounces.Which is it, or do they actually have a different specified weight as opposed to product weight? Is their inertial mass the same as their gravitational mass?I've given these binoculars five stars because they seem to have magical properties. It would be great if they weighed 4 ounces for carrying, but had a good solid 11+ ounces for stability when viewing."
3,slight ly dissappointed,"these came in a few days and were in time for Christmas which ws faster than promised. However, after just one hour of use, one of the eye pieces has fallen off. I plan to send them back or see if this is how they are supposed to work."
4,More of a mystery than a love story,"Unfinshed business was more than a mystrey story than a love story. dont get me rong it was good and full of suspense, but at times i got confused if it was supposed to be a love story or a mystery! i do recommend this book!"
5,Finally Finished,"After waiting so long for this book to be released, I ran out to get a copy on the release date and let me just say I loved Christy and Alex's story. Well worth the wait."
5,Perfect for Fixing a Car's Headliner,"I used this item to fix the headliner in my van. It was starting to fall in a couple of places. These twist pins are an inexpensive, quick, and easy alternative to paying for a headliner replacement. They screwed in very easily, they hold the headliner up very well, and don't look that bad. Of course, you can see them, but it is really not that big of a deal. I recommend this item."
2,Couldn't wait to approach the last page...,"Definitely not on my list of top Shakespeare plays. So many people LOVED this play and even deemed it as their favorite. Uh... uh... I don't get it? It contained no real substance. I found my attention drifting far away from the text during the 15 minutes I devoted myself to it each day (I couldn't take any more than 15 minutes! I just couldn't!). However, there were some good elements in it. I can't really think of any off-hand, but... yeah, I'm sure there were. Hehe. Just kidding. I liked how all of the lovers finally got everything straightened out. Especially Titania. I about peed down my leg when I found that she was in love with a donkey. Read it, you might like it. But then, you might not. :P"
2,Black and white cover,This product came very quickly but the cover was black and white not like the picture. The book was in fair condition.
2,Repetitive and unrevealing,"This book is typical of Childress' books--mildly entertaining, but ultimately vaccuous. Chldress gives credence to every half-baked rumor and legend while failing to provide any level of decent support for his basic premise. If you're soldiered through his some of his other books you'll find material virtually rehashed word for word. If you like a collage of hodge podge stories and fabrications, you'll have fun enough but don't expect much in the way of substance."
1,Truly awful,This is not a history book. History books document their sources and reflect on why the author believes something and not something else. This was a recital of everyone else's theories with some reference to acknowledged fiction.
1,Kept falling out,"Why would I wanna shove these big hard waxy bricks in my ears? Maybe I should cut 'em in half. Ehhhh, not worth the trouble. Thought I'd try something new. So much for that idea."
1,what happened???,"I used these earplugs for about 30 years. About 5 years ago, the wax content steadily declined and the plugs became hard and unusable. They used to be the best on the market, but now I find about 9 or 10 of the 12 earplugs in a package to be worthless."
5,Very well worth having!,"2001 Amazing Cleaning Secrets is a purchase that will pay for itself. It will help you save money on using professional cleaning services by letting you in on the cleaning secrets of the pro's! You'll learn about how dry cleaning can actually (in some instances) be worse for your valuable possessions than running through a washer. Furthermore, this book will help you save lots of time with methods that instantly short-cut housecleaning like magic.This book is a real find, and would even make a good gift for newleyweds or college grads going off on their own!"
2,LOTS of effort!,"Do not try the cross stitch that requires two needles! After an hour and 15 minutes I was only 1/3 of the way done. At that point I was at the first ""spoke"". I could not make it look right and gave up. If your steering wheel has wide spokes I don't think the average adult male has a chance. I used to use this product years (25?) ago and was generally satified with the results, but I sure could not make it work with a modern steering wheel."
1,Not what I thought,"I thought that this would be a great book written by THE Douglas Adams, author of HHG2G and well known atheist. Wow, was I mistaken! Anyway, I've got nothing against this book. I just want to make sure other people don't make the same mistake I did."
5,This is the best cd!,"There are a ton of great songs on this cd, Wild Wild West by Will Smith is the best one. I listen to it everyday and i love it!!!!!"
4,review Makita 2012nb,A solid machine right out of the box...with a little fine tuning this machine is well worth the extra cost. Surprisingly quiet. One improvement would be to make the dust port attatchment(not included) out of a stronger material than flimsy plastic. I look forward to using this tool for a very long time...it seems like it was built to last..
4,"Smooth cuts, issues with dust collection","I had a portable Delta planer which was a workhorse but finally gave out after over 15 years of moderate use. Did alot of research and found that this Makita planer was consistently rated highly by users. The quality of the cuts and the set up right out of the box have been great. I have planed a couple hundred board feet of hard maple, and the Makita performed extremely well. Smooth cuts and plenty of power. The only complaints I have so far relate to the dust collection. First, I can't understand why you have to buy the dust collection hood separately. Second, the outtake on the hood is an odd size (I use a shop vac in this part of my shop for dust collection) and my hose does not fit very well into the hood. Other than that, I am very pleased with the planer. I would recommend it to any woodworker who is looking for a high quality medium duty planer."
5,Still Planing Perfectly after the First Year,"I wrote a very favorable review of the Makita 2012 NB Planar last January when I first used mine. In the review I said I would follow up after one year and give a progress report. The machine is really outstanding. I have no trouble completely preventing snipe by just keeping the last few passes very light. Changing the blades is simplicity itself. With the optional dust chute installed, the mess is reasonably well controled (My wife appreciates that). With other newer models coming on the market from competitors, this is still close to perfection and deserves a serious look if you are in the market for a portable planer."
5,very nice,"This hand creme is just lovely . . . .It smells very nice, a bit indescribable , and never leaves your hands feeling greasy. I would use it all of the time but I didn't buy enough the 1st time out. So now I will buy more and my hands will feel great all of the time."
4,Nice size,"It's the perfect size for turkeys and large roasts. It's a lighter stainless than I hoped for. The utensils that came with it are cheesy, but functional. I would spend more next time on a heavier model."
4,Not as bad as I thought...,"This set is not as bad as some of the other reviews would have you think. Sure, it's not as luxurious as other comforter sets out there, but what do you expect at this $27 (sale) price? The color is a dark gold and is a couple of shades darker than the online picture, but not too shabby. All in all, worth the price I paid for it, with free shipping too."
3,Rough Exterior / Soft Interior,"In general, I liked this comforter. I bought it at a great price when it was on sale so I really can't complain. But, I would say the top of it, the material, is a bit coarse. The inside layer, the part that would touch your skin, is pretty soft and silky. I've used it for our guest bed and it looks nice - pretty much like the picture."
2,Very choppy reading,"I was excited to share this book with my kids and am easily pleased with a children's book. This book was so choppy and not well written. There are so many wonderful childrens' books, don't waste your money with this one.Try ""You Are Special""."
4,bushnell sent new pair first one was damaged,When I received the binoculars all I could see was double. Sent them back to Bushnell direct insteasd of the seller. I paid for the shipping back to Bushnell. Bushnell sent me new binoculars (free shipping) and now I see only one of what I am looking at. Very clear and so far so good.
1,Poor Quality - stay away,The focusing on these binoculars is HORRIBLE! The right eye focus was very touchy and would not stay in one place. I had to choose between the left eye and the right eye as they would seldom both focus at the same time. The Insta-focus would move on its own. This is the most disappointing Bushnell product I have ever seen!
1,"this isn't a book persay, it is a blank journal you fill in.",This journal has the same beautiful photographs that were featured in Horse Follow Closely. It has some questions to jog your brain. But it is filled with blank pages. A pretty notebook or diary would work equally well and be less expensive
1,Save your money and buy a notebook at the local discount store!,"I was so ticked off when I bought this book. The title "" A JOURNAL from the author .. . . "" This is NOT a journal FROM Gawani Pony Boy - it's a blank book!! Waste of money!"
2,Listing needs sizes,"The listing really needs to list sizes A, B, or C because you get what you get in the mail and that's not good enough. People need to have the option to choose their steering wheel thickness. I had to pay for return shipping for my refund. I may call Amazon and get my money back for the shipping simply for the inconvenience.The best way to order a leather steering wheel cover is go to eBay and search Wheel Skins. You have unlimited color choices and you're directed through a size selector for your make and model of vehicle. Wheel Skins cost about $50 but there's no hassle and its a superior product.Lately, I'm not happy with Amazon's model for allowing sellers to throw non matching products up in the Amazon provided listings. Beware when you buy a MacBook pro."
2,Far too difficult to install,"The cover is nice, but the process of putting it on requires far too much effort for my liking. You have to thread it through with a needle, and it is a very lengthy and difficult procedure. I failed to install it, and I would not recommend this product to anyone who does not have sewing experience."
5,Entertaining & accurate; better than fiction.,"Dave Brown has really done the necessary, comprehensive research. His description of Great Lakes' shipping is 100% accurate. The reporting is factual and not embellished with contrived dialogue. I was an engineer in Great Lakes and ocean ships, one cited in the book, and can visualize the events he described and emphasize with the crewmen's situations."
1,Cheap!,This product was a disappointment. The small plastic pieces started to crumble from the first use. Spend a little more money and buy something more substantial!!
5,Another part of the great Korean HS horror series.,A recurring theme is again done with intelligence and skill.Great HS girl dialogue...realistic in content.One question...are all the girls in Korean HS beautiful? And even the ghosts are 10s.
4,ABOVE AVERAGE QUALITY FOR OUTSTANDING PRICE,"My father had a fillet knife very similar to this one. It has lasted a generation and then some. I have no reason to think this knife will do anything otherwise. I recently used mine to cut up a huge portion of filet mignon and it worked like a gem.PROS:1. Walnut handle actually provides a very slip-resistant surface for your hands.2. Blade extends through the entire handle.3. Arrives nice and sharp and seems like it will hold an edge well too.CONS:1. Blade composition not as rigid as other blades I have used before.IN SUMMARY:At a price of less than $10, it is hard not give a good rating. The knife does what it is supposed to and looks great. Had I paid more for the knife I would have given a lessor rating because of the rigidness issue I mentioned earlier."
4,I'm Impressed!,"I have had this set for about a year now. At first I was a bit concerned the blades seemed a little thin (I thought a nice set should have thicker steel). However, unlike every other cuttlery set I have owned which became dull after use and difficult to sharpen, this set sharpens to razor sharpness very easily again and again! It's the best set I've ever owned."
3,Why No Dried Shrimp in Som Tam and Pad Thai?,"I'm afraid I have to respectfully disagree with some reviewers here about this book. To list a recipe for Som Tam (green papaya salad) and Pad Thai without dried shrimp is not ""Real Thai"". I would comfortably say that these are omissions made to avoid offending westerners.Also the layout is a bit thick and not very friendly...that's not to say some of the recipies are OK.The real tip off, though, was the missing dried shrimp in the Som Tam and Pad Thai as it makes me wonder about what else was omitted from the ""Real Thai"" recipes...."
3,"Good, but not as great as everyone else says it is","I purchased this book after reading the others' reviews on how great it was, and to a certain degree those reviews ARE accurate: good Thai recipes, good explanations for each recipe, clear directions, optimized for an American kitchen etc. It didn't have a bunch of my favorite recipes, though, and I'm back on Amazon looking for something to fill the gap.However, where this book REALLY lacks is organization. The author decided to split recipes up by geographic origin (i.e. Northern Thailand, etc.) which is a good, but she FAILS to give a master list of recipes and categories. In each section you have appetizer, entrees, and desserts all mixed together with no delination between them. The alphabetic index at the back is OK, but not great. This book is a good introduction to Thai cooking, and for that the price can't be beat, but if you want something more comprehensive and better laid out then look elsewhere."
5,Good and Detailed,This book covers the topic in a such a way that both beginners and people with more experience can benefit. Written and explained in such a way that the novice will understand but detailed enough that someone with experience can get a better understanding of things they might not have encountered in their work. It covers electricity very well so that one will go away with a better understanding of it. All in all a very good book on the topic
3,Not bad,"I have another set of barbecue tongs which are similar to these but have a sturdier release. However, these seem to work fine and overall I'm happy with them. They are just a little more difficult to operate one-handed than my other set."
2,Meh,"The photos contained in this book are very dated and you can find much better online for free. The pictures in the book can often be difficult to make out exactly what is what. My professor allowed the use of tablets, laptops, and smart phones in lab to access the internet for better pictures. If your instructor is willing to do that as well, then skip buying this book."
4,Photo atlas,"This book came the fastest out of all of them. A few dogeared pages, but over all in good condition."
3,Very Similar,"This show was enjoyable on DVD, but Erasure's other Live DVD's are very similar. I enjoy their over the top, campy, and nutty productions, but I don't need to have every live show DVD after owning 3 of them. If the song lineup is significantly different, then the DVD would be worth buying."
1,Doesn't fit,"I have the 18-250 lens for my Sony a700 and this fisheye lens doesn't fit. It even came with an adapter ring that isn't listed as needed, and it still doesn't fit."
5,Funny Story....,I canceled this order and did not receive the items. But I can say without fear of contradiction that these are paper bags. Open them and you can put stuff in. You'll then be able to carry them around.
3,A book for the surreal thinker,"People who buy this book should realize that what they are buying is a visual essay with sub-titles...not a piece of lengthy literature. That is not to imply that this book isn't any good. It's actually very thought provoking for people who actually think! The book is loaded with photos and illustrations juxtaposed with BRIEF TEXT. The goal of the book is to offer a surreal opinion about the moral and emotional motivations in our society. It's also poking a very accusing finger at the advertising world.If you're the kind of person who can solve this equation 5 + X =10, then chances are you have the mental abilities to fill in the blanks and produce the message that Byrne is trying to communicate. But if you're the kind of person who needs the message spelled out to you, then chances are you won't enjoy this book. Simply stated, this book is like looking at a piece of art...""some imagination required."""
1,Waste of money,"Frpm what I can tell these sound OK, but I can't really hear past the crackling from the short in the cheap cord. Just don't push the volume past 2 or the bass clips.Be careful when you pick them up, the ear pieces fall off every time you pick them up and you will start thinking the thin thread of cheap cord holding them together is going to rip apart, making them unusable."
4,"Good hub, average value",I have successfully used this hub in conjection with a SpeedStream 5660 router to provide an ADSL connection to three computers. But keep in mind that the Netgear EN-104TP 10-Base T-Ethernet Hub 4-Port will get the job done for 26$.
2,"You might as well run around without a helmet, if you wear this thing.","At my Dojang we use padded weapons during sparring. One of the students I teach bought this cheaper version of a ""guard mask"".We use padded actionflex swords during sparring, and they slide right through the visor of this helmet. Also this ""helmet"" lacks a neck stabbing guard. This ""helmet"" is a severe safety hazard.Thank goodness we noticed the fluke of the helmet, before the student got severely hurt. If you are looking for a padded helmet for weapons sparring go for the Century model."
3,Works but....,"I purchased this product to transfer audio from my tv to my home theater system and also to add audio from my ps3 to my home theater system. Everything works perfectly, but when watching tv, their is a two to three second gap in audio every once and a while (could be every other minute or could only happen once a day). I haven't figured out what the problem is. I don't know if i recieved a faulty box or if there is a problem with the output on my tv, but it always happens when watching a show and you are waiting to hear what someone is saying of coarse.If this didn't happen this product would get 5 stars from me. It does seem that I am the only one that this is happening to though, so it must be something on my end."
3,"Sometimes ""Aw Shucks"" Cute Is Not Enough","Babies unreels the first year of life of four new members of the homo sapiens tribe. From Namibia to Mongolia to Japan to the USA, the babies are adorable, naturally, and fun to watch as they begin to develop their personalities, which remain remarkably consistent three years later when, in a bonus feature on the DVD, the film maker visits the four families three years later. They poop, throw small tantrums, get into slightly dangerous fixes, and learn to stand and, in some cases, walk. But, for me, Babies relies too much on gorgeous exterior shots of Mongolian open space and feels awfully long despite being under 80 minutes. Think of it as a home movie times four that proud parents sit their guests down to over after-dinner coffee."
2,A Wasted Opportunity,"I'm not sure we learned anything new whatsoever about birth, child development, parenting, or even foreign cultures. Personally I found the music to be extremely intrusive, spoiling many moments that did work. Why not just focus on the gentle sounds of the babies and family members? Finally, the 3 mothers (and one pathetic dad) chanting and singing ""the earth will take care of us she is our mother"" again and again cast a long shadow of absurdity...it being a clumsy, shallow ""message"" in a film that otherwise takes care not to force feed us messages."
4,Good instructional tool,I showed parts of this movie while teaching a college course on human development. It was a good tool because of the world-wide perspective and lack of narration. But as entertainment I don't know- might be a little boring for most people to watch what is essentially a silent film for an hour and a half.
5,the best book for middle school girls,this is a great book i read it and it took me1 month to read this but it was worth it its a great book for young girls
2,Sonic Fidelity and Build Quality Fall Short,"I bought these Panasonic RP-HV152 earbuds on the recommendation of most the reviews on here. I also bought the Sony MDR-E818LP as well.The four star average rating (as of 6/16/09) is way overrated. I would say these headphones are more 2 star.Sound: very thin, complete lack of bass, and very little detail. If you compar an well-recorded track with the use of cymbals and compare them to a better set of headphones, you will notice the lack of sound quality in these headphones. That said, these headphones will work fine for uses like talk radio, kid activities, e-books, etc. where fidelity isn't required.Build: thin wires, not a great connector, and very light cheap feeling earbud housingsThe Sony headphones for a four bucks more are much much better than these in sound quality and build.Rating: 2 stars"
4,Great sound for a modest price,These ear buds are better than the ones thatt came with my IPOD. A great buy for the money. They sound better than earphones that I have paid twicas much for.
3,GOOD earphone but bass needs work,"let me just say this: it does the job fine however if your looking for a affordable earphone with DEEP bass, this item is not for you. the volume can be loud. however the bass is sorta midranged. i personally prefer deeper bass. i also find myself orienting the earphone just to get its full potential, which can be irritating at times. keep in mind im not saying this is a bad earphone. its actually good, but NOT GREAT, far from excellent. overall satisfactory of this item is a solid B-"
1,Great... for about a month,"When I first got these I was really impressed because for the price the sound was decent, and the ear buds were very light and comfortable. I use them mostly for working out at the gym and they stay in my ears really well.That said, about a month after I got them, one side stopped producing sound, and the same day the other side went out as well. I hadn't used them in a few days, they were just sitting on a shelf. No damage to them, they just stopped working. I contacted the seller for an exchange, willing to give them another shot (maybe I just got a dud?), but no answer so far."
3,"so-so buds, but cheap","these are slightly better than an ipod headphones. Not as good as basic Sony buds.Weird, because my other Panasonic headphones all sound WAAY better than these. Thetreble is not quite as accurate and the bass is moderate at best. The best featureis that the earbuds are very lightweight and I can barely feel them."
5,Nice fit and sound,When it comes to pro's and con's - I don't have any cons for these ear buds. I am real happy and recommend to all.
3,Good sound,"The headphones respond well to all equalizer settings. Sound is very clear, very clean but after long use they can get uncomfortable. They are are, however, more comfortable than the original iPod headphones and they also perform better than the original iPod ones."
2,The audio quality is horrible,"I don't know why anyone rated this anything higher than 3 stars. I buy things on Amazon based on its extremely high rating among its users and buyers, and I was really excited. However, the audio quality of these earphones are seriously bad. Not hissing and popping bad - NO BASS AND ARTIFICIAL SOUNDING bad.I don't know. If you don't care about bass in your music, I suppose these will work. I'm sorely disappointed because my iPod earphones must have spoiled me. I can't believe something that came with my iPod works miracles compare to these things."
4,Eat Candy and Save Money,I bought this toy for my grandson who had seen it in the store and wanted it for his birthday. We all had big fun with it at his birthday party putting money in and selecting our candy. The M&M's don't fall real easily but the bars drop perfectly. He can save money and get a candy treat at the same time. I would recommend this toy but the adults should watch over them so as not to break it forcing the little windows.
3,"Interesting read, however a little thin on the details...","As good as the information seems, the proof is always in the footnotes; and the references in this one are few and far between. Where the author fails us is in his haste to tell the whole story in one sitting. I would like to see a ""Sword and the Shield"" version of this book-with the attention to detail and footnoted references to verify the information and facilitate further research."
1,"for lack of ""0"" star option",Bottom line: this is not what you'd expect - 90's Russian mafia in the West stories. I was duped into... by the title 7 years ago... and pissed of by the good reviews which I saw now.The great robbing of Russia and the spill-overs into the world have nothing to do with the hoodlum stories of this book.Publishers do that: once a topic gets media attention... publish anything related.CRAP!
2,sensationalism,"Let's not mistake sensationalism and truth. Just because someone has dared to say something controversial does not imply that we should appreciate his/her views. Just for the education of the other folks who posted comments here, the caste system placed the kshatriyas with all the power and not brahmins. All the 3 so called higher castes were responsible for propagating the system. Let's not take an escapist attitude of blaming a group & washing one's hands off the dirt. The only solution lies in our getting over our prejudices - be at against the traditionally oppressed or anyone else. Ultimately, the book fails to convey the importance of Ganesha to an Indian household and the sense of joy & festivities that revolve around Ganesha."
1,Sex sells in Theology too!,Looks like the author has taken the safe route of using sex as means to sell his freudian theological theories. If trunk of an elephant can be a limp phallus - what will prevent other theologians theorizing jesus as a sex starved son of a god (after all Mary was a prostitute). Paul B. is setting a bad precedent for serious western christian theologians here.
1,"Ganesha, Lord of obstacles, Lord of beginning","This book is insensitive to Hindu faith. Lord Ganesha is always depicted as having a fat belly. He has short stature and a face of an elephant. The author (Paul B. Courtright) has taken the liberty of ghastly speculation on Lord Ganesha.On page 111: ""Ganesha's broken tusk, his guardian's staff, and displaced head can be interpreted as symbols of castration.""Page 111: ""Both in his behavior and iconographic form Ganesha resemples in some aspects, the figure of the eunuch.""Page 111: ""Although there seems to be no myths of folk tales in which Ganeshas explicitly forms oral sex; his insatiable appetite for sweets may be interpreted as an effort to satisfy a hunger that seems inappropriate in an otherwise ascetic disposition, a hunger having clear erotic overtones.""These are outrageous speculations."
1,Vaughn Monroe CD,I received a damaged copy. I requested a new copy. It was never sent. I then contacted Amazon directly and they sent me a refund.
3,Easy Read,"The best thing I can say about this book was that it was a very easy read. No confusion...chapters flowed smoothly. I did have a problem with the fact that Chester was made at the end to be somewhat of a nice guy avoiding the fact that the book started with him beating his wife. The whole plot with Carmen & Desiree leaving the state when they thought they had killed Chester was very lame. It just didn't make sense that they would leave when it was self-defense. However, the book is somewhat entertaining if you're looking for light reading material."
4,"Excellent novel - human, touching, beautiful.","I can't remember the last time I wrote one of these reviews. This novel was just that gripping and beautiful. It is infused with details of love, with poignant smells, and it promises to break your heart. If you have ever loved and lost someone, this novel will resonate with you for a very long time."
2,"A commentary, not source material","If you're looking for the TEXT written by Cotton Mather -- This is NOT it!! It is a commentary on Mather!...It's difficult to find a copy of Magnalia Christi Americana. This may be helpful for those who want to hear someone else's analysis of history.For those of us who want to make our own analysis, look elsewhere."
2,More like Edge UN-lock,"I've used this with mixed results in the past, but tonight's job left me so frustrated with this tape, that I had to leave a review. For being called EDGE LOCK, it sure does unstick easily! Easy removal is an understatement, as this tape was lifting off the trimwork that I was painting above just from the pressure of a paintbrush. This did, of course, cause bleeding through. It didn't come unstuck from the ceiling, but did peel little flakes of paint and drywall from it when removing. Since I'd had problems with it in the past, I used standard ScotchBlue 2090 on one side, and 2080EL on the other side. The regular 2090 is HALF the price of this product, and works BETTER! I'll post a picture on the product site of the comparison. I don't predict this product staying on the market very long."
5,"A heartwarming story for girls of all ages, at all times.","""Anne of Green Gables"" is a classic every girl should read, no matter how old she is. The reader travels with Anne and delights in the poetry of everyday life seen by the eyes of a little orphan girl who doesn't cease to appreciate nature and whose wonderful imagination can turn a dull day into an adventure. This beautiful boxed set makes the perfect gift for either those who enjoyed the first book and would like to know what happened to Anne, or those who are reading the story for the first time."
5,"Fun, entertaining, classic.",I picked up these books as a kid and loved them. I still love them as an adult. I bought the books for nostalgia. I like the covers and colors. My only complaint is that the box is a little flimsy.
3,ok,I bought this for my preteen daughter who loved little house on the prairie but did not like as much
1,TO BORING!!!,"I have no Idea why anyone would actually spend money on thisbook.Buy it as a doorstop, or maybe use it as a coaster orsomething,but whatever you do,DON'T READ IT!!!This is one of the most boring books I have ever read.It is nothing but a bunch of fantasies that stupid people have.Goodbye"
4,Awesome read,I am reading these with my 7yr old and 4 yr old girls and they love the girly stories and wonderful adventures they tell. Warm fuzzy reading.
2,impractical.,"you get wet if it rains, if you move you dump over in it. It is Timely to set up. the mosquitos some how still get in. takes up the same pack space as a tent. Just use a tent."
2,Ropes NOT included,"Unlike what is stated on this products description, the rope to tie to a tree is NOT included."
1,didn't even get to use it.,"This is a poor product with a bad design and cheap materials. i hung this up in the backyard to test it out before a camping trip and all the stitches in the canvas bottom ripped out the first time i sat in it. I may not be the lightest person to try this hammock, but at 225 pounds i am nowhere near the weigh limit."
4,Centric Cermaic Pads (105 posi-quiet),"I purchased and installed these front pads on my '99 Corolla.After bedding them in with 5-6 gradual stops from 30-35 mph,I am very pleased with their braking performance inboth wet and dry conditions. Initial bite is very adequateand progressive.After 600+ miles, no squeals or chirps so far.For an everyday commuter car either on the highway or in townthese pads exceed my expectations. As far as longevity, that I cannotcomment on yet. I am an easy to moderate braker, so I expect long lifefrom these pads. I am hoping to get at least 50k or more out of them.I typically can get 70k from most pads. So it should not be a problem.For $32, these are a tremendous value that offer very good brakingperformance. I would certainly buy these pads again."
4,Excellent historical summary of the varsity VFs ...,"If you are interested in the history of the USN's carrier performance during WW2, this is an essential contribution evaluating and analyzing the surprisingly successful results the technologically inferior USN fighter squadrons experienced during the crucial first months of the pacific war. It would be hard to find a more thorough history of the men and the machines involved in the first innings of this conflict, and the innovative tactics the USN junior VF officers developed to counter their opponents. As a former, undistinguished LCDR from the medical corps, my hat is off to those true Navy heros who changed the balance of power in the Pacific during the US's great time of need.A must read if you ever dreamed of pulling off a high-side attack against a Kate threatening your own carrier..."
3,Need Better Description,"Product description could have been better since this product is ""B"" size and will not completely cover steering wheels with a 4 inch circumference. This company makes a ""C"" size and that is what most people need these days if they have a newer car. Other than that, I can still use it. The cover gives you a better and more comfortable grip on the wheel with no excessive friction. Installation was simple. Just be sure not to twist the lace as you go along."
5,Delightful little book,"The autobiographical musings of a New Yorker cartoonist told to his old friend, and filled with wit, humanity and philosophical gems. Stories of escaping from the fascist police in Italy, too lazy to brutally arrest people at the usual invisible ungodly hour. Or civic life in 1950s Washington, and the charming people who knew exactly how to be courteous and to dismiss those who didn't belong. Or the poor white in kentucky, like protagonists out of American fiction, whereas the bourgeoisie, respectable people, ""always the same"". And Magritte's discovery of multiple sources of light in a painting (sun, streetlamp, electric light inside a house, the moon, reflections of light. Or American gastronomy, in which ""the taste of the nation are governed by the tastes of children""."
2,Not as pictured.,"The color wasn't the same. It looks like cheap pleather, even toned and dark, dark brown--not the stylish worn look, as pictured. Also, it has written ""PASSPORT"" written on it. Basically, the picture is NOT what you get and also apparently ""NO LOGO"" means no USA symbol, just writing."
4,A volume every theology scholar needs.,"This is an excellent translation of some of the pseudepigraphal writings that didn't quite make it into the modern day canon of scripture. The translations are very well footnoted with alternative explanations or examples from other manuscripts so that the full meanings are not lost. This book is large, so make sure that the binding and the pages are fully attached; mine arrived somewhat detached and for that the book will creak and probably cause some problems later on. I discovered the problem with the book after the full return period had expired. This book also complements volume II very well. With both volumes, the reader should have the majority of the pseudepigrapha for research/enjoyment. See also ""The Other Bible"" by Willis Barnstone for further abridgement of Gnostic, Kabbalistic, and pseudepigraphal works."
1,What a bore,This book was not rousing as stated in the Booklist review. It put me to sleep on more than one occassion. What an unsatisfying ending to a pretty good trilogy.
1,Yet Another Poorly-Written Diatribe Using A Stereotypical Treatment of Christianity,"A lot of other people treated the Wiccan side of this book, and so I will comment briefly on her treatment of Christianity.Time and again, Neo-Pagans will take a singular, limited, stereotypical, fundamentalist, or medieval example of Christian belief and present it as ""The Christianity."" This book is sadly no different. When will there be a neo-pagan apologetics against Christianity that actually treats the intricate fabric of Christian theology and not take a singular, simplistic example of it and say, ""This is Christianity. See how terrible it is?""I grow weary of the lack of education amongst Neo-Pagans in this area."
4,The people of Peace Rejoice,"I participated in the Seeds of Peace camp this past summer. Even though the book used examples from more early years, I could relate my experiences to the amazing process described in the book, the unmasking of the enemy, and the establishment of friendships amongst foresworn enemys. But this book wouldn't appeal only to those who have gone through the program, it will show those who aren't fimiliar with it, and even those who do not know much about the middle east, the work being done to resolve this conflict, and the emphasis that even though the participants are young in age, they can and will shape the society, and the future of the middle-east to a better place for all religions and nationalities."
5,"Too Good to Leave, Too Bad to Stay","Excellent, direct, and full of case studies. Very helpful advice as it relates to each scenario and example of relationships and their foundations from which they are built. Just when you were asking yourself, ""What does she mean by this?"" the author would write, ""and for those of you who are wondering what I mean by this...."" and she would give a complete explanation to help the reader apply it to themselves. Her no-nonsense approach accomplished precisely the reader's goal of answering that ""stay or go"" question. She keeps the reader from waffling around getting at the real meat of the question by sticking to her pointed questions that we are assigned to ponder and answer truthfully. Truly helpful for that next step, after your friends' advice and counsel start to fall on deaf ears and fail to move you into action, one way or the other."
2,correlation from reading the comments,"I have not read the book but read through the comments. It seems to me that MOST of the ones giving HIGH stars to the book are people that left their relationship and seem to have wanted to leave the relationship prior to reading the book. While, the ones giving LOW stars are those that stayed and wanted to stay prior to reading the book. Just going by that I would say, not a very good book if you are TRULY open to either staying or leaving, only if you are leaning toward leaving."
2,"Not very inspirational, but it made some valid points...","If I followed the advice in this book, I'd be divorced, homosexual, athiest, and generally no one I'd want to be around. (I'm almost divorced anyway, because my wife read the book, too!) Still, it points out some valid statements that, while I don't believe they're necessarily good enough reasons to leave a relationship without trying (especially when young children are involved) they do bring up the darker side of human nature, like the inability to forgive. The Bible is a much better resource!"
1,Not a book for people looking for solutions,This book simlifies marital problems too much - and it seems the author is more in favor of marraiges ending then staying together. I think this book should come with a warning label - buyer beware!
5,Book from Free State Books,"I only paid a 1 cent for the book and it was in great shape! Trustworthy, dependable, and I'm thankful."
4,Good and crisp,"Crisp ,no nonsense writing .it shows one exactly what is needed,whether to leave or stay and repair and when and how much time needed to give for solutions.the example are accurate .all in all a good book to clear confusions and web"
4,Beautiful Holiday Music,"This Cd is a worthy addition to any holiday music collection. The selections are well recorded and a joy to play while reading, decorating the tree, putting up decorations around the house, baking cookies, eating dinner - any holiday endeavor. There are two Cds in the pack. Both offer a wonderful selection of holiday music - some familiar and some that aren't so familiar. This makes for a unique listening experience.The price is right for 2 Cds - 2 hours of music to enjoy this year and every year after. I give this CD set my recommendation for purchase.Happy Holidays!"
2,a very bad valvule,valve leaks air and within hours the float is deflated. I need to use a pair of pliers to close the valve and keep the air a couple of days
5,It was really cheap,It's good to find health care supplements at a low price and especially when you need it the most. This item covered my expectations on a high level. I was looking for it for a long time and finally I got it at Amazon.com. In Amazon you can find whatever you're looking for.Thanks Amazon for this opportunity.
1,BAD PRODUCT!,"This product killed my USB ports, and before I knew what was going on, it killed 2 SATA disk drives. There is NO manufacture contact info in the brochure and there is NO product warranty of any kind mentioned in the brochure. BUY AND USE AT YOUR OWN RISK! I'd give this product -10 stars if I could!"
5,excellent product! so easy to use!,"just bought this device to get the files off my girlfriends lap top that stop working a few months ago. it was so easy to use, its just like plugging in a thumb drive. plugged it into the wall, connected the hard drive from the laptop and hit the power switch, thats it! nothing hard about it. then its just like browsing the files from the C drive of the other computer. there is no programs to install just plug it in and go! this device probably saved us some big time money, then if we had gone to a computer store to have them get the files off of it.this could not be simpler, if you are still wondering about weather or not this is a legit product, stop thinking and buy it! just ignore all the 1 star reviews these people clearly have no idea what they are doing/talking about. im not even a computer guy and this was simple to use. 100% best buy and awesome product!"
4,"Works great so far, b","In keeping up with other manufacturers, CoolMax decided to cut costs by NOT including a manual, drivers, or the ""One Touch Backup"" software advertised on the box. Instead, they direct you to the following site for said materials:[...]The thing is, the links for CD-350-Combo downloads are broken. In fact, all links are broken. This means no manual, no drivers (for win98 users) and no One touch Backup software.Fortunately, it works fine on XP and Vista, and has (so far) not caused any harm to any of my computers or drives. Note: like other USB devices with USB power Y adapters, do NOT use the red plug while using the supplies power supply. One or the other. Red plug is ONLY for powering a 2.5"" PATA laptop drive without need for the large power supply."
3,Out of date,"The book was decent and informative but out of date.It does give you a good idea about using the internet and setting up a web site to help sell your photos in the marketplace.It was published in 2000. It refers to using windows 95 & 98 and modems with 2800 baud. It is out of date, he needs to update the book.I paid a discount price of 13.99 for it but it should be selling for less.I read his other book ""How to sell and resell your photos"" which was a very good book for photographers thinking of going into stock photography.It would be nice to see an update with the newer XP operating system and newer software programs and web sites listed."
2,Disappointed,I was disappointed at the little information provided in this pamphlet for the price. It took me 10-15 minutes to read and did not tell me anything that I didn't know before. The pamphlet did not give any sample prayers for the reader to participate in. It really was a waste of money!
4,3 hours would be nice...,I got this battery to supplement the 1 hour battery that came with my jvc camera. At the very most I get 140 minutes which is better than the 60 minutes I get with the default battery.
5,Chipmunk Easter movie,Grand daughter loved this Chipmunk movie.A chipmunk as the Easter Bunny and he was the FIRST Easter bunny...how can this be??? Cute movie.
5,A pantry staple,"I keep quite a few types of hot sauce around so I can tailor the flavors to whatever I'm making. This is my favorite for wings. The lime gives the sauce a nice tang, and it's not too hot for most folks. I serve the wings with a bottle of regular Frank's and some crushed red peppers so real heat freaks can spike them up a little."
1,a bad book,just looking that the preview that's available i can already tell that this is a bad book. some of the drawings look like kindergarten drawings or chicken scratch. stay away from this book.
3,Fashion Book,It is interesting and well written. It guides through but not as deeply as I was expected.
4,Not so much about drawing...,"But about how to draw inspiration from common everyday things. It`s really not about rendering or drawing fashion, but more about the thought process in making the garments."
5,Some great songs here!,"Every song on here is really good! I took half a star away for some of the production value. It sounds like a few songs needed a little more of a tweak in the studio (Second Chance, It Must Suck To Be You, Welcome), but they are good songs.Then there's the ones that are just perfect (Back In My Arms, Revealed, Game Of Life, All I Said, I Just Wanna Be Loved) that show how versatile this band was. Four lead vocalists / songwriters and a nice blend of styles."
2,Not worth the time,Poorly written rehash of better work by others--too much space dedicated to author's many phobias
3,Seve,"Film was obviously rushed out after his passing and a liitle more thought, quality of filming and effects would have enhanced the production more fitting the great man he was !!I am sure an improved version will be distributed in the future."
1,"On-off switch does not stay ""on""","I see other people have complained about this. At first it worked sporadically; now I have to stand next to the kettle, holding the switch in the ""on"" position, to get it to heat up. Pain in the neck. Avoid."
3,It's a love-hate thing,"I love the shape and balance of this kettle. Pouring the water is very easy, smooth and controlled.Now for the downside:1) Mine leaks all the time unless I allow it to get scaled up. The base will be sitting in a big puddle of water. If I ever de-scale it, it will leak again. If I don't descale, it stops leaking.2) The lid is made of a plastic that becomes VERY brittle and weak from the constant heat exposure. I've replaced the lid twice now, and it's hopeless. It will break apart on you as if it was made of eggshell. I ended up just gluing mine in place and I never open it. I just pour the water in through the pour spout without ""opening"" it.Despite the serious problems with this unit, I still like it and now that mine has irreparably broken, I'm going to replace it with another of these units."
4,The electric kettle that could,"I got this water kettle for Christmas, and I love it.It fits perfectly into my somewhat modern kitchen, with its color and its design, truly unique!As impressed as I was with its look, its functionality surpassed even that.The light tells you when it's on, you can leave the base plugged in because you remove the kettle, it pours well.Should you forget you were boiling water, it turns itself off, so no harm, no foul.I know it's ridiculous to love a kitchen appliance, but this kettle is different :)"
5,fun,The leather wore off on my wife's Miata and we are both Disney fans so I bought this for her. Perfect fit and she loves it.
2,My Flag,"Received my Flag today, the stars are painted on Not Sewn on!! now I have to return it this is not what I wanted."
4,Easy scanner with great software,"I run XP and had no trouble whatsoever installing and using the scanner software.The adobe photoshop elements that comes with this scanner is worth the price alone.There is one glitch however, I have a USB Canon printer and neither will work if both are connected to the computer. I think this may be because the printer is the USB 1.1 and the scanner is 2.0 but I'm not sure."
3,Amusing,"City couple move to the country. The husband intends to be a novelist. The wife reluctantly goes along with the move. Largely it's a typical comic adversity story but with some of the mishaps a little more outrageous than ""The Egg and I."" It doesn't really start to rise (to my warped perspective) above say ""Green Acres"" until the husband starts going through some changes. For example he tries to improve his mail delivery service by attempting to murder the mailman in the belief that any replacement would have to be an improvement. In summary, I didn't find it hysterical or hilarious. I found it amusing. Amusing enough that I expect to read another Jay Cronley book in the not too distant future."
1,"Who really is the ""well spouse""?","It is evident that writing this book was probably quite cathartic for M.D. Cohen. It is a vivid portrait of narcissism and self-absorption of a rather high degree. Pity for Ms. Cohen's negativity and aspirations to martyrdom emerge early in the reading of this book. It is also difficult to imagine how Mr. Cohen was able to endure the rampant emotional DIS-ability of his alleged ""well spouse"". I was gratified to learn that he was finally released from her ""care"" and concomitant anger and negativity. If anything, this book shows who the ""well spouse"" REALLY is. And the author is NOT the well-spouse. Not in the least. I wish Mr. Cohen and his children well. And perhaps, by now, M.D. Cohen has been healed of her emotional illness. One can hope.An LCSW in Virginia"
2,A new novel from a master storyteller doesn't measure up,This long-awaited sequel to Curse of Chalion just doesn't measure up to Bujold's usual well-crafted prose. The story was interesting but it just didn't flash with her unique voice. A disappointment.
5,I need 2 copies...one to keep and one to give away,"I have been avidly following this author since Warrior's Apprentice. I buy all of her books hardback, as soon as they come out. Having said that-this is my favorite book to date.I can painfully identify with the main character, Ista. She has been through a lot with no one to rely on buy herself. She has pulled herself through and SURVIVED. She is now doing more than surviving, she is finding her happiness. There are so many climactic scenes in this book it doesn't get dull for a moment. There is also a (non-steamy) romance. Happily, this isn't the romance of a young couple who has seen no pain. Instead it is the romance of an older couple.Not only would I recommend this book for the normal sci-fi/fantasy crowd...I would recommend it for any one (especially any woman) who is (or has) gone through the pain of losing themselves."
4,A fully fleshed out female protagonist,"I haven't read The Curse of Chalion, so I am not comparing this book to its predecessor. I liked Ista, I liked the plot turns and twists, I liked how Bujold had yet *more* plot going on long after a lesser writer would have ended the story (after the mystery of the two men is solved).The story is not without its flaws. There is some dialogue that doesn't quite fit, and I did get annoyed a bit with the change of pace from a fantasy to a mystery novel in the middle (aka Murder She Wrote). It's not perfect by any means, but any book with such a well-thought out mileau and characters gets a standing ovation from me."
2,A Very Poor Follow Up,I loved the Curse of Chalion but this was a very disappointing sequel. It was very slow and lacked the soul of the first book. I had hoped for so much more from Bujold.
4,A Bird in its Nest,"Start with a widowed dowager, a middle-aged princess in high royal court who is gifted by the gods to see the demon light.Next, put her on a pilgrimage with a female courier, a lady-in-waiting, a priest and two royal guards.She is ambushed and then saved by a knight in blood speckled armor. A dead knight, kept alive by his loving wife with demon magic.Mix in a handsome brother, an evil sorceress and you got yourself a pretty good story. And a 2004 Hugo Award winning novel by Lois McMaster Bujold.I think this was really my first true fantasy book. I purposely picked out a female author in an attempt to break free from my male dominated sci-fi writers.The female author described the male genitals as a ""bird in its nest."""
4,Read both Atreus & Fifth Day- excellent!,"I boughtThe Mask of Atreusas well asOn the Fifth Dayat the same time and read them back-to-back. Yes, I am partial to science-based mysteries in general. Add to that the historical and religious element and I am hooked. A. J. Hartley's characters are well-developed and one sees more human fallibility in them than heroism. While some believe that Hartley's aim is to do a spot of Catholic-bashing, my opinion is slightly different... honestly you need to judge this for yourself. I like the fact that this author does not seem to have a ""position"". There is no wrong or right and all arguments are presented and positions are represented as ""shades of grey"" rather than black or white... I observed a similar style in only one other book,The Rozabal Linewhich took pro and con positions on the same issue. Overall, a great read."
5,mystery and history,The Mask Of Atreus mixes a Dan Brown style unrelenting pace and intrigue with wolrd travel with deep histoircal background.The book is well researched without being over boring in the level of historical detail and reflects the authors passion for the both the art of writing as well as the subject matter.The intrigue is plentiful and keeps you guessing and you'll not want to put it down!The characters are credible and original!Enjoy.
2,Disappointing. . .,"I love food books and history books and was perhaps expecting a more thorough discussion of the history of food and it's migration from region to region. At best, the discussions were cursory and hardly as comprehensive as one would expect in a book labeled as an atlas. Significant information was missing about foods that weren't of interest to the authors and information about other foods important enough in historical economic impact to require their entry still left out detail I know from other, better sources.At best, this book serves adequately, perhaps even well, as an introduction to it's subject, but it is little better than that. IMO, for cover price, it's not worth it. For $..., it certainly is worth the content. Amazon's price comes close, but not close enough for me to give this as a gift (unless I give my own copy)."
5,An order from OZ,"I am so happy with this light !!! It arrived whole , well packed , was easy to install and looks fantastic over my kitchen island .Shipping was very quick , 7 days. Thanks to all who made this happen ."
5,Great study centered upon the Person of Christ!,"Addresses a multiplicity of aspects concerning Christology. This book is a benchmark to the study of the Person of Christ including historical research, OT appearances of Christ further substantiated by NT usage, and so much more. An excellent buy!"
4,Helpful Tool to go with your maps,"This chip for Spain allowed us to travel with a lot less stress. Note however--that there are new Autopistas and so sometimes you'll have to check the map and know you're going the right direction. This is usually simple to figure out--but note that things change so you can rely on this about 95% so know bascially where you are going. Also---in the city (Bilbao) there is a bit of a delay so that does cause some confusion since there are many 1 way streets, etc. Overall, I was extremely happy having this micro card and it made driving in the North of Spain quite easy."
1,Save your money!!! Vitually useless in Spain.,"I just returned from 7 weeks in Spain. Spent most of the time in Madrid, but traveled extensively by car throughout Andalucia. In most places, it takes the Nuvi 15-45 minutes to find a satellite. Yes, 45 minutes. In Madrid, the signal is lost continually. In traveling by car, the program cannot distinguish between toll and non-toll roads, and is totally confused by those that run parallel to each other. In small towns and cities, with multiple rendondas and one-way streets, the program will have you going in circles and crazy. And bear in mind that turning around in Spain is not like it is in the US. Miss a turn, for example in Arcos de la Frontera in the area of the Parador, and you will be obliged to circumvent the entire city, a good 15-20 minutes. The program is an absolute waste of money and time. Don't say that you weren't warned!!"
1,Who would want this on standard-def DVD?,"No Blu-ray release = no sale. Such a shame, too, because I adored the first season of WEB THERAPY. With all the little details on the computer screen throughout the series, it makes no sense not to have a clear high-def version of each episode. Showtime is really shooting themselves in the foot by not putting out the optimal format most people use in the year 2012."
2,Oh-k movie,Not enough magic for my imagination as it portrayed. The story is actually short as well.
4,"Whimsical movie for the kids, deeper meanings for adults",This was an interesting movie. The main character has a whimsy that reminded me of Robin Williams in Toys. Dustin Hoffman was absolutely brilliant. The kids enjoyed the whimsy of the living toy store. I enjoyed the deeper exploration of death and letting go. It was both fun and touching.
1,WORST BLU RAY EVER,It's not the movie that's horrible (it's great) but $30 for a blu-ray with ZERO special features? Save you money and get the much more engrossing widescreen dvd release. How do they expect people to pay top dollar for blu-ray and not include any special features whatsoever? It's robbery.
2,did I miss something?,"A magical toystore. Fantasy land for children.I usually love such films, but this one, for some unknown reason, just didn't do it for me. The two actors I usually enjoy watching, Hoffman & Portman, I felt were overacting, and I actually disliked Portman's character right from the start; Hoffman's character was obnoxious; and Bateman was, simply put, idiotic and clichéd.The only thing that saves the movie are the toys.I must have missed something that makes the movie so great. Everyone else seems to have enjoyed it. I found it boring even after 20 minutes of watching, and found myself longing for the movie to end."
1,FIVE STARS? ARE YOU KIDDING ME?,"I was so disappointed in this movie. I really wanted to like it. It felt so contrived (especially during the bubble wrap part), fake and disconnected. And the ending was so sudden. I thought it should have gone on longer/ended differently. I'm giving it one star as it was a huge waste of time."
3,Interesting take on an appalling scandal,"Goodwin covers the Salt Lake figure skating debacle with style, if not altogether truth - the Russian pair gave a superb performance that on any other night would have been worthy of Olympic gold (and still might have in an uncorrupted panel, since it's a subjective sport). Bad judging, however, is nothing new; it takes place at all levels from the recreational ISI to the Olympics. Recommend for those who are interested in the scandal - otherwise, there's really nothing new that skaters and people who closely follow the sport don't already know."
4,Buffalo Bill,"its a well done movie, good entertainment,Joel McCrea's a good actor, and I can't think of him doing a bad movie"
4,worth the money,"I like Joel McCrea and I like westerns.Buffalo Bill was an good western for me.It had some great moments and it had some weak moments.Acting,story,locations,and cast were alright.Actually a great cast.Movie is in color and the transfer is 4.5 out of 5.... support your favorite artists."
5,Snakes-my mom had to watch this one too.,"Loved learning about the new critters. And it looked good on TV, very informative and be aware of your surroundings."
3,harmony,"This book is informative. However, I have read many very similar books, so there really was no need to finish reading it."
2,Poorly designed belt for putting on heating pad.,"Putting on the Bed Buddy is a challenge. The velcro 'buckle' attaches behind your back and it's very difficult to pull the belt tight and attach it with only two hands. Also, the belt is a narrow elastic strap that deforms to become even narrower after using it a few times. Because of the narrow belt, the pad tends not to stay in place. The heating pad works fine, it's just a pain to put in on."
3,Didn't retain heat for long,"I had an older version of this product that retained heat for over an hour at a time. This recently purchased, new version doesn't retain heat nearly as long as the older one did. I have to keep reheating it."
1,"Beware, heat seekers!","I have been using 'rice bags' for over ten years, to soothe muscle tension. I was very happy to receive this one as a Christmas gift, I like the wrap-around and Velcro features.Uunfortunately, it's been 3 weeks and this product has already met its demise in the microwave. The 2 minute time limit is far from adequate, even in my powerful microwave. I carefully bumped up the time until I found that 3 minutes did the trick, and this worked fine for a week, until it caught fire yesterday in my kitchen! Instructions say to lay it flat in the microwave - unless you have an enormous oven I'd say that's impossible. Apparently mine got a hot spot and that was that. I've had rice bags that lasted years upon years. Oh well, at least it didn't cause a house fire! Unless you've the patience of a nun and can increase heat in 15 second intervals like the tag says, I'd look elsewhere."
3,Not The Same...,"Years ago (like 4) they were better made.Poor stitching nowadays, but if you are lucky, it wont fall apart at the seams and will give you hours of comfort and warmth on those cold nights when the bed feels chilly. 3.5 minutes in my microwave seems to do the trick.I use it as a bed-warmer and occasional muscle-ache relief and have always been satisfied. Just be aware that if you can't sew, or catch it after it breaks, you have to probably get another one.One other drawback is always having to reposition the grains so they fill the pockets evenly and are well-distributed throughout."
4,Comfortable,"Nice, heavy comfortable wrap. I do wish the neck part was higher, but you can push the wrap up more on your neck. I have only tried this with heat. It holds the heat pretty well. If I try this with cold, I will comment more later :)"
4,backwrap,"have to be careful with it. it can get too hot when you heat it in mircowave, otherwise it works good."
5,It's SO Big!,"The ""Carex Bed Buddy Body Wrap"" is just what I needed to sooth my sholder AND back. It's just the right size to get the job done! The Best!!!"
1,this thing stank,"The bed buddy smells so bad. If you want your house to smell like burnt popcorn and death, go ahead, buy it."
3,Nice but needs a better type of closure for a better fit.,"This does well for a heating pad, but the lack of a ring closure to pull the elastic band thru to overlap it to bring it back across the body to ensure a secure fit and keep the pad from sliding out of position. I needed it for pain in the small of my lower back and, as is, the Velcro closure has to be well past the middle of the length of the pad. Therefore, if I move at all with it on, it slips out of place and the part that is overlapped by the elastic band slips too low to do any good and makes it uncomfortable. I checked with a local alteration place & was told it would cost $15 to add the ring closure or a single double OO closure to fix the problem. I wish it were constructed better."
3,Not hot enough,The product does not get hot enough for me. It is a good idea but needs to be thicker to retain the heat better like the original bed buddy.
1,Carex Bed Buddy wraps,"What a disappointment!!! Had several of the bean bag warmers for years..heat & use. Great!Thought I'd order the newest Bed Buddy wraps for my hubby. Ordered the foot warmers, hand warmers, back, body and ""bean bag"" warmer...All I can say is ""YUCK""!!!They smell horrible..made in China and full of some horrible herbal stuff!Contacted the company and they said, ""No refunds""!!"
1,disappointed,thought straps would he a little wider since ia m a senoir citizen with arthritis it is hard tp reach bak to grab staps to put in lower back gave it away
4,"...Could be consider HEROES worthy,If given chance !","THE RAPTUREwww.rapturethemovie.comA Johnny K Wu `Live Anime'Bio-engineered angel and Scorpion-based character takes us on a fascinating adventure.Great CGI and martial arts lend themselves to a anime-flushed tale of intrigue and betrayal.We always pick on the covers, Betraying our sales background, `Rapture' comes with a cover reminding one of Frank Miller's SIN CITY. It's artsy-fartsy look is impressive and vague...Go MATRIX or go B-Movie graphics,But please don't scare your core audience away ( Back cover is more what we want).This movie is an obvious labor of love, That delivers to viewer not aware of the bells & whistles involved.Cast was more than adequate, Many of the males have `That Caesar ` haircut that's belies a Biblical nuance.Entertaining movie, Extras include making-of featurettes that explain the effects for laypeople, Oh ! that soundtrack."
4,good plugs,"Well, to start things off. Their consistency is comparable to a gummy bear. Pretty snug fit compared to other designs I've used. But if you want dbs down to a minimum, I'd still suggest the Ear-Muff design.(If you were willing to throw more money towards that kind of investment) This price is very good for the plug's quality, nontheless."
5,"Very comfortable, and the price can't be beat","I picked up a pair of these earplugs because the price was very low, and I needed something to use when clay shooting that wouldn't risk scratching my shotgun.They are very comfortable, work quite well for reducing noise, and are inexpensive.I will be stocking up on them to use for all my shooting events."
4,Loved book,Cat loverread twice and gave to friends to read they loved it as wellreceived fast ... because the anticipation to read it and after was well worth the wait
1,Misleading Info,Mistaken info in the product ad led to my purchase / return of this part. Hassle but the return/refund policy seemed to work ok.
3,Clueless,"Wish I knew how to attach this lens. I am a novice, only ever owned just simple point and shoots can anyone help so I can use lens?"
5,Awesome vocals,"Milira is one of those rare artists who truly sings from deep within. You can hear the sincere passion she has for her craft in her songs.You can also hear the gospel roots in her voice. This album is deffinately one to own in your not too old, but goodie collection.I enjoyed this album thouroughly when I first heard in the early 90's and still do. I give it a thumbs up and five stars.Milira is awesome!"
5,Great new programming paradigm.,"I am currently working as a computer hardware design engineer. I have always been looking for new software methodology to improve my hardware design flow. Prolog, and especially its presentation in this book, shows me an interesting and powerful view of how computer programming should be.Overall, I am a true believer in Prolog and logic programming after reading this book."
1,Don't support this author. This guy is probably a know it all weenie who despises anyone who can out wit him!,"and yes, i bought the book and thumbed through it reading a few pages. U would be better attainingthe language and logic skills of the people he despises in my humble opinion than to read this junk... B. O. R. I. N. G.!"
3,Good Read straight to the point,"This Book is a very nice read. Very simply put, and good references but, quite short. I enjoyed it as I have read many books on the subjects of personality disorders.There are points that help in dealing with a person that is ""off"" and different opinions of the author very well put but not ellaboate.There are references to the book by Cleckley ""the mask of sanity"" which is a good book to read however the mask is a very indepth view written by a Doctor that is very hard to read and takes some time to digest although the information is good.Overall I would say this book is worth reading but you can finish it in one sitting...."
1,Wasted money on this one,"I learned a few new terms, such as ""covert aggressive"" but I still don't really know how I'm supposed to handle people like this. The book was disappointing, contained case studies and specific suggestions for handling the people in the case studies, but I did not find it valuable or informative."
2,Overpriced Basics,This software is incredibly overpriced for the material and does NOT have real world scenarios the way interaction in a classroom does. If you pay this much you might as well take a live classroom language b/c you will not learn language from this software!
4,Good hot spot finder,"I have been looking for a WiFi finder for a little while. I did not want to have a big bulky one. Keep this one handy, attached to my computer pack back to easy accessibility . I have read other reviews about this so finally decided to get it. It beats lugging out the computer to find if you have a good signal. Now this does not tell you if the signal in secured or not. It will tell you if you have a good strength though."
1,Stay Far Far Away!!!,"Worthless... very mixed results, basically has not wroked at all and this is in a suburban small town with one signal around."
2,Great song on a crap album,"The rating is for the entire album. I almost gave it one star, but ""Crazy"" is the catchiest thing I've heard in over a year & deserves much better supporting material than the junk on here. I'm so disappointed...I really wanted to find some hidden gem, but after having it play constantly in my car for the last week, nothing as yet has jumped out of my speakers.It's called inspiration flowed for three minutes & needed some filler to justify a cd length release. A lot of the lyrics for other songs are creepy (but not in any cathartic good way.) And the beats (sans Crazy)are pretty lame too. I borrowed my roommates copy & sure am glad I didn't spend my own 10 bucks.Not many people are able to make an album that's consistently good beginning to end. Who knows why the muse can depart just as quickly as it arrives?"
1,fakeout,"Reviews in magazines said that this was great CD; that all the songs were great. I had only heard the song ""Crazy"" and I really liked it. So, I thought I'd trust the reviews and try it out. It turns out that ""Crazy"" is the only song on there that I like. The rest was just bizarre, especially the first track; none of it was anything like their hit song.. The only advice I can give, seen as everyone has different taste, is to make sure you hear more of the CD before you bother buying it."
2,Not crazy about it.,Might just be me--but this is one of those CD's that the song they play on the radio is the only decent one. Maybe I'm too old for the rest--but wish I had kept the crystal so I could sell it on Ebay.
5,St Elsewhere....,".....is da bomb! The title track is my fave, and my daughter loves ""Boogie Monster."" Both Cee Lo and Danger Mouse have done a terrific job; Danger Mouse with the lyrics and Cee Lo has an impressive range, right from the get-go with ""Go-go gadget Gospel."" Overall an excellent CD to add to your collection."
4,It grew on me!,"Okay like many people, I became obsessed with ""Crazy"" with it's excellent baseline and memorable lyrics. After a while I gave it a break and considered most of the cd a bit eclectic for typical radio stations. However, I enjoy the live performances and creativity. Even if this project is short lived, wasn't it worthwhile to hear C-Lo SANG and Danger Mouse create memorable mixes.... I love ""The Last Time""."
5,Gnarles in charge,"With St. Elsewhere, the duo of vocalist Ce-lo and producer of the moment Danger Mouse have produced a left field hit that defies category. The current hit CRAZY may be the best song on the album, but several others come close including the manic TRANSFORMER, JUST A THOUGHT, FEN SUI, GO-GO GADGET GOSPEL and STORM WARNING. The duo shows their eclectic side well, especially on the cover of the Violent Femmes chestnut GONE DADDY GONE. The weakest cuts are merely good and the CD as a whole invites one to hit the replay button over and over. Call it dance music, rap, pop or what have you, Gnarles Barkley have delivered one of the more enjoyable CD's to come along in ages."
4,An enjoyable album,"Like other reviewers, I bought this mainly for ""Crazy"". I also agree that this album is not for everyone. Don't expect every song to be fun and bouncy - ""Just a Thought"" is about suicide, and ""Necromancing"" is about necrophilia. I think that these songs don't really fit in with the rest of the album, and that's why I give St. Elsewhere four stars. Yes, the album is short, but I would rather have it be short than have a longer album where I don't like half of the songs. I like 12 of the 14 songs on this album, and I consider that to be better than most albums out there."
2,Over-rated,"A couple half-way interesting tracks, but mostly over-rated. Don't waste your money without sampling it before hand."
1,"All hype, no substance","I turned on Conan one night to see a band starting a song. They were dressed in towels and bathrobes, as if to show they're quirky and fun, but they played with all the enthusiasm of a chain gang picking up trash on the side of the road. As someone who plays both bass and drums I found the rhythm section painfully stiff. The bass the line plodded along just behind the beat and the bass drum sounded like someone whacking a rug with a broom. Just awful. The lyrics sounded like a work in progress. Can't think of a phrase? Just repeat one over and over! ""I remember..."" ""Who do you..."" When Conan came out to thank them I was sure I heard the band name wrong.I'm mystified when I discover that this is the trendy new band. Music aside, they should be banned from the airwaves forever for having the stupidest band name of all time. But the music, once you get through the hype, just plain sucks."
4,pretty good cd,"a little short on time (only about 40 minutes), but that's a good thing since they cut through all the bulls**t (no skits, intros, outros, etc.) and just give you straight music. can't wait to hear more of them in the future.G."
4,Listen again...,"I wasn't feelin this album on my first couple of listens, but suddenly I found my self listening to it back, to back, to back. There's still about 2 tracks that are just...ok. But overall I'm glad I made the purchase."
2,No memorable quote available.,"Half-hearted adaptation of Ernest Haycox novel is weak. Scott is good as Owen; Knox is equally good as the baddie, but the film is missing movement. If there were ever a Razzie award at the time, it would have to go to the title song."
2,Incorrect Product Description,Item say's it has 3 6FT pole... but after opening I could see only 2.. not sure if I made any mistakes or not..could you pls let me know.
3,Just pulled down my ballast,"I had two bulbs out and they were two stories up in my house. One bulb went in nice and easy. I pulled the suction cup downwards and suction was broken and bulb was installed.The next bulb went in easily too....until I tried to pull the auction cup free. It pulled down the ballast and was still stuck. I created a knife on a long pole to slip between the bulb an the suction cup to break it free. It worked but now I have a dangling high hat bulb two stories up,over the stairs."
4,Great Sound Great Deal,"Pros:All 7 amps sound great, Digital Dolby sounds great, Many different surround modes, HD over component and video format conversionCons:Always have to flip over double sided remote - Not a good layout, No HDMI inputs.Summary:This is a great quality receiver for a bargain price. I am only using it for the audio inputs, so I can't speak for the video performance. It has 2 coax and 2 fiber digital inputs which work great. I don't think I will use analog inputs again if I can avoid it."
2,Not What I hoped,"Product arrived quickly and as advertised. No problem there, but the CPL filter is a majordisappointment. It fuzzes all images, regardless of the lens I use it with. Not what I had hoped for."
4,awesome filters,These filters work great and I use them often! Haven't had any issues to date and would definitely recommend to others looking to purchase similar items.
5,Wonderful and fullfilling ... a gift from a Higher Power,"Thanks Joan, for this gift to all of us. Thanks for having the courage to write it. My life has changed. I view this book as a direct message to me from a Power Greater than myself. He is real to me in ways I never imagined would be true. Interestingly enough, my life seemed to take on the same steps that you followed in the book.... without my even realizing it. Thank you again. Hope to meet you someday ... if not here then ... in the hereafter! This is truly a gift to us all from Him. Thanks for being the messenger."
5,A Modern Fable,"Boy, I wish people didn't compare this book to the Celestine Prophesy, I didn't like that one at all...This book is wonderful for anyone (woman or man, tho I think the intended audience is women) needing encouragement and self esteem.I wrote down the six commandments from the book for myself and I'm passing the book on to a friend with instructions to pass it on when they're done with it (sorry, Amazon... less sales that way, but it's THAT kind of book). ;-)Enjoy."
3,"It was okay, but...","I can't believe all the people who thought this was a great book. Perhaps they have read very few spiritual fables. I loved the opening part about the nurse's return home and her bad man (the surgeon) but after that it got really ho-hum. I mean, been there, done that! The lesson: love yourself first and foremost was a good one, but after one page, it was transmitted, transmuted and transferred. This is one of those fluffy, airy books that could have gone much deeper, but didn't. Those who wish to find true inspiration in a small book should try The Four Agreements by Miguel Ruiz. Now there's a great one!"
3,The Goblin Pearls are stolen and Lily has to find them.,The plot line of the story is that the ancient Goblon Pearls are stolen at the parade and it is up to Lily to find out who stole them. I personally thought this book was too short and didn't be very descriptive.
2,Not very engaging.,"This tells the story of a 12-year-old girl in San Francisco's Chinatown named Lily...who uses words such as 'madame'...'impeccable'...and knows an 'athletic build' while looking at a much older man, and makes a reference such as 'more slippery than a USC tailback.'The 'mystery' of this piece starts a few chapters in during a parade, and is kind of dropped, then resurfaces towards the end of the book.Even though this was a quick read, I didn't find any characters to root for; and, I couldn't get into the story. There wasn't really a flow in the way things unfolded.The way the characters spoke, especially Lily, seemed unrealistic. Lily speaks as if she is in a fantasy world, or even if she is an older woman; and the people around Lily also talk, or are written as romanticized characters from a Disney film."
3,"Great songs, bad remastering.","I waited almost twenty years to get these cd's from this artist because these had never been made into cd's before. The songs are wonderful and beautiful. The remastering is not. I can still hear the scratches from the record player they recorded this off of. Someone didn't know how to master this recording to get the bad static and scratches off. The treble is a bit too high too. It is a real shame, considering how beautiful the music is. Beware, if you love this music and have a tape copy of it, the cd won't sound better. The only good thing is that if you want to repeat a certain song you can with the cd."
2,NOT one of Scott's Best.....,"This is not one of Randolph Scott's better efforts. His portrayal of cattle rancher John Stewart is very wooden and shallow. The supporting cast performs no better and may in fact be even worse. I would have loved to kill Richard Boone's character strictly for bad acting job he did.If you like a movie with lots of gunplay and don't mind bad acting, or if you're a hard core Randolph Scott fan, then go for this one. If not, you can give this one a pass and not feel like you miss anything."
1,ok...,"ok, yeah, you are so freakin weid. you are scaring me. you said your a MY SCEN QUEEN!!!! i'm frighted of you. BRATZ FREAKIN ROX MY FREAKIN SOX OFF!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!(zoe)"
2,I hate bratz dolls and look at Nolee's eyes!!!!,EWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWhOPE-FULLY mYSCENE DOLLS WON'T CONTINUE THIS PRODUCT... NOLEE'S EYES LOOK LIKE BRATZ DOLL'S...UGLY BRATZ DOLL'S!!! I hope-fully won't have to make worse reveiws about this doll because I don't want to hurt feelings.But just LOOK at her people!!! Please don't buy her!!! The good Myscenes will come back soon...Hope-fully...YIKES!!!JUST THINKING ABOUT BRATZ GIVES ME THE CREEPS!!!
1,"Your not stupid, but My Scene dolls are","No, you My Scene fans are not stupid. But Bratz dolls are better then My Scene dolls. I think they are prettier and better and more fashionable than My Scene dolls. No, you are not stupid, My Scene dolls are. My Scene dolls are stupid and you know it. They stink. Bratz rule. And don't get mad at me, I didn't call you stupid, just My Scene dolls."
3,Overall pretty good except...,"Very nice...however mine had some rust inside so I had to return it. Maybe it was just mine. Otherwise, I couldn't find anything less of its value."
3,I love Tyler Perry...,"....but something just didn't set right with me though..maybe the smacking the kids around in the beginning. I thought that sent a bad message..although, I can see myself acting like that if I was Madea! Madea's character will always keep me in stitches. This movie is much more serious than Diary. There were more cuss words in this..and more abuse. I let my daughter watch this without prescreening the content and I regret not doing so. I suggest going to a content reviewing site before allowing a young teen to watch."
2,Like carring around a signboard,"This may be a good umbrella. I will never know.As soon as I opened it I discovered the large company logo on one panel of the umbrella. (I've posted a picture of the umbrella with logo with the other customer images above.) If the company wants me to carry around their advertising, they should put me on their advertising payroll. I would not have objected to a small tasteful logo, but not this garish ad.I returned the umbrella for a refund. Too bad, because it may be a good umbrella.One additional comment: This umbrella takes a significant amount of energy to open it. It may not be suitable for someone with impaired arm strength."
1,won't stay open,"Well today was the third time I used the umbrella. I opened it, walked 10 feet and it closed on me. I cannot get it to stay opened. Past the return window so I guess I am out 40 bucks. It did not fold up but so what if it will not stay open."
5,"Great product, fast shipping","I was pleasantly surprised with this product. When I saw the price I couldn't believe it because it is the same product that sells in stores for $30 or more. The shipping was super fast, I received the product in about 3 days. I couldn't be happier."
4,Zune Armband jacket,I got it quickly and it is fine. I already have one that I ordered for my daughter and they are great.
3,Nice mats but dont fit that well.,"These are nice, and look great but the fitment isnt that good. They stick up around the edges and dont mate up in the corners to lay down correctly."
2,not happy,"They do not fit very well for something that is exact fit.Will make do with them , I had to cut them to make them somewhat work. They are not worth the money. Would not recomend."
3,Great album... and I'm not ashamed to admit it...,"Yes, people laugh at the mere mention of Milli Vanilli, but I have to admit that they (whomever they are!) made at least 4 great songs that stick in my head to this day. Too bad they've stopped making this CD, as I'm sure there are plenty out there who'd love to buy it."
4,very good,"This album is out-of-print, but thanks to the used CD market, CD-burners, and MP3 trading, it lives on.If you are a fan, I believe there are 4 additional solid tracks to consider from the European album (non-remixed): Can't You Feel My Love, Boy In the Tree, Money, Hush."
2,"i will give em two stars for tryin! their failure? well, blame it on da rain!","i am not gonna be one of those to trash and verbally demean this music and it's performers. truthfully, milli vanilli was the funk back in 1988 and 1989. i would blast it through my newly purchased realistic radio and eq/power booster with a pair of 6x9's and boy, you cruise next to your high school gymnasium and all the chicks were sweatin ya! i save one star reviews for music which is total ca-ca. in retrospect, milli vanilli had some listenable moments back in da day and it brings back fond memories of cruising into the night in my 1976 chevy monte carlo and that first car audio system i bought at radio shack with my first part time check! ah those warm summer days in '88!there were a couple of great ""breakdowns"" with a lotta bass boom on ""Baby Don't Forget My Number"" and the title track ""Girl You Know It's True"". Heck, i'd give dis two and a half stars if amazon allowed it!"
5,Fillet Knife,"This knife is a superlative addition to any cook's collection. A ""Must Have"" item, attractively priced."
4,Great reading for YAs,I found this book to be an excellent way to introduce young adults to nutrition and encourage them into good eating habits. The author does a nice job of explaining the importance and ease of watching what you eat and why.
1,DEFECTIVE item,Skips and misses in various places throughout the CD. Very disappointing as I remember all of these old Irish songs and was anxious to reminisce.
3,What a Love -Lost !,"The deception and deceit Wellington and Jade endured was such a love lost ! While Jada proved Wellington was her soul mate .I was not sure Wellington thought the same ! He was to busy thinking with the wrong head. Which cost him more than he was willing to give or see thru . Wellington was not willing, or just could not see through the deception, deceit and connivingness inflicted on him until it was to late . His mother and godsister cost him to lose a love so true ! Near the end I was begining to think Jada was going to be just a little to forgiving ? While SMD was not all that I thought it could have been ,it was an okay read ! The sex scenes where not as passionated as I thought but they were good ! I do look forward to seeing if there is a sequel to Jada and Wellington's saga ! Maybe she will or maybe she won't ? Life does go on Jada !"
4,What a great read!,"This was a really good book. Once I started reading, I couldn't put it down. Reading about the Jones'deep, dark family secrets added more to the story. Looking forward to reading Part 2."
2,Quality?,"Good representation of melodies. It would have been more enjoyable if they had used a better recording device to capture the sound. I think that wax cylinders went out of favor back in the 1920's. (Very limited dynamic and acustic range) Presentation is slightly better than the ""average"" high school drum and bugle corps."
3,Good book if you don't have the manual or other photo books,"The Magic Lantern series is a decent set of books used to explain the nuances of your 35mm. However, considering the price of this pocket-sized manual, the original users manual (Canon's is pretty decent) plus a good 35mm photography book are more than adequate."
3,filters,its just like any other filters. the seller was nice and i got a good price but for the filter is the same as the rest.
3,Butterfly Kit- Easy Flier Problem,"Just purchased this kite and tried flying several times. It is easy to launch and achieve height. However, the kite will list to the left side and dive straight to earth. This occurs even if the kite is high (300 ft) and no change in wind speed. I can tell the wind is adequate because there is adequate resistance on the string as this buddy swan dives. The listing is always to the left. Once it enters its death roll, it cannot be pulled out. I have an intermediate level of experience flying kites, and can't prevent this thing from crashing. I look forward to examining this kite for imperfections in the seams or asymmetry; problem is it currently is 50 ft above the ground in a tree. We also have the Large Easy Flyer Dog kite - it works as advertised. Flies well."
5,"This kite IS an ""easy flyer.""",This kite takes off before you even let the string out! Very nice compared to another kite we have that we can only get off the ground in strong winds. I'd say this one is good for all ages. We are glad we bought it so that our son will think kindly of kite-flying.
4,CD is an excellent collection of piping pieces,"This CD is the grand-daddy of piping CDs. I've many piping CDs, and this by far the best of them. The rendition of Amazing Grace is superb, the piobreachd lament is haunting, and the drumming track is so fast that it hurts my wrists to listen! A must buy for any enthusiast of the music of the Highland bagpipes."
3,GOOD GUN BUT NOT AS PIC,OK I HAD TO WAIT MORE THEN WEEK IT WAS TO COME TO MY HOUSE ON THE 23 BUT IT CAME 1ST NEXT MOTH THAT ONE AND AHLAF WEEK LATE AND WHEN I GET THE GUN IT WAS WITH SHORT CLIP NOT LONG
4,expedited shipping was waste of money,"While the product was as advertized and packed well, the box didn't leave the seller for 4 business days and took an additional 5 days enroute. This is NOT expedited shipping and was a waste of $15.00. Not again..."
3,"Very Descriptive, but much too long","I admire anyone who writes a book, esp. a book well over 800 pages. I really like the concept of the time travel and the romance, and the period of history in Scotland is very compelling. The characters Claire and Jaime, as well as some of the minor characters like Murtagh were very well developed. And the descriptions of the imagined life at that time were quite good.But the book dragged in points. I found myself surfing the last few hundred pages. I didn't put it down, because I was involved with the characters and wanted to find out what happened...but I wasn't involved enough to read every word.I am torn as to whether to read the next one, or find the cliff notes."
1,Wrong book cover,"I love this book and have the whole series in the original cover. Unfortunately, I loaned my copy of Outlander to a friend who lost it. I wanted to get another copy with the original cover to replace the one that was lost. I understood that I was getting the original cover when I placed this order. However, when the package arrived I saw that I got the new blue cover instead. I was very disappointed. I think the advertising was very misleading. You will notice that the picture shown here has the original cover and there were no notations explaining that this is not the cover I was getting."
1,Disturbing on so many levels!,"This is the most disturbing book I have ever read. I understand there were sick things going on back in that time period but did she need to put the sick and twisted images of males raping each other sadistically in my mind. I think not. This book is just sickening that an author can describe something so disgusting. She should be ashamed and seek help for the perverse things she writes about. I read this book a year ago and every once in a while I will see her book on the shelf at a library and first shutter and then want to throw it away, and if you knew me I DO NOT believe in throwing books away. This book is trash and I would never reccomend it to anyone!"
1,Disturbing and disgusing,"I do not understand why so many people like this book. I found it disturbing and disgusing. Jamie beats and rapes Claire. Not something I look forward to in a book. I quit reading at the torture rape of Jamie by the villian who looks like Claire's husband. SICK, SICK, SICK!!!!!!"
5,A story to lose yourself in.,"Once you've read this book, the first of seven, you will be duing to read the rest. It has everything. This is a story of time travel,war, love, courage and is most intriguing. I first read this book ten years ago and have read it many times since. Don't forget to read the accompanying Lord John series. I have been in love with Jamie for the last ten years."
4,fascinating,This is a must read for any historical fiction lover. The only reason I did not give this 5 stars was the graphic rape scene that was rehashed too often.
5,Soooo good!!,"Okay so I'm still pretty young (16)... but my sister recommended it to me after she read it, and I've been obsessed with the series ever since. It's such a wonderful adventure story that keeps you on the edge of your seat... mixed with lots of romance that doesn't drag you down!! It's such an amazing book and the writing style of it is completely brilliant. It isn't another airport terminal romance novel... it's an excellent book! Jamie is a gorgeous character who won't let you put the book down! Make sure you have plenty of time set aside to read this book because you won't have a clue where the time goes! The bottom line?? It's a wonderful book and it comes with a 5 star rating from me. However... if it had been possible, I would have given it 10 stars. Enjoy!"
5,Reading them for the 3rd time!!!!!!!!,"I am so excited. I read the first 3 in 1995. And after marriage and two kids I am reading them again. This time I get to read Drums of Autum. Just realized there is a 4th. Boy am I HAPPY! These books are the best. I would recommend them to anyone. I wanted to jump in the book and live with them, follow them on their journeys, knock Jamie over the head for being such a man. The first time I read these books I read them in 2 weeks. I lived with these books in my hands. At work I was worthless. Diana has truly given me an escape to another time. I truly love and recommend these books. Thank you Diana for Jamie and Claire."
1,Disappointed,"I love romance, adventure and/or time travel books. But I was very disapointed in this book. The violence was just too much for me to take. There should have been a warning about the graphic descriptions of rape and torture. I found it not only unnecessary, but very distracting to what could have been a really good story."
1,I tried,"With all of the great reviews, I really tried hard to like this book but I just didn't. I got half way through and had enough."
5,ENGROSSING,"The first title in Diana Gabaldon's ""Outlandish"" series. The story of Jamie and Clare in Jacobite Scotland is completely engrossing. 20th Century Clare falls through the standing stones to be taken in with a group of marauders in 18th century Scotland. Their adventures are compelling and thrilling. The character studies are vivid, the writing flawless. This book (along with Dragonfly in Amber) invokes all kinds of emotions and left me breathless. It made me want to go to Scotland to fall through the standing stones. Be prepared to spend a week of sleepless nights - you won't be able to put this one down."
3,Good read,A little slow but good. I felt as if the book should have been split into a couple different books. It gets a little long in some spots and seems to drag on but is otherwise an action packed romance.
5,Good read,"Enjoyed the characters. Easy to follow. Well written. I would recommend this book. Yes it had some romance in it but that only made the dynamics between the characters better. Also, the historic context was well done."
3,Too much romance for me!,"Although I enjoyed the storyline, I am not a ""romance"" reader and this was definitely a romance. With way, way too much sex for my taste. I don't think I'll spend the money on another one of these books."
5,The Greatest Book Ever!,"My mother should not have given me this book before my finals.I got so hooked on the charactors that I had to go through all fourbooks within 2 weeks time. It is an excellent story, there is no wonder that the series is so popular. This is the greatest piece of historical fiction that has ever been written and I recommend it to people of all ages. It deserves hundreds of stars, but since I can only give 5, 5 will have to do."
