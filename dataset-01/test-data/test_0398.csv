3,Good Monitor BUT....,"This monitor seems to have everything--three year warranty, excellent color, height, tilt and swivel adjustments, built in speakers--BUT the monitor settings are not user friendly and make it difficult to make any quick changes."
2,Beyond Hitler's Grasp,"Serious errors in documentation and unnecessary repetition mar this otherwise interesting work. Bar-Zohar cited Groueff's Crown of Thorns repeatedly, yet even more often copies large sections from Groueff's work verbatim and without acknowledgement. This is extremely disturbing in a supposedly professional historical study. The only area in which Bar-Zohar seems to go out on his own is the period following King Boris' death, an area outside the scope of Groueff's study. For that time period the work is useful; otherwise, read Crown of Thorns instead, or at least, read it first."
2,Check local stores first.,Similar sets of what I'd consider a better quality can be purchased locally at box stores. Was more excited while I was waiting for them then I was when they got to me.
1,"Retainers break, hooks keep falling out, waste of money","I bought a set of hooks only from this company last year. It's really, really bad. I'll never get anything from Crawford again. I don't care that the hooks are made of thin wire and don't hold much weight, that's plenty fine for most tools. It's that the hooks refuse to stay on the board. The little plastic retainers that are supposed to hold the metal hooks in place don't. They are difficult to get in place, use up holes that could have been for other hooks, fall out of the holes after a few uses, and get stiff and break in half with age. Overall, the whole package is a waste of money. Every time I try to remove a tool from the board, the hook comes with it and falls on the floor. I was putting them back up, now I just throw them in the trash. Give it a pass and get pegboard hooks that have a second metal stud on the back to hold them in place."
1,terrible,"I loved the old Helmet, I must have listened to it non stop for years. I was very disappointed when size matters came out, but this is so bad I can hardly listen to the old stuff anymore. It is so bad that it makes me sick, really. The music is fair but as soon as he sings its lights out. Don't waste your money or time on this one."
5,"Excellent album, but don't pay $50 for it !!!!!","This is one of my favorites from back in high school. Phil Driscoll is not for everybody, but as a trumpet player myself, I love Phil Driscoll's trumpet playing. My old cassette wore out years ago from overuse, and I never tried to replace it until recently. Imagine my shock to see it for sale here on Amazon for $50!! What madness!! This album is not out of print, it is still available for about $16 from Phil Driscoll's Website, phildriscoll.com or mightyhorn.com. You can also listen to samples there. His CD's are also available from online Christian retailers like christianbook.com.Bottom line - Get it, but by all means, don't get ripped off!!!"
4,Jeff is one of the best rockers ever,"I've always enjoyed this old album. I've recently upgraded to CD. I don't know why I waited so long. This is a nice collection (not complete, but nice nonetheless). Not a bad song on this one."
1,Poor performer,"The flash did not work well. In TTL mode, the pictures came out so dark. It performed worse than the built-in flash on my D50. In Hi Man mode, the pictures were too bright, completely washed out. In Low Man, the pictures were dark but slightly brighter than TTL mode. I returned since there is no point to have an add-on flash that's is worse than the built-in flash."
4,Houston Texans!,"If you are a Texans fan, or know any ladies/girls that are, these are perfect!They are not too big, not too small. Perfect size!"
5,Love it,Fast shipping really like the earrings they are just like the picture I can't wait to wear them For the next game
5,Colloquial Persian taught well and fast.,"This is one of the Spoken Language Series, which began during the Second World War when the U.S. government hired the best linguists of the day to produce courses that would teach languages to soldiers fast. It is the same method used to teach languages to U.S. diplomats today.The book presents colloquial, everyday language and teaches forms that appear only in conversation. It is not as useful for learning reading. It is an effective and very enjoyable way to learn languages.However, the student should also consider Wheeler Thackston's ""Introduction to Persian,"" which is more recent, and has, in my opinion, caused ""Spoken Persian"" to drop to second place. Thackston has nine sound cassettes available--if not from the book dealer, then from the publisher (that is where I got them); it teaches spoken and written Persian, lacks the defects of previous textbooks, and is more thorough, effective and enjoyable than any of its rivals."
2,Even third graders won't like this book!,"Meh...a good kids' book. It kept me interested, but there were many ""cheesy"" sections that ended way too ""neatly"" for me. There was also no recognizable ""bad guy"" which makes a plotline sort of boring and unrecognizable.The nice thing about this book was that it was not your typical Robbin Hood/Maid Marian novel. Marian was more of a hero herself in this version, making it an empowering book for young girls, and for any reader that is sick of Marian having to be ""rescued"" all the time. While the takes on the characters were refreshing, unfortunately it did not save the book from the all-too-simple plotline and underdeveloped supporting characters.The writing was easy and didn't flow very well. Even third graders might not enjoy this book.Two stars."
4,"A good book, with well developed characters","I just finished this book and it was an excellent depiction of srong women who live wild in the forest and help sick people. The characterizations were awesome, most especially Marian, who was an incredibly cool character in this book, unlike most other Robin Hood stories, so characters get five stars. The plot was good also, though I wish more of the action had actually taken place in the story. Instead, all the outlaws would go out and fight a battle ""offscreen"", and then come back and tell the other characters about it, so plot gets three and 1/2 stars. Writing style and dialogue were possitively breathtaking, with true old style flair, so it also gets five stars. So, altogether this book wins a unanimous four stars, which is excellent. This book would be best for kids ten to fifteen, as younger kids probably wouldn't get most of it."
4,This book wasn't bad I thought it was great!,I don't see why a lot of people think this book was so horrible! I don't see anything wrong with it. I thought it was funny and I also thought it taught a good lesson! And I think that lesson is that you should be yourself because everyone that cares about you now cares about you because of who you are and if you change who you are then you never know how the people who already cared about you would react. And most likly the people that care about you for who you are are the most important people to you. So I think that you sould read this book and give it a try! Like I said it's funny and teaches a good lesson!
3,"Good story, but....","This is a good tale of friendship, and jealousy that can make you do strange things. However, it's also, in a way, about sidesaddle riding. And that's where it falls apart for me. The author doesn't seem to know much about the subject. I've ridden aside for 10 years, and never seen anyone wear pink britches, or call the horns (or pommels) ""knee rests."" It always irks me when an author doesn't do some very basic fact-checking."
5,A great book for the begginer investor......... :-),I think that this is an excellent book for anyone wanting to learn how the worlds most famous investor made his riches or anyone wanting to follow in his footsteps.As a 14 year old who loves business and investing ......... this book can be read and understood by almost anyone
4,A glipse of the past,"Those who are looking for the more esoteric parts of John Dee's life will not find it in this book -but- will find an understanding of who he was as a person. Being a book of medieval history, it tends to center more on John Dee the Mathematician, John Dee the Philosopher, and John Dee the Poltician (or advisor). I believe French paints an accurate picture as is possible of John Dee and England in the 1500's. Since this is a very scholarly and well-referenced book it can be a little dry if books on history do not interest you. Ultimately, though, I came away from the book with an admiration for the genuis of this man which no book on just the esoteric parts of his life will ever provide."
4,"Not divine, but very great","This very good album may not be one of Cohen's best albums, but that's only because most of the other albums are so divine. It also seems to be Cohen's forgotten album. It's partially his own fault, because last year he didn't put any track of ""Recent songs"" on his ""More greatest hits"" album, but it had been forgotten for a longer period of time. Yet this album has some splendid songs like: ""The Guests"", ""My Gypsy Wife"", ""Our lady of Solitude"" and there aren't any bad songs, except maybe for ""The lost Canadian"". True, except for ""Death of a Ladies' man"" I like all the other albums better than this one, but still it remains a great album."
5,Keiko Matsui,This is a fine album by Keiko Matsui and I enjoy listening to it. I'm glad to have it part of my collection.
2,Feet to meters,Very informative book however the author (who was born and raised in the USA) has all measurements in meters. He must just be laughing at us complaining about it. I would not purchase the book because if you have hiked for decades and know how long a mile is and know how much ground in miles you can cover in a day and how much water you need for a lets say a 9 mile hike you will be totally frustrated by this book and if your wrong in your 7th grade conversion computation you could be for example out of water before you reach your destination. So you see it's not just annoying it could be dangerous.
2,Warning- Lake is now a different place,"The book overall, is ok, and provides some good general information. However, in no fault to the author, the lake levels have dropped about 100ft since the book was written. Where there may have been a beach and a trail 4 years ago, you will now find a 50ft. cliff. Regardless lake powell is still an awesome place, check it out."
3,Good for insurance adjusters,"finally a book that tells the truth about ""whiplash"". if everyone would read this book then maybe we could end the whole lie that is whiplash!"
3,"basic, but you need to update the driver for wpa","The best thing about this old Asante AL1611 wifi-b card is that it only protrudes 1cm. I use it mainly for surfing in coffee shop with an old Portege 3480CT (P3-600) XP-based laptop, and its fine. Range is mediocre.This card is based on an old Realtek 80211b chipset, and the driver in the package is outdated. To get both WEP & WPA compatibility you must you update to the RTL8180L driver (version 173) - look for this filename: ndis5x-8180(173).zip on the net. (I downloaded it from the Realtek website in Taiwan) I did this and it worked just fine right away.The mfg/dealer rebate of $10 never came through, so I paid $20 for it back in 2004. If you can get it for about $10 or less and just need basic connectivity, its good for what it is. (from Canada, Mar 2008)"
4,This is one of the best comics of the decade,"The simpson have been since they appeard, the perfect match between irony and sensitivity. This familiy represents the critisim of the new american way of life. Again, Matt Groeing presents his own world through the exceptionals characters of Lisa, Homero, Bart and of course the little Maggie. As usual with humor and with a solid script, the simpson are still going... now better than ever."
4,It's cool,"They're from Vancouver B.C. and wow, I didn't think them cupcakes could rap without saying ""eh?"" But they do. It's good. I like track 14 myself."
1,Anyone from Ohio should be insulted,This book rots. I am from Ohio and am very upset by his stero-type of Ohioans. Not all of us are farm living bible thumping backwood morons. Also there is no such amusment park in Ohio so get you map out peabrain. Beyond that Honey was just stupid. It's like she fell out the dumb tree and hit every branch and then the roots. I think most girls from Ohio would know enough not to go to New york then run off to any unkown aparment with the first man she meet. Typical for a man to write a book were the women are nothing but stupid mindless spineless slobs. Get a clue take some writing class and stop trashing V.C. Andrews good name.
1,More help plz,I need to write a reprt on Christy so i need full length stuff guys! HELP PLZ SOS!!!!!!
4,works great as chicken netting,Our chickens where flying the coop... literally. Bought this and installed over the coop and they now stay home! It has gone thru some rain and snow and looks the same as day one. Easy to use and seems strong.
1,I could have been doing my laundry!!!,"I thought at first that the idea behind this movie would be kind of cute. Started watching it and became desillusioned very quickly. This homemade movie is filled with stereotypes of what gay men should be. Not only that but it also mentions what gay men should not be such as older, more bulky and anything that is not twink. The story is not funny although this is a comedy. I have to say the actors in the movie were laughing a lot more than we were, watching them. Horrible movie, bad acting..."
2,IT NEEDS MORE THAN ATTITUDE,"Avoid this movie, it is almost unwatchable. Save your money or better still send the money directly to the director who can then afford to purchase a tripod on which to place his camera and if there is any money over he could put it towards post synching the dialogue.The premise of the plot is quite good, however it really needs a charismatic lead actor and unfortunately this movie does not have one. A lost opportunity."
2,"Doesn't get carried correctly, chewed in 1 day","The picture for the product was hilarious, but my dog doesn't carry it that way, I don't think any dow will. My dog chewed it up in less than a day."
3,Portable Organizer,"Bins are nice and roomy, easy to take out if needed. Handle on top is a nice feature. BIG DOWNSIDE is this bin does not work with the Crawford peg board. It has pins on it that do not align with the holes in the pegboard. I ended up screwing it to the wall, which was not my original plan. It may fit on other pegboards but the manufacturer should have made it fit their own product."
1,1 star is generous - Crap Product ***Beware***,"I ordered several of these units for my garage and they are all now sitting in a landfill because I was too slow in getting them returned. To begin, the plastic on these is crude, brittle, and poorly trimmed. The teeth that hold it to the peg board break off very easily... do not expect to take this on and off the wall, as advertised, for long. The bins are small and the product is overall very cheaply made. Beware if you want something of lasting quality."
3,looks can be decieving,"Product arrived in specified time,packaged well.Fits,so the correctb size was ordered.The problem seems to be design,though I might be using it for the wrong purpose.I have a torn medial meniscus,having surgery tomorrow infact,this padded ""donought ""hole pad ring putts preasure on it.To the point of exreme discomfort.Might not be the products fault but my mis-application.Is it to prtevent injury,so to be worn before,or I might find it a god send after surgery while working to prevent another meniscus tear,I've had 2 medial and lateral."
3,this could have been a really good book...,"This could have been a really good book, but this interesting and readable treatment of South Korea's economic history is marred by wild polemics. Ultimately, it is a descriptive, not analytical, work, and hence of questionable utility in understanding the present or future."
3,Can someone help me with this DVD?,"I love this movie! I was so excited when I purchased it the day this Special Edition was released, however, I can't seem to find all the Special Features. When I click on Special Features, I only get the Rob Reiner audio commentary and the trivia. Where are the featurettes that are suppose to be included? Are they easter eggs? Please help!! It's killing me! Thanks."
4,Still a great way to pass time..,"Very funny, surprisingly human off-beat love story. I've watched it over and over again, and still laugh as hard. Be advised portions are pretty adult, but the underlying theme is that real love is worth the wait, the sacrifice, and sometimes comes quite unexpected. The only reason that I didn't give it 5 stars is that you need to leave somewhere to go for ""Something about Mary.."""
5,middle class ra-ra in the best way possible,"This film is reponsible for the name of the next first born male in our family. We were all mid-teen siblings when we stumbled across this gem in the late 80s. We had to wait until one of us was married and up the duff when the ubiquitous question, 'What are you going to call it?' ('What?"". 'The baby!')would be asked. Never was there a doubt and as John Cusack would have it, the boy was called ""NICK"". If you don't see (and enjoy) this film you should be asking yourself some pretty confronting questions. Like, ""am I a moron?'"
4,"""Life is the Ultimate Experience."" Experience this DVD! ! !","Director's commentary from Rob Reiner is a plus. It's great to have this title on DVD, finally. Cusack, Zuniga and Lindfors all give superb performances. A must-see romantic comedy!"
3,2.5 stars out of 4,The Bottom Line:The Sure Thing's sweetness somewhat makes up for the fact that it embraces formula like it was a virtue: it's a likeable movie but not an accomplished one.
2,A little disappointed,"When listening to this CD, I was a little disappointed. this CD offers nothing to make it stand out from the overpopulated (and undertalented) rap/rock crowd. The lead singer's voice and flow definately borrow from fred durst, so limp bizkit haters should avoid this CD like the plague. Overall, if you are a big fan of the rap/rock genre, then Nullset could be a good band for you to check out. Songs with riffs like ""Smokewood"" and ""Speechles"" are undeniable catchy. However, if you are not too big a rap rock fan, then Nullset will not turn you on to this genre."
4,Fun with Wii boxing,This game is incredibly fun and even better with the gloves! The gloves defintely get you into the mindset of the game and you can get more of a workout in turn.A good purchase for any gamer and/or boxing fan!
4,Wii Boxing Fun,Boxing was something that we enjoyed playing on our Wii when we first received it. We also like Wii fit and some of the other exercising games. These games also have boxing - bag punching moves. These gloves allow you to think more about the exercise and punches which better work you core. No more worrying if the remotes will fly out of your hands as they are secure. We have discovered boxing all over again.
2,More trouble than they are worth,"If you have older generation wii controllers that have the wii motion plus extension, then they will not fit in these gloves. I planned to use these for one of my wii cardio boxing games but I found these gloves to be cumbersome and actually stopped my game to take them off. For whatever reason the sensors couldn't pick up my punches while wearing the gloves and because my controllers didn't fit into the slots it made the whole thing awkward. I would not recommend this gloves as to me they aren't worth it."
2,Whooaaaa...,"Okay, there's an obvious reason to why there aren't many tribute bands or albums out there... The Smashing Pumpkins are a TERRIFIC band, and that's an understatement. I doubt anyone can reproduce their songs and pull it off. The same goes to this album. Two stars for at least going for it, and good try, though, guys."
3,please be nice,"Hi, I really don't understand why these reviewers don't understand tribute albums. This album's songs are in no way trying to imitate the Pumpkins. They could never do that. The bands who contributed to this tribute never intended to do that. These songs approach Billy's music from a fresh angle. You think these covers really [stink], but you're just used to the Pumpkins playing them. These bands have the guts to do something unconventional with their covers, much like how Billy has always kept inconsistent with popular music. The gothic-industrial tribute (not this tribute but the another one) to the Pumpkins is beautiful. The only problem with the album is the close-minded listener who listens to it, but can't re-assess the Pumpkins' music in its altered form. Amen."
2,RC Super Sonic Airplane,"This STYROFOAM plane is of poor quality, the wings and nose broke on the first fall, even tho is was on grass, and the wheels are useless. The weight is not well balanced, so flight is difficult, unless you re-balance it. Thankfully my boyfriend was able to do this, along with gluing and taping pieces of things together to ""recreate"" the airplane so it was still usable for our daughter. If you are creative, and able to rebuild plane, this is great to learn on, if you have no clue how to re-make parts (wings and nose mainly) expect to only be able to crash the plane one time (not good for beginners, they crash many times)Not worth the money in my opinion, and NOT FOR BEGINNERS!!"
3,"Fun, until it breaks","This plane does not take off from the ground! Just to let you know... I don't even know why it's got wheels, as it can't even fly straight, let alone run straight.However, if you throw it hard, you can have it flying in no time. The problem, as mentioned above, is that it does not fly straight, no matter how much you try to preset the ailerons and rudder. The remote control doesn't help either, as the plane doesn't seem to respond well to it. This makes it a very hard plane to fly, even though it is intended for beginners.In conclusion, it is a good toy for $25, but don't expect too much!"
4,Fun to use but difficult to control at first....... i guess,"I bought this item mainly to get a taste of RC planes and copters. I have always been interesting in flight and since i cant afford a real one, this is as close as ill get.I havnt had much time to use the plane but its very hard to fly it windy conditions, but that manual says that it would be anyway, but just thought i would give it a try.Been that i havnt flown it much(probaly tried like 3 times), the only sure review that i could give, is that its very...very easy to assemble. Putting it together is kind of the fun part to, kinda makes you feel like an engineer... :D"
1,Horrible product,It looks like a plane and works as it is intended(engines work with remote) but the engines aren't balanced so one is dramatically more powerful than the other. there is no trim feature to resolve this issue so I couldn't even get the plane in the air for more than 3 seconds. handled crashing well in that it didn't fall apart but if it doesn't actually fly then I don't think that matters much. could be a faulty product but at this price I doubt it.
2,"Aqarium Widescreen DVD - Coral Reef, Saltwater and Freshwater Fish Tank Virtual Experience",If you want an Aquarium on you TV then this is for you.Was a bit boring for me after watching Reefscapes.
3,Slightly misleading - really 3 cables not one,"This is slightly misleading - it's not one single cable with 3 RCA connectors, it's 3 *separate* cables with colour-coded connectors. It's a little less neat than having them all bound up with a single outer sleeve. Also, one end of the Blue connector on mine did not fit the socket on the TV without having to rotate it (as if the plug wasn't completely round).It works, but it is not what I expected and it definitely could be better."
4,Good quality cable but colour marking can be confusing.,This product represents good value and appears to be a good quality cable. The only minor problem I found was that the colour coded bands around each connector can be slightly confusing if you are connecting your cable to the back of your equipment in poor light as the green and blue look rather similar.
4,Go All the Way- Isley's last great album together,"Glad this album finally came out on CD. Have it on vinyl. Only weak song is ""Belly Dancer"". ""Here we go"" and ""Don't say goodnight"" are classics. Last great album with all 6 Isleys/Jasper/Isleys together."
3,Family Prevails,"Dance, Kayla! starts out as Kayla does--full of promise. Kayla's life on her grandparents' farm is interesting as are the people in her life, but the story slows down when she reaches the big city. While the characters were sometimes flat, the story fills an important function in that it shows the strength of an extended African American family. It also serves to inspire young girls of color to follow their dreams, no matter how many roadblocks stand in their way."
5,I learn something watching these,"I purchased for my 3 year old son. He loves them! We sing the song together at the beginning of the show. I've actually learned a lot watching these with him! They're well made and edited, and keep his attention."
1,Wrong information,Having an aspergers child that likes watching this show I was very disappointed. I work for an airline and the episode At The Airport gives the wrong aircraft types. The A320 is really an airbus. And the Dc10 is not that either. It's hard enough finding tv shows that spark his attention and since he is on the autism spectrum he takes this information as the truth. If you have an aspie child more wise not to let them watch this one.
4,Mighty Machines is Mighty Entertaining for whole family....,"...found this children's program by accident one day when I was channel surfing.I happened upon the ""QUBO"" channel and there it was!With it's catchy theme music and clever narration I found myself tuning into the shows whenever I would catch it on.Very entertaining for the kids.Captures the attention of boys and girls."
1,CHEAP CRAP,"LIKE A LOT OF THE OTHERS, THE SEAMS CAME APART AND NOW MY BED LOOKS PREGNANT. LESS THAN 2 MONTHS OLD. IF YOU ARE A 'BIG' PERSON DON'T BUY THIS!"
3,Air bed,Satisfied w air bed. Co offers no return or refunds after opened. No way to know if good until you open!!
4,A restful sleep,"I purchased the Intex Pillow Rest Queen Airbed for a special guest who has stated being sleeping comfortable and restful. I like this product because it's affordable, easy to build and accommodate."
2,"Great, for a while. Then, not so much.","I bought this because I'm renovating my house and then moving, so only really planned to use it for a few months.It was amazingly comfortable for about 25 days and then one (or possibly two) of the internal struts came loose from the base. This caused one side of the mattress to be higher than the other, making for a suddenly pretty crappy bed. It's a shame, really, because it was extremely (and surprizingly) comfortable.I tried to get a replacement, thinking I may have just got a defective item, and I see now that the item is under review. I'm guessing this, or a similar thing, has happened to others. Sad story!For now, I have replaced it with the non-""pillow rest"" version of the bed, hoping that I won't get the same problem."
5,Works like a charm,"We got this air matress several months ago for a visiting friend, and we've used it now on multiple occasions. It works perfectly, with a convenient air pump to both inflate and deflate the matress. It loses almost no air, if any. We're perfectly happy - just what we needed and for a nice amount less than the top-of-the-line models."
5,Intex Air Bed,"I have had several air beds and the problem is always inflation and to a lesser extent deflation.This is the easiest air bed I have ever had. I will never buy another air bed unless it has a built in air pump. It pumps up in a matter of a few minutes and deflates by simply opening the valve and pumping the air out.Funny, but sleep is a secondary thing to ease of use, yes, it sleeps great my wife and I slept on this for a few nights and it is easy to get in and out of and sleeps great.I give this air bed my unqualified endorsement."
3,It's Okay,"It's a nice bed for guests who are not staying too long...3 years later the bed inflates..but deflates in less than an hour with two people on it and makes for the most uncomfortable night ever !Intex is overall is a good brand, I am not sure if 3 years is the typical life expectancy (with an average of the bed being used 3 weeks a year) but ours did not make it til the end :-("
1,Intex Pillow Rest Queen Airbed,"I have several Intex products, and I have found the Airbed to be the worst of all of them. If you like sleeping on the hard floor it is fine. Air pump works fine and the matterss holds air for a couple of hours. But I found myself sleeping on the floor in a few hours. After replacing the mattress with a new one the same thing happened. I won't buy another. Consumer reports reccomends Aero Airbed or Simmons Beautyrest Extraodinaire. I will try one of them."
1,Did not last,"I had for 3 months and one of thethers ripped off, then 2 weeks later it got a puncture and now I can't use anymore. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY. It does not last."
1,Lasted 3 nights,"We've blown up this air mattress three times:1st - when we first received it (to let it air out and make sure that it held air). Worked well.2nd - for overnight guests (air mattress was two weeks old). Worked well, felt good.3rd - for weekend guests (air mattress was two months old). DISASTER. The mattress was half-deflated by 2AM. The same thing happened to our poor guests for all three nights they were here. I'm sure they've never been happier to return to their own bed.We were incredibly careful about storing the product while not in use and there is no discernible leak (no noise) so we can't fix the problem/patch a hole. Needless to say, I am horribly disappointed. Guess it's back to the pull-out couch for our friends and family. Don't waste your money on this product if you plan on getting more than one decent use out of it."
4,Intek Airbed,"I was quite happy with this purchase, both with delivery time and the product itself. It was sturdier than I expected and fills up in less than 5 minutes. I would recommend this to anyone."
1,Lasted a couple of weeks - then POP,"This was in my closet for a while until I finally had a chance to pull it out and use it. I enjoyed sleeping on this bed immensely for the couple of weeks it lasted. No air leakage to speak of. Pretty comfy bed for an inflatable. Then one day I sat on it, heard a huge POP and right two parts of the mattress seemed to have merged and then rose higher than originally inflated and stayed extremely hard. Could not sleep on high, hard half of mattress. Could not sleep on lower half of mattress because of incline caused by higher side and mushiness of that side after pop. Futzed around deflating and inflating it to see if it could go back to normal, but nothing worked. Completely useless now."
2,Great Until Chambers Broke,This was a very comfortable air mattress until I came home one day to see that my air mattress was lopsided. The chambers that separate each side of the mattress ripped inside and from there it was shot.
1,It doesn't last for long,It was very bad. It last for less than three months then started to leak air. Don't waste your money for this item.
2,Not a substitute for a real bed,"I bought this bed to sleep on during a temporary work assignment. It easily holds two people without losing air overnight. The vinyl does stretch over time so the actual footprint of the bed gets bigger as you use it. Another problem is that, after a month and a half, one of the internal supports broke, and now two of the internal chambers have become one chamber creating a giant bump down one side of the bed. It probably would work for occasional use, but not for a permanent bed solution."
2,not so pleased with it,Purchased this for my brother who was visiting from out of town. He's a 230 lb. guy and this air bed fared well. Very little loss of air if any. The built in air pump was a clever thought. I've had a lot of air beds in the past and I can't find their pumps or the cord to their pumps. I won't have a problem with losing the pump for this air bed.follow-up review:Purchased 4/13 and today on 6/3 one of the ridges burst. so I now have a giant hump in the middle of the bed. still inflated but it's now uneven as the seams of one of the ridges just burst.
1,Lasted only 3 months,"This bed only lasted nearly 3 months. It blowout internally and it shows a big cylinder from top to bottom of the bed. It has no holes. Now, I can only send it to trash. I contacted Intex and they said they do not provide warranties for this product. However, they said they are very proud of their products on their website. Looks like they do a kind of misleading advertisement. How can they be so proud of their products if they can not have warranties for them (at least not for air beds like this one). I wish Amazon and companies like Amazon could stop selling products like this that came from China and are so bad that I felt like they are stealing my money."
1,Busted Chambers,"I bought this bed to use for one month while I save up money for a new bed set. After about a week one of the chambers burst while I was at work. I came home and saw a bubble under the covers of the bed. I left for a weekend trip and when I came back 2 more chambers were busted and I decided to return it. It was not over inflated and I still cant for the life of me figure out how or why the chambers would burst when I was not even sleeping on it. This time, I'll buy another bed from a place that I can return it locally since every review for the air beds seems to have a lot of different kind of complaints. Bottom line: if you want a raised air mattress you might have to be ready for it to not work after only a few uses."
3,not like they used to be,"I have botten one of these mattresses four years ago. They just don't make them like they used to. The mattress you can not get as firm nor get all the air out when you try to put it away. For some this may not be an issue, as for me just not up to my satisfaction of what it was."
1,not so rugged,"its not even 3 months past i buyed this item it was torn , this product is not so rugged as advertised i recommend any one not to buy this item, DON'T LOOK FOR THESE KIND OF PRODUCTS ITS NOT WORTHFULL. again foreveryone dont buy this product and do waste your time reading about this product"
1,Lasted three and one half months,"I bought this mattress for a guest bedroom and was quite satisfied the first two times we used it. On the third use, the ribs began to separate so that instead of having seven individual ribs, I had one gigantic rib and four normal ones. This rendered the air mattress useless. I asked the manufacturer if this could be repaired or replaced and of course the warranty had expired one week before the ribs started to separate. My learned lesson - get an air mattress with a good warranty."
3,DebnBoro,"Appears to be made of sturdy materials. Inflates and deflates quickly. However, it doesn't remain inflated totally. It does seep down some and have to add more air at intervals."
5,excellent product,"I'm a college student and have had this bed for almost a month now and besides the fact that its skweaky, it is an excellent product...havent had any leaks and it feels like a real bed or even softer."
1,Seams come apart,Do NOT waste your money! Bed is completely useless after three uses. Seams come apart and is impossible to sleep on
2,Popped strings,I bought this bed to use for the hurricane incase I had to stay at work. Long story short two rows of strings popped creating a large hump in the middle and making it unsleepable.
2,does not stay aired,"The air mattress was very easy to air up, less than one minute. Other than that it was not good. It didn't even stay aired up for an entire night and that is with my 90 pound daughter sleeping on it. The air mattress didn't stay firm and by morning it had lost enough air that she was sunk into the middle. Packaging was great and it inflates and deflates easily, just didn't stay as firm as it should have to sleep on all night."
5,"Awesome deal, super comfortable","I bought two for out of town family to sleep on and they are sooo comfortable! The price is fantastic, quality excellent. Very easy to inflate/deflate and put back in box for storage. You won't be disappointed!"
1,scraping the bottom of the barrel,"[....] Anyway, this non-song indicates that Mariah's lost it completely. And that's without the trailer-trash video. In that she seems to be aspiring to Samantha Fox-like greatness. Best of luck. This is truly horrible. If this is any indication of what Glitter will be like then we should all be afriad; very afraid."
1,boring,"this single is boring-lacks soul, in my opinion of course. if you want the best of mariah, i recommend her recent singles from the albums MARIAH CAREY up to DAYDREAM."
1,Nervous Breakdown,"If i released a single as bad as this I would have a Nervous Breakdown as well. This is just awful, there is nothing more to be said about this trash."
3,"Nice storage, broken pegs","I initially was pretty excited about the chance to get my garage cleaned up and get the little stuff off of my workbench so I ordered a few of these, in addition to some other LeHigh Crawford accessories and every single one of them had pegs that broke off as I loaded them. I mean one of them just holds a few router bits so there was no reason for the breakage."
1,Product is not real.,After i received the item the so called 4gb mini sd card i put the card in the card reader and it read 0 a big 0 and i tried to find to 4gb but nowhere to be found. I sent an email to the seller and am now going to send it back.
5,great backpack,"I use this backpack every day and basically live out of it. It's held together perfectly considering I'm always tossing it around. Even though it says it fits up to 15.4 laptops i carry my 17 inch one with no problem whatsoever. I also carry around an assortment of cables, books, my zune, headphones, and knickknacks. I'm thankful that this thing is padded pretty heavily b/c it adds up pretty quick in concern to weight. I def recommend it because not only will it keep your things pretty well protected but the orange color can help you quickly find it if somebody snatches it."
5,Suntec Muro MP3 Player w FM Transmitter,"When I saw this product for sale the first time, I could not believe it would do what it said it would do: an FM Radio, will record off of an FM radio station, will hold 128MB (or 256MB or 512MB, where available) of MP3 files, is a VOICE RECORDER and.... will broadcast your music to an FM radio. It has a rechargable gumstick-type battery-- and comes with the charger. (I suggest getting and extra battery, so that one can be in, and one can be charging) The battery lasts a long time, considering what the unit does. I have had this out on a boat and let ""everyone listen"" to my music by tuning into ""my radio station"" (wireless). The ear buds double as the units antenna. I have used the unit to carry files and even my resume, as it can be plugged into ANY computer via a USB. Get a unit with the LARGEST amount of memory you can, as you will be loading ALL your favorite music and files. Outstanding gadget to own!"
1,More Anti-Masonic Propaganda,"Readers should not be confused by this book. It is another in a series of anti-Masonic propaganda by this writing team. What is offered is a collection of time and again proven falsehoods offered in the hope of entrapping the unsuspecting in a web of deception. If you really wish to read this work, do so. After you finish it, try reading ""The Boy who Cried Wolf"" by Richard P. Thorn or ""Is It True What They Say About Freemasonry"" by Art de Hoyos and S. Brent Morris. At some point, those who profess to be Christians must face and tell the truth."
1,Terrible Book,This book is a very annoying piece to read. It does not flow very smooth. The authors did a lot of cutting and pasting of Masonic quotes and then attack them from a religious standpoint. There is a lot of Biblical quotations and misunderstood facts. Not worth the time or money.
1,Terrible!!!!!!!!!!!!,"To all the evangelists who think they know what their talking about, Stop! Masonry holds no bounds in religion. Before you can write about a topic, such as the authors have done, you need to take an unbias look into it which the authors have not done. Don't let your religious beliefs interfere with your logic before you give whatever topic your studying a chance. From a Mason!"
3,"Sure, vintage Willie but.............","Yup, the compilation of selections flows nicely and is a good fit for Willie's unique voice. However, for Sony (and Columbia) to produce a CD that provides only 29 minutes of music(??!) is less than stellar."
3,Costume quality,"The Third Task Costume is super cute, fit great, and was a big hit with my son. However, the material is extremely thin, and probably wont last through many washings. This seems to be a great 'occasional' costume i.e. for halloween or a party but not for a dress-up costume. If worn in a cold climate definately get the next size up to wear warm clothing underneath, maybe even if your child will wear it in public as its thin enough to be see thru."
3,"Great Planner, but Poor Room Designs","This is an EXCELLENT book for those who wish to run a small public haunted house. The planning guides and preparation run-throughs are excellent. My only problem with this book is that the sample room designs are rather trite and not very well done. None of them are good ""walk-through"" scares, and almost all of them require a guide of some kind. I will use this book when it comes to preparing for the Haunt, but I won't be using any of this material inside of it."
5,Very under-rated,"A whole lot of people haven't heard about this movie because I don't think it was in the movie theatre. It was probably one of those directed straight to video movies. Anyways, you'll be pleasantly surprised with this movie. It's very entertaining and I like Constance Marie LOL. The point is the action is pretty good and the revelations that surface make the movie go. Scott Glenn did a great job too despite his sharp tongued character but we like our heroes with a mean streak because you know the bad guys won't win. I recommend this movie for anyone that wants to see something new. You'll be quite surprised!"
1,Not for you if you are a programmer....,"Ok, I confess it. I am a programmer. My desire was pretty simple. I wanted a book that would show me all of the parts of Applescript and how to use them.This is NOT that book. You can see the sample scripts but very little explains how to take that information to make scripts of your own.This book has lots of sample scripts, but since I am not interested in scripting those applications, it isn't helpful to me.Perhpas I just wanted too much, but I sent this book back."
4,"Amazing collectable, great read","Got this after a desire to collect the 9-11 comics as my ending run in comic collecting, and I must say I am impressed with not only the size of it, but the consitent and diverse work inside. Loads of unfamiliar work that perhaps wouldn't be seen on such a public level with such quality, and at 200 pages for the price its at, its damn good.The stories themselves? Some make you think. Some make you wonder. All make you remember."
4,"If you like Carrie Fisher's interviews, you'll like this","Of all the actors from Star Wars, the one I most enjoy watching in interviews is Carrie Fisher. She has a sense of humor which she brings with her onto ""Wishful Drinking."" In fact, if you've watched her interviews, a lot of the quips from the interviews are on this video -- or maybe it's the other way around. I liked seeing her onstage interacting with the audience and the video clips and photos from her childhood. She talks about being the daughter of celebrities, the complicated nature of her family, her relationships with her mother and father, drugs, alcohol and mental illness. Somehow, she finds a way to laugh at it all and I laughed right along with her. If you enjoy watching Carrie Fisher's interviews, you'll enjoy this."
3,Not quite what I expected mildly amusing,If you want to hear all the dirt on Hollywood stars in the 60s and who was sleeping with who this is the movie for you....I guess I was expecting more on what was up with her addiction problems....It was amusing....
1,Thumbs DOWN,I can't believe all the positive reviews this thing got after seeing it. I guess Carrie must have a lot of friends or people in her management company to write reviews because I don't get it. There wasn't much in this that would be relevant to anybody under fifty or sixty and even then I wonder.
5,Great. great great!!!,"I never read such a beautiful book about a movie. It really gives you a good look about how the movie was made. A movie like Titanic is a lot of work and if you watch it in the cinema you don't immediately realize that. But when you read this book,you caqn almost feel the effort people made on the set. The book is also illustrated with beautiful pictures from the movie. There is just one word for this book: GREAT! Every Titanic fan is supposed to have this book!"
5,Give it 14 Oscars !!!! And they wont be enouph .....,I saw the movie 6 times and i wouldnt mind seeing it another 6.For me Titanic is the best movie ive seen in along time (and this is from a person that goes an average 3 times a week to the movies). The book accordidng to the reviews is great too ...so I couldnt say nothing that isnt already been said.READ IT FOR CERTAIN .And if I were you I would go see it -the movie- because its one of those movies that you have to see on the big screen!!!
5,Excellent,"Ever since I saw ""Titanic"" (only 4 times!) in the theater, I have been facinated with the Leviathan ship. If anyone wants to know in detail about both the movie, and the real tragic story behind it, then this is definetely the book that will let you in on everything. The photos are beautiful, and the way that hey described re-creating "" RMS Titanic"" are wonderful. **** 4 Stars"
5,pensive.. yet unsure,"I loved the movie, it actually made me cry, to realize what had happened to true love. I am just trying to figure out if Rose, and Jack really did exist.. I doubt that the story is true, but if this love story isn't fiction I am quite fascinated with this. If it is fiction, I suppose that I'll be somewhat dissapointed."
2,A disapointment,I expected the book to have a little bit more information. The book manly had pictures in it. That is where is get its two stars.
5,I love the book and movie,I saw the incredible movie many times and the book is great. I love all the pictures!!! Any fan must get this book. I am collecting everything on Titanic
5,The best film ever written &performed,"TITANIC: W O W!!!!That about sums it. Words can't describe this movie. Not only were Leo & Kate PERFECT in thier characters, but the story line was an ""ALL EMOTION"" film. I have seen it twice and the second time was better than the first. This is the movie to BUY."
5,I JUST LOVE THIS MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I read the book and I just love it.I also love the movie very much.I can't wait till the movie comes out. Speaking of the movie and the book I went to a another website and found the Titanic script. I printed it out and I just love it!!! Everytime I read it I cry. Whoever did that I thank them. I also have to say that Kate Winslet and Leonardo Di Caprio were the perfect roles for Jack and Rose!!!!!!
3,Ed Wood \ Only for the Collector,"Ed Wood was the worst film producer of all time. His film, ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"" has been given the title of ""Worst Film Ever Made."" Ed was a transvestite so he worn angora sweaters and other women's clothes, and you see this in some of the films.Although many classic films have been reworked and are in pristine condition, what you see is what you get here. They were a hoot and terrible to begin with. There is in the box a DVD on Dolores Fuller and others of Wood's gang gathering for an Ed Wood Showing. How they all ended up being and looking like is so interesting. Dolores lived with Ed and finally got enough of him and moved on. She became a song writer and wrote some of Elvis' lesser known songs. And she still looks good!I just loved this collection and got a laugh out of all of it. This is a collection only for those interested in early film making, and as part of film history."
3,"Hey, it's Ed Wood.","Movies that are so bad, they are good. That's Ed Wood for you. The documentary about him had some good information but it was slow and repetitive."
1,kill your cr*p compilation,"Don't go near this misleadingly titled (many of the tracks were *not* singles) sloppily put together (no Grey Cell Green?!) disc which was put out by S**y with zero input from the band.Instead, buy the excellent Ned-endorsedSome Furtive Years: A Ned's Anthologybest-of collection which was released this year (2007). Then pick up all three studio albums;God Fodder,Are You Normal?andBrainbloodvolumeon Amazon Marketplace for less than $10 including shipping and check eBay for cheap used copies of their early singles round-up, Bite.If you still haven't had enough Ned's after that, check out their MySpace (search ""music"" for ""Neds Atomic Dustbin"" - make sure you type ""Neds"" and not ""Ned's"" otherwise you'll upset the MySpazz search engine) for details of their recent single Hibernation and news of upcoming live dates worldwide."
3,A decent story with some charm,"After reading this book I realized two things. I still like Mrs. Smith's books and the book was not quite wrapped up. The usual attention to detail is present in this story as it is in all of Smith's books. The families portrayed have a large number of problems-and were not all resolved after 446 pages. I know the limitations of character development in a medium size book, but I wish Smith had taken this into account while writing. On the other hand, not all issues in life are resolved. Despite this one complaint I enjoyed the book a lot. The humor is not heavy-handed and did cause me to smile many times and laugh aloud a few more. ... I would prefer this book get 3 1/2 stars instead of 3. The book is worth reading if you are looking for something light and cute."
4,Good basic idea book,"This is a good idea book. Their ""stuff of life"" is a little more attractive than mine (and most likely yours also), but the ideas are still useful. Don't expect this to be a book to showcase what most regular homes look like. All-in-all, this is a solid buy."
2,"Hey, Look How Straight My Stuff Is Stacked!","I was in need of serious clutter management, but instead, I got plenty of glossy photos, showing off their plates, china, etc., in addition to many ""Shabby Chic"" display set ups. It didn't have any examples I found usable in my ""real"" situation."
2,DON'T MIX--SPRING FOR THE CC NEW ORLEANS BLEND,"I was in NO a few weeks ago at Zuppardos on Vets looking for New Orleans Blend Community Coffee. They had it but it was pricey at $7.00 for a 16 oz bag. The CDM dark roast with chicory was going for half as much for a 13.5 oz bag. So I thought I would save some money by loading up on CDM. Bought 30 bags. The CDM was not good, with an extremely bitter taste. Well now I'm in Dallas with 29 bags of coffee I don't like. What to do? I decided to ""water it down"" a bit by mixing one bag of the CDM with an equal amount of Folgers. That didn't work either as the bitterness still came though. Moral of the story: Stick with New Orleans Blend Community Coffee with chickory. It's the only way to go . . . I gave the remaining CDM to a local food drive."
5,BAD Case Design (Stacked Discs),Love the show but what IDI*T designed the case and decided to Stack the Discs on top of each other so they will get scratched over time.Is it too hard to ask for a normal case that doesn't stack discs on top of each other?
1,Not bad book with one major flaw,"Much of the book is nicely done. The illustrations are most agreeable. The proofs, thoughnot quite on the level of selected proofs one finds in Wm. Dunham's ""Journey through Genius""(available from Amazon), are OK. Not totally splendid, but OK, given the intended audience.What torpedos the little volume is the regrettable inanities on page 46, ""Possible Impossibilities"".What an unfortunate set of assertions! At least to me. So disturbing that there is no way I canplace this slim volume next to my four excellent Dunham books (all purchased from Amazon.All reviewed by me elsewhere.)I am returning the book to Amazon.Naf Los Altos CA"
5,Flashback to the past!,I was SO excited to find this on the Amazon instant video marketplace. I watched this show when I was younger and I bought this season for my kids to watch the week of Halloween. Oh they were totally creeped out and wanted to watch more. (but not in the dark!)
5,My mommy read it,My mom had always told me on how this book was her favorite growing up. But her copy of it had disapered during the years. I read this book in 5th grade and remember my mom telling me that was the book she had loved when she was little. So as you can see it is a great book that can be passed down for generations.
2,Material not up to standard,I purchased this Donna Sharp Sunset Boulevard Lori Tote Quilted Handbag Purse by Quilts by Donna and was very disappointed in the quality of the workmanship and the material in which it was made. I have other Donna Sharp quilted handbags and this was definitely did not meet the standards of other bags I have purchased.
5,Warning! Linda Howard is Addictive,"This was the first Linda Howard book I read, and it was sooooo good, it sent me combing through used book stores and garage sales looking for her out of print books. This was also the book that introduced me to paperback romances, and began my search for other authors as good as Howard (alas, there are very, very few). I'd always enjoyed romance, but had never ventured beyond Anya Seton, M.M. Kaye, the Bronte sisters, Jane Austin, Georgette Heyer, Margaret Mitchell, Jan Cox Speas, etc. Obviously, there was a finite number of these books, which led me to set aside assumption and try pulp fiction. I'm glad I did because some of it (like ""Midnight Rainbow"") is wonderful fun. Thank you, Miss Howard, for hours of pure reading pleasure. I just wish I could find several of your equals, or failing that, I wish you could write a bit faster."
1,Sloppy job on the Kindle for iPhone,"I downloaded this to my iPhone using the kindle app. Unfortunately, the last few sentences of many pages are obscured, so there is no way to follow Roosevelt's argument. Very sloppy job on the part of Amazon."
1,Incompetent Publisher,"I just wanted to note that I share the experience of the other reviewer, who pointed out that the content is repeated over and over. I don't think this is just a binding error; the page numbers are correct (increasing) for the entire speech, but the actual speech is only around 18 pages, and then repeats for around 100 page. This item has serious problems."
5,Great Book,I bought this book along with Graphic Guide to Frame Construction : Details for Builders and Designers (For Pros by Pros) (Spiral-bound) and this book is more for the do-it-yourselfer person than the other book. Plenty of color illusrtations to go along to help you. Graphic Guide to Frame Construction : Details for Builders and Designers (For Pros by Pros) is more geared for the professional.
1,"Drunk, or out of their minds?",I hate this cd. It sounds like he's smashing his guitar on his head. Dont waste your money. I prefer Blink 182 or Offspring.
2,Easy Gardner Sun Screen Snap Grommets,I was totally dissapointed in their holding ability. The grommets come apart easily especially when you applypressure by tightening or in a strong wind. I ended up trying to glue the ones that were coming apart. This seems to have helped.
3,Snap on gromments,Snap on grommets. I wanted an easy snap on grommet. It was not as easy as it sounded and wasn't as tight as I would have liked
1,Cheaply Made,Very poor quality the glass is very thin and cracks easy for the money they are asking you can get much better then this!!!
2,too small,"the material is good but it is actually a lot smaller than it looks and the pockets in the outside are definitilly to small, i can't even use half of them"
4,Great patrol bag.,"This is a well constructed bag. It has enough room for just about anything you want to pack from extra flashlights, cuffs, magazines, food, water, medical supplies, pens, manuals etc. There are plenty of outside pockets for things you need daily, and the inside has dividers to help keep things in order. The zippers are heavy duty, and have lasted well. Best one for the money IMHO."
5,Using as a range bag,"We use ours as range bags (we bought two) and they work fine. There is plenty of room for clips, cleaning supplies, boxes of ammo, and protective gear. The construction is quite durable. This would make an okay bug out bag, if you can't find a suitable backpack."
5,sometimes the old ways are the best!,"These curlers are FANTASTIC for those of us who still love to use the old-fashioned foam hair curlers -- especially because they sell the individual sizes by the bag, so you don't get stuck with curler sizes you'll never use (usually, companies sell foam rollers by the bag -- of mixed sizes). It's great to know I can find these curlers here because most people now seem to be selling heated curlers or curling irons instead & my hair is too delicate for regular applications of high heat. Thanks for carrying them!"
5,Funny how time slips away,"This is a fine album..Willie Nelson and Ray Price together are fabulous..'Funny how time slips away' is great but there is also 'Release Me' and Crazy Arms'so how can you miss when you buy this one ? I am a true Ray Price fan but Willie Nelson is great too,I really like this album."
3,Alinsky,"not an easy read, but applicable of depicting what the Obama admin is pyramid building today. This is there Tower of Babel."
1,"The ""Communist Manifesto"" for Liberals","This has been the playbook for Liberals for the last two decades. It is the bible for the Obama Administration. You need to read this book and it will open your eyes to the Liberal's tactics. You will be able to see how Liberal's think and why they cannot or will not be involved in civilized open and honest debate. Rules for Radicals promotes and anti-American agenda, in that its objective is to silence open debate with your opponent, this is clearly not what our forefathers wanted."
1,Total destruction of the US,"If Americans take seriously what Alinsky wrote, they will be responsible for the total destruction of the US as we know it. He was a socialist, a progressive, a hater of the US constitution. Obama today is ruling according to Alinsky's dictates. That means tyranny! I recommend that no one read this piece of trash."
1,...,"Barbara Olson, in her book on Hillary Clinton, claims that Hillary was a disciple of Alinsky's and used methods from his book, the consequence of which has been the massive corruption that defines the Clinton administration."
2,An alternate view of America from the founders,"Alinsky fancies himself the 20th century radical cut out of the same cloth as the 18th century founders of the country. He is wrong. The third of his dedication quotes, speaking for Lucifer, best captures the essence of the book - a post-modern version of ""the ends justify the means"". This is cut out of the same cloth as ""The Prince"" by Machiavelli. Both books lack an ethical foundation. However, this should be read for an understanding of the thinking of the new left in religion and politics."
5,a must-read for those challenging the status quo,"I won't go so far as to say that what you can't learn about organizing and about standing up to the powerful from this book isn't worth knowing, but Saul Alinsky has penned a book that contains nearly all of what you need to know.How effective was Alinsky? Forty years after his death, the Right still foams at the mouth when they spit out his name, demonstrating the depths of their fear and hatred. When they're using your name as invective, that's proof positive that you've succeeded."
3,This is the liberal playbook,"There is no doubt that Mr. Alinsky is a brilliant man and a great writer, the problem is, he is evil personified. When I read this book it actually scared me that people in America think this way much less occupy the White House and the halls of Congress.Every so often you hear the term ""liberal playbook"" and this is it. Alinsky explains in great detail about how to polarize a topic or a person. I highly recommend that all conservative activists and politicians read this book so that you have an idea of how to combat the liberal machine."
1,Rules For Radicals or Rants for Radicals?,"I picked this up at the local book store because I refuse to buy it,to get more intel on what is the big deal and apparently nothing, A Very Angry Leftist Elite,He criticizes communism once but goes on and on about The Haves and the Have-Not's and what ""Change"" can bring from within?He opposes The Weatherman and loons such as them yet He is still a Loon. I read it and it's all the oppression talk and self-righteous liberal talk wanting handouts and Even Quoting Democracy in America, But the problem with the Left and more the Radical Left is they are a Tiny Minority who will sell their souls just to impose on the rest of the population a Utopia that never has and never will EXIST.the Faster the Washed up 60s Radicals and the New New (Modern/Obama/Bubba/Hillary)Left realize this and conform to their lofty San Francisco Or NYC Or Campus Rooms the better the world will be. Liberalism is the Opiate of the Masses."
1,Obama Playbook and The Making of a Community Organizer,"What is a Community Organizer?The first time I heard of this title was when people were describing candidate Obama's resume. It didn't sound very impressive, but it did not sound threatening either.Read this book and you will know completely what a community organizer/organizing is.Saul Alinksy is considered the father of Community Organizing and this book describes his methods and tactics.Although I vehemently disagreed with Alinsky's teachings, I highly recommend this book for anyone who is interested in understanding the operating rationale behind such entities as the Obama Administration, ACORN, SEIU, unions, the Left, and the Mainstream Media."
5,MacCase is MacPerfect!,"I've spent lots of money and wasted plenty of time searching for the perfect bag to meet my needs. The MacCase is it! The sleeve for my Macbook offers plenty of protection and is not bulky. The size of the bag itself allows me to carry my Macbook, along with all the necessities from my purse, allowing me one less bag when flying. The bright lime green interior does in fact make it easier to find items in the bag. I really appreciate the side pocket for my Nano and the small opening for my earbuds.There are enough pockets in this bag for me to keep my Macbook accessories separate from my purse contents. I LOVE the fact that I can travel with one less bag!!"
1,iSee 360i,software must be too old for systems like W Vista--iTune up dates will not allow use of software Edition 1.7 May 4 2006--Oh!! *ell! Buyer(s) beware--
1,COMPATABILITY,PRODUCT IS NOT COMPATABLE WITH VIDEO IPODS. THAT IS THE TARGET MARKET. SHOULD NOT BE SOLD.
2,Don't buy the kindle Edition,"The content of the book looks very good. However, the visual quality of images and charts leave much to be desired in the Kindle version. Sections of the nautical charts are illegible due to compression artifacts on the images. Even viewing them on a 28"" monitor doesn't help. It's a shame since guide books could benefit greatly from ebook formats if done correctly."
2,Ends of jack can be damaged by aggressive chewer,"My 35 lb. springer spaniel mix is a brutally aggressive chewer. She quickly tore very small pieces off the ends of the jack legs. But the damaged area only extends one half inch or so from the tips of the jack's legs. Neither of my dogs seems particularly interested in the toy, but they will occasionally chew on it if I involve the toy in a game."
1,My bad,"While this is a fine wreath, I didn't realize it needs to be plugged in. I had somehow thought it was battery operated."
2,But where is the thing I want to know????,"I love reference books and I had an editing job that required me to have ""15"" so I had the perfect excuse to buy it. But what a difficult book to use. I checked a few relatively easy things, and one or two obscure things. If the answer wasn't where I logically expected it, the book directed me elsewhere, to an elsewhere so difficult to find that I wasted prescious time. It sure looks good, but...."
5,The Gold Standard,"The Chicago Manual of Style is the gold standard in books for writers,editors and proofreaders. It's well-organized, comprehensive, and easy to use. I bought this 15th Edition to update my 12th Edition, which I had been using for over twenty years."
4,"Actually, it's readable.","I was surprised to find out that this book is actually quite readable, not just a look-it-up reference for editors and writers. The amount of information in this thing is astounding."
4,"Fantastic ""Album""","I originally owned this on cassette in 1985. Steinman had been responsible for Meat Loaf's ""Bat Out of Hell"" as producer and songwriter. On ""Bad For Good"" he sings/growls/screams/performs his own songs (many of which ended up on ""Bat Out of Hell II""). Steinman's producing style is very distinct. For fans his style is unmistakeable. From Air Supply to Bonnie Tyler, he's helped them create some very memorable songs. On his own album, it's timeless. Although originally released in 1981, the entire album is listenable from beginning to end. Backed up with the talent of Todd Rungren and Ellen Foley, Steinman's ""Bad For Good"" is a welcomed addition to any CD collection."
3,Good songs with bad vocals!,If meat sang on this album i'd give it 5 stars.Stienman is a writer not a singer.
4,The Little CD Player That Could,"I really like this product. It doesn't take up much shelf space and can even be hung on the wall. The speakers can be detached. The sound quality is very, very good. Since I only listen to one CD at a time, it's adequate for me...in fact, I got rid of a large, 5-disk player for this one."
2,not so good,I own two of these. One stays filled the other does not-my niece slept on it and ended up on the floor.I cannot recommend this product.
3,will wait and see,"I just recieved my airbed today so I can not say how it will sleep. But it is not the size it is advertised to be. It is 36 inches wide and 65 inches long. Regular sized sheets fit? Not hardly!!!!!!!!!! Like I say, will wait and see."
4,From the Back Cover,"Time Magazine's Review from the back cover:""Some people find it incredible that their otherwise intelligent friends can believe in a God, a Virgin Birth or the Resurrection of Christ. Others find it incredible that their otherwise intelligent friends can deny the existence of a Creator and fail to see the Bible as divine revelation. In a new book called Atheism in Our Time, Father Ignace Lepp, 53, who goes on the assumption that 'neither belief nor unbelief can be adequately explained by bad faith,' undertakes to define the varieties of modern unbelief."""
2,Sounds like a good idea,"These seem to work really well unless you happen to be using a wireless network router. The unit snaps, crackles and pops and generally gives a poor picture quality. I've tried all the four channels without any relief."
2,Book fits in the Palm of your hand,I did not realize this book was so small. I am glad it did not cost much however because of the size it takes away from the bargin
2,Did this come out of cracker jack?,"Loved the story, my students think it is a hoot! But it is tiny, looks like it could have come out of a cracker jack box. Better off to buy from school bookfair to get regular sized book."
3,Disappointed,"Although the contents & illustrations of the book were enjoyed by my granddaughter, you needed a magnifying glass to read the darned thing! The book is only about three inches square and that is NOT in the product description. I probably should have suspected something because of the low cost of the book. Again, when I could finally find my reading glasses to read it, the contents were quite enjoyable!"
4,inside of wolf tower,"This book keeps you on the edge of your seat, or couch for some of you. What Claidi thinks is her dream prince turns out to be not what she expected. another man comes into her journey who keeps a loving eye on her, who she choses... or what happens is for you to discover"
3,it's a great book but . . .,i'm still readiing the book i think would of been better if she made a different deccion but it will probably make up 4 it in the end it'sa great book i just dont like the choice she made
2,You can hear screams for remastering!,"A masterpiece of a CD -- if you can use that word for a compilation -- in some ways. This collection, while rather skimpy and sorely needing of remastering, is one of my favorite discs of all time.Taj Mahal is a bluesman to be sure, but his stuff is infected with reggae (Johnny Too Bad), calypso and other wonderful sounds of the islands. He is the happiest man in show business -- this really comes through in his later records and in live performances.While there are other places to start with Taj's catalog, this CD is very near and dear to my heart. Probably because of ""Fishin' Blues"" and ""Ain't Gwine ..."" -- two of his finest works. I would recommend this CD if you're looking for an inexpensive way to get a flavor for some early Taj Mahal. But given that there are only ten tracks of poor sound quality, my recommendation is of a personal and sentimental nature."
1,Horrible,"Bought this for my 5 yr old so she could brush her teeth, the thing broke within a week of buying it."
3,Encouraging and hopeful,this book helps you see the bigger picture. It brings the reality of disease up for review. You are not alone and this book proves it.
3,"Stays Cold a Long Time, But Product Doesn't Last","The technology used to keep these packs cold is really great--stays pliable and last a really long time.But I've owned four of these packs and none of them have lasted more than a year. (And company didn't respond to my requests for replacement.) The place I need to ice involves leaning back against the pack and this is too much for the seams, which pop over time..."
3,I was really disappointed with this Audio Book,Perhaps I have read too much of Abraham and expected more than some people would from this book. I found a couple of good ideas here but it was short and not that informative in my estimation. I would not recommend it for anyone who has studied the law of attraction at any length. I would not buy it again.
4,Exactly what I expected,"This product was exactly as expected. I love Paul Michell Feeze and Shine, and the flexible shine verion of the product as well. I switch between the two all the time. I was concerned this might be a watered down version of the product but upon trying it find it to be performing as expected. I am so glad to have an online source for this. It's hard to get in my area at times."
2,not what I recalled,"I must've been mistaken about this band, because I recalled hearing something beautiful from them. But this was a dud. Nice cover though."
4,A Very Good Album,"This album is probably the only Case album worth picking up. I absolutely love this one because it has some r&b gems on it. Check out ""love of my life,"" ""even though,"" and ""conversate"" (even though conversate is not an actual word - the correct term would be converse). This music is not for the immature or people just wanting to hear some music. In order to appreciate this album, you have to have been through some things in relationships. You have to have to be able to understand where he is coming from in order to apprecaite the seemingly simple lyrics of most of the songs. Case is not your plain old R&B singer...he sings love songs. If you don't like love songs, then this album may not be for you. Otherwise, you can put this album up there with Brian McKnight and Javier."
3,brief review Painless Grammar,"Interesting but not well organized.Hard to tell where the author is going.Would like to see an overall plan.Need tabulated sets of basic elements by function.How do the elements produce a ""grammar"".Would also would have liked to see some semblanceof sentence diagraming.retired aero space engineer-chuck"
2,Handles are on backwards!,"We bought the Garden Claw several years ago at our first house and never used it, because the handles are mounted for lefties. That is, the two hand-grips are each curved to the side, giving a feel of turning a wheel when you use it. This would be great if you put your hands on the grips and turned it to the right to dig. But the tines on this gadget are positioned so that you have to ""steer"" the Claw to the left to get them to dig. Since us righties have more strength in our right hands, it was very awkward to ""steer"" the Claw to the left. We spent about 20 minutes with it in the garden that day and haven't used it since."
2,"Not good for hard soil, soil with a lot of roots or rocks",I bought this baby because I have hard soil with clay in it. So I thought I would try to airate it and soften it up with this garden weasel and then mix it with some baught soil. This tool isn't any good for anything other then soft soils that need to be shaken up a bit. It is handy and more comfortable to break that type of soil or if you have a few small pebbles though it has to be pretty soft soil to begin with and not ridden with roots or rocks. Otherwise I hope your strong and have a lot of will power if you still want to buy this.
5,best weeder/cultivator I've ever used!,This is absolutley the best weeder/cultivator I've ever used and I've tried them ALL!!! I'm pretty intense about weeding my flower/shrub beds and keeping them looking nice and the soil soft around them. I have 6 acres to maintain and most areas have beds. This little gadget made a 2-3 hr job of weeding just one flower bed to about 20-30 minutes even if I let it go till the weeds are getting out of hand. I'm a middle aged female and didn't have to exert any extraordinary effort. There's a bit of a learning curve (took maybe 4-5 tries) and then you're off to the races. It even pulls the weeds up for you!
4,So far so good!,"Bought this for my husband to use, I hate gardening. He hasn't complained yet. I think he likes it so far and it seems to work great for weeds, etc."
5,Very comfortable. Good for travel or every night.,"I have been looking for a good orthopedic travel pillow. I bought the Wal-Pil-O Travel size, which is a very comfortable pillow, but it is so big that it takes up my entire overnight bag. After searching on the internet for an inflatable orthopedic travel pillow, I found the Sleepmatterzzz Dual-Valve Pillow. It fits in my carry-on bag with room to spare for all my other overnight things. Best of all, it is easy to inflate and a dream to sleep on. Although I bought this for travel, I would recommend it also for every day (every ""night"") use."
5,Made the awful commute to work wonderful!,Nice variety of sounds. Something different but still very enjoyable for us old timers. Liked it so much I even recommended it to my boss!
2,Andrea Chenier/Mario Del Monaco,"The voices are beautiful, but the image is from an old kinescope in black and white. Only for the cognoscenti who want the essence of the beautiful singing."
4,Challenging Game,"This game is challenging and almost to the point of frustration at times. But really, they did a fantastic job in getting me engrossed in the game.Pros: Puzzles are challenging but if you follow your gut you will perservere. I had to read a lot for this game. Although this will sound nuts, I felt smarter after playing this game.It got me addicted. I went through stages: from Addiction to Intrigue and then to anticipation of wanting to beat it.Cons: I was hoping for more of a scary feel. At times you may feel a little creeped out, but nothing more. A few (4 out of 38 or more)puzzles did frustrate me.Tip: Buy the game if you like detective work (the constant studying and keeping your mind open) and you like forensics (not the study of dead people but the pragmatic approach of seeing the result and looking everywhere for the cause), if you like details.Look for hints and beware of forums that don't hide spoilers. The game is much more fun when you don't cheat."
5,LOVE IT!!!,I had the tape when it 1st came out.Regret not buying the cd.Love all the songs from beginning to end.these songs have been a blessing in my life.My tape is now about had its last run through.And now found the cd.Can't wait to get it at home.I highly recommend it.
5,AWESOME CD!!!!!!!,"This is one of the VERY BEST worship CD's I have EVER heard, and I have over 100 cd's! Even the fast songs have so much peace in them, and it just brings you right into the presence of God!"
2,"A Boring, Plotless, Black and White Chat Fest.","This film is in black and white, which surprised me. It had a very confusing intro. like a situation comedy, where the film immediately opens to a 3-4 minute scene before any opening credits--only the scene feels like you're suddenly watching the middle of a movie. It seemed out of place. Then the credits started and I was relieved that neither my computer nor Amazon was messing up after all. With the introduction of the first 2 lead characters, the writing and acting seemed engaging. However, I started to get bored when these characters ended up at a restaurant, where the 3rd lead was introduced. Thereafter, I thought the writing and storyline quickly fell apart to the point that I stopped watching altogether after the 3 lead characters ended-up unearthing a time-capsule and fled to a gym. I had had enough."
5,one of the best albums ever!!,"Triumph, along with Destiny are the best albums by the Jacksons! There's not a single bad track on this album, the singing, songwriting, melodies and harmonies, and production is superb, and it's truly a timeless classic that deserves more recognition."
3,Hard to get into,"Phar - Lap is one of my favorite racehorses, but I have to agree with some of the other people on here.....It is hard to get into. Not very well written. have to force myself to read it."
4,Good Book on Pharlap,"The book was excellent reading about the wonderful Pharlap, but I had wished it had gotten more into the personal details then with the racing stats. The writers shed great detail into the true cause of Pharlap's death. Pharlap was one of a kind and all horse lovers should absolutely read this book."
3,Authors attempting to end series with actual second coming,"It seems to me that the authors are doing everything that they can to stretch out this series. The last few books I was able to read in about two sittings, and that was disappointing. It seems to be that the authors are... a.) attempting to time events in the book with the potential second coming, b.) try to hold off finishing because they don't know how to finish the story, or c.) as someone else also stated, they're trying to turn this into an even bigger cashcow.Regarding this book I think the page count has gone down or at least the margins have gotten bigger and the text bigger making the book have much less content.I am rating this book a three because if you started to read this series you have to keep reading it...there will not be anything in this book that will make you say ""wow"" however."
1,"Read ""End Times Fiction"" instead","Readers of the ""Left Behind Series"" are advised to read Gary DeMar's book ""End Times Fiction"". I am not qualified as a theologian, but DeMar's book makes more sense to me than do the Left Behind books. The Bible does not contain or support virtually any of Lahaye's theories of the last days. In fact, the last days have already happened. Premillenial dispensationalism (as per Lahaye and Jenkins) has only been written since the 1850's and is not scriptural or even the position of the historic church. If you believe what you read in the Bible (including Revelation), you will see that these authors do not find support for their positions there. I just wonder how many of the readers of these books have read the relevant scriptures for themselves."
3,PART OF THE LEFT BEHIND SERIES,"This is one of the books in the Left Behind Series. Similar to all the others. Fortunately is a story in itself, so if you don't get the whole series you can still get a good read."
4,Another good book,"As I said in the previous reviews of all the books that I have bought, of the ""Left Behind"" series, which is well over 15.They were all for my granddaughter, who is in her ""twenties"", and she's read them all.I am not an avid reader, so I don't know about them personally.I take her word for it, that they are GOOD !!"
3,Zero to Sixty,"The book started off as all of the other ones do buy giving history and going in to detail about what is going on and who is thinking what, but when I got to the last couple of chapters it ""spead up."" When I came to the last page I was like ""is this really the end of the book?"" Don't get me wrong, there were places in the book where I was in suspense and my heart was pounding, but it seemed like they (LaHaye and Jenkins) rushed the last couple of chapters to fit it in the book. I have come this far and won't quit until the end of the series though."
4,Couldn't Put it Down,"After waiting a year for this book, I sat up all night and read from cover to cover. I just couldn't put it down! The authors really know God's word and how to write a realistic story. I'll have to read the entire series again, just before the next book is published."
1,The Remnant: On the Brink of Armageddon (Left Behind No. 10),The Left Behind Series are written for those who are focused on LaHaye's preconceived ideas of end time events and not what the Holy Bible teaches in Daniel and Revelation.
2,I was left behind!,"I must admit I was very much disappointed in not only this book but the last two! The series began with such a bang - holding your interest page after page. Now... sadly, the writers have choosen to drag the story out in an effort to simply make more money. I am so disappointed with them that I doubt I will read the next book... Honestly - they could have summed this up 2 books ago!"
3,I can't believe these books are still getting 5 stars,I am so bogged down with this series it has taken forever to get this far and I hope as i've said before that I finish these books before Jesus comes back. I'm sick of Chloe who should be at home taking care of her child instead of running around impersonating GC. And I'm just about tired of everyone else too. The ones you want to stay end up getting killed off and the were left with only the Trib Force. whatever.
3,NOT VERY HAPPY,"I WAS NOT TO HAPPY WITH THIS BOOK IT DID NOT HAVE THE FEELING OF THE FIRST BOOKS AND THE EXCITEMENT WAS NOT THERE, BUT INSPITE OF IT I THINK THE BOOK WAS OKAY AND I WILL BE WAITING ON THE NEXT ONE..."
5,awesome,love the series left behind. the cd's allow me to have friends and co-workers who aren't readers here the story of Revelations.
5,Conrbituions of the Hapsburg Monarchy to the Social Fabric of Austria,"'The Austrian Mind' is the first book in English or in German to analyze both in depth and in breadth the intellectual history of the Hapsburg Monarchy between 1848 and 1938. Based upon an impressive command of primary and secondary published sources, Johnston's book is a tour de force.In 400 pages of text the author evaluates the contributions of Austro-Hungarian intellectuals to economic, legal, and social theory, to the arts, to philosophy, to literature and criticism, and to medicine."
2,so-so,This remote did not work with all of our components. It limited the capabilities of our cable television DVR and only worked with our surround sound system a few times. It was difficult to program. I gave it to a friend with only a TV and DVD player and bought myself another brand that works great.
4,"One of the best remotes on the market, but...","This is a great remote, but the software that comes with it is some of the worst I have ever seen published by an international company.Be SURE to download version 1.1 of the software as the remote still ships with 1.0. It is slightly less painful to use.[...]"
4,I'm so glad...,"I sat there in front of the TV back when the show was on everyday and I taped all of the episodes on VHS. I paused out commercials and I made my own Beavis & Butthead volumes...and I have all of those episodes that have been left out by Time Life and Mike Judge.Almost all of those are classic, hilarious episodes....""Beard Boys"" was histerical.... ""would ya like to stroke my beard?"" some of the onliners in these episodes is hilarious....I agree with the previous person's account of Mike Judge.....let us decide whether or not the early episodes are crap or not...some of the real early ones are pure classic...like the one when they go to the carnival and get whacked on the pavement by that big gorilla type bodyguard... LOL!!Just release all the episodes Judge.....people WILL buy them....in the meantime, I'm glad I taped all of those episodes...so i can watch all the ones that arent included...I'm still gonna buy these dvds..I have Vol 1..."
5,a must read,"it is a good book and for its size, 30 something pages of actual content, it is very enlightening and contains surprising amount of information in its small size. it is a must read for any and all Gandhi followers, critics, or anyone looking for information about his non-violent ways."
1,Worthless,"I was interested in looking into some of the more controversial parts of the Gandhi legend. This small booklet does not approach them at all. It's format is that of a seemingly off-the-cuff talk delivered at some conference; the approach is totallyGandhi conventional wisdom: i mean innocuous. As a ""bonus"", there's an explanation in the back of the booklet on how to properly line break the name ""Gandhi"" - that is, where to divide a 2 syllable personal name so you can continue the text on whatever page. I think that sort of indicates the educational value of this booklet.Might have worked as high school freshman's report. In the open marketplace of ideas it's a total waste."
3,New perspectives,"Great man and insight into his approach to political change. Book explained his approach, but ended by saying his ideas won t work in most current situations with no explanation of why it will not work...just casually dismisses conglomeration and civil disobedience."
2,Basic story there but could've been developed more.,"""Midnight Radio"" has a good premise--a radio station being haunted. And the author made some good choices relating to the characters, namely that the main one, Ryan Knox, is suffering from real problems in the midst of encountering this haunting.The only problem is that the author misses some key instances where the story could've been developed a bit more. Ryan's wife is only minimally developed, so that I'm on the verge of caring about her loss, but am not quite there. Perhaps some flashbacks with dialog would've helped. There's also a scene where Ryan's doing an aside to the reader about a co-worker, Dave, and how he introduces him to his wife. Personally, I think doing this totally spoils the surprise when we encounter the woman later in the story.It's a decent book, but it's definitely not best seller material."
4,Nutcracker Complete,"It was one of the best cd's of The Nutcracker ballet I have ever heard.I used it in my show.It is a hit.I you want a goooood Nutcracker cd,get this one,it is the best."
2,Let's Express Our Pain With Naughty Words,"There were some truly moving poems/prose in this book, but for the most part, the vulgarity seems forced and used strictly for sensationalism. Like maybe no one would listen if she weren't causing a stir with foul language. Performance art just doesn't seem to translate well onto paper."
3,An idea builder,"Good graphics/GUI idea builder, but no longer on the cutting edge of technology... needs updating"
2,Fails on the central questions,"What is science? What is the scientific method? What is a scientific theory? At what point does an idea merit acceptance as a theory? The author ignores these issues.Is the scientific community engaged in an atheist conspiracy to suppress ID? Are scientists censoring their work for fear of being criticized? Proponents of ID must think so, for there is overwhelming consensus among scientists that ID does not qualify as a theory, or even come close.We use words like infinite and forever as if we understand them, and yet they represent something that is incomprehensible and humbling. ID and literal minded theism are reactions to this reality, but are not prerequisites for religious faith."
4,Great action flick,"As a long time fan of Japanese Martial Arts flicks and Anime, I found Zatoichi entertaining. The ""filler"" was entertaining. I did not feel the film dragged at all, and it kept me pretty well entertained. Hardly used the FF button at all. Until the end. What was with the extended village wide Taiko Drums dance fest? Kodo does a better job - why dedicate the final 15 minutes or so to it? Picture ""Empire Stripes Back"" - the stupid Ewock singing at the end. Now make it an Ewock dance, drum, singing fest that lasts 15 endless minutes. Annoying it is. That's why this got 4 stars and not 5."
3,Only for die hard Zatoichi fans,If you are not already a big fan of the Zatoichi films absolutely do NOT purchase this film. This is modernized reload of the original films. I must admit that I enjoy the original films much better than this updated version.
2,Weak effort,"I was expecting so much more after reading the reviews here.Although I am a big fan of the original series, I believe that I would have still been disappointed by this movie even if I had never seen the originals. The special effects were of poor quaility, the sword fighting by Zatoichi was mediocre and the story was nothing special. In addtion, his silly hair color was distracting and he had no personality. Perhaps the actor was attempting to make the character different from the original, but still, he was not interesting to watch.I really wanted to like this film, but at every turn I felt let down.One positive was the scenery and the setting for the scenes which did not feel fake like many Hollywood films."
4,A Landscaper's Friend,"The Weed Eater XT 114 14"" electric trimmer is one of the best performers in its class. After perusing the gardening isle with my husband, we were looking for 4 traits in a ""weedeater"".1. Price 2. Reliability 3. Warranty 4. AmpageWith a price tage under $40, a 2 yr. limited warranty and the name brand ""Weed Eater"", we narrowed the search to this tool and another generic brand. Both were in the price and warranty range; however the Weed Eater had an automatic rewind button, was more lightweight and had a more powerful motor.Our choice was easily made; Weed Eater was the trimmer for us!"
4,Great trimmer for the money,"Purchased to replace an older model.Pros:* Weighs much less then older model* Adjustable height* Motor is very powerfulCons:* Construction seems a little flimsy, but time will tellSummation:Very happy with the purchase and would recommend this trimmer."
4,Women in American - historical fiction,"Wonderful story, well-written. Anyone interested in the suffragette movement, labor organizing, or the immigrant experience in turn of the century New York will enjoy this book very much. Highly recommended"
2,Cheep,"These look great in a picture. Priced right @ (2 Pairs)for 3.23 w/ shipping. My problem with these plug are that I'm using 14 gauge wire. I had to bend the ends of the wire over to make it thick enough for the screw to hold the wire. and the end that holds the screw is vary thin, And the screw strips out easily. I will not buy these again. CHEEP is an understatement. Worth-less then there charging."
3,Close call,I was actually going to give this a one star.....I was midway through the last episode and was just about to call it quits on the series but decided to see it through....the ending made up for all the anger I was feeling up to that point....the storyline kinda goes in a circle but it does come to an acceptable conclusion
4,The White House Cookbook,"This is a wonderful book which my mother gave to me when I was a new bride. I just purchased this as a gift, as it is full of fantastic recipes."
5,VERY GOOD,"Didn't have problem with the order and the book was selected as a text book for my school and it is very rich, worth reading."
3,Good details,"I read this book for part of my Master's Degree in International Relations: Asian Studies...I felt it was informative but DRY at times. I guess that is a common thread with all text books. For a basic understanding of Buddhism, this is a good place to start, but I could also recommend a book call ""Buddha"" by Karen Armstrong...it is a little less ""technical"" and a bit easier to read than this book..."
4,two-for-one = good deal,"This is a repackaging of two classic (and hard to find) earlier ""albums"" by Flora and Airto: 1986's ""The Magicians"" and 1989's ""The Sun Is Out."" Both of these titles are excellent, especially as a ""twofer"" deal."
1,One sided fiasco,I've not much to say except I'll never read another of Leckie's books. From the get go Robert introduces us to his obvious religious biases. I believe he thinks that the Pope himself should reign sovreign. Do your homework Leckie!
1,Drivel,"What a terrific letdown. Having been eager for information on the French and Indian War, I decided to purchase this book without first learning a bit about the author. Live and learn. Leckie is chauvanistic, pedantic, outrageously opinionated, and boring. Fans of Chuck Norris will likely find A Few Acres of Snow entertaining and philosophically reinforcing. I now understand how this author can be so prolific -- all the information he requires is between his ears."
4,Intriguing and captivating,"I was drawn to this book because I enjoy learning about the colonization of America and I find that most history books remind me too much of college textbooks. They contain straight facts and are dull reading material. This book on the other hand almost makes one feel as though they are part of the historical events. The author adds embellishments, which, whether factual or not, keep one's interest in the story. The author does tend to jump forward along the historical timeline and leaves no explanations for the gaps, but the interesting details of all the events is enough for the reader to overlook the gaps in the storyline. I look forward to reading more books by this author.Unfortunately, most of the books I read these days have obvious mistakes that cause me to wonder if an editor's job is one of overwork or under pay so I was able to overlook the mistakes in yet another book."
4,Including students with special needs,This book is a great resource for including students with special needs into a regular education environment. The book offers great suggestions from activities to how to set up your classroom. This book also addresses the needs of parents of children with special needs. This is a must have resource for educators.
1,never received,I would love to review this book--because it is the textbook for a graduate class that I am taking; but I have never received it. I would be so grateful if this product could be sent to me. Thank you.
5,Totally enjoyable,I am a little embarrassed but not ashamed to admit that I'm a 28 year old fan. I read the first one in the series and then devoured the second and third the next day. Great!
4,The Perfect Golf Club,"Iam a moderately keen golfer who knew nothing about club design or capabilities but after reading this book I feel that I have much more confidence about my view of what features in a golf club would be more suitable for my golfing capabilities, my height and swing characteristicsThe author claims many years as a golfer with a start as a professional golf professional teacher then a clubmaker as such he gives a very good description of swing faults and cures that are far more technical and detailed than explanations provided in golf magazinesA recommendation is made to visit a professional clubmaker for advice, club modifications or new clubs as off the shelf clubs do not suite every individualPersonally I am persuaded to visit a clubmaker if I can find one in my locality"
4,"Simple, Basic Instruction","The book has the basics that you expect from a 'for Dummies' book. Nothing too elaborate, but enough to get you started on housetraining your puppy or older dog with potty issues."
1,Don't Buy It!,"I bought this and the audio sucks. It crackles and no matter what you do to try and fix it, it won't. As another review stated, the audio does not lock so that may be why it also crackles as it cannot stay in sync withe the video. I am throwing it away and buying the Canopus 110.For my MAC, I have used the El Gato USB 2.o capture device and it always works well, never a problem. The only thing about these cheaper devices is that they have no external control over the contrast, brightness, color, etc and you have to fix any issues in a software program like Final Cut or Adobe premiere.Also, don't buy the crappy EASY CAP, it should be called the EASY CRAP."
4,A Description,"From Back Cover:When Evelyn Allen was fished out of the East River at 2 a.m. her death was officially described: ""jumped or fell""; it seemed to be a routine case of a young pregnant woman taking her final way out. But within a short time Inspector Schmidt discovered a number of circumstances that led him to add, ""or was pushed."""
5,The Best Album Of All Time,I have anxiously been waiting to get this Cd. Barbara and Barry created sensational duets with this one. I remember growing up as a young girl and listening to the Guilty album. Thank you for having this item in stock. It brings back wonderful memories and I think everyone should buy this cd either as a gift or for yourself. Each song has a special message for anyone in love or looking for love. lol
3,Somewhat disappointed,"The DVD was interesting but the album was not up to Barbra or Barry's typical quality of songs, with a couple of exceptions"
5,Love it,"I just Love all the Four Play Cd's .They are soothing, relaxing and I truly enjoy them. I wish I could get some more for Christmas"
4,Can't do five stars- I'm just not that generous.,"One of the better jazz holiday CDs by one of the best jazz groups of recent years. Fourplay is Bob James, Larry Carlton, Nathan East and Harvey Mason (plus some session musicians). 'Amazing Grace' features Carlton's guitar virtuosity on display, which is smooth and steady and not overdone. Includes 'River' before it became a holiday staple. A must for smooth jazz fans."
5,"Amazing Album, and its helps a good cause","This is an amazing album. I'll be the first to admit that since I got napster, my CD buying habits have dropped. My Cd policy is now basically, that it better be damn good for me to buy it. This Album is well worth the money and 8stops7 are a great bunch of guys and they donate the money for the sale of the CD to ""Children of the Night."" That was the the straw that broke it for me, as soon as I found that out I had to buy the CD."
2,Latter part of cd mellows out,"The first half of this cd has some catchy, groove laden songs. Singer is similar to Eddie Vedder, but guitars are a lot heavier than Pearl Jam. I guess they forgot to turn on the distortion pedals for the second half of the cd. I was less than thrilled with that. Reading everyone else's review, they make it sound like this is the best debut cd that was ever recorded. You are certainly entitled to an opinion, but that is stretching it a little bit too much. It looks like my review is the first in a negative vein."
5,This album is tremendously uplifting.,"Janet Paschal has a style all her own. Each of the songs that she performs has a way of getting right into your heart. She seems to express in song exactly what you're feeling. Her love for her Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ, is obvious, and He most definitely uses her music to remind you of who He is. You can't go wrong by listening to any of her recordings."
2,Did Not Fit Sprayer,"Purchased with Stanley 61804N 4 Gallon Backpack Sprayer. Needed to extended reach for cleaning house siding, however the fittings on this telescoping wand would not fit. Also would not fit on my Roundup 1 gallon sprayer either. Not cost effective to send back. Hope to keep someone else from making the same mistake."
5,hose extention,It did everything I could expect. I would recommend this product to anyone that has trouble with their back due to bending over.
1,Gilmour Spray Telescoping Sprayer Wand,I ordered a Gilmour Spray Telescoping Sprayer Wand. I received the item but it does not thread on correctly. It is the exact same wand as the broken one that I am replacing. The package also did not contain any type of receit or packing slip so how would I ever be able to take the company up on their life time guarantee????
2,This album contains the best loverboy song of all,"This album was a landmark for rock and roll but only because it featured ""Turn Me Loose"". This song had a fresh sound that brought new life to album rock stations across the country. ""Turn Me Loose"" will always turn up on a classic rock station somewhere. This, Loverboy's first album, also contains ""The Kid is Hot Tonight"" but little else worth mentioning. Both hits off this album can be found on ""Big Ones"", a greatest hits compilation that is far superior to their debut effort. Loverboy still turns up on rock stations to this day because they knew how to write catchy tunes and rock a little more than some of the other bands of the 80's."
4,Lace,"Lace is a new trio in Canada just breaking through, they have very nice voices and have talent. From the fun I Want A Man to the reminiscent True Love (Never Goes Out Of Style) there is a variety of country music here, every song is distinct and unique in its own way. Give them a try, youll be surprised."
4,Anyone that speaks and writes English should have this...,"Since this dictionary is made and endorsed by Oxford University, you can't go wrong with this one! When I purchased this book, I was astounded by how heavy in weight it was. The information and definitions inside are comprehensive, concise, and in large black print that is accessible to read, however, I was disappointed in the fact that this dictionary is biased in respect to British grammar and usage as it focuses on American English. Nevertheless, every office and household should have a dictionary, and Oxford traditionally is the most widely accepted and famous reference provider in the world."
2,Poor Physical Quality,"I've never written a book review focusing on physical qualities rather than content, but it's relevant here. I'm an author and director of research at a think tank so rely heavily on my dictionary, thesaurus, and book of quotations. A dictionary needs to a hard working book. This is one is not going to be. The first time I opened it, the binding developed a two inch crack where it bends. I'm afraid I'll end up replacing this in short order, so can't recommend it."
2,Third Edition: Excellent Reference Book - Majorly Flawed!,"I love the layout of this dictionary! For its price, it can't be beat in my opinion. No - no colored pictures, but this is a dictionary, not an encyclopedia -- you use it to look for words. There is a bonus ""reference"" section at the end which has several uniquely American things like the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, and various other goodies. While this dictionary excels in every aspect I am concerned with over the American Heritage Dictionary, it has a major problem. The paper quality is horrible! Thinner than rice paper. Print bleeds from the other side of the page. My first edition did not have this problem, but this third edition has definitely cost-cut and for that reason, I cannot recommend you buy this edition."
1,Nope,The author spent too much time writing about his personal thoughts and not enough about his mission or the physical circumstances surrounding it and himself. Pass this one by...
5,A Train to Potevka,"Brilliant! It is difficult to believe that this is Mike's first book. As a frequent visitor to Russia myself, I was captivated by his knowledge of the Russian culture and character, but this is also a can't-put-down read because of the intrigue. It is amazing that the author survived his harrowing experiences there as an agent. He beautifully combines his personal ordeal with his compassion for the Russian people and his knowledge of a changing society. This is a best-seller for sure!"
5,I Highly Recommend This Book,"We started reading this book and couldn't put it down until we finished. It holds your attention from beginning to end, tells a great love story and the excitement of the escape. Ila has read it twice more since and thoroughly enjoyed it each time. He gives firesides and keeps everyone spellbound."
2,Track 11 Interrupted?!,"Just at the end, the track 11 is interrupted... strange, disappointing. I thought my downloading process had a problem so I downloaded the album again. I also tried with a couple of music players. You can actually see the problem visually if you open the track using Audacity ([...]). Anybody has a suggestion?"
4,"Almost five stars, but...","The first couple of times I listened to it, I enjoyed it all the way through. However, some of the tracks seemed to lose its effect--especially ""B-Boy Stance"" and ""We Rock Hard"" (6 & 7). They do have some catchy instrumental grooves like ""Breaker Beats Part 1,"" ""Feel the Panic,"" and ""Warning."" On their next album, I'd like for them to explore more into d'n'b (drum 'n bass) like they did in ""Warning,"" the final track. BTW, I originally bought it for ""Don't Stop"" and ""Here We Go,"" which I thought were great... ...until I heard the instrumentals."
2,Gary Hoyt,"If your into ""womens lib, battle of the sexes"" and which seems to be unending trivial female critisizems (sp)of men/husbands, then this DVD is for you.The cast is terrific---story lines/plots are poor."
5,the pasta bible,"Awesome book,great recipes!!!Easy to follow recipes.I made awesome ravioli's from the book.They were a big hit in my house!!!"
1,ick!,"Anna Stalter works with victims of sexual violence in her profession as a forensic psychologist. She has even produced educational videos about sexual predators. Why then, does she use these types of people as a vehicle for entertainment? I can't even begin to understand what her motivation is.This book is about a sick and violent individual, who gets his jollies from torturing children. I couldn't find anything redeeming in it. Particularly gruesome was the scene where the sexual predator described to one of the characters how he was going to mutilate her genitals. What is the point of this type of novel? Stalter should be ashamed of herself."
4,"Try it, you'll like it!","To All Young Blues Lovers! This CD shows an amazing young talent. If you are not familiar with blues music, I suggest you give this a listen. Excellent listening and gives promise of future amazing sounds. As an older citizen, I can definately listen to this CD all day!"
4,echoes of a distant past,"i have waited fifteen years for the sucsessors to robin trower and jimmy dewar, they are here. this is tasty stuff!"
5,Not your typical blues,"Just as we saw with SRV before his untimely death, the blues movement is taking many turns. No, this is not a blues recording in the traditional sense, but the blues can be expressed in many forms. That's what I see in this recording. Sure there's a lot of studio ""work"" on the album. But unfortunately that's the way his music will get the wide distribution it deserves. Just as we saw with Stevie, as this young man moves through his life he will stay true to his blues roots, but will also try to develop sounds that the comercial radio stations will air. Those of us who love the blues should support this young man as he moves the blues forward to the rest of the listening public."
5,Earing stand,Ours had no flaws in workmanship and seems sturdy. Longer earings will dangle over the holes in the row below but don't really interfere with use.
5,Heavenly,This is a great CD. I've owned it for 10 years and listened to it countless times. I continue to be amazed each time.
3,Needs Serious Remastering!,"No doubting the quality of the compositions, the performances of said compositions but the sound quality is really very poor. Let's hope Sony gets its act together and remaster the entire ""Great Performances"" catalog using the best possible master source in the vaults and re-release them all in mini-lp replica sleeve packaging. I can dream, can't I?"
1,"A bottom-of-the-barrel ""X-files"" ripoff","This piece of trash has fifth-rate copies of most of the characters in ""The X-files"" - an ersatz Cancer Man; Scully; and an unbelievably bad combination of Mulder and the Lone Gunmen, among others. Throw in the basic plot of the third Indiana Jones movie and a few old ""Twilight Zone"" episodes and you have a book that'll make you scream ""ENOUGH!"" after a few chapters. Why anyone would read, let alone write, such claptrap is beyond me. I do notice that this book and its sequels are on special order (4 - 6 weeks for delivery) which means that the publisher doesn't think too highly of it either; they have to dig it out of the basement whenever it's ordered.With any luck this will be out of print soon and it'll only be an extremely bad memory."
4,scientific spirit,"The book deals with embrylogy in a clinically oriented way which adds more weight to it. Making a correlation with the Qu' ranindicates that the writter has a scientific spirite in addition to his wide knowledge of the subject because science should not be affected by political, social and egocentric views. science follows the abstract truth wherever it is.Very good pictures and a powerful writing style.Try it before judge it."
1,Nice but I HAVE to rate it with one star.,"This case is nice as shown in the picture BUT as the most important thing is the mobile phone, I must rate this item with one star. Why? because the Blackberry Bold 9700 BARELY fits in the cel compartment and if you close the zipper it may scratch the phone as there is no ample room for the phone.As the phone is the most expensive and important item, I dont see how to rate this item any higher. If your phone is half an inch or more smaller than the Bold 9700, then this is right for you, if not, you are warned that the phone may be scratched by the zipper, bummer."
3,Welcome Race Fans Is Fun,"I came across a copy of this the other day, alone with 300+ other 90's era Christian Rock albums and this was one of the first few into my CD player. Of course I had to hear ""Grey Clouds"" first. The first reviewer is right, though. I dropped the band when they dropped Davia. Or maybe she dropped them to get married. Not a bad idea. The one song is well worth a quarter, though."
4,"A great Baroque sampler, New York style","""Baroque and on the Streets"" puts some old, classical-radio-station runVivaldi tunes into new fettle with the interpretation of New York street musicians.Banjo for harpsichord? Soprano sax (and hauntingly so) for recorder? You bet.The only reasons I didn't five-star this is because it's so short! Under 45 minutes. And, so hard to get. I had this on vintage vinyl when it first came out and it took years of hunting and waiting here and at other online sellers before I got it.And, Mr. Frederic Hand, can't we have more than a one-shot venture on this? I've got other ""experimental"" albums, like the Modern Mandolin Quintet; I like stuff like this."
5,ONE OF THE BEST NORTEL BOOK I HAVE SEEN!!,"This book covers in depth everything you need to know about the current Nortel router products. If you are seriously interested in learning about the router technology in general or Nortel router products in detail, this is the best book I have seen. Mr. Mahalingam has organized the material so well, both beginners and experienced readers can benefit from it. The technology is explained in an easy to understand manner, but still covers all the details.I found the flow of chapters sequential. Best book to buy, worth the investment. You will find yourself pulling the book off the shelf over and over again. Kudos to Mr. Mahalingam for a job so well done!!"
4,"Great Direction, Acting - Great Movie About Religious Persecution","Many films that touch on Catholic subjects are poorly directed or have terrible acting. This movie was well-directed and well-acted.At times, it was slow, but overall a great movie showing heroic courage under tyranny and violence. Also a great example of religion that is community-focused and peaceful.Worth watching more than once."
3,needs some edting.,"Fine acting makes this a must see. But some judicious editing could eliminate a half hour and make a tighter, more dynamic film."
2,Worse than expected,"I purchased this product for personal use, as it's a tester with no cap. I know cool water perfume for more than 13 years, but this one is so light and the smell goes away after a couple of hours.The bottom line is that I don't recommend this product to a friend."
3,Not Impressed,"I recently purchased the Clarity Max Plus for my ornamental pond. We had algea bloom and couldn't seem to get it under control. I bought it because of the recomendation of a co-worker. The product improved the problem but never actaully got rid of it as it said it would and I even doubled the dosage and prayed it didn't kill our fish but still the green water persisted. I hope it works better as a maintence product than an actual treatment, I have since drained my pond and cleaned it out and started over. I'm crossing my fingers."
5,Straight to the point,"Forget the emotional posing and the masturbatory use of the ""method"" in today's actors and acting teachers. Doug gets right to the point and gives you the raw, essential tools provided by the Stanislavski/Strasburg Method. Stop letting the ""feelings"" of attention-seeking actors confuse you. Great tools are to be found in this book."
3,"Not very ""Smooth"" - thankfully","The idea of Carlos Santana jamming with the likes of Tony Williams, Wayne Shorter, Ron Carter, et. al., is more brilliant in design than execution. Chemistry is somewhat lacking, and the whole thing never really gels. Still, ""Swing"" is better than Carlos' post-2000 duet output. Stick with ""Caravanserai"" and ""Welcome"": the New Santana Band was a tight crew on these albums."
2,A $199 bucks for this album?,"I picked it up today for $8 bucks NEW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!What kind of ripoff is going on here at Amazon?As for the review,Carlos wasn't an Al DiMeiola or John McLaughlin on this album ,so it is at best,a so so effort.Sorry ,but Carlos ain't got them kinda chops.Listenable,but forgettable.For 8 bucks it's worth a shot,but for $199,you'd be better off buying at least 8 or 9 hundred better fusion albums from the 70's or 80's.Needs a remaster badly!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Just don't get it...,SCI is one of my favorite bands but I just don't get this one. What I love about the band is the unbridled excitement of the music. The music on this album is so overproduced that none of that comes through.
3,WHAT THE HECK?,"I have always LOVED The Saddle Club books......but.........WHAT THE HECK? These newer Saddle Club books are way out of wack. I mean, The Saddle Club not love Horses' anymore? AAAAAAAHHHHHHHH! A total NIGHTMARE! I, personally, used to LOVE The Saddle Club books, now I'm not so sure.................."
4,STILL ROCKIN! WE SAW JERRY RIOPELLE IN TEMPE...'03,"THIS MUSIC IS GREAT. MUCH LIKE THE OLD STUFF THAT WE CAN'T GET ON CD...HERE'S A THRILL! WHAT A SURPRISE WE HAD THIS SUMMER'03...TEMPE TOWN LAKE HAD A SUMMER MUSIC SERIES, AND CLOSED OUT THE SEASON WITH ONE OF OUR FAVORITE LOCAL BANDS,"" CHUCK E. BABY AND THE ALLSTARS ""- WE WERE ENJOYING CHUCK E. BABY, AND HE WAS DOING FINE JUST PLAYING SOME OF HIS OWN ORIGINAL MUSIC, WHEN HE ANNOUNCES A SPECIAL GUEST.. ""AND LET'S ALL WELCOME AN ARIZONA FAVORITE, MR. JERRY RIOPELLE!"" THEY ROCKED A FEW OF JERRY RIOPELLE SONGS WITH HIM AND JAMMED OUT! JERRY AND CHUCK E. SOUNDED GREAT TOGETHER! CHECK OUT chuckebaby.com MAYBE IT WILL HAPPEN AGAIN!~HUGE FAN OF BOTH~"
2,Just didn't get it,"Weird 'ending.' Just weird movie. Don't get it and didn't understand it at all. Overall, it depressed me and made me not want to watch any Lena Dunham anything"
1,It's official,"I have finally seen the WORST movie I've ever seen my whole life! I was a ""20 something"" girl 30 years ago, but I haven't forgotten what it was like because frankly I'm amazed it's been so long already. This movie is flat, very boring, with no story line whatsoever. and the worst acting of any movie or show that I've seen. UGH don't waste your time on this one! I'd give it zero stars if I could!and, excuse me to the reviewer who said so, but ""most"" girls act this way? NO WAY. I never acted this way, and none of my friends ever did, either. Sure we all have our bad days, but this story is too unrealistic for words. I don't expect reality from movies, but this one is so far removed that it ought to be a cartoon. Pathetic.I wouldn't even say it was character driven. The characters are flat, emotionless, pathetic excuses for human beings. I shudder to think that other women/girls believe that we ""all"" are like Aura. God help us if that's true. I've never even FELT like being like her."
3,Relaxing,Overall a good buy. I would have liked an electric guitar version such as some of them floating on the Internet.
1,"lame, lamer, and pretentious","Olsen is a phony--a writer who takes potshots at obvious targets like academic workshops and corporate publishing, and yet cannot come up with alternative concepts, all the while dishing out tired and hackneyed exercises and pointers, page after page of cliche and lame-osity.Postmodern for the sake of postmodernism? Please."
1,What You See is not What You Get,"With a proliferation of Vivaldi Four Seasons recordings in CD, SACD and DVD-Audio formats, this HD-DVD should have been the standout item in ones collection that is already brimming with multiple versions of the same. With the cover offering a tantilising glimpse of the orchestra, I bought this on the premise that it would be a video of the concert performance. I am most unhappy that this is not the case. The scenery slideshow is pretty enough but like most people who will buy this disc based on what is on the cover, they will be disappointed."
5,Garden Sprayer Kit,Just what I needed and at a fair price. Checked other sites for the same thing and could not find one to beat this site at Amazon.
2,Not a very good sensor,"This lamp is good looking and easy to install, but I am not happy with the functioning of the sensor. It seems very sensitive straight on. It senses cars going by in the street about 50 feet away, but doesn't sense me walking by the side, only 15 feet away. If I set it to high sensitivity to get nearby movements, the light goes on very frequently due to street activity. I plan to change lamps, since I want one that turns the light on when someone approaches the front door from the side where my driveway is, but doesn't turn on every time a car goes by."
4,playing with the atom,I ordered The Atom to complete my DC Collection. I thought it was black from the picture on the monitor so I was a little bummed that it was blue but still the toy was awesome. I have a lot of figures that fall apart but this one seems made well and looks cool. I would buy it again!
4,Box Collection,"This book has great colored photos of many different antique boxes. A pleasure to look through - especially ifone is a collector. These examples are all very elegant and not the primitive boxes that some people collect. It isnice to own a book with all these beautiful boxes and know that one need not own the actual expensive originals.Antique Boxes, Tea Caddies, & Society 1700-1880 (A Schiffer Book for Collectors)"
4,"Fits perfectly, works great","Very nice and cost effective replacement wand for Gilmour Spray-Doc sprayers, replaced the brass ended sprayer wand that was missing"
5,Jazz classical fusion...wow,"Bolling, while being a beast on jazz piano, is best know for his compositional skills. Listen to this album and you'll know why. Each piece has it's own distinct style, but all have that amazing jazz groove without being pure jazz. In addition, Maurice Andre is considered to be the greatest classical trumpeter of all time, and this album shows off his many skills, from the mellow flugelhorn to his brilliant pic trumpet work, he is a master of all styles. Jazz fans, pianists and trumpeters will love this album, as well as classical buffs looking for something different. Truly great stuff here."
4,Double dose of interstellar political intrigue,"Two beings, one human and one alien, are each plotting treason and revolution. Their reasons and methods are vastly different. Initially, they aren't even aware of each other's existence. Neither can apparently do anything to help the other. Yet, they come to realize they need each other to succeed. The characters are all well drawn, with real personalities complete with odd twists and flaws. The aliens are amazingly real and complex. This is going to be a great series, one that focuses not just on the action, but also on the political and psychological bases for the action."
3,Amateur Mixing !,"This is a strong live record by Great White but there is a stop gap between each track which completely ruins the feel of a live cd. You would think that Sidewinder would have fixed this before reissuing it on their own label. But, they did not. Some of the tracks start and stop so abruptly that it sound like part of the song is missing. This is very unprofessional and it should not have been released like this much less reissued."
1,If I could give it a zero star I would,"First of all, I want to make it clear that I was supposed to be at the station fire in RI, where Great White played in 2003 and 100 people died. Many of them were my friends. Jack Russell, who in my opinion is a punk stated that he would never play Desert Moon live again out of respect for all the lives lost. Apparently, all he cares about is money because as you can see the song is the first song, as it was in Feb of 2003 when 100 people lost their lives selflessly. Jack Russell was never charged, and really took no responsibility for what happened, even though it was his tour and he was the boss. The least he could have done was kept his word about not playing that song again ever. I was a fan of Great White in the 80s and didn't go that night because I had a headache. Many of my friends did go. Some lived, some died, and some were injured. Jack Russell could have at the very least kept his word about not playing that song again."
2,Not very inspiring,"This was the first of Chaosium's collections of out-of-print Mythos tales, and can hardly be expected to be as refined as later editions. The most useful aspects of the Hastur Cycle are the exploration of the evolution of the concept of Hastur and the major stories about the Mi-go. Of course, I agree with everyone here that the two concepts should not have been joined.The two Chambers tales, ""The yellow Sign"" and ""the Repairer of Reputations"" are both excellent, as well as ""the Return of Hastur"". Some of the Mi-go tales are pretty good, but clearly the best is ""The Whisperer in the Darkness"", which can be found elsewhere. Otherwise, it all seemed pretty derivative. I would look for the stories separately."
3,good read,"lovecraft's story here is my personal favorite. derleth's is a good one. in addition chambers have his Yellow king here, his masterpiece. Bierce is here, though i'm not a fan of him, his stories have an interesting concept. brennan's story is not that great, but i was amused. wagner's story contains a very well written opening, but the concept turns out to be poor. between 3 and 4 stars, i'd say. i have to agree that the last part of the anthology, with this mysterious race or whatever, shouldn't been here. hastur turned out to be an entertaining concept."
4,Great Book!,"I would definitely recommend this book to anyone trying to learn VB .NET. James Foxall is a very talented author who writes clearly and explains in detail. The only drawback to this book is that it doesn't go as in depth and as far-reaching as I might like. For instance, he only has a few-page overview of web programming, which I think he could have omitted or put as an appendix since it contains little information to have its own hour. After seeing his webpage, www.jamesfoxall.com, I can see that Mr. Foxall is a very personable individual, and I probably would have bought the book after only browsing his website. All in all, I would highly recommend this book to anyone wanting to learn VB .NET, but I would point out that you might want to get another book with more material in it."
4,My First Terri Clark CD,I've always been a Terri clark fan but this is the first cd I've purchased by her. I was surprised at how much I really enjoyed this cd! Terri has an amazing voice and the songs kept me listening to the cd over and over again!
4,Strong Album,This is another great album by one of the only true female country music artist left in country music. Terri Clark juest seems to keep getting better with each new album she releases. There is not a weak track to be found on this CD either. A must have for any fan of true country music.
3,"""Check THIS Book Out"" !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","This book is about a young boy who is 12 years old and needs to survive on his own in the forest,because one day his family went out to sea and never came back. But then he rescues an Indian Chief and teaches him how to speak English. I like this book because it's about a kid living in the forest by himself."
1,Critical Reading?,"In reading everybody else's reviews of this book, I see that nobody has seen the negative way that Native women are portrayed. This book is set in a period where there was little contact with Europeans. Prior to contact, and in the early stages, women held influential positions within their tribe. They, and their work, was seen as important, not demeaning. In Sign of the Beaver, the women and their work are belittled. Repeatedly, they are called ""squaw"" by both Matt and Attean. Squaw is a derogatory word. It is highly improbable that Attean would have feelings of disdain for the women in his tribe, and it is highly unlikely that he would use the white man's word ""squaw"" to refer to them. Matt, perhaps, but certainly not Attean. While many argue it is a good adventure/survival story, I think we must step back and think about that appraisal."
4,Book Review,This book was very helpful in my newphew's homework assignment. There were none at the local library so as always Amazon.com was there to the rescue.
1,worst story ever written!,this book is a total snoozer! my class had to read it and it was the most painful thing i've ever done. the plot is so used and old! plus it was the most boring thing i've ever read. when we finished it i ripped it in half and threw it away. don't bore your brains out by reading this awful book.
4,This is a okay book.,I give it four stars because I really didn't like it.But it is a pretty good book.I recmind this book to kids who like to read alot.It is about a boy who stayed at his cabin because his father went to get his family.This young boy has a great adventure with an Indian.It is a very exciting book to read.So if you like storys about the past I recmind this book to you.
4,An awesome story,"I am 10 year old Girl who loves sign of the beaver. At first I thought I wouldn't enjoy It couse it was about a boy, and I was a girl but, At the end It started to get hearT breaking an, I was like whats going to happen next what what what! At the end I found out that It was fantastic, and so I can't explain It it is so amazing I thing you should check It out for yourself! My mom is a Homeschooling mom, And she read sign of the Beaver as a read aloud to me and my brother. And we so enjoyed IT! And I am thinking about, Reading it alone since I enjoyed IT SO MUCH!SIGNED, ABBEY"
3,5th grade student review (crc),"The Sign of the Beaver is an ok book. If you like nature and Indians, you'll like this book. This book is about a boy named Matt. Matt and his father are building a cabin in Maine. When they finish, Matt's father has to go back to Massachusets to get the rest of the family. While Matt's father is gone, Matt has many adventures being alone. If you want to know what happens to Matt all you have to do is read the book!!!"
2,To read or not to read???,"Sign of the Beaver is an... ok book. Not many interesting words or facsinating scences. This book is more for the ""nature"" kids! It is quite boring in certain parts, but has a good plot.Matt a thirteen year old boy is plopped in the center of the woods. He has no friends there until he oddly is attacked by bees! He is saved by and old grandfather and his grandson...wow. Matt has to pay him back by teaching the Indian's grandson Attean, to read. Even though it is ok... I would NOT reccomend it for ANY classroom reading. I had to FORCE myself to read it. Thank you for your time."
5,Matt and Attean enjoy a very interesting cultural encounter.,"This story brings together two worlds, as it may have happened during our country's beginnings. Readers see the awakening of cultural understanding and friendship among two young boys living in Maine. Learning from each other about each other's worlds, Matt a young white settler and Attean a young Indian boy both learn to trust each other, even for their survival. The book was fun to read and is interesting for almost any student."
5,Excellent book for bigenner to intermediate,"This book is a great book for beginners to intermediate programmer - for text as well as for reference. To the point examples for learning RPG IV. I would say It's an excelent book available in the market on this subject. The author uses many examples that are easy to understand and practical. Each chapter has a useful Q&A section at the end.I'll say to author ""Thank you - You've done a wonderful work for RPG IV"""
4,"Good Book, but needs a little work.","This book was well written. Thanks to Stanley Myers for a book to help us RPG Programmers! The only thing that I found wrong with this book is that Stanley mentions old style (RPG AS/400 and before) programming mixed in the chapter. A better approach would have been if he had included old style techniques at the end of each chapter and not mixed in with the new RPGLE. It was a little confusing at times, but still a great reference book for any RPG Programmer!"
1,Save 25 bucks......,"They FINALLY lowered the price on this set. It use to be you would save if you bought them seperate. As of June 2004 you can save about $25, so id definately reccomend this set. If you dont have HBO it is a must buy."
1,Useless dribble,"Okay, I shoud have guessed it before I bought it, but all this book is is a publication of some e-mails. Most are from the same couple of people who like to hear themselves talk. Please save your money!!! You'll thank me."
3,Old fashioned story,This is an old fashioned story about a high ranking Scottish chieftainess who was orphaned at birth and brought up in a huge castle on the moors. It is fascinating for what it reveals about the time and place and has nothing to do with white people as a race. Quite beautifully written by the famous author.
1,crappy heating,this thing can even keep my kingsnake warm and she's in a 20 gallon tank and it says it's for 10 - 20 gallon more like 5 - 10 gallon. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.
5,Great heater,I put this on the side of my hermit crab tank and the little guys love it. It creates the perfect temp. for their cage and was a good price on amazon.
4,Heat pad,"The temperature stays just right for my ball python and is reliable with creating an ambient temperature. It doesn't want to stick very well to my Sterilite tub, but I made it work. A side note with this, the pad is not intended for use on acrylic or any type of plastic tub...I found this out after I bought it. I have been using this pad with no problems and so have other reptile owners I've spoken with on YouTube; they even recommend it for your reptiles. I also will recommend this product for future Herpers and veteran owners."
5,Thorogood American Heritage Boots,"Some of the best boots I have purchased in some time. The soles are still doing good, which is where I am most concerned these days with boots. Very comfortable, broke in easily without any blisters, but I also where wool socks which helps. I would recommend them."
1,Great -- for a little while,"When I bought this unit it worked fine, although it is a little slow to respond to commands. However, after a few months, it stopped reading DVDs. It gives me an ""incorrect disc error,"" no matter what DVD I put in. I e-mailed Pioneer about the problem and got the response to unplug it for a few hours. That trick worked once. Then Pioneer said it must need repair. I had bought the Pioneer brand for its quality reputation, and was sorely disappointed to get only a few months' use out of the machine."
2,"Disappointing sequel to ""If..."" and ""O Lucky man""","A reporter (McDowell)investigates the chaos of a strike-bound hospital, only to find himself falling victim to the ghastly experiments of a demented surgeon (Crowden). After the measured excesses of ""if.."" and ""O Lucky Man"" this film makes a course for the cheapest laugh, failing to entertain along the way. The sense of parody in the first two films was always off-beat, and the better for it, but ""Brittania Hospital"" misses the target altogether."
3,Toshiba 42DPC85 Green dot problem as well.,"First off this is a really decent entry level plasma TV. Loads of inputs and a decent image from 10ft away. The internal speakers are nice as well.That being said, like the other poster my unit was great until around 6 months. I just noticed green dots randomly being displayed on the upper 1/4 of the TV. I'm contacting Toshiba directly and hopefully this will be taken care of under warranty.12/5/06 **Toshiba is replacing my unit with a 42HP66** In the meantime my current set is barely limping along with a full screen of green dots."
1,Toshiba 42DPC85 EDTV Plasma Panel Failure,"After our set failed yesterday, I scrambled to find some troubleshooting information on the internet and was shocked to find that other owners had experienced the exact same problem/symptoms. We purchased our set on December 29th 2005 and were happy with the product until yesterday (January 13th, 2007). While we were watching there was an audible pop and the plasma display went blank, although the sound from the satellite feed is still working. We have lifetime service (labor only - not parts) through the local retailer we purchased the set from, but who knows how Toshiba will respond since we are 15 days past expiration date for the factory warranty."
2,Not worth the money,Product does NOT work as specified. From the moment I took it out of the box it did NOT work as it should..Magnet inside does NOT turn as it should. Mechanism is not designed well...and I am a machinist....
4,"Great set, but the skillet sticks a bit","I love this set, the stockpot is just great for soups and stews and when you have to make large amounts of mashed potatoes or pastas. I also love the sauce pan to make sauces and such in. My only negative is the skillet. It just sticks a bit much for me. I use my non-sticks instead for frying. Other than that I consider this a great set."
3,Mixed Review,"Positive Points: Price is very good [$59.99 at the time], seem solid, heat transfers well and clean up is better than my experience with the anodized Calphalon [and I DO follow instructions!]...and they can be polished to a luster. Also, the cover for the large pot will work with the fry pan.Negative: the quality/craftmanship is not top-end...my set exhibited some stamping issues [eg, ""rings"" are apparent in the metal, the edges are rough in some places] and some scratches...but mine might have been a previous ""return""...not sure.I kept the set...they do perform well and, as long as you're not going over them carefully, their appearance is acceptable...can't beat the price if you want an affordable intro to stainless Cuisinart."
5,Sensational video,"This is the definitive video on WWI. Based on Hew Strachan's great book. Viewer will learn more about the ""Great War"" from this series than any course they could take. Video quality is excellent and narrative is compelling. If you are interested in understanding the world today, don't miss this video. Origins of Iraq, Palestine, Israel...all remnants of defeated Ottoman empire are all here."
5,Excellent product,"If you are interested in WWI, this DVD set is amazing. All original footage. Extensive coverage. Highly recomended."
5,The First World War; The Complete Series,"Excellent overview of WW1 That traces the causes of the war and the varies alliances. Touches on major battle front throughout Europe, Asia and Africa. Produced by Channel 4 in England you get a better feeling for the European/ Allied view of the whys and horrors of the entire war, including recently found material from the Balkan countries."
3,No subtitles for the hearing impaired,"The dvds are in perfect condition, box, discs etc. everything is great, except for the fact that the seller did not specify that they have no subtitles..."
5,"simple,smart,and cool...","it has a good design,so portable,and windy for my laptop...cooling it.it's very good for 14"" laptop."
3,Works erratically,"The Aerolatte was my first attempt at a home frother. When it works, it makes pretty good froth. There are two serious problems: (1) It can get gunk in the place where the whisk meets the motor, then it doesn't go at all; and (2) Even when it is working, it slows down as soon as it hits the milk.At full speed, it froths milk well. About 85% of the time it's going half speed, which makes frothing a frustration. About 5% of the time, it doesn't go until you clean up the connection to the handle.I purchased the manual BonJour Caffee Froth Monet to augment the Aerolatte, and now fine myself using the BonJour every day. It requires no batteries, produces dependable froth, and is fun to use.Update: This just stopped working after a few uses. I threw it out."
1,\PLASTIC! PLASTIC! PLASTIC! Knowingly DECEPTIVE marketing.,"The description goes out of its way to avoid acknowledging that the handle (motor housing) of this unit is made out of cheap plastic. Not sure just from looking at the picture, I went to the trouble of double checking on the aerolatte.com web site. There, they tout this model as ""brushed aluminum."" Oh no, that doesn't mean it is actually MADE out of brushed aluminum (how could anyone possibly get such a mistaken impression?) ""Brushed aluminum"" is just their name for the finish. Isn't that obvious? Why should they include any language to clarify that it's not brushed aluminum? For merely a plastic model made in China, this one is an overpriced rip off. There are many much less expensive alternatives on the market."
3,Works well when the batteries are new. But you can froth milk in French Press!,"I have owned this for about 5 years. I use a stover top espresso maker which works about as well as electric steam type. I have found that the electric pump type that are less than $250.00 don't work that well, and take up too much counter space in a small kitchen. This does work, but I found something that froths milk much better than this and much faster.Use a small Bodum 4 cup French Press. Put your milk in the French Press (not the same one you are making your coffee in. Get a second smaller one) and rapidly work the plunger up and down for about 10 to 20 seconds. You have frothier milk in less than half the time and you won't need to change batteries every two weeks."
2,Great until it stopped working,"I received this from my wife for Christmas along with an espresso pot. It worked amazingly to froth milk up for amazing at-home lattes and cappucinos. It was also great for mixing chocolate milk. It ran through its batteries pretty quickly but I attributed that to frequent use. It again quickly started to weaken so I changed the batteries a second time (in about 3 months)but this time the frother was no better. There was a small amount of corrosion at the base of the handle (despite always being place in the drying rack with the handle up). After that it basically just stopped working. I'm not sure if it was just mine, but I wouldn't necessarily get another one. I really miss it though so maybe..."
4,"works great, clean immediatately after use","Be sure to clean this thing immediately, and I do mean immediately, after every use. If you don't, the milk will solidify in the little coils and will be a pain to clean. Other than that it works flawlessly, and the price is right."
5,Great for the price,"Was looking for a better coffee experience, for some reason couldn't find a simple milk frother anywhere. So I went to amazon, like the reviews for this and bought it. My wife has tried it and loves it. It does take a little time to whip up the milk, and the longer you go the better it gets. Don't know if there's more powerful models that would do it quicker but for the price this is exactly what we were looking for."
1,broke,"I used mine a few times and now it doesn't work. Don't know what the problem is, to much trouble to return."
2,Bad Quality,"Length:: 0:49 MinsBad experience. Batteries would ""wiggle"" inside the battery compartment which made it operate incorrectly. I returned it and was left with the impression that the device had quality/design and manufacture problems."
5,Works so well!,"This is great, so easy to froth milk for coffee and other smaller jobs. Solid and comes in a nice case."
3,Received and did not work,"I received this unit and it did not work, but by bending the battery connections, I was able to get it to work. Once I got it to work, it has been very good and handy for the price."
5,aerolatte frother,"I'm sure if Oprah knew about this she would have it on her ""Favorite things"" segment. I heat a small amountof milk in the microwave, while I am making espresso with my aeropress. Then I use this little wonder machinejust as directed to whip the milk and pour it into the espresso. Viola, a non-fat latte here at home, saving $4.00over Starbucks and others.I've had it a month and probably have used it more than 100 times. Absolutely love it so much I ordered 4 more as Christmas gifts!"
2,Died one month after Mother's Day,This was a gift I'd asked my children for as a Mother's Day gift. I do not have the heart to tell them that it just stopped working. I replaced the batteries because I thought that was the problem but 2 fresh sets proved that it was the frother itself. A shame. Now I'm back to my manual pump frother. Would not recommend it.
4,Works great,"Easy, fast, and convenient. Now I can make a passable latte in my own kitchen by just frothing a little milk in the bottom of a glass and adding hot coffee. The milk doesn't even have to be hot, the coffee will warm it. My only concern is, it seems very fragile and may bend or break in a year or two. I wish more things were built to last."
3,"Lasted 1 year, then died","I spent the money when I could bought something much cheaper because I wanted it to last. Given the recent reviews of it lasting a day to a month, I'm surprised I got a year of out it.While it lasted it was great! I'll give it that. But something is going on where it sudden won't/can't make a connection to the batteries anymore. WHY it is suddenly dead is just as much a mystery to me."
3,is that paper?,"i thought that 244lbs seemed kinda low for 3/8"" rope, but the core is a paper fibery mix. the description states that it is good around water, but it seems (from life's experiences) that paper gets waterlogged. another complaint is that if you cut it it will immediately unravel, and i normally use a lighter to singe the ends but with the paper core this made a bunch of ash and smoke. i wish that i new that ""poly"" included materials that were not polyurethane."
2,Read reviews before you buy,"I should have read the reviews before I purchased this product. The product description was lacking in information. I was going to purchase the same line at Lowes for $8.88 (normal price) but after looking at it closely I knew it wouldn't work for the job I need it for. I never realized this was the same line I had rejected. It's like the drill sargent said KISS. Live, pay and then learn.I give it two (2) stars."
2,Not the best biography of Robert La Follette,"The are pluses and minuses to Davis Thelen's biography on Wisconsin's ""Fighting Bob"" La Follette.The biggest plus, it was short (211 pages) and to the point. Not filled with mindless babble about every little personal detail of the man's life, like you see some biographers write.The book also shows, in Thelen's opinion, how La Follette was really out to be get re-elected, in the earliest years of his political life, rather than become the insurgent leader of the people. According to Thelen that came later, not from the onset.The biggest minuses were that it focused way to much on the progressive insurgence movement. While this was a major part of La Follette's life it was not everything! Some of Thelen's views are also very controvesal and subject for much debate.If your looking for a quick overview of progressivism, insurgency, and Robert La Follette then this is the book for you. If you are looking for details you will be disappointed."
3,"Too low-key, too precious","I find this album too low-key, too precious. There's no doubting that these are superb songs mostly well sung but I'm finding that I really have to be in the right mood to sit through an album of 15 ballads (Ok, 'Up, Up and Away' isn't a ballad but even that's taken at a snail's pace here). You wonder why the album was apparently so long in the making when most of the tracks are little more than voice/piano arrangements. The great thing about Webb-based albums in the past was the variety of song styles and tempos on offer, something that this collection lacks. For me the album reaches some sort of peak through tracks 3-5 (Feinstein really gets his teeth into the beautiful 'She Moves, Eyes Follow'), but dips somewhat with characterless versions of 'The Moon's a Harsh Mistress' and 'Adios'. However, I have to say it's a good idea once again for the middle bit of 'MacArthur Park' to be treated as a seperate entity as it's undoubtably one of Webb's best melodies."
5,Oh WOW!,Stonewall...is excellent! The kinda bluesy moaning guitar. The rolling bass. The pulsing drums....and that vioce. Its a musical orgasm!
4,Hard Rock with a 90's edge!,"Stonewall's Dark Days, takes you on a rollercoaster like journey, that will Rock you and entertain you. A far cry from the plethora of one-trick ponies trotting around the commercial market. Medicine is an opening stunner, climbing from a wicked growl, into a full on rocker. With an Alice in chains meets Ronnie Dio Vocal Melody, and Metallica type riffing. The title track ""Dark Day's,"" is sure to be a hit. It's catchy chorus and over the top guitar solo, will keep you singing the melody long after the music has Stopped. The only ""ballad"" of sorts, Is the Haunting ""Insomnia,"" and with it's catchy but dark melody line, can only be described as beutifully wicked. Stonewall signifies a brilliant change for American Metal,seperate pasts forged into the present. The album contains 13 Rockin tracks, and a bonus track that will keep you laughing in a guilty kind of way.And best of all, there is no Rap!"
1,Who says hes out,"WHat makes you think hes out of the life.. he never flipped per si, and when you consider non profit scams this book is one chapter in an ongoing saga.. cant wait to read the next ,,, cheep entertainment"
5,Soul Music,Product arrived on time and in great condition...very pleased! CD in excellent condition! Thrilled to have it as part of my collection again! Definitely a worthy investment.
5,Erykah who? Lauryn who? India who?,"I say what I say in my above title because she sounds like a mixture of all those artists and then some. However, if those artists hadn't done their thing first, their would be no soul/neo-soul Lisa McClendon gospel singer, so I gotta give them their props. Anyway, the album was bangin from start to finish. Songs like ""Hey Now"", ""Stuck"", ""Grace Grace Grace"", and ""Capture"", really had my ears twitching for more after hearing them. Touches the spirit and the soul. My favorites are ""Old School"", ""Has Anybody Seen Love"", and the aforementioned ""Capture"". Gospel music is rising to a new stratosphere in excellence, and soon it's gonna be like the old days when the secular artists used to copy us instead of these days when we are doin most of the copying. But w/ gospel artists like Tonex, Deitrick Haddon, Fred Hammond, and yes, Lisa McClendon, we have nothing to worry about. Keep it up Lisa! God Bless."
4,Pretty Good Album,"Commissioned has been one of the many gospel influences in my life. On this CD I have four favorite songs, which are ""Testify"", ""You Been Good"", ""Trying of Your Faith"", and the remake of ""Ordinary Just Won't Do"". I do have a testimony, though. I have been seraching for a permanent job since my husband was severely sick a year ago. I had no insurance, so he couldn't see a doctor to get well. But yesterday, I just got a full-time, PERMANENT job, and I just praise God, because He was looking out for me. Know this, the trying of your faith worketh patience!!!"
5,Smooth as Honey,"I was thrilled hear that these brothers are still together. Testify,One Love, even the remake of Ordinary Won't Do. As always quality production and excellent harmony. I Love ya brothers, maintain the focus."
5,another excellent project,WOW! this album has really lift my spirit i have recieved a new anointing within me i heard a beautiful message in every song each one pertained to something i was going through min my life i'd like to thank you commissioned for a project well done and very spirited god bless you all
4,Really big and holds a lot,"The Feren Backpack holds my Dell Inspiron E1505, widescreen 15.4"" laptop, 3 books, a couple of folders, my wallet, pens, pencils, personal items, water bottles, and lunch. It is pretty comfortable to wear on the back or over 1 shoulder. Because I'm short, it is often difficult to lug it in and out of my car, but I love it. Sturdy carry handle on top and plenty of pockets and a cell phone case that detaches."
3,"Good for hiking, too bulky for school","A really great backpack for hiking. Compared to other backpacks, it is very comfortable to wear, even fully loaded. Lots of nice pockets - even an insulated compartment for snacks!However, if you are looking to buy a backpack for school, probably this isn't the one you want. It's far too bulky, and at the same time it doesn't allow you to carry more than 1-2 thick textbooks. So, if you want something to carry only 1-2 textbooks, or a laptop and some papers/thin notebooks, you don't want this, because you really don't need so much backpack for the job! And, if you do want to be able to transport all your textbooks and notebooks back and forth a lot, this thing just doesn't have enough room to let you do so."
1,Let There Be Light,"I love the Mail Order Bride Series, but series 10 was not well done. The beginning is unnecessary and leaves you wondering. Jenny is like a Jekyll and Hyde character. If your life is closely in tune with Christ, as Dan's was, you would be able to see there were problems with Jenny, especially after a month of courtship. There is no info on their courtship. The entire story felt like we were being rushed with many of the events and the finales disappointing and abrupt. Toomey's story seemed incomplete. This is the worst book I have read of any books in quite a long time. Very disappointing for great authors."
4,Classic rock at it's best!,"This is a good CD for someone that has had a taste of Heart to complete their Best Of- collection. Tracks are taken from Little Queen, Bebe Le Strange, Dreamboat Annie, Dog & Butterfly, Magazine, and several live preformances. The CD version, however, has 3 fewer songs than the two LP (vinyl) set. (The 3 missing songs are: Hit Single, Strange Euphoria, and Unchained Melody.)If you're a Heart Fan, this is a great addition to your CD library. For the serious collector, while there are tracks here that you can't get anywhere else, I suggest that you find the vinyl version."
2,Not that Great,It's ok but I would not waste my money on it. I think the only way to get great Heart tunes is to buy them seperatly. It seems like all of their albums have more horrible songs then good ones and of course the good ones are not together and in the middle of the album. So I say x-ay to this one.
4,80s Classic Rock,"Well this may be Heart's best compilation so far, the classic hits in this one still prove to be awesome now..."
5,A Book about an Incredible Human Spirit,"This is a book about a man who can set very difficult goals and overcome vast obstacles to accomplish them.This is a book written by a man who is more ENABLED than you or me.Whether his Harley's pipes are roaring across the Sahara or Dave's lost in the Gobi, the reader is with him, experiencing the daily hardships and joy of the journey. The reader gets the feel of what it would be like to actually do this journey himself.What a guy !!!"
3,"Great in spots, some misses","Dolly is one of the few artists who deserve the ""tribute"" treatment and this cd is a worthy addition to your arsenal. There are a couple of skippable tunes in this collection, however. Melissa Etheridge butchers ""I will always love you"" in the grand tradition of Whitney. Shania Twain with Alison Krauss is a vomit inducing idea, but it is pulled off quite servicably here. Another drawback: this cd could easily be 30 tracks longer. It is a good, yet rudimentary, look at Dolly Parton."
1,Weak singing doesn't do justice to Dolly's compositions,"Skip this one. I can't understand what all these reviewers are praising this CD about. Stick with Dolly Parton's original versions. There is some incredibly weak (and bad) singing on this CD, with Melinda Etheridge and Skinhead O'Conner leading the worst of the worst. Only Emmylou Harris and Alison Krauss' versions of Dolly's songs are worth listening to. I would love to know what Dolly honestly thinks of these performances. Sigh. I promptly gifted this CD to a lesbian."
1,Surprisingly Very Disappointing,"I have bought many music DVDs from Amazon, and have generally been very pleased with them. But this one, Arthur Rubeinstein Piano Concertos, was a great disappointment. In the first place, although the Region Code was 0, Worldwide, I could not play it on my video player which has had no problems with Amazon-bought DVDs in the past. It could play only on my computer. Secondly, when I played it on my computer, the sound was unbelievably choppy, not at all what I expected from a quality product. In short, the product was defective! And I could not return it as I first played it, for reasons of my own, 2 months after I ordered it.So, do you want to have this product? I would advise you to be very careful about buying it."
5,Color,Mine came in red. The spindle is very handy. It does soak up more water than the other yellow poly rope though.
4,I Agree,"I agree with firegirl a few reviews below. We're all alone is one of Boz's most powerful ballads. Very sensual. Great CD, great artist, great song!"
5,Couldn't Put it Down,I stayed up pretty late last night finishing the book--I just couldn't put it down. I wanted to find out what happened to each character--which future would play itself out--I wasn't disappointed.
4,A good introduction,"I needed to learn how to use Excel quickly for a new job and Personal Trainer was a good tool. The book is organized into chapters and lessons that increase in complexity as you progress. The opening lessons are simplistic and if you have basic computer knowledge, you can skip them. My advice is to go to the back of each lesson, where there is a brief bulleted synopsis, to decide whether you need to study it in depth. There is also a disk that includes interactive lessons that you complete as you read. While I had no experience with Excel before purchasing the book, I now feel confident that I can perform even complex tasks such as writing and editing macros and making pivot tables without much difficulty."
3,Good stuff with bad personality,"I had this booster to increase the receiving signal from one bar to 2-3 bars. It was function as promised. However, something you need to know which does not explicitly explain in the manu. Signal dropped from weak 54MB/s to strong 10MB/s for steadly receivig signal (can not stay with 801.11G and switch to 801,11b speed), second when you use the enclosed software to install proper driver as suggested. My original wireless driver was removed from the laptop without warning. When I tried to use my laptop at other strong signal place without using booster, I could not connect to any wireless access point , and original wireless driver can't be found and need to reinstall original wireless driver again. It took a while to find out why laptop won't work anymore. This is good stuff but it took over the system and install it own with unwant consequence.KK"
3,Alfa 1-2 Miles? No way! 400',"It is easy to install. If anyone says it can work 1-2 miles they are full of it. A few hundred feet at best.There is no way of picking up a signal a mile away for under $50. I like it but would not recommend it unlessyou only need a small boost and not from a store hundreds of feet away. Well worth the price. Go for the optional15' extension. I placed a plastic water bottle on it to keep it dry and have it on a 15' pole. The larger additionalantenna is a throw away, it makes the signal worse."
1,It's going back today!,"I don't normally write reviews, but I'm so aggravated with this thing, I decided to this time. I followed the directions exactly in the pdf file to install the drivers and hardware. All seemed well until the configuration point, the utility did not get installed. After fiddling around with no success, I watched the Vista installation video that's on the disc. It used some different steps (I HATE inconsistency in documentation!) and NEVER even showed the configuration steps, which is what most folks would need help with. I tried un/re-installing and still didn't get the config utility. There is no support info listed anywhere in the package that I could find, so it's going back. There's no way I'm connecting something to my network without knowing it's secured properly."
3,Works fine....setup is a pain,"I bought this unit on the recommendation of a friend that is something of a computer expert. As I mentioned in the title, this unit works fine, it's just very difficult to setup on a Windows 7 computer. Instructions do come with this unit for W7, however they are far from coherent and tell you to install things that are not included. So after spending hours performing an online search, I finally found what I needed to setup this unit on my computer. It works fine, it just should NOT be this hard and time consuming to setup."
5,Works great!,Easy to install and well worth the money. We have no signal once we step inside our camper. We purchased this and instantly have full signal strength!
3,Usb Antenna booster,This has been an ok product. I have been experiencing it randomly dropping signal. There wasnt much for a users manual describing features.
1,No Toll free customer service numer.,"No Toll free customer service number. Amazon doesn't have one for them either. Their item is designed to help to connect to internet, but there's no way to connect to them for tech questions."
1,doesn't pick up any more signals than my normal wireless,doesn't amplify or pick up the other signals around me does not extend range to signals less than a quarter of a mile away
1,the wireless in my Dell inspiron worked just has well as this item!!!! waste of my $$$$ money!,Waste of my $$$$$$$ money....the wireless in my Dell laptop worked just was well!!!!!
2,"works as described but with ""head dizziness""",The Alfa AWUS036H does what it is intended to do: in my laptop with windows 7 it can increase one or two lines the signal and get new ones. Unfortunatelly I won't be able to use it as it hurts my head: I feel something rare in my head whenever i turn it on. I haven't tried with a longer connector so that it is positioned more than 10 feet away: perhaps this might be of help.
5,Get all the Bars,Went from 2 bars in the red on my laptop to 4 green. Couldn't be any better and I didn't have to use the longer antenna.
2,Alfa has disappointed me,"If you are like me and in Security Consulting field you need tools like this for pen-testing and so on. Using this with backtrack 5 with reaver, aircrack, cowpatty and I am sure another program I am not remembering at this time I have yet to get it to work correctly. The signal on this one is weaker than my laptop internal wifi antenna. I even used a windsurfer sail to boost the signal of the antenna and not much help there. Going to have to buy a newer more expensive model that is compatible with windows and linux. Not just linux."
2,WI-FI antenna,"I'm not impressed by the result of this unit. Increased reception by about 10% no more. The installation was also somewhat not to clear. Altogether, I would not recommend this to anyone. Laptop antenna does the job just as well. 40$ spent for nothing."
2,I think it might work,"I have Dell Inspiron 2200, with windows XP Service Pack 3. Installation went smoothly and so did setup, but when everything was said and done, my computer still would not connect to the network, I think it might be the operating system of my computer. I really don't know, the computer showed ""Very Good - Excellent"" network connections, and 24-54mb connection speed, but the data would not flow. Packets would be sent, barely any received. I hear it works well with Vista and Windows 7, but I would stay away from this product if you have service pack 3 for Windows XP"
4,A Valuable Addition to the field of Hawaiian History,"I recently picked this book up while visiting Hawaii. It is very interesting and it is nice to learn about such new additions to Hawaiian history are becoming available. Dukas makes an excellent presentation of Hawaii's military past from its days before Kamehameha the Great's Unification of the islands, through the troubled years of the Kingdom and ending in brief years of the Republic. Extensive bibliography. Hopefully this will be the first of many historical works that will shed more light onto the years of the Kingdom of Hawaii and show it in a far more positive light than critics continue to portray it."
5,A Panhead Must,"This is an Awesome Skillet album. It defies the 2nd LP with the fresh, heart-quenching, punch-packing sounds of Invincible's Electronica! IT IS A PANHEAD MUST! Buy it now you will thank me when you do."
5,The best Bomberman and DS game!,"The game goes back to Bomberman's roots with 2D levels and a new feature that allows you to store your power-ups and use them later. But the game is more focused on the multiplayer mode,I'll state the facts-2 to 8 players using only one game card!-Over 100 stages to battle in,each one spanning over both screens-Over 30 multiplayer modes! (some taking advantage of the DS's microphone and others letting players race aginst each other to the finish line-Be a part of the battle even after you die by throwing bombs into the playing fieldSo as you can see,this is definatly one of the best games that the DS has to offer and shouldn't be missed."
5,"If you own a 3D tv, get this movie","I've watched several 3D blu rays at home, this movie now sits as the standard for how 3D should look. Visually the film looks stunning. There's lots of great 3D effects and unlike some other films, the 3D actually enhances the film to give the world it's based in a complete look and feel."
3,Not bad,I bought this for my grandson who likes animal movies but this movie was much more violent that I expected. It had a good story line and great graphics. But definitely for teens and up.
1,Parental abuse,"Why would a father tell his son fascinating stories aboutsuch a ghastly place called the grove? Especially whenits obscene activities are kept clandestine. It's certainlyno place for a youngster and such stories would only enticeand set their imagination on fire. And that ""Great Tree""certainly gets hot too. So, the nave youth set out to findthe Ammonite god, but not to ask it unwise questions like,""How many licks does it take to get to the Tootsie Rollcenter of a Tootsie pop?"" or ""Who has those easily swayedvessels jumping through hoops at Hooters?"" but to seek helpin defeating the evil Pure Ones. If the Pure Ones are evil,is that to say that the Impure Ones are good? It's likewatching lucifer and satan play chess.You would think a caring, nurturing father would warnhis offspring to steer clear from such noxious places,especially when the books of Zephaniah, Leviticus,I Kings, II Kings, and Jeremiah clearly warn us aboutthat disgusting sacrifice."
5,BEST 3D movie ever!,It is very difficult to find 3D movies period. So to be able to find Legend of the Guardians- Owls of Ga'hoole in 3D was fantastic.I loved watching the wind blow through the owls' feathers. I think the 3D effects are almost on par with Avatar.
3,"Nice, but not one I'd want to watch multiple times","Some nice animation, however I had something of a hard time visually telling the characters apart, and when they were in battle it was hard to tell which side was which at times as well. However, a nice story of bravery, courage and character.Not a movie I would like to watch multiple times though and I just don't see this being a favorite for the kids to watch either...but good to see once."
5,Fantastic Movie with great 3D effects.,My kids saw this movie at the theater in 2D awhile back and really liked it then. I purchased it in 3D and it was well worth it. My kids loved it all over again. I would definitely recommend adding it to your 3D library.
3,Disappointing,"Legend of the Guardians is a wonderful series of books by Lasky, but the movie was a great disappointment. While it was entertaining, the story is changed a great deal from the books. So much of the storyline is swept aside it is like a totally different story with the same charactors. It is best if you see the movie first without reading the books and then you will perhaps not be as disappointed. The books are fantastic and a quick and enjoyable read."
3,"Amazing Visuals, Rushed Plot","Really, cramming three whole books into one movie is NOT a good idea. The movie was rushed, details were wrong, the pure ones were NOT in control of St. Aggies at the start, Kludd and Soren did NOT fall from the nest, Kludd PUSHED Soren out, when that happened in the movie, I knew I was going to regret finishing it. And I did, the only good thing about this movie is the visuals, everything else is horrible, a place that took up about two books, took up about ten minutes, which made it horrible in my opinion, everything was far too rushed."
2,Mediocre boring film,"This movie its over-rated, the 3d effect its good but i think that despicable me and cloudy with a chance of meatballs are have better effects, and they are better movies too.I was bored the entire movie and wishing that ends soon, the characters are simple and do not have any charm, the plot have cliches and its not original, not a bad movie at all but i think that was a error have payed 30$ for this, i recommend save your money for better releases and better movies."
3,Average fair...,"The visuals were great. The story was not. Don't get me wrong, the screenwriter(s) tried to put a good story together. They had all of the ingredients but it never came together for me. Another in the long-line of great special effects and lack-luster story."
3,Legend of the Guardians,I liked this movie very much. Not for real young children asthey would not understand it. Maybe a PG13 movie.
5,Robinson Crusoe A Classic,"I originally purchased this DVD for my spouse for He use to watch it on television everytime it aired. He was estatic to find this golden movie to be finally released on DVD so I jumped at it to purchase it. The quality is outstanding what I don't understand is why is it so difficult to find in retail shops.An excellent piece of Sci-Fi work even from the era it was made in, it is highly recommended."
3,Way too much money for this movie,"I enjoyed this film in the theater and late Saturday night ""Chiller"" movies and it is fun and entertaining and thought provoking but $35.00!! No way."
2,Martian prices on earthbound flick,"This is a great film. BUT I will never pay Criterion's OUTRAGEOUS PRICES for OLD movies. Criterion is buying up the rights on old sci-fi and now a film that once cost about $9 is way over $25. This is profiteering pure and simple. Please don't buy Criterion's stuff, there are plenty of other old flicks out there....."
5,He Can't Wait to be a Daddy!,"I bought this book for our son as he awaits his first child. Wish the books were a pair...one for the mommy and one for the daddy, but since there wasn't a ""mommy"" one, I sewed our daughter-in-law a maternity top.He loved the book. In fact our son immediately e-mailed his dad for some fatherly advice about games, hobby activities, etc.The book is sweet, heart-warming, and beautifully illustrated. My only concern was that I felt there could have been a little more focus about the father-daughter relationship...it seemed sort of ""son"" targeted to me.Still, it's a beautiful gift for the father-to-be."
5,Good Book for Expecting Dads,I bought this book for my husband for Father's Day when he was about a month away from becoming a dad. Good book!
3,nice for steady waters,"My husband and I took this boat out in some calm waters and were fine. We also took it out in the Gulf by some real boats and got pushed around quite a bit. It's small, I don't think three people could possibly fit unless one is a small child. It's good to take in calm water where motor boats aren't going to be. For the price it's a good buy, hasn't gotten any holes and we've sat it down in some shelly sand and on concrete."
5,The next Revolution,"This is a very thought provoking look at the new world order. I like Siegel's analogy comparing the Web age to a tropical rain forest..""The New World is much more like a rain forest than the temperate forest. Residents of the rain forest are tribal- they band together, pack lightly, and can move on a moment's notice."" ""Compared to the temperate forest , the rain forest is a completely different world- dazzling in its complexity and ferocious in its pace of change. Diversity is the key to survival."" Siegel uses wonderful analogies that powerly demonstrate and explain his predictions for the business climate of the future. His insight is incredible but also very disturbing because if he is right, there will be a lot of grumpy old men from the old world order that will be forced to change to survive."
5,Best E-business Book to Date,"I found ""Futurize Your Enterprise"" to be a truly inspiring book. It has completely revolutionized my view of web sites and e-commerce. Siegel's writing style, excellent examples, chapter summaries and case studies make ""Futurize"" such a valuable business tool. Futurize will definitely be viewed and referenced for years to come. I look forward to joining the e-business revolution."
1,Save your dough for someone in the know,"Ugh. This guy couldn't write his way out of either paper or plastic. A real labor to get through. There may be some interesting and/or useful tidbits in here, but it's like looking for pearls in a river of chaff. I really wasn't overwhelmed by this guy's e-commerce chops."
2,"If you're looking for real insight, don't buy this book","David Siegel may have revolutionized the Internet industry two years ago with Killer App, but he totally missed the mark with Futurize Your Enterprise. Maybe it's just me but my expectations were very high. I was expecting to get insight into what eCutomers really want. Unfortunately, David only delivered warmed over principles.If you're looking for mind-blowing insight checked out the Cluetrain Manifesto."
5,Excellent!!!,Very well done - although it doesn't match Mikes Tom Tom blues!!! And yes we miss the old drummer - he is the best!
5,Under-rated rock treasure,"The 77's should be world famous.At first being foriegn to realy good music,I wasn't sure if I liked ""Drowning with land in sight."".After a few more listens I was hipnotically, trapped by the music.Like being trapped by a hundred pound annaconda wrapped around your throat,The 77's have an overwelming effect on me, but in a good way. The lirics are classic,for example the song ""Snake"",""I'm a highway wide and clear,I'm the french bread in the desert that you eat when death is near,I'm a snake.I stand tall when I crawl."" My favorite songs are the last two on the disc.But they are all my favorite songs. They paint pictures so beautiful and perfectly. This is the kind of good music I can listen to for hours."
5,Among the best Pasta cookbooks I have,"I love Italian cooking and this cookbook is among the best of the best that I own. Right now, i am making the pasta dish that sits for hours with chopped tomatoes, garlic, basil and s & p. Then I will add chopped fresh mozzarella with the hot pasta...oh my!!!"
3,For serious fans only,"This CD is from Manson's early Spooky Kids band, with the original version of my monkey. The track strange same dogma is very like dogma but with slightly different lyrics. The CD contains live footage of some early spooky kids songs, but unfortunately they don't give you the titles of the songs. The CD is worth it though, with tracks like Sam Son of man, my monkey and strange same dogma on the album. For serious fans only."
1,eh,this made it harder to apply the color on the ends because i have really long hair. It did help with mixing the dye and applying on my roots and bangs. I prefer just using rubber gloves in general though.
1,I found pieces of dead cockroach and other debris,"Well, I've used this product before without a problem so at first I thought, no problem, so a little harmless debris got into it, and didn't think much of the few specks I'd been finding. Another week passed, and the specks were more frequent, and beginning to bother me. One fine morning I found (meaning, spit out) what looked very much like a piece of the thorax of a cockroach. Obviously I could not continue using the powder. I'm disgusted just thinking about it. What the hell?"
5,Surprisingly Yummy!,"This tastes like vanilla cake batter to me which was a delightful surprise!I use it as a reward for completing less enjoyable nutritional tasks.""Now you know once you drink your alfalfa juice, you can have a little colostrum."""
4,Spirituality Meditation,A good book to use to meditate on the teachings of the church and how it deals with our daily lives
1,"My Baby Sam Wall Hanger Letter I, Solid White","I ordered letters to spell out my child's name. I received the this letter ""I"" in a separate box than the rest and it was dirty and chipped. Then when I received the box with the other letters there was duplicate ""I"" in place of one of the other letters I needed."
1,Not worth it,You can get a PAIR of gauged earrings for the exact same price these people are charging for A SINGLE earring. Even at expensive places with just as cool designs as this- like hot topic and other places online. Just not worth it when you realize they are 25 dollars a piece.
2,More of a TV movie feel than an opera,"I heard Anna Netrebko perform the first aria of this opera on a Youtube video of a Sommer Nachtmusik and it was amazing -- with life and fire that is unbelievable. In searching for a recording I could buy, I bought this video. I never got past the first aria with Anna Moffo, it is unbelievably lifeless and silly. and what I saw of the video seemed more like a TV movie than an opera. It is not her voice that is the problem it is the pacing and the direction with dialogue over the singing, but I do believe Anna Netrebko's performance is also much better as she breathes much more life into it. I eventually found that Anna Netrebko included the same aria on her Souvenirs album and bought it. I challenge anyone to compare her performance to this video and still rate it highly. I never got past the first aria."
3,shades for f150,"it's OK, on one front shade, the tip was broken, but it still worked,because of the 3m tape, not worth the trouble, or money on returns."
2,A head clobbering.,"Streamers beware! Here's a derivative experimental film featuring meandering bits and pieces of feminine trauma after a roadside accident. There're lots of references to the groin, body fluids, oil and gasoline. You'll be wondering what the point is and why it's so unoriginally avant-garde. It will be tedium personified for anybody who's had to wallow through many a film-school project. Sadly, it's too smarmy to enjoy even while abusing any number of substances."
4,Great album from a band you don't know that disappeared off the face of the Earth,"When people tell me they want to hear something new and obscure, THIS is one of the bands I consistently recommend. The only thing that baffles me is that these guys did not put out another album, and it's a shame because what you hear here is the sound of a band that should have gone places. It's so well balanced and well played that you just have to scratch your head as to their whereabouts unless you live in NYC and can get to random shows on a regular basis. Standout tracks are ""everything under the sun"", ""salome's wish"" , ""cassius clay"" and of course, the very impressive title track, ""headrush"" . By the way, the only reason I gave this a four is because this is not music you HAVE to listen to before you die, but it'd be a shame if you missed out, so don't risk it."
5,Awesome Juice,I love V8. It looks and tastes mostly like tomato juice but it's really a vegetable juice because it contains more than just tomato juice. V8 is very tasty and refreshing as a beverage - and it even works as a snack. A nice tall glass of V8 will give you a healthy way to tide you over when you feel a little hungry between meals.V8 hot and spicy is my favorite flavor. I love spicy food and this V8 flavor has a real nice kick to it. The only problem with V8 is I have to keep myself from drinking an entire 46 ounce bottle in one sitting.
5,Great source for WW recipes!,Weight Watchers provides us with a great number of good recipes. The best thing going for Weight Watchers is their low fat recipes do not taste low fat. My husband and I have lost about 20 lbs with their program. We have never been disapointed in any of the recipes in this book. You do not have to be on the program to enjoy their recipes. For us WW folks ever wonder what you can do with 6 points? Well this book will help you!
2,Need for proof-reading,"Even though it has a little bit of information on a lot of topics, it really just glazes over subjects and misses information. Misspelling, punctuation .... where was the proof reader before this was sent to print?? Information missing on formulas's .... so you are left to guess on what and how much to use. I was very disappointed. Just not enough information."
4,A good overview for the layman.,I liked the scope of this book and the clear helpful illustrations. I found it very informative. It covers a wide range of antiques and collectibles. Good basic information for the average collector and general repairs.
4,nice smooth cd,"I have never heard of him, them whatever..I just bought it after hearing Odie King on a Tyler Perry movie. The sound is a combo of Prince, Blial, Lenny Kravitz...its just smooth and funky combined. I love #5,6,7 and 12 for sure. Try it!"
3,"Well, let's wait for the next...","Robben Ford is a beautiful guitar player. He has a special technique but someone must tell him he's not a singer! That's the reason why he's made his fame: his best albums are instrumentals. It doesn't mean you don't have to buy this record, but be sure it shows no superb track."
1,Creep,I've been to the Philippines. My wife was Filipina (she passed away at 43 from cancer) The people & the country are beautiful. A middle class guy could live like a king. The creep that wrote this book could not get laid in a whore house. Why such a young girl? What on earth can you talk about? If you go to the Philippines and cant meet a nice girl somethings wrong. Creeps like this gives as all a bad name.
3,unique book,"I found that the way the book was told was good. The topic of the book was a great topic. But, I found the authors vison of life is tainted. Buying items for love and more. He does write it in a way however to show each action from diffrent views. But I found many actions exploitive and immoral. With out giving out much of the book it does make a good book of what not to do. Overall do get this book, but just understand that you might find this book at times offensive. Yet very informative and unique."
1,"Dont waste your money, dont waste your time.","In my opinion, this book is a complete disaster. I'd say it is a perfct example of what not to do when encountering other cultures. I managed to make it only to page 42 and finally just threw the damm thing in the trash. I don't know the ending to this sad tale, I only hope that the young lady he courted doesn't end up stuck in a foriegn country all alone. Knowing what I know now I would not buy this book again because I was expecting good information about what to expect, instead I was exposed to diatribe about what is wrong with women."
1,It deserves negative stars....,"This book took me all day to read. As I turned each page I became more and more disgusted with his constant feeding of his sex drive and his lack of consideration for her family traditions. He got her into bed before marriage after promising not to, disregarded her parents rules of not laying together in their house, ditched the chaperon which is also a no-no and that is just to name a few. He seemed only concered with himself and what he wanted. She was always made to apologize after their arguments regardless or whether or not she was at fault. Sure she was spoiled, but maybe she learned it from watching him. I am glad she went crazy in the end. He deserved it. What a horrible book about a man fulfilling his wet dream."
5,A Wonderful Lotion,This is the best body lotion I've ever tried. It is so creamy but does not leave a greasy residue. It absorbs quickly and leaves a nice scent. It's just great for winter skin and does a fabulous job on my hands. No more of those little cuts that often appear on fingers and are so painful. The grapefruit lotion is also wonderful. I love the Hugo products.
2,What a disappointment....,"I bought this mower because I thought it was a waste to hire a gardener to mow my tiny San Francisco lawn (it's maybe 15'x20'). It was easy to assemble (though one of the bolts fell out because I hadn't tightened it enough--doing it by hand is not tight enough). The first time I used it, I thought I was going to throw out my back, but I attributed it to the fact that the grass had grown pretty tall (high enough to use a line trimmer). But I just tried using it after hiring a professional to mow it a week or two ago, and it still was backbreaking work. I consider myself a strong person (220 pounds), but I could barely get the thing to budge. Maybe it works if you mow every few days and don't let the grass get too tall. But as for me, I'll probably never use it again.Anyone want a cheap hand reel mower???"
3,Nice Manual Mower,Not that perfect. well constructed. good for short grass and very small backyards or it will take you ages to finish a good size yard. but after all it'll do the job.
2,sub par,"Very disappointing. Missing parts, wheel fell off, handles tore up, all during the first use."
4,Good mower,"Easy to use, easy to assemble. The one and only small drawback is that you have to either go fairly slowly or push it in small swathes at a time to get every last blade of grass. As with any mower of this type it's also necessary to pick up any sticks or debris before mowing or they get caught in the reel. Great value for the money!And no nasty fumes or need to buy gas or electric for it."
4,Very nice mower,"Very nice reel mower for small area mowing. You have to mow regularly though, because it is difficult to push through high grass. The blades came sharp and cut great. It does not mow very close to objects due to the wheel spacing from the blades so additional weed eating is necessary. All in all...great purchase and exactly what I was looking for."
1,perfecttiming,"This mower is for townhome's and condos only. If your yard is over 60' by 60' feet, you need a different mower. Don't let the grass get to high or mower is hard to push. Also, you must cover lawn several times because it leaves strips here and there that didn't cut. I wonder if they even sharpened the blades? I wouldn' buy this product unless your retired and have a very small lawn."
1,Absolute junk,"Just purchased this lawn mower, and spent an hour assembling it. (BTW watch out you don't lose a finger on the blades as you try to attach the handle). After putting it together, tried mowing small patch of grass about 3-4 inches high. Worst job I have ever seen of cutting grass. Didn't even really cut it -- just tore it. I adjusted blade height to both extremes, and it made no difference. It cuts about 12 inches worth of ground, then chokes. I'll have to go the the store and buy a small electric mower, I guess."
1,Thirty Variations of Truth or Dare,"This book should have been called ""Thirty Variations of Truth or Dare"". Most of the games are just slight variations of each other. Not at all what I was hoping for. The title and cover are the most provocative part of this book."
3,interchange,"For the cost I was expecting more that I got. It is a small book. As well as, a lot of the answers aren't given, just that answers will vary, with no examples. I was disappointed in the book as a resource."
5,Excellent Toy!,My son is obsessed with this adorable toy. He carries it around with him all over the house. Even his daycare center asked me to get one for them and all the kids loved it!
5,Like a 3D Puzzle,"We received this item for Channukkah this year and it was the only gift my two year old daughter wanted to play with. She absolutely loves it for she can light the candles indepedently without worries of getting burned. She asks us if we are ready to light the candles and she gets her menorah and does it all by herself. She receives great pride and confidence from this item. It's great pretend play, which makes this item fantastic. It's like a 3D puzzle, which she enjoys for extended amount of time. A must have for your household."
4,Dakoda Motor Co. - Welcome Race Fans,"This album is a very good piece of music! Dakoda Motor Co. is not one of the most popular christian groups ever, but they are still a great band.The instruments, which has a rock-grunge kind of sound, along with a country twang, blends with the cool lyrics and the singer's voice (she has a nice voice, and sometimes a man sings).My favorite tracks are 'Alive' (no, not P.O.D.), 'Uglier', and 'Where Did It Go?'."
1,This Sucks.... Only One Special Feature,"When I bought this DVD on July 3rd which was a Sunday, I noticed that I saw only commentaries, compared to the first boxed set which had more than one special feature.I never listen to the commentary on the discs because you would hear talking in the background while you are trying to hear what the characters are trying to say.My overall rating of the episodes are 5 stars, but the special features rating as you know is 1 star because of the one feature, just like you all complaining about the short releases of The Simpsons.PS: DO NOT WRITE BAD REVIEWS IN THIS SPECIAL FEATURE REVIEW."
1,TOTALLY CUT (not uncut),UNCUT .....AH BALONEY!!This is nothing like the orignal episodes. Scenes cropped then cut and left laying on some editors floor somewhere.Once more its closed captioned (I'm deaf) nobody close captions DVD anymore due to the popularity of SUBTITLES. Subtitles are easier and cheaper to produce on a CD rather than CC encoding. So lame. But then again seeing as the product is made in mexico this doesn't surprize me. 99% of all the DVD I see come out of mexico are of such sub standard quality that you'd think they made DVD's out of old garbage can lids down there.In as much as I really like thr antics of Ren and Stimpy I just cannot justify paying for the LIE that this product is. UNCUT? HARDLY!THEY DID MAJOR SURGERY ON REN AND STIMPY.DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON SUB STANDARD PRODUCTPowdered Toast Man will have his revenge on the twerps who produced this DVD collection
1,Skip this book if you read French.,"This over-long book is strong on atmosphere and weak--very weak--on writing and character development. Anyone who reads French will be amused (and annoyed) by the frequent errors, the result of authorial or editorial sloppiness (""pastiches"" for ""pastis,"" ""comme"" for ""comment,"" and many, many others). Verb tenses are mangled, and incorrect accents are common (""créme"" instead of ""crème brulée, for example). Correcting the errors might be a good final examination for someone wishing to earn a degree in French! It's a sad commentary on the book's characters that the most endearing is the poodle puppy Petit Four."
2,Murder a la Carte,"It is an OK mystery. Not the best, not the worst.Though, I would not buy any more books by the same author."
4,Great!,"I have an old red one exactly like this. I bought this to keep at home and have the red one for work. The red one is better, the blue one has a funny feel to the dial. The volume control knob feels different too. They are just sloppy feeling. It tunes into AM and FM stations just fine. Like tuning the radio one direction, either the indicator will stick at the top or the bottom. I'd buy another one again though! If you are looking for a small portable battery op radio, this is perfect! The solar panel really makes the battery life last! I still plug it in rather than wind it, but seriously, I listen to this thing every night, and fall asleep listening to it. So its on at least 7 hours a night, and leave it close to a window during the day, and a single charge will last no less than a month! When it finally does die, I plug it in during the day and thats it! BUY IT! cant go wrong!"
2,YAWN!!,"I agree with Paul B21 -- I've been a Weckl fan since his early days and, of course, respect his mass quantities of talent but his music lately is all technique and no feel. Sure, he plays in the pocket but the compositions all just seem to be so mechanical and pre-fabricated. Even his live shows that I've caught lately had me restless to go home early and put on something that Vinnie plays on. I also saw Weckl perform live with Mike Stern and he was better but nowhere near as good as Dennis Chambers was in the same seat a year earlier. There are plenty of drum shredders out there but, let's face it, drumming is boring if it doesn't have the soul. Go pick up Karizma's ""Document"" to hear what great live drumming is all about."
2,Over priced,"I did not see any help of this book it might be just me, but this book does recommend other books that might be good I haven't read it."
2,Color didn't match,"Bought this marker because another brand was no longer available, it didn't match at all and the marker wore out really quickly."
5,Great Stroller,"It is very good, I recomend It completly, it is really lightwinght and very easy to fold"
3,Good intro to XML -- XSL info is obsolete,"This is a very good introduction to XML. However, I bought the book because it was the only one I could find that covered XSL. Unfortunately, XSL seems to have changed completely since this book was published. After reading the book I looked at the spec and found a completely different syntax. IE5.0 supports the spec and not what is documented in this book."
4,A very good startup book.,"This is a very good tutorial for XML and good startup book. This book handled the DTD part in detail. This book came to handy, when I was studying XML usage in our projects then."
1,Where is my DVD?,"Despite a huge delivery time window (nearly 3 weeks), I still haven't received the DVD I ordered, a week past the latest date in the delivery time window."
4,tender Mercies,I like Robert Duvall and this was one of his earlier ones. I enjoyed it. Good story. I would recommend it to Duvall fans
4,The single scariest game I have ever played,"I'll start this review by simply saying: This is the single scariest game I have EVER played.You're in a castle being stalked by some giant weirdo that tries to kill you, and the only way out is to hide. The gameplay revolves around exploring the castle for a way to advance and escape alive, but occasionally the inhabitant of the castle will try to kill you. You have a dog with you, that can help distract the enemy long enough for you to escape, but you're practically useless in actual combat. There is no way to fight back. Just run. Thankfully, there is always some sort of way to know if the enemy is near (these will-o-wisp or butterfly type things, I don't really remember what exactly they are) appear sometimes, and the music stops. When the music stops, it's time to run and hide. Hopefully your dog hides too.Recommended, for those that want a scare."
2,Book review,I do not think that the book was especially helpful to me. Perhaps it is just me but knowing what I know now I would not purchase the book.
5,Don't worry - it's easy to push!,"I think many people believe these kinds of mowers are difficult to push but I am happy to say it's not the case. I'm not a strong woman and I have no problems and our yard is neither tiny nor huge. I think it's about .25 acres and I don't break a sweat. In fact, I think it's fun! It's almost a zen-like experience. I've only had the mower a couple weeks and have only used it twice but so far so good and it seems to be very well constructed."
1,sounded rusty,"The mower was hard to push from the start. However, after I mowed the front yard with help from my daughter (we took turns because it was so hard to push), the next day I tried the back yard and overnight the lawnmower became even harder to push and made a loud, grinding noise when pushed. I think something was missing from the mower, like ball bearings or something."
5,"Awesome yard, easy to use and great exercise","I purchased this because I always wanted one as a child. My parents never thought much of them. I recently decided to try it while my husband was out camping with boy scouts. WOW! It's everything I imagined and more. Not only is it easy to use and lightweight, but the yard is looking better and better with each cutting. I've been using it for about a month now. The benefits: easy to use, very little storage room required, quiet, can mow in the rain or when grass is still wet, excellent workout. In fact, I am an overweight, 44 year old woman and this is one of the best motivaters for exercise I have found. If you don't mow the grass, it gets too long to work. Also, not only are you getting a good workout, you get a great looking lawn also! You can see the fruits of your labor being cut from the lawn and you get fit also.I didn't realize people would purchase these to save gas, but that's another added benefit. Go green! Go fit! Go motorless!"
2,Big Time Caveats,"I've had many gas powered mowers in the past, but since I now have a smaller lawn I wanted to go green. I seriously considered the Brill but could not justify the cost, maybe I should have. This mower would probably be best on a perfectly flat lawn, but I was not granted one so I usually have to double cut it. I have had this for just over 2 years and have to say it does just an OK job, but what really ticked me off is the fact that the handle is a POS, both sides cracked within minutes of each other and no amount of duct tape would fix it. Thankfully my dear old dad had an old reel mower (probably 50 years old ) and I was able to take the handle off and bend it a little to fit this one. The new handle is made of steel and not cheapo aluminum and should last a good while."
1,WORTHLESS IN FLORIDA,The good is that it was easy to assemble.The bad news is that it is worthless on my Florida lawn.It will not cut Bahia shoots and the St. Augustine grass is too thick for it.I tried to call the #800 customer service line for suggestions at least six times but the line was always busy.
5,Go Green!,"This is a GREAT product! It's quiet, lightweight, easy to operate and very efficient. Best of all, it doesn't require gasoline or electricity to run - just good old-fashioned elbow grease."
4,"Cuts grass good, gives high intensity work out","This mower cuts through grass very nice, when properly sharpened and adjusted. It also chokes on a toothpick, so clean up your yard before mowing.I am likely one of the few knuckleheads who successfully sharpened and adjusted the cutting bar on this machine, it took 3.5 hours...and I hated every minute. I used valve grinding compound and a jury rigged crank. It will take less time, now that I understand the cutting bar action vs. the set screws, which are a complete mystery at first.The BEST lubricant for the blades is synthetic motor oil, bar none.Ive tried lithium axle grease, EP moly grease, brake grease, antiseize, WD40, siicone spray, and nothing keeps the blades turning smoother than synthetic oil. It also stays on longer, and most effectively prevents rust on the blade edges,This thing also takes so much effort to push in heavy grass, it can get you in shape for a decathalon."
5,Best money spent,"I am a 58 year single woman who just had a shoulder replacement. My friends thought me crazy but I love it! I put it together this morning in a snap and went to try it out. I have a double lot so it was wonderful being able to mow a bit at a time without worrying if my mower would start up again. It is light and easy to push. I did get twigs stuck a few times but the wonderful part was fixing it and moving on,,,,,Best 100.00 I have spent in a long time!!! No gas, no noise, and helps this earth.....and me!!!"
3,"Works fine, not great","I bought this mower because I didn't want to deal with gasoline and the heavy weight of a power mower. Also because I'm cheap and figured this was a way to spend less on my lawn and get a workout at the same time. My lawn is not too large, maybe 20 x 50 feet. The grass is fairly soft and thin. The mower cuts most of the grass reasonably well, but because the grass is soft and thin, it will sometimes miss blades that get pushed down by the wheels. This means I sometimes have to come back through with a rake to get the grass to stand up high enough to cut. When I'm done mowing, it never gets that really clean look that a power mower will give you. Maybe it's just something I have to get used to.The blades frequently jam on small twigs, which is a bit of a pain. To clear the jam, I tilt the mower sideways until it dislodges. I also wish the blades got closer to the edges of the lawn. Looks like I'll need to also buy an edger."
3,Buy a cordless mower instead!,"This mower is as easy to push as a power mower but it does not do a good job of cutting the grass evenly. It leaves single tall blades of grass scattered everywhere. I figured I may be doing something wrong so I tried different walking speeds and wheel height adjustments but still ended up with the same bad results. It is good exercise. I would not recommend this mower for anyone who wants their lawn to look nice after a mowing because it won't. This mower will cut most of the grass so it will keep you out of trouble with code enforcement. I am ordering a cordless mower today from Amazon after only three cuts with this Scotts one. What a waste of money this was. Also, it was not easy to put together. If you're going to tough it out with this mower I suggest you lubricate it before each cut to make pushing it a little easier."
4,Lives up to my expectations,"I was hesitant about making this purchase because of the experience I had with an ancient model when I was a kid. The blades spun just as fast as the wheels when you pushed it and was very hard. The Scotts Classic is geared so the blades spin much faster than you actually push the mower. Its light frame makes it easy to push across my yard, I don't have to wear a dust mask anymore, and don't have to wear ear protection like I did with the gas mower. The mower and myself stay a lot cleaner because it doesn't kick up dust like the gas mower will, and it's just a nice experience to mow the lawn and still be able to hear birds and other sounds of nature rather then the roar of a motor."
4,Mostly good - if you keep up with it!,"I bought this mower one year ago for environmental concerns. I was moving to our new house from an apartment, and had a chance to start fresh with all environmental lawn equipment.After one year of use, the push mower has met most of our needs. The trick is that any weeds that get about 3"" or so start to become trouble. Anything below that is not much trouble at all, and it cuts evenly.Anything above 3"", I've tended to have to get out the weed whacker or pull them manually. That gets old fast.I have been cutting our lawn by doubling back over each row, and typically every couple weeks I will do a full cross-cut in a thatch pattern.I love the lack of noise, I love the environmental benefits. But this mower IS going to be more work unless you mow at least a couple times per week, please don't fool yourself into believing otherwise!"
4,Not for everyone,"Before I bought this I read other reviews and they were very helpful in not expecting too much on this product. I love having it but there are many times when a power mower is still necessary. And it requires a lot of preparation to remove any leaves or twigs that it can't handle. Also, you have to mow more often becaue if you let the lawn get too long it can't handle it. Also, my lawn is not thick so I'm not sure if it could handle a really thick, lush lawn. I like that I am not using gasoline and that I get more of a workout when I mow. I've used it for one season and had no problems. The cover on the handle looks like it will wear out fast. I regret buying the grass catcher - it is not necessary since you can't wait to mow when it is too long."
2,Half done job,The cutting portion of the mower seems well built and solid. The handle and arms of the product are terribly weak. Why would any engineer design such a poor quality handle? The product is only as good as its weakest link and the handle scores a minus 2 and the mower scores a plus 4 giving a net score of plus 2.This could be a great product with just a little more thought put into the design of the handle supports.
2,Get a real mower with gas and self propelled.,There is a reason why we stopped using 'reel' mowers many years ago. We should learn from history rather than repeat it. Buy a used 'real' mower from Sears. They cost just as much as this mower.
3,Not what I expected.,"I like the light weight of the mower, how sharp the blades are and how compact it is for storage. However, it doesn't cut grass that is any taller than 4 inches (just bends it over) and doesn't cut sparse grass. It works great in thick areas. I wanted to adjust it so it'll cut herbs in a stone pathway, but it's quite complex to get at the axle to do so. I'm sticking with it because I'm trying to help our environment, it's much quieter than a power mower, and it's good exercise."
4,"Works great under 3"" of grass height","I recently purchased the 20"" Scott reel mower. It works really well as long as your grass is under 3"" high. Does not work well on buckhorn or dandelions which sprout up really fast. Quiet operation, easy to use. I would recommend this product for those who intend to maintain their lawn on a regular basis."
3,OK' But not as good as expected,I purchased this based on other good reviews' Probably my expectation is too high' It won`t replace the traditional lawn mower'
5,So glad I took a chance!,"When my power mower broke (again) I explored the idea of a push mower. I liked the fact that so many people reviewed this item-- it's something you don't get at the local stores. I took the plunge and have been using the mower for two weeks now. It's great! Our house is on a moderately sized hill and this mower is lighter than our old gas mower and is so easy to maneuver that I never want to use anything else. The reviews that said a few extra passes are needed because of the width of the mower are true, but it's absolutely worth it. Don't ""what-if"" this purchase any more, just do it!"
2,"good idea, poor materials","I have owned the Scott's reel mower for 3 years. My yard is a little over 1/2 acre, so I get a good workout with it. I like the idea of a reel mower, but have had problems with the Scott 20 inch. I have gone through 3 handles, one a year. The quality of the metal is very poor. The mower does ok otherwise, but I tire of having to order replacement parts every year. If someone could actually make a quality mower that holds up I would really appreciate it.For now until my new handle comes in I'm back to my gas mower."
3,Good basic mower,"I have many trees in the area, so my lawn has a lot of twigs. This mower does a good job of plowing through. It gets unstuck easily.It is excellent exercise."
1,"Exercise equipment, not for mowing","I have mowed with this mower 4 times now, and each time I have to go back through with my weed eater to cut down the longer blades. It gives a jagged cut that looks terrible. It refuses to cut some blades of grass no matter how many times you try to mow it. It's great for exercise, but bad for mowing."
1,Poor option in general,"I have a large lawn--about 1.15 acres--and was looking for a cost effective option to help with a very small patch of grass that was too small for my wide deck (i.e., 52 inch) riding mower. Basically, I was looking for something to help mow under a children's swing set and around some landscaping. After much research I settled on the Scotts 2000-20 20-inch push reel. I ordered one from Amazon at a price of about $75. The box arrived after 2 days (prime subscription) and the item was easy to put together. I read prior reviews and was fully prepared for a ""work out"" when using this item. However, the push reel constantly locked up, and I spent 2-3 hours trying to get it to work with no luck. I also contacted Scotts for help. In the end I returned it. I would not recommend this item for any size lawn."
2,Not useful on St Aug grass,"I read several reviews about how well this mower worked in most grass types, to include St Augustine. When I pushed mower thru moderate height grass, only about 75% of the grass blades were cut. I knew it would not cut weeds, but I expected a good cut on my grass. I am sending mower and sharpener, which I no longer need, back and will go back to my gas mower. I guess the birds will get used to the noise again."
4,Needed adjustment,"The instructions had stated that the lawnmower has been adjusted prior to shipping, however I could hardly push it. The blade was not turning easily. I had to re-adjust the blade for the lawnmower to work wihtout pushing so hard."
4,Works well. Go Narrower for Tight Spaces,"I've been very pleased with the quality of cutting by this mower. It provides a consistent look as long as you don't let your lawn get out of control. However, no push mower does well if you let your grass get too long.While the wide 20"" style may sound appealing, I wouldn't recommend going that wide if your lawn has a lot of things to maneuver around such as trees or curvy landscaping. It's much easier to navigate narrower models around tight turns. The handle on this model isn't sturdy enough to handle much other than back & forth mowing."
1,Barely Works,"I have owned this mower for several years. It never worked properly out of the box. The blades are not true no matter how much adjusting. There is a spot in the center where the reel just doesn't touch and thus, I must end up going over the lawn repeatedly. This thing is a pain in the rear. Also, you must religiously spray WD-40 on the blades after and sometimes during use to keep the reel somewhat easy to push.I went back to an electric mower."
3,Not good on Dandelions!,"I got this thing several years ago and in general it works pretty good. You have to have a bit more ""overlap"" than other mowers and it has problems with some of the grass and weeds we can't seem to get rid of. Dandelions (flowers and ""puffs"" just bend rather than cut. Other grasses seem to have the same problem.It works best if you use is OFTEN and keep the lawn cut short. If it starts to get long, then this does not cut well.It's also hard to push if you have a thick lawn whether it's long or short. Just cutting that much grass seems to take a lot of pushing!On the plus side - it's very quiet and very ""green!"""
3,Adequate Mower,"This mower preforms well for what it is, but I found it harder to push than a power mower, especially if you are going uphill. A free-wheeling power mower glides more easily. It is nice not to have to deal with gas/oil/fumes etc., or worry about starting, and those are indeed worthwhile points. Beware, not all the parts were in the package. They sent too many screws and not enough nuts. Had to go to a hardware store and purchase more. For that reason, will not rate it higher."
1,Saving Energy Is Exhausting,"I tried to do the right thing by buying a push mower, and I really hate the noise of a gasoline mower. Unfortunately, this product was a huge disappointment, and now I am going to have to buy a power mower after all. This mower skips and slides over the grass without cutting, so I have to go over the same spot three times to have any chance of cutting it. Even then it is pretty rough. In the end, it takes three times as long and five times as much personal energy to cut an area half as well. Of course, there is no trouble-shooting guide provided, and there is no hope of taking it to a service place, so the only recourse is to trash this item and waste whatever money was spent on it. Years ago I used to sell Scott products, and I thought they were reliable even if they cost somewhat more. No longer. Now it is just one more piece of junk trying to get by on a company's previous reputation. My advice: stay away from this one."
1,Not such a great idea,"I bought this mower thinking it would be great for the environment, economical and fun. I used the previous reviews as a guide and went for the purchase. Big mistake. If your grass is even a bit high, you can't push the mower. We tried adjusting the settings, but that didn't really help. Either the mower is too hard to push, or the settings are too loose and the mower won't mow. And, forget about pushing it up hill, which means if you live on a slope, you have to push the mower downhill, drag it up to the top, and push it down again. Not fun. The handle is too low, which makes it difficult to keep the wheels on the ground and the tray gets clogged, constantly stopping the blade from turning. This is probably the worst $99 dollars I've ever spent. I won't even try to sell it at a yard sale because I'd be ripping off the person who was attempting to buy it. For now, this mower is only good for decorating my garage."
1,Disappointed,I'm a little disappointed this reel will not cut dandelions or certain weeds. This fact is not stated in the advertisement but casually mentioned in the owners manual. Unfortunately I didn't see this fact until I had tried to cut my lawn with it or I would have sent it back. I tried to go green but this machine leaves a lot to be desired.
3,Works well but,It only really works when the grass is pretty short. If the grass is very tall you have to go over the same section many times. I would only recomend for a very small yard and for someone who wants to cut grass alot so they can keep it short enough to use.
2,Terrible for thick Kentucky Bluegrass,"If you have thick Kentucky Bluegrass, I'd avoid this one. It gets stuck and ends up tearing up your lawn. Also, it claims to cut as high as 3 inches, but it was absolutely butchering my grass at the highest level. I could see it working just fine on normal grass with no slopes as long as you mow at least once a week."
1,works great until the handle breaks,"I have enjoyed using my scott's classic lawnmower for 2 1/2 seasons on a very small lawn. However, the handle is really flimsy. Today was it's last day and so far I have been unable to find a replacement handle. I will soldier on with a duct tape repair for the balance of the season."
2,Think twice before you buy this particular mower...,"I received this as a gift for my house warming. I wanted to start off in my new house going green. The mower worked pretty well for the first year or so, but then it started leaving grass behind. Any kind of grass aside from zoysia or southern type of grass doesn't get cut and you have to go over it several times. It just wears you out.I recently got the blade sharpened and the blade height adjusted. It still isn't that good and leaves behind a lot of grass tall. Now I have to weed wack the remaining tall grass and it's just a hassle. I do care about the planet, and want to do my part, but I think I need to get rid of this and get something that works a little better.How about a rotary man powered mower? Why don't they make that?Or how about a reel type mower that cuts any type of grass?"
5,Too Good For One Movie!,"This has to be one of the best comedies of all time. Just check out the list of actors in this film, not to mention the characters, and situations the portray, all of them on their way to Florida for one reason or the other, all connecting in the town of Ticlaw. They could have made a sitcom of this movie and I'm sure it would have been on the tube for years. I first watched this on HBO in the 80s, taped it, and have enjoyed it ever since. You won't be disappointed."
3,Funny Florida,"Honky Tonk Freeway, for many years, held the record for losing more money than any Hollywood product in history. Having probably the worst, most ill-conceived title possible and no real star power, it was easy to overlook. The fact is, it's a funny movie. This isn't ""art"" and it doesn't pretent to be. But, if I have a choice of spending an evening with either Honky Tonk Freeway or Out of Africa, it's going to be the trip to Ticlaw, Florida for me."
1,Really? I'm re-thinking my faith in Amazon reviewers.,"I have never, in all the years I've quite faithfully trusted Amazon reviews, been so disappointed in a book I thought sounded good. Admittedly I'm not much of an ""airport fiction"" reader but this book took cheesy to an entirely new level.The characters are horrendously cliche, the writing is droll, and the storyline would barely be worth of a CSI script.There is, of course, some stupid pseudo-sexual tension amongst the two main police officers in the book which just put the cheesiness over the top.No offense to those who like this but this book will only appeal to people who like airport paperbacks and the crap you find on the $.99 rack at your local bookstore.I was going to give the book 2 stars just to be kind but am unable to stop myself from giving in 1-star. Writing this review makes me want the last 3 minutes of my life, plus the time spent reading the book, back."
3,"Energetic, but a bit samey","Duke Spirit is supposed to be the ""latest greatest"" emerging British band. Their songs are lively and highly energetic, the band is fun to watch (on YouTube, anyway). The down side is, I find I can't listen to the whole album without getting antsy. They're certainly likable, with a sound derived (to my ears) from Siouxsie and the Banshees. But all the same, the tracks fly by and are mostly indistinguishable from one another. A cut or two from Duke Spirit is a great way to spend a few minutes, but after that I start flipping through CDs looking for something else. ""Love Is an Unfamiliar Name"" is my favorite track, but if you don't like that one, well there are 14 more that sound just like it--take your pick. All in all, Cuts Across the Land has its charms, just not five stars worth of them."
2,Half the history of Scotland,"The two stars I gave it, are for the views and photography.What happened to Mary , Queen of Scotts, Wallace, Robert de Bruce, Queen Victoria, Culloden, Bannockburn, the Knights Templar, etc. So all was invented by a prolific poet and it is not real! Well, then tell us YOUR real Scottish History!!!Wasted money, I would have done better with a tourism DVD!"
3,Review,"I was expecting the milk frother to at least make the milk frothy, not just a layer or bubbles on top."
1,Save Your Money,"Having grown up in the Pittsburgh area in the Sixties, I was looking forward to a trip down memory lane. This book has very little information, very few pictures, and is poorly written. Other than fleecing the public, I wonder why Mr. Stohl even bothered to write this book with so little material to go on. He even writes in the books' forward that most of the film, people, files, have disappeared. It took me 15 minutes to read the whole book. Shame on you Hank Stohl."
2,"Good book, but it doesn't teach C#","I just finished reading this book cover to cover and I'm afraid I don't know C# much better than I did before I started. I am now an expert in using the (really cool and powerful) Visual Studio.Net Integrated Development Environment, but I hardly learned a thing about programming. So, if you want to be able to create cool applications by dragging and dropping and using menus, this book is great. If you want to have a clue about the code behind your applications and/or learn some lessons in Object-Oriented Programming, you'll need another book. (...)"
4,Just what I needed,"Exactly what I ordered, expected and wanted. I used it as an underground electrical junction box. Plenty Enough room to fish, pull and connect wires."
4,"Catchy, playful interplay","Yesterday--during the part of a road trip back when spirits begin to flag and all the responsibilities one has escaped start to flicker from the periphery of consciousness--from a three-day getaway, a friend handed me a CD he described a ""bass `n drum stuff.""He may have purposely understated the case, as we spent the next chunk of the trip back energized and refreshed by the catchy, playful interplay of Tussle on ""Kling-Klang."" I'm no expert on this genre of music, its key players, or its strictures and such, so I have little insight to offer in that regard.But if you need some music that envelopes you with a shimmering, trance kicked into overdrive by the bass/drums interplay and augmented by some minimal electronics and treatments that seem like the disembodied cries of luring sirens, then this CD fits the bill."
1,Rusty Truck is anything but rusty.,"Great cd. Imus in the morning recommended highly and the I-man was not wrong. One of the best cd's I've owned in years. I listen to a lot of Buffett, James Taylor, Delbert McClinton, and this cd places high in these ranks."
5,"Great Drink, Great Taste","Great Product. For those of you interested in taste, pretty much Pomegranate doest have that huge carbonation feel like other energy drinks do. My favorite thing about it is there is no crashing, kept me going for hours and slowly wears off without the whole i want my bed feeling afterwards."
2,"Bland, but contains no really bad information","This book isn't a terrible one, it explains the theory and practice of card counting. But, personally I found I knew most of this information, and even if you didn't, it would be better learned elsewhere (eg Ed Thorpe's original). The count system presented in the book has been surpassed by the popular, more powerful, and more simple, K-0 system. You continually get the unsettling feeling that the book is giving you outdated info."
4,excellent book for starters,good book written by a great person who had a lifelong experience in counting.
4,Blackjack as a Martial Art?,Tom Synder being the overconvident blackjack player and writer that he is updated his 93 classic but still does not stack up to the book Blackjack as a Business by Lawrence Revere. Read that one and then you'll know what blackjack is all about. Borashi
4,"Not bad, but not his best","Well, I have seen all of Mark Lowry's videos, and I love 'em all. I have to say that this one is his worst, but it isn't too bad. While all of his others get a 5 star rating from me, this gets a 4. It has some rediculous parts, and ""The Date Adventure"" is really stupid. I would not recommend this to someone who just wants one or two of Mark's videos, but if you have the rest of them, I'd add this to your collection. This would be my last choice, but it's still worth it."
4,Good Book,Gentle reminder - what you say is powerful. It was a good book to read and would be good to pass on to friends & family.
5,Just what I wanted,"I know what I have to do to improve my chess game - examine master games (and even annotating them and them comparing my annotations to GM annotations of the games), study the end game, play tournament length games and then study where my weaknesses were in the game, and so forth. And of course there is looking at two 'til mate ""puzzles"" and trying to discern what the mate is as quickly as possible. This book provides page after page after page of those puzzles, which is exactly what I wanted. It also has page after page after page of three until mate puzzles, but that's a bit beyond me currently. At my skill level, which is pretty low, it takes me anywhere from 2 minutes to 30 minutes to discover the two-until-mate problems in this book. My median average for solving these is 5 minutes.I also own the 100 Brilliant Ways to Checkmate book, which is good and compact, but it only has 100 puzzles - this book has thousands of them. It's just what I wanted."
3,"Intriguing, but a little dense","I read this as an english person with knowledge, via the media, of the Greenham Common events upon which it as based. I am male, which may be a disadvantage, given the radical lesbian feminist label it adopts, but I enjoyed the alternative perspective. Shall I be honest ? It is not her best. Lindsay and her pals are a bit irritating. the prose is overlong and tends to lose dramatic point as you meander around the, rather hackneyed, plot. But... hey, do not take that as criticism Val. I am enjoing what you are doing and place you in the Paretsky and Parker class when it comes to crime fiction. Maybe my scepticism derives from the fact that it is hard for us anglos to sound glib, hard-boiled etc. Apart that is, from Terry Venables, another once upon a time crime writer. Keep up the good work !"
4,"Fun atmosphere, fun tale...","While this novel may not be 100% believable, I did enjoy reading it. In true McDermid style, it employs tons of good natured wit and sarcasm. As an American whose never left the homebase, I was unfamiliar with some of the British terminology, and thuse found myself saying ""Don't be daft"" an inappropriate times after finishing this novel...Anyhow, I did like the character development in this book; without it, the book would have been purely mystery and sorely lacking!This is one of the better books in the Linsay Gordon series. If you liked the first one, you should check this one out."
1,Revelation? I think not...,"I am not impressed with Mr. Little. This is my second attempt at reading his material and I seriously wonder how this man ever got a book deal. ..... To sum it up, every 100 years the devil tries to come back to life and this time he targets a small town that harbors a secret sea of graves from unwanted/ill children. Basically, evil babies, big and small, dig their way out of the mass graves to mutilate adults and children alike until they bring back the devil to rule through the ""one"" child. The book is full of disfigured, oozing babies trying to take a bite out of anything that moves. Am I the only one who finds this absurd???? After a few of the townies start shooting giant, green oozing babies I came to the conclusion that Bentley Little books should be dumped into mass graves instead."
2,Mostly Junk,"Bentley's first novel is a good outline of his career that was to follow, in so far as his writing habits for longer stories are concerned - a good start, gratuitous sex and gore, paper thin characters and a very anti-climatic ending. Most of his longer novels are simply a journey from the promising to the disappointing, and ""The Revelation"" isn't any different.After a boring prologue and an interesting first half, the story falls apart and meanders it's way to a lame, easily accomplished ending for the main characters. By the time you get there, you've lost what interest you had in his characters and feel very detatched from their dilemma.I wouldn't recommend ""The Revelation"" to anyone. It's not his worst novel (that would be without any doubt ""The House"", followed closely by ""The Walking""), but this ranks pretty highly."
2,Revelation,"This book was an easy read, and had plenty of good parts, but like many other reviewers have stated, it was nothing like Bentley's later works. I can see where he was going with this, but near the end it seemed hurried, hollow, and a little too cheesy. It did, however, get me interested in Bentley Little, and I'm glad I continued to check out more if his books. The Store, especially, was awesome!"
4,very scary,this book is extremely scary and the suspense of waiting for something to happen is great i couldnt put it down he reads with the suspense of stephen king and is very similar to dean koontz but hes a bit more graphic in his depictions
4,A revelation in horror,"This is Littles creepiest book. The beginning sent shivers down my spine - literally. Although the very end is a small let down, the majority of this book holds firm and scared the sh*t out of me. There's more gore than one can handle, grisly imagery - it's simply mind-numbing.One thing that really works here is the atmosphere - most novels out there don't pack this much punch, that's for sure. It will have you looking over your shoulder before the night is through.Each character rang the realistic bell; good job here.Little stumbles sometimes, but all is forgiven by the time I came to the last chapter. Read this for yourself and see what I mean, but be warned - Little is not for the weak of stomach (or mind)."
2,Royal Dud,I bought this for my daughter a while back. The sensor had a tendency to go off whenever. We also had a problem with the sound startling her when it went off unexpectedly while she was using it. She would leap off the potty and pee on the floor. We ended up using the Royal Potty sans batteries. Eventually we found the ovals you can buy for $6 and put on the actual potty to be a better investment.
2,no worth the money,my son received this as a gift when we was 16 months old. my wouldn't even be sitting on it and it would turn on and make music. now that he does use it leaks. so now my carpet smells like pee.
2,I'm not thrilled but my daughter likes it,I have to agree with the other reviewers about this being more toy like than serious potty training. My daughter loves sticking her hand in the bowl to make it play the song and she loves taking the bowl out. There are times when she doesn't go and the music goes off which is confusing. I will probably buy another one just so she can distinguish the difference. Once she figured out she could make it play without going potty she quit using it.
1,Awful!,"My daughter hated this potty. We have to go buy another one. The sensor that tells when your child uses the potty is red, and she was so scared of it, she thought it was going to burn her little bottom!!! Also, the sensor turned itself on and off at seemingly random intervals. Frustrating-- it also set us back because she was so afraid of it."
1,the worst potty ever for boys,"this potty chair is the worst!!!!!!!!! Every time my son used it there was more pee on the floor then in the holder. Not only does it leak, but even worst my son being pulled down would get pee on them from the floor. Making him believe he did something wrong because I would have to change his cloths and he thougt he had an accident.DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY AND WORST YET IT WILL SET YOU BACK WITH THE TRAINING BECAUSE OF THE LEAKING. MAKING YOUR CHILD AFRAID OF USING IT BECAUSE IT GOES ALL OVER THE FLOOR!!!!!!!!!!!! I HATE THIS CHAIR AND IT SHOULD BE TAKEN OFF THE MARKET!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! In addition I wouldn't even give it one star but the review requires you to have to in order to place my review."
1,Not for active boys.,"My son is 2 1/2 and this potty has been a nightmare for us. First, it did have a tendency to go off at all times of the day and night, and 2nd, the splash guard is not tall enough or secure enough. I can't even begin to count the times that I've turned around and seen him chewing on the guard he's removed or how often urine has shot across the bathroom because his penis is pointing 1 cm off of 'straight ahead'. On the bright side, it's comfortable for him to sit on and mine has never leaked, but that just may be because the urine never quite makes it in the receptacle."
2,potty leaks pee...,"so gross. I bought this b/c several family members and lots of family friends work for Fisher Price. Not sure who designed it, but every time my son pees in it, it leaks all over the floor. And we do use the little pee deflector thing (for boys). Maybe it works for girls? And the little musical part has only worked maybe 2x and it freaked my son out. It looks very cute, but I'm tired of cleaning up a puddle of pee every time. We're switching to little seat that goes on the real potty."
1,Too leaky,"This is not a good potty, for boys at least. When my son pees, more ends up on the floor than in the potty. He seems to always be aiming right for this little opening between the seat and the bowl underneath. This is also not a comfy seat for when he's going #2 and is sitting there for a while! We have an Evenflo Training Rewards potty also and it is much better- rarely leaks and has a nice cushioned seat."
2,"more play, less potty",My little girl has decided that she rather kick it to make the music play rather than actually use it for what we bought it for then play with it and touch the light that goes on which I feel may be unsanitary. This is our third potty and we are now finding that she rather just sit on the actual toilet seat.
1,It's unfortunate that the bowl looks like a baseball cap...,"As my son started showing potty-readiness, I stood before the huge display of potties and thoroughly examined each feature and decided on this potty. How cool! It plays music! What a nice reward! Like other reviewers, I found my son quickly figured out what he could do to make the music, so he's constantly be sticking his hands down in the bowl which is a bit counter-productive. The worst feature for us is that my son thinks the bowl looks like a baseball cap... I assume that I don't have to paint this picture for you... let's just say that this is one potty we don't recommend. :P"
2,royal mess,"Firstly, my daughter did NOT like the music. Well, I shouldn't say that, she got so distracted by it she stopped doing her business, jumped off, and then peed or pooed in her pants about 10 minutes later. So, out went hte batteris and we had better success.I must also say that it leaks. I would not buy it again."
1,Leaks and the music encourages little hands,"The first thing my daughter did was stick her hand past the motion detector to make the music go off. I had to take the batteries out so the music feature was worthless. Then when she sat down to go, the pee went through the crack between the seat and the bowl, down the leg of the chair and into a puddle on the floor. There are so many crevices that it is impossible to clean, especially along the route from the crack between the seat and the bowl and down the leg of the chair. This thing is a JOKE. I am a sucker for buying."
1,THE POTTY LEAKS,"The reward chime was cute but oh so annoying ,I let the batteries run out and never replaced them ( mind you the chimes were the reason I chose this potty) OK and after my son finally got trained i noticed that everytime he went there was a huge puddle of urine on the floor, i am very disppointed with this potty and i am oh so ready to just toss it out and buy a cheap one that is practical and mess free. I say dont waste your money!!!"
1,[Bad] potty,"I bought this for my son thinking it was cute. It is cute, but that's the only postive thing I can say about it. The bowl and seat are way too small, and the arm rests come so far foward that there is no room for a child to spread their legs. The result (for a boy anyway) is the pee goes on the floor, or on you if you don't get out of the way quick enough! The music is inconsistant, it is triggered too easily so it is more of a distraction then an award. The little book constantly falls out of it's holder. But the worst thing is the bowl is pulled out from the front, making this a great play toy for a curious toddler, but not fun for mommy. My son keeps reaching between his legs and whipping out the bowl. Like many of the other mom's that have reviewed this, I am chucking this one and looking for a better model."
3,good...not great,"I bought this potty for my 2 and 3 year old boys. My 2 year old fits on the potty very well, however the opening and the height of the potty seems two small for my 3 year old. They love the music but the battery keeps dying. They figured out that if they stomp on the floor near the potty, then the light goes on. Now it is a game. The sensor only works if your child goes a lot at once. My 2 year old gets frustrated when he goes and the music doesn't play. I also have a problem with leaks, and I do make sure that the bowl is in snug. My children like to use the potty, and thats what really counts."
4,Leaky Mess = Smelly Bathroom,"I loved this potty because of its look and its easy to remove bottom makes for easy cleaning. My Son has about 4 different potties between ours and Grandmas houses and this is by far the easiest to clean! However, it leaks all over the floor. I solved this problem by purchasing an inexpensive (but cute) bath rug. I clean it every other day by taking it in the shower with me. The thinner the mat the faster it will dry when hung.Now my three year old likes to sit on the big potty, but with his ""boy equipment"" its hard for him to hold himself up and hold his equipment down. I removed the legs from the potty and it clicks right into the toilet seat. The leaking is no longer a problem! I would purchase this potty all over again...its worth the hastle."
1,Toddler Nightmare,Every time my daughter (20 months) uses the potty her first reaction is to pull the pan from under the potty...causing the floor to get wet. The pan comes out from the front...did they think about which age group would be using this potty?
1,Pee On The Floor,"Not for my 2 1/2 yr. old son. The deflector does not work for him and the pee goes in between the cup and removable tray. Leaving me with a mess every time. Also, the music sometimes just plays all be itself and is very annoying. I do not recommend this product."
2,Major Leakage,This potty leaks! My son only uses it while sitting down with the urine guard in place but after each use there is a large puddle of urine on the floor. Like a previous reviewer I studied it carefully (I am an engineer) and came to the same conclusion - the space between the bowl and chair is too great. Yuck!
1,The Owie Potty - Zero Stars!,"I was very disappointed in this item. I thought it would be fun for my son to learn with. He is small for his age (2 yrs old) and still the seat and the splash guard pinched him. The hole is the smallest I've seen on any potty and I'm not sure how any child could aim correctly, boy or girl. I was surprised when I pulled it out of the box.This is the first product review I've written but had to share because it was such a bad experience. I've been very happy with other fisher price products.My son is potty trained now and we used the Graco which was a great chair. It had no music but he didn't really get excited by the royal music because he would just cry ""No, owie potty - It hurts Mommy"". Not a good experience for a toddler.I hope fisher price reworks a good concept but bad product."
1,AWFUL,This potty is so awful i have a little boy who is 2 it doesnt even fit him... not wide enough hes not even a chubba :)The pee pee also does not stay in the potty because nothing lines up right. In my opinion it is flimsy and the pieces dont go together well.
4,A Pleasant Collection,"For some reason, I had thought this CD was new work. Instead, it is a compilation from Lanz's other CS's: a repackaged assortment of favorite tunes. As a ""sampler"" of other CD's, it is immensely enjoyable.Lanz collects favorite melodies which delight the senses. Some sound like a cross between Mannheim Steamroller and Yanni, but all-in-all, if you enjoy his finest original piano melodies, you'll enjoy this."
2,The POLITICAL history of Australia,"You get the idea in the foreword and on the back of the book that this is an all-encompassing book about Australian history. It is however nothing more than a summation of the policital leaders and what they did.Aboriginals are being spoken about in what probably amounts to a few pages in total. There is nothing on sports, personal life, art etc. if there is it is tied into what some Prime Minister did.It seems a little right-wing history to me, only focused on the leaders and their policy but I don't think you'll get a better understanding of Australia when you read this book."
5,Doing my part!!,Moving into my house three years ago I made a choice to start doing the right thing by buying organic food and eco-friendly cleaning supplies. I have been very happy with this product and encourage everyone to find something eco-friendly that works for them and there life style!!
5,Only one mistake,"I read all nine reviews, & I totally agree that this was the most fascinating book I've ever read about the wonderful days of the ""big bands"". It seems interesting to learn that most of the successful big band leaders were not the easiest people to get along with. Perhaps being a strict disciplinarian with a short fuse just came with the territory. I read all nine reviews, & no one noticed the bit about Art Linkletter. On page 151, Levinson relates an incident involving Art, something that happened in 1942, saying that Art was a ""very active"" 93 year old at the time. When I saw & talked to Art at a dinner banquet in 1976, that would make him 127. I believe Art is still alive, though I'm not sure about this, & if so he's still lecturing about how to stay happy & fit as a senior citizen. Nonetheless, I loved this book. Jim O'Neil"
1,incorrectly listed,I may have gotten the wrong size. But I needed a UTH for my 20g long tank and the dimensions listed for this product are ideal - yet when I received the product - the dimension were 18inx7in instead of the listed 10inx9in.
3,Great Humor but Lacking in Extras,As for the actual Daily Show episodes they are sweet. The fact that this materials is now 8 years old and the jokes still hold up is a testament to the great writing. With all that being said this DVD set is barely worth the $5 I paid for it.The first 2 discs have only 4 episodes a piece on them. The extras include Comedy Central quickies and half baked commentaries. I have seen other reviews that love these quick 10 minute audio affairs. Having heard them all the humor is a lot different than that in the episodes. Non of the commentaries have anything to do with politics or the campaign.Buy this cheap or you might feel ripped off.
1,Fail,I originally bought this product as a gift at my local Big Lots and the DVDs were in poor shape. They had a weird cloudy and warbled appearance; only one DVD actually worked. So I thought I'd try to buy it again online. This set had the same issue. If you buy this... good luck.
1,Nearly burned down the house,"I don't know what happened, but it nearly sent the house up in flames. Pretty shocked to see what happened here. This was in my daughter's room. I can't think of anything worse than nearly setting my daughter's room ablaze. The pad was under the glass terrarium, with the added feet on the tank. It didn't seem to be putting any heat out so I looked under the tank and found the pad charred, burn marks on the dresser... the thing must have been an inch from lighting on fire.Horrible."
2,Not Sure,"This shipped in excellent condition from what I could tell, but after installing it I'm not even sure if it's working or not. I put this on the bottom of a 20 gal tank (the rubber feet they included to elevate your tank are great btw), and before lowering it back to position after 15 mins I put my hand on it and felt nothing, no heat. Maybe it just takes awhile to warm up, so I may update this review (and give a higher rating) if this turns out to be true. Otherwise, it was simple and easy to install!"
1,No Good,"The item shipped very fast. But when I plugged them in, they became very hot to the touch. Almost to the point of burning my skin. One shorted and melted the casing in 24 hours. The second did the same in a couple of days. I sent the third back along with the first two because I was afraid of shorting out and causing a fire. Do not buy."
4,Waste of money!,"The product is fine, it's my oldest Grandson who doesn't wear them unless I'm watching him at the skateboard park."
5,good fit - good price,"Good quality for the money. They fit well, and room to grow for my six yr old. He uses them with his electic mini bike. Might be a little much, but want him to appreciate being safe!"
4,"NOT FOR ADULTS, look great for kids","These pads look like they would be great for kids. They're well made and seem sturdy. I do not think they fit an adult, even ""petite"" adults."
5,Def a must,Definitely a must have with the ramps. I'm not so freaked out but I need to secure a helmet!!!!!! Thanks.Only with love from the adventurist's mother
3,Too big for my 6-year-ld,"A good product, but too big for my 6-year-old daughter who is about 46"" tall. Information for those who aren't sure about the fit. Some reviews wrote it fit their younger children so I purchased it hoping it would fit her. She can probably use them within 6-12 months."
4,"Quiet, effective small humidifier","This is a larger version of my older similar humidifier which gave out after about 12 years. It allows water to flow from the larger, 3 1/2 gallon tank by gravity when the level in the tray goes below the opening in the bottom of the tank. This opening has a spring/loaded valve in it so you can carry the tank from wherever you fill it to where the rest of the unit sits - in our case, in the great room. We only need to refill once per day.Because this has been a cold, dry winter here in North Carolina, the home atmosphere is very dry. This unit -rated for 1600 square feet - consistently maintains about 25% relative humidity on the low setting. The little humidity guage on the top shows both the target (45%) and the actual humidity in the room.I recommend it for those who are looking for an unobtrusive room humidifier at reasonable cost."
3,OK for a large room,"I had the earlier model of this humidifier a couple years ago until the fan just stopped working after 6 months. I had some hesitations when purchasing this newer model, but needed a cool humidifier because of my young son. This humidifier seems to run all the time, but it definately improves the moisture in the air. The only con that I have is the noise level. The fan could be quieter, but it is fine for conversation and tv watching. I would recommend this humidifier for a large room.Folow-up:The fan on the second one broke as well."
2,Noisy!,"This is the second one I have purchased and was happy for a short time, but the first one started making a rattling motor noise, then about a week after the second one started making the same noise. Other than that the units work great, however I was looking for quite units as well."
2,has a strange smell after one winter,"I bought it last winter and used it occasionally.I put it away about this spring and when I started using it again last week, it sent out this strange smell that we could not live with it. I have not checked what caused the smell but this disappointed me because we did dry it first before putting it away."
1,Noisy. Mine may be broken.,"It was a bit noisy at first and then after about 45 days it was so noisy we had to shut it off. It was past the Amazon return period so I emailed hunter--the manufacturer. They promised me a new one. Haven't seen it yet nor heard anything further. There are many positive reviews so it is possible that I got a lemon. We are now past the humidifier weather so I will not know if the new one does the job, assuming that I get it, until next winter."
2,Good Humidifier when it works,"This product lasts about 6-9 months fortunately there is a 3 year warranty on it. You just cut a portion of the cord and send the product label with serial number and model number to the Hunter Fan Company. I have sent back two units since purchasing this unit(34357) December 2010. They never send back the model type you originally purchased for example, I sent them the product label for this unit 34357 and they sent back a cheaper replacement model which costs about half of the price of the original model."
3,"Not bad, but not great","For some reason the art of building a great humidifier seems to not be possible. This product is okay, and I would buy again. Largest complaint is a ""clicking"" sound developed on low speed after about 3-4 weeks."
2,Disappointing,"The first unit I purchased had a malfunctioning humidistat and it was replaced immediately. The ""permawick"" is anything but permanent. It crumbled when I attempted to clean it and I ended up replacing just like a normal paper wick. I went to fire up my 2nd unit for the start of the 3rd season and the humidistat once again malfunctioned...reading ""Hi"" and shutting off after 10 seconds. I took the unit apart and disabled the humidistat. I'll run it manually until it dies. When it's working, it's a nice unit...I just unfortunately had too many problems."
3,Not a bad humidifier,"Mine was bought in Jan. 2003 and died today, Dec. 15, 2010, so I got almost 7 yrs service from it. Works best if you use distilled water and add a biostat to kill airborne bacteria so it doesn't ""grow"" in the water or in deposits inside the reservoir or tray. The humidistat didn't work all that well, so I left it all the way on, and monitored the room's humidity with a hygrometer and turned the unit on and off manually to maintain an acceptable RH level. I disassembled mine to see if it could be repaired, but the motor was burned out, so into the dumpster it went. Considering its construction, it's overpriced for what it is. Not sure if I'll buy another one of this model."
1,KEEP LOOKING,"""Whisper quiet?"" As compared to what, a jet engine? I bought this unit to use in about a 1200 s.f. space. Although it claims to be able to work for a larger space than that, it cannot even maintain a 35% humidity, even with the obnoxiously loud fan on high constantly. To make the room comfortable, I had to bring my other humidifier in from the bedroom, plus keep a large pot of water simmering on the stove. I will be taking this item back to the store on my next trip!!"
1,Hunter 34357 is a piece of junk.,"The first unit we bought refused to work the after the the first winter, so they shipped us a new one on the warranty and it quit working after three months. I'm not even going to bother to ship the second one back. This product should not be on the market."
4,I SEE THE LIGHT,"A new Hot Tuna album is always something to look forward too and this one does not disappoint in the least. It's the electric band taken from the last Furthur festival tour. Jormas voice just seems to keep getting more expressive as time goes by. Stand out tracks include Third Week in Chelsa,Watch The North Wind Rise and the 11 minute plus Funky #7. The only minor downside is that on the old Dead fave song Big Railroad Blues Michael Falzarano sings the lead vocals..I would have loved to hear Jorma sing this one otherwise a great cd and one all fans should add to their collections"
4,Drivin' Groove,"This album is great for driving around. The jams are sweet and the vocals/mixing are clear. Dead fans will like this,too."
5,My daughter looks forward to Junie B. nightly,"I decided that every night I would try to make an attempt to read to my daughter. I have 3 children, she is the middle and I wanted some her and I time! So, I give the 8 month old to the hubby, make the 7 year old wait in his room, and I read a chapter to my daughter. She begs for the next! She sometimes gasps at the spunk Junie B. has and the things she says! I bought this book because my daughter is in kindergarten and I thought it would help ease her into the 1st grade! I then went back to the store and bought the Stinky bus, and Big mouth! My son has started sneaking to the bedroom door to listen to the stories too! He enjoys her too, and well, then after I am done I tuck and kiss and move to his room to read Nate the Great!"
1,Kids Review,"Junie B. Jones goes to first grade at last! If you liked Junie B. Jones in Kindergarten, you'll love her in first grade. I know I did! I like Junie B. because she's a trouble maker. She always has an excuse for everything. She goes on little adventures which hardly work out well. If you like trouble, go to your local library and get Junie B. Jones Goes to First Grade at Last."
1,Junie's lost her spunk!,"I teach elementary school, and have been reading the Junie B. series to my classes the past several years. Books 1-17 have never failed to disappoint, and my students and I were eagerly anticipating Junie's new adventures in first grade.Sadly, we are very disappointed. This newest book had no laugh-out-loud parts like the other books do. Junie has matured too much! She isn't funny any more! Her journal entries are nothing like what a real first grader would write and she seems to have lost her spunk. I hope Barbara Park reads these reviews and brings us back the old Junie in the next book. We miss her."
3,addictive for the whole family,"I bought a couple Junie B. Jones books for my 7 year old. I thought that they would give her the desire to read herself. I started reading them to her and having her read the last few pages to me. Now the entire family and all my friends and students are addicted to them. On the 4th of July we handed one to my sister in law and she loved it so much she started reading it aloud. Everyone fell in love with the book. Among my guest that day was a retired English professor. He loved it too.These are books for families that love to laugh and discuss books. Junie B's grammar isn't always correct but that only serves to discuss what would be correct. Her behavior is often not correct. The incorrect bahavior is alway obvious and again gives occasion to discussing how something should be handled.I have 3 daughters 13,7, and 4 and often the whole family has to take a break from reading because we are laughing so hard that tears are coming to our eyes.We love these books!"
5,Junie B. to the rescue!,"My daughter loves the Junie B. books, and she read this one (several times) a few months ago. However, a few days ago, it turned out to be a very special book indeed, when we suddenly learned that she would also be getting glasses. We had gone to the eye-doctor thinking my son might need glasses, but it was my daughter that ended up with them. She was pretty upset (it was so unfair!), until we remembered Junie B! That helped her get over the shock enough to pick out frames and wear her glasses to school the next day. ALL the books in this series are delightful, but this has the special bonus of possibly providing some extra support ""insurance"" should the world go fuzzy for your little girl."
1,"This is a ""F"" word game!",I hate the PAs i9n this tgame. I also hate the Gigachips in this game. Its OK with the Megachips. Don't buy it!
3,Not everything is included,While this is fun to do not everything listed on the page is in the box. The smoking finger potion was not in the box and this was one of the main reasons i bought it. A lot of the potions are similar so you just keep doing the same thing over and over. Overall we still had fun.
2,Waste of money,There is no science/magic in this. Package contains large quantities of cheaper chemicals like baking soda and citric acid. You can do the most colorful experiment only once as the ingredient is enough for one round only.
1,Truly use this ONLY with adult supervision,We bought this and I didn't recognize one of the ingredients Polyacrylamide and I looked it up. It is a Neurotoxin that should only be used only with the strictest scientific protocols including rubber gloves and lab coat and adult supervision. It's scary to me that they would make a toy with this for 6 year olds.
4,Group 1850 - 'Agemo's Trip To Mother Earth' (Rotation),"Originally released in 1968, looks to be the Dutch psych band's first of three albums. To me, it sounded a lot like the first two Pink Floyd's lp's. Not that I'm complaining, mind you. 'Alemo's Trip' is a good find. It's noted as being one of the most accomplished psychedelic works from that era. Couple of the tunes here that impressed me the most were ""Little Fly"", ""You Did It Too Hard"", ""Refound"" and most of this CD reissue's nine bonus tracks I liked as well. Line-up: Peter Sjardin-flute&vocals, Dave Duba and Daniel VanBerger-guitars, Dolf Geldof-bass and Martin Duynhoven-drums. A should-have."
5,GOOD!,"They serve their purpose. I pump directly to my PES wide neck, and I am able to store them in the ref if I will feed them to my baby that day. I can also use this to pump/store when I am out at work."
5,Good,The do the job. Great thing to have for capping the bottles to store pumped breast milk or baby food when baby gets older.
2,They don't match with the bottles,"It's weird, but with some bottles they work and with others not. It's really a pity because the price is fair."
5,Sealing discs,What a great idea to be able to turn your bottle into a sealed container. I never used Avent bottles for feeding but I have an Avent breast pump and would store my milk in the bottles. These were great.
3,"Needed, but too many","I needed 2 of these for our bottles when going out and taking drinks with us, but unfortunately they only come in packages of 6.We now have 4 too many, that is too bad.Not very nice that the bottles do not come with these sealing discs already inside."
4,Top of the Top 18,"Interesting spelling and different grouping of names , but there is a lacking of meanings that can be found in other baby names books. Although there are lacings in this book there are good names and groupings."
2,Nothing Special.,This was not worth my money. Could have bought something like this at a much cheaper store. Poorly made nothing amazed me about this.
1,Don't pay extra for this brand,I bought the Monster cable because I had been told by salespeople in the past that Monster cable is a good brand. I found this product to be poorly manufactured. The connector plug broke away from the wire. Don't buy this product.
4,Excellent book for the starting out cichlid lover.,I recently recieved this book as a present and can not say enough about it. I found alot of the information in the book to be excellent and well informative. The book is perfect for anyone just starting out with a Malawi or Tanganyika Cichlid tank. If you are already knowledgable about the general care of the fish then this book is still for you. It goes into great depth on nutritional needs of the fish and breeding.
3,"No need to ""diagree""","No need to ""disagree"" - Dave Mason is thorouglhy enjoyable. Here as a solo artist and in his other endeavors (such as early Traffic).Nothing brilliant in here, but thoroughly enjoyable easy going rock."
2,Greenhouse?,"The pellets are excellent, just be careful not to let your seedlings get root-bound. I would recommend buying the pellets separately and investing in a decent propagation kit with a heating pad instead of this. It's not a mini greenhouse, just some flimsy plastic that wont support the weight of your seedlings. The plastic also creases easily and becomes too pliable when exposed to heat. Unfortunately heat is part of the process, so spring for the better kit with a heat pad."
4,"Pink Flamingos - great to annoy anyone with ""taste""","What can you say about Pink Flamingo's. These are great (they are cheap - but the price is right). These are great to annoy the relatives (they've got a lot of room to talk, they have a lawn gnome). Folks who wouldn't like these are the same folks who buy tiki torches and set the up perpendicular to the ground without any rakish tilt to them. I'm looking now for a St. Francis and a Lawn Jockey. I figure that'll set up my back yard for the summer. Buy'em and enjoy'em. Great gag gift for friends as well. I've given them to three of my friends and who love them (their wives hate them - so I rest my case)."
5,"If you missed this series, you missed the big one","SPG did this series right with some of the biggest new wave songs of the 80s in 12"" format. If you didn't get any volumes yet, do yourself a favor and pick up ""Classic Alternative: 12"" Extended Rare Mixes [BOX SET]"" and Classic Alternatives volume 4. BOX SET includes all 3 first volumes in the series, and volume 4 is a 3 disc set in itself!!! Selection here:1. the promise (6:25)2. love plus one (5:36)3. electric dreams (6:25)4. oh yeah (6:22)5. dancing in heaven (6:07)6. heartbeat (8:15)7. I ran (4:55)8. desire (6:15)9. sound of the crowd (6:25)10. eyes of a stranger (4:54)11. sinful (7:58)12. smalltown boy (9:05)"
4,PMA or PMS...I mean NMA,"postive mental attitude...I liked this book, when i was getting down on myself i found that reading this book lifted my spirits somewhat. I just didnt like the printing and size of the book. Other than that...the material was pretty good. buy it used..."
5,Powerful,"I never realized how negative my thought process was and how it directly (or indirectly) effected my business and personal life. ""Success Through PMA"" is an adventure into the mind. It makes us aware of why we think the way we do, and how we acquire our thought habits. One note though, this book is useless if you you just read it and put it away. You must read it and apply the techniques that the author suggests. Then read it again 6 months later, and you will feel the difference."
3,"Pretty good, but animation's weird","Okay, your probably thinking: This is just like Nuku Nuku TV? No way! Nuku Nuku, or Atsuko Natsume, is 19 years-old and is an All Purpose Cultural Cat Brain Androbot. Rynosuke meets Nuku Nuku again, in white hair and falls in love with her. Of course, guys out there would most likely be happy to have a beautiful girl like Nuku Nuku in his home, but she is also the savior of the town! With four awesome epidoses, clean opening and closing animation, and six anime previews from ADV films, Nuku Nuku packs a punch!"
5,Control other Characters!!,"This series of the game is so Darn good!You get to control other characters!For Example:In MMBNTC You control:Colonel,Knightman,Shadowman,Numberman,Toadman and Tomahawkman.In MMBNTP You control:Protoman,Gyroman,Magnetman,Meddy,Searchman and Napalmman.Enjoy Megaman BattleNetwork FANS!"
2,same old same old,"megaman battle network 5 team colonel is an ok game but the battle network series needs to go. i like megaman as much as the next person but its the same old stuff from the previous games, start off with battle tutorial, collect battle chips, do stuff, collect more battle chips, do more stuff, find out evil persons plans, collect more battle chips, do more stuff, defeat bad guy, end game. oh but wait ladies and gentlemen...the megaman people added liberation missions to make the game longer and more pointless!!!"
2,Very disappointing pictures and questionable information.,Great pictures on the front and back covers. Pictures on the inside are gray and lighter gray; printed on low quality paper. Actually suggests trying to suck or squeeze out the venom.
1,These guys get around,"Just click on the names of the writers listed above. It's mindboggling to see the other books they write. Frommers Germany 2004, Frommers Spain 2004, Frommers France 2004, Frommers Bermuda 2004, Frommers Bahamas 2004 ... and a lot more. I'd love to have their frequent flyer miles! I'd also buy a book by them about how to pack or how to get around the airports of the world. But there's no way I'd use one of these travel guides. I looked at this book but didn't buy it before making a two-week trip to Italy. When I got back, I looked at it again the next time I was in a bookstore. All I can say is, I didn't regret my choice. It's a big world out there. If you want to take a trip to Italy (or Spain or France or Bermuda), you can end up having a great time or a lousy time depending on what kind of information you have. These guys are stretched too thin. The Italy book, at least, is full of tourist traps and stereotypes."
3,okay I guess,I found it hard to believe (even though it is just a story) that Stevie would get along with Veronica plus the part about her dog was totally rash I mean talk about mood swing
4,Hot Stuff!,I really liked this movie. A lot of action and comedy thrown in for good measure. Selma and Penelope are great looking in this move. They are good actresses also. Adult comedy and action.
5,Awesome!,"This is truly a sleeper! I haven't enjoyed a movie this much for a very long time!These two ladies should do more movies together, what a raphor they seem to have!I give this 5 out of 5 stars!!!"
5,Achingly beautiful work,The editorial reviewers have done more justice to this beautiful book than I can. It is everything they say it is: a bittersweet delight to read.
5,"Great weeder, and hard to find!","Several years ago, I purchased a ""Scott's"" interchangeable tool set, with a long handle and several different attachments. The weeder/cultivator was the best I had ever used. This was at least 12 years ago, and I used that tool nearly every day in the garden. It had a 3-pronged claw on one side, and a flat blade for weeding on the other. This spring, it finally bit the dust, and I searched everywhere for a replacement. I took a chance that the ""Wolf-garten"" brand would fit my handle....and it does! So if anybody else has this problem, LOVES this tool, and needs to replace it....this is the only place on the planet to buy it."
4,Beautiful,"I first heard this song at a retreat, and then again working as a camp counselor at a field worship. I don't usually cry over a song, but this one is beautiful and powerful, a poignant reminder of what Christ suffered for us."
5,Beautiful song that only one can sing through with passion,"Beautiful song but I was wondering anyone can provide me details about the video or skit for this music. If best with mime, thank you. It is really important."
2,A Huge disappointment,"If you are buying this because you are a fan of the games, go away. It puts shame on the Final Fantasy name. Shame on you!!!! The dubbing is terrible, the animation is crude, and the characters are annoying."
5,"Phase 6 of ""Final Fantasy"", a nice collection of anime.",I had to purchase the next phase to keep my collection going. Artwork getting better.
4,More Riveting,"I found this DVD more riveting than those in the beginning of the series. I, for one, especially enjoyed the episode with Makenshi/Kumo's brother and their duel; however, I would have liked the background between them and the destruction of their homeworld explained a little more fully. I've felt from the beginning of this series that Makenshi/Kumo was not all he seemed and this episode especially works to make you realize that.I'm looking forward to Phase 6 and hope that it will begin to wrap this short-lived series up. As always, the cast is first rate -- especially J. Shannon Weaver; J. Hudson Brownlee and in Episode 18 -- David Stokely."
3,If you like FF...,"This is a decent series, but not awesome. It is only marginally related to the Final Fantasy world, and it tends to be very repetitive."
1,What you get is NOT what is in the picture/description,"I ordered two of these coins, and paid for overnight delivery. Notice that the coin advertised is a 2010 Curling coin.What I received are two 2007 Wheelchair Curling coins. Inexcusable."
5,Extremely shocking,"It's an amazing book, I read it and I truly believe that I'm impressed, maybe the ending it's not what I expected according to my particular point of view, but hey! everything might happen... all the pieces in the right place, the story, the sea, the characters... if you read it probably you wont feel that you want to read it again, but you're missing something really good if you dont check it out!"
4,Wonderful Choral album,The Mormon Tabernacle never disappoints. My only regret was that there wasn't more of it. Enjoy the joy in their voices.
3,Tradition,"I really liked hearing the old carols and , of course, the choir voices are wonderful. Nothing outstanding about this CD."
3,"Worthwhile just for ""Stand and Fight""","Sometimes you buy an album just for one song, and ""Stand and Fight"" makes James Taylor's DAD LOVES HIS WORK worth buying. Taylor upstaged no less than Bruce Springsteen with ""Stand and Fight"" when he performed it in the ""No Nukes"" concert film. The hard-driving protest tune loses no impact on DAD LOVES HIS WORK. The rest of the LP varies from routine to pleasant and includes the hit ""Her Town, Too."""
1,What Is A Marine,"The song ""What Is a Marine"" by Ernie Maresca can be found on the CD, ""Laurie Records Story Vol. 2."""
5,Just like the movie,"The book exactly follows the movie... so it's just what we were looking for! It does a great job of hitting every major plot point in pictures, which is great for my young daughter. There is a lot of writing that covers the story very well. My only TINY complaint is that I expected the pictures to be a bit more crisp, but the style of the art is a little more rustic looking. Although, every character looks exactly like the movie.Great choice if you have a Spirit lover who wants to watch the movie over and over :-)"
1,spirit book,"Not as good of condition as I had hoped. can't give it as a christmas present, need to find another."
1,This is NOT nylon rope!,"I should have read the reviews in addition to looking at the star rating before I ordered this. As an earlier reviewer already stated, the packaging says: ""Contains 1 or more of: nylon, polyester, polypropylene"".This means there's no telling what the rope is made of. It might not actually have any nylon in it at all!At any rate, one of the great things about amazon is the ease with which things like this can be sent back in case of issues like this. Which is exactly what I did."
5,Personal Value,"I had to buy this because my wife actually did some stunt work in it. It was the perfect surprise Christmas gift. As far as movies go, this one is BAD. Not ""Cutthroat Island"" or ""Ishtar"" or ""Glitter"" bad, but still pretty bad."
3,Where are you going?,From nightclubs to bars.. the music of Snow has changed .. the fans have changed.. The ol bluzy soft irregular meter songs were the best... Phoebee bring in the mike .. take down the vocal volume.. calm down the band.. sing more lavender not red.Old Fan Dan
4,a genuine pleasure to listen to,I saw this guy do a gig in the village in NY. I talked to him after the show and he said he put out a classical CD. I decided to give it a try and was really impressed. You always think of classical music in terms of the old masters but it's not often you find regular people producing contemporary classical music. I really enjoyed the cd and I often listen to it at work. I'm kind of suprised how often i find myself dialing it into my ipod. If you're in NY look for one of this guy's gigs. I don't know if he does the classical stuff on this cd live but talent is good no matter what flavor.
4,It's a knee wrap!,"Not a terrible lot to say about these - they are exactly what you'd expect. Well made, with a nice firm elastic. They have made a big difference to my squat - allowing me to go quite deep without compromising my knees. Would give them 5 stars, but it's tough to get terribly excited over a big elastic band!Would recommend these or something similar to anyone who has knee pain during or after squatting."
2,"Great Film, Poor Blu-Ray digital transfer","Great film, one of my favorites, but the Blu-Ray digital transfer is sadly very poor. The vintage footage looks vintage, but natural and pleasing. Unfortunately, the newer clips (interviews taken for the film, outside, in bright light), suffer from severe digital grain aliasing (likely scanned at too low resolution, it looks like this:[...]). I purchased Step Into Liquid Blu-Ray at the same time, and it is perfect."
2,.. OKAY - BUT SOME STUFF WASN'T TOLD,"okay laird (hamilton) is great, laird is good, laird is a all american rolemodel and laird is the pretty face in a american express commercial ....... bit big wave surfing isn't all about laird and his buddies. mister peralata - your film about the dog town skaters are nice and your ""documentary"" about the hawaiian surfers too ... but i do think that too much money from the industrie doesn't help to make a documentary good, instructive, exploratory, and most important neutral. you missed some important facts and important people - who influenced the sport probably more than laird ""i want to be on the cover of people magazine"" hamilton and his buddies and should you think that the tow-in crew isn't about real surfing ... i think i saw laird doing this at jaws :-)"
5,Awsome movie- and I dont Surf,"This is a documentary about the history of big wave surfing over the last 60 years. It is entertaining and educational and fills a void in a part of our history of a group that wasn't excepted until decades later. Surfing today is a recreation, but in Hawaii, in the 50's it was a lifestyle. The movie does a great job of showing how the sport has changed along with the waves. Before you see 'Chasing Mavricks', watch this. It has the true story. I dont surf, i don't watch surfing, but i love this movie."
4,"""Riding Giants"" DVD","This is an excellent surfing film, very well produced and edited. It includes some truly spectacular shots of big wave riding. Highly recommended."
2,Lots of shine but causes quick chipping,I love the colors you can get with china glaze and we use them at the salon all of the time and most of the time the colors come on pretty matte so this top coat adds the perfect amount of shine for that flawless finished look. but i feel like the top coat shrinks both itself and the polish and everything chips away super quickly. I will have chipped polish after only a few hours after i have painted my nails. its a shame because i love the shine but i honestly cant keep polish on my fingers for longer than two hours with out chips or peels which personally doesn't work for me. Especially when I'm in the salon and working a lot with my hands and clients see my chipped cracked and peeling paint job.
1,waste of money,"After a few days China Glaze Fast Forward Top coat shrinks the nail polish color. It creates a cracked looked within a day. Further, I bought the product 6 months ago and it is all dried out and evaporated. (I am positive that I closed the bottle tightly as I double-checked.)I would definitely not repurchase this product."
3,"Not Leonard's greatest, but much, much better than the movie","John Travolta just didn't capture the essence of Chili in the movie, but the book's not a bad read. It's just not a page-turner, either"
2,Boring without any true conclusions,"This was my first and likely last Elmore Leonard novel. I must have missed something but I didn't find it very suspenseful, there was no mystery, and by the end of the book there didn't appear to be any real conclusion. Chili Palmer was an alright character but come on. A collector working for a loan shark making it as a movie mogul with no experience! We should all be so lucky."
3,Not what I expected,I must have misread the features and the reviews 'cause I thought this unit also inflated tires.(Gotta read the small print better.)I was sorely disappointed when the box arrived and I discovered it would not be able to inflate my car tires. I did use it for a couple of my granddaughter's pool toys and it definitely inflated them quicker than the previous electric air pump I had that did tires. I would have sent it back but it's too much of a hassle so I'm going to Walmart and getting a tire inflator that works for my car battery.
5,Nylon-string guitar flights of fancy!!...,"This release is superb! If you are a fan of beautifully executed and masterful guitar playing from the heart, get your hands on this disc. Govi and Strunz & Farah are my two favorite 'nouveau flamenco' artists by far. They exhude passion and warmth to their playing that not many others can achieve."
1,A Horrible Movie-The Dancer Upstairs,"This movie is definitaly NOT worth watching. It is very boring and it takes forever for the movie to end. Besides, the dancer lives downstairs, not upstairs. Then when the girl is reading the index cards, you could see the spanish words on them...unperfessional. It would have been better if this movie was in Spanish and it never was showed to the US. The movie also takes place in South American, with all Spanish Actors, they should just speak spanish! Another thing I didn't like was Ramiro Jimenez, he should not be in acting...he was horrible in this movie!"
1,The worst actor-Ramiro Jimenez,I was highly unimpressed by Ramiro Jimenez. Go back to teaching...your no star! You stink like rotten bananas!!
2,VOO-DOO OR REVOLUTION??,"I should have known this movie was in trouble when the credits said 'somewhere in Latin America.' That ambiguous statement is usually reserved for TV cereal productions.The movie runs 133 and if you were to just catch the last five minutes of this flick it would be enough. The story meanders , the dialog is trite and the only reason I stayed until the end, was, I couldn't believe Javier Bardem would be wasted on on a movie which could not make up its' mind; if the Latin American country where this took place was having the makings of a Revolution or a psychotic voo doo happening.John M. has always been spooky to me , he likes those dark and ""Ha, Ha, bet you cannot figure me out"" characters in most of his movies. But, if this is his Directorial debut, he has not much to offer his fans.Javier Bardem and his side kick Juan Diego Botto are the only light in a otherwise very dark movie.I give this flick a 21/2 out of 5 mainly for those two actors.ciao ..."
1,An abstract terrorist,"This movie is all about the search for an invisible 'terrorist'.This terrorist is not only invisible, but nobody explains in the movie for what he stands.He threatens what? The police in general, the political system, the (elected or totalitarian) government? Or is he acting out of a personal revenge? Or is it simply a drugs dealer? Nobody knows.So, all the action in this movie centres on an abstract character, a ghost. The search in itself is then the main theme of the movie. Not very interesting, if you ask me.At the Rotterdam Film Festival I saw two magisterial movies about terrorists: 'Rachida' by Yamina Bachir and 'L'autre monde' by Merzak Allouache. A comparison is a judgement."
3,Mostly for completists,"This is a rare recording of Dr.King speaking in Shreveport,Louisiana in 1958. Aside from historical purposes,it's not that great. Basically, he speaks on the use of ""Negro"" history to inspire people to fight for their rights. But the history he uses as an examle is actually biblical history as opposed to Black history. Overall, not bad, but I've heard better King speeches. Incidentally, contrary to the advertising, there are at least two earlier King speeches that I know of that are available to the public. The 1955 Bus Boycott speech is on the ""A Call To Conscience"" CD and a 1954 sermon ""Rediscovering Lost Values""(before his fame in the Bus boycott) is on cassette."
2,Not A Bad Recipe Reference,"If you're looking to get your feet wet in homebrewing, this book is most likely NOT for you; it's little more than a collection of recipes, basic charts, and really, really basic information that you can get from your local homebrewing club, and trust me -- you have a local homebrewing club.If you're looking for a compilation of various recipes, some atrocious, some gems, this'll hit the spot. Not recommended."
2,at least it didn't cost much,Don't buy this book for its introduction to the brewing process or its description of the world of beer ingredients. However it is a nice collection of recipes... but you could get those for free in lots of other places.
2,Failure to connect,"Most of the time it does not connect. I have tried with new batteries on 3 computers (vista 32 bit, xp pro, and xp pro 64 bit) and the problem is the same.When it does connect it is a reasonable controller. Other reviewers recommend giving it its own powered hub, I might try that in the future."
2,"Good Product, But did not work for what I had intended","I bought this controller solely to play the PC version of Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 and it was incompatible, unfortunately. The controller is exactly like a regular xbox controller and no complaints on the construction."
1,disappointed...,"OK.. so I'm not an expert at windows... I bought this product ""Microsoft XBox 360 Wireless Controller for Windows"" not to use it for games .. but simply as a windows mouse replacement for a child to be able to use windows from across a room using a large monitor... ( a wireless mouse is quite difficult to use without a surface to rest it on ) the name of the product indicates that it would be possible to do that... but it doesn't seem to work at all."
4,Great...if u can get it to work.,I pluged it in installed it and restarted and it works fine but if its plugged in my usb headset doesnt work at all.i had to buy a usb hub.but other than that its great.
4,This ROCKS,This controller rocks once you get it setup. The biggest problem is lack of documentation but once it's done it work very well and is very responsive. Just note that the control comes with the Wi-Fi adaptor so don't by one separately.
5,Great price for a nice variety of colors,I bought this set of string to keep in my kitchen drawer. I'm always looking for string for some project or another and this set gave me a nice variety of colors for a good price.
4,Authentic soul and passionate disco,"This falls short of being a Best Of by the mighty soul voice Patti Labelle. It nevertheless contains some of her greatest disco and soul hits like the dance classic Music Is My Way Of Life, torch masterpieces like I Don't Go Shopping and Come What May, and the majestic uptempo Lady Marmalade with its raucous French chorus which was considered rather risque way back in the seventies. Her gritty soul is immaculately expressed in tuneful dance numbers like Joy To Have Your Love and passionate ballads like You Are My Friend. Although incomplete, having been first released many years ago, this is an enjoyable album of R&B; classics. I also recommendGonna Take a Miraclewith Laura Nyro andNightbirdsby the group Labelle."
2,Missing a lot of hits!,"This CD is actually a 1981 album collection issued by Epic after her 1st 4 solo albums 1977 - 1980. That's why there are only 8 songs , as it was originally a vinyl and cassette release. Hence, it's missing a lot of Patti's career songs, hits and highlights that made history [ ON MY OWN, NEW ATTITUDE, OVER THE RAINBOW, IF ONLY YOU KNEW, LOVE NEED AND WANT YOU, SOMEBODY LOVES YOU BABY and on and on ]. It does contain the #1 hit by the group Labelle LADY MARMALADE, Patti's first solo hit JOY TO HAVE YOUR LOVE, and her anthem YOU ARE MY FRIEND. But LITTLE GIRLS is hardly an essential song. This is just a sample of Patti's late 70's work. A real best of would be the CD : PATTI LABELLE'S GREATEST HITS to get or the Half Labelle/Half Patti Solo collection: LADY MARMALADE: THE BEST OF PATTI AND LABELLE."
3,cute but a bit over priced....,"I got this maraco for my 8 month little girl and was happy that we got a pink one. When I ordered this item I apparently did mot see the measurements, it was much smaller then I expected. Great for little hands but the price was a bit to much for a single tiny maraco."
5,"Great product, just as described!!","Great product, just as described!! Our little girl just loves these at 9 months old and can pack it around easily."
1,Failed every time,I have previously used the mice cubes and had very good luck with them but I still had one very wily fellow left so I ordered this trap. Every single time this trap has tipped before he could even get in the door. Perhaps he's a husky fellow. I didn't see the mice device at the time I ordered or would have ordered that instead. A friend just told me about it and I just placed my order. It has great reviews and I only wish I'd known about it sooner.
3,Probably would have worked if I had a dumb mouse.,"Didn't work for me, but then I think I had a really smart rat after all and not a mouse. However I like how this were super easy to set up and didn't make me scared that I'd loose a finger."
1,CAUTION: Product description says you'll get 6 and only 1 arrived,"Probably figured it was too good to be true but the description reads as follows:Product DescriptionTip-Trap Live Capture Mouse Trap. This price is for 6 traps Made of polypropylene, resistant to stains and odors."
1,Don't buy this garbage.,"This mouse trap is complete garbage. I challenge anyone to catch a single mouse in this. The mice were actually skipping this thing, and going for the traps that killed them instead lol. The ONLY way I can see this thing working, ever, is in some kind of old, unused building scenario. Where there is little/no food for the mice, and there are a ton of mice in the building. Then you might catch a really stupid mouse in this. They just don't like it. They just won't go into it. I tried this thing for about 5 months, replacing the bait when necessary. Never caught a single mouse."
5,BESSSSSSSSST PRODUCT - HUMANE,"Who ever is reading this, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE buy this product and release mice safely.Do Not EVER EVER EVER use a glue trap, it is totally inhumane. I was unable to save alittle critter yesterday felt so so bad, my apartment people placed those glue traps.I saw a mouse with its nose stuck to glue, I cried after I was unable to save it.If you ever come across such scenario, do not pour too much cooking oil. Please pouronly few drops and try to rescue the mouse. But This product, is absolutely amazing,This product is Humane, worked for me in 3-4 Hours time. I used Hershey's chocolate as bait.The feeling when I left the little critter in the woods is great, he was so happy and wentoutside jumping jumping ... Please SAY NO TO GLUE TRAPS"
4,Good information for every soaring pilot,"Piggott is of course the world's best-known gliding instructor and this text adds to his reputation. The only problem with the book is the chapter on power pilots converting to soaring - it is simply out of place, and one has the distinct impression that it has been added as ""filler"" (it's interesting to note that Piggott includes a similarly out-of-place chapter on glider pilots converting to powered flight in one of his other books, Understanding Gliding)."
2,wrong size maybe,I bought these to mitigate the wind noise while riding my motorcycle. I don't know if they're the wrong size or if they're not suited for the purpose but they don't do the job. The wind noise is still much too loud. The Howard Leight Max1 earplugs do a much better job.
3,Minimalism Through and Through,"Don't let those people who gave this album five stars fool you. This is no five star album! This is truly a minimal album (deserving of only minimal stars): First the minimal price: at $10 you think you're getting a bargain, but wait: Second, there is the minimal length: it's only 39 minutes long. Third: the minimal liner notes: you won't find much at all. A little background on these pieces might have helped. But what you get is only a listing of the ensemble's members, plus the time and place of recording. Fourth: in order to really ""enjoy"" (or shall I say ""endure"", since that is more minimal) this album, you must turn the volume down, and distract yourself with something else. Try looking out the window or surfing the Internet or reading. Otherwise it will be extremely tedious and boring. In summary, I would recommend you try another Glass album, not this one. I strongly recommend the soundtrack to Kundun."
1,Empty and pointless,"After you get over the initial energizing effect of the racing instruments, you realize how this is nothing but arpeggios repeated endlessly with some minor variations and shifts. In other words, each piece here is really only about 6 seconds of composed music stretched out for a very long time. This minimalist approach seems like a racket to me . Everyone praises Glass for being prolific but who couldn't be when he really hasn't written much music; he has only written an hour or so of music and stretched it out for an entire career by repeating small bits of it for hours. I cannot believe that this stuff will last. It is tiresome now and will be forgotten in a few years once the Glass marketing machine wears out."
1,Junk music at its most ridiculous.,"I heard this CD in cassette form a few years back when someone loaned it to me. I was supposed to find it very modern and cutting-edge. My review at the time consisted of the observation that anyone with a sequencer and two minutes' worth of musical training could have done as well or better.It is unexplainable that a zero-talent like Glass would be allowed in a recording studio or on a concert stage. There are talented composers out there, and Glass is not among them.Shame on Sony for putting out such garbage!"
5,Don't Stop at Season 1. We Want Them All!!!!,"Oh man we begged and begged and begged, and its finally coming. Season 1 in its entireity. Yep watching shows like Family Guy, Sanford and Son, Sex and The City, and even *Gulp* Mad about you pass us up and we will finally get chapter one of Bundyville!!!Listen Columbia there is a huuuuuuuge fan base of us out there and we need every season, (Even the crappy last one). Why, because this is the greatest show of all time and mostly the reruns are on when I'm working. My first Married With Children was purchased with the Bundyful Christmas on VHS, and I will buy every piece of media I can get, especially for DVD!!!Did I forget to say ""Don't stop with just season one!!!"" Columbia please get season two out before Christmas..."
1,Picture quality: horrible and intrusive!!!,"Why oh why did they have to do this so badly? Married With Children deserved better, much better. The picture quality is horrible - full of compression artifacts, riddled with grain and blur. A disgrace, really, when you consider how much of a HUGE hit this show was, and the massive loyal fan base. I bought this DVD, even after hearing about the bad image quality, and still hoped that it would be average looking. It turned out worse than I expected. It's so distracting. Just tonight I was trying to watch that episode where Al and Peggy are trying to get to Johnny Be Good's before it closes forever. But the terrible visual quality kept distracting me. Instead of me being involved in the story and laughing, every so often my brain would hiccup at the terrible grain and blur. Come on, this is outrageous. I also just received Season Two (I had to, I'm a die hard Bundy fan!), and that's done in the same cheap way. Dark and blurry and grainy.[...]"
4,"MWC!! Finally, All The Episodes Will Be Mine!!!","Do you remember the first scene of the first show? Rambo Bud sneaks down the stairs, puts the blade to Kelly's neck and says, ""Die, Commie bimbo!!"" It was love at first sight. You knew something special was happening. They rarely disappointed (if you can look past the ""Seven"" season and lack of a true finale). Like a truly great long-running show, they had just about anyone who was anyone as a guest. But MWC's guest list was sexy and notorious. The Sam Kinison Christmas shows were arguably the best holiday shows ever - the perfect counterpoint to ""A Charlie Brown Christmas"". And Jessica Hahn as ""The Shoe Groupie"" was truly inspired casting. And unlike even the great ""Seinfeld"", the cast has had success post-MWC. The rumor is that Ed will guest on ""8 Simple Rules"". And how cool was it to see David on one of the last X-Files! I can't wait!!"
5,best bookstore in the universe,"I snatched up this book when it came up during a search for another book. It is the best bookstore anywhere. I know because I worked there in the mid eighties while a grad student at the Univ of Utah. And I know first hand how Betsy Burton's passion for books drove the store.It was a delightful trip down memory lane as I reminisced about the great people who worked there sharing their love of books as well as the wonderful readings by visiting authors sharing their words. It will always stand as one of the best times of my life.Thanks to Betsy for reminding me of that time, and for the best bookstore in the universe."
1,"""every breath, sign, groan and vocalization""",There's only one thing to say about my previous reviews: never mind.
5,Inspiration from deep within,"My Dad bought me this recording when I took up playing the piano a couple of years ago. As a nine year old, I loved Beethoven's music so much that I got the sheet music of the Pathetique, and am learning to play the first movement, even though my hands can't quite reach a full octive easily. As Dad says: ""what has Beethoven got that can grab the soul of today's youth, even with all the distractions of the 21 century?"" Listen and find out!"
5,simply genius!,"At first I was a little sceptacle about buying Faiths christmas cd.But once I heard it I thought it was absolutly pure genius.I love her rendition of ""This Christmas"",which happens to be my favorite christmas song.My ultimate favorite songs on the cd are ""Happy Holiday"",""Mistletoe and Holly"",""Christmas Wish"",and ""O Come All Ye Faithful"",and by the way she tears this song up.Faiths voice sounds great on each and every song.You should definitly buy this,its a must have for this holiday season."
4,Merry Goodness,"I like, got it when it first came out. Not perfect, but it is good and worth buying if you like Faith which I do. Her voice is so pure I just enjoy hearing her sing, plus she's very beautiful to me which doesn't hurt - hahaa. Don't understand why people complain, they have samples to listen to first. Why buy something you can sample first then complain, that's not smart. Hope she releases another R&B CD soon, it's been about four years - way overdue. (10/2009)"
4,Affordable,"Iguana outgrew cave quickly, but it was durable & made good decor. Heat rock still works fine tho...his favorite place to be"
4,Not copycats of bratz,"""THE MY SCENE DOLLS are copecaters!! Well, when the BRATZ came out in the summer of 2001 thay kicked BARBIES but, MATTEL had to think of a better doll. so, thay made the MY SCENE dolls.Thay only Thoght thay would sale better than the BRATZ.Now pepole (like me) are complating that thay copecated the one and only BRATZ dolls.THIS TOY SINKS!!!! THIS TOY RINKS!!! AND THIS TOY SUCKS !!!! BYE !!!""Ummmm.... NOT! They all come from one Large company that owns little companies that make different toys. So all the money goes to one place! And they also make flavas and polly pocket, Diva starz and everything! So they can't copy each other! They come from the same place! DUH!(Oh and they are bringing back the ""non smiling"" dolls for July 31st 2004, they are called ""masquerade madness"")"
2,Not a COOL toy!,"THE MY SCENE DOLLS are copecaters!! Well, when the BRATZ came out in the summer of 2001 thay kicked BARBIES but, MATTEL had to think of a better doll. so, thay made the MY SCENE dolls.Thay only Thoght thay would sale better than the BRATZ.Now pepole (like me) are complating that thay copecated the one and only BRATZ dolls.THIS TOY SINKS!!!! THIS TOY RINKS!!! AND THIS TOY SUCKS !!!! BYE !!!"
5,My 4th copy!!!!,I was so thrilled with this CD that I have purchased and given away 3 copies!! The songs are fantastic and recorded in an order that keeps the listener enthralled!!!! It is my all-time favorite!!!!!
5,I Felt Like I Was There,"This is a wonderful album for anyone enjoys the pomp and circumstance that surrounds the British royalty. It's the next best thing to being there for the Queen's Official Birthday Parade. It takes you musically from start to finish.A favorite cut is ""To Your Guard"" which is the march that returns the Queen to Buckingham Palace at the head of the Foot Guards. It begins with the uniquely British 5-beat drum roll and carries on with a rollicking, brassy beat. You can sense the Guards' pride (and as any past participant in formal parades can attest, their RELIEF on leaving the parade ground at long last) as they march away up the Mall."
1,Simply awful,"I love Sarah V., the depth and range of her voice are truly amazing. I adore Gershwin, esp his lyrics. This production is terrible. Sarah talks, doesn't sing, does a lot of do-be-do-be-wah stuff, ignores the melodies, races through exquisite lyrics, making them unrecognizable and the orchestra is ignoring them both (Sarah and Gershwin). I can only imagine that the applause, (its a live performance) is coming from people who know nothing about either. Save your money if you like these artists."
3,Cold and Slimy then Pleasant,"They are initially kind of a mood killer. Nobody likes cold and slimy.But, my husband says they feel better than latex and I think they feel more natural.Definitely still feels like there is something there though."
3,Reiki: Space of the Repeating music that gets anoying,"The original cords of the music are wonderfully relaxing and melodic. They are soothing and contemplative, but the whole track keeps repeating the same melodies and cords over and over and over again throughout the length of the cd. In my opinion, it would have been nice to have some different melodies and cords mixed in to the originals, which I thought there was when I sampled the cd online. The cd does have some ""magical"" qualities in the music that can take you to another place thought, if you can put up with the same melodies over and over again.If you don't like the same music repeated over and over again for an hour, I would recommend NOT buying this cd."
5,Fantastic,I am a Reiki Practitioner and this CD is absolutely fantastic and has become one of my favourite treatment CDs
2,do not buy this,there is a cheaper version of this exact same recording which also includes the brahmes double concerto with leonard rose. it is from the essetnial classics collection and would save you 2 dollars.
1,DON'T BOTHER,Don't even bother with this book. So much of the information is WRONG that I'm amazed the editors even let this book get through!
4,Excellent for those with 1-3 years experience,"I bought this book 4 weeks ago and I have steadily worked through all the exercises. I have 3 years experience with SunOS. I found that I could easily answer most of the questions which makes me confident that I'll pass the first exam next week. I'd like more practice exams to be included in a future edition - there are only 400 questions on the CD-ROM. Also, I might be blind, but I couldn't see any Microsoft jokes in this book lanman94..."
1,Don't waste your money!,"A Slapdash.It seems like Author doesn't care about reader at all.Non-systematic, not full, fragmentary.Questions in a book MUCH simpler then in real exam.Questions on CD are the same as in a book. ""Exam"" on disk contains no explanations, no commentaries, even no references to book pages (just ""Refer to the book for additional explainations"", ""No hint available"", etc.).The only ""Appendix A"" (80 pages out of 570) contains absolutely useless for exam prep staff: executables names, rights mask, file sizes and cheksums.I wish author would redeem my copy of his book."
2,pretty good set,"Sharissa kinda reminds me of Lil Mo a bit.might be better suited as a Hook chick.but there are some cool Jams here including ""In Love with a thug"" with R.Kelly which is Hot Grits&Gravy Soulful.that song alone is worth the Price.R.kelly Sings this Song Like Smoke coming off a BAR B Que Pit.this is FIRE!!!! Sharissa got a nice range,but I can't see Her making it as a Album Artist. the Album aside from ""In Love with a Thug"",&I Got Love is slightly better than Average."
2,For one song ...,I honestly brought this album for one reason alone ... to finally own the extended version of Meant for this Moment. It was a song I heard as a kid on 99.1fm in the early 90's and now as an adult I searched and searched for it. Finally after two years of searching ... it will be mine :)
2,Would make a nice pamphlet,"I was very disappointed with the book. There are some nice ideas but it is padded with a ton of fluff. The ideas would make a very nice pamphlet, but they are not enough to fill out a book. As it is, the book is very short - about 150 under-sized pages - and overpriced for what you get."
4,"Isaac is Great, but","Isaac Stern is one of my all time favorite violin virtuosos, but Fritz Kreisler owns the Beethoven Violin Concerto. Despitethe quality of the 1936 recording, the performance is still the most dynamic ever. If you want a more modern recording with less background noise I would recommend Nathan Milstein's or Zino Francescatti's (with Kreisler's cadenzas played stunningly). The eccentric Bronislaw Hubermann made a very good recording in 1935, but you'd have a hard time finding it."
1,bits and pieces about yhe grateful dead,"Buyer beware this is one of those talking heads dvds,I thought it was some early Dead performance video boy was I wrong!Bits & Pieces"
4,Really excellent album,"There are so many beautiful and very emotional tracks on this album that would make excellent singles: Burn, Wise, New Beginnings, Tune In and Learn to Fly, not to mention The Way She Loved Me and The Way That I Feel. He has chosen beautiful tunes to include in his album.And his voice has tiny touches of Richard Marx and Bryan Adams and Australia's own giant, John Farnham, but is quite different from all of those and distinctive in his own right.I really recommend That's What I'm Talking About. This album is very addictive and once you start listening you just don't want to play anything else."
4,"Sure, I'll give it 4...","Futureperfect is a mixed bag of really cool and not-so-really cool ebm/future-pop tunes. But the really cool tunes make it hard not to buy, and out-number the not so cool. Generally, there are either slow ambient tracks, or dancy fast-paced tracks...there is one or two in-between. Most tracks have a trancy melodic synth lead that hooks you in. I think if the vocalist could learn a few more notes in the musical scale, vnv just might be one of my favorite bands...but unfortunately, he only knows about 3 or 4. This is fairly good tho, I fence-walk on recommending this to any synth/ebm critic."
2,It's over.,"Before I violently bash this album, I will say that there are some slight similarities with Futureperfect to earlier music. A few tracks did manage to hold the intensity in the rhythm and harsh drumloops VNV once had when they did Praise The Fallen and parts of Empires. But saying that much is extreamly generous. The positive points of this album are scarce. My main beef with this album is what happened Ronan's vocals. I could have sworn I was listening to a rivet Rod Stewart. And some songs, particularly track 5, sound like a missing song from the Lost Boys soundtrack. I really don't like to say bad things about a band with as much potential as VNV, but I could have gotten a better sound urinating on a vinyl chair.For existing VNV fans don't even bother buying it used. For people new to VNV don't waste your money, this album will just give them a bad name. Get your moneys worth with Praise The Fallen and hear what this band really sounds like."
5,A great television score!,"First off, this is a television soundtrack, not a movie soundtrack-- many of the ""instruments"" are synthesized. Okay, that aside, this is a great album! It's been a long time since I've heard so many different character themes on a tv soundtrack. From the Heroic ""Dylan Hunt"", to the brooding ""Rev Bem and Magog"" music, to the outright ominious ""Neitzscheans"" themes, this album is a winner. It's nice that the producers also included Alex Lifeson's ""March of the High Guard"" theme from season 1, which is regrettably no longer used on the show. The music on this album takes you on a emotional roller coaster-- from mysterious, to brooding, to heroic and back again. High recommended for fans of both scores and the television series alike!"
1,"Pretty for 1 day, big dissappointment","I purchased a large set and ordered every completer piece. Loved the shape of the mugs. The mugs in the microwave get too hot to handle. The dish gets so hot in the microwave, it will BURN your fingers. The plates all scratch the finish off and chip terribly. I have no children at home and they get light usage. The dinner plates barely fit in the cupboard, and only a few at a time in the dishwasher. I would need an extra deep dishwasher to fit them in. They are very heavy and thick. Don't stack more than 6 high of the plates. Canisters suction seal does not work and the lids pop off. In the embossed part of the dish, the finish light and will wear through leaving exposed white dish. Don't waste your money like I did. I had this set for 2 months and am replacing the entire set with a different brand. They chip very easy. Marcia"
2,poor quality,The pattern was attractive but the rims of all the plates in the set of six contained imperfections. There were numerous brown discolorations on the rims of every plate.
5,* BE SHARP ABOUT YOUR SCISSORS' CHOICES *,"This review is a 'paean' of praise for GINGHER's Lion's Tail embroidery scissors, the 3 1/2"" model. with leather sheath & gold-plated handles. Which came first, the reputation /OR/ an avalanche of letters from women thrilled to own a perfect tool? All Gingher shears & scissors have an impeccable reputation and for this reason, the Gingher name ""stands on its own.""Of all the small models made by Gingher, this is the one I find most useful. Incidentally, when you present them as bridal gifts, they demonstrate your own good taste! Among artists and hobbyists they are prized for paper cutting of intricate designs. Reviewer mcHAIKU suggests you go to your quilting friends if you actually need more convincing."
5,"A must-read book, and fitting tribute.","This is quite simply an outstanding book. In the race to land humans on the Moon, a number of astronauts and cosmonauts died, and many were quickly forgotten. They have been missing from the pages of the history books - until now. This book brings their personalities to life in warm detail, drawing on unprecedented cooperation from the families, it seems. For the first time, I have come to know the stories of men who, if not for unfortunate accidents, would have been some of the most famous names in American history. You get to know them as people, their good and bad sides, their failings but mostly their incredible professionalism and dedication. One of the decade's most important space books, and a must-have for anyone interested in the subject."
4,Probably the greatest amalgamation of musicians ever!,"As Jann Wenner said about this concert, this is the Wall Of Sound, and there is no better way to present the Wall Of Sound in a live setting than with the music of George Harrison. What else can I say about this that hasn't been said already. My only qualm with the album is that the cut up shortened version of ""Wah-Wah"" that completely neglects to include the amazing Jim Horn sax solo that is included in the movie."
1,disappointed,"I know that a lot of you will not agree, but I find it very disappointing. A lot of things are not explained well enough. Very often you find yourself re-reading the sentence wondering how the hell did they get to this conclusion. Anyway - just a personal opinion: I don't find it good enough for a beginner and definitely not deep enough for advanced anesthesiologists."
4,Great show,This show is hysterically funny. The DVD is convenient for everyone who can't always catch the reruns on American television.
5,Blows American humor totally away,"Having lived in the states since I was three, yet being of nearly 100% British heritage, I love sitting down and watching a good Britcom on Saturdays. This typically meant AYBS, Keeping Up Appearances, Waiting for God, My Hero, As Time Goes By, and so on. But, when my wife and I watched the first episode of Coupling, we both laughed our [bottoms]off! This is by far the funniest comedy I've seen in years, and this is coming from a big fan of Black Adder and Jeeves and Wooster. Every episode had us laughing in our seats, much more so than ANY American comedies, or even other Britcoms, for that matter. Coupling is simply the best written comedy I've ever seen; the humor is adult, certainly, but being 29, I find that I can easily relate with the characters. Favorite episode? ""Inferno""; just watch it and you'll see why..... Don't believe me? Watch a few episodes of Coupling and you'll see what I mean!"
5,Absolutely hilarious show!!,This is a great show and is a must for anyone who appreciates great British Comedy... or is looking for a sexier alternative to Friends (which seems boring and unfunny in comparison!). This show is simply amazing and gets better each time you watch it.
5,Much better than Friends,"I used to be an avid viewer of Friends, but eventually, I grew to find some of the characters really annoying. The Ross-Rachael thing got old and both have become kinda annoying and whiny.Compared to that, Coupling is a relief. It's unashamed to cut to the chase -- sex, and while wacky and sometimes confusing, manages to touch upon issues that we've all faced, but other shows have been afraid to joke about. Must be an English thing.Anyway, catch this original BBC series -- I'm afraid that the US remake will come up well short..."
1,Not what we wanted,"The photo for this product is very different from the actual product. Zoe arrived in a ballerina outfit which is not removeable. I contacted seller who said they would send me a POSTAGE PAID RETURN LABEL. I never recieved the label and while I have contacted the seller a second time, I recieved no return message.Very Unhappy."
2,Purchase of stainless steel sink tray implement holder,"I purchased two of this item. Stainless steel is of poor quality and rusts very quickly when exposed to residue from wet soapy implements such as sponges, dish scrubbers, etc. It can be cleaned with a brillo pad and scouring powder but is a pain and rust returns quickly in a short time of use. I would not recommend this item because it becomes very unsightly quickly. Additionally, its dimensions do not lend themselves to an unobtrusive mounting on many sinks."
3,Tenacious D,I decent movie with many F bombs. It was interesting and very funny to see what started out as a fun project and a joke became serious and stressful.
4,Awesome classic!,"They may go out of fasion, but they never go out of style! A great product and a great look."
4,Perfect fit for my Hansgrohe Soap Dispenser,I took a leap and tried this soap dispenser bottle to replace my broken Hansgrohe bottle. They have a tendency to break or crack around the threads. Just wish the shipping was cheaper for one.
4,As advertised. Good value for the money.,Product works as described. Easy to use. The only negative is the length of time it takes to roll up the twine. However this is explained upfront and is no surprise. I would recommend this to a friend.
3,"In general good, so I gave it a 3 (fair enough)","I think the song is good, same with the lyrics. But, to me, there is one small problem. In the song, Jessica tends to 'scream.' No, I'm not sayin this song is bad, that is why I gave it a 3/5. If you don't mind her voice when she reaches the high notes, then you should definately buy this CD, because it is a great song."
5,"Absolutley Wounderfull, dont you think?","I have Read a lot of your reviews and most of them are ""dissing"" Miraih Carey. Miraih Carey is very beautiful, as she has allways been. I do not feel she needs to do anything to make herself even more beutiful as she seems to think. As a long time fan of hers I am very disturbed but I feel she has nothing to do with Jessica Simpson. Jessica Simpson is Beautiful, Nice and has a amazing voice. She also seems to have no fear of anything, can be herself and still have all of That popularity. I think she deserves alot of credit and she is ABSOLUTLEY WOUNDERFUL."
2,"Well made, but too wide.","I purchased this calendar to help organize my family's activities. Although it is well made, it is very wide and requires a lot of space. I tried to hang it on a number of walls in my house as well as behind doors, but it is slightly to wide to fit behind my doors - the edges stick out and scrape the doors. If I trim it, the laminated cover will likely start peeling. While I like that it shows 3 months at a time, but have yet to use it because I haven't found the right place to put it."
5,this book worked for my family,"I chose this book because it wasn't overly technical, gave several choices on how to approach training your child (what works best for your family, schedule, and style), and had many testimonials to underscore Faull's points. My son was potty trained within three weeks, both. Not a single accident after a year.I heartily recommend this book for new parents--Faull has a nice approach that isn't condescending and you'll feel confident in doing her simple instructions for training your little one. If it doesn't work for your child, she gives advice about that too (no one has failed!) This one is worth it."
2,Parenting at its worst,"This book was just OK in that it gave few suggestions of tricks to help you along in the process of potty training. Instead, it was flooded with stories of parents who had horrible parenting practices, (such as scolding, shaming, and spanking their children into submitting to potty training.) One story even depicted a family that physically tied their child to the toilet!!! Granted, these examples were given to show what NOT to do, but I personally would never think of treating my child like that, anyway. Although it did emphasize the importance of social rewards, (""good job""), it could have left out the detailed section showing me how some parents give toys or lolipops when their child poops in the toilet! I was searching for a potty training book that had more concrete information, and one that assumed that I was already treating my child with utmost love and respect. Anyone have any suggestions???"
1,Pap.,"There's a new law of supply and demand, the author breathlessly informs his readers, and then bombards them with such gems as ""satisfy your customer!, ""analyze the factors affecting your business!"" and, one imagines, ""buy low and sell high!""There's nothing at all of substance here. The rules of economics are the same as they've always been, and the number of snake oil salesmen, as deomonstated by this book, continues to increase.Save your money."
5,"Pro-One Performance ""Pro-One Mini Contoured Mirrors","Great shape to these mirrors. They are tight, no vibration until around 80mph. Look sharp and the bugs seem to come off easier than other chrome up front."
2,Not as good as their previous work....,"Run-DMC no doubt have a legacy in this game, they changed the rules,saved aerosmith's career and went gold, platinum etc.And now they're back..what a mistake!! the cd is wack, you barely seem JMJ work on it and there's too much colaborations ( fred durst, kid rock, meth, big pun, nas..)and the result is disapointing.4 or 5 songs out of 12 really impressed me so it's less than half the cd...I like& respect run-dmc but they should retire..they r trying to prove that they still can burn the mic and rock the crowd, but times changes and they should now about it..."
5,Old school reborn! --- With a new sound!,"Run DMC, a trio that has been around so long, and returning in the 2000 era with the same winning shine that rings with an old-school sound mixed with modern hip-hop. With plenty of guest appearences such as fred-durst and sugar ray (etc.), this album really represents Run DMC's royal position. Since the days when they were one of the very first to come out of no-where with the fresh genre of hip-hop, it has only grown! They well earned their crown of royalty, and it seemes as if they have been resurrected! They are back, and with tight old-shcool rhymes and beats that truly own! Check this album out today!"
2,2 for THe Group -2 for this Mess,Run Dmc deserves better than this Mess.this is By the Numbers Product.all the MTV Crowd here to Help Run DMC OUT??RUn DMC would never go out like this back in the day.this is a Sad Listen to a Group who is as Important as any other Rap Act in it's History.CLiche Music&The Force of this Group is Missing in Action.Avoid at all Costs&Get the Old Stuff.
4,Pretty Good,I don't understand why this has gotten such bad reviews it really is a good cd. Maybe to true run fans this might be a step down but compared to recent albums that have come out this has been the most unique. It doesn't come close to Jurassic 5 but Crown Royal mixes good lyrics with rock and some good beats.
2,Where is Blood is Pumpin??,"The best part of this movie is the dance club shootout, and before the actual shootout they play the song Blood is Pumpin(Cold Blood Remix) which is one of the best techno songs ever, and it's not even on this CD!! Disapointment!"
2,"I own it, but not a huge fan","Like most, i was looking for the more electronic side, and most the music on the album has nothing to do with the movie. Everyone wants to know the song from the club scene, but im curious as to what the song from the big fight scene is? any help?"
1,RE: Missing Track,"The club scene song is actually Voodoo and Serano's Blood is Pumpin'. You may be right about the fight scene, but that is the name of the song for the club scene. They have their own disk which is really good, I own it:) And you can find Blood is Pumpin' on a number of compulations as well. I hope this is helpful to anyone that likes that song as much as I do although I knew about the song before it was in Blade 2."
2,Rap & Rock,This cd sux. I am a fan of almost everybody on this cd but the only good tracks are Marco's blade theme and I against I from Mos Def and Massive attack.
3,Do not put on upper eye/eyelid,I can't tell a huge difference yet w/my under eye area. I've tried almost every product and the jury is still out on this one. Definitely do not put on upper eye area/eye lid. It caused a rash for me.
5,"Lost Hunger, A great book to read",I have read Lost hunger atleast 20 times now and I do believe that this is one of the greatest novels. I love the way that Ms. Robinson told this story. So far to my knowledge this is by far the greatest book and I recommend it for any person whether he or she is into Vampires or not. So come and read this excelent novel. I can't wait till II & III.
1,Bad product,Anyone who even carries this product is evil!View tips and guidelines | Title & 4 more words required.View tips and guidelines | 1 more word required
1,Nice try....,"Look, I'm actually not a fan of Moore. I liked him better when he was after big business and corporate scams. Does he take quotes out of context? Yeah. Is he a bit of a blowhard with an inflated ego? Yeah. Do I agree with the gist of what Farenheit 9/11 was all about? Damn straightThis war was wrongThe Iraqi people never threatened my people outside of their own country, Osama is our enemyWe are there for oil, nothing moreBush is one of the worst presidents in this nation's historyThere you have it"
5,Thank God,Thank God there are people who are willing to tell the truth to the public about the lies of Michael Moore. Hopefully Michael Moore's views never become main stream or we are all doomed. I could only hope a terrorist drops a bomb on his doorstep. Unfortunatley they are probably more likely to send him flowers.
1,Horrible movie,"After seeing Michael Moore's Farenheit 9/11, I wanted to see something that was giving a different perspective to his claims -- this film was not it. All it is is a series of interviews with Ann Coulter and many other Conservatives. There is no actual evidence shown. If you are looking for films to give an alternate opinion on Michael Moore's work tryMichael Moore Hates Americainstead."
1,Slim on Significance,"This looking-glass view of generally insignificant details from Moore's film and its almost frantic attempt at discrediting it or Michael Moore himself, appears more like (more) sour grapes at the phenomenal success of ""Fahrenheit 911"" than anything else. Not worth the time, unless you are really desperate for an alternative view to the generally thorough and fairly well substantiated essence of the Cannes award winning hit."
4,Great lantern,"Pros: The lantern is very bright, starts easy great. It's lasted a long time. The hard case has enough room for extra mantels and a box of matches.Cons: The instastart is useless, but it still has match holes so keep a book in the hard case. The threads connecting to the propane tank aren't very good. It's easy to get cross threaded and they are soft so if you aren't careful you can ruin them. When it starts to thread, you have to stop and double check everything to make sure it's going on strait.Conclusion: It has some issues forcing you to be careful with it and pack matches with you. But from what I've seen it's still the best super bright lantern I've found."
1,Poor design and quality control,"The quality control on this lantern is extremely poor. The piezoelectric starter produces a usable spark perhaps one out of seven pushes, making lighting this an exercise in frustration. I ended up lighting it with a match the first time and getting a sore thumb on subsequent attempts to start it with the push button. The threaded coupling is cocked at an angle, leaving the lantern leaning on an otherwise perfectly straight propane cylinder. The regulator knob has a very sloppy feel and a finite number of poorly placed levels rather than the smooth, continuous settings on my 10 year old Coleman dual mantle lantern. Last but not least, the regulation of the gas flow is very poor at the higher settings, producing a sputtering sound and an annoying, flickering light. This lantern uses a single, accordion shaped mantle that will require you to stock spares specific to that lantern. Avoid this product and stick with the older design."
3,"Bright, but starter is a joke.","This is a good lantern, with an effective carry case. It's too bad that Coleman opted for such a Mickey Mouse igniter. It flat out doesn't work. After I manually light it, the lantern is great. Too bad, it would have been a five star review if not for the faulty starter."
2,Not a great instructional video,"Camera work was excellent--and Nathan can sure as heck ride. The chapter titles seemed to indicate that this would be an excellent instructional video for the intermediate level rider. However, not a lot of thought was given to the content beyond laying-out the chapters. He does not give many helpful insights for the beginner or even indtermediate rider. The way he discusses the whoops are a good example of this. He shows you how to blitz through the whoops at 35-40 mph riding a wheelie. I will probably never be at that level, and someone who is does not need this video. Great video if you want to see someone who can really ride a bike do his thing. However, not great if you are looking for a solid beginner to intermediate instructional video."
1,Don't Waste Any time with this a waste of $$$$$,"OK why can't DIC leave sailor moon alone.... So if you want sailor moon season1uncut on dvd get the boxset thats out.i'll give advfilms 10stars for realsing it. Dic destroyed the real sailor moon.... yes im a fan of orginal sailor moon, super gals, Sakura Wars, Tenchi, Rayearth, Blue Seed,Cardcaptor sakura, Inuyasha, Mao-Chan, Sister Princess, Mini-Goddess, and Saint tail, and Ranma1/2 If you want to see Sister Princess go to www.animekrazy.com for the boxset. *not sold in stores*"
3,Not perfect -- but worth a look for Holmes fans,"This 2003 BBC ""Hound"" has some flaws -- in particular the poorly done digital hound -- but the director/screenwriters have taken some interesting liberties with the Conan Doyle classic. Making Holmes and Watson younger (and possibly gayer) than the traditional characters is a bold choice. Also, their incorporation of historically accurate Victorian era elements -- like a fascination with the occult (Conan Doyle himself was a true believer) -- adds some spice as well. In sum, the film is not a replacement for reading the original; but if you've read the classic, the film gives you something to ponder over a cup of tea."
2,Too basic,"Good idea, but unless you are a complete novice you will find yourself skipping lots of pages and sections. Don't buy this if you are looking to advance your skills beyond very basic stuff. This is for a real beginner."
1,Take a moment and vomit up your lunch,"New Age drivel. In addition to being patently false, her theory conveniently allows her to avoid any compassion for anyone experiencing tragedy of any sort, she will simply say they WISHED tragedy into existence."
3,Music -Motion Picture-Princess Mononoke,My son did'nt like the music CD from the movie as much as he enjoyed the Symphony CD.
3,Good but some flaws.,"I got this camera around two months ago and it is great, except for one flaw. There is something wrong with the flash, it is programmed to be on but there is no flash ever. It ruins the whole picture usually. I need help, or I might as well throw this camera away."
2,Doesn't like cold weather!,"I bought this, my first digital camera, to document the building of my new house. It worked reasonably well at first, but when winter closed in and the builders were still hard at work, my camera wasn't. Every time I turned it on it immediately turned off again. For a while after that it still worked okay indoors, but eventually I had the problem regardless of the temperature. Occasionally if I kept turning it on I won the battle and it would stay on and take a reasonably good picture, but the next time I wanted to use it I would have to go through the same hassle. I have seen good reviews of other Kodak products, but I won't buy another. I've just replaced the camera with a Nikon S700 and the difference, both in quality of the pictures and in ease of use (make that possibility of use) is incredible."
5,GREAT CAMERA!!!,I am an amature at picture taking but I am a new mommy and I wanted a digital camera for shooting and e-mailing pics. I have not been disappointed with this camera it is very user friendly and takes AWSOME pictures EVEN IN LOW LIGHT(there is a feature that automatically brightens your pictures in low to no light). This camera is worth every penney and I couldn't be happier. I also have the dock printer which seems to develop better than ANY developing place I have ever used...I am normally not a big spender because Im a FT student but this is worth your money.
3,Doesn't stay put very well,I ordered the pillow because I needed some extra support to help with arm strain. The pillow is a good height but doesn't wrap around so it has a tendency to slide forward.
5,Gershwin Done Right!,"I love all of the CDs I own that feature Leonard Bernstein as pianist and conductor. Under Mr. Bernstein's baton, the New York Philharmonic delivers a plush version of Mr. Gershwin's two works. I highly recommend this CD to those who love George Gershwin's music."
5,Gershwin/Bernstein: Rhapsody In Blue and American In Paris,"In my opinion you just can't go wrong with Leonard Bernstein and the New York Philharmonic Orchestra. I have many of their recordings in addition to many recordings of other orchestras; some great, some not so much...but the New York Phil is cosistently great. This recording is a superb example of Gershwin's writing, thoughtfully reproduced by a fine orchestra. Both the brashness of the pieces and the subtleties are interpreted well by Mr. Bernstein and the orchestra. The soloists are nothing other than excellent. The brass section is easily as strong as the Chicago symphony's famous section, and the strings intonation is superb. The pathos and the humor of both pieces are readily projected by this sensitive orchestra and conductor. I couldn't recommend this recording higher!"
5,movie #2,"so sake and kurumi go out to a small town. but doctor amagi gets kidnaped in the prosses plus 3 angels show up tsunmi,hitoco and somthing elese any way there after kurumi plus another angel shows up kuranka. and she beats up sake well kurumi find her before its to late like i sade before youll have to see and watch"
4,Excellent,Do we always choose people that remind us of our parents? An interesting look a marriage & friendship. And how the past does not have to dictate our present.
2,Gate closer,"Well built, it can make your gate opening and closing easy. The bolts are of a very poor construction. When I tightened the nut up the threads stripped out. After that I had to cut the bolt in two to remove it so I could replace it."
5,Totally Awesome,"This was my first taste of Anubis Gate and wow, I can't get enough. This album grabs your nape and doesn't let go. I will be buying more CDs from this band. If you are a progressive/Scandiavian metal fan...this one is a must!"
3,OK For What I needed,"The biggest negative to this book is the lack of color illustrations. This disappointed me. It would have been nice, in the chapter on birds, to show how color is applied, and what finishes to use.After reading this, I realized this book is just about carving wood. Wood is wood. You can stain it, paint it, using oils or anything else that sticks to wood. This not about canvas, or glass. The authors use a conversational style, which I liked.The initial publication was in 1983, before digital photography. The publisher is Dover, and they have a reputation for good books at a low price."
4,a good book for starting off,"This book is a good book for the beginner. It has alot of good information for someone staring off in wood carving. the best way that I can explain this. It shows you wish tools to use depending on what your looking to do and it provides alot of good tips. I couldn't give this book a better rating at this time, because I'm still in reading the book, but for what I have read and look at through the book I feel that a four star is a good rating."
1,:o(,"I was disapointed in this book. It did not meet my expectations at all. My own ideas are better, and using found wood on top of that."
3,Works Fine,"It is a decent stopwatch. Doesn't do anything out of this world, but if you need some laps timed it will do the trick."
4,Nice big display,"Easy to use, big easy to read display, useful functions. Good deal for the price. Hoping it lasts for at least a couple of years."
4,nearly perfect,"I use this stopwatch for work in research, and it replaced a bunch of cheaper stopwatches. This stopwatch is perfect for this purpose. It has a nice size/weight, feeling solid and professional. As far as I can tell, it's quite accurate, and it has a nice range of features.The only problem that I have with it is that there's no option to turn off its incessant beeping with every button-press.Conveniently, though, one can take off the back panel and move a small piece of electrical tape (conveniently provided by the manufacturer), and the speaker is disconnected.Overall, very happy."
3,Not bad...,Taste the same. But you inhale lighter. The tar really gross me out. I just want to quit already when i saw the black tar on the filter!
1,GO OUT AND BUY SEASON2 UNCUT ON DVD!,Just to let you guys all know you can be Sailor MoonR uncut on DVD. ITs alot better to. So if you want it uncut buy sailor moonR uncut on DVD Thank you. I have all The episodes to including Sailor Stars.
2,needs help,"""Carmina Burana"" is a great piece of music. It will stand the test of time. However, this is a very poor recording. In many places the volume is so low that you can hardly hear it. It is so bad I will have buy a better and different CD of ""Carmina Burana""."
5,Pokemon EX Kit (Plusle And Minun),"I Bought The Pokemon EX Kit From The Seller ""Collector's Cache"" And I Must Say It Was Very Well Packaged. The Shipping Was Quick And Arrived Early. As For The Kit Itself, It Did Not Disappoint. It's A Great Way For Beginners To Get A Grasp Of The Game And Comes With A Balance Of Psychic And Fire Pokemon (If You Want A Spoiler, E-Mail Me. If You Want It To Be A Surprise, Then Buy It, Definitely Recommend). Of Course, The Kit Comes With A Fire Red/Leaf Green Booster That Contains 9 Extra Cards And A Plusle And A Minun Holographic Card, For A Total Of 69 Cards. The Kit Also Contains A Pokemon Coin (Which The Design Varies), A Rule Book, Damage Counters, And A Playing Mat. Overall, This Is A Great Kit To Buy, And I Would Also Recommend The ""Pokemon Heart Gold/Soul Silver Kit"" That Contains Gyarados And Raichu In The Cover, It Was Also A Great Buy. =)If You Want Anymore Information About The Pokemon EX Kit, Then Don't Hesitate To E-Mail =D"
2,Look for LIVING the Cross Centered Life,The author's other book Living the Cross Centered Life is a wonderful life-changing book! This one seems like the first edition and was a disappointment to me.
5,"Wonderful, SEXY, HOT, romantic, Outstanding!","I just love this movie! Outstanding actors and the writer/director and star Casper Andreas is the most sexiest guy I've ever seen. SO HOT! I also like Virgina Bryan who play Marilyn, she is marvellous, so funny. You just have to see this movie and the extras are fantastic."
2,Not very good.,"The movie is rather boring in many parts and in fact two of us watching this movie fell asleep during it. The characters are plastic, and the story predictable. The only thing that could have saved this movie was a little skin, and that never made it to the screen either."
2,Don't be fooled by the title,"One thinks by the cover and the description that it would be a comedy, but it turns into a self help drama fast. The characters are the typical chisled pretty gay boys that run around saying wo is me. The acting is okay, a bit over dramatic at times, reminds me of some high school drama productions, or maybe the actors are all stage actors and feel the need to over project.Oh and the major problem of the movie is the problems with continuity...Look it's the magical shirt that goes from tan to blue in less than a second! Watch the amazing piece of toast that has multiple bites taken from it that never gets any smaller!"
3,"Cute boys, poor acting, ok plot","This movie picked some good actors and teels a fun story, but the acting is a bit subpar. Still a fun eyecatching movie."
2,painfully romantic playing of baroque masterpieces,"One does not have to play on gut strings with no vibrato to give a decent performance of a baroque violin concerto. But when two performers as talented as Zuckerman and Stern make not a single concession to the stylistic necessities of early music, it becomes a painful listening experience. They slog through these pieces with wide, impassioned vibrato and huge sound, and it simply doesn't work. The tempi are slow, the orchestra is a bit sloppy, and the overall effect is like watching a hippo in a mud bath. Absolutely no stylistic integrity. Skip this one."
1,Durable? I think not...,"I read every single review for every speed rope available on amazon.com. I thought that I would make an intelligent decision and buy this rope based on the positive reviews from others.What they said was true. It is good for people 6'0 tall and it can be adjusted. It looks nice and has a nice rubber rope cover.I put this rope to its test and was doing fast double jumps, tricks, etc...At first I thought this rope was perfect. I was finishing up my casual warm up when the rope snaps in two and hits me on the face. Outside that black cover is an incredibly thin rope ( clever using cheap material inside? ) .I am pissed of now because I need to continue my workout so I put duck tape over it, and will use it temporarily. Now I am going to order an everlast rope. I hope it doesn't suck as much as this one."
4,Simple and effective,"Adjusting the ropes is a bear, but afterward... no issues at all and smooth bearing movement."
3,Just a wee bit Hokey,"I'm embarassed to admit it but I was a huge ELO fan as a child. I spent a lot of time in my room in New Jersey hoping a spaceship would hover over my housing tenament and ""throw me down a line."" Even today I find it hard to resist classics like ""Can't Get It Out Of My Head"" and ""Overture."" Time was certainly a well crafted album musically. I just found the theme (along with the lyrics) a little childish. I guess I had outgrown the fellas by then but lyrics like ""with my brand new time transporter"" pretty much ruined the album for me. I did enjoy ""Hold On Tight."" I even liked Lynne's solo album ""Armchair Theatre"" but this one was just a bit too ridiculous even for a nerd like me."
3,Pretty Good Video for beginner children,"I was enthused to find an instructional video for Violin beginners. To my chagrin, it is very short and is limited in scope and depth. I can see the benefit for parents and children to watch it together to see if this instrument is something your child would like to pursue, along with some rudimentary information, but as an instructional video, it falls short.There is also one problematic piece in this tape; the teacher refers frequently to the ""red"" and ""green"" dots for finger placement. It isn't until the end of the tape that one learns what he is referring to.But I would like to reiterate that there is value in this video for children and their parents to open up discussion as to whether the child wishes to begin violin lessons."
3,first one didnt work,"its a very cheap, basic mower but after recieving the first one, which didnt work amazon had to send us out another. It cuts the grass, but its by no means fancy."
4,Great machine.,This mower I bought is more then I hoped for. It's easy to start and cuts great and putting it together was easy and quick.
1,Yard Machines still has not shipped my mower!,"Yard Machines and Amazon still have not shipped my order yet. Nothing. If I had known the item was not going to ship in a reasonable amount of time, I would have ordered it from Wal-Mart or a different site."
1,Yard Machine - HORRIBLE,1ST USE - THOUGHT THIS WAS GOING TO BE A GREAT MOWER. AFTER 1ST USE - IT'S BEEN NOTHING BUT TROUBLE. WON'T START - BACKFIRES - WON'T CONTINUE RUNNING. HAD TO TAKE IT TO THE AUTHORIZED REPAIR SERVICE AFTER 1 USE. THEY SAID IT WAS THE SPARK PLUG (WEIRD FOR A NEW MOWER) & I HAD TO PAY FOR THE NEW SPARK PLUG. HASN'T WORKED ANY BETTER AFTER THAT. STILL BACKFIRES. NOW WON'T EVEN START AGAIN. THIS MOWER IS GARBAGE!!!!
3,Read Specs CLOSELY,"Mower is fine, however i only read about ''wheels adjust '' and i didnt read that this is manual--meaning take the dang wheels off each time and reinstall.....dont buy this from Amazon--go to Home Depot and for 10-15 dollars more get one ASSEMBLED and with wheel adjustments via levers...but the machine itself does fine.....Amazon should notate in huge letters about wheel adjustmenst and should specify this is a lenghty assembly.....am so unhappy this is prolly my last Amazon purchase and i do stress that we all should go to retailers before buying something corded or mechanical."
2,"Thanks, Amazon","I was disappointed that this machine didn't offer the chance to compare my own rating with those who gave it 5 stars. When trying to assemble it I found that the handle was 2"" too wide for the body - apparently it was the wrong handle for this model. And mulching would have been impossible since the side discharge chute was not closeable. I was also surprised to find that the mower was not returnable, something I could not find noted on the item description even when I went back and looked again.That said, Amazon was very helpful in taking care of the problem. I was able to reach a customer service rep quickly and talk by phone. My complaint was resolved very well. Some have posted with frustration about Amazon's customer service, I don't understand where the problem was. I had no trouble at all."
3,Rick Steve's out of date guidebook for Asia,"Similar to Europe through the Back Door, this is Rick's attempt for Asia. The book gives general advice for those who want to backpack through Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, India, Japan, etc... The advice is very similar to those found in Rick's other books: wear a money belt, mix with the locals, don't expect 5 star cleanliness in a cheap hotel etc... The book is not bad, but it's main flaw is that it is dated material. I do like/trust Rick's opinions so I use it, along with other guidebooks, for travel ideas through Asia."
3,Good enough...,"This sewing kit is very basic but it is good enough to get the job done. I went to the store and added some stronger needles, the ones it came with were very small and hard to work with; and a nicer thimble helps too."
3,"Great idea, fun light, but doesn't seem to last.","My 6 year old son received one of these from some friends of ours. It was a few years old at the time. He loved it and used it every day for about 2 weeks until it quit working. I found this one which looks identical and was reasonably priced, so I ordered it for him. He uses it as a nightlight. It lasted a few months and then quit working. It would be nice if you could just buy the bulb and replace it. Still deciding if I'll buy another one and try to get my son to use it more sparingly."
3,Pretty Cool - when it works.,"Bought one, plugged it worked flawlessly for maybe 15seconds. It then only glowed white at the bottom and stank up the room with smoke. Not exactly an inspiring performance for something which should be left on all night while your kids are sleeping, eh?Have a new one in my hands which works thus far, we'll see how it goes. Very cool, and I know my sons will love it."
1,All Design and No Function,I love Rowenta products and have been extremely pleased with everything I own from this manufacturer. My last Rowenta toaster lasted over 10 years without any problems. However the Morrison designed toaster stopped working after only 1 year of light use. I am extremely disappointed considering the price of this toasterJasper Morrison Toaster by Rowenta Germany.
1,"First one died after a year, got a free replacement, then it died after a year","I think my title pretty much says it all: this toaster is overpriced junk. (Looks great, though!)"
3,Jasper Morrison Toaster - still wanted,"Hi,We have been generally satisfied to this Rowenta toaster for 4 years.But now it is also broken, and repairing seems to be almost impossible, because there are no spare parts available anymore, or not good enough spefications about the components used in printed circuit board. But if I could get working toaster I could evaluate needed components from that.So I would like to buy used (working) or new Jasper Morrison (Rowenta) toaster (type number TL-900030/13 or similar) to review used components. Or I would need at least information about quite big tube like green component, which might be resistor. In my toaster this component has burned so badly that it does not have any printing on it anymore.Also component list or schematics of the circuit board would be enough.Br,Ismo"
4,Toaster,The toaster is well-designed and contemporary. It works well and very nice hidden buttons and features.
4,Pretty Good for the price,"We bought this gate when my daughter was a baby and installed it at the top of our stairs almost four years ago. Our stairs are about 4 or 5 feet wide at the top and it was close to impossible to find a gate that would keep our loft area safe for my daughter to play in. My dad mounted the gate to metal railings and it has held up beautifully over the years. It is easy to latch and unlatch, can be removed easily (with the exception of the mounting hardware) and swings out of the way when children are not playing. The only reason I gave four stars instead of five is that it feels a little flimsy when it is latched because it gives a little either way. The gate has never failed on me and actually is very secure despite the shaky feel. This gate can't be beat for the price and security it offers."
4,No monkies please,"This is a great gate if your child is not a climber. It is rough on the wall mount if your child likes to hang, we have had to reinstall to resecure it. Reversable so when open it can stand flat against the wall."
3,As far as gates go this one will do.,"I have a 60"" or 5' opening I needed to gate off and this looked like the only one that would work. I suppose it's okay. We had to buy some longer screws then what came with it, plus 2 planks of wood to mount on the wall cause it kept coming off. Oh by the way, you have to mount it to the walls in case you don't read the brief description; I did not. It takes a while to break it in, so it sticks and you need both hands and maybe a foot to get the gate to retract. And watch for little fingers of course."
2,NOT for multiples!,We have twins and ease of use was just as important as the fit. This thing DOES NOT slide easily! It swings open very well but if you need it to slide before you swing it good luck. I am not tall enough to climb over this gate and have to use it a million times a day. I am very dissapointed with this gate and will be taking the other three I purchased back!
4,Awesome Gate,"My nine month old gets into everything. My biggest problem is between the dinning room and kitchen where the entry is about 4feet wide. My son kept crawling in the kitchen and picking up the ant traps we had placed in the corner. It was very hard to find a gate wide enough with a good review so I tried this one. It only took about 20 minutes to mount. I find it very easy to use and very child proof. Now until he figures out he can go around to the other side, I'm good."
3,Great for larger spaces... but can be tricky...,"This was the only gate we could find that would telescope out to the space at the top of our stairs in our older home. It was very stable and worked adequately, with a couple of notable exceptions:This gate was simple to open and close--- only when I WASN'T carrying a baby. It's definitely NOT the easiest gate to operate with one hand.Along those same lines, it wasn't always easy to telescope in and out when I was holding my son... and there are so many panels on it, that even when I WAS able to push it back, it was thick enough that it would never get completely out of my way.Again, it's not a bad gate--- when we moved out of our home we donated it to our daycare facility--- where it seems to be working fine (because there are several people around to help when it needs to be open and closed)."
5,A Classic ...(and then something more),"This album made me a fan, a thinking mans heavy metal album that does not gives you a dull moment. From Fire of Unknown Origin and climaxing with Joan Crawford, this album will make a fan out of you. Sure, Imaginos is also an excellent album, but the songs here are more appealing to the newcomers and will pave the way for you to get the whole BOC collection. There is not a weak link in the album and both melodies and lyrics are both catchy and plain excellent. Get this one!!!!"
5,awesome!!!!,This slow cooker is so fun since you can watch your food cooking! My roast literally fell apart; I cooked it from 7:30a.m. until 4:00p.m on low. Would highly recommend this; don't hesitate to buy it!
4,Great,"Really love this record. There's a raw quality to it, though it's production is top-notch, but that's part of the appeal. Alex Nackman writes notable lyrics and melodies that stick. Admittedly, I like this release better than the one that came after it a year later. It's got pop, rock, and electronic production elements and it's a release I find myself listening to frequently."
3,Loved it then...,"I hated the ending. The last episode reminded me of so many other series who want to go out with some kind of traumatic ending that will leave you scarred for life. Many of us still remember the MASH episode where the mother smothers her baby because it is crying and will give them away to the enemy. I know terrible, horrible things happen in real life, it is all over the news everyday, but for crying out loud, can't we have a heroine who has weathered all, been up against seemingly impossible odds and still come out on top, be gloriously victorious in the end? Do we have to have Lilly's agonizing death replaying over and over in our minds? Hell on Wheels might have another season, but I won't be watching. My interest died with Lilly."
3,Pretty good series,"This series starts off strong, but gets a little tiresome after the first season. Relies on fight scenes too much, feels a little predictable sometimes. Characters are interesting, acting is generally fine."
5,One amazing western!,I have been watching westerns for many years. This is actually the very first western series that I have watched and I do have to say it is AMAZING! Excellent characters and story keeps the pace of this series moving along like a freight train!
5,Great show.,I missed the second season due to Dish Networks riff with the network. I watched the entire season in a week.
5,"Awesome show, awesome cast","If you haven't seen this show, tune in now, or video on demand it here on Amazon. You won't be disappointed. Always action packed and Anson Mount is amazing!"
5,Is Closed Captioning available on this?,"I LOVE Hell on Wheels and was excited to see Season one be available on Netflix. Unfortunately, Season Two isn't nor is it on Hulu. I would very much like to access Season Two here but need to know if it's available in Closed Captioning. Can anyone verify?FYI - they just signed an agreement to begin filming Season Three :)"
3,"A good read, but it wanders","I found this book entertaining...but also thought there were times where it wander. Wait is it 1955 of 1968. Is the author writing about Mexico, Utah, Montana, or Nevada...she truly does float along without using time references.I did enjoy the total story, and I had read several of the other books about the topic."
3,Polygamy Review,Somewhat disappointing-not as much about polgamy as I expected given what you hear-except for multiple mothers she seems to have lived a normal life.Not as much scandal as in other books on polygamy.It does however give more of an insight between the meaning of mormonism and polygamy.
3,Smell is too strong,"I found the product to be effective for its stated purpose, but discontinued use due to the overpowering odor. Reminds me of an old fashion barbershop."
5,Great find,Oakley is the product to buy for any one needing quality i am so glad that they are dedicated to providing me with a good product
2,Looks great but is not strong at all,"I bought this product because it was not only very good looking, but also I thought it would be able to properly protect my glasses, which were a substantial investment. On the first use, I put it in a carry-on suitcase for a flight, but unfortunately when I took it out, the case was extremely bent. Luckily my glasses were fine, but still I was able to see that the actual metal portion is paper-thin. If you still decide to get one, but just know that it is not heavy-duty whatsoever."
5,Its an oakley,what else to be said? Oakley has made fine products since ever! this is my third large vault and it suits the task! I also have a small vault... too many sunglasses already...
5,WORTH THE COST,BOUGHT THIS FOR MY DAUGHTER AS A GIFT AND SHE LOVES IT SHE WAS ABLE TO FIT TO PAIRS OF GLASSES IN THE CASE. SHE IS IN THE ARMY SO HER STUFF GETS TOSSED AROUND ALOT AND THE CASE HAS STOOD UP TO THE TEST
5,poignant and illuminating expose of young women,"Audrey Shehyn's ""Picture the Girl"" provides a poignant and illuminating expose of young women as they negotiate their teenage years. The revealing portraits and first person accounts of 36 girls offer insight and surprisingly familiar wishes and fears. Women will see themselves reflected back in sometimes disturbing yet always refreshing and wiser-than-their-years self-depictions. The photographs speak wonderfully to each individual girl, complementing their words in a remarkably fitting way. This book is for mothers, fathers, and teachers who want to understand their children or students, girls who will take comfort in shared experiences, women who are still coming to terms with their own difficult but hopefully carefree teenage years, as well as anyone interested in an honest view of girls and the unique issues they face today. If nothing else, buy it for the deeply personal photographs by the talented Shehyn."
2,Is Mead listening? Are they still solvent?,"My story is much like the others here. Filled with enthusiasm, andout $400, I sadly returned my first MySky after a few days due to general malfunction.Mead's service was slow and showed lack of caring for the customer.I returned the second unit after a one week, and got a refund.Good points: The MySky screen is in color and easy to point and shoot.The problem is that this product is half baked. It's a toy. They usedcheap materials combined with poor quality control.A little research gave me the impression of a company in trouble with weak management and no vision.DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.PS I bought the CelestronIt works, but its boring, and no way cool like the MySky should have been.I wouldn't purchase either product if I could do it over.What a disappointment!"
2,nice attempt at a biogrpahy without the actual writings of the emperior,"A hnonorable attempt at writing a biography by using secondary resources to support his writings. The Japanese government does not allow people to review the emperior writngs, so we are left with other writings from his colleagues to make a analysis on his character."
3,hopefully give some thoughts to the Japanese,"As mentioned in the book, the Japanese has long been downplaying the role of the wartime Emporor Hirohito throughout the past half century. Without accepting Hirohito's responsibility in the second world war, the Japanese will never accept thier war time quilt as a country either.As a chinese, I would highly recommend the Japanese to read this book. The reason is that the book doesn't really review much surprising secrets of the war time quilt of Hirohito/Japan, so it would not be a very rewarding reading for readers of the western world with abundant information about the war. But for the Japanese, as every one knows, they like to ""alter"" their history in a way that they don't even admit the happening of the Nanjing Massacre incident happened in China during the WWII, by reading this book, which is quite an objective piece of work, it is hoped that the Japanese can begin to accept the true history, not thier conjured-up version."
5,the ultimate jesse cook,"simply stated. if i want to lie back and chill out, i listen to ottmar or govi. but if i want my blood to boil, jesse cook has to be my choice. i have made my own compilation of all of jesse's cd's and have titled it ""boiling"". no artist past or present has effected me more than jesse cook, and i was born in 1937. jack stanley"
5,Jesse Fan for 15+ years!!!,"How can someone review a CD without listening to it?? I'm a Jesse Cook fan for over 15+ years and he never ceases to amaze me. I have every one of his CDs and love every one!!! His newest CD ""Rumba Foundation"" is his best ever, but every song on this compilation is of course, his best songs. This CD set would be the best one to buy for someone who hasn't really heard him before, it is a wonderful range of songs through his earlier sets and it will not cease to please the listener. I highly recommend this to a new fan of Jesse Cook!!!"
5,"""The Ultimate Jesse Cook""","This two-CD Set of the most scintillating, spendorus music I've ever heard is a dream come true. I can't stop listening to them."
1,Just plain cheap.,"I got this as a gift and didnt like it right away. It felt cheap, doesnt seem to have enough pressure to make espresso. Instead it appears to make just a 1/4 cup of coffee. Usually in espresso because its under pressure, you get a almost dark, baby poop brown liquid or foamy substance that comes out with the espresso. With this one it just comes out like normal coffee. The controls for steam are lame. It has an adjustment knob but the steam only goes on when its cranked all the way to high. Thats it, no medium or low steam. Because only the high steam seems to work you end up with a cup of just foam real quick. Im going back to my cheapo mr coffee espresso maker. It makes it just fine and is less than half the price of this one."
1,Delivered Used,"Well I ordered this machine for the great price it was and what do you know, when I opened it up it had dried, crusted cream on the frother and the flask was also dirty, and drops of water inside the chamber. So to say the least I wasn't to pleased with this purchase."
4,Krups FND111 expresso maker,This a good machine for the price. Make sure to usecoarse ground coffee rather than fine. I froth themilk at the very end of the brewing process ratherthan at the beginning as the owner's manual suggests.It even froths light soy milk! Looks very stylishon the counter too.
2,Worked well for a while,"I liked this machine, how it functions, the way the coffee tastes, etc.My problem is that I bought it in Jan. 2006, used it maybe three times a month and now it leaks steam from the sides when I try to make coffee after less than a year and a half.Like someone else said, you get what you pay for."
2,You get what you pay for!,"If you want an inexpensive espresso maker this will work, but you get what you pay for. Its all plastic on the outside and thin guage light weight aluminium. Our old Krups had stout coffee holder and stainless milk foamer and we thought we'd get as good or better but the quality has been stepped down a notch. Too bad krups is cheapening its products."
1,Not really Expresso,"I bought this Krups to replace an old one, but returned it the next day. It does not make expresso coffee....I think the problem is it does not have enough back pressure; the water flows too quickly and the coffeee is just a little darker than normal brewed coffeee."
2,not the quality manufacturing as in the past,"I've had this brand and model for more than ten years. It can make excellent expresso and latte. But the manufacturing quality is now pretty poor. The gasket where the coffee sets sputters and spits water. The selection knob is not so accurate, I have to adjust it so the spring inside is working. Same product but probably made in China and so the quality is very poor.But then it is still better than some of the other low end brands for comperable $$. And it doesn't cost $600. I suppose you could capture that in a year if you bought all your previous coffees at Starbucks."
4,- Not Bad -,"For the price it makes a simple shot of coffee flavored caffine for your mochas/lattes.I use quite a bit of white chocolate mocha powder and hazlenut syrup in my drinks so a french roast is my choice of bean to cut through the syrups for a rich coffee flavor.If I were truly making JUST expresso, this machine would be far less than par.I have to admit, the grounds do seem to get burned from the steam but for my drinks it simply isn't a huge factor.If you want a bit more product go with the DeLonghi EC155 Espresso Maker which has a 15 bar pump otherwise your gonna need to go into the thousand dollar range for truly authentic expresso.Hope this review helps a bit but you have to realize that for truly, authentic, quality expresso ......... the price of entry is much, much higher."
4,Nice little addition to your dorm room,"I have this in my dorm and absolutly love it! However, the first one that was sent to me had a malfunction, but the second one sent works great and i've enjoyed many a latte. The only critique i'd put on it is the frothing nozzle could be a little farther from the machine and also the coverslip on the nozzle makes it difficult to quickly wipe off milk on the actual metal part of the nozzle. This means that upon cleaning you will need to get a choreboy or sos pad to scrape the hardened milk off the nozzle. Other than that, the quality of this machine is great! Enjoy!"
3,I would be more allegro had one piece not broken on the third day,"My old Krups died after valiant service, so, deprived of my elixir, I decided to try another Krups. I read a lot of froth here on the reviews for this model, and proceeded with purchase.Naturally, something as high tech as a cappuccino maker needs to constantly evolve to keep up with the times, so the new machine seemed quite different than our old model. After painful adjustment, and a steep learning curve, we finally succeeded in making our first cup of FND111 cappuccino - it was delicious. It was on the third day of its new life that I got steamed at the soul of my new machine. As I was enjoying the brew with my wife, she fished out from here cup a piece of debris. It was the frother.the FND111 still makes good cappuccino, but its once proud appendage that shot out the special steam is now merely the thin, ordinary appurtenance it was before.But hey, what can one expect, it is only a coffee maker."
4,Great value for the price,"I'm not going to lie, if you want a perfect cup of espresso (and also able to make a perfect cup of espresso), stay away from this one. However, if you're like me and desire a good cup of latte in the morning and refuse to fork over money for over-priced coffee at your local coffee shop, this is a great deal.I've had this thing for about 4 months now and have enjoyed a good cup of latte everyday. Sometimes, I ever find that the stuff that comes out of this thing is actually much better than a cup from Starbucks although that's probably because of the person making that cup of coffee at Starbucks.Everything works great except for the milk steamer which requires careful cleaning after each use. Otherwise, dried milk will build up on that thing and the next thing you know, you might need frequent trips to the bathroom."
2,short lived,"I had another Krups before this one and it was getting old and well used. It still worked ok but I decided I needed to ""upgrade"". Boy was I wrong... about the upgrade part. This new one lasted about 10 - 15 lattes and then poof the valve that switches between brew and steam decided to no longer work. By the time it had stopped working I had already thrown away my old one. The funny thing is I bought my old Krups at a thrift store for 8 bucks at it lasted about 5 years... man I shoulda kept it!"
2,Don't be tempted by the cheap price!,"Do not buy this machine. Not only does it make only a very weak brew, but the steamer wand on mine stopped working properly after less than 4 months! So while at first I thought I could make a second-rate fascimile of a latte (forget about real espresso with a crema), now I can't even do that!The bottom line: if I had to do it over again, I would not buy this machine again; I would spend $50 extra right from the start and buy the entry-level DeLonghi pump machine instead.By the way, no matter what kind of espresso machine you have, make sure always to use a very finely ground of coffee in it -- it'll improve the flavor and consistency of the espresso!"
1,Worst espresso machine we've ever had,"We bought this espresso machine because we had owned the previous Krups model and it was great - served us well for over 5 years, being used daily. So it was a no-brainer to get another Krups when the time came. But this one doesn't compare! It leaks from every seam, sprays steam all over the place, the indicator light has already burned out (after 2 months), and because of the intense leakage it sits in its own pool of water. That seems dangerous to me. We are getting ready to chuck this and go to a different brand."
1,"Returned defective, 2nd one bad too",We returned the 1st one on warranty because the steam/drip dial was not responding. The replacement came and now it will heat the water but only a drop or two comes out. Steam works fine. I'm not spending anymore time on this... going to purchase a more expensive model from a different maker.
1,DO NOT BUY!,"After reading many reviews and desperate for a decent inexpensive espresso machine, I decided to purchase this machine. Well you know the saying ""you get what you pay for"". And indeed I did. It is a plastic piece of junk. I have a friend who has the older model that has a coffee maker and espresso machine in one. It works great. I thought this would be identicle minus the coffee maker. WRONG! It makes weak drip coffee not espresso, you have to wait and froth milk once your coffee is finished or vise versa thus making your coffee cold. The steam doesn't even froth the milk. It has been a complete disaster so save your time and money. I bought the Krups Burr grinder to go along with it and that isn't even great. So long Krups...........I think it's time to spend the money and get the real deal."
2,Okay for the money but takes a while to steam milk,"I bought this machine for the great price but I'm dissapointed with the frothing device. I burned out my older Krups from 2 years of daily use (this is the replacement model), however, the plastic frothing attachment on the steamer arm (which kept the noise down) broke on Day 3 and the steamer takes much longer to froth the milk. Next time I'll spend more money on a higher quality espresso machine. I notice one improvement from the older model, though -- the espresso actually stops pouring when you switch to steaming (the old model continued to dribble down espresso during steaming)."
1,"Made in China, out of plastic. Need I say more?","Well, I will, just because I'm so pissed off about this piece of KRAP. I got this as a Xmas present, and I was SO excited! That is, until I tried to use it! The first time we used it the gasket on the percolation head failed and the machine blew high pressure boiling water and coffee all over me and my husband and made a huge mess of our kitchen. If you are brave enough to try this machine anyway, be sure you always stand away from it or you may get burned!! Also-be sure that you don't turn up the pressure too high on the steam wand because you will get so much froth it will also go all over you and your kitchen. In all, the lesson learned here is, the machine makes decent espresso, but you will pay DEARLY for it! And be sure you buy it from a place that will allow you to return it if it breaks."
4,"Great value, nice styling","A fan of Krups line, I had to return another model due to its tiny basket, but this particular java factory holds plenty of the organic brown motivation powder. It also gets that go-juice in the crafe very quickly compared to other models. However that time saving function is offset somewhat. Getting the sturdy basket and handle into position can be a little daunting, sometimes necessitating tilting the unit to see the groove for insertion. That aside, the black and silver Allegro looks great and makes a great cup a Jose! (espresso isn't really Joe I guess)"
2,Krups Espresso Maker - newest model,"I was disappointed in this product and returned it. This new model of an old standby seemed not to be as well made as earlier models. The coffee bowl did not fit tightly in the maker and steam leaked out. Also the maker recommended that the coffee not be tamped down (as I have been doing for years), and indeed when I tried to tamp the coffee down in the bowl the steam made the coffee spurt up into the coffee maker and made a big mess. When not tamped down, the espresso was weak and not as tasteful. Finally, I did not like the split between the steam function and the espresso making function. All in all, I like the older models better."
2,Not what pictured,My boys ordered this for their dad for Christmas and it does not come with the handle like the picture shows. They were quite disappointed.
2,NOT as listed : The definition of solid,"Solid braid is a solid braid. Not a ""solid"" as in ""tangible on this plane of existence"".Nor is ""solid"" a hollow rope sheath over a core.Yet that's what I purchased from this listing.Short on time, I didn't have the luxury of returning it unfortunately, or I would have; since I was after all looking specifically for SOLID BRAID ROPE.Perhaps for most uses this variety of rope might be perfectly adequate.In fact I will be restringing a block and tackle with it in the morning, since I have so much of it sitting around, yet that is not the intended use I had for it, and my search for solid braid continues...."
1,Crawtator is a no Dill is a so....,Chips were super greasy great for a beer snack but def something I won't be ordering again. Not impressed at all.
5,Full of heartwarming stories,This is a wonderful little book to sit down and relax with. Filled with heartwarming stories - many will stay with you for a long time!
3,"Interesting, a good place to start.","Although the book did have some very beautiful illustrations in it, and did carry rituals for a multitude of occasions, some might find that they do not mesh well with their own systems. Eclectics would find it easy to integrate a few of these rituals into their own routines. I myself, however, found some of them to be either too simple or seeming a bit insufficient for what might be required of an occasion. However, it is an excellent place to start for a beginner,giving a good idea as to how one would create the outline of a ritual, as well as learning a few basic things about the casting of the circle, quarters, etc."
1,Yellow Lab Puppy,"I have a 2 and a half month old yellow lab puppy and he would rather play with his other non scented rope toys. They look the same as this one just different colors but he doesn't really want anything to do with this one. Maybe it's the way it smells but he doesn't chew on it or play with it, he kinda just lets it be where it's at. I even try to play tug-a-war with it with him like I do the other similar toys and he isn't interested."
2,Sturdy enough for a crawler but not easy to use...,We bought this gate to use at the top of stairs because you can screw it into the wall. It seems sturdy enough for my 20 pound crawling 10 month old ...but it is not very easy to open and close. It definitely takes two hands which I don't have when holding my daughter. I am going to return it and buy a gate with a handle that is sturdy at the same time.
3,Superyard XT was a good purchase...,"I am happy with the purchase of the superyard as it is compact enough to be used in the house and large enough to give my daughter plenty of playing room in the yard. The only 2 downfalls is (1) the gate is a bit difficult to fold up, but I am hoping it will loosen up with use; (2) the handle to carry the gate has 2 snaps, if you don't grab the handle correctly the snaps will come undone and the gate will fall. One big plus, the gate came already assembled!"
1,Deemed not safe by manufacturer for my 14 month old!,"This item is intended for use with children 6-24 months old. However, the manufacturer said that it is not safe for use with my 14 month old.This is because my son is able to push the gate anywhere he pleases. I am using the gate on regular carpet--not wood floors or another smooth surface.The manufacturer said my child must be exceptionally big and strong, but my child is below average in weight and only slightly above average in height.The manufacturer refused to give me any kind of refund and said I should try selling it on eBay to recoup my loss. I can't help but feel ripped off. My 14 month old is closer to 6 months than 24 months, and yet he is already too old for this item.Beware of this product!"
5,Safe Haven - Sanity Saver,"I love this gate! It can stand alone or you can add the extentions to it to make it as large as you need. My son plays in this large gated area that has a very open feel to it - he does not feel confined to a small space like the pack n- play. Sometimes he's not even aware he has the boundries around him because he is so busy playing. I can put his favorite toys in the playyard and he is safe as he plays. He has his down time in the playyard too. Sometimes my 4 year old gets in there with him and they play together. The one thing you have to beware of is that when he wants to he can drag it to another area in the room. It is a lightweight gate, however it has never tipped over. This gate has been such a sanity saver that I sent it to my friend who has 2 babies 19 months apart!"
3,My Experience,"I bought this playard for my 15 month old. He liked to climb on the furniture so I bought it to have a safe place for him to play. I really like that you can manuever the sides into different positions to maximize the space you are using it in. However, it is not easy to reposition the sides. I realize this also will keep the child from doing so, but it was still annoying having to fight with it. Also, my four year old was easily able to lift it and crawl under it. We were able to use it for three months successfully before our little climber figured out how to climb the sides."
5,Worth Every Penny!!!!!,"We bought the superyard to use as a barrier between our dinning room and living room. We needed a gate larger than 70in, that didn't put holes in the wall and we couldn't find any. The superyard is so stable my 14month old son can't make it budge. It also comes assembled in the box, so all you have to do is unfold it. Just to warn you it is quite large so may not be good for small spaces. I am so happy we spent the extra few bucks on this gate."
1,Definite Safey Hazard!,"We've had this for less than a year. We were OK with it for a few months, until our daughter got more active. It never seemed all that sturdy. The carpet grips don't work well - at about 11 months, she was able to push the whole thing around. We had been using it for our pets, but recently we were folding it up (never had trouble with that part before) and it broke at all of the hinge areas, leaving many small, very sharp pieces of plastic in the carpet. Beware!"
5,Love it!,"We bought 3 sets... family is buying them also. Great idea for when you have to keep the little ones in a safe space, our twins love being and playing in it"
4,It's OK,"I bought the Superyard when my daughter was 6 months old. We had just bought a house and were remodeling and didn't want her to get into anything. She was crawling already and didn't like being ""penned up"" in her little pack n' play. Besides the fact that she hated it, (She doesn't like to be confined to one area) it worked well. Last Christmas, our daugher was 12 months old and wouldn't leave the Christmas tree alone so we pulled the Superyard out of storage and put it around the tree. For that use alone it was worth it. Like another review has said, Use common sense when using this product. An adult falling on it will collapse it. If your not tall enough to put the child in it safely by reaching over the top, open it up."
4,The untold history of Texas,"Forget about the Alamo, San Jacinto and the heros that have made Texas famous throughout the world. Here are the stories only the real Texans know about. These are the stories my grandmother used to tell me when I was a kid. They carry on the tall-tale tradition and reinforce the Texan image of grandeur and hyperbole."
1,Logitech [Is Not Good]!!,"Buy Logitech webcams at your own risk. I had a terrible experience with Logitech Quickcam pro 3000. The software would install, windows detects the camera, but after rebooting the machine, the camera is just not detected. When I looked at the device in device manager, all it would say was ""Device cannot be started (Code 10)"". Tried it under both Windows 98 and 2000, with the same problems. My advice, go with Intel or 3Com"
3,A bit unsturdy; but birds still come to it...,"I actually purchased this at Wal-mart. I am pleased with this feeder, even though the pole is VERY unsteady due to the fact the pieces do not fit together very well. It will not sustain in high winds; storms;, no matter how deep in the ground that you put it. The pieces of the pole continue to bend in any wind. But besides the shoddy pole; birds still flock to it, especially cardinals. All the time I can see them on it. If you plan on getting a pole feeder, I suggest either getting a different pole, or purchasing a different feeder altogether. It would be best to be a hanging feeder, due to the terrible pole. The feeder itself is great, and very nice for the price."
2,Not one of my favorites,"Although the illustrations in this book are nice, I find the text halting and rather repetitive in a strange way, making it hard to read. The text, as the professional review suggested, is not fluid at all. I think they could have spent less time talking about baking the cookies and put more emphasis on the ""you can do it"" aspect. I don't really enjoy reading it to my son and he doesn't seem to prefer it over any other books."
3,Not my favorite children's book,"I bought this book because my son's name is Samuel and it seemed like a it had a good message. But as someone mentioned earlier, it should have emphasized the title's message more. Plus there is a lot of redundancy in the language. It repeats irrelevant phrases or words. It's rather annoying to read. The illustrations are nice though the mother bear is wearing a green sweater and so initially, looking at the pictures, which the kids pick up on first too, I thought she was a papa bear. Just a little thing. I don't highly recommend this book."
4,Well done,"I believe this video takes an honest look at how the teaching of the Catholic Church compares to what the Bible says. In many cases they do not seem to be saying the same thing. I didn't see anything that was considered to be critical of the Catholic Church as NOT being directly from their official doctrines, or the direct experience of those interviewed, many of whom were, or still are members of the Catholic Church. I think anyone serious about knowing if the Catholic Church's teachings are consistent with Biblical Christianity owes it to themselves to watch this video."
1,Not good at all,Too much propaganda for me. If the interviews were presented unedited it would make this film completely different. There are also mistakes made that the producer has acknowledged but refused to remove them. Those who watch this should take it upon themselves to really look into the claims made about Catholicism.
2,For entry level positions only,"This might be a good book if you are still in law school or only a few years out. However, if you have significant experience and are looking for a new career path, this book offers very little in practical advice. Additionally, for something that is addressed to lawyers (or law students) this book borders on overly simplistic reading that would not be much different than any other ""how-to"" guide about getting your first job. As mine arrived from Amazon damaged, it was returned the same day it came."
1,Total Fraud!,"Please note the spool states ""Nylon"", the description states ""Nylon"" the price is for ""Nylon"".Surprise! The product is not nylon, it's polyester! Poly is much, much cheaper than Nylon.I ordered this on 10/11/12 and got it 10/16/12 for a landscaping project.When i opened the box i noticed the spool says ""Poly"", the item # TN345 is the same as in the ad but it's either a scam by Lehigh or an unbelieveable error on Amazons part.In any case i am returning the item and will find it elsewhere."
4,Provocative commentary,"This is one of Irigaray's best works, I think. It is well-expressed, and her responses to and uses of Descartes, Spinoza and Aristotle all provide a new and useful angle on what is going on in key passages from their works."
2,Too sweet and poor quality,I opened a package of this and the first bite was overpoweringly sweet. I actually had to check the label to make sure I had purchased original and not some other flavor. Despite being too sweet I didn't think it was awful but I was disappointed to find big chunks of fat on many of the pieces of jerky. Would not order again.
4,I am Satisfied,The gauze was recieved on time and carefully packaged.It was exactly as described and it is what I wanted.
4,A truthful depiction of many womens lives.,"I couldn't put this book down, it was a mirror into many lives of black women in the 80's and even today. This story tells about a strong black woman who has had many failed relationships in the past who tries to make this one last.this is a must for anyones' book list."
5,Great Read,A classic by McMillan. I am happy to add this to my collection of one of my favorite authors. Book arrived in excellent condition.
1,Insipid and superficial,"This book unfairly represents women (and men) as shallow, weak, and souless characters. An overwhelming emphasis on the appearances of everything and every person didn't do much to disguise that the book is weak. I really wanted to like it, but the writing was poor and the priorities of the characters which were less than realistic. Let the black writers who are really good writers get published instead of these who fill the troughs of romance novel readers."
4,Good Fun,"This book was one of the first that I had read that portrayed a reasonable male-female relationship without much of the baggage that seems follow many of these relationships. The male had problems dealing with ghosts of the past, the female had problems with her ghosts. Its nice that it has since become a movie. I think the book is a much better journey than the movie."
1,Boring and a waste of time and money,"Definitely geared towards a specific audience. The only reason I finished the book was because I didn't want to waste my money not reading it. 90% of the time I wanted to throw the book down due to disgust at the undeveloped characters.I would not recommend this book to anyone who hasn't been in a really rough relationship who can't see clearly because of ""love"".A much better Terry McMillan book is A Day Late and a Dollar Short."
4,So much better than the movie...,"I watched Disappearing Acts the movie years ago and decided there was no need to read the book. I WAS WRONG!! The movie does the book no justice. Though I had some issues with how the characters handled certain situations I still couldn't put it down. McMillan's character development and real life subject matter kept my interest. Read It, Buy It!"
5,One of best books I have read about 'Nam Division operations,I have a whole new respect for the First Cav and admire anybody who served in Vietnam in combat operations with them. Stanton clearly has done his homework. This one goes on my bookshelf as a keeper. I hope his other books are this good.
4,"It's good, but not amazing","This fits my seat well. I have a Volvo XC60 SUV, and I wanted to protect the seat from my dog's paws. It seems to do that. But the material isn't soft - it's canvas like. I put her bed and blankets on top of the seat cover so she doesn't have to sit on the canvas, and it works fine.Also, the Volvo's seat belts fasten lower than many, so the seat cover can get in the way."
4,Like it,"Fits well with the 2nd row bucket seats in 2004 Toyota Sienna, not that slippery as mentioned in other reviews and keeps the seat and the area clean since lots of hair gets stuck to the cover (little difficult to remove all the hair from the cover when cleaning). Our GS has no problems with it. Would be easier to install/remove if the elastic straps could be tied/velcroed in the back instead of having to slide from the top of the seat."
2,I don't see it...,"I had read reviews and heard great things about this show, but then I watched it and was kind of in awe at how much I disliked it. I was expecting something completely different, which is I guess what was the problem. I just couldn't get past the terrible acting, scripts, the INCREDIBLY high cheese factor. It wasn't the concept that bothered me...I am in love with a show that sounds terrible when summarized (Battlestar Galactica). I think that anything can be made good through good production, directing, scripting and acting. I really didn't see anything in this show but cringe-worthy cheesy moments. I do have some guilty pleasures that are pure entertainment while not being very high quality (Dark Angel, Tru Calling) but I couldn't even be entertained by this. I must be missing something in this show, I just don't get it."
2,Derailed by Sex,"My wife and family started watching season one and loved it until...episode 4. The series quickly became non-stop sex talk, with long scenes featuring erections, masturbation, sex, et al.We stopped watching at this point.Kyle XY had a ton of promise, but was derailed and hijacked by sex."
1,If you are a Richard Boone fan don't waste your time,"This movie was a good idea gone bad. Because of filming problems Boone left the production early and his character, the sheriff, was dubbed. So you are not even enjoying Richard Boone's actual voice. If you must see this, rent it, don't buy it."
1,Pathetic,"An operetta is a musical production in which the songs are crucially important. If the sound is so poor that you hardly hear the singer, how can you possibly enjoy this? A typical Morbisch prodution has pathetic sound, and this Merry Widow is no exception. It is filmed on an outdoor stage with tiny microphones on each performer and it does not work. Act III at Maxim's does not feel Parisian at all. Choreography is poor or non-existent, dances do not flow. This Maxim's feels like an amateur 3-ring circus. There is no feeling between the performers and they are supposed to be in love! This version has tried to add some humor to the dialogue and it fails miserably. This is the very worst performance I have seen of the Merry Widow, either on stage in Europe or on tape. I own an old VHS tape of a Sydney Opera House performance, with Joan Sutherland as Anna, wow!"
2,Sirius One SV1 works but has limitations,"I've got 2 of these receivers and have learned to like them. They both exhibit the same problems: 1. low RF output - I plugged in an external home-made antenna wire, problem solved. 2. dim, small display - don't have a fix for this one, I just live with it. 3. high temps in the vehicle cause the display to blank out, though the radio still works. You can get this gem for about $20 if you shop around and that's about all it's worth. I use it mobile in a company vehicle and it's size and portability make it ideal for my purposes."
2,ditto...Problems Problems,I've had the Sirius One SV1 for almost 3 weeks now and out of nowhere it stopped accepting preset channels and it resets to channel 184 everytime the thing is turned off as well. Just like A. Grant's post (a couple down). As a side note...I had to return my starmate replay the day after I got it because it was an extremely weak FM Transmitter. I had this verified by comparing it to the Sirius One and my friend who has had Sirius since it began a couple years ago has ample experience with the fm presets and all. All the reviews are great for the Starmate so I must have gotten a lemon. They really must be mass-producing these things too fast and forgetting about the quality.
2,Weak and short lived.,"Had originally given a positive review, but then it burned up after 6 months of once daily use.It would 'grind' to a halt on harder beans like robusta. Finally it actually started melting.grind consistency was uniform. The bean hopper may have been antistatic, but the grounds collector certainly was not. Grounds would literally fly all over the place as you poured them out.VERY noisy, especially at 4 a.m.would not buy again, even on sale. Spend the extra money and get something a little beefier (I did)."
2,Works fine for as long as it works,"I purchased this coffee grinder from Costco who replaced my first one no questions asked after it simply stopped working. Problem is, the second one has now stopped working as well. Push the button, nothing happens. Looks like another return to Costco."
4,The Little Giant,"This little jewel seems to function without fault. It is quiet and efficient, producing an even grind without too much static electricity causing ground coffee to adhere to the basket. Sad to say, the bean bin is smaller than I could wish for, requiring refilling every three days. But the grinder is easy to clean, fill, empty and store. I find it an improvement over the La Pavoni I had before."
1,Sticky beans,"In addition to grinding too much coffee for a given cup setting, I had a significant issue with beans getting stuck in the hopper and not continuing to feed into the grinder. I had to repeatedly shake or smack the machine to get the beans to flow again. It went back to the store 2 days later ;-/"
2,Not for fine grind coffee,"The uneven coarse grind is OK for a French press, where the water will stay on the grind for a while. It is not acceptable for a drip coffee maker (especially the MoccaMaster), where the grind needs to be uniformly fine. The company was unable to offer any useful suggestions. Mine goes into the trash this week, after a year of trying."
3,Decent burr grinder,"I think we can all agree that this is not a top-notch barista-quality machine, but this is a pretty good grinder for the $$. I used it for about 8 months until some grounds got into the area where the safety switch is depressed when the plastic cover is on, then it went bye-bye. I felt like it had pretty consistent grinds and used it mainly for espresso or French press."
2,Has it's moments,"The first time we used this grinder we were not impressed. Then we realized that to tighten the grinding apparatus you must turn it counter-clockwise. O.K. we now have that problem solved, but there are other problems with this grinder. First of all, the coarsest level is still pretty fine. I would have preferred a grind not as fine. This is not a problem for some people, just my personal preference. The biggest problem is that the darn thing quits grinding for some reason. I don't know if it's jammed or it gets too hot, but it just stops. Then I have shake it, or change the coarseness of the grind or just wait until it cools down. It becomes very frustrating especially when you're in a hurry. On the plus side, every ground is a uniform size. There are no large chunks of coffee mixed in with dust. Personally, I'm disappointed that I used a large chunk of a gift certificate on this item. It's definitely not worth more than about $20."
2,What A Mess,"I am in the process of returning this coffee grinder. It does what it's supposed to do(i.e. grind coffee) just fine, but it is impossible to get the final product (i.e. ground coffee) from the grinder to your coffee pot without leaving a wide dispersion of ground coffee all over your counter top. Very poor design in this respect."
2,"GRRRRR! Problematic ""burr""","I've been using it for a year now but I'm going to take it back and get a different grinder. The beans in this unit do not feed down and the motor screetches looking for beans when they are right there in the hopper, so I have to shake the grinder so beans will drop. Sigh. The other thing is, it stays warm, 24/7. Although a minor issue, just think about the electricity it wastes. I hate taking things back, but I'm going to do just that."
1,Never worked,This thing never worked to begin with. I checked all the parts to make sure everything was in tight multiple times to no avail. I'll be taking this back for a refund.
1,Saddly Disappointed,"It didn't work. I bought this model as a Christmas present for my husband, opened it up went to use it for breakfast... no go. No power. Tried everything. Thought we were doing something wrong, nope, just no power to it,dead. If we're doing something wrong then we don't want it because it must take a rocket scientist to operate. Back to Kaufmanns we go to return it.So saddly disapointed."
1,Broke after one use.,"I purchased this despite the negative reviews. I thought others were just being persnickety or were overfilling the beans or something. I was wrong, this item broke after only 1 successful use. It needs a redesign. On the up side, the pot I brewed with the one successful grind was delicious."
2,Poor Quality,"After having good luck with other Krups products, and bad luck with a similar Black and Decker product. I thought by spending more I would get more. Hard to believe how wrong that logic can be. Don't waste your money on this grinder."
1,It's cheap and you don't get what you pay for.,"Stay AWAY from this little thing- I would give it barely one star.It was nice for the first month or two then it just got clogged. I am handy with mechanics so I was able to disassemble and reassemble the thing, but then a month later the same problem again. We finally threw it away and went back to 10 year old our old blade grinder instead which works about 20X better. Big Disappointment from a Krups product and a big waste of money."
3,Almost there,I purchased this because the price was good for a burr grinder. There are a few annoying things with this. 1) You have to stand at the machine while it is running. The beans frequently fail to feed to the grinding mechanism and you need to shake it to get them to drop or you end up with less coffee than you set the dial to. 2) The plastic cup is full of static and the grinds stick to the sides. 3) You can only grind beans at the coarse settings or it really fails to grind the beans. I expected more from Krups.
3,Not sure yet...,This grinder is a replacement for a Cuisinart grinder that went bad after about 2 years. We didn't want to spend $150 for the Capresso or the Kitchen Aid so bought the Krups. Krups used to be known for their quality but everything on this unit is plastic and I'm not sure it's going to hold up. Beans get stuck while grinding and the only way to stop the noise is to try and jar the bean free by gently tapping the entire unit on the counter. It also doesn't seem to consistently grind the same amount of beans when set on the same number each time. It's a nice looking unit and very quiet compared to the Cuisinart. Time will tell...
2,Major upkeep,"I've been quite disappointed by the performance of this grinder. I've had one since christmas. (6 months) I've experience the problems with beans entering the burrs and it gets clogged often. My wife has difficulty cleaning it out when its clogged and I often find i have to shake it or remove the beans and add them back to get the burrs to find them again.I can't recommend this product, but after reading reviews of other burr grinders it seems to be a common problem."
2,Short life,"I will echo what has already been. Unfortunately the echo is on the negative side.I was gifted this grinder about two years ago and used it about 10 times, then packed it away. I took it out around 5 months ago to use it and it didn't work anymore. It worked fine when I packed it, I still have no idea why it didn't work later. After reading these reviews I see why there might be a problem."
1,Beware! It won't fine grind for espresso.,"I got this because I wanted to have freshly ground coffee for my little Italian stove-top Espresso maker. Good espresso requires a finely ground almost dust-like powdery consistency. The Krups burr grinder doesn't do the job even when I run the coffee through twice. I am sure it's fine for auto drip coffeemakers but as several other reviewers noted it sticks and/or gets blocked up on a regular basis too. I realize it's cheaper than other burr grinders but I have found that sometimes you can get something that does what it's supposed to at a reasonable price. It's an electrical motor with a grinder attached in a housing with two separate compartments for before and after, not exactly complex. That shouldn't be a $100 item in today's market. I have had this for a about a month. I wish I had taken it back the first week when I still had the receipt."
2,Depends on how fine you want your grounds,"Qualifying Statement - I only used it once.If you goal is espresso grounds, then it's a perfect grinder for you. If your goal is anything other than espresso grounds, this is not the grinder for you.At the coarsest setting, the grinder did not make grounds appropriate for drip machines. I did use them for that, but they were really too small, even bordering on grounds that are slightly larger than what should go in an espresso machine.We like to make a variety of coffee grounds, but this machine can not produce grounds big enough for drip machines and certainly not big enough for the french press. Espresso grind was fine.Everything else about the grinder was desireable. What a shame they didn't product test it before selling to consumers. With a small engineering adjustment to the width of grind space between the burrs, this could have been a great grinder. As it stands now, I sent it back for a refund."
4,"Krups GVX2-12 Burr Grinder, PARENT, Black and Metal",We are very pleased with our Krups grinder. Coffee tastes so much better from freshly ground coffee beans. My one criticism is that there seems to be an indiscernible difference in the results of grinding at the coarsest and finest settings.
1,Flawed design,"This could have been a nice little grinder but it suffers from serious mood disorders. The power switch is inoperative for no reason that I can see. Cleaned everything and ensured no coffee beans were in the way of the safety switch, yet no grindy :(One shouldn't have to pay $1000 to get a well engineered coffee grinder. Krupps would do well to redesign the fragile power and safety switch for their own good."
3,Average product,"This grinder does your job. The machine looks good but the parts feel cheap to use. It can be a little noisy especially for those who are sensitive. On the whole, it's not exactly your money's worth but if you have no other options and just need a machine to get the job done no matter what, go for this product."
2,several problems with this grinder,"I've been using this grinder for about a year, and it's finally broken and I'll replace it. The power button gave out, is broken inside the housing. Although it was serviceable enough, I wouldn't recommend it:- coffee grinds too finely at even the coarsest setting- coffee beans jam constantly, need to be shaken loose- powder enters the bin at the rear instead of top, falls down and makes a mess- dial indicator for quantity to grind is not at all helpful (especially since the coffee is jammed so frequently)"
1,Bad Design,"The ground coffee made by this machine makes a great brew.The ground coffee clings to the plastic container and it is very difficult to empty without making a mess. The container is relatively deep and narrow making it difficult to use measuring scoops. When the container is removed from the machine, coffee grounds spill from the machine onto the counter.Frequently beans do not feed the burrs, so constant attention is required.The on/off switch works about 50% of the time.Based on my experience, the machine is badly designed and cheaply made."
1,Krups GVX1 Burr Grinder,"The grinder grinds OK, but I have had a problem with the on/off button. It doesn't work all the time right away (about 20% of the time). A few times I put the drawer back in and it started to grind by itself. I think the problem has to do with cutoff switch actuated by the drawer. However, just just taking out the drawer and re-inserting it doesn't always get the on/off to work. At some, it just decides to start working again.On the plus side, it is compact, the settings are easy to follow, and the design is attractive. All that doesn't help when it won't work."
1,The machine turns out very consistent sludge,"If you are intending to grind coffee for french press, do not buy this machine! Amazon claims ""the machine turns out very consistent grounds."" As mentioned by many reviewers, it actually turns out a layer of coarse grinds, followed by an inescapable layer of super-fine grinds that turn into sludge in your cup. If you attempt to clean the machine, you will face an explosion of the static-charged layer of super-fine grinds. It's a wonder that a product meant to do one thing can fail to do that one thing."
2,"Gets your floors, counter, and hands dirty.","It's noisy, takes long time to grind, can't taste the difference b/w this and blade grinder, and most annoying, can't empty the grinds into the coffee maker without getting all over. I don't understand the design, 2nd time using it (first bought it many years ago, and then got it as a present recently). Having to replace it again with the Krups blade grinder."
1,"20 Settings - 1 Result: Some fine powder, but not much","Too bad I can't give this baby Zero stars. It definately earned it.This grinder has two dials on it. One of may (or may not) do something. I can't tell.Variable Coarseness: This dial does nothing. From 'Fine' to 'Coarse' I get the same fine powder appropriate for my Espresso machine, but my drip coffee maker and my French Press are out of luck.As for the ""Number of Cups"" dial, I don't know if this does anything. Long before it grinds enough powder, beans stop falling into the grind chamber. I don't know why. Violently shaking the grinder does some good, but not always. All I know is that the motor whirs until it overheats and stops, but the beans just sit in the hamper without being ground.This grinder is useless in multiple ways."
3,"Super-Fine, Super-Finicky","As others have said, you need to follow directions to the letter with this product. I don't find that too tedious, but it does make the machine very finicky. I do have to shake it at least once during grinding even 4 cups of beans so the beans will fall down and grind appropriately.What bothers me the most, and what has my husband singing praises, is the super-fine grind. The beans are reduced to a fine powder, literally. Even at the coursest setting, the grind is far too fine for any other use besides espresso, and even then, you will get an awful bitter taste from the freshest, sweetest beans if you use any other setting but the coursest. We use super-fresh beans from Coffee Fool, who packages and ships their beans straight off the line. Even the best coffee will taste bitter with too fine a grind.My husband loves it, because along with the fine grind comes increased caffeine content, but personally I'd prefer the moderate caffeine levels with superior taste."
2,Grinder settings... One size for all!,Well.. It worked fine for about 3 months. Now it doesn't adjust nor grind correctly. Dial for altering the grind no longer moves smoothly.. And when approaching '2' or '3' for a fine ground it just does a loud click then moves freely.I have followed the instructions multiple times to resolve -- Time to see how good their support folks are.
2,Same issues as others,"As many have mentioned, mine malfunctions almost every time I use the machine (probably 5 out of 7 days). It gets stuck, whirring without grinding, sometimes it won't shut off until I unplug it, and other times it doesn't grind the correct amount (will grind enough for two cups, then shut off, when the knob was set on 8).The counter-top mess is annoying. There is a lid that has to be removed before dumping the grinds, and coffee just goes everywhere.The only real plus is the presentation. I get a lot of compliments on this grinder, as in ""ooh, you have a Krups."" Little do they know, I guess.Honestly, the $15 Mr. Coffee grinder I got in college works at least twice as well."
1,Very short life span,"I have owned the Krups GVX2 burr grinder for about six months, grinding about three ounces of coffee beans per day. I agree with other reviewers that it is noisy, but I expect that from a coffee grinder. I agree that the self-feeding mechanism is poor, and I have to keep gently shaking the grinder to get the beans to feed through. The receptacle for the ground coffee is a bit hard to get in and out, and usually results in some spilt grounds when it suddenly pulls out. However, I considered all these as minor inconveniences, because it does make a very fine grind and gave all the appearances of lasting forever. Yesterday I would have given it 4 stars.Today, the light comes on, but the grinder doesn't work at all. I am mechanically minded, but see no obvious fix.$60 for a six month life is not a worthwhile investment."
4,Krups Burr Grinder a good buy,"We researched many different burr grinders in the process of replacing a Melita (MEBG8B)one we had for about a year. When that one stopped grinding to our satisfaction, we searched and found the Krups GVX1-14. In addition to great styling, its one of the quieter grinders we've seen. Its easy to use, holds a good quantity of beans (ground and unground) and the adjustments for both courseness of grind, and volume (time) are easy to make. We've been using for over a month, and find this burr grinder to be a good buy."
1,"Poorly designed, messy machine!","Smart design? I disagree. This model is poorly designed and I would not recommend any coffee grinder that has a removable ground cartridge. Every time I remove the cartridge, grounds spill every where, no matter how careful I am. A trace of grounds is left behind everytime I place the cartridge back into place... which means every morning I am wiping grounds from the counter. This machine is messy and drives me crazy! I suggest buying a model that has a simple one-piece design."
5,This is a fantastic book,"Professor Hall's book gives a concise but thorough exposition of the theology of the cross (a theology, I confess, that I find utterly convincing and inspiring). The book also does a nice job of relating the theology of the cross to contemporary social issues and to the decline of mainline denominations (in the face of, among other things, the triumphalism of some evangelicals). I would recommend this book to anyone (especially clergy) who would like an introduction to the theology of the cross and the political theology that comes out of it."
3,75% Brilliant Insight -25% Confusion,"I have been really moved by this book. I have been challenged to entirely alter my engagement with the world around me. Hall's insights are clearly encouraging to anyone wanting to engage with society around them. The last 25% Hall goes off the rails. He questions the sayings of Christ, the authority of the Bible, and Gods final revelation of him self through his Son. A universalist in every way.Tim"
4,Best book ever for read alouds!,"I've read this story to elementary age children for years. First graders to fifth graders,they are captured from the very first word and sit spell bound till the last. I guess the secret is that I love reading it as muchas they love listening."
5,My kid asks me to read this to him all year round,"My child has had this book since he was 4, and it is one of his favorites. It's a little bit scary (from a kid's perspective) and I think that's one of the reasons he likes it so much. It's exciting for him. I like the fact that Hershel uses his brain and trickery to rid the town of goblins, rather than violence. This book inspired me to check out others by Eric Kimmel and he's since become one of our favorite children's book authors."
5,5 Star Wing Chun book,This is by far the best book I have seen on Wing Chun and it teaches you what you must know to master the art. Authored by J. Yimm Lee and the technical editor was Bruce Lee; Bruce Lee was J. Yimm Lee's teacher. This is a book on the combat art not the sport.
4,"Phil's fans will like this album, & R&B lovers will adore it","This is a great 'varios artist' album. If you were waiting for a 'more than one singer' album, you will like this one, cuz you'll have in every song the creative magic of Phil Collins. If you are a fan of him, you'll like too. I know there are a little bit of rap versions, difficult to like by pop likers, that there are songs like the one sung by Deborah Cox, 'Something Happened On The Way To Heaven'. Love that song and love that gurl. What a voice, and what and slow version!!! It's my favorite!!!"
4,Interesting and well researched,"This is a well done book with tons of photos and lots of literature and obscure facts on Warren Telechron. The only thing I found a little dissapointing was the clocks themselves. A few are fabulous, scarce and expensive but the majority are rather conservative and dull. Still, an excellent piece of research."
3,"good for a start, but...","This is a good book to get the juices flowing if you are unsure of how to model certain business processes, but some of the models in the book are poor examples of database design. Some of the data warehouse models, in particular, are alarmingly bad, and don't follow some proven best practices.I think the beginner database designer will get a lot out of it -- seeing the complexities in database design. The expert will get a little from it -- a good kick-start on a design, but you will be able to see the faults. Someone with a little knowledge that relies on this book too much, however, will be sorry."
5,FUNKTASTIC!,"Funktafied is the MASSIVE comeback single from the UK's premier soul band FIVE STAR! With mellow, soft and sensual vocals from ultra fit Denise Pearson and her siblings, this song is sexy, laid back and completely ""Funktafied"" deserves the success it is achieving, and so much more! Go buy it!..."
1,disappointing.,"Like the other reviews. I agree with what they say about this item. Try another, my next halloween costume will be something different."
3,Good but not perfect,"I ordered the standard size, which is fine. The only complaint I have is that the arms are a little tight. I am size 10 and the arms are snug. Also, the straps do not go all of the way around the back. So, visually, it looks a little strange from the back. But, for less than $30, I am not going to complain."
1,Terrible Smell,I received this item and it smelled like weed. I opened it and it made my whole apartment smell like weed. I was volunteering at a childrens carnival and had to hurry and find a costume because this one was unsatisfactory. And the company is saying they wont let me refund it because the smell is my fault. Terrible buy. Will NEVER purchase from Rubies Costume Co AGAIN!
4,TINA MAY - JAZZ ARTISTE,"I've seen Tina May several times on the jazz circuit in London. I love paritcularly the jazzy ""They can't take that away from me"" and of course the famous ""Les Fueilles Mortes"". For those of you who cannot hear a soundbite, She has a lovely bell like quality to her voice and generally has a smooth laid back effortless style. There are plently of instrumental breaks for those that like 'em - I don't - which is why I've not given 5 stars.Singingweasel"
2,U3 Stinks!,"Watch out for this U3 crap. The reality is that as far as I'm concerned, it's useless at best. Worse yet, it interferes with the operation of the flash drives. In concept the U3 software sounds interesting. Who wouldn't like to be able to run software from a flash drive on a computer? The reality doesn't match the concept: you get a limited selection of oddball software that is pretty much useless for most people. Then you get two drives installing on any computer on which you use the flash drive. You can't even erase the U3 crap off the flash drive since it's read-only. PNY has really screwed up on this one. Their hardware may be among the best, but the U3 crap is the pits."
4,This is a great Crockpot!,This is a perfect size for things like oatmeal for 1-2 people. I use it every night. I do wish it had a timer but I have set up a timer to the outlet so it doesn't over cook & my oatmeal is ready in the morning!
3,small,"I received this little crockpot and to be honest - about the only thing I can see making in this small container is maybe dip?? Seriously can't think of anything that would fit..I bought it to cook for 2, but as of right now it's been on the counter and never used once.. Will probably land up donating it. If it's 1 1/2 quarts they must be measuring from handle to handle.. because seriously it's like 1 1/2 cups."
5,Good little cooker,This is a good little cooker. I bought it to cook steel cut oats in. I'm sure you can cook small amounts of polenta and rice too! The cooker has a nice clean neat look about also.
2,Not the best tasting,The hot sauce was bitter and it really didnt compliment any food I tried with it. Don't buy this unless you want your food tasting like vinegar
2,Just not the same any more,If you just started watch scrubs you may like the most resent seasons. People that have been watching since it started may find that season five is a continuation of the downhill slide that started in season four. The show is no longer amusing stories about things that happen to doctors in medicen. It instead has become a soap opera about just the characters lives. So everyone so to add drama almost everyone is pregnant or having children.In addition the humor is no longer the creative unpredictable. It more like and 80s sitcom where you see every joke coming.
3,Not bad but not her best,"I'm not sure what it was about this story that left me feeling... blase... about it. It wasn't a bad story, but it didn't quite pack the punch her stuff usually does."
4,Life with a Purpose,"The Apostle: The Life of Paul was very informative and in my humble opinion remained factually true to all that is currently know of Paul, his conversion, his mission, and most importantly his passion for sharing Christ with a world that had little time or use for the information. Paul could have easily given up on many occasions but as this book shows us he remained true to love of Christ and accepted all persecution for his faith. I would recommend this book to anyone wishing to learn more about this man and his mission to carry Christ's message to the gentiles."
3,A fair but worth it,"Not the best book I have ever read, but gave me a very good understanding about St. Paul. I had visited several of the countries that Paul was in, so that help me relate to his life more fully. He was quite a man and deserves to be a Saint."
3,Works okay,"It can sharpen your chains but it will not (at least with me using it) get near as good and as consistent as a factory new blade. You gotta have a sharpener, and it is not a lot of money but I was a little disappointed at the result. Keep in mind that it DOES sharpen the blade - just not as good as new."
5,Excellent Product,"Very strong. Easily holds my 50"" plasma. Mounts the wall with ease. Great variety of mounting features. Fits as close to the wall as possible and still allows room to connect components."
4,Great book for teens!!!,Reva Dalby is back to her mean self and is going to get what she deserves. I liked this book because it reminded me of real life as a teenager and how kids are desperate for money. It was hard to put the book down because it always left you hanging after each chapter. It was funny to read what Reva was doing to people and how sly she was with getting out of trouble. I would recommend this for tenagers who like thrill and suspence.
4,"excellent read, should have been included with HOL","I've read House of Leaves twice, and neither time I felt like I was able to get through Pelafina's letters. However, it was much easier to read all of them in The Whalestoe Letters. Perhaps because they are all included in proper sequence? The introduction is nice as well."
3,Instead of II-E,"Rather than reading Appendix II-E of House of Leaves and then reading Whalestoe Letters, you might as well read the latter instead of the former.The major difference is that, where II-E shows a fairly linear descent from sanity to insanity, WL provides a more complex story, showing that Pelafina had earlier episodes of madness than II-E lets on.In and of itself, WL doesn't really do much, but it does flush out the story of House of Leaves a bit."
2,Didn't work for my Golden Retriever puppy,I returned this. My pup was not the least bit interested in this toy. My Golden Retriever puppy was 12 weeks and 20 lbs when i purchased this...if i had gotten a larger one he MAY have liked it.
4,Origami Paper,My grandson loves to do Origami and likes all different colors and sizes. It was easy to get through amazon.
4,Worth a Look.,"I read another review of this item, which said something like ""et tu, Ilse,"" and was expecting something less than what I actually found. I have read most of Reich's writings. As well as the correspondence with A. S. Neill. I have enormous respect for Reich, and his work. But the continual lifetime persecutions all over Europe and the U.S. eventually took its toll on the man. The author's exposition feels very detail oriented and in line with my other readings. This is a very readable and interesting biography of a Pioneer by someone who was as close to him as they come. She is clearly articulate and intelligent; her respect for his work comes through. And for some of his work, she could not follow, says so and leaves it for others to judge.This probably is not the first place you are going to go to learn about Reich, but if like me, you have become facinated with this brillant and unstoppable groundbreaker, this volume is not to be missed."
1,Ugh,"Impossible to finish this book. The real question how andwhy do we stay connected to the women in our lives? This is a bitter, nasty book by someone who should have known better.Obviously hurt by Reich's dynamic personality she complainsin a tortured voice; how pitifull. Et Tu Ilsa. Really its late.So browze this book to see what Reich had to put up with.To get a true picture of Reich you have to be dammed lucky tofind a therapist who went through Reich's therapy. All his great books are a road map to his therapy."
3,First album in EWFs 80s musical decline.,"This album starts to abandon the original idea, sound and concept of EWF. The fussion of jazz, soul, and world music was being replaced by that trendy 80s ultra produced synthy sheen that plagued pop for so many years. Still the album can be saved, EWF's spirit was burried under a popish-last day disco sound but it was still there. ""Let's Groove"" is a timeless classic and there are a coulpe of good gems. But from this moment on EWF would never be the same. Things would deteriorate further more...."
4,Vintage EWF,"While not as sustainably enjoyable as earlier offerings, Raise nevertheless hardly disappoints. The only two songs on the LP that didn't tickle my fancy were ""Evolution Orange"" and ""Changing Times."" Certainly, the big commercial hit ""Let's Groove"" still maintains its, well, groove! Meanwhile, ""Lady Sun"" and ""You Are a Winner"" hasten the musical pace, while ""My Love"" and ""Wanna Be With You"" slow it down a bit, built on succulent harmonious melodies."
2,America's Army,This game isn't quite up to par as much of the other. COD4 or GRAW2 Frankly I found it a waste of money. Single player game play is slow a bit to drawn out. Game is definitely designed for multiplayer. If your choices are Call of Duty 4 or America's Army. Call of Duty 4 is the way to go.
4,Tough Game,"Tough game. Don't expect to go for broke straight out of the box. To get to the meat of the game you really have to develop your Soldier on the ranges and in training missions. If you want auto-aiming and the ability to save your game just before the going gets tough, then COD4, Ghost Recon and such games are for you. If you want your training and fitness level to affect your ability to aim and the challenge of not being able to save your place in combat, then give this one a go."
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY,"This game totally sucks.I thought it might play like any Call of Duty game,but only gives you training missions.It freezes constantly and the AI people shooting at you can hit you even if you are hiding behind cover.People will have their mouths moving even though they aren't even talking.Like I said,don't waste your money."
4,Good CD,My son who is 2.5 yrs old and he loves the CD! He also likes to read the book. Recommended!!
3,Another Dylan Sabotage from the 80s,"He wrote some great, great songs in the 80s, he really did. The problem is, for the most part, he chose not to release them. Where's ""Caribbean Wind,"" ""Angelina,"" ""You Changed My Life"" and ""Magic""?I give the album three stars for the title track, ""Groom Still Waiting at the Altar"" and ""Every Grain of Sand,"" the last being one of the best songs in his very voluminous catalogue."
3,"Not too bad an album, but not great either","This album probably isn't as bad as people want you to believe. Dylan still writes most of the songs about his refound believe in Jesus, which is pretty interesting a theme. ""The groom's still waiting at the Altar"" is the only song of the album that is well-known, yet that's the song I like least. ""Property of Jesus"" is a strong and powerful song. I can't understand why most people hate the title song either, it's a pretty good song with interesting lyrics. O.K, this album isn't a killer and will never make my top 10 of Dylan albums, but it isn't as bad as they want it to be."
2,Has very little worth having,"Taking a look at the tracklisting, here is a rundown of each track:1. Tell Mama--You can get it on 18 Essential Songs or Janis 3-CD digitally remastered 2. Magic of Love--This song has never been a favorite and is not a very good version here. 3. Misery'n--Would be great, but 80s instruments are added. 4. One Night Stand--Brilliant track, only available here. 5. Harry--Meaningless, but interesting. Only available here. 6. Raise Your Hand--Another great track and the only one from Kozmic Blues Band 7. Farewell Song--This can be found on Live At Winterland '68 digitally remastered. 8. Amazing Grace/Hi-Heel Sneakers--Would have been great if the whole songs were used, instead they are edited down to less than 3 minutes! But worth having. 9. Catch Me Daddy--80s instrumentals ruin this song that is only available here!So, decide for yourself. Personally, I think this should be the last Janis CD you should own!"
5,excellent,"There hasn't been a better book since Naria! talking animals, enchanted forests, a beautiful young gopi, and the evil king Nahusha make for a truly captivating story filled with adventure and morels."
4,"Good, but not his best","The Iron Ring is a little stranger than most of his books, and not as engaging. That is not to say it is not engaging (because it is) but I sneaked flashlights under my covers to read Prydain. This ia not quite so absorbing. It is very interesting, though. a real look into Indian culture and honor."
4,Good chairs,"I ordered four of these chairs to go with matching card table. They are the same quality Samsonite chairs I've had in the past. They color and fabric is quite attractive. One thing I don't like is that a card stock label is attached under the seat; in order to get rid of the label completely, you would have to actually remove the cushion from the seat. As it is, the edge of the card stock peeps out between the cushion and the metal seat edge. Probably nobody will notice but me, but it BUGS me. Funny, I just realized I wrote more about the negative things, but it is a very nice folding chair. I would recommend it."
2,Barbie Styling Head is not recommended,"My daughter got this when she was 4, and unfortunately she didn't really seem to want to pretend to be a hair dresser with it, so it was donated after 6 months."
2,Softest file I've ever used,"The file guide works great, and the handle is usable though cheap, but the file itself is junk. My initial indication that something was wrong came the first day when the file bent. Hardened files should not bend, ever. They should break first. By the time I had used up my first chain, the file teeth were completely gone. This file set is fine if you need a guide and plan on replacing the file, or if you rarely ever use it, but if you intend to actually sharpen your saw from time to time, you'll use more time trying to get the file to cut than you will spend actually cutting wood.It gets 2 stars because it is a decent price for the guide and handle."
1,Don't even consider Riley,I did not enjoy this book at all. I felt it was an insult to women everywhere. I did not feel anything for Riley and Jayne and the silly way the heroine was portrayed was insulting.
3,playtime wont last long,"Like I wrote in my title, playtime wont last long! My daughter still cant really use the squeeze toy and shes much older than when she first got these toys which were her first! The other toys didnt really keep her interest at all. I used these toys when she was really really young just to get her eyes to follow objects. After that these toys basically stayed at the bottom of the toy box."
1,The Deafening Sound Of Mediocrity,"The Sounds Of Sylence by Sylence Campbell is a mediocre collection of self indulgent writing that trys so hard to portray the typical ""dark, tortured, yet resurrected poet."" The author should get high grades for trying, but the result is an abysmal failure. Right from the start one must cringe at the title of this work, which would be a clever play on words referencing the popular Paul Simon song, ""The Sounds of Silence,"" except for the misspelled last word, the authors name. Poetry should make the reader think about the subject being addressed. The author fails on this point. A book of good poetry should pull the reader along, from page to page. I kept thinking 'how many more pages until this book is done,' as I hopefully searched for one decent poem (I had given up hope of finding just one good one). There are plenty of good poetry books out there. One would probably do better by picking any other poetry book at random than by buying The Sounds Of Sylence."
4,NIV Harmony of the Gospels,I enjoyed this book and find it full of information that is useful. It is a good reference to use along with your bible.
1,Indiana,"They were much longer than I thought from the discription. I was looking for individual ones that would fit on dinner plates, like the ones they use at Red Lobster. They are also spaced to far apart for placing food on them without splitting. I had to rebend them. Okay for BBQing but not to serve on."
4,Better Than I Remember,"Chances are you've already heard the songs on this CD. I was in high school when Loverboy hit the big time. To be honest, I really didn't care for them at the time. Me and my friends always made fun of how they looked in their videos. Now, at 40, I was browsing through songs of my youth and found Loverboy. I was surprised by how much more complex they were than other pop bands of the day. As a band, they are tight. Mike Reno's vocals are as good as anyone in this genre. I'm still not a big of ""Working for the Weekend"" (never warmed up to this one) but ""Lucky Ones"" and especially ""When it's Over"" are are the gems here. I don't know what's in the water in Canada, but they seem to turn out more than their fair share of solid musical acts."
5,It rocks!,"I'll never understand it , but most young kids today won't like this album/cd.But I think one day it might get hot again.I was in the 11th grade when it came out and I loved it.The Loverboy and Dokkin concert was one of my favorites.I got to go buy it right now ! I had it but I lost it !"
1,gross,"This book was full of violence and sex. I don't normally mind, but the ""heroin"" of the story wasn't very heroic. If this darkness led to a path of redemption then It would not bother me. They were enslaveing kids, they drownded a horse in a bar, nobody was nobel enough to care! Not one charecter stood up and said enough is enough. Nobody decided to fight or say no. It was as if this was ok. It would be if there was fighting and a plan to over throw the system."
4,Enjoyable Read,"This is an interesting read telling the story from the viewpoints of several troopers who participated. It covers the ""big picture"" only to the extent needed."
5,Historically important and great narrative,"I recently became enthralled with the Napoleonic wars (even stranger as an American), with a combination of the Sharpes Rifles book and television series that I now own, and the Game Napoleon Total War. This book is written as a third person omniscent narrative of the 95th Rifles from their departure from England to the Iberian campaign. The book is well written, as even though it follows a narrative rather then strictly historical, its all based off of letters, reports and previous histroy books on the subject. It gives great insight IMO was the British Elite light infantry (well The Connaught Rangers and Kings German legion were pretty skilled as well) but shows the politics of war, especially in a European army at that time, where the concept of a Gentleman first, officer (and combat leader) second butted heads with the needs for victory and repsect for the common elisted man."
2,Basic English Grammar,"When I ordered this book, the condition was rated as ""Used, Like new."" I expected it to have some normal wear and tear. However, when I got it, I discovered that many of the grammar exercises (and there are many) had already been completed and others had been partially erased. Unfortunately, it is not very useful for me unless I go back and erase all of the completed exercises...a tedious task as so many have been done."
4,Comfortable!,"I bought these short for workouts and for hot summer days when I just want to lay around all day. I was surprised by how comfortable the fabric was, and how breathable it is. Yes, they do ride up occasionaly, but I wouldn't expect anything else from workout shorts. Be careful to order the correct size for you - a size larger and I could see them slipping right off, and a size smaller would be trying to fit an elephant into a toothpaste bottle. Overall, I'm very satisfied with my purchase."
3,OKAY,Looks great and very comfortable until it starts to ride up. Once I got into a pretty intense workout session I find myself constantly having to pull the legs down. The ride factor was too high for me.
5,A MUST for collectors and players alike,"If you collect Comic Books you have to have an OverStreet's Guide, well, if you collect videogames you owe it to yourself to own the Digital Press Collector's Guide. Until now there's been no REAL source of what all of these games were worth, what was rare and what was just plain junk. Self proclaimed ""Pros"" would charge whatever they felt for an old game saying it was ""super rare and valuable"" and who would know better. Well now you have the power of information at your hands to be sure that you're getting your money's worth. This is definately the book to have in the car when your off to the flea market for the day :)And for non-collectors, its still a blast to read and more than worth picking up for all of the memories contained inside. There really isnt a more complete guide available for classic videogames. If you played it in your youth then the odds are that its in here."
2,More of the same?,"I ordered this book for my son who is an avid game collector and spends his entire allowance on games and gaming books like this one. He has the previous two editions and was disappointed that this ""new"" book is very similar to the old ones. I read through the book and found it boring, but I am not a person who finds this sort of thing interesting anyway so what do I know. I did not think the book looked very professional and my son says it has some incorrect information but I could see it being a good guide for people new to the hobby."
5,Best Mexican Rock Band,"It was last year when a friend of mine told me went to a Zurdok show in LA. I bought the album ""Hombre Sintetizador"" without ever hearing it.I just loved it. I had the chance to get ""Maquillaje"" in Mexico City as soon as it hit the stores.All songs have an spiritual content that's very dificult to get in contemporary rock music. ""De afuera hacia adentro"" is one of their best lyrics, only competing with ""Asi Es"". If you like british and experimental rock music you'll like ""Zurdok - Maquillaje"". If spanish is not your languaje, the music will take you out anyhow.One of the best albums I've gotten this year, besides RadioHead and SantaSabina."
2,Fast but died quickly,"I purchased 2 of these drives for my ATA 133 array. They were speedy, I will grant Maxtor that, but crashed several times resulting in data lost, system rebuilds and so on. Anyway after the 2nd crash I got smart and moved my important files over to an old Western Digital drive I've had for almost 4 years now. Good thing too because not long after one of the two disks in the array (stripped not mirrored) completely died with no chance at recovery (would not even register with Maxtor's disk utilities). Thank god all a lost were some unimportant mp3s and the such. Anyway, you would expect more than 10 months on a Home PC disk drive. ATA 133 is nice, but reliabilty outwieghs the (small) bump in speed anytime."
1,Lasted just a few hours,"I got a brand new one of these the other day. I was pleased with how quiet and how fast it was. I was just about done transferring my system to this drive, when it came to a grinding halt. It made a series of awful scraping noises, and now the system can't even detect that it's there. What a crock."
2,Bellamy Bros,"This is another example of buying a DVD because I liked a good song and was expecting the album to be as good as the one song I liked, it was not"
1,don't buy it! save your trip!,"my husband and i returned from paris two days ago. i've been to paris eleven times and love to research before i go. this year, i chose this frommer's guide as my guide.. and then we went to paris. in the first day alone, we found five inaccuracies. phone numbers are wrong. museums listed as open are closed. our hotel.. listed as a ""find"" was terrible. we stayed one night and then sought out another hotel (cheaper, by the way) where we'd stayed before. buy a different book.. not this one. it's just plain wrong. i'd recommend the rick steves series. this frommer's guide cost us time and money."
2,Not What I Expected,The focus of the book was not what I had anticipated... had to return because the information given was irrelevant to my research.
1,Junk!,This is not what I expected it is made of cheap plastic. The thermometer is 7 degrees off. I would not even pay a $1 for it. Not recommended.
3,Not entirely magical,"This is a worthy addition to the Tim Hunter chronicles, with fine art & some nice lines (Constantine: ""Sometimes I wonder if [being a magician] is really worth it... the rest of the time I just know it's not."").Iolanthe, half-human half-faerie, is the most engaging new character (new to me anyway). The Walker & Nick Bearclaw are appealing if somewhat cliched, but the bad guy, Lily, initially scary, fails to convince. He's a poor imitation of Preacher's Starr (with a similar power of vocal command to Jesse Custer's) & his girl-pop obsession is just cringeworthy.It's ultimately moving & really adds something to the overall mythos, but the ending feels very rushed - story & characters could have done with more space to breathe."
1,I should have read the other reviews,"These hex wrenches are poorly made. The first one that I used stripped.I had to go to Home Depot and get T handle set that worked perfectly.It's my believe that the difference is in the quality of metal. If you had an easy project that did not require a lot of torque, perhaps these would be fine but for anything more I would get a better set."
4,"Long handle wrench set, metric ""T"" handle","I only have a need for these on occasion. They work fine. I repair eqipment on the road so I have to have the metric sizes available. Regards, Ron Koch"
1,Cheap Junck,These may have a good price but anyone considering this product should just spend a little more money and buy a better T-Handle set.Most of the T-Handles out of this pack I have used and they have rounded off on the ends and the only way to keep using them is to cut the ends off then the same thing happens again. These are cheap made and will not last.
3,"Naif, of course","Of course it is naif in the eyes of the 2008 viewer, but let`s try to recover it`s idealism"
4,Gourmet Bookshelf Wall Mount Pot Rack,Christmas Gift for my niece was a huge hit. She has a small kitchen and need the space since she is having a baby and is inneed of space to put baby bottles and such. Now she can hang pots and use that space to store baby things. Great look too.Makes an attractive addition to her kitichen.
1,Barbara Streisand,It has a good selection of her poular songs and I enjoyed listening to it very much as did my husband.
5,Impeccable,"This album represents one of the greatest officially released live recordings in music history, on par with Frampton Comes Alive, Live Dead, and the Allman Brothers Live at the Fillmore East. Dylan and the band mesh superbly to produce a powerful, invigorating and yet delicate sound. Highlights include a scorching ""The Weight"", several tremendous solo Dylan tunes (especially ""It's All Right Ma""), and a rendition of ""Blowin in the Wind"" that reminds us why it's one of the most important songs ever written. A true gem of an album."
2,Out of date,Disappointing. Most of the useable material is covered in their abbreviated version. A lot has happened with Google's tools since this was published in 2006.
4,"""Google Hacks"" is highly technical","This book is an excellent reference for someone with special research needs. However, it is not for the average user as it requires above average technical knowledge. This should be pointed out more directly in the description."
5,Not Much to say,"i can not change any minds about this movie, but it is absolutly one of the best movies ever created"
1,WILL NOT PRCHASE ANOTHER ITEM FROM THIS COMPANY,I did not get to view this DVD it was not for my region. Had I known this when I bought it and they made it clear in viewing description I again would not have bought this item.The item description was not the same as it was when it purchased it. Totally dis-satisfiied. They will not give me a refund nor my shipping cost. I will NOT purchase another item or product from this company again. I will also tell any of from friends and family to be aware and be guarded to order from this company!!!
2,Apolcalyptp disc.,Enjoyed the movies and commentation but the disc stopped and paused at the 11th scene (sacrifice) and continued through the chase through the jungle. For what I paid it would not be advantageous for me to send it back. Last time it cost more than the item itself and out of $10. I received only $1.00 credit for it. I would however need another copy of this movie as it is very annoying watching it stop and pause like it does.
4,Magnificent!,I saw the last 45 min of this movie after fliping through cable channels. I thought it was amazing and can't wait to see the entire movie.
1,That's it?,"I was really disappointed with Apocalypto. I heard lots of good things from my friends and made the mistake of buying it without having seen it first. There is no story in this movie. It's moderately impressive visually, but Mel Gibson doesn't seem to understand that a lot of pretty pictures do not a movie make. It is more impressive that the main character (whatever his name is) is in virtually every shot, and yet still he is somehow not developed at all. The movie had me bored to tears and watching it I did nothing but ask myself for two and a half hours why it was ever filmed."
4,So close to 5 stars...,"I have this movie on Blu-ray disk. Played this on my playstation 3 through a Sharp HD tv. The picture and sound is incredible. There is no doubting that the technology is a huge leap forward.The film itself it very good...but...You buy this film because you want a visually stunning film that takes you to a different place for a couple of hours. This film does this...but in a couple of places you find yourself wondering if they over edited or simple forgot to shoot for an additional 10 or 20 seconds, that would have made this a masterpiece.The important bits:1 - This is not historically accurate - but it's not designed be.2 - I recommend this film to everybody who can recognise great sights and sounds.3 - I will be buying more Blu-ray disks based on my experience with this one."
3,Amazing art direction,"Fundamentally, it turns into a revenge film which keeps me from giving it 5 stars & Gibson is certainly a sadist who has a god/martyr complex but he deserves great credit for bring this ""history"" to the screen. And the fact it's in a native language is key - I hope hollywood starts making all period pieces in their native language - I hate hearing english in a film when it's ridiculous. I highly recommend Rapa Nui if you liked this film - it's actually a much better story but with ""english speaking characters. Please, Mel, remake Rapa in it's native tong with native actors!! It would be THE perfect cautionary tail."
1,I don't get all the hype,"The first scene they hunt this wild pig, kill it, then they cut the testacles off it and make one of the guys eat them in hopes that he will be able to get his wife pregnant. They actually showed him eating the balls...gross. I promptly removed it from the PS3, put it in the Netflix envelope and sent it back. It is beyond me why you'd open a movie like that."
1,One Star Is Too Many,"This movie portrays one gruesome act after another to the extent that it is boring. It drives home the theme of man's inhumanity to man over and over and over. If I could have given it 0 stars I would have.Also this movie is entirely subtitles.I'm not a Mel Gibson fan anymore but tried it because I have Netflix and the Starz movies, of which this is one, will be deleted from the selections after Feb. 28, 2012. I'm trying to watch as many, that are interesting, as possible prior to the cutoff. I watched about 20 minutes of it and decided to try another selection.If I had known how dull it was, I would not have bothered. I'm writing this review in hopes that I can save others from wasting their time."
3,"Original story, but boring to watch","This movie has plenty of quick and violent scenes, and the camera work and shots are excellent, but there is a ton of running, the character development is fair but flimsy, and overall this turns into a 2 hour film of a man running through the jungle. Very simple premise, simple to watch, worth viewing once. Not the worst movie of the year, but not the best."
2,Almost.....FAMOUS!,"One teensy scene upgrade: GODZILLA shows up onshore! It would have made for a much more believable film. Why not come out of the closet my dearest Mel and just make a horror flick, all the elements did present well. Why bother with the diversionary costly landscape, which was breathtaking and single redeeming feature. The same plot, flute theme, final showdown, blood, gore, hatred inducing scenes, over and over again. YAWN!!! JagPaw, JagWar, JigSaw, SeeSaw, BigKflaw...."
3,tribal head trip from a sacramental wino,Visually - this movie is very appealling. It is incredibly violent. Mel just loves to make movies with sets involving young child actors strewn around burning villages being prompted to cry over their sodomized and decapitated family members. I wonder where the envelope ends for him as a director. I guess its OK if you can show pre-Cortez Mayan Indians praying to St Mary or quoting passages from the Lord's Prayer.But hey... No animals were injured in the making of this film.
1,"Pointless, Jack Bower without the cell phone","While visually satisfying the appetite and creative in that sense, I kept waiting for a point to be made. Like ""24"" you have to suspend disbelief--a man is tortured, forced to walk for miles and miles through jungle and rapids and hills, no food, no water (no cell phone), shot with a spear through the abdomen, meets up with a panther and outruns him, shot with an arrow through the shoulder, jumps down a massive waterfall, survives all and still outruns several healthy, well equipped (but really lousy shots) and well fed pursuers. The ending was pat and predictable. Enough gore and bloodshed to satisfy even the most hungry mass murderer watching. I kept wondering, what kind of sick mind keeps making the same movie over and over--all Gibson's movies seem to have no other point that to kill and gore and behead and sever as many limbs as possible under the guise of pretending to tell a story."
5,entertainment at its best,"Enough of the details are accurate enough to make this a most wonderful excursion into the mists of the Pre Columbian past. Add to that superb photography and acting, a tour de force of production.Folks: It don't get any better!!!"
1,Don't know - don't care,"The one star rating is meaningless - I had to give the film some rating to submit the review.This film may be wonderful. I wouldn't know. I do my best not to buy or watch work from rabid racist anti-semites. I haven't seen Triumph of the Will or Olypiad. Most likely am missing some very important visual art. And I most likely have bought, used and seen all sorts of work by people who were/are racists.Just try my best not to support such people. There are enough film and other masterpieces out there that I will never have time to experience them all. I will never have the time - after all, starting all the wars - and he meant it - is a rather considerable undertaking."
1,ZERO STARS,"Do not waste one penny of your money or one minute of your life on this sickening, psychotic, repulsive piece of garbage! Spend your money on ANYTHING ELSE & you will be better off. Who, other than Mel Gibson, or the next Jeffrey Dahmer could watch this & find it entertaining?"
