5,Much better than OEM ear buds,"I bought these headphones for my daughter's iPod. Their sound does not seem to come from an external source, it's just there in one's head yet because of the open design, it's easy to hear what's going on in the world (traffic, voices, etc.) so one is not isolated and unaware of potential safety hazards. These headphones may be less than perfect for home listening but can't be beat for portable sound. And they fold for stuffing in a tote."
5,great,"best headphones for this price range. excellent clarity and loud bass. if an mp3 is of low quality, you'll hear its faults. but that reflects on the file itself, not the headphones. as good as some $200 models and miles above traditonal $15-$40 headphones."
5,Shame the price almost doubled,"These headphones are da bomb. The bass responce alone is amazing. I've bought 2 pair for myself alone (yes they both still crank), and as gifts for every ipod fanatic...ie....everyone, and they get only raves. Shame they're no longer the incredible bargain they used to be. They come with a hard case that takes some practice. Bought them all at various times for about $39 on Amazon."
3,"Very good sound, quality fair","This is my 2nd pair of Sennheisers. I am disappointed in the lack of quality. The sound is really excellent, I'm just not sure how long they'll last. The frame is cheap, the wires thin and the plug is flimsy."
1,I hope yours last longer than mine...,"One accidental tug on the wire caused the left channel to stop working. They describe these as ""rugged collapsible headphones,"" which is an absurd description for this delicate, flimsy product. There is nothing in the design of the wire connection to the mini stereo pin to enable it to survive a significant shock. However, tugging on the wire is inevitable because the wire is too short (4') for both of the locations where I had hoped to use them--with a digital piano and with a mini-tower computer that sits on the floor.The sound was fine when they worked."
3,sound amazing but won't last,"The sound on these Sennheisers are quite amazing. I was quite surprised at the level of clarity achieved with these pretty inexpensive earphones. I'm a stickler when it comes to good audio quality and I was amazed to hear things going on in the music I was listening to that I hadn't noticed before. With that said I was pretty disappointed with the durability. I had two of these headphones and they both wore away right above the earphone jack; Granted I would just throw them in my backpack which probably didn't help the wear and tear. They come with a headphone case, but really who really wants to take the time, collapse the headphones and put them away in a case with every use? not me! I would like to give this a 5 star review for sound alone but I'll knock it down to three for cheap construction."
2,Nice sound...not very durable,"As with most Sennheiser products, the sound on these inexpansive headphones is very good. But I would be reluctant to purchase again for a teenager for an upgrade on an MP3 player. The connection of the headpiece came aprt quite easily for an on the go teenager."
3,Nothing spectacular,I'm not someone who listens to music professionally but I was willing to pay a bit more to replace my headphones that cost half as much to get the great sound everyone was talking about.I am underwhelmed by these and really didn't notice any improvement. I know this is contrary to other reviews.I also find the cord is too short and don't like the fact that the jack is straight and not 90 or 45 degrees like on many other headphones. This causes it to bend more if it (and my MP3 player)is in a pocket or something. This can damage the MP3 player jack.The hard case and folding makes it nicer for traveling.
4,Best Bang for Your Buck!!,These have to be one of the best headphones I have ever purchased/used. Extremely light...yet produce magnificant sound...and also reasonably priced...and their Sennheiser's you can't go wrong. My only beef is that I wish they were noise cancelling...but i dont think the price would the same if they were...so make sure you give them a try.
3,"Nice sound, but...","I bought these headphones to use with my ipod, and while the sound was good I found the construction to be a below my expectations. The first week I had them the ear pad fell off and I was continually searcing for it in my bag, on my desk or around the house as a favorite cat toy. After about a year the structural integrity of the wires became stiff and brittle eventually leading to the wire snapping just above the connector.""It's OK,"" I thought, ""I'll just solder on a new plug.""WRONG! the wires inside are so thin and fragile that repairing them was next to impossible. So be forwarned. They are great for the plane but not for people on the go or if you are often exposed to the elements."
5,Great Deal,"These headphones are the best I have ever purchased. They are light weight, comfortable, and sound awsome. I also like the way they fold up."
5,My husband loves these!,"My husband's only request for his birthday was good, travel headphones (NOT earbuds!!) that he could use with his iPod. I went on customer reviews only, because I was not familiar with this brand. Long story short- he loves them, thinks I'm a genius for finding them, doesn't know how he's lived without them! It took him a little practice to get them folded back into their case, but now it's a snap for him and he carries them everywhere. I highly recommend these for anyone who can't use earbuds comfortably AND who want the best, clearest quality from their iPods!"
4,Good phones: I'm on my second pair,"I loved these headphones. They were my substitute pair, used outdoors and to get to sleep, when my more expensive Sennheisers weren't practical to use.I tried replacing them with the Shure E2c in-the-ear plugs. They sounded good, but not as good as the PX 100s. Also, they were impossible to use while walking because I could hear the pounding of my feet and sound of my breath. I'm returning them and buying the PX100s again. Highly recommended!"
1,Cheap quality build with poor sound,"I'm honestly stunned at the high praise these headphones are receiving.1. They feel very cheap and flimsy.2. Sound quality is very poor. Sounds like a pair of headphones I can buy from Radio Shack for $3.3. The cord is very fragile.I accidentally pulled the cord, not too hard, and the headphones stopped working.They are now in the trash where they belong. Very very disappointed. Expected more from Sennheiser. Don't know why they are receiving so many 5 stars from the reviewers here."
4,Doesn't seem as well made as the first one,"I purchased this same product about four years ago and it is still going strong. This time the case was warped or does not quite fit the ear phones as well as the first pair I bought. In fact I don't like the case at all. It takes too long to wrap the cord up and squeeze it into the case. It's not practical. Otherwise, the earphones are good."
4,"Very Good Sound, Great Value","I was looking for headphones for an iPod, to listen to music while my wife watches TV. These are great for the application, and the range of sound is very good...really great for the price."
4,great headphones,"Bought these for my 15 year old son for Christmas. He was very surprised at the sound quality, especially the base. He wears them to school everyday and they are holding up really well. He says they're alot more comfortable than they look. The only draw back is that they take a couple of mins to fold..too long for an impatient teenager. We were both surprised at the quality for the price. Highly recommend them. Thanks to the previous reviews for my choice."
5,AMAZING Headphones,"Our kids all put skull candy headphones on their Christmas lists this year, but after reading poor review after poor review on the quality of the Skull Candy line, we decided to trust the other consumers and go with the Sennheisers. We are certainly glad we did. these headphones sound incredible, they make my noise canceling Sony's sound horrible. That being said we have ordered 2 more pair of Sennheisers - The PX200 II's for my wife and I. Primarily the decision was not based on sound quality, but to differentiate between the kids and ours. But if the PX200II's are as good or surpass the PX100's then I couldn't be happier. we will soon find out as we are awaiting shipment."
5,Great Headphones,I got a Zune for Christmas and the earbuds it came with were lame. I just got these in the mail today and could not wait to try them. All I can say is WOW!! These things sound great!! They come with a nifty little case that the headphones fold down nicely imto. Very light weight for the sound they produce.
5,PX-100 Headphones - For the rest of us!,"I have been searching for headphones to replace the buds that came with my iPod. I tried the new Sony 81's from Japan which sound great, but are not my cup of tea comfort wise. I prefer the over the ear type. After much research and several tries I settled on these Sennheisers. A great choice! The sound is full and rich. Fantastic actually for a pair of headphones under 40 bucks. The open air design does let some sound out and in, but it's not a problem for me. The design is functional and the fit comfortable. They fold up nicely and the case is very portable. I think I have found the match for my iPod. Try 'em...you won't be disappointed."
2,great sound when they work,"These headphones sound good, but the connection between the headphones and the wire, broke immediately. I am returning them for a pair that has better reliability."
2,Sennheiser PX100 -11 review,"I have to agree with the person who had the channel failure. I love the design and feel of this model headphones, but the left channel gave out on mine in only a few months. I had been very careful with these headphones because they were an investment (for me at least), but was so disapointed that they are practially useless now. Shabby cord design and construction shouldn't be on the menu at this price point!"
4,Excellent product with one caveat,"The headphones work great and I love the way they fold neatly into a sturdy plastic case. Beware, though---you have to fold them just right and it takes a LOT of practice---not intuitive at all, which is why I docked one star."
4,I prefer the Koss porta pro.,"I have owned both the PX100 and the Koss Porta Pros for two years, and listen almost daily to one or the other for TV or internet. The porta pros definitely have better imaging, and somewhat better bass, but snag your hair if it's long. The PX100 wins on styling and comfort, but I find after bending the Koss headband out a bit that it's plenty comfortable for me.I've had both models repaired multiple times for wear on the cable jack causing open circuits. The Sennheiser warranty experience was less pleasurable; they tried to steer me towards paying $49 for repair when it was their fault that the new tiny ipod style jack doesn't have a proper strain relief boot. My PX100 just died after the 2 year warranty so I'm replacing it with another Porta Pro instead.The Koss have been more reliable, and their lifetime warranty is easy to use."
2,Broke too easily,These sounded fine and were reasonably comfortable. But the connector to my computer broke after only a few months of use and was not fixable so it was money thrown out.
4,Great sound,"Great sound. Works well when being collapsed and put away in its case. Bothers the ears when wearing spectacles. Some parts of headgear padded. That's fine, but some parts are not and the metal rests directly on the head. Generally good product due to good sound quality."
1,Do not buy it!,"I can't believe I'm saying this about a Piece of peavey equipment! I had a bandit 112 as a teen and I loved it, I talked other people into to buying them also. Me and my buddy were in a band and we both had one and used them at the house to practice and write with. I remember it for its stunning reverb! Now back to this waste of space messenger, why on earth would peavey make a PA with out reverb???? Even if you don't want reverb for seminars and stuff, come on man you have to have reverb on a PA!!! well I'm very disappointed with Peavey for this and have decided to take my money to behringer as they make a messenger also!, a little bigger and more powerful and they were kind enough to not only include reverb but a whole array of digital effects and less expensive too.So in a nut shell, Don't buy a $400 peavey paperweight buy the Behringer Europort EPA150 Ultra-Compact 150-Watt 5-Channel Portable PA System"
2,It fell short for me.,"Good heavens, this novel nearly put me into a coma, it was that dull. I had high hopes for this historical fiction set in Jerusalem as the Templars fight to keep the city in Christian hands, but unfortunately I never felt any connection with any of the characters who are about as life-like as cardboard. The plot was convoluted in the extreme and never really went anywhere....aside from a few battles, I never understood what any of the character's goals were, if any, aside from an overarching theme to keep the Holy Land in Christian hands.Many of the characters had a lot of potential that came to naught. Almost as if they were unfinished.I finished the novel, but only because I kept hoping it would pick up, which never happened for me.This is the first Holland book I've read and I hate to judge an author on only one book, so I'll likely give another a try in the future just so I don't short-change her. If anyone has some good suggestions, I'd love to hear them."
5,book,Excellent. It's like new. I wait one month to received the product. It has the cd's and I dont see any marks in the pages.
4,really good hardcore AZ act,"The Bled of Tucson are one of the many great hardcore acts that are beginning to spring up in the desert state. They have definitely arrived onto the national scene with this first release as it is bonecrushingly loud and chaotic, in a similar vein to early This Day Forward and present day Hopesfall and Norma Jean. They do have a sound that is all their own however, and it remains quite interesting, a considerable feat considering this record focuses on rythm and chaos instead of the melodic interludes the majority of the ""core"" bands have chosen to intertwine in their songwriting. I see a bright future for this band if they continue to tour, engendering a large underground fan base, as the mainstream is not quite ready to embrace this typology of noise."
5,A must-have CD for Belafonte fans!,"If you loved the LP in the sixties, you'll be thrilled to hear the ""Pure Gold"" sound of Belafonte again in the nineties. Don't be put off by the occasionally harsh sound quality. ""Jump in the Line"" and ""Jump Down, Spin Around"" will have you dancing, and the lovely, evocative sound of ""Jamaica Farewell"" will make you want to hop on a plane for Kingston. A great voice and great songs; this is a must-have CD for Belafonte fans."
2,Disappointment for Sourdough Lovers,"When I read James Beard's introduction to his very short chapter on sourdough breads, I wished I had not bought this book. He writes that in his opinion sourdough bread ""is much overrated and is difficult to perfect at home"" and that he is ""not sure it is worth the trouble"". I profoundly disagree. Preparing sourdough is neither too difficult nor too much trouble, and a good sourdough bread such as a French country loave or a German Bauernbrot cannot be overrated! To make things worse the author suggests in his recipe the use of commercial yeast to make the starter, a procedure which most experienced home bakers advise you against. If on the other hand you want some good basic white breads or whole grain breads, you will find interesting and easy to follow recipes. But if your goal is to work on your sourdough techniques - turn to other authors!"
1,Broke under light use in less than one year,"The two metal prongs were welded to screw heads in the base by tiny welds. Eventually these welds gave way, first one side and then the other, so that the metal frame separated from the screws and base plate. I am quite good at repairing things, but this one proved hopeless. I got less than a year's worth of use out of it. I never put more than six bananas on it at once, so I think it should have held up a little better."
4,The perfect banana holder,"Very sturdy & well built. It looks great too. I wish the hook was a little longer to hold more banana bunches, so only 4 stars. I would definitely recommend."
5,Great book!,"I know nothing about plants, so I chose this book because it includes a background of how plant propagation began and evolved as well as multitudes of photographs and illustrations. Perfect for those visual learners wanting an overview of plant propagation and a quick reference for specific plants."
2,Still seeking stories which will make Goatswood come alive,"I wasn't impressed with this collection, though I had looked forward to reading it. I think the Goatswood mythos has possibilities, but these stories didn't light me up and slap my emotions and imagination around the way most of the Chaosium fiction series collections do. Chick says you can miss it."
1,Might be scary for a little one,"Before my 2 year old saw this video she loved Telly. Now, she tells me multiple times a day that she doesn't like Telly or ""the triangle of destiny."" While I thought the video was creative and quite entertaining for a kids movie, I think it scared her. We're going to put it away for a few months and see if she outgrows her fear."
5,AWESOME,"I love this CD. All the remixes were so fun 2 listen 2 (something different, I guess) It was a really ""exiting"" cd 2 listen 2 for the first time. I Love Savage Garden. If I were u (And If u love savage garden) I'd get this cd 2 add 2 your collection. I have all the Savage Garden CDs:1.""Savage Garden"" (The first one)2.""Affrimation""3.""Truly Madly Deeply Remixes""4.""The B-Sides""5.This one6.""Future of Earthly Delights""I suggest u get all of them. They're great!"
1,Very upset!,"Can not get better than 0 stars, because today is December 1, 2009, and I still did not receive this! Even if I receive it soon, I will love the music, but be very disappointed in the service of this vendor."
5,The Best Version,"This by far is the best version of South Pacific I've heard. It puts to shame the new tv movie version with Glenn Close, who can't pull off the little hick act at all. Another advantage the original movie version has over the other is that the original includes the song ""Happy Talk"", but the other doesn't. Even the background chorus in the original triumphs over both the cast version and the new tv version."
3,I liked this CD!,"This is a fun, inexpensive CD. I appreciate that it was available. The sound is a bit fuzzy, but overall, it is fine."
2,say cheesey,"One of the worst zombie movie series I have ever seen no redeemable qualites. awfull acting poor location fake,cheapand amature through out."
3,"OK, but off","This book is entertaining enough, but the characters especially of Carl Lyons are written embarassingly bad. It's ok, not great. You want a really good Stony Man, read Full Blast/Gathering Storm or Silent Arsenal. I also highly recommend any of the Cutting Audio full cast audio books."
4,just a few points...,There's a lot of reviews here already so I just wanted to stress a few points:1. This has strong suction power BUT it doesn't seem to fluff up the carpet as well. You'll have to go over the same area more than once.2. The hose is very short. I'm talking less than 3 feet short. This became an issue when I was trying to go behind my hed.3. The HEPA filter got dirty very quickly. However- you can RINSE it. Great!4. No front light like many other vacuums.hope this helps!
4,good little vacuum,"It's a good little vacuum for the price. A bit smaller than I expected, but would be a good vacuum for an apartment or small house."
3,not 12amp as shows its only 7amps,this is a good vacumm but its not the one shown and the belts and filter it shows to go with it isnt the right ones
5,light weight and convenient size with PoWeR !!!!!,"i got this vacuum for my gift shop. i needed something that i could carry without ramming into breakable inventory. this is not only light and small, it has a convenient, sturdy carrying handle !!!!!the vacuum itself fits into and under small spaces, and the handle drops to the ground so i can reach wayyyyyy back and under low shelves with the head of the vacuum !!!!!what made me love this vacuum first was the fact that the only thing i had to assemble was snapping the handle into the base, no tools, no confusing directions .and it picked up all the dirt, fuzz and lint in the store !!!!!!"
2,Glorified dust mop,"This is a 3 star dust mop and 2 star vacuum. Having hard wood floors led me to believe I could get away with a vacuum on the low end of the price scale, and while with extra effort this machine can get the job done it really is only good for dust bunnies and pet hair. Anything heavier than a dust ball gets spit out the rear due to the spinning brush and in order to get it up you have to hit the material just right or it just kicks it out. Sand, cereal, pet food the suction just isn't there so if your idea of easy clean up for your hardwood involves a quick vacuum and a wet swif this machine will add a lot of time and effort to that process."
3,"Not what I thought, but not bad.","It is a little hard to push over carpet, but it does a great job picking everything up. It's easy to pick up and move from room to room, because it is so lightweight. I don't really care for the way you empty it, but all in all, it gets the job done."
3,Economical price for an economic performance,"We were very happy when we first purchased this vacuum -- $50 was a steal and our house doesn't demand daily vacuuming. And let's be honest -- $500 for a vacuum is just unreasonable.About a year later though, we're really dissatisfied. The hose continues to get clogged up with hair and dust, and the only way to remove it is to take the vacuum apart and manually dig out the hair. It's frustrating beyond compare to have to dig out all the hair and dust you just sucked up.Fifty bucks was worth it at the time, but I'm now on the hunt for something I don't have to disembowel every other use."
2,Not good for serious cleaning,"This vacuum may be okay for small area carpets that don't require much serious cleaning. But it didn't cut it for my purposes; an average sized one bedroom apartment. The cleaning deck is too small; it makes you take a lot more passes over the carpet than is desirable. And the suction power is just not up to snuff. I used it for a couple of weeks and then ended up buying a slightly larger, more powerful vacuum for just a little more money. This product seems like a good deal, but I would recommend spending a little more for a better vacuum cleaner."
3,Convenient product,NIcely packaged and is very useful for small tasks. Some of the feaures for mounting the power cable and accerories leave a bit to be desired. - But it does the job!
4,Good but LOUD!,"The Dirt Devil Dynamite packs a powerful punch for such a tiny vaccuum cleaner. The only drawback is that it is extremely loud. But it is still definitely worth it for the price, so long as you don't mind some slight hearing loss."
4,Good compact vacuum,"Great little bright red vacuum cleaner, and the compact size makes it much easier to store away when not in use (the handle telescopes down into the body). I have taken one star off because when I purchased the Dirt Devil Dynamite Bagless Upright with On-Board Tools - M084650RED, I also purchased the Amazon recommended ""frequently bought together"" extra HEPA filter and the spare belt. Turns out the recommended filter is NOT for this model vacuum cleaner at all, and is about double the size of the one this vacuum uses. Complete waster of money, but not worth the time and effort to return. That annoyed me."
1,so disappointed,"I would not recommend this to anyone needing a real vacuum. This thing isn't even a full size vacuum, it's a mini and way over priced for what you get. Can figure out how to return it...so NOT happy!"
5,Fabulous!,"This is definitely worth the money and more! I just recently moved into a new apartment and after I was settled I vacuumed each room. It sucks up dirt and dust unseen to the naked eye. Apparently there was a heavy amount of sheet rock dust from when the maintenance people cleaned the apartment that I didn't even know was there. This little thing is amazing! It's lightweight and can be easily stored anywhere. The only con (which I don't find that bothersome) is that you will have to empty it quite a bit. I have a 963sq ft apartment and I had to empty the container about 4 times. Even with this hassle, the purchase is absolutely a bargain for the product!"
3,Vacuum,"Works well, but the air filter came unattached as soon as I unloaded the vacuum for the first time. Still works, but the air filter isn't glued on anymore."
2,Not THAT good..,"I do not understand the rave reviews.Here is mine: Initially, good suction and power. Not great, just good. After the first couple of uses, the tiny conical filter gets clogged with dust. I have to clean it out EVERY time I vacuum and I'm only vacuuming about 700 sq ft of VERY low commercial carpet. If I vacuum twice with it, it will barely suck up a small blade of dry grass. Beating the crud out of the filter is a ritual prior to each use. The hose is a joke since it's only 6 inches long. Unless you have extension hose (not included) handy, you will not be able to reach many areas without lifting the cleaner itself. As stated it's a NARROW vacuum, maybe 10"" wide and just doesn't cut it. I've had this cleaner for about 4 months and am now about to buy something else. If someone wants this one, it will be at my next garage sale."
4,Dirt Devil,"Hey, it picks up dirt like gangbusters. It beats sweepers costing many times the cost. If it ever dies, I will just have to get another one."
4,good for the price,"I got this for my one bedroom apartment and it works really well. The cord is very long so you aren't always unplugging it to get the other end of the room. The canister is pretty small, so it probably wouldn't be great if you're doing a whole house. The hose for the attachments is pretty short, and can make it a bit difficult to get the back of the couch if you have a big one. But overall I would reccomend it for an apartment vaccuum."
4,As good as previous oreck xl,"Very pleased with this vacuum. Had an oreck xl 10 years ago that finally died and which did a great job. In between , we've had a Eureka 4870MZ Boss Smart-Vac Upright HEPA Vacuum Cleaner, and a Hoover Windtunnel, both of which continually broke belts and various plastic parts and consumed many bags and have since gone out with the trash. This Dirt Devil is excellent, and cleans up massive amounts of dog hair on visually clean carpets, and the lack of having to deal with bags is a bonus as well. Very powerful suction and light as well. Hopefully it is durable as well (had for only a few months so far).Definitely recommended over anything I've found lately, and probably as effective as an oreck without the cost of belts and bags."
4,Dirt Devil Works,"It's rare that you find a reasonably priced product that works better than expected! It required very little assembly, no tools and was ready to be used in 15 minutes. I love the light weight, which makes vacuuming a one bedroom apt quick and easy. I also appreciate the swirling bar, which stops once the container is full. This is a purchase I'm happy I made!"
2,Planning to return this item,"There is no adjustment for carpet levels. And it is so much tough to move it and can cause pain on shoulder.This is really for 2 room apartment and it takes about 20 minutes for that.Update after using for about 6 months - we are throwing this item. It does not do its job, the dirt remains."
1,It used to work...,"It used to work pretty well for the price that was paid for it, but gradually the suction deteriorated and the dirt devil no longer works."
5,Dirt Devil Dynamite Bagless Upright,Absolutely the BEST vacuum I have ever owned - I recommend this 100% - I can't believe how much pet hair this picks up - what a bargain - rated 5 stars - would give it a 10+
4,Small but Very Comfortable,"I bought these for myself as a Christmas gift. I really wanted just standard Gold hoops of good quality. The Pros are that these are extremely light and comfortable to wear. You won't even notice you have them on. The cons are that they are so small, you'll only want to wear them when you are at work or dressed comfortably over the weekend. If you're like me, they won't be a go-to for an evening out bcause their size makes them look too casual."
5,Love love love!,"I bought these last year. As soon as I got them, I put them on right away and I haven't taken them off since! these are the only earrings I've ever had that has not irritated my ears even once. They are comfortable, light, and pretty! I'll never buy any other earrings that are not from Duragold again! I went and got some two ball studs for my second ear hole too :)"
3,Wow... get close and get a wide picture.,"If you want to take a picture of your couch from about 3 feet away, this is the lense that will do that. I believe it is 86mm verses the 49mm of the current lense. You put the camera into macro mode with the lense all the way in. You go into menu (function-menu, tab 5) and select wide angle lense. You do not get to zoom any more. Tennis shoes to get the right distance. Amazing how close you get before taking the picture. This lense is almost the size of the A2 camera.Super clarity. You can purchase 3rd party lenses that give you wider.Note: sony's digital slr is built in the minolta factory, and takes all the minolta (now rebranded sony) lenses."
5,Prolific Percussionist,"I love the marriage of Latin and African rhythms. Well-recorded with great players/musicians. I have been a fan of ""the Count"" (aka Larry) since he played with ""Operator"" from Atlanta/L5pts back in the '80's."
3,NOT ONE OF THERE BEST,...I do not think that thes two eposidos of sam and diane are not there very best.THey needed the last 2 episiods when shelly long came back.I think shelly was very good on the show....
5,Mantis Sandal Deserves 5 Stars,"This is my first pair of Clarks' and I am very impressed by its comfort.I appreciate cushiony padding at each step, literally.This sandal does not come with any back strap, so the other reviewer may be talking about some other sandal?I will start buying more Clarks sandals as they seem to know what sandals are supposed to be!"
5,Get This Record!,"Even though this is a collection of the demos they had floating around for the last few years, its a VERY solid Cave In release. This is the album that they should have put out after Jupiter."
4,good,"I like the book. The premise is fresh and it is an addictive read. Based on what I have read so far, I would read another of his books."
2,All right,"I was intruiged by an artical in EW and so I read the book. The book was a huge dissapointment thought. There where some times that I found the book good, but it seemed to drag. The intial plot was good but I felt no empathy for Shadow. If you read this book and like it great, it's just that I didn't."
3,Wildly imaginative...but unfocused,"Fans of Jonathan Carrol will love the machinations of this book, but it does suffer some from a lack of focus, and while it has multiple plot lines it doesn't really integrate them very well. It could well have explored some of the peripheral characters (mostly Gods and other supernatural beings) a little more, but it would have made for a very long book. Plenty of room here for a sequel and, if it stayed more focused it could be really great."
1,The Kindle edition is NOT the tenth anniversary text,"Even though the Kindle edition is linked from the tenth anniversary edition page, it is not the tenth anniversary text. Great novel, wonderful to read. But I already own the original version and was specifically looking for the tenth anniversary update."
1,Boring as King in his worst moments,"I can't remember another time I got so bored reading a book. I don't know why Gaiman had to try to be ""as good as Stephen King or your money back"". I wish it were true, the ""money back"" part.. Remember ""Insomnia""? ""American gods"" is just as boring. The story just never grips you: in the first 150 pages (the total length of some masterpieces) NOTHING happens, absolutely nothing, nada! I don't think I'll buy Gaiman again in the future. And BTW ""Neverwhere"" was not bad at all!"
4,Less than brilliant Kindle Edition,"Every chapter on my Kindle Keyboard begins with this:""There is video content at this locationthat is not currently supported for yourdevice. Caption for this video is displayedbelow.""If there's a caption, then I don't need to know about the video, at all. And I certainly don't need to be reminded that there's video that I cannot watch AT EVERY CHAPTER.The original content is a book; don't irritate me with useless additions every 30 pages.Otherwise, it's 5 stars, minus one star for bad editing/publishing."
4,A decent read,"Quite a good, exciting read with plenty of humour. Reminiscent of Pratchett in places, though less absurd. Definitely worth a read and a noticeable improvement on Neverwhere."
4,Worth the ride,"I disagree with those who think the ending fizzled. If you're looking for a sacrine ""happily-ever-after,"" this doesn't have it, but the ending is satisfying and fits the story. Well worth the ride."
2,"Good writing, but drawn out story","I found this story to be quite boring for a while. To sum it up, I didn't really get interested until about the 500th page and then it was over 50 pages later, along with a drawn out resolution to cover all the other loose ends from all the other subplots, which I didn't really care about by then.The writing was good. I just needed something more to keep me interested and after the first couple hundred pages I felt I was reading only to just get the book over with so I can start on another book."
2,American Gods - not worth the time,"I am a fan of the Sandman series, but American Gods was a disapointment. It felt as though a good story had been overstretched."
5,New genre for me,"Fantasy is not my thing -- at least, it wasn't until I read ""American Gods,"" drawn in by the excellent premise that immigrants brought their gods to America, then forgot them, leaving the gods to decline until they finally decide to do battle with Americans' new gods, such as technology.This gets five stars despite a somewhat naff ending, where Gaiman seems to struggle to decide exactly how he wants to end the book. In spite of that, it's worth the read. This is a book with great characters (Shadow, Wednesday, Laura), great places (especially the roadside attractions) and a surprising sense of humor that saw me laugh out loud several times. I thoroughly enjoyed it."
4,Common Fantasy joining mythology and modern fiction,"This was a fun and easy book to read. I didn't want to put it down mostly because it was such an interesting book but also because it was relaxing. The vocabulary is simple and the plot fairly simple to follow. However it twists and winds in a non-confusing way, very obviously keeping information hidden from the main character, Shadow.Either way, this was a simple enjoyable book I could see re-reading a few times in the future."
1,Clumsy,"Admittedly, I read only a few pages. The language was clumsy, the descriptions were mundane, and the characters were goofy. I'm a fan of Gaiman's ""Sandman"" series, but this novel is just childish."
1,A mess,"The book starts out in prison, and immediately kills the first nice character that comes along - Shadow's wife. He is released, and heads for home. We are told of this great love they had, but there is no emotion in this character whatsoever. The next female character devours a partner in the act of sex as he worships her as a Goddess. Honestly, I gave up shortly thereafter. This book did not kindle my interest at all. I had hoped it would be spiritually uplifting, something to link Americans with the deities of their own land. Instead, it began ugly and dark, and I saw little to cause me to think it would improve. Very disappointing, considering that friends had recommended this as a must read. It's a work of fiction, of course, and it seemed to be in the genera of books that take themselves too seriously, where darkness somehow equals depth."
1,For modern fantasy readers only,"I loved Good Omens. I think Neil Gaiman is also pretty cool. But I don't like his books including American Gods and Anansi Boys. American Gods, is a modern fantasy novel. It's gritty. If you like modern fantasy, you may like this book.Admittedly, I do like the Percy Jackson series which is modern, kids fantasy. But it has a very strong theme of heroism. Of saving the day. Which is what I really like about fantasy.Good fantasy is about the world crashing around, and then someone finding their own special way to save it. Of course the world must contain elements of, and generally the saving must be done in a way, that we can't explain using science through magic or some other medium. Fantasy should be immersive. Some philosophy, maybe even something dark or dichotomocially brilliant comedy, and immersive character transformation is what separates great fantasy, from good fantasy.This isn't good fantasy."
1,This won awards? Really?,"Rubish. Good premise, but wasted on a completely unlikable main character who, after being hired as a bodyguard gets kidnapped twice in a several day period. Also bogged down by several x-rated passages that are there only to be x-rated. How edgy! Sorry Neil, I'm sure the Coraline movie will be cute though."
1,Really boring novel...,"Having read several of the Sandman comics, I went into 'American Gods' expecting sharp, incisive wit or at least some degree of dark humor. Sadly, this book delivered neither. The central tenet of the story was interesting, but the basic plot device (i.e. gods mascarading as humans) seemed old after about 30 pages. After that the book was just plain boring. I agree with the other reviewers who said Neil Gaiman should stick to comics..."
3,This thing won a Hugo?,This guy must really be in good with Worldcon voters! Just exactly where is the Science-Fiction element in this mass media indulgence that reads like a Stephen King novel from the 80's ? It is entertaining but certainly not for SF fans.
4,Modern fantasy at its best (almost).,"Neil Gaiman is simply a fantastic (in both senses of the word) writer and a deft hand at generating a palpable world filled with the most bizarre yet believable characters and circumstances.I wasn't certain what I would find in this book and as a Heathen dedicated to Odin was prepared to be generally annoyed and disappointed and Mr. Gaiman's handling of the Gods I walk with. I have never had my expectations more happily obliterated. Mr. Wednesday strikes very true to the old One Eye I know in so many ways and the tale that plays out entangling Wednesday, Shadow and Low Key is worthy of the Gods involved.I also thoroughly appreciated the author's less than subtle dig at the neo-pagan community.If this book were from any other author, it would have garnered five stars from me. However, as a follow up effort to Gaiman's previous novel ""Neverwhere"" this book is actually a little disappointing as it simply falls short of his previous masterpiece."
4,Page turner,"Im becoming a big fan of Mr. Gaiman, American Gods is a rollercoaster adventure ride. I could not put it down. It is lots of fun, great summer reading book. I highly recommend it."
4,gods and everyman,"Shadow, the protagonist, is Everyman, or so he thinks. And no one else is what they immediately seem to be, although their names (Wednesday, Mr Nancy, Mr Jacquel & Mr Ibiss) give them away to anyone raised on a steady diet of mythology and folklore as I was. And what happens to those old gods when we make new ones? I almost expected a comic strip god to show up -superman, spiderman, batman, maybe even tinkerbell - since we have given those creations many of the attributes and expectations our ancestors had for their creations of Jove, Thor, Vishnu, or Isis. And like Tinkerbell, it is our belief that keeps them alive and powerful.Neil Gaiman is one of the finest modern fantasy writers. He holds to the conventions of the genre without being derivative. American Gods was one I enjoyed, passed on to my son, who read it in a weekend, and who has recommended to his friends, all of whom play fantasy games on their computers."
2,American drag...,"Interesting concept, nice style of writing but it starts slow, very, very slowly. Sure it picked up speed a while through but overall I still didn't love it. I simply didn't care about what happend to Shadow, Laura or Odin - none the characters weren't truly developed, nor did I feel that many of the plots were. I had expected a truly brilliant ending for all those 'empty' pages but it never came.I think I need to stop reading highly recommended books. My expectations are too high..."
1,So bad I could not finish it.,"As a fan of creative writing with a good deal of patience, I gave my best effort to get through this novel, but had to give up in frustration. Gaiman's theme, while worthwhile in its premise, is executed poorly through incomplete character development, vulgarity, and pointless detail in scene description. His shortcomings in plot consistency and justification for many characters leaves the reader often asking for more explanation, more development, and too many questions as to what the point of this work is.Given there are so many other works out there much more worth our time and effort, I recommend readers look elsewhere for better creative writing in this vein, such as Neil Stephenson."
1,B O R I N G and Disgusting .... I threw it away!!,"I bought this book when it first came out. I was at the airport and I was travelling cross country and had lots of time on my hands. I gave this book a really good try but it was so incredibly boring, depressing, and frankly disgusting that I ended up throwing the book in a trashcan at the airport.. something I have never ever done. I didn't even want to pass it on to anyone in the event they might enjoy it even though I hadn't. It was just THAT bad.At the time I bought it, it hadn't won any awards. In fact, as I was browsing Amazon, I was shocked to see the rating this has book acquired. I just did not find a man consumed by a prostitute, in a very disturbing manner, all that entertaining (I won't describe it beyond that because I want to keep this review clean). It was, quite simply, gross. The story is depressing, too. Blech. It's just a loser.I am an avid reader and I treasure books. This was not worth the paper it was printed on."
3,Enhancement no enhancement,American Gods was written with Neil Gaiman's usual page turning talent. The Enhancements were a bust. I was unable to view them on my laptop Samsung phone or Kindle touch. No references were made to viewing/listening restrictions at the time of purchase. The books is well worth reading but don't pay for this version if it is going to cost more.
3,Stopped somewhere in Chapter 6.,"Review of author's preferred text version.SPOILERS:The gods when no one(in the old world) believes in them anymore, move (with their few remaining believers, I think) to America (why, I don't know) for a long and miserable retirement.This is an intriguing premise and there is a little moment of ""oh wow"" when you work it out.Therafter... I don't know what, the plot doesn't seem to go anywhere (it may go somewhere after Chapter 6). I could have been carried forward by wanting to know what happens to the characters, but I didn't like any of them enough to care. The old gods are an unpleasant bunch.I think it did win lots of awards - so hey what do I know :)"
1,First novel in 4 years I left unfinished,I've read maybe 90-120 novels the past 4 years ranging from classics like Shakespeare's plays and 19th century Russian novels to Tolkien and Stephen King. For some reason American Gods left me with an utterly disgusted feeling after 70 pages. I threw the book in the trash at Seattle airport. Maybe it was a way too realistic description of our time and society.
5,Gaiman Grows Up,"Neil Gaiman's work is always imaginative, fun and provocative, but this time it's more. He combines myth and history, politics and pop culture, with a variety of characters that ring true as gods, legends and people.The book sweeps across the continent and through 15 millennia, yet it reads as a most personal story.It's really great."
2,"Good idea, nice writing and fun characters...but boring book....","I loved the premise of this book, it was creative and had so much potential. The writing style was fun to read and delicately playful. The characters were neat. However, the plot dragged... and dragged and culminated into nothing....I was very disappointed because at the end of the day if the book doesn't tell a good story, well then it just ends up being a boring and horrendous waste of time."
2,OK book but not half as envolving as I thought it would be.,"I had read you couldn't put the book down, that it was insightful that the story was amazing and thought I didnt hate the book, I kept waiting for something interesting to happen and it never did.I read the book To the Vanishing Point a few years ago and it was simular and I enjoyed that better."
3,"""'The Gods are walking the Earth!"" - Dirk Gently","Odin, the All-Father, is back. ""The long dark tea-time of the soul"" may not be Douglas Adams at his prime, but seems inspirational enough to provide the backbone of another Gaiman's book. This time fictional. His admiration for the work of the now late DA had previously incarnated in ""Don't panic"", a (kind of) biography centered on ""The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"". This isn't supposed to be a detractor of this book. I found it a very enjoyable read, and 3 1/2 would certainly better reflect how I apreciated it. Not a masterpiece by any means though."
3,Too slow,"I came from reading Gaiman's Sandman series, and was intrigued by the concept of Gods that are created as a result of folks traveling from their homeland to America, and the resulting apathy with every new generation. The problem is.. Gaiman takes an incredibly long time to get to the point. After reading about a fourth of the way through, I had a pretty good guess on how it would end. The problem is, I had to read another 3/4ths of the book to find out if I was right. The themes in the book point to a few logical conclusions, which is exactly how it plays out, so the surprise factor I was looking for didn't pan out and I was left feeling disappointed. I will say this much - all the side excursions and tangents Gaiman takes off on in the first half of the book all make sense by the end of the story and Gaiman ties up all the loose ends quite satisfactorily."
2,Nearly Plotless,"OK. I know this book has won just about all the big awards, but I found it to be nearly a plotless meandering that I had to work at to finish. I enjoyed Gaiman's run on Sandman a long time ago, but I don't think I'm a fan of his more recent work, both the Eternals and 1602 made me yawn. This book as well; it's more like a bunch of short stories loosely woven together. I'm not a fan of short stories, so it didn't work for me."
4,Interesting,"This is the first book I've,read by Mr Gaiman. The idea regarding our Gods was an old idea with an interesting twist, well worth the read with rounded characters."
3,Need more light and less Shadow,"Very original, with occasional high points: spooky, funny, clever.. but ultimately it left too many plot points/hints/clues unresolved for my taste. I'm as big a fan of Things Left Unexplained as anybody, but when I finished I found that rather than being awed by the mystery of it all, I was instead just a bit confused. Generally enjoyable though, and I still like the ""Ancient Gods trying to get by in the modern world"" idea that I first saw Gaiman use in Sandman. If you have a good understanding of world religions/mythologies, you should get a kick out of this."
2,"Big pile of ""meh""","I just finished American Gods. I've read that along with his novel Neverwhere and some of his graphic novel series, Sandman. I am prepared to say I don't see why he's such a big deal. I found American Gods to be self-indulgent and mostly just plain boring."
4,Good read,"I'm a new Giaman fan, so what I heard she had written novels I did cartwheels! Though I do love his work I agree that the sending kind of fizzled, though it get great a great ""What the?!"" as it progressed. A great book for students of mythology or any who who wonders about the nature of divinity."
4,A new look at Our World,I really enjoyed where this book took me and found it to be a creative take on religion in the American landscape. There were some areas that got descriptively convoluted which is why I reserved a star but it was still a very interesting and enjoyable read.
2,Grossly over-rated. Wait to get it from the $2 bin if you must read it.,"After reading the author's over-puffed introduction to the book where he states that his 10 year old book was so good that he decided to add more for this edition, I should have stopped there. The story had promise, but wanders all over the place and only about half of what is written actually contributes to the story. Most of it is just rambling crap. It's comical that author feels that just because his characters visit a few roadside attractions and travel to Las Vegas that he has ""captured a sense of America"". Really?..... I don't think so."
3,"Not a waste of time, but not what I had hoped for.","I won't summarize the book, because that's been done. Overall, the book was good and I didn't feel like it wasted my time, however it wasn't everything I had hoped for in the novel.The characters were well done, and you felt for them -- that much I enjoyed. The biggest problem I had with the story was the choppiness in which the characters were introduced. Without trying to spoil the book, the characters are introduced in obscure ways in that I didn't even really know they were being introduced until they were finally fleshed out as the chapters introduce them by giving their general biography -- sometimes millions of years ago without letting you really know what character is being introduced.However, maybe it was my own problem that I didn't understand this device until later in the book, but it made me a little jaded.Overall, it is a good book and I do recommend it. Maybe it would be better after the second read."
4,New to Gaiman,"I am new to Neil Gaiman. I never read Sandman, and first read his novel Neverwhere (excellent). I really enjoyed American Gods, but less than Neverwhere. It is definitely more of an urban fantasy, taking place in our real world with fantastical characters mostly taken from obscure foreign mythology. While Neverwhere toggled between our real world and the fantasy underworld, American Gods takes place all within our real world, implying that the fantastical is happening all around us. I missed the creation of the fantastical world done so well in Neverwhere.In American Gods I did particularly like the interludes in the early part of the book that told the stories of foreign gods as they arrived in America. I found the lead up to battle between the gods to be too drawn out and in the end anti-climactic. But Gaiman's style makes the book very readable."
2,Overrated and Disappointing,"I love unique and quirky and often like a lot of stories with a science fiction or fantasy slant. I had high hopes for American Gods but came away disappointed, and I'm perplexed at how much other people enjoyed it. I struggled through many of the sections and ended up just skimming through the end until the final chapter ... and I don't think I missed much. There were elements I found interesting and one or two developments I found surprising, but character development was lacking and I found a lot of the narrative simply exhausting.The only other thing I had read of Gaiman's was Coraline, which I did like. Maybe some day I'll give Neverwhere a try, but not until I've read something else more rewarding in the interim."
2,So long!,"The premise of this book has been done before. It's a good premise but Gaiman drew the story out too much. The beginning kept me interested, but it got real dull and boring. At times, I kept wondering when things were going to happen. I know it's an epic story and I should sit back and just enjoy the writing, but I started not caring. The final 50 pages of the book finally picked up, but I had to trudge through 500 pages to get there.I actually liked some of the side stories more than the main story.First Gaiman book and I don't know if I want to read another if this book is indicative of his other books."
3,"Well Written, but ....","This is a well written story but I feel that he coped out. I like the premise of the story, but how can he talk about gods in America and not mention the Judeo / Christian God. Yeah these other gods, Odin, Loki, ..... have been forgotten and not worshipped, but what about the God that is. No matter if you are a Christian, Jew or atheist, this country is built on those Judeo Christian beliefs. Yet not even a page dedicated to God. Too controversial? Too much heat from people who would object to the idea that gods are created by man and not man created by god. I've never been one to think that man is the center of the universe (God help the universe if we are), but I feel Neil could have taken the next step and talk about all the American gods and GOD in general. None the less, it was a good read, just not a great read. My two cents worth."
1,What was Michael Chabon thinking?,"I love Michael Chabon and I bought this book because the cover contained a supportive quip from Chabon. I'm 100 pages in and I have found no compelling reason to be interested in the story or any of the characters. It reads like the random wishful thinking of a 17 year old boy. It is full of scenes where just as it looks like the protagonist is in dire straits, some unexpected super natural randomness saves the day. It might make a good movie for me to watch because at least I would be soothed by my bowl of popcorn and the knowledge that it would be over in 90 minutes. I think I must have dipped into a genre that's not for me. There must be an audience for this novel, but I'm not part of it. I'm moving on to something else."
2,This is considered good?,"How could this have won a nebula award? My how far we have fallen.The characters and events are utterly unbelievable and one dimensional. Worse is there any character that has, well, character in this novel?It is filled with foul language and unnecessary and graphic sexual content. The heroes are all idols and devils. The ugly profane and evil are glorified. I'm amazed I actually read the entire book, and that is perhaps why I gave it as much as 2 stars. The author manages a clever enough plot-line to serve as a distraction whilst squatting on the toilet or waiting in a doctor's office."
3,"Good Picture, Used to be good Audio","My tv has recently developed a severe audio popping sound that comes and goes. Its a loud instant pop through the speakers, that will jolt you, no matter what the volume level is at. Usually , I would never down a Sony , but Im afraid my search for what I thought would be the best in tv's, is coming up short.Besides that, the picture is excellent and when you forget about the 'pop' the sound is good too."
3,"OK, but not sufficient by itself for a beginning beekeeper.","This book has the advantage of a number of full-color photographs, and is interesting in that it describes how bees are apparently kept in Europe. However, it is quite brief, and a beginning beekeeper would not be able to start succesfully with only the information in this book. It should be considered to be a supplement to other texts."
2,Not quite enough,"This book is fine for a young school kid for learning simple basics about beekeeping. But for anyone who really wants to learn about beekeeping this book isn't for you. The author used leaf hives, not the more common box hives, and anyone who is a first-time beekeeper would find leaf hives difficult to construct and use."
3,"Inventive, but hard to follow","Like a few other reviewers, I wanted to like this book, but found it hard to get into. The storyline moves forwards in fits and starts, instead of flowing along one common thread. This makes it very hard to engage in the book's plot and relate to the story's characters.If the reader is an AVID fantasy fan, I could see this book being worth the read. But this is hardly a book for the casual fantasy reader, a la most of the Harry Potter audience.A solid first book, but a first book none-the-less. Hopefully, future books will prove more consistent and easy to follow."
5,Next installment please...,Great book. Rockin logo. Do you sell T-shirts? Baseball caps? ACTION FIGURES????
5,Bravo!,"This is one of the best ""first books"" I've read in a long time. Smoothly flowing story, overall, though some instances of dialogue were awkward. I LOVED the wide variety of characters... humans, satrys, centaurs, dryads, griffins, dwarves, and more... but some of them were introduced rather quickly. I'm looking forward to the second title in the series, but I'd think PTC's imagination would need some time to recover after all the adventure packed into this one. :~)""Life is too short to read a badly-written book."" ~ T.M."
3,Nice pc,"I really like this tablet. Writing on the screen is very smooth( with WACOM technology). It also works amazing while I read PDF file. I would not go back to regular Laptop.Asus made very powerful PC but weak user's manual and services( you had to search informations by yourself and without live chat.)HP did the better job in both product & services, but the screen is smaller. that's why I go for this one. I'll recommend HP. This screen (Asus) is longer but not bigger. Don't be fooled by the number(my feeling, might wrong.)"
5,Just a good price for a basic product,"I bought this just to see if it will help carry my 6 pod harness and remote. Tried it out at home and so far so good, adjusts pretty big."
5,STRESS FREE FOR GOOD,This book is excellent. It was an quickread and very helpful. I would recommend it to anyone who wants a quick and easy system to less stressed out you.
5,End the problems of stress for good!,"I've read lots of books and listened expensive tape programs on stress management. They helped some, but caused problems in that the excercises were too time comsuming, didn't always work, took too long to work, or was just to expensive. The techniques offered in Stress Free for Good are simple, quick (takes only 1 minute), and incredibly powerful. I've never felt so good in my life. I've never been so efficient in all my tasks and responsibilities either. The quality of my work has also improved. This is the only book you'll ever need on the topic!!"
3,CLASSIC TEXT,As an art major I used this text in college and now use it to teach drawing to adults. Many books on the subject but I still prefer this one to learn the fundamentals. It was not in mint condition when I received it but was certainly useable and worth the cost. Thank you!
2,Doesn't work for me,"I bought this book on the strength of the reviews it had received, and i am sorry i did. I simply have not been able to make any headway into this book and it's drawing methods at all. It is a much more structured approach than the 'right side of the brain' books, which i found immediately accessible.Perhaps this book is better suited to a structured learning environment. Either way it didn't work for me."
3,buyer be aware,"I haven't seen this video. But I HAVE ordered MANY free video from the centers for disease control. they have a website, you can print out an order form and send it in. They have great videos about the dangers of smoking. And ""Brandon's Story"" is a free video about the dangers of teen DUI available for free from the century council. So, if you're a counselor like I am, trying to find resources, get the free ones first. That's my recommendation."
2,More like an infomercial for Accelerade than a good book,"I carefully read the reviews of this book and purchased it hoping to improve my weight and aerobic training. I reached a plateau in my training and definitely reached the overreaching/overtraining phases. I had hoped this book would provide me some answers.Unfortunately, after the first 50 pages (of which the pertinent information could fit in two paragraphs) I got the point: buy overpriced sports supplements. It is almost as if the authors were commissioned by the sport supplement industry (e.g. Accelerade).Having just recently reclaimed my physical health by designing and following an all natural balanced way of eating I found this book to be disappointing."
3,Read between the Lines,The book was good and filled with interesting information. I actually tried the routine and thought it worked for to increase my stregnth. But the whole book was a sales pitch. If you could rad between the lines and create your own mixes instead of buying their product which is being sold to you in every page then its pretty decent.
2,not worth it,"Unless this is the first you are reading about timing meals and their composition when weight training, the majority of this information is already scattered across the internet in free articles. If you already follow much of the Berardi et al stuff around this subject, this won't add much to your knowlege base."
4,Very Educational Book,"I learned a lot from this book about nutrition and exercies. It explained things like glycemic index, fast twitch and slow twitch muscle types, anaerobic and aerobic exercise states very well. I have come across these elsewhere but I felt I really understood them after I finished this book.It also documented well the various states your muscles go thru -during exercise, 45 minutes after excericse, and the period after that.If there is one thing you should take away fro this book it is drink a carbohydrate/protein(whey) drink before, during , and after excercise."
5,A New Classic Coming-of-Age Story,"Padgett Powell has created an unforgettable character in Simons (""...it's pronounced Sim-mons. I'm a rare one-m Simons"") Manigault, a 13-year-old smartass whose tenuously divorced parents want different things from him: Dad, in self-exile on Hilton Head, wants him to play baseball; Mom, a college professor the locals call The Dutchess, lets him sweat out a public school career in Edisto during the day and sneak into black roadhouses at night, all to gain ""material"" to become a writer. Then a mulatto process server arrives looking for the household maid's daughter, and all hell breaks loose. The maid skips and The Dutchess assigns Simons to the process server's temporary male-role-model custody. Read the rest. A great, entertaining, funny romp through the New South. Buy it or be a loser."
2,don't buy,"I purchased this PDA new and with in 1 week the time was off (new batteries also) the alarm only worked part of the time, so it was useless to me being that the reason for purchasing it was to remind me of meetings and appointments. I did like the case design but trying to figure out how to make everything work is somewhat difficult and I am usually good with electronics. I can't imagine someone with a limited skill with electronics trying to make this work without using the manual constantly. I have read where there is a problem linking it to your computer but I never tried it before sending it back and buying a Palm. I thought I could save some money and get by with this one but no chance. So my recommendation would be to spend the extra money and get one that's been proven to work well."
1,Refurbished need more Re,"Take care in purchasing the factory refurbished, although they look new they may still be unuseable."
1,Very Disappointing,"The Sharp OZ-290H is inexpensive, and that is the only good thing about it. The size of the print on the screen is too large to allow me to view an entire name and phone number or an entire address together. The screen is cluttered and not easy to read. The navigation is awkward and clumsy. The cover is a piece of cheap molded plastic.This is not the inexpensive replacement for address book / calculator /calendar that PDA's originally promised to be."
2,Awkward data entry,"Well, technically, it does everything it says it does. but data entry is awkward, having to toggle between the ""calculator"" screen for numbers and the alpha screen for letters, and then going to a whole other screen for symbols. For the reminder section, I can not turn off the alarm for my entry's. Takes me an average of 4 times to input any one entry.Pedometer is great, but the clip of the case isn't great, and keeps unhooking from my belt. plus it counts normal movement such as lifting the unit as a step, so not entirely accurate.Overall, this takes so long to use, it was a waste of my money and I find myself reverting to the post-it method of remembering things."
1,This isn't even deserving of one star!,"If you are looking for an organizer do NOT buy this. It takes for ever to enter information into it and there are no helpful features that help you repeat calander entries. The calander only holds one scheduled event a day. As for birthdays you can also hold only one per day.If you only want a spanish/engilsh translator, buy this. If you want a ""personal organizer"" I highly suggest you do some more research and get something that will be useful to you."
4,Good product,"This is a good alternative to an expensive PDA. It holds a lot of information. The only thing I would like to change about it is to be able to look someone up by Company and not last name. I also have not got the download function with outlook express to work yet, but it serves the main purpose of keeping all your numbers and addresses in one place."
3,Good while it lasted,I only used it for the calendar and it worked as expected. The one thing I didn't like was the difficulty in adding multiple events to one day. My biggest con is that the display deteriorated to the point of being useless after three years.
5,Relive the Glory,"Forty years ago, men set foot on the moon. This is the definitive story as told by the men who were there, many of them now close to eighty years of age. The DVD set encompasses the science and politics of spaceflight, from project Mercury to Apollo, to the Space Shuttle's triumphs and tragedies. The early films have been enhanced and are visually stunning, especially the incredible Saturn V rocket footage. For those of us who were young during this time, it will rekindle and enrich your childhood experiences of this great historical period. Share this film with your family, as the DVD will make a good primer when America returns to the moon in 2018."
5,Space history 101,"I bought these on a gold-box deal and I'm glad I did. I was born a month after the first American was launched into space, so missed out on the significance of how hard it was to conceive of ""leaving the earth"".I'm watching it with my kids who think space travel is no big deal. They are fascinated by the issues raised in the videos (will their eyes function in zero gravity?) and we have to pause the videos a lot to talk about what we're seeing.It was the last generation of real heroes. These men fit the bill and acted heroically - as opposed to the ""rock star"" hero and the ""extreme sport"" hero that my kids are offered by the media.Buy it and watch it together as a family and talk about it. You won't regret it."
2,amazon technology buggy and unproven,I downloaded this for my kids--after 4 hours it was ready--then would not play and started downloading all over again. Support would seem to be nonexistent--Amazon should stick to books
1,Don't buy this you will be sorry,"After having the Model 1 radio for many years and using it daily, I asked for Christmas for this unit as a replacement for my old clock radio. I'm now on the third unit and it has been a complete disaster. The first arrived with the cabinet damanged. The second, the radio didn't work. The third, the clock doesn't work. On top of it, the clock is a cheap battery powered clock that you can get anywhere for about $2. yes the radio works but after the first day being late for work, I was ready to toss this piece of over-priced junk in the trash. And that's what it is, Way over rated, over-priced, cheap junk made in China. Now I have to pay another shipping charge back to some company called HIDEF Lifestyle and hope for a refund."
3,Way over praised and priced,"OK, it looks nice and sounds pretty good. Buy a Model One and you've got a nice enough product. You can buy far better clocks; the FM is OK in mono, but don't bother trying to upgrade to a second speaker or send the output to stereo, because it's noisy; AM is no better than any cheap radio (and who cares); the ""Retro"" look is fake, because they use modern, cool small type in a bland-on-bland color scheme that's impossible to read in low light. Kind of a pain to use except as a little table radio... Like the much cheaper Model One."
4,Attractive Radio with Annoying Weakness,"A vendor was selling the Tivoli Model Three for 66 dollars via Amazon so I could not resist. I'm glad I bought it but it has an annoyance: If I leave the room, the reception seems to drift a bit on AM or FM. I know this because the Model Three has a light that glows amber green when you've hit the reception ""sweet spot."" Often I'll re-enter the living room and the green is no longer glowing and I can hear static. If I'm reading nearby, this is no big deal. I assume this radio would benefit from a telescopic antenna instead of its piggy tail in the back. Having made this criticism, I love the look and sound of this radio. But if you're new to radios, start with the best radio for the money, the Sangean PR-D5, about $75-85. Unlike the Model Three, the PR-D5 has dual stereo speakers, telescopic FM antenna, internal 200 mm ferrite AM antenna, PLL synthesized tuning, and digital presets."
1,Sizing???,Would be interested in purchasing one of these but the product description gives the same demensions for each size????Give sizing information plese.
2,HELP!,"I bought this charger and charged it to my moms credit card because I lost the charger to my Nikon d300. Well, the charger arrived in good timing (two days) but it WILL NOT charge my battery, I seriously need advice or help or something because I'm afraid that I wasted 45 dollars on a charger that does not work. am I doing something wrong? please anybody feel free to respond."
3,she went to my camp!,"dar williams was a camper at aloha in 1980, the place i am happy to promote. but i will also review her album. she has a sweet, airy and breathy voice that untangles her songs into pleasant listening. however the lyrics could reveal a little more. give ""mercy of the fallen"" a try, it's her best song. ""beauty"" is a little less folky than the green world, more country. but it will not disappoint dar fans."
2,Overproduced and blah de blah,"I was let down. Dar usually comes sparking unexpectedly out of album collections and demands that you recognize her lyrics - toes tapping or spontaineous singalongs. Stories casting a spell with a quiet intensity to them.Not this album.There's simply to many washes of synthesized sound that cover her voice and edge. (Things that made previous songs endearing and impactful.) This 'New Age' sound has swallowed up the vibrant and immediate nature that I was drawn to, but perhaps this could be for you. If you enjoyed music such as Joni Mitchell's latest work or something closer to Enya's otherworldly vibes - check it out."
5,"Of Course I Love It, It's Dar","Okay, I adore this CD. I love Dar's earlier work, but there are some songs on The Honesty Room and Mortal City that I have never felt like listening to. I can't even say what my favorite songs are on this CD--every one is amazing. 'I Saw A Bird Fly Away' and 'Fishing in the Morning' stand out a little extra. The guests here (John Popper, Bela Fleck, Alison Krauss, etc!) are genius, and I bet these songs were fun to record! Personally, I love that Dar does not stick to the same formula over and over--she continually reinvents her music and she does it in a really interesting way while still tapping into my emotions like no one else. If you are a Dar fan, you NEED this CD. And if you don't know her music yet, I'm so happy that you're checking it out!"
2,painful,"These earrings sit unworn on my wife's dresser because they're uncomfortable to wear. Apparently the pin that fits through her earlobe is flat, which stretches out the hole."
1,Hoop erarrings,I wish I had looked at the earring specifications. I was really surprised to see how really small these hoops were.
5,Perfect ~ getting another pair,"These were a Christmas gift for my sister. I was happy to see that they were exactly as described and she loved them. Unfortunately her wallet was stolen and they were in it at the time. She liked them so much she wants to replace them. Since they are such a good price, I plan on replacing them for her."
5,The best present!,"I bought this for my wife for Valentines Day and she was elated. I also got the white gold earrings. She said they were the perfect size and weight. When she's happy, I'm happy."
5,Just what I expected!!,"I love these earrings. They are the right size and the right price!!! I had read previous positive reviews on these earrings, so I bought them and I wasn't disappointed."
5,Nice quality earrings,"I was very pleased with the quality of these earrings, which I got for my wife for Mother's Day. She loved them! The clasp is nice and sturdy."
5,Wife loved these,"I'm a typical guy that is basically clueless about jewelry, but I can certainly appreciate the ease of buying something on Amazon as opposed to going to a jewelry store and dealing with salespeople trying to push expensive products. My favorite move is when they take out their calculator and magically apply some unknown discount to what may or may not be a sticker price. My wife absolutely loved these earings - I don't know exactly why - but if your loved one is asking for gold hoop earrings these are the real deal."
4,"Bendy, but great earrings nevertheless","I've went through several gold hoops before settling on these. They're the perfect size - not too big, not too small. My only complaint is that the closure bends very easily. I feel like I'm going to brake them every time I take them off."
3,Great start to a brilliant career,"I was working in a jazz and classical music store when this album (yes, album!) was first released. My manager handed it to me and said, ""Check this out. It is up your alley."" He could not have been more correct. I have followed Benny's career since first listening to this CD and have never looked back.The highlight is a nice version of ""Peresina."" Benny's version of this tune always brings a smile to my face. The band is fairly tight and all the tracks are good. Listening to this recording today, I immediately see just how much Benny has grown as a musician over the past 15 years. The brilliant performances you hear on recent recordings are not going to be found on this CD. On the other hand, the performance is very good and better than what we hear on most first releases. So do not let the fact that this is an early performance stop you from purchasing this CD. If you are fan of Benny's music and want to hear where it all began, this is the recording to buy."
1,Don't fit and are of poor quality,"Title says it all. Take some advice, don't skimp on an improper filter. You paid a lot of money for the Honeywell filter unit, use the proper filter."
1,No Good,"I purchased this ink for my Dell All-In-One Printer 946. For some reason I thought this ink was compatible, well it isn't! Perhaps I read it incorrectly when I purchased this item...."
5,ProMotion does WONDERS for older dogs!,"PorMotion by Virbac produces amazing results for the older dog who starts slowing down.We started our 11 year old cocker on Promotion when she began to have trouble getting up and down and going on long walks. After 3 weeks on ProMotion, following the instructions to double the usage for the first few days to get the product on board...she was up and down and back to hiking. She stayed on daily usage full of vim and vigor for 19 years. Our 8 year old Schipperke is just beginning to slow down so we have started her on Promotion...she loves the new bacon flavored taste and takes it like a treat! (We crushed the tablet between two spoons and put it in our Cocker's food. She'd always lick the bowl clean!) GREAT product!"
4,Not a big Elvis fan...but love this CD,"I have never been a big Elvis fan, but I very muchenjoyed listening to his gospel music. Very nice"
5,THE KINGS MOST BEAUTIFUL ALBUM,"""How Great Thou Art"" is one of the greatest albums ever done by a popular singer. The beauty and passion that comes through is riveting .You dont have to be religious to enjoy this masterpiece ,just sit back and be enthralled by Elvis and his talented musicians and backup singers.A++++++++"
5,Brings back memories,If you ever watched and loved the Mary Martin version of Peter Pan as I did when it used to come on TV you will love this CD. It is just like watching the show once again. The music is wonderful and kids today will love to sing along.
5,Perfection!,"Every note, every lyric from Mary Martin's throat is crystal clear, exquisite perfection! If you are of a ""certain"" age, tears will spring to your eyes at the first notes. Never Never Land is a song that goes beyond the magic island where Peter lives to an ode to finding your place in the world and happiness.It may be miles beyond the moonOr right there where you standJust keep an open mindAnd then suddenly you'll findNever never landThe Jule Styne / Betty Comden and Adolph Green music is glorious and should be perfomed more often. What a showcase this music would be for young singers."
4,Missing a few essentials,"A ""Best Of Bobby Fuller"" collection that includes ""Phantom Dragster"" but leaves off ""Never To Be Forgotten"" is a little suspect, but the real selling point here is the original mono single mixes, including the rare early version of ""Take My Word"". Buy it for that reason, but you'll need much more to get the full picture."
4,Shrek dronkeys,"My grandchildren love these little animals. They are 4 and 2 and I would say that they are very durable. Their colors are great and their expressions perfect. They like to take them when they go places. I would buy this toy again but as far as educational, I would guess I would have to say imagination is as far as it goes."
4,Like watching a Spencer Tracy/Katherine Hepburn movie,"A WINDOW IN TIME is a light time-travel romance that educates the reader about The Pony Express at the same time. Nothing too complicated and some far-out premises, take this for what it is: two romances in different times with HEA endings.The main H/h have some humorous moments with their clever quips and witty banter, a he-said, she-said type of romance. Actually I was surprised a liked it. Usually I am turned off by arguing but Ms. Lampman endears the reader to the characters. Just don't expect much and you won't be disappointed."
4,So far so Good,Bought these as a gift and I have not given them to her yet. But I showed them to some female friends and they thought they were gorgeous.
5,Super earrings,"These are durable. I probably have worn them for two years straight- swimming, taking swim caps on and off . And I never lost or broke one.They are small and lovely and simple."
4,Looks really good,I ordered this to present it to my wife and I really liked when it arrived. Very well made and looks brilliant. But it was a bit small than expected.
3,They seem good value.,I read some good reviews on these so I bought them rather than shop around department stores where 14k hoops were over a 100 bucks.They look well made and the catch is strong.I guess we'll see how they are holding up in 12 months time.That will be the proof.
2,Very small,The description on this item needs to make it clear that the earrings are extremely small. I thought I was ordering an adult medium size earring. The earrings came and look like they are for a child.
4,Duragold 14K white gold hoop earrings,"They are very nice and light weight although I would have liked them to be a bit larger. It was difficult to determine the size as I'm not very familar with metric sizing. It did state that they would arrive in velvet bag, (just in a plastic bag inside a small box) however, as they were for myself and not a gift it really wasn't important."
2,Far too Small,"When this item arrived, it was a very small loop ear-ring. Though nice quality, the smallness of the loop caused it to have trouble even fitting over the ear lobe....very dissappointed and will be returning."
2,Not impressed,"Gold has a dull finish and were smaller than I thought they would be. If you like loops that are nearly invisible, then you will like these."
4,lcd computer monitor AND tv turner,Great lcd monitor. The tv tuner was very usefull but the 2009 switch to digital tv will make that part useless.
2,Quality problems persist,"Sorry to report quality problems appear to persist. I just received Season 3 (marked as ""Best Buy exclusive"")from Amazon, and Volume 1 Disc 1 freezes every 5-10 seconds in my DVD player. I didn't experiment with any of the other discs in my DVD player, but I did try a couple of discs from the set in my Blu-Ray player, and they don't get past the opening ""Warning"" and ""Infinity Entertainment"" screens. This is really too bad, because the quality of the image is quite good, but pretty unwatchable in 7-second chunks."
4,Orlane Eye Cream,"First got a sample of this product at Neiman Marcus and decided to try it as my eyes were looking a little tired - even for someone over 50! I noticed that a couple of weeks later under my eyes looked a lot better in terms of texture and lines. The only change I had made to my routine was using this cream in the morning and at night. So, I bought the product. It is a little expensive, but a very little goes a long way as it is very light and so it should last a while. Don't know what's in it, but it works for me. I have already recommended it to friends."
1,Full of dramatic errors,"As a semiconductor device specialist, I am shocked by the huge amount of errors in this book. Just two examples (my wordings):""silicon is not a semiconductor, it becomes one only when it is doped with particular impurities."" (page 27)""MOS is not a type of electronic device, but instead a type of chip made from Metal-Oxide semiconductors."" (Pages 94-95).It is unbelievable that such writing has gone to print without (apparently) any sanity check on the technical content. The lack of accuracy renders this account of recent history useless."
2,Just plain lame,"God, this has to be the most badly edited movie ever! It's like a student film. And as far as soft core goes, it's pretty awful. The only scene worth a damn is the lesbian one, but don't think you'll be seeing anything more than breasts. It's not that kind of movie. If you want to see Erica Gavin in a good movie, watch ""Caged Heat"""
3,Nice to Hear Again,"I bought this when it first came out in album form. It is good to hear again. Great muscianship, vocals and some clever lyrics. I remember back when my buddies and I would sit and listen to this and track by track we could tag which bigtime band they were going for. Guess Who was always great at mocking the style of other bands and for this same reason they never were taken all that seriously as a force to compete with bands like the Doors, Zepelin or for God's sake the Beatles. If I'm not mistaken, their name implies that you should wonder from song to song ""who"" they are trying to sound like. Good listening here, but this is the best they had to offer and it is only a second tier in the layer cake of rock."
1,Broken after 3 times used,"My mother bought me this for Xmas... Used it 3 times... Worked great...Then, no longer functioned at all. Called customer service... waited on hold for approx. 30 minutes to be told there was nothing they could do if I didn't have the receipt. (My mother is 80 and didn't save the receipt.) The woman in customer service suggested I just go out and buy a new one... I said, I think I'll do that, but it won't be a Toastmaster! I'm not impressed at all."
5,Really good value and works great!,"I had quite a job deciding on which machine to buy as all seemed to have some negative reviews so i opted for the cheapest and am very happy with it!My very first attempt at basic white bread turned out ok,but sagged a little while baking,so i adjusted the ratio of liquids to flour slightly which seemed to cure that problem.To prevent the crust from being too brown i have started using the sweet bread setting as this bakes for 10 mins less than the basic setting. i have also reduced the sugar in the basic recipe by half this seemed to cure the too brown crust problem and also made the bread less sweet which i prefer!So now i am getting bread just the way i like it everytime.I think its a great little machine and i am very pleased with it."
5,Great results - low price,"I feel in love with the idea of a bread maker while housesitting for friends. However, I didn't want to pay as much as they did. This machine solved my problem. I can make all the same bread as they do and for 1/4 the price. I was worried when I read some of the other reviews but I took a chance anyway. My only advice is ""follow the directions"". When doing the inital burn off, keep the lip up! There is no melting if you keep the lid up."
1,100% Dissatifaction after 33 days!,"I cannot review this item because I never received it! 33 days after ordering it, I am now engaged in a skirmish with Amazon.com to honor its ""A-z Guarantee"" to stand behind Marketplace purchases. AMAZON MARKETPLACE BUYERS BEWARE!!!"
2,Not What I Was Hoping For,"I have had this breadmaker for about a year and have yet to get a good loaf from it. They either don't raise, or are dried out. The dough cycle works fine, however. This machine also needs a lot of attention. You just can't start it and leave the area. The beeps are not very loud and when you do hear them, you have to be there to scrape the pan and tend to the dough. My previous bread maker was a Panasonic and I have, upon occasion, gotten it out to make bread instead of using this new one. The old one still works fine, even though it is at least 10 years old. (The only reason I bought a new one was because I didn't like the shape of the loaf from the old one.) I should have bought another Panasonic!!"
4,"Excellent historical angle, very interesting","Excellent historical angle, very interestingThis documentary covers memorabilia and market strategise about the founders of the Coke product. I found it interesting and enlightening"
2,So much unrealized potential.,"With the list of names associated with this text, it's greatness seemed to be a no-brainer. But it wasn't so. The Dust Off Their Feet provides a poor retelling of Acts from Brian McLaren, who is usually a wonderful storyteller. It then goes on to provide some sub-par essays from usually great thinkers. These essays are great for people new to Biblical interpretation and hermeneutics, and that's about it. I was very let down and had hoped for much more than what I read."
1,Oh my...,"I don't know if the minature was exposed to air and the fragrance gone bad or if it really stinks ""green"". It landed in the trash."
5,As Beautiful a Voice as I Remember!!,"Kate Smith's voice is incredible and I hadn't heard her rendition of ""God Bless America"" in many years, though there never was anyone that could sing it like she did. With so many anti-American voices both outside & inside of our country, I decided I'd order this album & enjoy once again, the Strong Sweet voice of Patriotism & I was most certainly not disappointed. Her other songs on the album were delightful but the power of the great song ""God Bless America"" resounds once again & am so glad it was available."
2,defective c.d.,"cd is defective. 14 tracks listed with printed sequence of songs on CD was not followed. all songs listed were mixed. for example: ""how greaet thou art"" is listed as #5 but was actually #10. near the conclusion of this song, there is an interruption in the music (defective recording)! additionally, 3 of the 14 selections listed on cd were NOT on the CD (i..e, ""that old feeling"", ""there goes that song again""; ""somebody else is taking my place"".the purpose of notifying you of this quality problem is to enable you to recheck your inventory and take action to insure that some future buyer will not be faced with the same problems."
5,Excellent value and quality,"We really researched this purchase and are very pleased with the television, the price we paid, and the delivery service we received thru Amazon. Excellent picture quality, make sure you look thru the settings available to you, you can pretty much adjust it to your personal taste. Delivery guys were great, polite and cleaned up everything, took trash with them. All in all a positive experience."
2,"Not ""organic""","The product seems good enough, but I'm dinging the rating because there is no ingredient list on the product page, and because once I got it I found out the the only thing ""organic"" besides the name is the raisin flavor!"
3,"Engaging history, fitful plotting","Engaging read for those who prefer to learn history through fiction. I wish he hadn't grown so cautious with the recent history; the speculative meeting on Spion Kop should have been grander. Didactic style occasionally tiresome, e.g. ""There were five interesting things about the bushmen..."" (my paraphrase) and by the way, the most outlandish of these ""things"" seems unsupported, (no pun intended)!"
5,Very cute book!,"Boy, is this ever cute! when a little boy puts an alligator egg in the Birds' nest, they take care of it as if it was their own. They sit on it until it hatches then when he does, they feed it constantly! It's funny watching an alligator eating all that ""bird food"" and still grows huge. The end is particularly nice. They decide it's time for ""Junior"" to learn to fly but instead, he learns to swim. Sure is a cute story - especially on caring for others. Highly recommend!"
2,Kindle edition disappointing,"A disappointing kindle edition of a lovely old story. Badly laid out, some screens just blank, pictures too small. Works slightly better on ipad, but layout could still be better. Expected more for my money. Don't bother with the e version, get it in print."
1,Disappointing in the extreme,"This was my third pair of Sennheisers. The previous two were just magnificent, so I was really looking forward to getting these to replace the PX100 I'd worn out.The first pair, the sound was so tinny that I assumed that they were defective and sent them back for replacement. The second pair sound just as bad. The description borders on false advertising, since the bass response was practically non-existant. So now I'm debating to go back to the trusty PX100 or look for a non-Senn alternative."
2,Fisher Price Headphones,"I like Sennheiser products. A lot. My favorite being the HD280. I also have the Sony MDR V6 and Grado SR60i.I thought these Sennheiser PX200 would be really good - but what the pictures don't do is give you an idea of how small, flimsy, and cheap they feel. The label should say ""Fisher Price"".Anyways, these were supposed to be a gift. I returned it and ordered a pair of Sony MDR V6 instead for approximately the same price.I'm very disappointed in these headphones."
4,Good with some drawbacks,"It has very good sound quality for the price and can isolate noice to some extent. This is the best headphones I have ever owned, but I have not owned a more pricy one. However you probably are still going to be amazed by its sound quality if you are upgrading from some crappy headphones.It is comfortable to wear but can start to feel uncomfortable if you are wearing it for too long.It is well built and survived my backpack together with many other items. i did not put it in the box it came with."
4,"good treble, weak bass, watch the cord","Very good treble. The bass seems distant and difficult to boost enough for good balance. Don't buy these if you're a bass junkie. Also, these come with a novel carrying case which make them very portable when not in use. However, you have to be especially careful not to pinch the cord with the case cover, which would basically instantly ruin the headphones."
3,Good for commuting,"I've been using these headphones for over two years now, and they've become my ""beater"" pair--the ones I use if I'm wrestling goats or doing the biathalon and I happen to want to listen to music at the same time. For reference, when I'm at rest and I want to really hear what's going on with the music, I use either my Etymotic ER4P earbuds or (when I don't want to cram something deep into my skull but I do want everyone around me to know that I really, truly do like Journey) my Grado SR-80 headphones.The PX200 sounds OK but cannot be compared to higher-end headphones like the Grados, though they're bliss compared to those POS things that come with every iPud. Still, for the price, you can get better. The advantages of the PX200:Folds up small.The cushioned cups keep you from being shamed in public when you just gotta start rockin' with DokkenWell-constructed and can take being thrown in a bag with sunglasses, small arms, and a BLTDisclaimer: I do not actually like Journey."
1,Speaker not functioning upon delivery,One of the speakers was non-functional upon delivery so it is the process of being returned to Sennheiser under warranty for replacement. Purchased as a Christmas gift so Amazon's 30 days to return an item limit was exceeded prior to the package being opened and the defect discovered.
5,Great product at a great price- noise be gone!,I bought these headphones with the intent of blocking out some of the annoying background noise on the bus ride everyday to work. Space was a premium so noise cancelling and full over the ear headphones were not really an option. The foam pads on the headphones do a good job of reducing background noise. The sound quality is very good and the awful noise of a diesel bus engine is almost unnoticable with the music playing at a moderate level.The fold up style is great for commuters who dont have room in their bag for a big set of head phones and the storage case is great for keeping the cords from getting damaged or the headphones ruined. A definate must buy if you are want isolation from outside noise without the bulk of full over the ear headphones and dont want to drop the cash for noise cancelling that actually works.
2,low cost headphones,"they are comfortable and gives a good range in volume control but they work best with stereo apps where you have access to the equalizer ont he output because the headphone is bias towards bass or lower frequencies. For simple music listening, I would much prefer Sennheiser's PX100 that I also own and provides great sound at a great price. Save your money from getting those Bose sets !Kenny G 2009."
5,Great Travel Headphones,"These are great travel headphones for the money. Compact, comfortable, and they generate a wonderful sound. They even keep most of the outside noise out. For the cost, these are a must have for regular travelers who wish to hear the music (or movie) from the airplane jack. Enjoy.Note: depending on the airline you may need an headphone adapter to plug into the armrest."
2,"Not horrible, very overrated","This is the single most disappointing purchase I've ever made on Amazon (that's thousands of items in 12 years). The sound is mediocre, the construction fragile and, for all but those under 120 lbs., overly petite. None of that bothered me enough to send it back; what bothered me was the strong reviews that hooked me into buying it. I'm dumbfounded. Does Sennheiser rally its employees to write reviews?"
3,Great general headphones that can travel,"I purchased this headphone for use with my Ipod either at work, home or while traveling. Crisp performance and mechanical robustness was my prime criteria. These headphones fit the bill very well. The sound performance is great except for some deficiency in bass. Highs are crisp without being shrill, mid range is clear, and transient performance is excellent (sudden volume changes). I listen to Jazz, Rock, and classical. Those who are into Hip-Hop will be disappointed in the bass performance. They fit snugly to your head, but I can see some thinking the fit is a bit tight. The phones are packaged in a solid travel case that can take a beating and protect your investment. For the money, they are hard to beat."
2,"Great sound, terrible fit","These headphones do sound great, but they hurt my ears! I am a small woman, and my head is not big. These pinch my ears after about fifteen minutes. How do others wear them?"
1,"Poor Sound Quality, But Solved The problem","I have the on-ear open Sennheiser PX100 headphones which have a good sound quality. But, at times I need a closed ear design to help block outside noise. So, I bought the PX200 headphones. The sound coming from this headset is extremely tinny and shallow. I returned them for a refund. If you do not have a good quality headset with you to compare the PX200 to, then you may not realize just how bad the sound really is.However, I discovered that both headsets were exactly the same size. So, I bought the replacement closed ear cushions for the PX200 and put them on my PX100. The ear cushions fit perfectly on the PX100. So, now I can switch cushions depending on my needs. This is a great solution that works great for me and may work out for you."
3,Weight/Performance ratio quite good but.....,"The PX200 is actually quite good for it's weight/performance ratio, the PX250 sounds even better with noice-cancellation although it was quite clumsy with a separate battery module that cannot be detached. I had both and they lasted 2-3 years when both failed at at tension-relief point of the mini-jack, the angled jacks like the ones used by Sony Fontopia series are better. The wire is so thin that repairing is not an option. Until Sennheiser change it's plug design, I will look elsewhere."
5,Most Evil,"Awesome product and shipped fast. I could watch this show over and over again, it is extremly interesting."
5,gret product and transaction,this product is i great i have 3 others in the sweaten to yhe oldies seriers and would recamend then to anyone
4,Well....,"We bought this as a gag gift for our dad. Because of this it is hard for me to give it a real review, but for the reason we bought it it worked perfectly. Provided a laugh for everyone."
4,Sweaten to tthe oldies,Loved this DVD.. doesn't seem like I worked out as long as I did.. It was like dancing my pounds away.
4,Love is the way we walk in gratitude,"Don't be duped by the mind-candy, girly look of this book's cover! Attitudes of Gratitude deserves to be taken seriously by anyone who's serious about the practice of love. It's absolutely impossible to read this book without reflecting on all that you have received from your relationships and from your life experience. This powerful and potent feature makes the book worth buying and reading.MaryJane Ryan also reminds us that gratitude is a simple and effective tool for quickly undoing the false judgments we hold against self and others. This is because gratitude and resentment are mutually exclusive, and each one cancels the other one out. Because gratitude enables you to swiftly change your mind, it's a kind of magic fairy dust that turns you into the person you most want to be. Gratitude is easy. It's fast. And anyone can do it. Try it for yourself and see. (The Spiritual Reviewer)"
4,Fascinating topic,"The title is a bit too vague-- this book is specifically on *Japanese* methods of minimizing clutter, which may or may not be useful to westerners. But what a fascinating topic it is. Only the Japanese could have thought of storing things below the floor, futons that can be rolled up and put away when they aren't in use, ""borrowing the view"" of your neighbour's garden, and so on. The photography isn't dazzling, and many of the homes aren't very stylish, but it's worth reading just to appreciate the ingenious ideas the Japanese have."
3,Good book but with a misleading title,"Overall, Brown does a good job, but he should've titled it, ""Modern Japanese Small Spaces,"" as much of the text explains present day Japanese layout and architecture as an evolution of previous tradition and history. As an example, there's a chapter titled, ""Japanese Housing: Past, Present and Future,"" something the title would have never suggested. More than simply a pretty picture book to put on your coffee table because it truly has well thought out text, the book falls short of being a *true* rehab book, with its lack of a planning section, grid page or index of products, commonly found in the DK books from the UK. In the end, the photography is quite good, and some of the ideas are very stunning in execution."
4,A Great Read,"This book is a terrific source of information that will get you up to speed with CART racing in no time. The content is fairly technical, however, and the author assumes all its readers already know a good deal about cars. It was a bit discouraging to see the author get a bit lazy and pretty much copy entire paragraphs from his other book titled ""Technology of the F1 Car"". That's a big no-no, even if he was plagiarizing from himself! But on the whole, it was a very informative and fun read. Buy it."
2,NOT one of Brown's best early books,"Dani was such a wimpy heroine. It would have been much better if we had known WHY she acted the way she did and then proceed from there. And the way Brown talks about the characters, it sounded more like a 20 year reunion and not a 10 year reunion. I am sorry, but people don't change and accomplish as much as Logan did with as much hinderance as he had to get there, not even if you are driven as he was. I could understand it if it was 20 years later, but 10 years is way too soon. All in all, not a very well written book and definitely not up to her later standards."
4,Sandra Brown's best work,"My school library has a copy of this book. I enjoyed reading it. I also like the characters and plot. And the love scenes, of course, were excellent. This book was just as good as Temptation's Kiss. A must-read for all romance novel readers!"
2,Cheap.,"You get what you pay for. It is very cheap, simple, and weak. It is exactly like the picture. To each there own."
5,his most superior cd. su mejor cd.,"this album is the best ricardo montaner album ever released. this is not an opinion it is a fact. all these songs are some/most of his best works put together and best of all, all songs are completly remastered and sound way more superior to the original recordings. trust me please. for your sake and your ears."
3,Antiquarian Curiosity,This book is a 'novel' biography. It is of historical interest as a victorian translation of a german baroque spiritualist fictional account of the artist.
2,"2.5 stars: Not as good as ""Perfect Victim""","Linda Castillo's characters in ""The Shadow Side"" start off looking like they might be interesting. The classic anti-hero: a cop on disability unsure if trusts his own judgment anymore. The Heroine: a brilliant scientist who has devoted her life to her work because of personal tragedy. Neither are looking for love.But as the book wears on, they stay stagnant and somewhat two-dimensional. I've noticed a lot of repetition when it comes to the thoughts of the characters - especially when it comes to their attraction for one another.Now the plot is somewhat unique and interesting, though the characters themselves seem to drag it down in the prose.If you buy it, get it used. Don't pay full-price"
1,Not ever real Gold,"I bought these hoop earings as a gift and was so embarresed when my girlfriend opened them. They were cheap, flimsy, and obviously not real gold. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY! Thank goodness Amazon is so good about handling returns!"
4,They work,"These are nice and I wear them often, nice size, nice feel. I thought they were a little pricey, reason for 4 stars"
5,must buy!,"I am 5'9 and 136 lb. By no means I can be considered overweight. Except one: my own mind! For 10 years I have been a prisioner of myself. Diets were like cells. I wouldn't allow myself to eat what I considered ""fattening"". When I did, I felt as if I could eat the world, and I actually think I could! I didn't have anyone to talk to because, not being fat, people wouldn't listen! I knew my problem was much more serious than just wanting to be thin. I knew there were some feelings I had to deal with. I just didn't know how to do that... Geneen showed me the way! I am greateful! If you, like me, want to get your life back and put your energy on things other than obsessing about food, this book is a must buy!"
2,"Nice idea, but those are the breaks","Adding pencils to the Twistable trend seemed like a neat idea. But if the ""leads"" breaks in the pencil, they are unusuable because they wiggle back and forth in the plastic holder. And they do break - of our 18, about 4 or 5 are out of commission already. If the leads come out, they can't be used independently because they're too fragile to be held by hand. Too fragile for constructive use. (Amanda's point about their non-biodegradability is well-taken, and rhyming!)"
1,Worst Products,"These are by far the worst products from Crayola. I am so disappointed that Crayola would release such a product that is so substandard in quality. The leads have broken off on several of the pencils & my daughter has not had a chance to enjoy playing with them. As one of the reviewer has accurately stated, once the leads break off, it's unusable! Not worth the money spent. My confidence in Crayola's products has diminished drastically."
4,"Great Collection of a classic interpreter of Eisler, Dessau","Ernst Busch is a singer of the German Left who was associated with avant-garde composers such as Hans Eisler and Paul Dessau, and other exponents of German Expressionist Opera. This CD also contains many songs from the Spanish Civil War which are virtually impossible to find elsewhere. Busch was later captured by the invading Germans while he was in exile and he spent many years in prison until liberated by the advancing Russians. A very good compilation of some little-known modernist music."
1,Doesn't work....don';t buy it!,I purhased this item for my husband to use to charge his shuffle. IT DOES NOT WORK. The connection to the shuffle itself does not work. Save your time and money.
1,Not same one as in picture.,The wall plug is the same but the part that plugs into the ipod is different.They show you this so you believe it will be able to fit into your other shuffles. False advertisement.The thing is so cheap that its not worth returning it.JUst one more item for them to ship out to someone else to write another review.Im gunna break this n take it apart and try to get it to fit in the ipod.
2,craptastic,"I bought this because it was cheap and Prime Available.to start off, Amazon said it was going to be the prime 2 day shipping, took longer than that. After I open up the dented package, the inner box of the DLO PowerBug (DLO) its in preety good shape, and looks like the apple usb to jack connector but once you connect it. . .the shuffle does not seem to recognize any power coming in. the little LED light is neither orange, green, or red.after a while of messing around forcing it to connect to the PC the LED does come on but not 100% guaranteed.The USB to Wall outlet is horrible does not work at all only for a couple of seconds then it goes out.another thing I would like to mention is that the connection end to the Ipod Shuffle is really weird and has like 3 hooks that require the ipod to be forced into it.If I could go back, I would NEVER have purchased it."
1,buyer beware - unreliable,"This product seemed good for my recharging needs. Convenient. After 2 months, however, it would not work. Kaput!! Adding up the postage it costs to send back an item - and to pay for when a new item is shipped back - returning the plug for a different one did not seem worth it. If it was reliable, I'd say go for it. Since it pooped out so quickly after only occasional use, I advise to search for other recharging options."
5,Great coffee every time!,"I spent one frustrating year buying top of the line coffee makers and having something go wrong with them. Not one but TWO Kitchen Aides leaked and malfunctioned. A Cuisinart did not leak, but it didn't turn off, either. You had to pull the plug every time. I cannot function without my morning cuppa Joe and things were getting bad in my houseOne of my sons finally took pity on me (and the rest of the family) and bought this Krups for Christmas. From the first brew it has worked flawlessly --- makes great coffee and keeps it hot in the carafe. Could not ask for more. Programming it is easy, as is the cleanup of the carafe and drip basket.One caveat: if you like boiling hot coffee, this might not suit you. The coffee is at the perfect brewing temperature (in my opinion) but that is NOT boiling. It's just HOT."
3,Uncertain on another purchase,"This would be the second Krups maker we had, our first was a glass Carafe and always leaked when pouring. After that broke we opted for a thermal Carafe type which we had before from Mr. coffee (lasted 10 yrs). We have had this 860 maker about 2 years and have always preheated with hot water and this morning the carafe imploded halfway through the pot as did an acquittances did 3 weeks ago. I am now looking for a SS pot or another coffee maker compared to pots replacement cost."
2,Too watered down,"I prefer my coffee a bit on the strong side. This product creates coffee that tastes too watered down. I initially added four large tablespoons of coffee for 6 cups but was too watery. This is the formula my old Krups uses to create decently strong coffee. I stepped it up to five, and then six tablespoons per six cups of water and couldn't get a strong cup of coffee. The coffee also tastes better from my old Krups. The thermal carafe is great and works extremily well."
4,Katie.com,I really enojoyed this book. It showed me how I need to be carefull when I chat. My mom had already told me not to give out any personal features about my idenity or any information. After i read this book it encouraged me to do other useful things like goin to freinds house or walken the dog just different things to keep me off the internet. When i get on the intetnet im not on for longer then an hour.
3,eh...its pretty good,"I picked up this book at first when I noticed the title. Yeah...I'm a big nerd and do web design and stuff so it interested me. I read the book in about 2 or 3 days. It's a pretty short read, only 120 pages I think. I think it's great she shared her story to other kids. She's willing to admit she made a HUGE mistake ever talking to him online and on the phone. I would have enjoyed it more if it had been written better. It was kind of boring but I think for parents who are paranoid about their kids being attacked by pediphiles (like my mom). All in all, its a good lesson but it could be written a ton better to make the reader a little more interested."
3,Pretty good read - sad story,"Katie did a good job in expressing her feelings; yes, the writing is a little stunted but one should not read this book with a critical editor's eye. If you read it with an open mind and a little bit of sympathy, you'll get a lot out of it. She did a good job of capturing how high school must be for a bunch of kids. Her description of how friends come in and out of your life - what seem like best friends can be scratched out numbers in your address book next week - is also very good.My biggest gripe is the cost - 190 pages of 'quality paperback size'. But I doubt Katie had a lot to do with that part.I am still curious as to why she held affections for her assailant for so long - that is probably the scariest (and least understood) part of the book to me. She does have courage, though."
3,Naive but well-meaning,"From her affluent if somewhat dysfunctional home, Katie finds herself swept up in a Internet romance with a man she agrees to meet which at a swim competition. Needless to say, he was not what she expected and the second part of the book details her attempt to reconstruct her life and rebuilt her relationships. Although it is a little difficult to sympathize with her, Tarbox has a refreshing writing style very representative of her young years, accurately portraying typical teenage self-centeredness and the simplicity with which one naive girl can become a victim."
2,A lot of fuss over nothing,"Firstly, let me put a few things straight that have missed, deliberately or otherwise by other reviewers. 1) She was not thirteenn when she wrote the book, she was 18, 2) she was not raped. I agree, the situation she found herslf, for a 13 year old girl might have been unconfortable, but the entire book builds up to an incident that lasts about a page. I find it rather ironic that a paedophile of 41 is somehow shocking to Miss Tarbox and yet a paedophile of 23 isn't. Like some others have said, the real victims in this story are the sexually abused children that we hear breifly about, the author's experience of a quick kiss and grope hardly seem to measure up."
1,Domain Name Hijacking,The author and publishers used a domain name that doesnt belong to them. (It never has and was easily checked.) The real owner of Katie.com has had her life made miserable by this book.
2,Save your money,Or better yet buy the original British CD. There was only one song on the US version I really liked (Straight to...number one) which is why I gave it a two instead of a one. I love the show but the CD does not do it justice.
4,Some pretty good beats,"I haven't seen Queer as Folk more than a couple times, so really cannot compare the soundtrack to any aspect of the show. However, you don't need a TV to enjoy this music. The soundtrack has quite a number of songs with a good beat to them; I find myself moving along to the music whether it's the focus of my attention, or simple background music while I'm busy on the home PC or working late at the office. Upbeat, and fun!"
4,Great CD!!!,"I love pretty much every song in this CD! I am a fan of both the British and the American versions of Queer As Folk. However, I must say that the American QAF has a better selection of music! Nevertheless, I think they really should have put more songs on the CD, especially ""Forever Young"" by Temperance. Perhaps a 2nd soundtrack is on the way?"
2,I love the show so I bought the soundtrack,"As much as I can scream out Expletives about the GRRRRRREATNESS of QAF the show, the soundtrack falls sadly mediocre. It touts itself as ALMOST LIKE being in BABYLON (a dancejoint that does not exist in real life), well I guess it does in a way, but it doesn't capture the whole feel of BABYLON.I was expecting remixes and stuff! WHERE IS IT?On the whole I guess its an O.K. compilation. A lot of you won't really get what I am saying but, that's okay too. The british soundtrack is actually better."
5,The BEST freshwater fish photo book available.,"I see a lot of reviews about this book. One of the most popular gripes is, ""but there's no text"". Yes, it's true: it's a photo atlas of freshwater aquarium fishes. The most comprehensive I've found anywhere. This book works great for coffee tables, aquarium planning, window shopping, daydreaming, identification of fishes, etc.Most importantly, you know the names of the fishes you are looking at. Once you have the names, you can search for more information on the internet, in other (text) books, in the library, or anyplace else. And besides, can you imagine how big this book would be (and how expensive!) if each photo had a bunch of text with it?"
3,"nice pictures, bad index","Very good pictures, but an index with many failures. Seeking for species on base of the index is complicated.Excessive number of pictures of 'domesticated' species without names."
1,Not a good product.,"I asked specifically for a product that was reusable. This product is not. It was solid and hard the second time I put it back in the freezer. I needed a product that would keep it's ability to ""form"" to the area but this product does NOT do that!!!"
1,Defective on arrival,"Arrived with two different size posts, one too short. Clasp immediately bent out of shape upon attempt to carefully remove it from package. Will send them back, disappointed since sold directly by Amazon."
3,smaller than I thought.,Great shine and well made. I can even sleep in them comfortably which is not the case with most other jewelry.
2,Tiny,"These are pretty earrings and seem to be good quality, but the ball is so tiny you can barely see it. Perhaps is they were shown with another object for comparison."
2,Ok - backs are a bit loose,These earrings arrived quickly and are a good size. They are not too big - I am using them for my second hole. The backs on them are a little loose and bend really easily which makes me a bit scared about losing them. I have been wearing them for a few days and they have been ok so far. Overall the earrings are nice but the cheap backs make them only get 4/5 stars from me.UPDATE: I had to change my review from 4 to 2 stars. After less than a month one of the loose backs fell off and was lost and the earring fell off. Very disappointing.
1,Mouse doesn't work well,Purchased product for a notebook (Dell Inspiron 5100) user but found that the mouse movement was laggy. Downloaded drivers from the Targus website but still had the same problem. Contacted Targus support and they noted that it was because all devices were sharing the same USB connection. I removed the LCD monitor off of the replicator back to the notebook and the mouse now behaves properly. Note: If you are purchasing this replicator to hang a monitor on it beware that there may be some side effects that are very undesireable.
2,A USB hub would work just as well,"I was very disppointed in the video performance of this product. I installed it on my new HP laptop with a 1.6 GHz Centrino Duo processor (which took a phone call to tech support and a download of new drivers) and found that there was a significant delay between what I was doing with the mouse and what I was watching on the screen. The resolution you're able to display on the external monitor is also limited, a fact which would have influenced my purchase. Without video capabilities that actually work, this product is a very expensive USB hub. I'm returning my docking station and using a USB hub. It only adds one more plug (instead of power and docking station I'm plugging in power, USB hub and VGA cable) and works infinitely better."
1,Don't buy this one!,"This version is a poor substitute for the original. The music is there, but the feeling isn't. If you're looking for anything like the original LP, look elsewhere."
5,Buy this for your child,"A superb, haunting, beautiful book. I remember this quite accurately from my childhood. Buy it."
5,Reasonable and Fast,The movie I ordered arrived in a timely manner and was reasonably priced. I will order more movies and CDs in the future.
4,INTERESTING LITTLE FILM EXCELLENT CAST,I watched this movie knowing nothing about it. I found myself very engrossed in the story and the cast was excellent. Ed Norton has played a number of characters who are not what they seem to be. He does an excellent job of selling this would be cowboy's tale.
5,Ross McDonald reincarnate!,"I'll be up-front: I've known Jerry for about a decade now, as a lawyer hiring him to do ""research."" It was his experience as a vice cop and later as a firefighter in San Francisco that forms the basis of his bottomless pool of material. As a fan of the classics in detective novels, from Sayers to James and Poe to -- well -- Kennealy, I find his Nick Polo stories of contemporary California society as compelling, insightful and readable as Ross McDonald's Harper series. Good, quick reads with versimlitude (like that Jerry?), lots of wit and action. In fact, I'm sure I know Polo's landlady!"
5,One of my favorite movies,"Such a wonderful movie, great special effects for the era. Recommend it for all ages."
5,Couldn't of been easier ...,"I don't order with Amazon often, but love-love-LOVE it when they have the products that i'm looking for. I'm a pretty picky shopper, so Amazon makes it so easy and convenient for me to just search, compare, click & go. The sellers are always nice & no hassels are ever involved.Thanx Amazon !"
3,"Good quality, but incorrect gauge size?","I ordered these along with some 12 AWG speaker wires, but even when I used the 10 gauge slot, it cut off a good amount of strands. So, I just had to softly squeeze it and move it around the wire, and then bending the insulation to final breaking point to pull it off. Now, in making my decision to buy these speaker wires, the wire supplier noted that many wires are not true AWG standard, but thinner. So maybe these strippers will work for non-AWG grade. Or, maybe these are made only for solid wire, not strands. In any case, they don't work like they should for me. That said, the wire cutting part is excellent and very sharp. The feel of the tool is good and quality is good."
2,"Good price, so and so performance",It stripped quite a bit of the copper off on 12 gauge speaker wire. I suspected first that the speaker wire was thicker than advertised. But it also stripped copper off 16 gauge wire by different manufacturer. I had to cut half way and then tried to pull the plastic off in order to avoid losing too much copper. My hand was sore afterwards.
4,great tool,i do a lot of home theater installing so i needed a good all in one stripper and cutter. and i was really impressed with the fit and finish of this product. the locking mechanism is smooth and can be operated with a single hand while holding it. i have used it on a number of gauges and brands of wire. all cutting mechanism are very sharp i have yet to try cutting through wire bigger and 10gauage or large solid core wire. so i can not speak to that. but given the chance i would not be afraid to try. i would recommended this tool for any professional or amateur electrician.
4,"""Yuppie Larva""","Learning that ""yuppie larva"" is a term used to describe privileged kids acting snotty was reward enough for me to like this book.While it is true that a few of the categories seem part of common knowledge (see the reader review complaining about the bodybuilder nomenclature), author Reid does a good job putting slang into context and keeping things moving along. It seems to me that most word lovers would enjoy taking a spin through this well-designed book.One more example, from the bicycling chapter: ""FDGB"" is an acronym for ""Fall Down, Go Boom."" *smile*Also recommended:Slang: The Topical Dictionary of Americanisms"
4,Survival Synopsis,Gregory Davenport's book on survival provides an excellent high-level overview of outdoor survival. Though I would not trust my ability to survive having only read this book it gave me an idea of what would be required to not perish in the wilderness. I plan on using the knowledge in this book to play around while I am out camping this summer. This book is great for anyone who likes camping and the outdoors.
4,Explains All,"I've had this product for a couple of weeks. Read it all through and through. The illustrations are easy to comprehend. The way it is written is also simple and detailed. For anynone that is looking for the perfect book in wilderness survival this is it. It would have been nice though to get just a little more of a preview of each section before I purchased it just so I know what I was getting myself into. This is my third survival book that I've gotten off of Amazon.com and this is the only one that is as detailed and thorough on wilderness survival. In the book I like the fact that the author gives you man-made solutions and mother nature solutions. Overall I was pleased with my purchase. I would also check out the Encyclopedia of Wild Edible Plants of North America, I haven't received it yet but from the preview it seems like a thorough book."
2,Very poor quality,"First off I understand this product was only $13.00 and you get what you pay for. Although very short, this is finger joint construction like molding. This is not a single solid piece of wood. The points are obviously not inlays, but paint which is very poorly applied. Spend a few bucks and buy a better quality product."
5,"Mizerak Shorty 40"" Cue","Just as listed and top quality. Needed by smaller players with big aspirations, and they work well for the purpose."
3,Gets the Job Done,"Received the product very promptly and in good condition. The box it was shipped in was really beat up and even creased... but, surprisingly the cue was unharmed. Supplier needs to put a little more effort into packaging. The cue is excellent. Great finish, great feel. I'm having trouble making the tip hold the chalk though. I've sanded the tip several times, but I guess it has too much varnish on the tip I guess? I'm nowhere NEAR being a professional pool player, so maybe I'm not doing something right?... I dunno. Overall, I'm pleased with the product and price. I was VERY pleased with how fast the product was shipped to me.... in time for my July 4th party at my house! =)"
4,More Christmas Gems From Elvis,"""Memories of Christmas"" is a must-have for Elvis Presley collectors because of its previously unreleased material. The unedited ""Merry Christmas Baby"" and a memorable alternate take of ""I'll Be Home On Christmas Day"" justify the purchase. Both 1971 recordings can only be found in this holiday compilation."
1,Ugh,"I bought this perfume as a gift for someone in their late forties, and it smelled terrible to them and myself. I thought this perfume would be really good for a mature gift for a woman, but I had no idea it should have been for an older woman in her sixties. I saw all of the good feedback, but in the end it was a major disappointment for a Christmas gift."
1,Vanderbilt Body Mist,Waste of money - not the Vanderbilt light spray cologne/body mist I desired. Very disappointed. What happened to the 'good stuff'??
1,Does not work!!!,"I bought 4 bottles of this product. On receipt, we found three of four bottles were defective. BEWARE!DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT! THE SPRAY NOZZLES ARE DEFECTIVE!!!"
3,I had to pull out the toothpicks a couple of times...,to hold my eyelids open. I am a fast reader so saying I read it in 24 hours means nothing. The best part of the book was the way he tied the mother's past with her daughter's. I liked the message in the book and all the characters were great and developed really well. I could visualize everything in the book and was satisfied with the ending.
4,Awesome read!,"I love a good page turner. Exciting, enticing, and keeps you wondering what's going to happen next. A couple of typos and misspelled words, but overall the characters came to life in a vivid way. The growth and personal development of each was also nice to read. Finished it in 3 days! 4 stars."
5,The Preacher's Son,I really enjoyed this book. This book was written in away that you can relate to the characters. I judge a book by the first five chapters and the last two. I had to read the entire book because it was written well .
4,Nice,"Here in Brazil I liked to watch this show on my teens, the idea rocks and even inspired another famous production (Galaxy Rangers). The only thing I disgusted was the lack of the original japanese audio. The series has only the english-dubbed option. But like many other animes of that decade.It' s still a very nice show."
2,Tiring,"I thought I would enjoy this CD more than I have. Turns out Mr. Mister only had a couple good songs.Since a while back my kids were always quoting a song on the radio that went ""Hey soul sister... listening to Mr. Mister on the radio..."" I thought I like them to hear Mr. Mister. I can hardly listen to this CD all the way through.Zebra, Nelson and Mr. Big are all artists from ""back in the day"" I enjoy listening to a whole lot more."
3,It's ok...,"The only songs I knew were Kyrie Eleison and Broken Wings. The rest of the songs weren't as good I thought, but I bought it for those 2 songs so it was ok."
4,The Rebel Witch,A childrens fiction about a young witch and her adventerous nature. Living with her aunt(a wise witch)you read how trial and error learning can turn into a adventure to save the world as we know it. This book lets your imagination run wild with the concept of magic. A great book for a young reader.
3,Meh.,"I loved the comedic self-deprivation the main character gave us, but overall, I felt there were a lot of loose ends and I'm still not sure where the climax of the story was. It was an okay read but considering I usually inhale my books and it took me a month to finish it, I'm only giving it three stars."
3,Cute book,"Was looking for a quick, cute read. This fit the bill. The lead character is charming, not the typical bitter woman. Funny and clever."
4,A Good Beach Bag Book,"""Must Love Dogs"" is fun and light -- perfect to toss in your tote for a quiet read on the beach. The main character, Sarah Hurlihy, is a forty-something pre-school teacher who decides to drag herself out of her post-divorce depression and ""get back out there."" What Sarah finds ""out there"" is enough comic relief to fuel her through one disasterous encounter after another. With her large and colorful family trooping in and out of her life at inopportune times with troubles and demands of their own Sarah's challenges are huge and her privacy non-existant. Every failed encounter, foible and mis-step is grist for the family rumor mill. I thought the main character's sadness over the end of her marriage was very sensitively woven into the story and gave a nice counterpoint to the spirit and determination she showed to rediscover herself and find a new life and a new love. Nice and light -- an average reader could read this book start to finish in an afternoon or two."
3,Patti Linnell got it covered; no need to reinvent the wheel.,"Patti Linnell did such a nice job reviewing this book that I don't have much too add. This is not a boring look, the writing is fun and entertaining and occasionally even hilarious. The ending is weird and sort of unsatisfying, but I'm one who likes the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. In spite of the chuckles and the strong characters (some, like Dottie, were over the top), it was a pleasant read, not memorable, so I'm going to have to go with 3.I rate books as follows:***** Fun and meaningful book, or changed/challenged me in a positive way.****Really fun or meaningful; well worth the time.***Pleasantly skimmed the surface; not memorable.**Plodded through.*Abandoned; very flawed."
2,"I love dogs, but not this book!","This book is about a divorced woman named Sarah and her quest for love. She places a classified ad, plus has a couple of other love interests.I didn't like this book. The characters were so underdeveloped that you don't know enough about them to care who Sarah chooses at the end. The author never explains why the main character does some of the things she does. There are some subplots, but the only one that affects Sarah is the one with her brother. The others just seemed like filler to me."
1,This book is so boring...,"I love chick lit as much as the next chick, but this book is just so extrodinarily averge I gave up about a third of the way through. Read something by Anita Shreve or Marian Keyes instead."
1,Movie is way better,I was very disappointed in this book. I thought for sure the book would be better then the movie in this case that just isn't true. I wasn't sure how to take the ending. I really thought my kindle didn't download the entire boom because I thought for sure that a book couldn't end the way it did but low and behold it did...very very disappointing!!!
4,New twist for animal lovers,"This book was an easy, light read that combined a nice story with some reality issues of today. With broken marriages on the rise one wonders how many people this story relates to. I didn't see the movie of this but the story is not deep or complicated to understand. Good read for traveling."
3,What are the tracks?,"I don't know the extra tracks. I have heard the Guns of Love Disastrous, and the Ethers tragic. They are basically erie instrumentals of the Beginning is the End is the Beginning, which is a spooky remix of ""The End..."". I also know Fluke did a remix of this song but I don't know if it is on this CD. I love Fluke and would love to hear that remix."
2,"Dated, Tiresome musical","This Birdie did not age well. The story is so dopey, the teenagers so gagaliciously 1950ish (""getting pinned"" is the source of a major number and integral to the plot), the parents so repulsive and/or outlandish, that it is a wonder anyone would bother putting it out on DVD. Unlike Grease, or Oklahoma, or any other musical I can think of, Birdie has no ""larger"" coherent message that translates through the anachronistic setting. And, purely as a musical, it is weak. With one or two exceptions, the songs are not well constructed and the choreography is unimaginative. The one redeeming feature is the very young and gorgeous Ann-Margaret. She is truly luminous, charismatic and talented, and the movie falters whenever she's not on screen.For real lovers of the genre only, otherwise, it's a very fast way to clear a room."
4,"""What's the Matter with Kids Today?""","Conrad Birdie (Jesse Pearson), a famous self-centered rock and roll star is about to be drafted into the military (shades of Elvis.) A plot/plan to make several people happy and rich is to have Conrad bestow ""One Last Kiss"" on a randomly chosen young lady from his fan club. The lucky girl is Kim McAfee (Ann-Margret) much to the consternation of her steady boyfriend. This will be done on the Ed Sullivan Show. Many other lives and fortunes revolve around this plan.Much more entertaining than the story is the interaction of the characters and this is a musical.From play to stage this was well done. Dick Vandyke however though this was just vehicle for Ann Margaret. I look on it as the measuring stick by which all other versions, stage or movie are gauged by. I find my self singing many of the songs.The Villain"
4,GREAT FUN ALL THE WAY,"Superb version of the Broadway musical about rock and roll superstar about to join the army. The movie centers on his visit to a small town so one of his fans can give him ""one last kiss"" on national television.Great musical numbers, great fun all the way. Paul Lynde really knew how to be funny. If only the General had allowed Elvis to be in this movie! If you haven't seen it, get it. It's great entertainment for the entire family."
3,movie is stupid but the play we are doin is awesum,We are doing this play in school. Its so cool. We are going to be so good fri sat and sun the movies stupid cuz they take out english teacher and american boy here is 1 of the songsWe luv u conrad o yes we do weluv u conrad and we'll be true when ur not near us we're blue oh conrad we luv u
1,worst musical EVER!!,"I love many of the actors in this musical, BUT HATE the musical.....worst I have ever seen......my basic statement can be summed up in one word.....YAWN!!"
2,They call this compact?,"I would have thought ""compact"" would have meant that it would take up less space on my tiny counter, but that's not the case. I could have bought a less expensive model and had a smaller, sturdier device. Worse, I've yet to have an English muffin or piece of toast that turned out evenly toasted. One side of the item gets very dark, the other side is light. And if you are toasting items that are smaller (like an English muffin), they are so low down in the unit that you will need something other than your fingers to pull them out with (or risk burning yourself like I've done.) Disappointing."
5,Poetic Justice,What a triump for the soul! I keep reading it over and over again. This author knows exactly how to feed a soul and give you what you need the most to feed that hunger. A lightbulb went off in my head when I read the pages. I have encouraged all of my friends to go out and get this excellent book. Secrets of My Soul is a triump for the soul!
5,One Incredible Experience!!!,"And that's exactly what Latorial Faison has given in ""Secrets Of My Soul""--- not mere words--- but an incredible experience!When I began reading the collection, I expected to finish in one sitting. Instead, I was pleasantly surprised to discover that I was limiting myself to 3-5 poems per night. Once submerged in the chambers of her heart, I clearly needed the extra time to bathe in her simple wisdoms and ponder each lesson shared.As a fellow writer, I extend my deepest gratitude and admiration to Ms. Faison for unlocking the door to her soul and permitting entrance to those who dare to steal a peek.Her work, in retrospect, is no less than heavenly!"
3,Great for the price,It is good but starting to fray all ready. Great for the price. Would have liked more color options to choose from.
4,Does the job,"It does what it claims. Can't vouch for the included paint, as I used a more expensive glow-in-the-dark paint. Light beams from device onto ceiling are very faint and difficult to see when painting."
3,Fairly entertaining East Side Kids Film,"This is one of the Monogram cheapies that the kids so frequently did but it's not bad. Typical of their films of the 40's, a little grittier and more dramatic and less slapstick than they would become in the 1950's. In this one the kids are convicted of stealing a truck and sent to the Wilton Reform school. There they learn that Danny's brother has been sentenced to be executed for a murder he did not commit. The Kids now have to bust out of the reform school and capture the real murderer to save bill.As noted this early Kids film is a much crime drama as it is comedy but the comedy bits are funny and the dramatic parts done as well as any B movie of the day. Well acted compared to many Monogram pictures and the film looks good, too. The reform school guards are you typical uncaring fellows who don't believe anything the kids say.Well done Kids movie."
2,East Side Kids back in reform school. Gabe Dell joins cast.,"Now that the East Side Kids (Leo Gorcey, Bobby Jordan, Huntz Hall, Sammy Morrison) are done chasing spooks (SPOOKS RUN WILD [1941]), they get silly talking to mannequins. Someone escapes from prison on Blackwell's Island, so the boys go to investigate at the dock on West St. The police think the prisoner has drowned, but has not. By stealing a truck they helped the convict. The kids end up in reform school (again). Danny's (Bobby Jordan) brother, Bill, is wrongfully accused of murder. The real murderer is the same convict that got the boys in reform school. Within two days, the kids must break-out of reform school to save the life of Danny's brother before he is executed. Ann Doran is in this one and Bobby Stone too. Gabriel Dell who was over with Billy Halop, Huntz Hall and Bernard Punsly helping the Little Tough Guys joins the East Side Kids films too. The next film in the series: LET'S GET TOUGH! (1942)."
1,Gina G Disliker From F.L. Dont waste your money on this sh.t,SHE IS DISGUSTING AND A WOMAN FROM HELL. IM WARNING YOU NOT TO BUY THIS SH.T. I MEAN IT. SHE IS SO GAY
3,"As an intro text, this is one of the better ones...",I have been using this text as a teacher for several years (through three editions). It is accessible and easy to use. The only complaint I have is that the editions change too frequently and the information contained is pretty much the same. There are better texts but this one is widely used and a good buy.
1,Nice Product; Poor Shipping,"I liked the idea of this item, but it arrived in poor condition, with one side cracked. I see from the reviews that I am not the only person who has had this problem. How disappointing!"
1,Don't Buy! Cheap does not pay!,First of all I would give it zero stars if possible. This is the worst thing we have ever bought. Our first cup was fine. It started leaking right after that. Now it won't even brew the expresso. It is leaking down the sides. Spend the money on a good machine. And yes we got two sets of expresso grounded very fine at Starbucks and it still does not work.
1,Only lasted for 5 months,"I had my first machine for 5 months - a gift from a friend. When it started to let steam out all over the place, I went out and bought another one. I thought I was just unlucky with the first one. It also only lasted 5 months like the first one. I cleaned it - vinegar etc... like the instructions said - no luck. Steam came from everywhere. It would not warm the milk anymore. I took it back. Never again."
4,One-Stop Shopping,"OK--there are some classic cuts missing, but this is a great CD to get the ball rolling for those who want to upgrade from vinyl and cassette. The sonic quality can't be beat, and though the songs from the 2nd disc are probably less familiar/interesting to those who like the first 25 tracks, there are some noteworthy inclusions, such as ""Mr. Pleasant,"" ""Celluloid Heroes,"" and a great companion piece to ""Sunny Afternoon"" called ""Afternoon Tea.""Only one gripe--how could they have left off ""Stop Your Sobbing,"" which appears on the less-well-mastered Rhino CD? With ""Sobbing,"" and perhaps ""Who'll Be the Next in Line,"" this would have been one of the best rock CD collections of all time. It's good enough for most of us, though, and we can fill in the blanks with the original LP/CDs when necessary."
3,used CD,"the price is a little high for a used CD, the media didn't show any scratch but the case is another history. like title describe.."
1,Wish I Could Send It Back,"After giving this CD a fair chance, I can understand why there are so many used copies up for sale. I'll be adding mine tonight. Weak, Bland and Totally Uninspiring."
3,Too Much of a Good Thing,"What starts out as a promising experience on disc one with ""Not Seventeen"" and ""Beautiful"", wears thin by the end of the second (overmixed) remix disc. Mandalay's ""Solace"" is largely derivative of many better acts that have come before then. Mono comes to mind, and the lesser known but brilliant Waterlillies whose CD ""Tempted"" stands alone in the genre of etheral dance pop. This is not to totally dismiss Mandalay by any strech, they do a good homage to lady Madonna with ""This Life"" and work hard to keep the rest clean and accessible. Good stuff."
2,"Audio editing adds ""whistling"" noises","Has anyone else experienced this? I have numerous audio recordings on tape that I'm trying to transfer to CD. If I attempt to do more than adding track marks and fading in/out at either end of the entire CD's recording, each track ""gains"" a layer of whistling or other distorted noises. The results remind me of listening to old audio cassettes on those old portable desktop cassette players (as in the 1970s and early 1980s). Since most of what I want to do with a product such as Nero is editing audio-only material, I can't say that I'm satisfied with this software. I will not be purchasing Nero 7 because of this."
4,chunky nu teq-ish sounds,"tsuyoshi's tribute to the coming of age of GOA. this is an attempt to pre-empt the nu sound of trance with more contempory sounds and a hurdy-gurdy of urban eclecticism. watch and listen to welcome to the world, agreat interpretation of the artform"
3,not exactly what I wanted,"I'm a student and tried to avoid any instructors edition of the book. I was relaxed when the seller responded to me email quickly. However, The book that made it to my home was an instructor's edition, whick the seller didn't indicate on Amazon site. Although my teacher didn't ask me to replace the book with a student's edition, he gave me many unhappy looks since I've been using the book."
5,A Great Accomplishment,"Although I'm not an expert in folk music, I believe this album to be a real treasure - Ariane's vocals and her accomplished instrumental ability fuse together to create complex, inspiring music; not simply ethereal but powerful and moving. Get this album - I'm sure you'll find at least one song on this album that you'll love."
4,Vegas Elvis,This is his second live album. The songs are just like on In Person compiled from different concerts. I don't know why should we listen to Release Me or Del Shannon's Runaway or The Beatles' Yesterday when the originals are so much better. C.C. Rider is here issued for the first time. The songs are performed very well and Elvis is singin' great.The one thing I really don't like on this album is that it is too short. I Think RCA should release it as a double album or on two on one cd with album In Person. After all the songs are from the same concerts.
1,Amazon what gives????,"Why would Amazon want me to review an order that they didn't fill? I would LOVE to review this item - how can I get it????I've been waiting since December for it, and was told last week, the back order will not be filled."
4,Mark II Live on Stage a Great Recording,"This is a three cd set recorded live at Knebworth in 1985, and Stockholm in 1970. The stuff from 85 sounds like the Nobody's Perfect album, but Gillan sounds 10 times better. Sound quality is great except for a bit of delay and slap back. The material from Stockholm is amazing, an outstanding live recording of Child in Time, when Ian Gillan still had his incredible vocal tone. Highly recommended for the Ian Gillan or Deep Purple fanatic."
1,Waste of money,"I don't like to say bad things about books, but it was a real waste of money to buy this book.First of all, the software included with the book is not reliable, and crashes. The author is not direct and to the point... I recommend C++ The Complete Reference - Osborne if you are a beginner, know nothing about C++ and are looking for a good start."
4,Excellent and enjoyable straight-ahead jazz,I was made aware of this album through an interview with Ralph in Saxophone Journal. This is excellent ensemble jazz - you won't be disappointed.
2,"Great shot of espresso, but poor frothing","I got this machine about six months ago and loved it the first time I used it. As it turns out, I've had a lot of problems with the auto-cappuccino accessory and frothing the milk. I don't get the nice HOT, frothy, steamed milk. I get only warm milk with foam on top no matter what setting I am using. I've also tried the steam nozzle on the milk (which is supposed to be used for steaming items such as soup) and have had little success with that as well. I have tried the suggestions in the owner's manual for the problems I'm having with always getting warm milk instead of hot, steamed milk, but have had no success. Don't waste your money on this machine unless all you want is a great shot of espresso. In that department, this machine is wonderful. Otherwise, forget it. For the money, there has to be something better out there."
4,Cool CD!,"This is a REALLY GREAT cd!!!! But it wouldn't be my fave cd,because this music on this album is not really a kind of music I like.But I LOVE Bizonce!!!Who ever likes R'N'B groove will love this album and this single Bizonce!!!"
2,INTERESTING OLiViA HAS THE BALLS...,...im suprised she had the guts [ and the balls] to come out with a solo c.d.. BECAUSE SHE HAS BALLS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! GOOD JOB..THE SONGS NEED HELP THOUGH.. such as include biggie. [even though hes dead its okay]--GOOD JOB!--
1,WHAT ON EARTH???,"UmmmFirst Lady??? of G-Unit.She looks Like a Man. For real, Just looking at her face on that album cover? Are you seriously telling me that a woman?NO WAY. Im not falling for the tranny surpise."
1,Oh C'mon,What's with all of the good reviews? You all know that this girl didn't get a record dieal because of her singing talent. It's because she fits todays image of black girls with white features and caramel colored skin. Be foreal.
5,Gotta love it!,"Burnout Revenge is one of the most fun driving games period.I love that I can drive 200+ mph and slam into cars sending them flying while you're able to keep driving!How fun is that?!Just don't hit the oncoming traffic!Bottom line it's fun, and a must have for your collection if you like driving games."
4,Burnout Revenge,"Even though Burnout Revenge is a first generation XBox 360 game, it is loads of fun. The gamer does not need simulation driving skills. It is simply meant to be fun and the music is great. Visually, it takes some getting used to the harsh contrast incorporated into the game. It must have been intentional, though. The bright sunlight in your eyes contrasted by the dark shadows on the road, add a level of difficulty without slowing down the gaming experience."
3,Mechanical fault,"I gave these earrings as a gift and they were very well received. My owl very much likes the smooth, shiny appearance.Problem: the tiny metal piece that holds the earring onto the ear is too loose. I refer to the bit of metal that looks (approximately) like the number ""8.""I would return the earrings, but my owl is already attached to them. Probably because they resemble owl eggs.At this price I don't expect diamonds and rubies, but I do expect the earring to stay securely on the ear. It is only a matter of time before one of the ""8"" shaped pieces of metal falls off, and then an earring will be lost."
2,disapointing !,"I was so happy with these earings until I wore them. The backs provided did not lock. I tried them on once, and the backs simply fell off. i managed to save both earings, and tried to find some ohter backings that would hold the earings in. Unfortuantely, this did not work, and the second time I wore them , I lost an earing. Perhaps the posts themselves were somehow wrong? I don't know."
4,cuuuuuuuuuuute,"those earrings are sooooooo cute, when i first saw them i thought they were really tiny, but when i put them on they were just perfect ^_^, not too big not too small...i recommend it to everyone"
1,I have never received it from the seller. Seller Sucks!!!!!!! I contacted once and never received a reply.,I still have yet to receive this book. I have contacted the seller via email before July 31st. I ordered the product at the end of June. I never received a reply. Luckily it was only $7.95 or so with the shipping. Don't use this seller!
5,CroCop at his Best,"I've been a fan of MMA for years now and I can honestly say that this is one of the top two or three events I've seen.The Cro Cop vs. Wanderlei Silva fight was one of the most brutal beatdowns I've seen in such a high profile match.The Alexs Emelianenko vs. Sergei Kharitonov fight was good with a great finish.Also the Shogun Rua vs. Cyrille ""The Snake"" Diabate fight was very entertaining.Shogun was getting beaten standing up, but when he took The Snake down it was over shortly after.I'm not sure how much Zuffa will edit this DVD from the original PPV broadcast I saw because the pre-fight show and fighter introductions were great as were the in ring entrances, but if you're an MMA fan and have purchased events on DVD in the past this would be one that I highly recommend buying."
1,Will you REALLY use this?,Overpriced diary with very little training information. There is very little room to write
2,"Good product, when it worked...","This is a good blender. Has nice features, it's easy to use, love the controls and the crystal container. Very easy to clean also. Quiet and powerful. The problem is that it wasn't made to last very long. After a year of use the gear just gave up. I turned it on and the crusher didn't spin any more. For the price you should get a better, longer lasting product. I wouldn't recommend it."
1,junk,junk that says it all but all of ea launch titles were i think they should've refunded our money for these launch titles but thats why they went from first to third. they still are doing this just look at dragon age:origins another unfinished game
1,A giant step backwards,"How disappointing... What a beautifully polished turd.Why is there even a franchise mode??, they cut so much from it that its just a shell of its former self... I'll put it this way, there are so many flaws, and it is so unbalanced and clunky (gameplay wise), that ESPN football from last year was more enjoyable than this.all this game does is look good. The low point of my favorite series ever."
2,RUSHED TO MARKET TOO SOON,"If the gameplay was as detailed as the PS2 version, this game would have rocked. The graphics are superior. They really dropped the ball of gamming options....some of the key things missing was no Superstar mode. You can't build and devolpe you own player for a career. No challenge of plays. I am sure there are several other things missing, after playing it about 4 or 5 times, I quit playing because it was no fun. I hope the 2007 edition will be better. Re-wrap it and give to someone as a present."
4,Fun and comfortable,"Bought for my girl, and we love it. Can use as pillow ease your sleep!!! Though I don't like van Ludwig model, but the product is very good."
3,Fantastic possibilities,"Having 2 of these by this point, i have to say to kidults and tool inclined teens this is the best direct plunger modded platform of the original nerf lineup. The power and ranges you can get from a properly done and tuned longshot can touch anything before the elite series. Add to that a lsfg integration and you have a powerhouse for whatever your game of choice may be.However, it does tend to strip darts if you dont cycle it properly which will lead to jams. On top of that stock performance is maybe 20 feet if your lucky.and now these being so rare, i would never spend more then 30 dollars on one. The newer elite series far outclasses this blaster, and as good as the tech inside this one is, its not 300 dollars worthy."
2,not impressed,"First off, this is the only toy that my son wanted for this birthday...im sure what i recieved will serfice, but i am not impressed...80$ for a USED toy that looks like its been beat to hell at the bottom of a toy box, when it was suppose to be in very good condition, like new with out the original box. It doesnt look like the gun in the picture! If it didn't say long shot cs-6 on the gun itself i would have said i was sent the wrong toy!!"
3,Not as great as it looks,The Nerf N-Strike Longshot is Durable and easy to put together.It would of been nice to know the small gun that attaches only shoots one shot at a time.the long shot will jam if you try to shot to fast in a battle.Over all I think the price is a little high for all the better it shootsI bought 2 for my grandsons and the small Nerf guns they got were more accurate then the long shot
3,Jams easily.,The darts get jammed too easily. Does not have the distance I thought it would have. A little disappointed.
1,Nerf Longshot,"The Longshot is broken already, it will not fire, it was not working by 12/28. The removable pistol section wouldn't fire from the get-go. My son is not particularly tough on toys, and didn't do anything extreme with this one--I'm very disappointed."
3,Pricing,"I thought I had purchased 2 of the Nerf Strike Longshot CS-6 guns for my nephews for Christmas. It turns out only one was ordered. Ok, BUT I paid $25.99 and free shipping on December 1. Now they are asking DOUBLE the original price. That is Robbery!! To add to that, the shipping is about $10.00. I am really very disappointed in what Amazon has become. I used to do all my shopping through them. This will not happen next year. Be very, very careful when you order. You will end up paying way too much for your purchase."
2,"More like, Long---- *cough* *cough*. You know.","From my son: Monkey see, monkey want. I got the Longshot for Christmas '06. The moral of the story is: don't believe everything you see in a commercial. It showed great accuracy; what a joke. And the commercial claim, ""Everything you need to blast your skills to the next level."" should have been, ""Everything you need to spend $30.00 on, to ruin your kid's Christmas (or any child's birthday.""). Bottom line: this gun stinks, and I would DEFINITELY NOT recommend this toy. To ANYONE."
2,watch out!!!!!!!!!!!!! (please),"hey, i know that no one likes the bad reviews, so I'm sorry about this, but I just have to say the straight up facts. this gun is good for aboout two hours, then it starts to jam, and badly. I mean, I don't mind if guns jam all that much, but it was pathetic. I love nerf, but this gun jams too much for your trouble. if you want a good gun then get the vulcan. it's cooler, and it's just awesome. this gun is truly, well, crap, no offense to all that like it, but, it's just extreemley breakable."
2,"Lame, jams, and disappointing","My son HATED this gun, and we have nearly every one. The longshot is so disappointing. Jams constantly, slow mechanism, heavy for the weak shots u get. Inconsistent shots. The pathetic front gun handle snaps off all the time, who designed this crap? We ended up keeping the stampede instead. I think that all the glowing reviews here are probably fake. I read them and based my decision on those. If you get this gun, you too will be adding your poor review. The longshot has less power than the stampede, the hyperfire, even the nite finder has more power and distance. It's not so much the weak fire, it's the variable firing and accuracy. We ended up ripping off that stupid front gun, taking off the barrel, which just retards any power, taking off the stand ( too heavy), and trimming off all excess plastic crap that this gun has. Now a decent gun that jams only now 60% of the time. Avoid this dog of a nerf."
5,Nerf Longshot CS-6,"I got this gun today,so this might noy be the best review. The nerf longshot CS-6 is a great edition the n-strike line. On Amazon it's $[...] for the yellow version and $[...] for the blue version. I got the yellow version because it looks cool.good features: -has a built-in stand for sniping-has a mini pistol on the barrel-sight also for sniping-stock doesn't come off, but is extendable and can hold an extra clip.bad features: I haven't found any yet."
5,GREAT FOLLOW-UP TO THE FIRST,"Even though i have enjoyed Caliban Cove, i was dissapointed by the lack of killings and descriptions in the story.Its has a great follow-up to the first book, (The Umbrella Conspiracy), what happened in the following weeks, yet it lacks the same great detail and descriptive work as in the first. It has a great plot and story but not so good detail,its funnier this time with a little more sex jokes and has more of the ""SH*T"" word. It is a definite buy to Resident Evil Lovers."
4,The first original Resident Evil novel,"Caliban Cove is the second installment in the Resident Evil novelization series and the first original work of the series written by S.D. Perry. After the events of Umbrella Conspiracy, Caliban Cove serves as an interlude between the events of Umbrella Conspiracy and City of the Dead, with Rebecca Chambers (one of the survivors of Umbrella Conspiracy) teaming up with fellow S.T.A.R.S. operatives and infiltrating a lighthouse base where more grotesque Umbrella experiments are being conducted. Naturally, everything goes wrong, people die, and blood runs like water. Caliban Cove has it's share of unexpected twists and turns, but it just isn't as compelling as the previous and proceeding novels. Although this isn't the worst in Perry's series of novelizations (that would belong to Underworld), don't walk into this one with too high expectations."
3,3 and 1/2 stars --------------*** 1/2,"Perry's ALL-ORIGINAL RE novel CALIBAN COVE is a marked improvement upon the sterile UMBRELLA CONSPIRACY. This is because it is ALL-ORIGINAL. Perry is able to excercise some free will about what she thinks about the Resident Evil thing. There is less mindless zombie action and some more character interaction. The dialogue possesses a little bit more flair. But this book brings out something that had annoyed me from the first book and continues to annoy me in later books. When inside a characters head, every few lines or pages there is something to this affectHe/She pushed the thought from his/her mind. I can't tell you how much ""pushing away "" of thoughts there is in this book, and there is simply an overload of personal conflict that is too heavy-handed to be intriguing. Once again,I credit Perry's overwhelmingly rich descriptions on blood and gore."
5,"You're a mean one, Mr. Gill","You're a mean one MR. Gill. You're slimy and filthy and ill. You're as rotten as green cheese, with a meanness hard to ease. Mr. Giiiiiiiill. I wouldn't touch you with a 500 feet pole! You're a hairy and smelly, just like the elephant nelly You are a frog, a toad, with only one mode Mr. Giiiiiiiill. You are ugly and poopy, with a mood that's moopy You love your afro, with the shampoo Pamfro. Mr. Giiiiiiiill."
3,The most boring book in the series,Unlike RE1 the book got exciting about 150 pages through. The enemies were about a couple of zombies with guns and a monster in the cove. The enemies were the Dullest in the series. Only reson I gave it a okay reveiw is that it has more suspense then the first book.
1,Don't waste your time or money!!!!,I love the game but hate the books!!!! Until they get a writer with talent..Avoid this!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2,OK for beginners,"I am a 14 year old boy taking a college course on C. I already had a fairly strong C background. Frankly, I was rather disapointed. The book is incredibly easy, and instead of offering established functions (like atoi) they make new functions to do the same thing. Overall, I guess it's ok for beginners, but this was my text book for a colloge course, come on guys, lets get a little more advanced here."
3,carafe,"I like the looks of this and the ease of cleaning the carafe.I use a small coffeemaker for daily use for myself and use this coffeemaker for my gatherings. My only problem was that after 5 uses with my first carafe(not many coffee drinkers at my get-togethers),the handle just gave way while I was carrying it to the table!!Instead of throwing out the entire coffeemaker and having to buy a new one(just out of warranty) I decided to try again(cautiously). It does keep the coffee hot as long as you turn the top closed and remove it from the ""maker"".That is an important step!"
3,Handle broke,"We keep the coffee pot next to the stove, so the handle melted a bit. That was my bad... But then it broke off. That's just annoying.And another thing, while I'm ranting, it's kinda hard to screw the top into the pot straight! Nothing like struggling with your coffee pot first thing in the morning...But I'm buying a new carafe, rather than replacing the whole thing, because we do generally like this coffee maker."
2,Can't really tell a difference,I don't see where this did anything for my wheat bread. No difference. Maybe the stuff was old when I received it. I'm not sure.
4,Cheap!!,The price is very good. The only thing i am not satisfied is they will be expired in one year. Not the new products.
5,Poems Prayers and Promises saved my life,Many years ago I was at a very low point in my life..contemplating suicide...I had a weapon and laid down on the bed..for some reason I turned the clock radio on...this song by John Denver Poems Prayers and Promises started playing....I didnt want to die anymore. It truely saved my life.
2,Only one tune,Ordered for my wife; she only likes one tune! Shipping was awesome. No reflection on the sender!
3,Ehhh...Its Ok,"I was looking for a neat way to stow the trash in my car, which usually isn't any more than receipts, tissues, or an occasional soda bottle. The size is just right, fits perfectly right behind the center console of my Toyota Highlander. I love that the weight bag is included and it really prevents the bag from tipping over when I make a turn. However, I gave it 4 stars because the velcro isnt very ""sticky"" on either the lid or underneath the bag. I'm glad it doesnt tear up the carpet when I pick it up, but I feel that it can be a little more secure.*UPDATE*Ive barely had the bag about a month now and yesterday I noticed that the wire that runs along the top and keeps the bag open has poked through the fabric. By no means did I put this bag through unnecessary wear and tear. I'm the only one that is ever in the car. Really disappointed, will have to sew it up :/"
5,One of Sondheims Best!!!,Sondheim gives us a musical thrill as he gives us a window through which we can explore the artist and his work. This show is truly amazing and has been highly overlooked. It is definatly a winner in my book!
5,A Classic in the Hammond B-3 Jazz Arena,"This album features Melvin Rhyne with Joshua Redman, Peter Bernstein, and Kenny Washington. This line up should say it all, but this is just the swingingest B-3 group since Jimmy Smith's groups or Wes Montgomery's groups.I have not always been a big fan of the Hammond B-3 sound. I preferred my jazz to be acoustic, but listening to Jimmy Smith and Melvin Rhyne opened this door for me. Now I listen to alot of B-3 combos.The first song Hattush's Blues is a killer. The recording quality is excellent on Criss-Cross records is always good. By with confidence, buy with joy."
5,Just as I remember it.,"My mother and I listened (and sang along) to this seletion on 8 track tape when I was a little girl, over and over again. I loved it then, and I love it now. Some of these songs have been changed in more recent recordings, and some of the songs can't be found on other Dolly CDs. That is why I am glad I bought this CD."
5,John's Greatest moment,"This album is the best,from John's version of Paradise to Rocky Mountain High.....Just listen"
3,not too good,"I'm sorry to say that I didn't enjoy this book. It was extremely repeptitive... telling us again and again how the mother left. This got kind of irritation considering you were reading the same thing over and over again with different wording. It was alright in some parts though... I do have to say. But it was definitely not a wonderful book. Okay, I guess. If I were to have rated this book without reading the ending it may have been a higher rating but the ending made it absolutely idiotic. It made not sense whatesover. If you are really into poetry and stuff you may like it a little more than I did... but not to much more. It uses a lot of subliminal meanings and metaphors and stuff. So, whatever. Read if you want, but most likely your wasting your time."
5,It's Deja Vu All Over Again,"It's too bad this book is out of print because it's a tale relevant to the current British Royal Family. Richard Hough wrote this easy-to-read book on the six children of King George V and Queen Mary out of the notes he took for his books on the Mountbatten family. King George (and Prince Philip) was a rigid martinet who could only criticize his children so they grew up to fear him. George (and Prince Philip) adored his daughter Mary (Princess Anne) who grew up self-righteous. Queen Mary (Queen Elizabeth II) was not a warm and loving mother. She put her duty to the monarchy above her duties as a mother and neglected her children. Her eldest son Edward VIII (Prince Charles) sought love with a married woman who became a mother-figure for him, a necessary balm for his immaturities. Her son George was the Randy Andy of his era and a bisexual (Prince Edward), too. Among the Windsors, it can be said that history truly repeats itself."
5,Wonderful combo of gothic and post gold rush California,"Told in traditional gothic's heroine's first person voice, this is a very good example of Norton's world building even when that world is the straitlaced world of high Victorian America. Both coasts are covered but it centers on San Francisco. Very good detail on period settings and clothing while holding to a very realistic appraisal of the rigid morals and confines for women ot that time. The heroine does it all but the hero does make a proper entrance from time to time and comes through at the end. Some very very good characterizations of a whole multitude of cast members."
4,"Lightscribe or Double Layer DVD, but not both","If you want to burn a double layer DVD with a Lightscribe label you're going to have to wait until they make the media for it. Right now, as far as I can discover, you can either get Lightscribe-able CDs or 4.7 GB DVDs from Verbatim, but they don't make double layer DVDs that are also Lightscribe-able. So don't be disappointed, like I am, when you discover you can't use both really cool features on the same disc."
4,"It is the older ""Gothic"" Cult with some great songs","Before The Electric album and Sonic Temple The Cult had a softer--but still rocking--sound. There are a couple of bad songs on this CD, but it is in my top 10 of all time favorite albums. At least listen To the Title Track and ""Rain"" and you will have gotten your moneys worth"
4,This and Sonic Temple are their two best,"But those two are like night and day. Where sonic temple was big and bombastic here they're subduded and haunting(kind of like Ceromony done the right way). Making it all the more memorable than ST. While ST is something you would play at a party, Love is someting to listen to alone. Great tracks are all over this one: ""Rain(My personal favorite)"", ""She Sells Sanctuary"", ""Revolution"", ""Big Neon Glitter(With a great opening)"", ""Hollow Man"", ""Brother Wolf"", ""Nirvana"". A real fan favorite."
2,Not worth the money,Bought this calendar instead of my usual 365 dog a day desk calendar last year. Definitely inferior to the 365 dog days also by Workman. I buy about 10 dog calendars per year for myself and as gifts. This was the biggest and only disappointment of last years calendars.
2,Jeff sure is not his dad!!!!,"I waited with baited breath for this book to come out and when it did I was so disappointed I wanted to scream. My question harkens back to the 80's Wendy's commercial- ""Where's the Beef?"" Of Gods and Generals read more like my 8th grade text book than the work that this one is to prequal. The charachter development is not there-I was actually hoping Chamberlain would catch one in the head so I could stop listening to his whining. I was most disappointed with the treatment of Jackson in this pot boiler. Yes, Jackson was a fanatic but Shaara missed the boat in the way the men looked at him and how he preceived himself. Where is the scholarship in this novel. If you are going to write Historical Fiction at least include some History. For Pete's sake at least plagerize some Foote or somebody who knows a little about the Civil War. I will begrudgingly read The Last Full Measure. Jeff I am putting you on notice, do better research or go back to Florida and sell coins."
1,the book wasent as good as the killer angels.,"JEFF THIS BOOK MUST HAVE HIS FATHER ROOLING IN HIS GRAVE, THIS BOOK IS A BIG DISAPPOINTMEN! IT COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER."
1,disappointment,"poorly written. nowhere near the writer michael was. sorry, but i did not like this book. best bet would be to re-read Killer Angels."
1,Not even close.,Not even close to the Killer Angels. I had to force myself to read half of this book and finally gave up! The author does not have the gift his father had.
4,A Nice Complement to History Books,"At the time this was written there are 240 reviews on this book so I will not go into details about the story but just my impressions of the book.I liked the book due to its fast paced and ""man on the ground"" type of feel. Mr. Shaara writes well about battles and the history - in an overview sense - is mostly accurate mainly concentrating on Manassas, Fredricksburg and Chancellorsville.As in most of Mr. Shaara's books this one is also ""historical fiction"", an oxymoron if you ever head one, and is a very interesting character study of the major players. I especially enjoyed the characters of Jackson and Chamberlin and give thanks to this book for sparking my interest in those two fascinating figures which prompted me to read more about them.It is a very nice complement to history books and biographies I have previously read."
1,co-opted by the Lee-Jackson mafia,"The wretched Jeff Shaara, trying to find out how to make a living and deeply jealous of his father's abilities, went to Lexington Virginia when he started to research his (first) novel. He promptly fell under the spell of the Sons of the Confederacy and was lost forever. Michael Shaara's Killer Angels had plenty of historical inaccuracies, but it was full of profound truths about men at war. Longstreet, Lee, Chamberlain, Buford were real, flesh and blood, minds and hearts. Jeff Shaara writes Ol' South windbag history for wooden puppets. He should be ashamed of himself. He should limit himself to writing novels for the 10-17 boy market, since they seem to be his most enthusiastic fans. Awful book, soon to be an awful movie."
1,Shaara spreads himself too thin,"The writing style is annoying. The narrative gaps stick out like ugly roaches. His portrayal of Stonewall Jackson is not even close. Jackson's POV is MIA for 150 pages...where'd he go? I would have preferred an in-depth portrayal of a single battle (hey! just like _Killer Angels_!) instead of covering 2 years of the Civil War with the occasional in-depth portrayal of a battle. After thin descriptions of some battles, like 2nd Manassas, I felt very cheated. After no description of a battle, like 1st Manassas, I was enfuriated. Shaara offers nothing new to Civil War buffs; a lot of re-uttered platitudes from the PBS Civil War series. After I read this book, I said ""Been there, done that."" Read Shelby Foote instead."
4,READ THIS BEFORE KILLER ANGELS,"A great book, but I read Killer Angels first, which took away from the greatness of this book. READ THIS BEFORE KILLER ANGELS"
4,Gods and Generals,"I read this book before reading Robertson's biography of ""Stonewall"" Jackson. . . .this reading led me, after-the-fact, to be disappointed in some of Shaara's depictions of Jackson. . . the fascination with lemons myth for one. Also, Jackson's relationship with God is not as what Shaara depicts. Still, an excellent book which piqued my interest in learning more about Jackson. . .and for that I am grateful. Review within a review. . . Robertson's book is one of the best I have ever read and I recommend it to everyone who has an interest in history and biographies."
3,"A good read, but by no means ""classic"".","Knowing the facts about the Civil War, I was hoping that this novel would breathe more Life into it. The style is slow and laboured, and as far as sentence structure,...well,... I've read better prose. I liked all the main characters before reading the book, but Shaara didn't make me like them more, which, in essence, is what I was looking for at the outset. I rated this at three stars, but I really feel it was closer to two and a half. Borrow the book from the library or a friend, but don't buy it."
4,Beautifully Written Masterpiece,"Acturate and detailed story of the times preceding Gettysburg. If you want to learn about the Civil War, I can't think of a better book! I'm in 8th grade, and I had to read it. It was cool man! I was really mad about having to read such a big book, but that's because it goes into so much detail! I hardly wanted to put it down. Read it!"
5,Finding Andrew,"For anyone searching for an author that can bring characters to life on paper, Andrew Barriger is your man. Finding Peace is the continuing story of Taylor and Tom who faithfully came together in Finding Faith. You as the reader will find intrigue, romance, anger, sadness, joy and HOPE. This truly is a book you'll enjoy and re-read again. I only HOPE that the next installment, Finding Hope will be published soon."
4,almost perfect but 2 problems....,"I love s club 7 to death!!!! they are one of my favourite groups to ever come out... this LP is not different from their past releases...the problem with this disc is that TINA never really sings and i wanted her to shine a little bit on this LP since this is their last release.... there is no doubt in my mind that TINA BARRETT is my favourite member and she has that quality to be up to par with jo and rachel.and another thing this disc does not have the best vocal song by JO ever!!!!!! 'let me sleep' is the best song jo has ever sung... it shows her softer side... JO can really sing a ballad...'the greatest', 'gangsta love', 'you', 'dance, dance, dance', and 'show me your colours' are probably the best songs on the album...if you like S Club this is a no brainer that you have to buy it...3.5 stars"
5,music,use to have this on cassette tape there is one song on this that isnt on any of the greatest hits cds by Alabama
2,NOT MUCH HERE FOR SERIOUS STUDENTS,"LARGELY BIOGRAPHICAL IN NATURE, HOSTY DWELLS IN (TOO MUCH) DEPTH ON HIS PROBLEMS WITH THE HIERARCHY OF THE FBI. IN MY OPINION, THERE ARE POTENTIAL NUGGETS WHICH COULD HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED BUT WERE SHORT CHANGED IN HOSTY'S SELF DEFENSIVE NARRATIVE."
1,Stopped Working,I only used the DVD twice on two flights. The first one was fine. The picture was good but I had a hard time listing with the headphones over the airplane noise. The second flight going back it just stopped working. Luckly I was within the warranty period (by one day).
4,review,I liked the story and the way of presentation. The emtions were pure and well captured. Good acting and well enacted.
3,"Odd Movie, But You Can't Stop Watching","Bound by motherly love, interested in a man that is below him on a social scale, the man is imprisoned by who he is and what he really wants to be. It's a roller coaster ride of emotion. One moment you're applauding him and the next, you are actually hating the man for his coldness. Yet, let it be said that truth does find its way through the muddle and pain of a tortured soul. Let's face it. Without truth, why exist? Interesting movie. The filming was rather poor, but the story kept my interest."
3,The String,"This was a nicely filmed movie, but the development of the characters, and the story line was a bit confusing. I felt it was meandering and lacked focus."
1,????????????,What is this supposed to do???????? It might get a higher rating if there was a description!!!
3,Am I using it right?,"I got this because I've seen all the cooks on TV use them lately and thought it was suppposed to make a better cookie. It hasn't seemed to work that way for me. Maybe I need to alter my recipe if I'm using this? I don't know, but so far, I'm not wanting to use it, cause I don't like the way it cooks my stuff."
3,Excellent but... it stains,"I finally got a Silpat that would fit my baking sheet with just a tiny little gap on the corners, since my oven is not that big, it took me a while to have the right kind of baking sheet and the right size of silpat. They sell silpat here locally unfortunately it's either they are way too big or way too small.The only thing that I didn't like about this is that they are a bit more expensive than the other size Silpat, I wonder why. The other thing is that when I baked chocolate Chip Cookies on it, it left a stain though I read it somewhere that it's normal. I just don't like the way it looks dirty all the time :("
2,Crummy Blender,"Some people love this thing, but I find it to be the worst blender ever. It can't even handle making a simple fruit smoothie and leaves big chunks of banana and other fruit. The only good thing about it is its size, but I have since bought a Cuisinart Blender and find its function superior. Also, a handheld Braun mixer wand for $20 is far better for making smoothies, pureeing foods, etc. Maybe the Magic Bullet is good for whip cream, gooey alfredo sauce and other smooth things they show in t.v., but alot of us don't eat heavy junk like that on a daily basis and I find it to be completely lacking in the daily things I need a blender for."
1,not what i expected,"i loved the magic bullet commercial. watched it a lot.. got the MB and i was excited.. it didnt work at all. i am dissapointed, and returning it."
4,Bullet,"Does a very good job for what I want, so far. I have had it about 1 month and I am quite pleased. Let's see how long it lasts!"
1,Magic???? Hardly!!,"Don't be fooled by the slick editing of this infommercial. This product is nothing more than a glorified smoothie maker...well, it does make 'mush' also. The multi-selection of containers to use is convenient and easy to clean up, if you don't mind drinking out of plastic.It's juicing capabilities are laughable. After noisily and clumsily juicing about 2 oz. of carrots (that's the only vegetable that seems to work), it clogs and jams.Although I love the concept, this product in my opinion is nothing but a rip-off."
4,so far so good,"I've made the mousse, chopped an onion, and made a smoothie so far. All turned out fine. The onion didn't chopped entirely b/c some pieces were rubbery, but it certainly didn't turn to mush when done properly according to the techniques in the manual. You can also go the the product website's FAQ's and see short demonstrations of certain techniques you may be having trouble with. That helped me out. I hope it lasts and I also hope they start selling the larger recipe book separately b/c it looks like you can only buy that in conjunction with a bullet purchase for now. It did smell like rubber the first time, but it's brand new. Lots of blenders do that, even my $90 cuisinart. Like other's said, never run it for more than 1mn. It only took about 15 seconds for my smoothie to mix with crushed ice and frozen strawberries, and it was FULLY mixed, just used enough liquids and you'll be good to go."
4,Great for smoothies...BUT...,"I use this everyday to make a smoothie and I have never used anything that purees the ingredients so well. Just don't use it for anything else. After four months I decided to give the ol' Magic Bullet a test at what it could do. Since the manual said it could grind coffee beans I figured it could make peanut butter. Wrong. Motor died after 8 seconds of use. I ran to Bed, Bath and Beyond and got another one the same night. I'm just never going to use it for anything but smoothies from now on..."
3,The blades are not as sharp as advertised,"If you need a dedicated blender to make just smoothies, this is the right buy, hence the 3 stars. The only caveat is the ingredients have to be soft like strawberry and banana. I tried using frozen blueberries, it didn't blend well. If you're looking to replace your current blender, don't waste your money. It comes with 2 kinds of blades. I used the one they recommended for making hummus and I ended up mashing the beans by hand. Now I need to do research to buy a real blender."
4,Great for the sneaky chef,"I love my magic bullet, I've had it for more than a few months now and use it multiple times a day. It's great for blending up pureed veggies to sneak into my kids foods. My favorite is a blueberry banana smoothie with spinach. I don't think it's good for chopping veggies or blending raw crunchy veggies but it's great for a basic smoothie and for blending cooked veggies. I love how easy it is to clean up after and keep on your counter. I suggest it for all of my clients. I would also highly recommend it for making baby food.Becky MahonyNutrition Educator[...]"
3,Good,"So far so good it makes great marguretas and pancakes but I haven't had it long enough to really put it through it's paces. One of the plastic seals has already broken and had to be replaced. That's one thing you have to watch, that the seal remains in place. The plastic components are in fact dishwasher safe. I have not tried it in the microwave yet. All in all I am pleased with the product."
2,Okay but not strong,"This item is for simple mixing,my husband had to have it, and now finds that my smoothie maker (blender type) does a better job. The magie bullet cannot crush up ice cubes, and does only small amounts. Would not recommend this product."
4,Magic Bullet,"We've only used our Bullet for smoothies, but so far it's done a great job. It doesn't chop frozen fruit as well as I'd like, but for the most part, it's a great kitchen addition. I live in an RV, so I really appreciate how small it is as I never wanted to make room for a traditional sized blender just to make smoothies. I'm looking forward to trying the Bullet to do other mixing."
1,Not as good as they say,"The 5 star ratings are probably being given by the sales people themselves. This bullet doesn't do what they advertise. The pulse 3 tap method for chopping onions is all lies. This machine will puree anything you put in it. It doesn't chop when it's supposed to. Perhaps the small cups to make smoothies are the only thing worthwhile here.Next time you watch the commercial, pay attention to when the lady is making alfredo sauce. She puts the cup in the microwave but there's another one in there already. Anyway, like they say ""if it looks too good to be true..."""
3,Worked pretty well till it broke,"My Magic Bullet worked fine until it randomly broke. I had it for a year and a half, and usually used it at least once a day. Smoothies were a staple in my diet. It does NOT work well as a juicer. But I should point out I have never seen another juicer so maybe they just annoy me.Mine broke the same way as that of A. Verchimak of Illinois. I was belnding something and I heard a crack, and then the motor sounded really high pitched, and it stopped spinning the blade. When I picked it up I saw that teh bottom black part was cracked. I am debating weather to buy it again."
1,cheap junk,Do not waste your money. The bullet express is made out of cheap plastic. It is hard to clean and the parts don't fit well together. I just bought it and already one part is messed up. It is overpriced and not any better than food processor that cost much less. There is no way to get them fixed.For something that costs so much more than other food processor it should be easier to use and to clean. Very disappointed.The Bullet Express System (W/ Bonus Juicer Express)
1,"""gotcha piece""","The ""gotcha piece"" I am talking about is the plastic gear on the base unit that drives the blade unit. It is the piece they make out of plastic so when it breaks you buy another unit. I have had two Magic Bullets and in both cases this piece broke. If they would make it out of metal it would not break and your unit would last longer(duh!). I will not buy another one. I will go back to a blender."
5,its just ok!!!,"I've only had this for a short while maybe after I get the hang of it ,I will like it better...It works ok, as long as you make just drinks...which makes it about as good as any other blender on the market...and more expensive than most.Anything else it just tends to liquify, even using the ""pulse"" method they suggest.It does leave lumps..Cleaning is ok..."
1,It Is A Piece Of [...] !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I give it -5 stars.After using it 2 times, yes 2 times, the blade teeth grinded down to nothing with Pineapple and Watermelon ""as advertised"". I finally got the place where I bought it to send me some more. Trying to get the old ones off, I broke the power base. After buying a New power base, and getting new blade teeth, it makes such a mess with the juicer, I just completely give up on it. A whole large lemon gave me 1/3 teaspoon of juice.I should have known after all these years that things like that were nothing but crap but I fell for the infomercial and gave it a try. [...]"
3,We like the Magic Bullet,"My mother and I purchased the Magic Bullet. We like the bullet overall, however, I agree with the other reviews that the Juicer doesn't make very good carrot juice. But to make a salad spread it does a wonderful job without much preparation. We think this will be a very useful appliance."
1,I feel like an infomercial idiot!,"I had to get this after seeing the infomercial. When I received it and read the book I realised that this does nothing more than any other blender. And in order to ""follow the recipes"" you are starting with a lot of premixed and premade ingredients-that's what makes it quicker. It crushes ice very poorly and only in very small amounts. I'm guessing they used pre crushed ice on the infomercial too. Not worth the $39 I paid for it and definitely not worth the $59 that it's being sold for in stores."
2,Not as good as advertised,"I was hoping for a stronger product. It's not a bad product my biggest complaint is the motor isn't very strong and it smells like something's burning when I use it. Even the manual says not to run motor longer than one minute at a time, then you have to rest it a few minutes before you can reuse it. I wish I had known that before I purchased it. Also there are rubber gaskets in the blade tops you have to keep up with that fall out all the time especially in the dish machiner. My suggestion, buy a blender."
2,Leaks and unscrews easily,"I just bought mine, it has a date of manufacture of July 2006. I bought this to mix up some drinks, like a protein shake. My first attempt the thing unscrewed itself and the mix got over part of it. This is a big problem... The unit is not UL approved (or any safety agency) and a greater of shock hazard could exist. When this starts to unscrew itself you cannot get it out of the base when it is latched in for continuous use. I had to pull the plug from the receptacle, fun when your hands are wet from this unscrewing. The second time I figured I'd make sure it was tight, so I gave it some extra muscle. As I went to insert it into the base, it began to leak through the threads. I had to put a lot into tightening it before it would stop leaking. Could a larger gasket help? Maybe! I think this product is a good cocept, but sadly implemented. Hopefully a large company will knock it off, improve it, reduce it costs, safety agency approve it and sell it in stores nationwide."
1,Don't bother buying!!!,"I received a Magic Bullet as a gift, all I can say is I'm glad I didn't buy it. After seeing the infomercial I thought if it really works like that then I would probably use it a lot, well..the infomercial is like a lot of others, promices great results but does not deliver. tried to make the chicken salad, the bullet really struggled to do this, everything kinda of got spun to the sides so had to do a lot of scraping the stuff down, sure wasn't the quick 1 2 3 like you see on tv. Plus I just ended up with mush. Also tried the sorbet with no luck, after several attempts and again scraping down the sides, I gave up...not to mention the device began to smell like it was about to burn up. Boxed it back up and put it away as it's no use to me. will stick to using my food processor."
2,"Great for 3 months, then stopped working","The Magic Bullet worked great for 3 months. I used it frequently to make fruit smoothies. I was very careful never to run the motor for more than 1 minute at a time, in accordance with the instructions. One day I was blending a smoothie and it worked for about 10 seconds, then it just stopped and has not worked since. This was about 3 months after I purchased it. A waste of money; I bought the ""set"" so now I have a set of cups with lids for it, but no base motor. I would agree with others who say buy a better machine."
4,Magic Bullet,"It's very cool. I was a little intimidated when I saw all the parts, but it's quite the handy little item for the kitchen. Love it."
4,"Okay, I haven't exactly challenged the thing.","So far, I've made asparagus soup and it was too easy. Using the recipe book, I bought the ingredients (all I needed from the store was the veggie). I zapped the food in the large serving container provided, added half and half, and pureed it in the Bullet. The blade, container, and steamer lid cleaned up in the top of the dishwasher. I noticed a ""tired motor"" smell after I used the Bullet, but wasn't concerned. If I use the same recipe, different veggie(s), and get the same results then the Bullet will make par for me. Anything else is a bonus. :-)"
1,I would not recommend it!,"It worked for a while, then the plastic started braking. No one sells replacements parts. I dealt with it for a little while longer, then the plastic part of the motor assembly broke. Now it's useless, going to landfill tomorrow."
1,DIFFICULT TO RETURN MAGIC BULLET AFTER IT ARRIVED BROKEN,"Magic Bullet Express 17-Piece High-Speed Blender Mixing Systemin order to make baby food for our special needs 9-month old twins during our visit to their grandparents, i ordered this item to be delivered to their rural home, but the magic bullet arrived and didnt work. THE ENTIRE EXPERIENCE WITH AMAZON.COM WAS VERY FRUSTRATING. i was unable to get an address to return the item and amazon.com told me to carry it on the airplane while i travelled back home until they were able to inform me of an address to return the item and they could not confirm that i would get a full credit and/or be reimbursed for shipping/handling. this item is great as i have one at my home and many of our friends love it; just do not buy it from a provider that has a bad return process."
2,Disappointment - Customer Service at Magic Bullet,"When my wife has questions and called the Customer Service at Magic Bullet, they are just rude and don't know how to entertain their customers. The product is not user-friendly just like their Customer Service. I would suggest don't waste your time and money on the machine as well as the customer service over there."
1,Don't Waste Your Money!,"I received this as a gift and for the first 3 months, I loved it and used it to make smoothies. After only 3 months of use, though, the motor went completely dead. I contacted the manufacturer's (Home Land Housewares) customer support but, even though I registered the product online, you have to have the receipt for them to fix it. Since it was a gift and I didn't have the receipt, they wanted to charge me $20 for a new motor that I would have to install. For a $60 small blender, this is outrageous. I'm very disappointed in the dismal quality of this product and the terrible customer service."
4,good product,i use this everyday for a slushi at lunch. the 4 blade chopper started getting sloppy after about a year and a half and would leak since u use it upsidedown. good product for the money. wish they had a better version with a roller bearing in the chopping blade setup. would be worth the extra $ however u dont sell more if they dont wear out in a through away society.
2,Disappointed it still has food on it. Price too high for used one,This is the third time I've written to you.I am disappointed that u charged me the same price I could have had a new one. This magic billet still has food caked on bottom. I was going to send it back but u charge me $11.00 plus. For postage n then a 20% restock. That leaves me paying way too much $48.00 for a used magic bullet when I could have bought a new one - which I thought this one was! -for the same price at bed bath n beyond. I saw the icky caked on food n just put it back in the box. I bought one at b b & b the next day because you said my order did not go thru. N then u said it did n sent me this one.This was my first experience with amazon. Probably won't order anything elseThank you.Peg
5,love it!,"I love my MAgic Bullet! I am changing my eating habits and using protein shakes to start my day. The MAgic Bullet is an all in one blender. I put my liquids, powder and ice in, blend it, then remove the power unit and the container becomes my cup to go. Less to clean than a blender because the blender becomes the cup. I love it!"
1,cheaply made,"The Magic Bullet falls under the category of ""They don't make things like they used to"". I have used mine a total of maybe 30 times in just over a year. Early on, one of the plastic tabs snapped off. Two months ago, the second one snapped off. This morning, the third tab just snapped off as I was placing the blender onto the motorized base. Without those three tabs to fit into the three corresponding grooves, the motor will not work and essentially you have no Magic bullet. Called to complain. They told me they would send me a new blender unit for 18 dollars and told me I was too aggressive with the thing. Not true! This is a cheaply made product that I am done with. No confidence I will spend 18 dollars and it will last any longer!"
2,Loved the concept but in reality did not perform,"Loved the concept, but after using for one week, the plastc ""rivits"" that the main frame grabs on to, to spin the grinder frayed and will no linger spun to grind. I am very upset. I did not save the box so I'm stuck with a product I spent $50.00 for with no ability to return it and no contact number to discuss my experience with. I'm very dissatisfied."
2,Not as good as it might seem,"This machine is perfect for doing slushies, smoothies, iced drinks and frozen drinks. Anything beyond that is a failure. It doesn't dice fruits and veggies, it liquefies them. You don't get nicely chopped pieces of anything. You get clumps of food stuck around the blades, liquified gunk and you certainly don't get anything mixed well.The infomercial makes it look nice and easy. Just pulse and VOILA you have perfectly diced and mixed salsa. In reality you have mushed up chili peppers stuck in the blades and some tomato puree.I'd skip this unless you want it exclusively for drinks."
1,Decent product... BAD warranty,"I've had my Magic Bullet for 5 months. I use it mostly for smoothies, and it works great. Chopping onions or anything else, it turns them to mush. The base no longer shuts off when I remove the cup, until I unplug the base. Customer Service was happy to send me a replacement, but they charge $10 for shipping. As they pointed out, it does clearly state in the warranty that shipping on replacements is not included, but they don't even offer a repair location or any alternative. You pay more money for them to ship you a replacement, or you're stuck with a broken item. Luckily, at least mine still works. What kind of 1 year warranty is that?? Buy a good knife and a decent blender and forget this product!"
1,It Broke,I received the Magic Bullet as a gift--I loved making homemade sauces with it until it broke. I got maybe 3 weeks worth out of it before it broke. A pretty worthless product!!
3,So far so good,"I have read the other reviews about the ice and gears wearing out. I have had mine for about a month now. I put ice in it everyday and frozen fruit. It hasn't stopped working yet. I drink smoothies for breakfast almost every morning. I love the way this think makes one cup. When I used to use my blender it made about 3 times as much as I needed. Plus, I hated the clean up.On the downside, this thing does NOT make tuna salad, guacamole etc. The design is not suited for pulse chopping fruits, veggies and such. It just creams whatever is closest to the blade and the rest is left in large chunks at the top.I only bought it to make smoothies so I am not really concerned about the other stuff. If you want to make really good tuna salad, guacamole and things like that get a Cuisinart. They rock!"
4,Hand grip for my KelTek postol,Works great...a little long but then again that's what I was looking for...to cover those pinchie spots between the mag well and the extended mag.
5,Fits my Kel-Tec PF9 and Ruger SR22,"I have purchased 3 of these over the past several months. I currently use the grip on my Kel-Tec PF9 and Ruger SR22. There was minimal trimming required to get it to not interfere with the safety or magazine on the PF9, and absolutely no trimming to fit it on the SR22.The third one I got was for my Diamondback DB9, but because the grip on the gun is so short I had to do major trimming, nearly cutting the Hogue in half. In the end I didn't like the jagged finish (my fault for hastily cutting) and ended up scrapping it.These grips do a wonderful job improving the ergonomics on both guns, which initially felt too small to handle comfortably. Also, when I carry inside-the-waistband I feel like I get a better draw because of the extra friction provided by the Hogue. There is noticable reduction in perceived recoil on the PF9 at the range. Great product, and I intend to try again on getting one on my DB9."
5,TIght Wrap,"looks good, feels good, and doesn't slip... goes on tightly and stays put. I would definitly recommend this product for your gun."
4,Fits well,"This grip fits my 3rd gen. Glock 36 well but it was pretty hard to get on (very tight fit). I use this in conjunction with a Crimson Trace laser sight that has the activation switch at the middle finger location of the grip.This fits over the activation switch but does not cause it to stay on, which is perfect because the switch had to be pushed very hard to activate before.Overall this cover changes the feel of the grip for the better as it is nice and gripy without tearing up your hand during extended shooting sessions."
5,Best Grip,"Hogue makes the best grips around, so if you want to stay connected to your weapon, buy this!Be warned that this grip is really small, so unless you have a really small caliber handgun, thisprobably won't work. I wound up putting mine on a fore grip and it was tight!"
5,Great Addition,I bought this for my Kahr Cw9. I have big hands and the standard single stack grip on the Kahr leaves something to be desired in the ergonomics department. This totally transforms the feel of the pistol. Love it!
4,Fits Kahr P380 with minor trimming,"Feels really good on my Kahr P380.Had to trim a bit off the bottom with an exacto knife, but it cuts really cleanly.Just that little bit of extra girth makes a world of difference.Note that I do not have really big hands, so the finger hump was in the right place for me.Might need to be installed upside down to fit bigger hands. When put on upside down, it hits the magazine release button a bit."
5,Makes your firearm melt in your hands.,"I am currently using this for my Kel-Tec P11 (9mm).Pros:-Rubber grip allows for a very firm, tight, and comfortable grip.-Fits the Kel-Tec P11 perfectly with no trimming needed.Cons:-Hard to get on and reposition.Thoughts:In order to get this on to your firearm I recommend that you soak this in HOT (not boiling) water for a few minutes to let the rubber relax and stretch. Then check to make sure your firearm is unloaded (I took my slide off). Then start on one side and get it about an inch onto the grip, holding that side firmly (you could use a vise maybe) stretch the rubber to the other side of the grip. After about 5 tries I succeeded. Once it is on both sides it is only a matter of working each side up a bit at a time. If you have a NON-Metal firearm, I recommend adding a bit of warm water while sliding it up. Let the rubber rest when you are done and you will be able to shoot in no time."
1,"Not worth it, cheap plastic.",This ripped when I tried to stretch it on my XD.40 sub compact. This is garbage and stay away from.
2,Bummed,Couldn't get grip on. Then my husband tore it. Not such a great item. Disappointed. Must keep looking. Wish guns just came with optional rubber grips for each model.
3,"not as ""universal"" as I expected","I have used Hogue grips before but these for my P3AT just did not ""git er done"". I trimmed and adjusted and twisted but they still did not fit quite right. I ended up with a couple layers self sticking cloth type tape that does the job quite well. Sorry Hogue."
4,Great feel. Struggled with fit.,It wasnt that hard to install but i had to trim up the bottom for a custom fit. All in all pretty easy. It has made me love my Kel Tec PF-9 more!
4,Fits my LC9 just fine,"Does what it says, fits my LC9 fine. Some wo are a little more anal about the fit would trim it a bit around the magazine release or around the base of the grip. I like this grip a lot, took some elbow grease to put it on but I prefer to know it fits snug."
4,I like it..,"I like it , but it did not fill up my hand after I put it on my weapon. It was a little too thin for me. It will do until I find something a little thicker. I will say buy it if you have small hands(women) It fits the weapon well,so it gets 4 stars..."
3,"Decent product, but you need to cut to fit.","Easy to install, but is a universal grip that I had to cut some from the bottom to fit my Ruger LCP .380. Good product for the price and works well."
2,Tore on Installation,Ordered for Kahr P9; tore on installation rendering product unusable; cannot recommend. I'll probably have my gunsmith install wrap around grip.
2,Not happy..Instructions much too basic.,If you are looking for extremely basic instructions on how to use your fishfinder then this product is good. I was looking for a more detailed explanation of what I was looking at on the screen from a structure perspective not how to set it up. This was not offered and I was very disappointed.
5,Bert,This is the best of the three Archeophone CDs of Bert Williams. They are all worth having. This one demonstrates what a great entertainer he was and what all the reviews was about. Very much worthwhile.
2,The White Suit Says It All,"John Denver became my favorite male vocalist more than 25 years ago, and he remains my favorite long past his untimely death. His album ""It's About Time"", however, is anything but a favorite. The arrangements and accompaniments carry such a forced big band sound that any beauty of the lyrics are totally lost. This album is incredibly over-produced, with none of the simplicity, soul, and heartfelt vocals that characterizes Denver's best works. The white suit on the cover photo says it all. This ain't John Denver, folks, it was the producer trying to mold him into a new image. Only the anchor song ""It's About Time"" is genuine Denver. My advice: find these songs on a live album without the studio band and the producer, and forget this one."
2,"Over promised, under delivered","Having worked in the financial risk management business for more than 15 years with significant experience in structured financial instruments, the book was not particularly useful to me. I believe the book may be of use for training young associates in need of a primer. The author uses relevant examples which would be helpful to those with little context. The tone of the book would lead me to conclude that author is quite cynical regarding the actual use of CDO's and other structured products. I don't think anyone working in the business would find much new here; certainly not a reference book."
5,"thank you carlos, for this masterpiece!","Silver Dreams Golden Reality is a monumental masterpiece of the great guitar player Carlos Santana.In this albun,we can fell all the light of this ""genius"" of the music.Unfortunately, Carlos became a mediocre artist in this recent albuns,Shaman and All that I'm.Please Carlos,come back......to this real music!"
5,love it love it love it,"while there are a couple of tracks I skip over, the tracks I love rank as some of my favorite songs I've ever heard. ""lion's mouth"" always gives me goosebumps, it is a striking piece of synth funk, period. on a plane is too cool, there are some stellar tracks on this one as well, as I said before, if you get all three cds (white feathers, islands, crazy people's right to speak) and listen to them, while there may be tracks you jump over, the LEVEL OF TOP NOTCH SONGS IS MINDBLOWING! each album has many more winners than losers, and the songs you like on it, just blow you away. I can't think of many bands, especially a sound as tough as new wave to do well often, that I can say this about. They are a talented lot to be sure."
4,Title is a little mis-leading,"Having read the book... it is less about what most people think of flirting and more about how to start conversations and be open to people and get over rejection anxiety. It is not a scientific book, but a breezy description of techniques and attitudes to use when you engage some one in a conversation. It may lead somewhere or it may not, but not starting gets you know where.There are most specific books on flirting in the common usage, and on more assertively look for romance....this book has it's place but is not the be all and end of the subject."
5,Classic Steve Taylor,"When I encountered Steve Taylor's music in the 1980s, it was a breath of fresh air. This album captures the energy and creativity of a great artist and a great Christian."
1,Good luck if you need tech help,"After installing Internet Security 6.0 it created a corrupted file in my Outlook registry. OK, so when I went for tech help, the phone number listed is in RUSSIA. Or - I could email the question to the tech desk. Not so fast... First you have to have a customer ID and password. Never mind that after buying the software you had to enter the key which registers 1 user. So why can't the use that info? Anyway after going through the drill they send me my customer ID number but my password is sent separately in a zip file. What's up with that?!? I don't have a zip program so I can't open it. The catch 22 is there is no tech desk email address to contact them to tell them to just send me the damn password in a text message so I can contact them with my problem. I did find an email address for ""info"" so I emailed that address about my plight and of course have not heard back. Thank you, Comrad!"
5,The only Security Suite that Won't hog your resources,"In the past few months, I've owned or demoed several security suites (Norton, Mcafee, ZoneAlarm, V-Com) in my quest to find the least obtrusive suite (i.e. smart enough to not constantly harass you with firewall questions everytime you look at the keyboard) that does not completely hog all my PC's resources. Not only is Kaspersky's highly effective, other than spam-blocking (according to the reviews I've read), but it also hogs a lot less of my PC's resources, both in terms of its always-on functions as well as the regularly scheduled scans and updates. I can actually use my PC during scans with little noticeable performance degradation, which is something I cannot say for any of the other suites I've tried, praticularly ZA's and Norton's."
2,Less than overwhelming,"Really not as good as I expected from some of the reviews posted. I take a lot of scripts (at least 4 different ones daily) and a lot of supplements (in the dozen range) too, but I did not find it easy to cross check in this book.I would not recommend it very highly..."
1,What a Joke...,"Our landlord gave us a couple of these thinking they would ""solve our ant problem."" Ha, the ants walked in a few times, walked right out and then ignored the things and never went back. Our ant problem actually got worse after putting these out. I don't even feel right giving this product 1 star. Terro ant killer is the way to go."
2,BORRRRRING!,"Firstly, as a 18 year long Madonna fan, I know a ton about her - why was her relationship with Rodman only commented on with a few sentences? The hilarious ""Truth or Dare"" is barely mentioned, especially since she treated most people who worked for her like garbage (such as when her make up girl was raped, NOT die in 1999! Is there an editor at this publishing company or not? This book is very, how do I put it, dull. Go to a local used book store and by any used mass market paperback for a few bucks, because all the info from those books is in here. Some facts are at looked in depth, such as her hard days in New York in the late 1970s. But, there are so few unearthed facts, I say, WHY BOTHER!?!"
2,Andrew Morton can even make Madonna's life seem boring,"I am a huge fan of Madonna and was looking forward to an entertaining read...the keyword here is entertaining. Like others have said, Morton's writing is terrible. I know that he is a respected writer of biographies... but this was terrible! I don't know how he did it but he even made Madonna seem boring. The writing didn't flow. Details of later events were thrown in previous chapters and then completed ignored later when they should apply. I felt it was poorly organized and poorly written. Even huge fans will be disappointed. Hopefully Madonna will write her own one day."
1,Please!!!!!,"I have a simple question: Could this author not uncover ANYTHING new about Madonna? Not a thing? This is really a rip off. There is not one thing in this book people who are even remotely familiar with Madonna will not already know. At least when I read the last Madonna book (J. R. Taraborrelli's), I thought he uncovered a lot of new ground. But this guy, Morton, just ripped off the other guy's book (Taraborelli's), and didn't even try to act like he didn't. Whole passages! Come on! Enough, already. No more Madonna books, please. Wait for the paperback of Taraborelli's if you simply must buy a Madonna book -- but save your money and forget about this one. Even poor Princess Diana -- who Andrew Morton also wrote about -- would be bored to tears by this one. I can't believe this even came out!!!! I want my money back."
1,Not effective on smoke smells in a car,"I had high hopes for this product after reading all the great reviews on it, but was sorely disappointed after trying it out.I had purchased a used car with a faint odor of smoke in it and tried this purifier to remove it. I left it in overnight, took a whiff the next morning, and no change in the odor. I kept it in the charger for weeks afterwards, and still - no change. It was a waste of my time and money. Just glad it was pretty cheap -I still have yet to find any product effective for removing that musty odor."
2,Fail,"Generally speaking, these little ionizers are kind of amazing.This one, however, is all sorts of fail. It worked for maybe a week. The bright LED's are annoying.Go buy this one instead:Wagan EL2022 Ionic Air Purifier"
1,Junk!!! It Corroded!!!,"The ""Roadpro 12V Mini Air Purifier/Ionizer"" I received worked for a couple of weeks then stopped. I took a look at it and it had corroded, almost like a battery. Very disappointed with the product."
1,Great Idea but Very MESSY!,This is the worst Doddle product I had purchased by far. It was a great idea but somebody at Fisher Price needs to go back to the drawing boards. The little sponge that comes with it is suppose to clean the board when wet. Ha ha. It just smears it all over the board and it gets all over your hands and everything else. Then you have to dry it to use it again. Yucky and Messy! Don't waist your money like I did. We even bought the extra pads.
5,Blown away by the amount of info in the book!,I got the book before my last trip and I fell in love with it. Within a day I had post-its all through it or things I wanted to check out on my next trip to Walt Disney World. Mr. Mongello did a wonderful job with this book. And the website that goes along with it is full of even MORE interesting facts!A must for all Walt Disney World Fans!
4,Very interesting book,"This book has a ton of info in it. Not only does it give your answers, it explains them as well. Now I need to get the next edition!!"
1,"Very disappointed, don't waste your money",I looked forward to this book for weeks before it arrived and I was highly disappointed. I don't think I have ever hated a book's format as much as I hate this one. Questions are presented in multiple choice at the beginning of each chapter. Then you have to flip several pages to find a list of answers. The questions and answers never appear on the same page any where in the book so if you're looking for a casual read you've found the wrong book. All your time is spent flipping pages and matching questions with answers. There may be some interesting information in it but I haven't found time to read far enough in to find it. I do not recommend this book!
3,Trivia details are great,the organization of the trivia could be less test like and more immediate with answers closer to the questions...Good information and details
1,Don't buy this box if you have a Panasonic DMP-BD60 player,"These blue rays don't play on my Panasonic DMP-BD60 Blue ray player with the latest firmware update.The player works just fine with other recently purchased blue ray disks.I returned the box set and had Amazon replace it , same result."
3,Blast from the past,"I bought this to learn the music for our production of ""la Cage"" now I take it out at parties & everyone dances around the room to some of the songs. Great if you are having a ""French"" dinner party."
2,The last game was better....,"The graphics in this game are pretty unimpressive, and the game play is ackward. Me and my husband both don't like it, expected a LOT more!"
2,So-So,"If you love golf games this is a must buy. However, because EA has exclusive licenses for all of sports, you have no choice. I still think Links was the best ever for gameplay. Overall I like this game, but the graphics are not that much better on the 360. I didn't think the word WOW at all. If being Tiger while playing, you cannot be beat by anyone. They made that way too easy. My buddies and I find that the putting is way too easy.I got mine from the big auction website, so I only paid $40 which included shipping. That makes it ok for me. I would never pay $60 as it is no where near worth $60. Almost anything EA is not worth $60."
5,Yeah man!,"Eric Alexander is one of the greatest players out there as far as I'm concerned and this CD proves it. The first track is a driving original by Eric titled, ""One For M."" Beautiful solos by trumpter John Swana, Eric, Pianist Richard Wyands, and drummer Kenny Washington. Basist Peter Washington never misses a beat either. Other great tracks to check out are, ""Wives and Lovers"", ""Swedish Schnapps"", and a bluesy original fom Eric called, ""The Moving Blues."" Check this CD out if you want to hear some authentic New York sounds. You won't regret it, I guarantee it! -Casey Fitzpatrick"
3,pretty but broken,This was just what I needed except that it was packed badly. It has a couple pieces of paper around it in a box with a little bubble wrap. It arrived cracked up one side. I was really dissappointed.
5,great early elvis,"Recently, I decided to check out Elvis Golden Records volume 2. The version I have is the original 10 track album that runs about 22 minutes. Big Hunk o' Love, and many other of Elvis' gold singles make up this collection. This along with Golden Records volume 1, are great places to start building your elvis collection."
4,Jo,"Sandra is a beautiful dancer who has a graceful, traditional style with a playful flair. The video is presented clearly and is easy to follow and user friendly."
3,Serviceable.,"Interesting little kit. Tripod is barely strong enough to hold up my DSLR with a lens, but the filters are really why I bought this kit anyway. Filter quality is fine, so far. Not the best polarized filter I've ever seen, but it helps enough to reduce glare."
2,Not as good as I had hoped,"Probably good fit for an adult, but something like this is usually more for a beginning student (typically children). I had to spend a lot of time modifying this to fit my 7 year old student who had managed to break/lose 2 other more expensive shoulder rests. I will be going a different direction in the future. At least it didn't cost much to try."
2,Not a hover craft,This is a fun toy but it is not a real hover craft. The back wheels are always on the ground. It's also pretty slow in the water- it does move quickly on a road.
5,"Sir, can I have some more, please!!",LOVE IT! LOVE IT! LOVE IT! I'm so glad I stumbled over this CD. I listen to it on low volume while I work (Massage Therapist) and my clients love it. And when I drive home I blare it. Probably one of the only CD's in the world that can give you those extremes. I want MORE.
5,Feelin' Groovy,Got the CD in good time/great shape and enjoyed revisiting my past! Thanks for the help! Great transaction!
3,Better than I anticipated!,"I have only a few tasks / year to tackle, so did not want to spend a lot of money. This saw worked great. It's sluggish, but it cuts very clean. If you don't need a real work horse, this one's for you!"
1,Worst Soccer Game Ever!,"This game is even worse than the Road to the World Cup from 2002. I have been playing FIFA soccer games since World Cup 98 was out on the Sega Genesis. This is by far the worst of all of them. I would rather play FIFA 98 on Sega than this game on 360.The game play is terrible: passing is unpredictable, players IQ on your own team is subpar, and shooting is impossible.The description for this game on Amazon is not for this game, b/c you can only play with international teams on this game, there are no club teams or career modes.By far, this game is terrible, and if I were worried about the money I spent on this game, I would complain to Amazon, EA, and Xbox 360. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME FOR ANY REASON. FIFA World Cup 2006 is a great game with great gameplay. Please do yourself a favor and buy it instead."
5,Lissibeth,"This cookbook is a joy to own. It makes a wonderful gift for a new bride or anyone who enjoys cooking. It contains great foods that are quick and easy. No home should be without one!The lowfat recipes are especially great for those of us who are watching our waistlines. My husband's favorite is ""Libby's Zesty Chicken Twist"" recipe on page 26. The recipes that I've tried have been delicious with easy to follow directions.This is a must for your cookbook collection! I highly recommend this cookbook."
4,Flashlight Battery,"This battery work's just fine,why pay twice the amount for a Durcell one.I rate this product a four star rating for an lantern battery."
4,Product is fine but postage is too high,I ordered 1 lb of Sorghum flour from Barry Farm Foods. The flour is fine and costs $1.99 but the postage cost was $7.50! That is really too much compared to the cost of the product. I think the postage rates should be stated clearly before the product order is confirmed.Regina T.L.H.San Francisco
3,one good song,I purchased this based on one song that I had heard on the radio. The album wasn't what I expected. I still like that song.
3,Product was old.,"I love Rub N' Buff. It is an easy way to change the look of picture frames, etc... Sadly, it seems almost impossible to get a fresh tube these days. The oil and pigment should come out together so you can easily blend it on the desired surface with a soft cloth or your finger. This tube of Ebony was somewhat separated, but I was able to use it. Other tubes bought at the same time, were badly separated ( oil squirts out first and then grainy pigment) and difficult to blend. I would buy it again only if I could be certain of its condition."
5,Rowland rolls out more Soler.,"One of the highlights of the Naxos catalogue is the series devoted to the complete keyboard sonatas of Padre Antonio Soler (1729-1783). 10 of a projected 14 or 15 CDs have already been issued.Good planning has ensured that highlights can be encountered in every volume you might chance to try. The very first Soler sonata I ever heard and subsequently tried to play is found in this 9th volume of the series, Sonata No 84 in D, together with one of the four movement sonatas.Contrasting with the seemingly relentless high spirits and scampering, headlong motion that characterizes so much of the music, you'll hear one or two graver sonatas, such as No 132 and No 24.Gilbert Rowland provides his own insightful notes and 73 minutes of well-recorded harpsichord playing on this budget-priced CD."
5,just saw them live March 8/2004,"I've been listening to the LP for some time now and it has really grown on me. My girlfriend (a lover of British music) was skeptical of how they would sound live. Her ears are still ringing from the show last night. Other than the fact that the typical Toronto crowd just stood there and bobbed their heads the show was amazing. Next time I see them it probably will cost more than 12 bucks (Canadian that is) and I'll be more than five feet from the stage, but I can't wait. I encourage you to listen to and buy the album for yourself"
2,I think it worked fine?,"Got this flour in a timely manner. I had bought it for Alton Brown's Super Apple Pie. Shipping cost more than double the price of the flour and since I have found this flour at my local farmer's market for $2.00. It was an expensive mistake. I made the pie, the dough was tough. I'm sure to my inexpierence than the flour. The tapioca flour was fine, but shipping costly."
4,A very good book littered with typos and grammatical errors,"This book locates itself somewhere in between Francis L. Wellman's and Larry S. Pozner's books in the broader spectrum of useful learning materials which treat cross-examination as an art, by Wellman, and as a science, by Pozner. For the price alone, this book is a bargain. But if one is serious in ""learning"" the subject, Pozner's book is the way to go.Next time Davies revises this book, he should have it professionally edited before sending it to the printer. I have never seen a very good book (in fact, this book is so rich in substance) littered with so many typos and grammatical errors. It would be nice if a reader, who has not yet picked up this book, notes down all errors when eventually going through the book the first time, and sends the errata to the author for future publication purposes."
4,Shop elsewhere,"The product is decent, I have the Annakin and the Darth version and regularly engage in battles with my 7 y.o. son, but $85 is ridiculous. These things are fifteen dollars at the bullseye store, and only 20 at Sam Walton's. It's not enough these folks stick you for 4x the price, they have the audacity to charge shipping on top of it. Sheesh."
2,Disappointed,"I agree...they are very dark and cloudy. Also, one of the earring's back just slides right off. They were really small too. I guess they might be worth the price...too bad I bought them when they were $99."
1,PLASTIC SHOWER HEAD,"This item is a hoax! It is completely made out of plastic, not so called 'chrome', and it leaks! The install is simple, but the plastic material leaves much to be desired... the 84"" hose leaks from the top, so half of your shower water is gone before it hits the shower head. Wasted investment. DO NOT GET the ""deluxe hand held shower massage/3 spray chrome"" unless you're going for the tacky look."
3,Very disjointed,"Though it is not stated anywhere in the book, this appears to be a collection of short essays or articles strung end to end (either that or the author is singularly bad at writing transitions and staying on task). The book as a whole deals with the idea of worldview, focusing on the three major categories of Theistic/Christian, Transcendental, and Naturalistic.The various chapters/sections/articles fall into several categories:1. Making solid, insightful observation about the impact of worldview on how one lives2. Complaining about the current state of culture and education while offering mostly vague (or no) solutions3. Hyping Cedarville University (of which the author is the president).There were enough sections that fell under #1 that I am giving this three stars, but in my opinion there was a very disjointed feel to the book, and you had to sift through a lot of mediocre sections to find the good ones."
1,SIMPLY NOT RECOMMENDED,"How would one consider the best of one's artist if the songs here are mostly taken from just one album. I am a Cowboy Junkies fan, I got 12 out of their 16 albums, all of them aren't available in my own country. Why waste time purchase an album that even the band doesn't recommend? The band doesn't only put so much effort on their music, they also put a great art on their CD's label.I give this album a 1 rating simply for its unauthorized release."
3,stories don't make sense,"Most of these stories don't flow naturally. Story points jump around. And the pictures too often don't go with the story being told. Many of these ""read to me"" books will have something a bit off, but this is the worst offender."
4,great garage punk,"these guys are genuine. low tech , tuneful, funny , and this one's live-real -live. check out 'good bad not evil' and '200 million thousand'. great stuff"
3,Left open ends,"I'm a huge fan of Spader but this was not one of his best. Some parts of the plot was difficult to follow because it was boring and could not hold my attention despite Spader's hotness (haha). The problem I have with this film is the use of the ""Vietnamese"" woman to carry out the plot. Not only was it bad for the film, it gave Vietnamese viewers like me a bad taste in my mouth once the movie was over. The woman did not look like she was Vietnamese and she was just a medium to add sex and violence into the film. Plus, her fate was left untold after the trial. There's nothing realistic about this movie and Spader's character is not very likable though he's suppose to play the good guy. If you would like to see a good movie with Spader and the Vietnam situation, watch The Pentagon Papers. He plays a real hero in that one and it's based on a true story."
2,A formulaic and inept production,"A feckless, charmless, and morally vacuous man, haunted by the suicide of his father, runs for congress in Louisiana. His opponent, far ahead in the polls, nonetheless arranges an erotic encounter (in an abandoned aikido studio!) to get our hero's adulterous moves on video. Yawn. Everything--lines, camera angles, plot points--proceeds in the most predictable and utterly uninteresting fashion. Who gives a damn about this dissipated and rather fatuous pretty boy? Frost and Spader fail to bring any life to this yarn. Even Robards, a real pro, is off his game. Skip this one."
5,John Denver's greatest hits #3,"This John Denver CD is great, Lot of the best loved songs John sang, I recommend it to anyone...especially if you love John Denver. Great CD."
1,"Posts too thick, not comfortable","These earrings were very uncomfortable. I'm not sure if it's actually the size of the post so much as the shape and angle--more like an angled bar than a round post. I don't have particularly sensitive ears, although I generally don't wear large or heavy jewelry, either. These earrings are on their way back to Amazon.I also wasn't thrilled to see how much the price has varied. When I ordered--4/6/07--they were $34.99. Some reviewers bought them for less, yet the current price seems to be even more.Caveat Emptor"
4,"HAVE READ BETTER ""PREY"" BOOKS!!!!!!","Have now read the twelve books in the series. Chosen Prey is about James Qatar and his killing several women. He is a teacher and is rather hard to pinpoint. Lucus is back along with his crew, Del, Rose Marie, Sloan, and Marcy. They are looking for the killer but he continues to not be found. In this one I even figured out the ending before we got there. That is unusual for me to be able to do that. Think Sandford may be trying to wind up this series. The book list possibilities of Lucus moving on. I got a little tired of Lucus, Weather and the sex between them. I think the earlier Prey books were better. I still think my favorite is Winter Prey. If you have not read a Lucus Davenport book before please don't judge them all by this one."
3,Losing the edge?,"I've read all or nearly all of the Prey novels & found this one to be weak. The villian wasn't very compelling or evil. Lucas has gone soft.Sure Qatar was a killer, but he wasn't particularly riveting. I got no sense of why he was the way he was. It's implied that the killings happened suddenly but with 8 or 9 graves, it's clear it has been going on for some time. I hardly felt anything when he did in his own mother - it just fell flat. It's like he doesn't realize what he's doing - oops, killed another one. And the whole 'porn/art' angle was intensly focused on then hastily dropped - SCREAMED plot device. Very heavy handed, even for Sandford.And what is all this about a baby!? Way to dull your edge Davenport. And the political jockeying for position he's doing with Rose Marie...Puh-leeze. A few novels ago, Lucas would sooner have his eyes put out with a pick axe than pander to the policial element.What was good? The dialogue. The pace. But that's about it."
5,Lucas Davenport at his best,"Chosen Prey was the the second best in the series next to Winter Prey. I love the relationship that Lucas has with Weather and if he is smart he won't kill what they have. Sandford has a keen sense of letting you know what the killer is thinking and going through and now that he and his friends are going through the aging process it's even better. Despite his rough edges John has a soft side that is very appealing. Keep writing John, I can't wait for the next one."
3,Oh Well...,"Couldn't wait to read this Lucas Davenport story! But, I found this one a little flat. It just wasn't as suspensful as Sandford's other Prey novels. I thought the ""villian,"" James Qatar, was kind of boring. Even the ""will they, won't they have a baby"" story-line between Lucas and Weather was dull. Hope the next novel is back to the old Prey ways!!!!!"
3,"Difficult to read, but a worthy addition to your collection.","It's definitely one of the hardest books I've ever had to read. But more than likely intentionally, it manages to put you into the maddening frame of mind Batman must've been going through while at Arkham.I liked it, didn't love it though. I'll keep it and try to read it again another day to see if I missed anything worth putting it on my top ten list."
4,"A Bit Pretentious, But Still A Worthy Addition To Your Collection","So, incredibly, after being a life-long fan of Batman comics (and a long-time admirer of Dave McKean's work as well), I am only just now getting my hands on a copy of ARKHAM ASYLUM. My verdict? Well, on the bad side, it's more than a little bit pretentious - I occasionally got the impression that Grant Morrison wanted to show off his knowledge of Jungian archetypes and tarot card imagery and decided to come up with a story that would enable him to do that, rather than the other way around. On the good side, McKean's artwork is darkly gorgeous (as always), the story IS actually a pretty good one, and it's about as disturbing as mainstream superhero comics are ever going to get. In sum, it's a worthy addition to your graphic novel collection whether you're into the superguys-in-tights thing or not."
2,Too small.,"I have no issue with the story and art, it is a wonderful classic in my opinion, but this edition was too small for me to properly enjoy. I had to use a magnifying glass to read some of the text. Particularly the red text of the Joker. I feel like the text and a lot of detail could be better appreciated in a larger format."
3,Good history... bad ending,I was really exited because I thought this classic had an epic story..the history touch a psychological part of a broken Batman in some way it start really cool but it ends too poorly....Illustration are awesome very conceptual....
3,Good Art; Poor Story,"I liked McKean's artwork a lot when I first read this book but, returning to it today, the style seems overly familiar. In some places the level of darkness and number of symbolic artifacts seems to edge into self-parody.The basic story is very weak -- Batman walks about the asylum beating up his old enemies. The real emphasis is on how these villians illustrate parts of Batman's character. Personally, I found this less than convincing.Part of the problem for me is that I have a very low tolerance for paedophilia and torture, and much prefer detection-based Batman stories (such as The Long Halloween)."
4,Great,"Great graphic novel. I'm a big Superman fan and bought this for my brother, who likes Batman. Great price and awesome graphics. Plan on reading it soon."
1,Not even worth the time...,"So I must be honest and say that I bought this book after playing the video game in the series. And I must say, i'm hugely disappointed. I thought the book lacked any real story that I even cared to follow. It seemed to be reaching way too often for some very deep, emotional, psyche to come out of and really, it just made no sense. Plus, the real issue I had, is that it deviates from Batman as a character. I kept reading and saying, Batman would never do that, or that, or that. It was just very inconsistent for me and a total letdown. I wish I wouldve saved my 15 bucks."
5,Fantastic,This was an amazingly detailed graphic novel. It was rich in character development as well as story line. I strongly suggest that those with a craving for everything Batman buy this.
5,A Must for Batman Villain Fans,"Very unique art style, and it features so many villains - even some of the lesser-known ones. Honestly, that's the main reason I read it. I can't get enough of those Batman villains. If the Rogues Gallery is your favorite part of the Batman Universe, you appreciate mixed-media art, and enjoy exploring psychological allegories, you should check it out."
1,It would be less than one star as a rating,"If you are a huge batman fan then please do not read this book.- Batman shows little mental strength- Unnecessary parts and acts such as (SPOILER ALERT) pushing the wheelchair down the stairs.- Everyone at my local comic book shop tried to steer me away from the book, but the Amazon ratings still pulled me in. 19 times out of 20 they are right. Here is number 20. Most people that rated it highly probably don't have an actual quality Batman graphic novel to compare it to.Why you should read it:- If you are a Grant Morrison fan (I don't know why anyone would be, but okay)- The artwork is neat. Just neat."
2,overrated,dont buy into the hype. The art is garbage and the story is so short. Its under a ten minute read.
4,The story is very well done.,"The artwork is quite abstract. Sometimes it's a bit: "". . . . wait, what am I looking at"". But it's nice to have something very different from your average Batman comic. And I love how the story is quite serious. Books like this are a nice contrast to the fun, light versions of Batman like the Adam West or Animated Series tv shows."
1,A Very Disappointing Book,"This book looks great when you read the cover, and even the affirmations themselves sound okay. However, the author's supporting explanations reveal very poor exegesis and awful theological conclusions as a result. I would love to give this book zero stars if that were an option. This is a very unfortunate book that I would not recommend to anyone, unless they want an example of bad theology."
1,not for an active baby,"We have 3 other older children and had to start all over with baby items, so we recieved this as a gift. Our son has been very alert and active since day 1 and this seat was not for him. Every bath was hard unless there was someone to hold the baby in the seat, while the other person washed. Even if he wasn't moving or kicking he still would slide down and to one side or the other until his bottom was hanging off and toes where up in the air...in other words this thing doesn't work, And he did make use of all his lung powers(he's a screamer)he didn't like this seat at anytime during the newborn stage. He is almost 7 months now and has the bath seat that sits the baby up. Those seem to be the best and most safe, we have used them with all our kids."
2,Disappointed,"I read all the rave reviews, and decided to purchase this book. If I had glanced through this book at a store, I would not have purchased it. It does have a lot of food counts in it, but it's very hard to read. Every food item has smaller subcategories, and sometimes I'm not sure what to look under because there are so many categories. It takes me a while to look something up. The print is so small, it's similar to looking at a dictionary. I was also expecting more restaurants. There are a few fast food places (not many), and no ""sit down"" dining, such as Olive Garden or Applebee's. I will be looking for a different food count book."
2,"Good for some, but NOT for food weighers nor scratch cooks.","I found this a very frustrating book because it gives counts for volume measures of foods, but not very often for weights of foods. If you don't want to jam your yam into a cup measure to figure out its count, but want to weigh it on a scale, forget it. No by-weight counts for many (most?) common foods, e.g., apples, flour, oranges, yams. (There was a count for a 2.8 oz. carrot! Geez; mine was 3.7 oz.--hard to estimate.) Also, if you cook from scratch and don't visit fast food palaces, you will get sick of crawling through listings for lots and lots of fast and prepared foods (which probably have current counts on their labels anyway). Measurers, ball-parkers, and fast food folks may be happy. I wasn't."
2,"Not even close to ""Complete""","This book is probably fine for those who have absolutely no health risks. But for those of us who need to know sugars as well as total carbs, saturated fat as well as total fat, and soluble/insoluble fiber, it's not there. It's also really heavy on convenience foods--which have more info on their labels than you'll find in this book. You're better off on the internet."
2,I don't remember getting this,"guess I don't even remember this so ""not memorable"" If I don't remember it I guess that says it all"
4,Misleading Album Titles,"When Elvis' christmas recordings were reissued on CD, there was apparently some mixing and matching going on. While I totally love this CD, it is not the same one I listened to that my mom had on LP when I was little. It has several additions and omissions from that one, most notably the lack of ""If Everyday Was Like Christmas"". That song can be found on a CD of the same title, but the track listing of another one called ""It's Christmas Time"" by Elvis looks more familiar as the one I liked as a kid. Elvis' stuff is always great, though, so I still recommend this one, too."
5,One of the best,"This is really good for t v. Hard to believe. Not a soap opera. Everything about it surprised me. Now if they leave it alone for next year and don't do the ""new and improved"" thing."
3,Strike Back,I bought this DVD set Because my cable Company Doesn't carry Cinmax what fun if you miss 24 then this is a Great replacement lots of Military type shooting and different locations great fun
5,The Unit is Back!,"If your a fan of "" The Unit"" Then you will love this show. One of the best ive seen in a while, If you have doubts. Dont. Action packed, Great acting, Tactically sound, Will keep you waiting anxiously for the next season. Sit back, and Enjoy."
5,"Essential to own, Best Zeppelin Tribute Period the End - Shut up and buy it!","I am going to make this simple for you:Do you love Zeppelin?Do you like Tribute Albums?Do you Like Zakk Wylde?Do You Like Foreigner?Do you like Lita Ford?Do you like Bad Ass Rock N' Roll?If you answered yes to at least 2 of these questions, then you should buy this album.If you answered yes to 3 of these questions, you will love this album.If you answered yes to at least 4 of these questions then when you hear this album you will be pissed that you didn't get it sooner.If you answered all 6 with yes, you already own this album."
5,How Cheap is Cheap,Bought this as an extra print cartridge for my new HP D4260 printer. Was half of the cost of the same cartridge at Staples/OfficeMax. In fact its barely more expensive than third party refills. Just amazing.
1,Out of Ink ALREADY?,"I purchased this because I know my printer eats ink like there is no tomorrow (ungrateful brat :P).Ink usually lasts me around 2-3 months of school. This lasted only a few days, and all I printed were around 50 pages of mere writing (not even pictures).I'm pretty sure this isn't my printer's fault since this was a pretty ""large, wholesome meal.""Maybe it's just me, but I think I would rather just pay full-price at somewhere like Office Max or Staples (gee, that would have been Easy). It just isn't even worth the hassle buying something that will have to be replaced so suddenly.Anyways, I hope this review helps you. :)"
4,Works,Wanted to get the bigger cartridge but wasn't sure if it would fit.This one matched my previous cartridge and has successfully printed at least 1 page.
1,Didn't work,"We bought two of these printer cartridges for our HP printer and the printer would not recognize either of them. And to make it worse, we paid for second day air to get them here! Won't do that again. Based on that, I cannot recomend these cartridges. Buy them local!!"
3,Original HP (?),What I received was NOT an original HP product.It even says so on the package I received and when I installed it I received a message that it was not a HP product. While it seems to work ok it cannot tell me how much ink is left etc.so I get a message everytime I print something asking me if I want to cancel.
1,bug-ridden software,"The software running this unit is not up at ""appliance"" standard at all. The user interface locks up fairly easily (deadlocked threads?) and it fails to work as expected for situations just slightly off the straight and narrow. For example, recording a game off an MLB Extra Innings channel is likely to fail -- something about the feed to these channels being switched on and off causes the box to misbehave and delete the recorded game. (A workaround with about a 70% chance of success is to ""stop & keep"" the recording before the feed cuts out, then go to the list, select the game, and tell it to keep it again. You are out of luck until the end of the six hour game time slot if you want to watch TV after the game is over and the feed has already cut out -- anything you do will cause it to delete the recording.)I have purchased an R10 (TiVo-based) unit and will send the R15 one back ASAP."
1,DirecTV dropped the ball,"I agree with the consensus. I had nothing but problems with the R15 and aside from offering to replace it, customer service doesn't seem to have any other options. I saw one R10 (the old model with Tivo) at WalMart and dropped $100 to buy it and it works like a dream. I hope DirecTV and Tivo have resolved their differences in 3 years or so when I will need a new DVR or I may be switching to Dish Network. I've heard good things about their DVRs."
5,Unique bracelet,"The item I received is shaped more straight than pictured above. I was able to gently bend the wires so it'll fit my wrist better.It is beautiful and 'different'. It fits my wrist very well, and I am 5'2"", 110 lbs, and normally wear size 2 clothes. I do believe though, it'll fit someone up to size 8 or so as the wires are flexible. Hope this will give you a better idea of its size."
3,Not enough variety,"I have always enjoyed watching shows that dealt with cryptozoology and the unexlpained. I purchased two episodes of MonsterQuest season two on PSN (giant killer snakes and giant octopus) and found it enjoyable to watch with good production value. I bought the box set of MonsterQuest season 1&2 and I'm disappointed with season one. The show does a good job of using modern science to prove and/or disprove the ""monster"" of myth and stories. The show uses CG and reenactments to tell the stories of eye witnesses. Narration and the overall presentation of the shows were good, unfortunately most of the ""monsters"" from season one were uninteresting. Five of the episodes were about bigfoot from different continents. Two were about mutant dogs and black mountain lions which I didn't find interesting at all. Unlike in the '90s, shows like this are rare in today's TV programming. MonsterQuest season one showed potential but fell short of being entertaining due to the lack quality ""monsters""."
4,Monsterquest is okay,Can't say that I loved Monsterquest. They could polish the visual effects. It wasn't fascinating to watch the series. Maybe it is just me. However I will get season 2 and 3. Because show doesn't suck. It gives some info about the creatures of which I didn't hear before. I would recommend to get the dvd.
5,Hot grill,"After replacing the regulator that cane with the grill with this new one, the grill reached 400 degrees in a short time, something it never did before. Finally I have a hot grill."
5,hampton one,Works great....item is as listed and installation was easy.....better tban original equipment in a high end grill....Amazon is great as usual
4,PHILIPS Surround Sound Wireless Headphones HD1500,Everything great up fit is too tight and non-adjustable.
1,Just another novel featuring disfunctional people,"Having taught major American writers for 30 years, I can't get excited about the present trend toward disfunctional characters. I hope it isn't a lasting sub-genre. I lived in Gordon, the largest town of the county so am familar with the locale and find the setting greatly lacking in verisimilitude, but perhaps my reaction is because my deceased mother's name is used for the town gossip, Flossie Boyles. My mother, Flossie Boyle, of Gordon was not a gossip.I shall read again Mari Sandoz for good literature about Nebraska."
4,"Too neat, but a great read","I have always wanted to live in Kansas or the plains, go pheasant hunting, get into the air between the Earth and the sky. This book allowed me to do it without having to. Thanks to Tom McNeal. From a Hemingway scholar who loves the American novel set, unlike Ernest's work, in America, this is worthwhile."
3,A good start that slowed,"Knowing this book received the Michener award intrigued me enough to buy it. Although extremely detailed, I enjoyed the beginning of the book and made it 2/3 of the way through. But at that point, I was not entertained enough to continue, put it down, and have not completed it."
3,"Beautiful, sometimes bleak, definitely worth reading","This one caught my attention while browsing and I have added Tom McNeal to my list of ""must read"" authors. The story was a good one, the characters interesting enough to want to learn more about them. However, the story struck me as somewhat oddly disjointed, I'd find myself really enjoying it and caught up in the character (i.e. the adventures of unhappy Dorothy Lockhardt), only to be abruptly thrown into an unconvincing tale of Marcy's hiatus in an unbelievably portrayed Los Angeles. Overall, the story was a good one and I would recommend it. Tom McNeal shows terrific promise and I look forward to his next effort."
4,Hey Diddle Diddle Book,"Colorful design. Paperback, but a nice, strong cover. Only disappointment was that it was such a thin book. Only 32 pages. Did not have all of the nursery rhymes I was looking for."
4,Ready to make a pilgrimage to Trenton,"Okay, yeah, this wasn't the best of the Plum series, and the Eddie-DeChooch-getting-away-over-and-over plot got tiresome, but overall I still laugh out loud every time I read one of Evanovich's books, and how many authors can do that? Absolutely adored the ending, such that I would give Ms. Evanovich my eye teeth or maybe a kidney even just for the chance to read the chapter that picks up where Seven Up left off....whoo-hoo! So now I'm so curious about Trenton (a city I'd barely heard of before) that I'm tempted to mosey over there just to check it out!"
5,Great Stuff,"I found this 7th book in the Stephanie Plum series to be as good as the other six. And that is no small feat for the author to accomplish. Fresh material, good continuing characters, good new characters. Some serial writers use the same humorous phrases in more than one book, and it gets tiring. Ms. Evanovich does not. She is to be admired for really earning her praises for this highly, highly entertaining series. Now, to buy #8. Thank you again, Ms. Evanovich. You are tops!"
5,WOW! Plum is Back,"I have waited all year for ""Seven Up"". The wait was not in vain. This is a terrific, funny book. Janet Evanovich is in top form. I can't wait for number 8!!"
2,audio series should never change reader in the middle of the series,I really like the plum series but i just started listening to this one and i almost can't handle it! They switch the women reading the book to a woman who give the character a strong accent that she has never had before. I have no clue who is who in the book i don't recognize any of the main characters voices because they have all changed! I checked the next few books and they are read by CJ Critt (the original reader) and i can't wait to get through this one sor i can get on with the series!
2,Skip the CD this time,"I loved the first 6 Stephanie Plum novels on CD, but the reader of #7 is horrible. Her delivery is v-e-r-y s-l-o-w. It ruins the pace of the book. Also, she gives really strong accents (which are really bad, by the way) to everyone. Everyone EXCEPT Stephanie, the quintessintial Jersey girl. Stephanie sounds like a 50 year old midwestern matron."
5,Great!,"The book came on time and was well worth the order, the book arrived in great conditon, loved thequick shipping and attention to detail, a nice note was tucked into the box! thoughtful."
2,Seven Up Lost its Fizz,"I read the first 6 Stephanie Plum books in about 3 weeks and was kept intersted although the formula is repetitive. In this book the character Mooner is outdated and there is none of the suspense and tension of most of the first 6 books. Our dear Ms. Plum needs a change of scenery and plot. PULEEZZZ don't have her marry anyone...shades of a network sitcom. I'm hopeful S. Plum's adventures will return to form. At least with Grafton, ""Z"" is the end...with these, its infinity!"
2,Seven Up,The reader changes in this book. Thick accent. Too distracting for me. Sounds like someone from Housewives of New Jersey. If you like them you will probably have no problem with the reader. None of the characters sound the same so they lose their personality in the reading. I am sure there is a reason for this but...Why oh why change the reader? The only positive thing I can say is that I will know to avoid any audios read by Lorelei King. I even tried speeding up the play back so I could finish the book. Guess I'll skip to the last book in the series just to see how it all concludes...:-(
2,Not up to typical Evanovich standards,I have loved all of the previous Stephanie Plum books but I have to admit I was disappointed with this one. It didn't seem near as funny as the others. The plot was weak and the characters all seemed to be suffering from depression.I hope that this is just an aberation and that book eight will measure up to the first six.
4,Loved it.,The second book in this series is still my favorite but I enjoyed #7 and hated for it to be over. Now to begin the wait for #8.
2,What a Disappointment!,"Yes, like many of your other reviewers, I have read ALL of the books in the Stephanie Plum series. I even read this author BEFORE she created Stephanie and I really enjoyed her work. I think she was sleepwalking through this one. Her descriptions of the characters and situations were what made the previous books fun to read. This one is sorely lacking. For instance, there is a scene where Stephanie and Lula end up in the pit at a mud wrestling bar. I've never been to a mud wrestling bar so it's hard for me to come up with a picture of what it's like. More vivid and colorful descriptions could have made this a memorable scene. Instead, it comes across rather flat. Also, the author assumes that the reader already knows a lot of stuff about the recurring characters without filling us in. Poor Joe Morelli! He's relegated to the back burner in favor of the dog. C'mon, Janet, you can do much better."
2,Written like there was a contractual obligation.,"Obviously the stories and snafus are near identical each time, hence the Sue Grafton-like success, but this one comes off lazy and repetitive. As judged by the reviews, you can skip over this one."
3,A good but very quick read,"I really enjoy this series, they are entertaining and the characters are likeable. However, for $13 a hit for the kindle edition they add up very quickly as it only really takes a day to read one. It felt like I was a few pages in and it was already at 8% of the entire book. I wouldn't mind a bit more bang for my buck....."
3,Misses the mark,"Kelsey Grammer's 1995 book is a brisk and interesting, if somewhat shallow, memoir. The defining moment of his life was the horrific murder of his young sister, yet even here his prose is reminiscent of poster captions, always skirting real self-examination and having less depth than aPeoplemagazine story.Though he played the character of Frasier Crane for twenty years, that part of his life rates relatively little space. He devotes much more time to his early stage career and his romantic entanglements. He cavalierly dismisses his many girlfriends and wives as neurotic and needy, while taking no responsibility for the failure of any of his relationships.I still enjoy watchingFrasier, but after reading this book, the man seems a lot like his character - a self-centered elitist who sees himself through rose-colored glasses. I think a ghost writer might have written a more in-depth book."
3,A great read for 99 cents!,"An interesting read, especially for a book that I bought in the bargain bin for 99 cents. It wasn't written in a witty maner as I would have expected from Frasier, but a good quick read."
3,Made in china,"Looks nice when new, but doesn't last too long on a kid's hand, specially if he is a big fan of the series. Could be more durable and the ""woom sound"" also sucks on this cheapy version."
3,A little wordy.,"This book was hard to read, not for the lack of plot, but because of the author's constant attempts to impress with his vocabulary. Thanks to those attempts, the book became too wordy and tedious to read. A good editor could have cut the page count in half and never touch the story plot."
5,Excellent fun,I am a frequent traveler and carry this book with me everywhere I go. I play so many games I have to bring a half dozen of the books on each trip!
5,Finally something to do while I am waiting for my movies to download,"I was skeptical at first, but now I am sold. No more counting the ceiling tiles while waiting for my downloads to finish!"
1,Michael Birkins a liar,"Solitaire my ass. You are playing against Michael Birkin. And he is good. My record is 4-362. Whats next, Solitaire Battleship?"
1,A real page-turner!,Back and forth ... forth and back ... I can't keep up. My wrist is exhausted and I have about a dozen papercuts. This book is rubbish. And the plot is terrible.
1,Painful to listen to,"I like Dokken because of their melodic sense and Lynch's blazing guitar work. However, this was painful to listen to because of the weak vocals (strained at times) and Lynch's inability to pull off some of his memorable solos and licks. There's very much a feeling that they were unrehearsed and threw together a tour for some cash. I prefer Beast from the East as far as Live albums go."
1,Hair Fell Out,"I went to my hairdresser on January 5 and she suggested using the Olive Oil no lye relaxer. This is one of the biggest mistakes I've ever made in my life. Yes it makes you hair straight, to the point where you can see you scalp. Today is February 17 and I have still have bald spots. I have resorted to wearing a wig as my hair looks so terrible. I'm hoping that this STUFF will wear out of my hair and I will NEVER, NEVER, NEVER AGAIN have this STUFF put in my hair."
5,Definitely the best I've tried in 25 years,"On African American hair it is the best on the market. Does not leave the hair dry. Gives smooth bounce and somehow the hair feels healthier. I have tried every brand and will stick with this one. On my daughter's mixed-race mixed textured hair it took the dry curls to a beautiful 'S' wave. This was a wonderful surprise because she was hoping it would not be bone straight, and it turned out perfect for her. It relaxed it enough so that it is manageable but does not look as if it has been straightened."
4,It lets me know how to program in VC++.,"Before reading this book, I tried to understand how to do programming in VC++ but I failed. After I read it, I can do projects using VC++.I got a lot from the book."
5,The Uniqueness Myth,"The best aspect of this book was its readability. As someone who tends to cringe at the idea of reading dry and confusing books about the ins-and-outs of production, pricing and finance, I found this book to be refreshingly clear and straightforward. You can pretty much start at any chapter. In other words, if you're only interested in learning about marketing, you can go straight to that chapter and read up on it. If an issue on strategy calls your attention, you can read that chapter without feeling like you have to read the book cover to cover.I will definitely be using this book as a resource for years to come!"
2,Could have been great...,"Exploitation of human suffering??? This documentary overall was very poorly made. They could have taken this to a much more deeper level and created greater emotional connection to the issues that these guys were encountering, but the film came from a selfish perspective. A more proper title would have been, ""I haven't travelled much in my American life, now guess what I found!"" It assumes that the audiences that will see this film are somewhat ignorant to world issues and have no idea what COMPASSION means. It's as if they're pointing fingers to say, ""See! I told you! We're living the wrong way!"".... and this attitude really takes away from the film."
3,Out of my head,"Andrew Loog Oldham is best known as the manager of the Rolling Stones, but he has lead an interesting life outside of that. But of course, most people will want to read this book to get his memories of the Rolling Stones. Unfortunately for Stones fans, we don't get to his first meeting with the Stones until page 185. Also unfortunately, the book ends after his first year as the Stones' manager. I assume there is a sequel in the works. Anyway, the book is fairly interesting. It includes other people's memories of Andrew, as well as his own. Rolling Stones fans will probably like it, although they would like it better if it was entirely about his memories of the Stones."
4,Great game,"This is a great game for children and adults. It can be educational for children as they try to trip us the game, for my kids have started going through the dictionary to identifying items in the that could possibly trip up the game. Surpisingly, the same game also keeps the attention of adults with a litte humor."
4,Q20 mystifying madness,I first used a 20Q at a Bed and Breakfast and it was so cool that I wanted one when I came home. I ordered one on Amazon and it came right away. This one seems to be much noiser than the one at the B&B. We called the manufacturer and they said they were a bit noisy. This one also seems to stick on a question now and again. I think we might have gotten a lemon.
1,Poor Quality,Pool quality. Provide a better product and charge more for it already assembled.Probably my worst Amazon purchase experience ever. It will go in the refuse binat week's end
2,Damaged,"This stool is really cute. It went together fairly easily but the step part sticks and is hard to get open. The seat has a small tear on the side of the vinyl. I didn't see it until the whole thing was together and it was way too much hassle to take it apart and send it back. Overall, darling but poor quality."
2,Disappointed,"I read the other reviews, but should have really taken them to heart. I was SO hoping that this was like the one I had while growing up...therefore, I paid attention to the reviews that were positive. This seat/stool is probably fine for people who haven't seen the 'real' Costco Red Step Stools. But the seat itself is small--I am petite and my behind barely fits on it. After assembly, the construction is ""OK"", but not high quality.If you have expereinced the REAL Costco counter chair/step stools, you will be disappointed in this one."
1,"Poor Construction and design, not the real thing.","This Chair/stool has plastic parts in key locations that cause poor performance. The steps slide on a poorly conceived plastic rail that produce rough movement and frequent derailment that is difficult to repair. Retainers that guide the steps on the rail break easily. Original stool was solid, sturdy, and functional. This re-make is not."
2,Did Not Like At All,"My Grandmother had one of these in her kitchen and I can remember all the kids fighting over who got to sit on the stool at large family gatherings. I'm really sorry that I let her's get away from us when she died. I was so excited to see this stool on Amazon and could not wait to get it. But I returned it within less than 5 minutes of taking it out of the box. First of all it is a lot smaller than you think. My daughter's wooden highchair is larger than this stool. But what really made me dislike it is the color. To call it red is very misleading. I would say it was closer to orange, which doesn't appeal to me or match my kitchen."
4,Great addition to my kitchen,This stool comes in handy as seating(mostly for my cat) and just the right height so I can reach my recipe books on my tall cabinet. It was a little difficult to put the support brackets together though. I was actually looking for the same stool but with the seat being able to be lifted (just like my Gramma had).
2,Not like my grandma's,"This chair was fairly straightforward to assemble, but after one or two uses, the screws are falling out. Not at all satisfied with the quality."
5,"another ""wish list:"" item found and received.","I have wanted one of these for years. I put off because I didn't want to put it together. (I'm a 75 year old,alone). I kept looking for one locally. Guess what !!! It's already assembled... comes as you see it. Thanks so much."
5,Retro Chair/Step Stool,Great retro chair. Easy to assemble. Matches perfectly with my retro refrigerator. Would recommend to anyone who likes the retro look.
1,Bad buy,very cheaply made. leaned back against the back first time I sat in it and the screws pulled out and stripped. Can't be fixed. Not at all like the old fashioned ones. The screws around the legs keep coming out. The little steps are so flimsy I am afraid to step on them
4,Sitting well,"Cosco 11120RED1 Retro Chair/Step Stool, RedAfter hunting for this style of retro kitchen stool combined with steps to reach higher cupboards, and not finding anything in the UK, I ordered this via Amazon (dot com) and was delighted with the rapid and hassle free international service. The stool arrived quickly and in perfect condition. An earlier review prepared us for slight difficulties when putting it together, so that was very helpful, as it needed care and concentration. The finished product fits in just great. If I had a small niggle it is that the stool is rather lower than my previous stool, so doesn't work as well with my kitchen worktops, and to keep the steps down to just two (that slide out), it means that the first step is higher to step on to than one might expect - so needs a bit of extra 'umph' to get up on to it and then, likewise, when stepping down. But it works perfectly, and is an asset to have."
4,Red Retro Chair,The picture represented the picture shown. The product shown was shipped on time for my need of the item. It did take awhile to put together and do agree with other reviews that this chair seems 'cheaper' than the ones from the past.
2,Take them at their word!,"I took a chance and purchased this stool in spite of the predominantly bad reviews and, much to my chagrin they were right. The very cheapest of materials were used to manufacture it. It's much smaller than I imagined it would be and I doubt that I'll be able to use the stepstool part of it, as I had intended. I was very tempted to send it back during the assembly (the directions were nothing to jump up and shout about), but decided that maybe it would be okay once it was completed. It is flimsy and I don't think I'd have the confidence to stand on it. As it is, I think it will be used by my toddler granddaughter to sit up to the counter. To its credit, the color is very pretty and cheerful, but that's the only thing it has going for it."
2,Would not buy again,"Bought this for my toddler because she wanted to sit at the counter with mom and dad instead of her high chair. My biggest complaint is the steps do not stay in place when they are pulled out. Every time my daughter sits in the chair, she ends up kicking the steps back under the chair, and then she can't get down easily (or I'm constantly pulling he steps back out). Also, the material on the back is thin and not durable. We bought this in the fall and already have 3 little holes in it. Otherwise, the color is nice and assembly was not bad."
3,damaged,Box was practically distroyed ... the back rest was damaged and I am still waiting for the part ... 30 days. Will rethink in the future
5,Made Life Easier,"It's just perfect for me. I am disabled, can not stand very long to cook, it is the perfect height for counter work and at the stove. My kitchen is very small but it has room for the stool, so i'm able to turn sitting down to reach sink, counter and stove in one spot.It's very sturdy and I really like the red to match my decor. It's a must have."
3,Decent Movie...Average Transfer,"While I like the story I can't help but realize how weak the transfer is. I don't mind a little film grain, but this was rather annoying. I have watched the film in both DVD and Bluray and have to admit that the DVD was less annoying.Well the story is...cute. Don't know another way to describe it, yeah for love triangles. Had some decent action scenes, which one would expect from this genre, but the pop music would really throw me off. Give the movie a chance, it's cheap enough to not piss a person off for buying it."
2,should have read the other reviews,"Some of the scene's were amazing, like the ice cave scene. The movie followed two girls doing research. I wanted more caves, and exploring them. This was pretty lame. The 2nd graders, made me think I was watching the magic school bus. If they would have shown more ""AMAZING"" caves then it would have been better."
2,"An early Dick novel, and not a particularly successful one","Written in the early 1950s, this novel takes place in 1949 in post-revolutionary China and concerns three Americans, two men and a woman, who have remained to hand over control of a factory to the new government. One of the men, Carl, a boyish innocent, falls in love with the woman, Barbara, who is cold and emotionally repressed, and happens to be the ex-lover of Vern, the other man. The working out of this triangular situation is told rather tediously, with many flashbacks to minor incidents. The subplot of the political takeover of the factory is not well integrated with the romantic theme. Despite the vividness of some scenes, there is a meandering slackness to this novel, undoubtedly the weakest of Dick's mainstream works."
3,Balzac is better--but the movie is uniquely alluring,"Very offbeat--a movie you won't soon forget. A little awkward in spots, even laughable if you watch it in a group or late at night, but otherwise not bad. The Balzac novella it was based on is an ingenious piece of writing that defies replication, and in my opinion Currier's interpretation has a very different focus than the literary master intended. But if you like movies that appeal to your darkest subconscious drives, this movie is a deeply sensual experience that is still tasteful enough to offend only the most conservative of viewers."
5,A TRAGEDY BASED ON A WONDERFUL SHORT STORY BY BALZAC,"This is a wonderfully filmed version of a wonderful short story by Balzac. In the story, we ""hear"" an old soldier reminisce about a terrible episode in his life--how he became friends with a wild panther (black leopard) in the desert and how that friendship came to a tragic end. (By the way, there are not many prose narratives that have the ""form"" of literary tragedies, so Balzac's story is a very rare thing and is well worth looking up and reading.)The spirit of the original story is kept in this film, and the overall impact at the ending is the same. I have recommended this film to many of my friends who teach literature, and I don't know of a single one who has been disappointed by it.Among the bonus features is material about how this film was made--using a very dangerous array of leopards."
5,One of my favorite films,"When, oh when will this haunting, memorizingly beautiful film be available on DVD -- the only format outside a theatrical showing that can do it justice? For those who love stories you can get lost in, and enjoy pondering the boundaries between reality and myth, this is for you. NOT a movie with a fast action plot, or lots of dialogue, but has its own rewards."
2,Could not wear them,"These earrings are lovely, obviously good quality, but they have an odd design on the post that made them painful to wear for me. The post widens near the hinge, so it stretches the ear hole. I had to return them. With a different post, I would recommend them. As they are, I would not them at all."
1,Very bad printing quality!,What I received is really bad one. Parts of this poster were white which were not painted!I gonna throw it into trash can!
4,A nice sampling of Miller's magic...,"I think this is a nice one-disc presentation of the Miller Orchestra. The booklet notes are not much more than the minimum, but the music will put you ""In the Mood."" A few of the tunes have vocals, and the sound quality is pretty good, but not ""remastered."" Anyone interested in quality American popular music should have at least one Miller CD. Read the various reviews, look for the disc that has your favorite songs, buy with your budget in mind----but Miller stuff can stand up to repeated playing and is great background while you do household tasks."
3,"Nice book, but let's be clear about Patanjali...","Reviewer Michael Charles quotes Bikram as writing, ""These are the classic Yoga Postures handed down from Patanjali's Yoga Sutras.""Only 3 of Patanjali's 195 yoga sutras are devoted to asana (posture) and they are about attitude rather than descriptions of actual postures.Be wary of anyone who tells you that his or her yoga is the ""true"" yoga as delineated by Patanjali. (Bikram is not the only yogi who makes this claim).I have nothing against Bikram, his methods, or this book--in fact, I enjoy Bikram Yoga classes. I just wanted to point out this misleading claim."
5,worth it!!,"I started at a hot yoga studio doing yoga for the first time but we moved out of the area and the local hot yoga studios are not the best. I found this book and it's been great to use at home as a replacement. I have only been doing yoga for 4 months and in these several months my migraines, leg aches, sleep, allergies, and overall self esteem has dramatically improved!"
3,sometimes...,"for a friend, this method is a godsend and he will bless me until he or i die! but for me, i hurted my back and had muscle flabiness after practicing it for more than a year, faithfully, regularily and earnestly..."
5,Every Bikram student should have this book,"This book is an excellent reference for Bikram Yoga students. Much of the text appears to have been transcribed directly from Bikram's classes, so there is quite a lot of fun banter between him and his students. There is also detailed instruction and photographs of each pose, so you can get a clear idea of how each asana is supposed to look when done properly.The studio instructors sometimes go very quickly through the poses and dialog, so this book offers a good opportunity for you to fully understand the entire sequence of 26 poses and answer any questions you might have about how to properly perform the asanas."
2,Jake gettin' slooowwww!!,I zapped the audiobook on this one because Jake Grafton is one hero I could like from Flight Of The Intruder and on. But....Admiral Grafton? Ugh. Dirk Pitt he's not and the entire sub/satellite/computer whiz plot themes seem tired and bordering on the mundane. It took Jake and Toad way too long to figure out what the heck is going on and I ended up shouting clues in the car. Too clever Russians with too sadistic Germans with too stupid Americans was just toooo... much.
4,billy miles review,"I never heard of this artist, until I heard it on public radio interview flipping thru dials at night on the way to work. I fell in love with this album. It's different. I hate top 40 thats played 40 times a day. I like rock/metal/Rap/hip hop and this was something I had to have. It's not defined by any of the above. IT's a mix of hip hop,r+b,and with some sounds of what I think is the 1930's or 1940's. Kinda grooving music. Interesting. Some people may not like the sound of her voice, but I do as long as you don't over play it for weeks on end."
1,Where are the birds?,"Many of Florida's most interesting or unusual birds are missing from this book. Whooping cranes, Limpkin, Red cockaded woodpeckers, all of special interest and missing.Aracaras and Snail Kites are also missing. This is a potboiler."
3,Useful information though out of date,"CCNA exam objectives have been updated since 2000 when this study guide was published. While this information is still relevant, additional resources should be used when preparing for the current CCNA exam (640-801)."
2,I bought this album and I'm NOT TOO DAMN HAPPY,"I know that Aretha is the Queen of Soul (we're constantly told that by certain media pundits) but this album is not a testament to royal talent.Aretha sounds tired in some spots and under-inspired in others. Her voice is still appealing--tho it has deepened and rusted abit with age. Her style remains as catchy and addictive as ever with the whoops and ""souls"".Still, the songs are nothing special and the album is not a watermark album at all. And the professional critics have been less than impressed.Question: A TRUE DIVA and one who doesn't consider herself royalty? Answer: Barbra Streisand--the most successful female recording artist in history. Barbra's Movie Album shows how a mature artist can still be inspired and sing as brilliantly as ever!"
2,Dull Perfomance,"When buying a live DVD, I like to get a performance! That is exactly what this DVD does not have.Don and George give a very lackluster performance, and Jeff Pilson's energy is not enough to save the show. It's a very bare-bones show: minimal lights, the stage is almost always just dark. There is no cinematographic creativity. This could have been produced for a breakfast show on a community TV channel. In Brazil.I love love love Dokken, and George is one of my major influences as a guitarist, but this DVD is really below par.Unless you're a rabid fan who wants to make sure your collection is complete, avoid this DVD. The audience looked more bored than I was. It took me three months to watch the whole thing - I just couldn't do it in one sitting."
4,Awesome DVD- Dont listen to the naysayers,"Ok, the dvd isnt perfect, (like live from the sun is), but it is what it is, live concert footage, not some pre packaged mtv crap. I know that i did hear some amp hummmm type noise during one of the ballads, alone again? not sure, but the video and audio quality is very good. the people who are bashing it must have gotten defective copies, because it sounded and looked great running thru my sony flat screen and home stereo setup. If you are a Dokken fan, this dvd is a must have, george lynch was awesome, played his green serpent guitar for most of the show but used 3 others on various songs, he simply went nuts on mr. scary. Get this dvd, dont listen to the crap that people are smacking about it, this is a great hair metal dvd."
5,"Itty bitty, very cool!","I bought the aspic cutters to make details in snowflake-shaped cookies and they were great. My cookies looked beautiful and I had a blast playing around with all the shapes. I also found that the cutters were perfect for making teeny sugar paste ornaments for a big Christmas tree that I made out of marshmallow/rice cereal molded in a traffic cone (not an original idea, saw it on a Food Network Challenge). These cutters are going to get a real workout -- but not on aspic!"
1,Worst Klimt Book I Have Ever Purchased,"If I could give it ""zero"" star rating, I would. Being an aficionado of Klimt, I may be as bold as to conclude that Comini's book is: a) expensive without offering any new angle/insight/pictures compared with the cheaper Taschen series; b) absent of any informative text (only a few pages in the form of a prologue); (c) colour-printing was very shoddily done.This is the only book I had ever returned to Amazon...so save your time/postage and get instead books with really gorgeous and rare prints like Abrams' ""Gustav Klimt"" or Fischer's take on ""Gustav Klimt and Emilie Floge""."
1,Complete Waste of Money,"A major disappointment. Other reviews made it sound so helpful, but when I received it, I found it was a slim volume of forms that anyone could make in two minutes. Do you really need to pay money to buy a sheet for listing scenes? Buy a bunch of index cards. Works just as well and a whole lot cheaper."
2,Black Lotus,"OK--I've liked the Sano Ichiro novels. I even struggle to overlook MAJOR inaccuracies in Rowland's characterizations of Edo period Japan. I have after all heard of ""poetic license""...But enough is enough! After reading it and being somewhat insulted by Ms. Rowland's characterizations of Japanese Buddhism, her historical inaccuracies of starting a ""new"" Buddhism during the Tokugawa Era are just unforgiveable to anyone who knows anything about feudal Japan. Not bloody likely! I did pick up the next book in the series, and could tolerate the glaring inaccuracies there somewhat better.The plot is in this one is as-predictable as the descriptive phrases that she uses over and over from book to book to bring ""character"" to them. I swear she has them stored in ""auto complete"" in her Word program! I do sincerely wish she would come up with some new material because I enjoyed Shinju, inaccuracies and all. Maybe if she kills off Keiko and lets Ichiro back out more?"
2,Addresses and map locations don't match,"I haven't read the book in detail yet but so far I've found that the addresses that are listed do not match the map locations that the book indicates. I don't know whether the addresses are wrong or the map location is wrong - but several of the hotels are listed for a particular map location where they clearly are not (NE address in the NW section of Portland for example). I'm not too confident about getting myself around using a book that has glaring errors. If I can find errors in an initial read, I can only imagine how many less noticable errors there are. I guess I'm going to be doing lots of additional research to see where things really are... And next time I'll stick with Lonely Planet guides."
2,scratched up,14k Yellow and White Gold Crossover Hoop Earringsverry nice looking scratch marks on one earring will not buy no more jewery on line.will be trashed
5,Earring Purchase,"I don't love earrings period!! But my Wife sure does. She says they are beautiful!!!The Lone Haranguer AndHis Faithful Canine Companion,Curly, The Silver Bullet"
5,VERY Pleased,"I bought these for my wife and it's the first time I bought jewelry over the Internet. I took a chance because I trust Amazon. I was extremely pleased with what I got and, more importantly, my wife loved them and hardly ever takes them off."
2,not for serious poets,"I'll give this book two stars: one for the excellent lay-out (the pictures and the quotes and the basic way the book is presented), and another one for the poems that were done by seasoned poets. The rest of the poetry that was published in this anthology is by teens and it is HOR-EN-DOUS! HORRIBLE! This is definitely a good one for, like, 10-16 year olds, but even so, not if you really are a serious poet and, at least, know what poetry is all about."
5,Next Best Thing to Being There,Dr. Halfpenny delves into difficult and complicated issues revolving around the wolf reintroduction and subsequent survival. He makes the science involved easy to understand and is patient with the reader. Dr. Halfpenny continously makes the reader understand these are wild animals and should be treated and studied that way. But he also allows for the fact that people are interested.The study involved in this reintroduction has been astonishing. I would love to have seen more on the politics of the reintroduction and hope that Dr. Halfpenny continues to be involved in the wolves of Yellowstone.Reading this book after a tough day will allow you to experience some of the wilderness and nature that we all need. I was especially moved by the Yellowstone Association class that got to touch the wolves. I would have a similar experience to what those people did if I ever had that opportunity.
5,Recognising Emotional Unavailability Just Became Easier,"Dr Bryn Collins has written a marvellous book about recognising patterns and styles of people who are emotionally unavailable. She writes a very descriptive picture at the start about what it really is like to be with an emotionally unavailable person - and it's just so ""spot-on"". Dr Collins describes each of the types of emotionally unavailable people using very real examples for each type. Dr Collins also goes on to give you tools for changing and growing and helping you recognise the ways you may be emotionally unavailable. I *love* this book. It should be part of all school's curriculum!! Great work Dr Collins - this is one of the best book's I have read. And I did read it from cover to cover; something I have never done with any other book!"
3,Is it Aspergers?,"While I identified my husband in this book, I later found out that he has Asperger Syndrome. Counselling would not work for him but would work for me. I got help for myself and found out why I was attracted to such a man. He got a diagnosis and I learnt how to communicate with him as an Asperger Man. We are still married and happily so. I have addressed my issues and he is a happy. Despite his Aspergers, he tries hard to be a good husband. I understand everything about the condition now and that has saved us. In my case, yes he is emotionally unavailable as I knew it but when I look at him in terms of Aspergers, I can see he loves me very much."
1,"Put out something new, then I might agree with you.","I live for today not yesterday.Translation: RELEASE A NEW BLOODY ALBUM ALREADY! You're almost as bad as Boston or Leonard Cohen!Signed,epsteinsmutha"
5,It works!,"My dog, a pit-bull-labrador mix, likes to bark. I can sit in the house and blow this whistle, and she will immediately stop barking and come inside. If you're expecting a ""silent"" dog whistle, this isn't it, but I'm not sure that there really is such a thing. It can be heard, but it's very quiet. I doubt that my neighbors ever hear it. I'm happy with it."
2,it is not silent,"It should not be advertised as ""Silent"" dog whistle. It is not silent. Other than that the quality seems to be all right."
1,Don't bother,"Don't bother with this ""ultra-sonic whistle."" It's a good emergency whistle, not a silent, dog training, whistle.This product did not work."
1,NASB Study Bible,.The Bible contents are good. The provider sent defective Bible and not according to product details.Does not assume responsibility. Combative.
5,The best Bible for the price!,"I prefer the NASB for study, and this is the best study Bible for the price I have found. I have been giving this Bible to new members in our church and they have really enjoyed having commentary and other info they can understand."
5,Excellent resource,This Bible has many great features to make your study of the Bible so much more enjoyable.
3,Wish it was leather,"I thought this Bible would come with a leather cover, but it doesn't. It's a printed hardcover that isn't particularly attractive. The pages are also very thin."
4,Not just for old geezers any more . . .,"This is one that's been around and is coming around. Tired of the crap Axe and similar scents marketed at the ""younger"" crowd? Want something a tad mores sophisticated? I get more ""Mmmm . . . you smell nice . . . "" from girls when I'm wearing LV than almost anything else.Some people complain it smells vile in the bottle, so they don't want to try it on their skin. Well, it does. But moments after hitting the skin, it transforms into a great outdoorsy scent, even a bit musky . . . do yourself and your ladyfriends a favour and pick up a bottle of LV!"
3,At least put it on before deciding,"Straight of the bottle this stuff does smell like a Port-a-Potty. I decided what the heck I'll try it and about 30 minutes later all that is left is a light floral scent. I won't order it again though, I'll stick with the Clubman - a far superior fragrance."
1,Dummies is right,I bought this book after seeing a story on TV about doing research on the Internet of genealogy. I know less after reading the book then I did when I started. It was written by dummies all right.
5,An important topic,"A fantastic book that outlines the field of Palestinian archeology. How successive generations of the decendents of Ka'annan lived off the same land. How history destroys a people when it is written by outsiders & unchallenged for 2000 years & finally adopted in tragic irony by the very people it eventually dispossesses. It is therefore fitting that the founder of Palestinian archeology, Albert Glock, is a non-Palestinian who was probably murdered by a Palestinian. Face the facts: the Israelis didn't do it. It is the obscurantism of religion that is at the heart of the Palestinian problem, of the ""Holy Land"" Archeology problem and the murder of Albert Glock."
4,Good...,"All I have to say is-I've read it, and it's good, but I recommend this book's original version- Palestine Twilight. For some reason, the title was changed when it came to America, and some elements were edited out."
2,20Q Green a Bummer,Performance of this toy is far inferior to the demo on the web site. It's vocabulary is much too limited.
1,Not recommended,This has been printed too many times and blown up too large. The quality of the image is very poor.
5,No need to rush,"The best part about ""Chapter After Chapter"" is that Sellers assures writers that they are not alone, and that great works need time to create. This may not be the book for those who are into the ""novel in 30 days"" school, but it does offer a perspective that can help bring one up to speed. The book is a winner, a sigh of relief.Update: I've been re-reading this book until now, months after I first picked up the book. I may sound like a gushing high-schooler, but I can't believe that a book can reassure me the way ""Chapter After Chapter"" does. I'm almost done with the writing of my next graphic novel, and Heather Sellers' words help keep me going.I always go back to her impressions about dealing with writer's block, warding off tempting new story ideas and learning more about the craft. When it comes to writing projects, I have a hard time finishing what I start, so her musings about having a relationship with your book are dead-on."
5,Need for Speed Most Wanted review by IXXY,"Need for Speed Carbon, not very good and at times boring. Need for Speed Pro Street, well if you bought that game hope you like it, but I myself need a Need for Speed game thats more exciting, more law breaker and less corporate backed. Basically I need a game with a soul. Need for Speed Most Wanted saved me during my first couple months in Iraq. Trust me if you remember what it was like to play Need for Speed III Hot Pursuit (AWESOME GAME BTW) This is the game that you have been waiting for and will tide you over until Need for Speed Undercover (EA This had better be What Carbon was supposed to be A REAL PT.2 to Most Wanted) comes out. Hands down one of the best arcade racers on 360 to this day. Crush the blacklist, dodge the fuzz, and get your rep up! Need for Speed Most Wanted gets a well deserved 10 out of 11 HIGHLY RECOMENDED!!!"
3,Doesn't exactly stand out....,"Eh, this game is average. It's not addicting to me, and the graphics(on a standard non HDTV) are only okay. I would rent this first to see if you enjoy it, and if so, by all means buy it!"
2,Not Dimmable,"They are bright, but they do not work in my dimmers. They go out when you try to dim them. Oh, well, they are cheap"
5,Just what I wanted and delivered,Just what I wanted for my kitchen as we eat occasionally at a high counter but use the step stool to access the higher cupboards. Easy to put together Good price
4,step stool review,"The step stool, a gift for my daughter, works well as a step stool. The problem was in the difficulty to attach the seat and back to the stool. The frame did not meet and had to be bent to align the screws. There was a hole in the box and the screws fell out, so my daughter had to request the screws before she could put it together."
1,What a piece of junk,"This step stool is not remotely ""vintage"". It is a cheaply made product that looks like ... a cheaply made product. The back was not straight and the legs were uneven. I was able to return it because of amazon.com's excellent return policy, but I highly discourage anyone from buying this piece of junk."
4,Delightful,"Watched The Fledermaus with friends over New Years eve, and we were totally entertained by delightful singing. The cast mesmerized us, and we were actually part of the Orlovsky party! The only thing missing was the quadrille we all waited for. Loved it!"
4,It works,"Aside from the great music, clever, interesting libretto, 'Chess' takes a subject that is obscure and unknown to most people and puts everything from the opening ceremony, to the love interests, to the defection of a Champion, and presents it in a really captivating manner that a broad audience would like. Unfortunately, some staged productions didn't play to these strengths, but this original cast album does."
5,I love this musical!,"I am a big fan of the original Broadway recording of Chess. It's fantastic. I absolutely love ""No Contest"" which is missing in the London version. I especially love this one line ""DON'T EVER TELL ME I DON'T KNOW THE WAY TO PLAT IT!"" It is sung with startling emotion. This is great music, and the performances are awesome too.

2,Good but about 10 years too late,"I have been a long-time radiohead fan and, like many others, have been waiting patiently for a live DVD. So I was thrilled to find out they released one and immediately bought it without even looking at the setlist. It never occurred to me that they would release material that is nearly 10 years old!I couldn't help being disappointed when I watched this DVD. The constantly changing camera angles and general lack of concern for the song itself make this unpleasant to watch. In fact, I only watched it once and it has since been gathering dust. I know I would have enjoyed it much more had it come out when the songs were still in their prime.I've always that Radiohead was modern, progressive, and totally innovative. I appreciate their old music but they have come a long way since pablo honey... and it doesn't help that before every song, Thom mutters ""this is a new one."""
4,'Still Here' a dear friend on a dark sojourn made light,"I purchased ""Still Here"" at the Pittsburg airport enroute to my brother's funeral. Throughout the weekend as I prepared to lay my brother to rest, Ram Dass' exploration of aging, change and death was with me every step of the way. It is about letting go, accepting, meditating and dispelling fear of aging, change and death. I found it a wonderfully life-affirming book and very informative. It was like having Ram Dass beside me, in his wheelchair, saying every once in a while throug the silence of my mourning, ""Ah, and now this..."" Thank you Ram Dass. This book is highly recommended, but please materialists and realists may need to find succour elsewhere."
2,"Ok, But Incomplete","Six pages, including a cover and a table of contents, and four pages about HP-UX. Contains a listing of top-level operating system directories and some commands. Some commands show only syntax, while others show only examples - a combination of syntax/examples/brief explanations would have conveyed the material better. The material which is there is ok, but there is a fair amount which is conspicuous in its absence. I would recommend inclusion of the iostat command, and an explanation of hardware paths, in future editions."
1,No Help,"I ordered this to try on my toddler son's horrible eczema. It did absolutely nothing to help. I had read reviews and about half said it helped, half said it didn't so I thought it was worth a shot. Unfortunately, with eczema everyone is different and finding what works is a lot of trial and error. Definitely error for us with this product, although it could be helpful to someone else."
4,Anything but typical in your face Death Industrial,"Since I am able to have exceptional access to rare and extrem walks of music, I jumped at the possiblity to view this release. It is definate inprovement from the last. It completly fills the urge for blunt heavy Industial. Since I am always on the search for a new fix I hope the wait for the next albume isn't long. Combining rave floor trance with the sickest lyrics south of Colorado Puncture is a force to be recond with. Untill the release of my deepest darkest secret Signal 7, due out in the early winter months 2000"
2,Rubbish AI; An Exercise in Frustration,"Video games are supposed to be accessible for everyone -- someone should have told this to Tecmo, who have bogged down what would have been a delightfully fun fighting game with the cheapest, most abusive AI I have ever seen. Though the game is beautiful, fast, and frenetic when playing with a friend, trudging through the game's single-player mode -- the only way to unlock more goodies and characters -- is horrific. The game's AI is so cheap to the point where random button mashing is the only way to go. The computer relentlessly punishes you for attempting throws, reversals, or even BLOCKING. I won't even get into the final boss, which made me launch my wireless controller across the room multiple times. After 20 years of game-playing, nothing has ever frustrated me as much as this.Avoid like the plague, unless you like a challenge and enjoy blowing sixty bucks on a game that will abuse and humiliate your playing skill at every step of the way."
2,what the hell !!!,"We all seem to be missing the big point with this game, after spending hours trying to unlock stuff, costumes and such the game delete its memory,damn that's anoying."
1,It Sucks!,"I bought this remote for my InFocus 70+ projector. It never worked. The company told me to keep it and keep trying to get it to work. First they told me to change the batteries. I changed them 10 times. Then they told me to clean the LED's to make sure they weren't dirty. That didn't work. Then they told me to stand directly in front or behind the projector. That didn't work. I kept telling them it wouldn't work. The only thing that worked was the power button - it does turn the projector on and off. Then they told me to contact InFocus to get a software upgrade. It doesn't exist for Windows 7. This projector is old and they did not have any updates beyond Windows XT. After the return window had passed, they wouldn't take the product back because it was too late to return it. That sucks because the product NEVER worked but they insisted I keep it and keep trying until I could not longer return it. DO NOT buy this product."
2,boring,"hha the best part of the video is whn thy interviewed tank ...haha he was wasted. the rest of the movie is pretty [not good], i wanted to see that gorilla looking guy ""ruas"" get taken out by remco. him and those ... leg kicks like he was scared to get close to varelas.i liked olegs style tho probabaly cuz he was fighting against one of the most boring fighters to watch, shamrock.i guess if u like to see guys hugging on the floor get this but i like more of a bar fight style."
5,great for early teens,"Finding gifts for early teenagers is difficult- this is the perfect gift. My son turned 12 right before Christmas, we set it up in his bedroom. When he has friends over, the boys who are not on Playstation have something to do!"
1,Book still not here after a month!,"Amazon asked me to review this book, which is funny, considering I still haven't received the copy I ordered more than a month ago! If you really want this book, you might try getting it elsewhere."
3,Not the best copy for a new dvd,"Purchased as new, was sealed and disc did not have any scratches. However I made a VHS copy of this movie back in 1993 from a Showtime broadcast at the fastest (sp) speed and still have it. The dvd I just watched was inferior to that old copy. The picture was grainy and dark and the audio was too low. It was'nt even letterboxed. True it had small thin black bars at the top and bottom but on a true widescreen the bars would be very thick, like the ones on TCM. It's a terrific movie though. The soundtrack alone was worth the price of the dvd. I wonder though how an 8 year old boy living out in the middle of nowhere would automatically know where the gas filler was on that old Cadillac. And the very end, when he is screaming at the sky went on a little too long. Overall I still highly recommend it but hope the copy you see is better quality than I got."
4,Sturdy construction but difficult to use,After my shepherd puppy destroyed the first E collar after surgery I ordered this one. It is much better constructed in terms of the flexiblity and weight of the material. The only negative was that the use of plastic clips to close the collar rather than velcro made it almost a 2 person task to place the collar on our dog.
5,Operation Gatekeeper,Very well-documented. A useful and must-have source for anyone interested in Southwestern U.S. border enforcement issues.
2,Liberal bias wrapped in a pseudo-cloak of objectiveness,"While the author tried to maintain an air of fairness and objectiveness regarding the many controversial issues surrounding border enforcement, a subtle, liberal bias tainted his entire presentation. The conclusions were already made before the words were written; it is obvious that supportive facts were selectively picked.This book has less original thoughts than you might think. The author looked at the ""medium"" picture and told us it was the ""big"" picture. Either he doesn't know the difference or is trying to promote his social agenda.In our new era of concern over national security, this argument doesn't fly.Don't waste your money on this one!"
4,A Stellar Collection of Contemporary Fiction,"Red Hen Press is a small nonprofit based out of Los Angeles. Knowing that, I wasn't expecting this anthology to carry so much literary weight. From Tobias Wolff's ""Nightingale"" to Lore Segal's ""The Talk in Eliza's Kitchen"" and Robert Olen Butler's ""The American Couple,"" these diverse stories are surprising, evocative, and reveal countless dimensions of the human experience."
3,Underrated and Fun,"This is a tight little thriller that you might have missed. Somehow it missed at the box office -- though it didn't bomb -- but this movie manages to create suspense and doesn't drive you crazy with plot inconsistencies. I don't know if it's worth buying, but it's a very enjoyable movie. Just as good as the cameo by Seagal is the supporting turn by the scene-stealing Oliver Platt. END"
4,Very watchable movie,"I am no longer using the VHS player to watch movies and now that after the WTC attacks IT REALLY EERILY parallels the the plot in this movie - I had to get the DVD!!In the real world the terrorists used the planes to attack us.In the movie the terrorists wanted to use the plane to attack DC but enough to take out the eastern seabord!In the real world, 4 planes were used to attack NY and DC!In the movie most of the terrorists were middle eastern and they had planned to go back to Algeria.In real life, Algeria is known to have state sponsored terrorists!In the movie, the terrorists were islamic radiacals.In real life they were!!"
4,"Cheap, handy wire stripper","This is not a heavy duty wire stripper, but it feels well made and strips the wire as it should. I used these to strip speaker wire for my house. I used the setting wheel to set to 14 gauge and it worked fine. The only thing I would change is making the setting wheel notched or lock into place, because sometimes when I would set it down the setting wheel would turn so I'd have to adjust again."
3,Amateur stripper says: meh.,"I'm no wire-stripping pro by any means, but even still I expected an easier time with these. I used them to strip a bunch of 16 gauge speaker wires, and it was a giant pain. I had to adjust the setting constantly- either stripping away too much or too little- and I accidentally changed the setting a few times (easy to do accidentally) and wrecked a few wires. On the plus side, I did eventually finish the job. And this is cheap. If you are a stripper that has been around the block a few times (if you know what I mean), maybe these will be up your alley."
1,Broken On Arrival,"Because of the sloppy manufacture, it doesn't actually close. You have to use your other hand to push it apart enough. This makes it basically worthless, as it's more effort than just using scissors or something. Complete disappointment."
4,My son adores Thomas.,"My 3-year-old just adores Thomas and his friends. Personally, I find Ringo Starr and George Carlin to be the best narrators in this series. This DVD is completely inoffensive for young children. All the trains are a bunch of prissy old queens who fight and then learn to get along. As an adult, I find Thomas about the same as Barney. Annoying to me, but fine for my son who is learning to be nice to his little sister and gets the message partly through the trains learning to get along."
2,hardly any tint,"Pros-very comfortable, cheap price.cons-does not block out enough light or shade very well. These shades do not work well at all in very bright sun. On the the product tag it says something to the effect of ""does not distort colors"" etc., but in doing that you will still find yourself squinting in bright sun. There is really hardly any tint at all with these shades."
3,"Used to be a good deal, not anymore",These used to be around $13.00. At that price they were great and I bought three pairs. Now they're over $18 (almost a 40% increase) and there are better deals to be had...
3,DisTorTioN,"The lens polarizes well but it has distortions resulting in ""funny vision"" as one eye sees in focus, and the other has a distorted view. Acceptable to wear for short periods of time. Very good in cutting glare from road spray and misty precipitation. Not good to wear for extended periods of time."
3,ok sunglasses for price,"good sunglasses, but the polarized lenses don't seem very polarized. i've bought expensive polarized glasses for fishing only to lose them in the water or destroy them at the boat ramp. so i'm strickly buying ""polarized"" sunglasses for under $20. i know nothing will be that great, but in comparison i would recommend going to wal mart and buying the Berkley polarized fishing sunglasses. the lenses are more 'polarized' and a little better quality for the same price. the only problem with that is that you have to go to wal mart. i'm actually going to pick up another pair from berkley this week and put these in my boat for a spare if my friends forget theres.if you can't find the berkley sunglasses these are a good substitue and great price."
3,Not the best of the series...,"Although all of Ms. Hunt's books are well written and researched, this particular book was not as well written as the rest of this series. It didn't capture your attention in the same fashion and seemed a bit wordy. It's worth the read if you have read the others, but doesn't stand on it's own very well."
4,Easy Reading...,I enjoyed the book. Loved the old English vocabulary-of -which I had to check meanings with the use of my Ipad dictionary. I will read more of P.B. Ryan's work.
2,Too much hinting..,...and not enough action. I didn't finish it. I just couldn't get into it; it didn't keep me interested. I read to about 40% and gave it up.
5,Excellent historical mystery,"I've come to accept that most mysteries won't be very well-written, so I was surprised to find such fine writing in this one. The characters are fully fleshed out and believable. The setting is beautifully wrought. I could feel what it was like to be in Boston at the end of the Civil War. I look forward to reading more about Nell."
5,Excellent,This book kept me at the edge of my seat despite being slow in the beginning. Excellent book and I learned some new words. I might even consider law school after reading this book. BRAVO!
2,"If there was a story here, I couldn't get past the boring start to find it","During the Civil War, a young servant who loves babies accepts a position as under-nurserymaid with a rich Boston family.No actual story and nothing about the characters to catch my attention, except that the lady of the house was quite unbelievable democratic. I quit about 10% into the book. The title was marginally relevant to the story. Spelling, grammar, and Kindle formatting were fine."
2,so predictable I delayed reading the whole thing,"I started this book but didn't finish it. This might be ok for someone who is into very light mystery just for something to read; but, for someone who reads lots of good detective fiction, this was a bust for me. I guess I was put off by the lack of a mystery and the stiltedness of the characters; others seem to have found the attention to detail of the era worth the lack of a needed storyline. Not me."
2,Not for Me,"After reading some of the other reviews for this book I wonder if I was reading the same book. Nell, a whore, turned nurse, turned governess investigates a murder involving the son of her mistress, who is not the son of her husband.The basic storyline is unbelievable and the premise that this young woman could insert herself into a murder investigation is highly improbable today much less in the 1860's. Setting aside reality, the slow, overly drawn out and predictable plot line was wasting my time. I found my self skipping over pages at a time trying to fine something interesting. I gave up after about 60% through the book and check the last chapter to see it ended pretty much the way I thought it would."
2,Disappointing,"Straightforward ""He said"", ""She said"" story. I felt as though I'd read this before. The writing lacks depth and definition, details of historical setting are scanty, but some parts are endlessly -and needlessly- detailed. The presence of the child adds nothing to the story. The ""hero""'s parents are unconvincing, as is the outcome. The dialogue is contrived and often contradictory in style. I found it hard to stay with the book until the end."
4,Good Read,I bought this on a whim because it was .99 cents. It is an excellent read and the ending left me searching for the next book. I can not wait to see what happens with Nell. I enjoy a strong female lead in my detective stories and Nell fits the bill.
4,Surprised!,"Some of the free and cheap ebooks I have downloaded have been duds. Happily, this was not. It was a decent mystery with a likeable heroine. Plus, the historical aspect of the book appealed to me. I'm pleased enough with Still Life With Murder to pay for the second novel in the series."
4,gilded bargain,"at 99c,this book is a bargain.i love nell sweeny and i only just met her. she is a sharp cooky.it seems as if this novel is both chick lit and an interesting mystery."
3,Mired Down in filth,"Perhaps the filthiest science fiction I have ever read - mud everywhere! It's really a fairly mediocre little book with am implausible plot, dealing with garbage from the galaxy, but a nice, light reading in a single evening. The author is clearly trying to make the point that we are buried in garbage on earth, and that it will be much the same in outer space. Probably was considered pretty environmentally sensitive for its day."
1,not as expected,"This book gave basic advise about how to fill out applications, dress for interviews, etc. Not very useful with regards to dealing with the stigma of being in prison. Not much about how to convince an interviewer that a prisoner can be a good candidate for a position, etc."
2,Secret of the Old Clock Doesn't Meet up With Standards of Other Nancy Drew Games,This game was way too easy. Not enough tasks and puzzles. I've played all the other Nancy Drew games and this one was very disappointing.
2,Newest game disappointing,"Our family has been playing Nancy Drew games for years. This one is a big disappointment. There was very little humor (especially after the funny LuLu of Blackmoor Manor). The games were too easy, no real good puzzels and the games were very derivative of the other stories. Also, driving the car and playing putt-putt made the game too arcade-like. We hope the next one is better. Play Blackmoor Manor if you haven't already and give this one a pass."
1,Nancy Drew: Secret of the Old Clock,"I was very disappointed with the game. Apparently you have to buy the strategy guide to follow the game intelligently. That should have been indicated upon the purchase. Also when I attempted to save the game, it failed to do so. Everytime you wanted to stop, when you returned to the game you had to start over from the beginning. Very lengthy and boring. It was bought for my 11 year old granddaughter and she was definitely disappointed."
2,strictly for kids only,"i was excited to play this game because i wanted to play a detective-like game. unfortunately, this game is very kid-like. here's an example. the first non auto-generated task is to solve some puzzles for a guy. these are the simple kind of puzzles you could find in a children's word game book. i easily got all of them except 1, meaning i couldn't progress past this point. no problem for me, because by this time i didn't want to! i'm not saying it's a bad game, it's just probably not a good game for grownups."
3,Sadly disappointing,I was so disappointed in the new addition to the Nancy Drew games. I solved the whole case in two evenings and never once had to check with the online community to see if I was doing it right. The puzzles were not near as challenging as the other games and I was disappointed that the body of the games involves having to drive around and deliver telegrams! I have come to love these games because of the challenging aspects and the mind-bending puzzles. This one did NOT make my list of favorites.
4,One of the Easier Nancy Drew Games,"I'm a big fan of Nancy Drew games, and The Secret of the Old Clock is a bit different from some of others. This is the only Nancy Drew game that takes place in the past- in the 1930s. It's also probably the easiest of the Nancy Drew games I've played. Nancy undertakes to help her orphaned friend Emily, who has inherited her mother's inn, and fallen into a deep state of melancholy. The inn has been experiencing strange accidents, and it's up to Nancy to figure them out. The puzzles in this game were a bit easier than the standard Nancy Drew fare. Also, there weren't as many locations to investigate as some other ND games. In particular, there's very little to do in the inn, and one of the things ND games do so well is to set up spooky, old, searchable houses. That said, the game is still fun, and this is a great ND game to start with, if one is new to the genre."
4,Nancy Drew's First Adventure,"Although this doesn't follow the original book, it's a combination of several stories, it holds the 1930's flavor. The design of the scenes are appealing and there are enough puzzles throughout the story. I don't know if this is with all the DVDs, but with this one I had to keep the mouse pointer a half-inch or so in front of the car in order to move it which sometimes proved a bit annoying. In playing it twice, now, I've discovered that you can solve the clues in a different order and still come to the same conclusion. Nice."
4,MAYBE NOT AS BAD AS YOU ALL SAY...,"Perhaps I am coming to this book a little biased, who knows. But seeing as I just read the poorest addition to mystery there is, this book seems like a work of genius. The book I was referring to is Pretend You Don't See Her, by MHC. I think that Christie is just about as fine a mystery writer as you can get, excepting AC Doyle, perhaps. So, in any event, you might ought to try this book. Give Dame Christie a little clout. After all, compare her to the likes of Mary Higgins Clark!! Then you'll think even the worst of Christie is pretty damn good."
5,Evil Under The Sun,Title - Evil Under The SunWell done as are most Agatha Christy stories. Clever plot and good characters. Holds your interest from start to finish!.
3,it's all over,"though it's sad that the betas are breaking up, (and that their final album isn't the greatest), this single is awesome. the b-side, shrek, is better than 80% of the album, and the remix of assesment almost one-ups the original. a little to dance-y for some perhaps, but a lot of fun to listen to."
3,Metal with a Drum Machine,"""Construct Destroy Rebuild"" is a solid release of aggressive Industrial Metal. Driven by heavy guitars and guttural vocals with a drum machine back beat, Crawl seek to punish the machine with human anguish and anger. Recommended for fans of Godflesh, early Pitch Shifter, and Fear Factory."
1,NOT not as described. Not acceptable.,"The grinding of each blade was a mess. The shape of the ""straight"" razor is rounded. The stamps shown on the blades are not on the knife I recieved. The Smith & Wesson emblem is fuzzy - lacking detail and its gold plate is ""wash out"" looking. The emblem is crooked in installation. I am a knife collector. I could not sell this knife at a yard sale for their asking price. I tried - not terribly hard - to contact the seller but found no contact us or e-mail address associatted with this product. Oh well, were I selling knives using this picture, I would not have wasted a stamp on the one they sent me."
2,"Books I-V excellent, then this","While Wingrove has always been kinda mediocre in his writing, his imaginations and characters made the first 6 books good.And I felt he should have STOPPED. There was a fairly satisfying ending at that point. Stop. StopBook VII is so irritating that I've tried to read it 3 times, and failed. Consider that I commonly read 1000s of pages of fantasy/sci-fi a year, and the number of unfinished series [because of apathy] over the last 30 years is countable on one hand.Stop with Boook VI. You do NOT need any thing else"
5,My personal favorite from The Choir,"My personal favorite from The Choir. Know all the songs word-for-word. A little eccentric for Christian Rock, but I guess that's why I like them. And they're not all focused specifically on God - there are a few good ones related to personal/love relationships."
2,Adequate,"Not much to say about the book as with any book of this type, ethical opinions are a matter of reference point, law, societal norms. Just another book on the subject. Not worth more than the paper its written on.Bottom line, ""TRY to do no harm."""
2,What a tragedy!,"Yes, the battle with MOVE itself was a tragedy, but not as much of a tragedy as the publishing of this book! While it is full of good information, just as much information is missing! Pages are out of order, entire chapters are missing, and it is impossible to follow! If you want to know the story of MOVE, this is not the book to use, unfortunately. The author should be sueing the publisher for this mess! And he definitely deserves a free reprint!"
5,A Better Whodunnit,"Let's face it, we live in a YOUTUBE/A-D-D world where attention spans last about as long as...hey, is that a shiny quarter? Where was I? Oh yeah, it's about where we are at but not where we have been or how we got here. Ross Thomas took the talent and time to turn out truly good and entertaining books, this one in particular. Is BRIARPATCH a great book? Well, that's subjective because what's great to some, sucks for others.All I know is that when I get tired of the popular mystery or thriller writers of the day-this day- I go back and find a John D. MacDonald or Ross Thomas to enjoy reading again. A well written book with unique or interesting characters and convincing plot twists, not to mention insight to the ridiculous human experience is usually enough to do it. If you haven't read a Ross Thomas book then find one and see if you don't enjoy it and grin as you do. If you haven't read him in awhile then re-read and discover him all over again."
5,Great storytelling.,"Benjamin Dill of Washington, D.C. makes his living as an investigator for an obscure Senate subcommittee. His investigative powers are put to the test when his own sister, a policewoman, is murdered.Briarpatch is an extremely well written mystery told as a third person narrative. Most of the action unfolds in Dill's hometown, an unnamed city in the southwestern United States.Just as in all Ross Thomas novels, there is plenty of urbane humor. However, unlike most Ross Thomas novels, the story itself is a fairly mainstream, straightforward one. Missing are the way over-the-top characters and situations Thomas fans are used to encountering.Briarpatch is a well crafted mystery novel noteworthy for having a very smooth narrative flow, an appealing cast of characters, clever dialogue and an engaging plot. This is a book all mystery fans will enjoy."
2,"Decent Wireless Adapter, Limited Platform Support","I bought this adapter to use on my laptop, which runs both Windows XP and Fedora Core Linux. I was disappointed to discover that the card is only supported under Windows, requiring special drivers that presumably deliver the SpeedBooster functionality. I was really looking for a 802.11G card and figured ""Hmm...SpeedBooster, why not?"" Now I wish I had gone with Linksys' standard WPC54G card instead."
1,Check the Version No. BEFORE you buy!,"Linksys WPC54GS Wireless-G Notebook Adapter with SpeedBoosterThis is the earliest (oldest) version of the Linksys WPC54GS Wireless-G adapter. Consequently, the Linksys warranty is void and there is no technical support available. The NEW item that purchased was already out of date and useless BEFORE it was even shipped! The item was useless to me because of unresolved installation problems."
1,Garbage,"This card is garbage. I have used Linksys products in the past with good luck. I don't know if this product is too new or what. Would recognize the router but would not connect to the internet. After hours of talking with the totally useless Tech Support people, and several installs and uninstalls with the newest driver, I boxed it up and returned it."
3,"Works, but it takes time to acquire IP address","I purchased this one to use the ""speedbooster"" feature in mhy router... Could not see any performance change. Also the card takes a LOOONG time to acquire IP address... I would stick with the built-in WIFI."
2,Disappointed,"My almost 3-year-old son received this toy for this past Christmas. He loved it outside the tub because he had fun watching it wiggle and dance on the lenolium floor. However, once it got in the tub, the fun went out of it. It would not stay afloat, even after following the directions of squeezing out excess water routinely. Routinely would mean ever 5 seconds. And sadly, he lost his head about 2 weeks ago. My son had not abused it in any way, instead was taking good care of it because he liked it so much. During one bathtime session he was giving the duck a bath and the head came almost completely off, just dangling by a couple of threads. However, there was no fixing it. All in all, my son was able to enjoy this toy for less than 3 weeks. It is a very cute toy so I would suggest that it be used only outside the tub to watch him wiggle and sing."
2,WARNING: ... for Weird Al fans only!,"I am a big fan of Weird Al's music. I have nine of his CDs. But I have to say that UHF is a movie geared more towards children than adults. The only reason I give UHF two stars is because of Weird Al Yankovic and because the movie started out pretty funny but then it got childish. Unless you are a die-hard Weird Al fan who must see UHF, I would suggest listening to the soundtrack opposed to actually watching this film. By the way, I am not saying that Al Yankovic did a bad job acting. I found him quite funny. It was all the other stuff in UHF that made it a not-so-humorous motion picture in my opinion."
5,My favorite movie!,"I saw this movie when I was a little younger and now I've seen it a lot at my cousin's house. It is my favorite movie. I have about every ""Weird Al"" Yankovic album made and now I'm looking for his movie--""UHF."""
5,The best thing since oatmeal wrestling.,"I read Mr. Top 500's review, and I tried, I mean I REALLY REALLY tried to like it, but... come ON! Anyone who thinks ""UHF"" wasn't funny probably laughs when people die. Honestly, who could not like this movie? He probably saw that everyone else liked it and said, ""Ooh, this'll get their attention back on me!""Seriously though, I'm sure he's a nice guy who simply doesn't get why people would laugh at something as funny as ""UHF."" And while I'm on such a roll, I think it is great that UHF has been promoted to the ranks of movies that are so good they can no longer be SOLD IN STORES! It was the same with ""Labyrinth"" until it was demoted to the rank of ""Acquirable."" *sigh*"
4,Beyond a cult classic,"Before we knew Michael Richards as off-the-wall Kramer, he was the off-the-wall Stanley Spadowski in UHF. Before Fran Drescher was the whiny Nanny, she was whiny Pamela Finklestein in UHF.UHF is a zany movie about two friends who can't keep 'normal' jobs, but hit the jackpot when George's (Weird Al) uncle wins a loser UHF station in a poker game. They turn the station around and make it the most popular station in town with the totally wacky shows like 'Strip Solitaire', 'Conan the Librarian' and 'Town Talk'(which was Springer before there was Springer). Their popularity makes the owner of the BIG station in town mad. I hate to reveal the ending, but ""tomorrah is anothah day""!The bonus features are somewhat interesting, although the outtakes grow tiresome. If you like physical comedy or spoofs, you'll like UHF - it was way ahead of its time. Buy it today and laugh"
5,Funny and Well writen!,"I love the series Monk on USA and I was pleasantly surprised when I found out just a few weeks ago that there were books, too.This one was the first I have read of the books so far and it was great!It held true to the character of that nutty but lovable OCD detective.I also enjoyed it being told by Natalie his faithful assistant.I recommend it, a great Funny mystery with a little OCD thrown in.Loved it!"
4,enjoy all,I enjoy all the Monk mysteries & this one is no exception. I will continue to purchase these & haven't quite got them all read yet.
3,Quick but fun,Fun read for Monk fans. His obsessions and inner thoughts are entertaining in print. Easy read to pick up and put down.
3,Loved it till the white dots appeared,"I have had my Tv for a few years now and I had the bulb replaced once so I thought I was safe. then the whire dots apprared and now i am waiting for the repair shop to call me back with my estimate for the repair that SAMSUNG SHOULD BE COVERING!!!!Yes the TV is out of warranty, but they are reparing other models for free yet this model isnt on the list yet??? Come on, bite the bullet and repair them all or Samsung will be losing another customer and dont think that I will ever recommend Samsung to any of my friends...Like I said its a great TV till Samsung screws you on the repair bill."
3,White dot problem on this model too,"I was very satisfied with this tv until this week. The unit is now 2 years old and white dots are appearing on the screen. Samsung has experienced this problem on several models of DLPs. Unfortunately, Samsung has decided to repair several models in a recall/warrenty issue but did not include this model. So if you plan to purchase an older model look for one that Samsung will repair."
1,Dont buy samsung TV,"We purchased the Samsung DLP TV about 9 months back. The TV failed in first week of Feb 2008. Samsung ""certified"" field service technician worked on the TV for 6 weeks, bringing 1 part every week to change & test. He had no idea what was wrong. Then he said the TV had to be replaced since it was under warranty. Then Samsung didn't approve a TV replacement for many days after this. Once they finally approved the replacement, they did not commit to delivering the replacement TV in anytime soon. Many calls to customer service over several weeks got the same response - ""we dont know when we can deliver the TV & we cant do anything about it"". I am still waiting for the replacement TV and it has been nearly 2 months since the DLP TV failed."
1,Beautiful while it worked,"Bought the TV from Amazon. Loved the picture for the first two weeks, but then the TV flat out broke (no picture). The owner's manual indicated that it was a lamp malfunction, so I called Samsung to get the lamp replaced. It took them over a week to get someone out to my place. Replaced the lamp, still no picture. Now I have to wait another week for someone to come out and replace the ballast and color wheel.Overall, it's been a big headache. If I had to do it over again, I'd go with the Sony SXRD. My friend has that set and its picture quality is noticeably better.UPDATE: Repair people came today with a new light engine and board because the ballast and color wheel weren't the problem. Took them about half an hour to install. The TV works fine now. The repair people did say, however, that they always get complaints from Samsung owners. They recommended that I get the extended warranty because, in their words, I'm ""going to need it."""
5,Incredible picture,"Fantastic high def picture. May not have quite the viewing angle as plasma; however, you wouldn't enjoy watching TV at that extreme angle anyway. Plasma and LCD look like great pictures behind a shiny piece of glass. This picture on this set is so life-like it's incredible."
5,My first big screen.,"I just got my new 56 inch Samsung 1080p. Shipping through Eagle was good, it took a week, but they brought it in the house ,set it up and made sure it powered up before they left. Amazon had the best delivered price I had found on the net or in a store. The picture is better than a couple of friends, plasma tvs. The sound is great and picture is sharp. what a great deal for $1699. I would buy another one of these DLPs from Amazon.com if the need ever aroze."
2,Didn't Meet Expectations,"At first the book started off great. Felicity was with Noel in Berlin. I'm a huge Noel & Felicity fan, so I was excited. I thought this book was finally going to be a little piece of fanfic for the Noel fans. I was wrong.The majority of the book is about Felicity thinking about her feelings for both guys. And how did it end? With absolutely no closure."
1,Over Rated Product,"I got really disappointed to see how many good reviews this product had, and how it turned to be a conventional class of the modes.All the material of the curse can be written down in one sheet of paper, as it is the whole manual that it comes with. The rest which is the whole video training, is just a show of how an experimented guitarist cam play the modes, and make phrases out of it with out letting you know a clue of those applications.I Think that if you want to buy a training, you need more than a ""Teacher"" demostrating how much better he can do what you yet can't.Check out other material before you buy."
2,Not that great,"If you went to Berklee or something, this DVD might be for you. For an ordinary Blues, Rock, player like myself, this DVD isn't that terrific. I wonder if Eric Clapton could make any sense if this DVD? I would try Desi Serna, or Will Landrum DVDs instead to learn modes."
2,"Nicely informative, Poorly organized, Recipes aren't great","Preface: I am a novice sauce maker:I read the chapters covering history, stock, and the mother sauces. I enjoyed the history and the basics covered on the mother sauces and stock were covered in a satisfactory manner.My first indication that I didn't like the book was the recipe for veloute. It wasn't until after a few batches of experimenting that i managed to get a reasonable roux going. Also, some things like final liasons and glaces aren't covered too much. In fact a lot of things are mentioned but never discussed in depth.Some of the recipes are great though, and there are a ton of them.Try something else before this book."
2,"I wish I had something more positive to say, but...","Unfortunately I did not enjoy this dvd at all. The instuctor's style was very bland. The instructor does not describe what she is doing very well. It's more like 'now do this, now move your arm up, turn your right toe in...' I could follow the instruction, but wasn't 'learning' anything. I kept thinking 'What am I doing? Is this the same move or a new one?' I couldn't remember anything as the dvd progressed. I was bored and disappointed. Granted, I am a beginner and hadn't seen (or purchased) Volume 1. Maybe that ruined my chances for success, I don't know. I really wish I had something more positive to say, but this dvd is on it's way back to Amazon. :("
2,Disappointing for the money,"I purchased multiple Eddie Bauer Products and this was by far the biggest waste for us. It worked well at first but was quickly not used. It is good for a new baby to nap in or a take along for use at grandma's as it does fold up well but for the older baby it stinks. It does not sit up any higher then maybe 30 degrees, the restraint straps were too small by the time our son was 12 weeks old (he only weighed a little over 12 lbs then and it is rated for 25 lbs ????) and he was cramped in it, no room for his legs. The toys are boring. The zip up netting was a nice feature and he did like the vibrate mode. Overall it got little use, we replaced it with a Baby Bjorn 1-2-3 bouncer and it is 150% better - our son loves this. Don't waste the money, at least I got half back when I resold it on Ebay."
1,Meh,I alwaysed like the mk series but this game got way to demonic for me! The main bosses stage is right on top of a pentagram!
2,Hmmm,"I see a lot of 5 stars here, but I was not impressed at all. I got this becuase I used to love the old mortal kombat, but a lot has changed. Im no video game expert, but the game play sucks, and all the extras suck. My choice was between this and the tekkan, and I would teckan over this game anny day."
3,Too long.,The movie would have been better had they cut out some of the longer action scenes.I like David Morse as an actor and it was worth watching because of him being in it.
2,Once it's up leave it alone.,I have a table that stays outdoors but is folded up and under a tarp when not in use. This net is not made to be put on and taken off. It's difficult to put together in the first place. Worst of all though is that one of plastic hook made for the chain to stretch the top of the net broke on day two. Even though I've found a way to leave it on all of the time this net is still very mediocre.
1,No Instructions on how to assemble!,I would like to use this product. It appears to very sturdy. But there are no directions for how to attach the net to the posts. I give this manufacturer zero stars.
1,just horrible,"awful net hard to set up, and doesn't stand up doesn't come with instructions either.. that's all i have to say"
3,Doesn't fit my small head,"As other reviews have said, the bass sucks, but my biggest issue is that they are not adjustable for size, and they keep slipping off my ears because of the flexible nature of the design; especially when I'm on the treadmill, I can't keep them over my ears.I still own my old pair of Sony over-the-ear headphones, and I thought the Oyoyos would be a good replacement, but now I have to use the Sonys at the gym and the Oyoyos on the train."
3,Not bad,"Good sound, pretty comfortable. My biggest complaint would be the lack of privacy, people around you can hear what you are listening to."
4,heart monitor,"I like it. I haven't had a chance to figure out all the features yet, but I'm not sure if I'll need to use all of them anyway. It's been pretty easy to use so far. The only compaint is that the band that goes around the chest rubs on my skin and I've gotten a little chaffing. But I have pretty sensitive skin, so it's probably more to do with me than the actual product."
5,great heart rate monitor!!,"This item really does all it says. It keeps an accurate account of your exercise time, calories burned, min and max hr. It also keeps a weekly log that you can upload into free software that is located on Polar website. You can also set it for 3 different degrees of workout based on HR(easy med and hard). I really like it and it has an alarm. Otherwise very satisfied with watch and it motivates me to workout at my target HR."
3,Ok Product,"I really liked this Heart Monitor but had major problems with the chest strap. I had to tuck it under my sports bra for it to stay in place and not end up around my waist. I had it the tightest it could go, if it could have been a little tighter maybe I would have kept it. However, after reading into the Motiva Mio heart monitor I realized that to get an accurate reading you need the chest strap. So I might purchase this one again...."
4,Love it,"Really happy with this product so far. Works well in hot and cold weather, is accurate, and easy to use."
1,How do you size these,The description says 1/2 barb by 1/2 barb. I thought this had something to do with the diameter of the item in relationship as to what size hose it would fit. My mistake as what I receive is a tiny black plastic item for maybe 1/4 inch hose?So if the 1/2 has nothing to do with what the diameter is just how do you know what hose size it will fit.They appear to be of good quality but no where near 1/2 unless they are talking about the length of the connector?
4,"a good mystery but somewhat ""dated.""","I ordered this book because years ago I read some of her myst eries and enjoyed them. That was at least thirty years ago, so I do find this one somewhat ""dated"", but I still enjoyed it."
2,BUZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ,"I bought the Costco version and didn't need the speakers but the unit buzzes!So I returned it and picked up another one. And it buzzes!I called Princeton and they told me ""it's a problem"" and they are working on it. Guess I'll be returning this one too."
1,Bags Are Almost Impossible To Find,"The vacuum works great, however...WARNING: Bags are almost impossible to find. You will NOT find them in stores. When searching online, Dirt Devil has a ""Royal"" line, so countless Dirt Devil bags will pop up. I don't know if they've stopped making this machine or not, but if you get one and can find bags, stock up for life, literally. Two years ago, I could find bags online. Now, I think I found them on Amazon, but they're imitations, not even made by the Royal company, itself.You cannot use a terrific vacuum if you don't have bags for it!!!!"
5,Easy to use and does a great job,It's been easy to use and the built-in 2 minute run time has proven invaluable in helping me make my dentist happy. While I won't see my dentist until October 2011 (bought in July 2011 on his recommendation).It is also waterproof so I can use it in the shower.
1,It is like the jack hammer of toothbrushs,It tickels and is too intense. I called the company and they said it takes some time to get use too. It has been a month and I still hate this tooth brush. I feel like I am using a jack hammer every time I brush.
1,WASTE OF MONEY,"The original 4300 series was wonderful. Very difficult to locate. Anyway, this model is horrible. There is no power to the brush. I could buy a battery operated one for the features of this model. The brush is soft and small. It does not clean well. The only good feature is the 60 second timer which in order to clean your teeth properly you must go way beyond that time. I bought it on sale hoping it would be comparable to original version but it's not. It's a waste of money."
4,replacement,Philips Sonicare Essence 5300 Power Toothbrush. I have been a fan of sonicare for several years ever since my dental hygeanist recommended it. This one replaces an older model which didn't hold a charge after 15 years of service. The new one works fine but doesn't give 30 second signals like the old one did to help you pace the 2 minute brushing.
1,Philips ruined a great product,"Ever since philips bought out sonicare it's obvious that their manufacturing has gone to the lowest bidder (in china). They are nothing but high priced disposable junk now - (189.00 flexcare+ on my third replacement in less than 8 months). My last sonicare, prior to the flexcare+ died right after the warranty expired. I have to say, I'm finally done with them.... I'm going back to oralB. What a shame, use to be a great product till philips got involved."
3,Not as good as the Elite Model,"This is my second Sonicare tooth brush (the first brush was an elite). This Essence 5300 brush functions very similar, but does not have as nice as features. The handle is not quite as nice, a bit more slippery and awkward to hold (the elite's handle is round with rubber grip). The 5300 only has a 2 minute timer and does not have the 30 second quadrant timing marks. The 5300 also does not have a battery life indicator (like the Elite).While the 5300 brush does the same job of brushing, I would probably spend the extra money next time and get the enhanced features of the Elite."
4,Helps me brush my teeth.,"Cool toothbrush. I feel like I'm brushing my teeth with a paint mixer. Works well, makes cool sound, and I can easily cover my entire bathroom and body with toothpaste foam if I forget to turn the thing off when I take it out of my mouth."
4,very good,i have been using this for over 6 months now and i am very satisfied with the quality and performance. the only negative point is the toothbrush cap.
3,Sonic toothbrush,The brush is excellent. I have been using sonicare toothbrushes for years. The reason that I gave it 3stars is because it no longer has tone that tells you how much time you have left.
2,not easy,We had a previous Sonicare and liked it till it died. This model however is not easy to use. The screw on top is difficult to attach--something seems misaligned. I suspect that Sonicare has cheapened it down and will not buy another.
3,Batteries not accepted,"My other battery operated toothbrushes, around five total, were simply not in the same league as this Sonicare. My teeth actually feel smooth and I was told by my dental hygienist that this was the one to get to help my gums. Boy, does it ever! The only ""squawk"" I have with it is changing the battery. I doubt if I can do what the booklet says and that is a shame. Other than the battery, I love my Sonicare!"
5,best toothbrush I have ever used,"I don't think I could say enough good things about my new toothbrush! It works great, my mouth feels super clean!"
2,big disappointment,"brush heads WAY too expensive and are worn out in a month, not three, as they claim. Also handle cavity gets red mildew down in it, is hard to clean. I intend to get another Cybersonic. my first lasted many years and brush heads cost much less."
1,Poor battery,I have been disppointed with its battery life. Have to be constantly on charger and still shuts off sometimes within seconds.
3,battery issues,"I love sonicare but unhappily am going to buy another one bc the battery lost ability to hold a charge. DO NOT TAKE it to EU even if you charge it on a converter. The battery won't hold a charge anymore. I was rather shocked as it is a fairly new unit but something funky happens when you use a converter to charge it, so its great in the US and SA only..... sigh"
2,Gross Film inside brush head,"I'm pleased with the actual ability of the brush, but I've been using the product since December after using an Oral B that ended up braking after several years and I am displeased with the cleanliness of the brush head. After using the brush head for a few weeks, it gets this really gross pinkish film inside the plastic cover of the brush head that ends up leaking onto the brush head holder and it also starts to smell. Now, I'm rinsing the brush head after each use and simply placing it on its stand. What happens after that, I'm unsure of. It's actually really disgusting that I'm brushing my teeth with a smelly tootbrush head. I'm wondering if others have this same issue."
5,Philips Sonicare,"I've aways liked a rechargeable toothbrush. I especially like this one because the head of the brush is small, the unit itself is compact and has a case for traveling. Also, the price is right!"
3,Philips Sonicare,I find it runs out of charge quite quickly. It is suppose to last much longer. My initial purchase lasted at least two weeks.
5,I would buy again,The sonicare does a great job. I feel like my teeth are really clean after use. I have had this for a little over a month. I am waiting to hear what the dentist says since I have a plaque problem.It doesn't make the mess my old Oral B did. Hope it lasts longer.I would like to review this product again in 6 months.
3,Good for teeth and gums,"but am looking for another type of toothbrush. This was to replace a ""quad pacer"" which had a 30 second timer. This one doesn't have the timer and I miss it. Otherwise it does the job."
4,Very pleased,"I purchased this product for my wife, so I can only base my opinion on her comments. She takes very good care of her teeth, and has purchased several power toothbrushes over the years. She is constantly looking for high quality products. She says the Sonicare toothbrush is clearly the best she has ever used. She recommends it highly."
5,Amazing Toothbrush,Sonicare definitely knows the right product to ensure you get the best results. Would recommend this item to anyone. I will never to go back to a regular tooth brush in my life.
2,toothbrush,Part of the reason that I bought another sonicare toothbrush was because it had the timing feature that beeps to let you know it's time to move to another quadrant. This feature only worked the very first time and has not worked since. Very disappointing.
5,Great Feeling,I have had a Sonicare before a few years ago. I had forgotten how fresh your mouth feels when you use it. I won't be without one again....ever.
3,It works but ....,"We find the Sonicare to be the best toothbrush, but when I ordered replacements for our daughter's and our own 9 year-old defunct brushes, we were disappointed on two counts:a) the unit comes with a single brush head. The original came with two brush heads. This was not a case of misleading advertising, though; I had not read the description carefully enough.b) the new unit does not pause after 30 seconds, like the original did, to notify the user to move to a different quarter in the mouth. Both my husband and my daughter complained that this feature was missing."
5,Makes my mouth Tingle!,"This is a great electric toothbrush. The Bristles are nice and soft on my teeth. I was a little vary about ordering a electric toothbrush at first, but this one was a hit. It left my mouth feeling nice and clean. The best thing about this brush is that it comes with a travel case, makes it very easy to travel with. Plus, when charged, this lasts for 2 weeks with out recharging, no need to worry about carrying the charger around!I would definitely recommend to everyone.SONICARE ESSENCE 5300 1 BRUSH W/TRAVEL CASE"
5,The Gold Standard,"This is quite simply the best toothbrush I have ever owned. At first I was skeptical about buying an electric toothbrush, but after using this my mouth feels so clean, I never will go back to using regular toothbrushes. This also was highly recommended by my dentist, who tells me it is much more effective at removing plaque than traditional toothbrushes. Highly Recommended."
1,Inquisition...,"If batteries had been around during the inquisition, the Sonicare Essence would have been a prime instrument of torture! The nerve sensation in my gums, plus the high pitch noise, combined to make me feel like my brains were being fried."
2,Beware buying electrical items with delivery outside of USA,"Returned - unsuitable for Australian electrical specification (240volts). To purchase power convertor was more than the value of the items. We were purchasing from an Australian Address so assumed that the goods would be suitable for use in Australia - more warning regarding purchasing electrical goods from another country.Philips Sonicare Hx5351/30 Essence, Rechargeable, Power Toothbrush, White"
4,Bought as a birthday gift,Purchased this for my husband for his birthday. He likes it and uses it every day. Happy with this purchase.
5,Replacement Unit,"This is actually my second Sonicare toothbrush. My first brush was recommended by my dentist and I used it for years before the recharger ceased to work. The new unit is primarily the same as the original which tells me there was little room for improvement or revision. Backed with a two year warranty, I can endorse this product above other electric toothbrushes which were not even considered when my first unit needed replacement.Philips Sonicare Essence Power Toothbrush"
4,Nice electric toothbrush for the money,"For the money you spend on this electric toothbrush, you will feel a cleaner mouth. Worth the money compared to other electric brushes. Also a plus because it has a small brush head. Some of the other brushes have brush heads that are too big."
5,Great product and Great Value,"I was not sure when I bought this, but my dentist had recommended the brand as the best one to purchase. I chose this model because of the price, and because I only needed one power toothbrush (some come with two). Be sure and buy an additional package of two brush heads, because the brush needs to be changed at least every 3 months. I like this product because the charger is compact, and does not take up much space in my bathroom. You will be amazed how much cleaner your teeth feel after using this toothbrush. There is a 2 minute timer, and I realized that I was not previously brushing my teeth for enough time. The power toothbrush starts out slower for the first several times you use the brush before going up to full speed. Buying this brush will save you $$$ because you will avoid future dental work."
2,Just OK,I have used the Sonicare for years. I was confused about the features and miss the timer which lets you know when to move the brush to a different part. This is the no-frills version.
5,Sonicare electric toothbrush,"Got this to replace my aging Sonicare.Works better than my first, and holds charge well.The first resulted in GREAT dental improvement, per my hygienist."
4,Philips Sonicare Hx53551/30,Excellent product. Really does the job. Need to clean and dry properly after each use. This should be emphasized more in productinstructions. Also should get two heads with initial purchase.
4,"Good value, good results","I previously had two low-end Oral-B electric toothbrushes and this time decided to try the low-end Sonicare. I've been using it for 5 months now and I prefer the Sonicare because it leaves my teeth feeling cleaner. The battery also lasts a lot longer (about 2 weeks on a charge). After a couple of years the Oral-B needed to be charged each use. I keep the Sonicare off of the charger until it needs recharging, so we'll see how the battery holds up over time. I did like the round brush head of the Oral-B better for reaching the back of my front teeth. It's a bit harder to angle the Sonicare just right to reach those teeth. I also miss the alert the Oral-B brush provides after two minutes of brushing. The Sonicare has a timer, but just shuts down after two minutes with no advance alert. Overall the Sonicare was a good value and I'm satisfied with the results."
4,Philips Sonicare Power Brush,This is a good product and I am pleased with its performance. Being a previous owner of Sonicare I was a little disappointed that it did not have the timer capabilities. The basic performance of cleaning your teeth is very good.Clarke
2,Annoying sound,"Although this product was rated highly by Consumer Reports, I found the sound of the vibrating brush shaft against my teeth very annoying. It is difficult to avoid the touching of the shaft against the teeth while brushing for 2 minutes. I returned the product!"
3,Lacks 30sec timer,"I had no problems with the vendor or the item as such. The only downside is that it lacks the 30 second prompts that I got from my previous Sonicare. Disappointing, but overall a good value for the price."
3,sonicare,Am not really pleased as I did not notice that there was no thirty second alarm to let you nknow to change quadrants in brushing. Will have to pruchase another sonicare system.
2,"Without Quadpacer, I have no love...","I had a Sonicare that died when it was 10. I loved that toothbrush, so I didn't even think twice about buying another one. Unfortunately, I bought this product, based purely on price. I didn't even think to look if it had the 30 second-interval-beep feature because I assumed it did. It doesn't and I hate it just because of that. Idiotic reasoning perhaps, but I know I'm stuck with it for a few years now."
4,"As Good As It Gets, I Guess.","I've never had much experience with electric toothbrushes, but my two years with this model has been trouble-free so far. It charges easily and quickly and takes over a week to lose its power. That's with me AND my girlfriend brushing morning and night for two minutes at a time. Not bad, not bad at all. When we go on vacation, we don't even take the charger.It's also handy that the attachments come color-coded. That way we don't use each other's brush. An easy to overlook bit of convenience, I must say. Thanks for that, Sonicare.As long as you keep the bases nice and clean instead of cruddy, you probably won't have much to complain about with this item. I just can't see myself giving it 5 stars without ever having any other electric brush to compare it to."
3,Good but get the next model,"This tooth brush performs just like any of the other model Sonicares two issues though:1. The way the heads go on is very poorly designed, water gets inside of the toothbrush and begins to rot/mold/stink. This requires a lot of toothbrush maintenance.2. These tooth brush heads have no generic option and cost $8-$12 a pop. They have to be replaced about every 3 months too!. Adds up fast.I would recommend one the the higher end models or the oral B sonic. For a slight higher upfront cost, you get a much easier brush to maintain and the generic heads are like $2-$3."
3,"DOA, but had good intentions","I think my product was dead on arrival, the 30 second pulse feature and the ""ease into it"" feature that were big selling points of this product did not work. It also shut off on me intermittently during use. I have a pretty sensitive roof of my mouth, and this was just shy of torture to brush with- although I hear you can get used to that. One reason I was really disappointed when the ""ease into it"" feature was not working. Also, after talking to my dentist, he recommended one that had the spinning circular brush on it. I have returned it (still waiting for refund... but Amazon is normally pretty good about that stuff), and plan to buy a different model."
2,Could be better,"I have used Sonicare before and liked it, but not so keen on this one. It drips a lot and leaves a brown residue in the holder even though I clean it very regularly. Also disappointed that it doesn't have the 30 second intervals like my old one. It works OK otherwise."
2,Wished I had bought the QUAD PACER,"I have owned four Sonic Care toothbrushes to date. I thought this one was the same but it doesn't have the Quad timer, my mistake! I will read the ads more carefully in the future."
2,Review!,I'm not really a fan of electric toothbrushes it seems. I tried this one as my first one ever and much prefer the old classic I get from my dentist.
4,4th Sonicare,This is the 4th Sonicare we've owned in the past 15+ years and have not been dissatisfied in any way whatsoever. That is what prompted me to stick with a product of known quality and performance.The 4-star instead of a 5-star is that this model no longer has the 30-second indicator beep. It is not a problem since I'm going to brush until I'm done anyway but the reminder to go to another quadrant was nice.
3,Disappointed,"My old Sonicare recently gave out, but considering it lasted nearly a decade, I was happy to purchase another. Philips no longer makes my old model, so I opted for the 5300. It works fine and I'm sure will offer many years of dependable use, however I feel duped and am considering returning it. My old brush had a two-minute timer that pulsed every 30 seconds, alerting you to switch to another section of your mouth. The product detail for the 5300 mentions the ""2 minute Smart Timer,"" which I thought was the same thing. Not so much. Basically, this one just quits after two minutes. If you want the real ""smart"" timer, I guess you have to upgrade to one of the really expensive models. I can understand adding new bells and whistles (e.g., UV cleaning) to justify the pricier brushes, but don't take features away from the others! Lame."
4,Great place to start stretching,"A good place to start learning to stretch. Bob does know his stuff! Plus his models are my age! But, Bob: please look directly at the camera. He appears very nervous at the beginning, but eventually warms up. He goes thru many stretches to show the correct technique. He then has a 16 minute section for every day stretches. I have this DVD in my player at all times and key it up when I get back from my walks. Order his book (spiral bound version) as well. [...].Again, this is a great place to start getting limber."
3,nice try,"The watch is not as finely made as I would have hoped, based on the elegance of the design. You can see the design very well here on Amazon. The case material, though it is apparently metal, has a dull, plastic-looking finish to it. The leather band is a composite of padded leather with a thin covering of dyed leather. The buckle is of a thinner gauge of metal than seems appropriate.On the other hand, the packaging was of finer material than necessary: the watch arrived clasped around a white leather-covered cushion in a hard-sided hinged box.Go figure."
3,How to construct a 19th C coal-gas plant,"This book is a reprint of a treatise on the construction of coal-gas plants first published in England in 1883. The author attempts to cover all aspects of construction and design; the book incorporates a number of tables and specifications which a prospective builder would need to consider.By the 1880's the major features of efficient coal-gas production had been established and for this reason this book is of real interest. This title would, however, have gained more 'stars' if the reprint had contained the drawings and diagrams which it had listed in the table of contents. I can only assume that this feature wasn't included because it didn't reproduce satisfactorily.The publishers are to be commended for the re-issue of this title. Coal-gas plants were once a common feature throughout the British Commonwealth and now there are none. For the researcher who wishes to learn about their construction this book is recommended."
5,My third Sonicare...can't imagine brushing with anything else.,"My third Sonicare and my favorite. My second one still works but thought I would invest in a new model instead of buying more brush heads for the older one. Excellent brushing action and very reliable product. I like the quad timer feature. Helps you manage your brushing time more efficiently. Have read some reviewers complaining of the ""slime"" factor with the brush head design. I simply remove the brush head after each brushing and there's never a problem. Highly recommend this toothbrush."
2,Works great when it holds a charge,This toothbrush works great when it holds a charge. The problem is that it doesn't hold a charge for very long anymore. I've owned this brush for 18 months and the battery life has slowly gotten worse over the past 6 months. Originally I would be able to brush without charging the battery for over one week. Now the brush won't hold a charge for two brushes (so it won't even last one day).I'm returning the brush to Phillips for a replacement since they will replace the brush inside two years.
1,dull boring dull,"I don't know what Helmet was like back in the day but this music says nothing really, is not very catchy or compelling in any way.....try their early stuff maybe or Faith No More.........."
3,Mad,"In the most friendly way possible I want to say the review below me said ""I downloaded it a couple months ago and it didnt do anything for me"" etc...You didnt even BUY it! Your rights are null and void pal. Maybe thats why--you got the wrong version of the album! Forget cho a**.To the point:People age and Page Hamilton and his (amended) crew do too. I was quite shocked & disappointed by the vocals--expecting the terse cut down low of long ago--but then I thought ""that was a long time ago!"" for what its worth it was still worth it --I did not hear any stupid ass turntable crap and a bunch of melody--yeah-beneath the ugly its there. Its not the best thing I have heard but give them some credit--Helmet is still sticking it to us. It takes guts for them to come out of hiding after so long...I think it takes guts. When I picked this up, I wasent the only one at the checkout with this album in my hand. I have only heard it once....It can only get better."
4,It just grows on you...,"First of all, I only know ""Breathing"", so I can't say anything about the other songs on this single. Anyway, what i CAN say is that this song DOES grow on you. Didn't think it was anything special, but after listening to it a couple of times, when you start to pay more attention to the lyrics, to Jason's voice, to the music or the song itself, you can't help loving it. If you're ever feeling kinda low, just play this. It'll help. I know. :)"
2,"Not well refurbished, need better QC.","Bought this as a spare/backup for my vehicles. So hooked up antenna/swr, power. Turned on power, LED came on at channel 9, heard thump on speaker but no signal/noise (also nothing on signal meter) just a slight buzzing sound. Double checked switches (cb/pa to cb and nor/ch9 to normal) and knobs (squelch down, rf gain up, volume midway) and went through all the channels but still no signal. Tapped on knobs and case and finally got some rf noise. Rotating through channels and got several clear signals. Tested fine with my base station, transmit and receive. Tapped the unit again and no signal. Powering on and off, unit is inconsistent and needs tapping to be functional. Appears to be internal bad/intermittent connection. Not exactly good for mobile use. Time to return unit to Amazon."
2,Ugh,Its exactly what it seems to be for idiots..way too simple and obvious..not what I was looking for.
5,Great Historical Reference of Personal Computers,"This book shows the history of personal computers, from the early build-it-yourself Altair kits, through 8-bit systems like the Commodore VIC-20 and 64 and even later systems. It displays some computer systems most of us have never heard of, along with great pictures of attachments, device ports and the systems themselves.If you have any interest in the history of personal computing, this is a great reference."
4,Nostaglic look back at early days of PC industry,"Take a visual stroll through the early days of personal computing, from 1975's seminal MITS Altair to 1988's failed NeXT cube, before the market bifurcated between Mac and Windows users. This 192-page paperback examines 40 classic computers of yesteryear, each depicted from all sides with full-color photography and annotated with original specifications and pricing. Laing's text also reveals many juicy tidbits about the companies and personalities that dominated the industry in its infancy. Given the author's British background, the coverage of many obscure models from the UK is to be expected, though they may not be appreciated by American audiences. I found the inclusion of video game systems a curious choice, too. My only major criticism is that the text accompanying the spendid photos is unnecessarily small and difficult to read."
4,do you remember these?,"Let us go back a few years. Thumbing through these pages will give some of you a surge of nostalgia for your mislaid youth. Laing documents in word and images a vanished world of mostly dead architectures and companies, that flourished before the rise of Wintel.He has gone to some lengths to show us the most popular machines of their times. Like the MITS Altair 8800, widely considered the first personal computer. Of course, the Apple II is included in the book. And who can forget the Trash 80? Or the luggable Osborne? The latter was called portable. But luggable was thought to be the better term.Game machines like the Ataris and Nintendo are also in the book. Here, undoubtedly, many of you did indeed squander days and weeks (months?), when you should have been swotting.The photos are very cleanly done. Each looks like a shot taken when the machines were new."
2,"lame, very","If literary tedium is just cause for the deathpenalty Marjorie would be executed many, many times in all 50 States.The unending references to Stephen King's books,the recital of fast food meals spilled, eaten, andprepared and the drug/car obsesssions willleave the readers dead in their seats as sure asa lethal injection.Check out Snow Angels or The Names of the Deadfor thoughtful, emotion-packed writing."
2,I thought this book was boring.,"I didn't like The Root Cellar all that much. I thought it was very boring and for the subject, it could have been better. It is about a girl named Rose, who is sent to live with her aunt after her grandma dies. Her aunt has this cellar that Rose goes into and comes out in another century. It could have been better"
4,Book about the Civil War in part,"This ia a story of a little girl who moves in with her aunt. She is used to living in Paris, with every luxory. She doesn't like her aunt much, or her cousins. she finds a root cellar which takes her to another time. Just when this book begins to get a little monotonous, something exciting or intersesting happens. This book leaves you with a feeling of wonder."
2,Poor refund policy,I received 50% refund on returning the product in original condition since I did not like what I received. Why such a high deduction? You should require merchant to post the refund amount when ordering. I also paid for shipping the product back thus resulting in only 25% refund of what I paid originally.
5,Poetic Bliss,"I am thankful that my sister-in-law gave me this book otherwise I may have never found it. There is an uplififting poem, or sometimes a quote, usually from famous literary figures, for each day of the year. The selections often remind me of the poems I'd have to decipher on my exams at my college prep. school for girls. I didn't appreciate them at the time but now I enjoy the challenge.Each month features a beautiful timely painting. These are worth the price of the book! There also cute little drawings throughout.I recommend this to anyone who enjoys reading and deciphering poetry; meditating upon uplifting quotations; and viewing bucolic oilpaintings."
1,Yuck!,"I decided to try amaranth flour because it sounded like it had so much good nutritive value to it but yuck, it tasted like wet cornsilk...ick, ick, ick!! I love Barry Farms selection but they are slow in getting their products to you, and although their quality is good they tack on quite a bit of shipping, but if you can't find what you want anywhere else with less shipping, Barry Farms has a good selection and like I said their quality is good. I will pass on amaranth flour next time though as I could even taste the amaranth flour in my flour mixes. It had a strong flavor and smell, one that I couldn't get past, so I threw it out. I'll stick to all my other gluten free flours that I really like and there are others that have good nutritive value as well like quinoa flour."
3,Pretty good album,"I heard ""Unbelievable"" on a local radio station, and fell in love with the song. I looked and looked, and finally found it on the internet. I listened to that song for hours after i received the disc in the mail. My favorite tracks are: Supafly, Unbelievable, When in Doubt, and Lift it. I rated this only three stars because I guess the songs have too much-how should put it?- plain hard rapping. Don't get me wrong, I love Hard rock and rap! But when it's done bluntly, it kinda takes the UMMPH out of it. Oh, and one more thing I don't like... In the song, ""Rhyme Animal"", Trevor McNevan states: ""That's the funk""... With trevor's voice, and pitch, it sounds a lot like ""That's the f..."" Other than those flaws, it's a pretty good CD!"
3,Positively Scary,"This movie gave me nightmares many nights after seeing it as a teenager. Yikes! I've never quite figured out why some people like to get scared out of their wits! Some things are so frightening, there is no pleasure to be found in the experience."
4,Murders in thE Rue Morgue,It followed the written story quite well. The students enjoyed it but they wanted to see the ape more and what happened to it.
2,A Powerful Performance,If you have not seen this movie I want to warn you that C. Dupin is portrayed as an old man who is retired from the police force and has no interest at all in solving mysteries. He doesn't care about anything except playing chess and he is so feeble that he can barely do that. After 40 minutes there is an actual murder and after that you get to watch twenty minutes of his daughter begging him to solve the case. Of course he finally decides to give the case a go and I would like to tell you what happened after that but unfortunately I fell asleep.
2,History or HIS-Story?,It seems to be that the White man has left out the contributions of the Black man in this story of baseballs oppression of the Negro athelete.
4,Scary how this can happen,This was disturbing to read how accepted Jim Jones was as he descended into madness and how he took so many with him. Makes you wonder how it could happen.
2,Not so hot.,"Brust is a master fantasist. In that realm, he is without compare. His work often evokes the sense of awe and whimsy that the best of Zelazny's work does without any overlap in style. Brust is truly a great author.But it doesn't seem that his talents extend to science fiction. I'm really not sure why, but it's true. Every SF short story of his that I've read has fallen on its face and this novel... oh my, this novel... is simply not very good. I wanted to like it, and I tried to like it, but to no avail. Whatever it is within Brust's talents that allow him to give so much life to his fantasies seems to be completely lacking from this work.The only reason I can think of for wanting this book would be if you simply *had* to have a complete collection of Brust's works. Otherwise, I'd recommend passing on it. It's Brust, but it ain't that great."
3,"Pacific War, 1931-1945","This is a reasonably fair analysis of the Pacific war itself, particularly when compared with the mine run of Japanese histories. Unfortunately, Ienaga's basic anti-Americanism is such that he regards the supposed abuse of the Japanese population by American occupation forces as comparable to acts of occupying Japanese forces elsewhere in Asia during the war."
3,other reviews right,"The historical curiousity review is quite sound and interesting. However, this little book does have some redeeming qualities, especially when it limits itself to the militarization of Japanese society. The sections on the education system are good. The communists bunk is there. Reading Chang's biography of MAO gives a more realistic historical assessment of the shared interests and, at times, complicity between Chinese communists and the Japanese invaders - a legacy left out of China's government mandated ""protests"" against Japan's atrocious war record (one the communists in China shared and continued for decades after Japan's defeat)"
5,"delightful, helpful and lovely!","A friend lent me this book and I found it so delightful, so helpful, that I now am purchasing my own copy. Very well done - particularly helpful layout and variety of categories for developing your garden."
2,Not that much in there.,"If you are considering buying the product because of the product image above, don't. They'll only send you one small bottle that might look like a special paintball lens cleaner but is probably no more than a bottle of cleaner for glasses."
4,Delightful Reading!,"This was a well-writtren and enjoyable novel in which several children have intriguing adventures. While reading my fingers were always poised, ready to turn the pages and read on. Murder for her Majesty takes your mind on a journey to England. As you read this book, you will delight in a mystery that casts suspicions on the queen herself and a race against time to try to prevent yet another murder."
2,"Come on now, Koontz","I didn't know that Dean Koontz was into writing supernatural romance novels for Harlequin readers - until I read this book.The main character is a psychotic and emotionally cold character who runs around saving people like some knight in shining armor, while shunning the spotlight.And of course the female character, Holly, is obsessed by this mysterious stranger with a dark past, determined to psychoanalyze him, save him from himself, and fall madly in love with him.The book starts out with typical Koontz humor and fast-paced action, but then turns into the type of smut you always see middle-aged women buying at Kmart. The characters and the plot are awful, with a totally predictable ending. I had to force myself to finish it because I could tell exactly what was going to happen, and I complained to my fiance about how bad it was while reading the last 100 pages.But then I decided the book was almost so bad that it was good - to laugh at!"
2,It was okay,"This one didn't do as much for me as his other books. I am a pretty big fan of his, but I didn't think this book compared to his others. It wasn't a terrible book, and I don't regret reading it. I just wouldn't recommend it, when Dean Koontz has written so many books that are a lot better."
2,Sadly Disappointed,"In parts excellent and in most other parts overly descriptive and over explained. I've read loads of Mr. Koontz'z books in the past and most of them have been excellent. This one I think often talks down to the reader and explains things over and over which have already been hinted at and should be left for the reader to work out.The book could have been written in half the pages and would have been the better for it.It's not all bad and I loved some of the writing as always but put together as a whole this one didn't really do it for me. It's a real shame because I have always been a big fan and I had looked forward to it.I would still recommend that people try his other books. I can't remember them all but I know that I enjoyed ""Whispers"" and a few others were also riveting."
3,Lacking.,"Well developed characters, a good story line, and some exciting sequences, however, it loses steam about half way, and although Mr. Koontz tries to recover going into the ending it just doesn't happen. A dissappointment, and not really worthy of three stars."
2,"Cold, no fire.","The writing is Dean Koontz. The classic 'protagonist with troubled past' is Koontz too. But the rest of it is blah.First of all, the characters' names. Only Dickens has been able to successfully give characters names that described their personalities. Thorne & Ironheart sound like a Harlequin fantasy. Second, the lack of a good antagonist. Koontz may have been trying to get away from Phantoms, Watchers, Midnight, etc. but this is a sad attempt to make us scared. The big secret of the book is a letdown worse than a bungee cord breaking. Ultimately, there's the happy ending where the bad part of the hero is exorcised and there's only good ol' Jim riding off into the sunset with his adoring sidekick (who's as interesting as Saran Wrap). As far as I'm concerned, Cold Fire lacks Intensity, and is a Bad Place."
2,Not at all good.,"This is, in my mind, one of the worst/boring books that Koontz has written. There is a build-up (albeit a bad one), and there is absolutely no climax!!! The story goes, and goes - and comes to a gentle halt. No brakes, no ""Wow!"" - just...... Get my point? Michael Perera, DXB, U.A."
4,book,I enjoy reading books on my kindle have not read this book yet but am looking forward to it. thanks
2,Genius or Gibberish?,"Is this a brilliant work of fiction or 150 pages of gibberish? This little book can be a tough read. Is it because of its French origin and something is lost in the translation (the French are so different from us), or is it because as a man reading it I missed the point of the female writers nuances? I have not decided yet. From the description on the cover I was expecting the story of a desparate search for a missing person. But the action (if you could call it action) takes place in the narrators fractured mind, and half way through the book you begin to question if there ever was a husband. Maybe a second reading would bring more insight into the character. If you are looking for a book with a good plot, action, dialogue and character development, look elsewhere."
5,BRAVA ITALIA by Paul Sorvino DVD,"The best Presentation DVD you'll ever see. It is an exellent DVD the PHOTOGRAPHY & Filming ( Astonishing ) I've no words to describe it you must see it it is a long DVD & the qualyty of the recording it looks allmoust like HD.I have an upconversion or ( UPSCALING ) DVD Player up to 1080P on a LCD or plasma screen, it looks like you are flying over ITALY one of my best collection DVD that I own. Congratulation Paul Sorvino."
1,Waste of money,This guide is twenty pages of fluff. You can get more in-depth information off the Internet for free. Put your money into a real guide.
3,"good taste, no preserves, too expensive, low carbonation","pretty much summed it up in the title.Really just bought to round out my free shipping requirementI love san pellegrino sodas, but this particular flavor very hard to find.Wont pay 13 bucks for a six-pack again though.All natural, but suger is added which I hate.Some reason tasted less carbonated, less ""fizzy"" than usual."
5,Great backpack,Got this for my daughter so she would have a unique backpack. It held up through the entire year and she still uses it when she goes to spend the night away from home.
3,Scary stuff indeed!,"This is definetely one of the most fascinating books i have read in a long time. All the stuff about embalming, necrophelia and what happens to a corpse after death is fascinating in a bizarre way.Unfortunately certain parts of the books drag things down a bit. Like the parts where the author goes ghosthunting with a taperecorder and in her first try record some voices from the dead. This seems highly unlikely to happen, especially for a total newcomer to such things, but hey, maybe she was lucky. Theres also a couple of other situations like these that irretated me. The best parts of the book are the ones based on reality, like what it is like living in a funeralhome, and so on. But despise its flaws i defenitely recommend this one!"
2,Superfical and Lacking Information,"If you want a book which just skims the surface of many death-related topics and gives you a survey of the subject, this is not a bad choice. The coverage is purely anecdotal and offers less understanding of mortuary proceedures than a good episode of ""Six Feet Under,"" ""Autopsy"" or the old ""Quincy"" series.I found it to be disappointing in content and writing style. Ramsland is no Thomas Lynch. If you know anything at all about mortuary science, this book will be a disappointment. If you have no knowledge beyond flushing goldfish and burying birds, it could be a decent introduction to the subject."
2,Scatological,"This is a rambling collection of anecdotes. It really doesn't cover anything very well, just drifts superficially from topic to topic. There are accounts of necrophilia and necromancy that are gross, pornographic, and unedifying. Keep this book away from your kids. And don't read it while eating."
2,Very poorly written,"What a dissapointment, the writing is so bland and poor in this mediocre book I could barely get through it. After reading Stiff by Mary Roach, there is simply no comparison. The sentences in Cemetery Stories are choppy, the writing is bland and boring and nothing is cited so when you do find something interresting in the book, it ends there. Forget this book and read Stiff instead, a much more interresting and rewarding read."
3,Expected MORE,"Maybe I have a different book from the other reviewers, but I expected more from the master Cheiro. This is just a personality book of each number in Numerology (1-9). I have enough info on personality. That's why I brought this book; b/c the description at the top said ""health, diseases, cities..."" I did not see any thing about those things and if there were, it was probably only briefly mentioned once. One good thing was the writing is easy to understand; it's not some ancient mumbo-jumbo. As I said I was looking for more on Nuemerology as I already had info on personality, but ran into the same old thing with this book. Still this has not changed my view of Cheiro. I still reccommend anyone interested in numerology or numbers to get this."
2,A W- FULL,"Nobody even notices her, Ashilie's like an invisable singer.Her big sister Jessica, is even more better than her. I've know skinny homless puppy dogs that are even more noticable than her. { Joking} I meamn I like her, but everybody else treats like she's dead."
3,Well....,"We ordered the pants in size 32. The pants arrived and we really liked them, but they looked little small to me especially in the hip and thigh area. So, I was not surprised that we had to send them back for a larger size. I recommend that you order larger sizes than you normally would. We are trying a 34. Otherwise, we really did like them. I just wish someone would have told us they ran small and to get a larger size. It would have saved us some time and money."
3,Pretty good,"I'll admit that I am using this to power tactile transducers (bass shakers) in my theater, but I did mess around with it for a while as a stereo amp. It has good basic features and the sound was on par for the price. The remote is a bit light, and so are the configuration options and features, but then again, for about $100, it was a good deal. Definitely not for a high end system, or even a mid-level setup, but if you need to power a 2nd zone or just want something for non-critical listening in stereo, give it a look."
5,The little stereo that could,"Bought this receiver to drive a pair of Polk speakers in my attic office. The Sherwood brand has been highly regarded for over four decades, and was one of the leaders in the stereo heyday back in the 70's and 80's. This unit did not disappoint. For under $100, it features tons of inputs, a fully digital control panel, full featured remote, nice clean sound, and great presence and appearance. It even dims the panel light in low light conditions. Just an all around nice unit and great bargain."
4,Sherwood Receiver,I think my Sherwood is great and I enjoy it very much for my surround sound in my living room. I would have liked it to fit inside my console and it doesn't. htp//makeup4ever.com
4,Solid inexpensive stereo.,"A nice, inexpensive unit. Nothing flashy (which I appreciate). Would have given it 5 stars, but when I turned the unit on it blew out one of my expensive Bose speakers."
4,Just what we were looking for.,"If you are looking for a inexpensive receiver with plenty of coaxial connections, this if for you. Easy to set up. Remote works well through the glass of our entertainment unit."
5,Fantastic receiver for the price,It is a great receiver with many inputs to accommodate many different other stereo components. There are more than enough presets and I like the way it can handle modern components like an Ipod.
3,okay--I guess,"""Diamonds are Forever"" does what it sets ought to do: keeps you turning pages, let's you pretend to be the unflappable enigmatic spy. I don't see that James Bond does what he sets out to do in it, though. He never learns more than what the British Secret Service knew already. So he knocks off a few mobsters? They're easily replaced by their underlings, and, besides, mobsters themselves are always knocking off of few mobsters. (As Woody Allen says about intellectuals, they only kill their own.) I liked best the ocean liner cruise--as I liked best in ""From Russia with Love"" the train ride--, but it seems to me it would have made a lot more sense to fly. I suppose if you want logical, carefully constructed plots you shouldn't bother with James Bond, but this one strikes me as particularly hole-ridden. Oh, well.Recommended: John Le Carre's ""The Spy Who Came in from the Cold"" and his ""The Russia House""."
3,Slow for Bond; great moments of characterization worth it,"This book never really gets the momentum it needs (and clearly wants) as a thriller. I don't know what happened to Fleming, usually a master craftsman, during this one.On the other hand, the scenes of friendship between James and Felix are great, and so is the romance with Tiffany Case. Her traumatized, jaded characterization is very believable and heart-breaking. Bond is a very flawed, human character in the novel, and one can really identify with him and empathize with is wanting to help Tiffany, wanting the relationship to work, even though as readers, we know better.Not a good place to start on the Bond books, but for fans of the series, should definitely not be skipped."
4,James Bond is Forever!,"Not nearly as high-tech as the movie, but an excellent novel. Of the five Fleming Bond novels I've read so far, this one seemed to be (from a technical point-of-view) the best written. Wint and Kidd were much more of a threat in the novel than you would suspect after watching the movie.Picture the way Fleming describes the action when reading about Bond and Tiffany Case trying to survive a locomotive chasing them at about 60 miles an hour while they are out of petrol.I'm looking forward to reading From Russia With Love and the Penguin release of the other classic Bonds. Nobody does Bond better than Fleming!"
2,Could not see images on this GB console,"I purchased this item as a gift. With the reflective TFT screen,we (my son and I) could not see the images clearly in any angle and light (I tried). Trust me the picture you see on the website and on the boxes are 3 times asclear as the real thing.After asking several family friends, they said their children had the same problem and to get the sp version.I immediately returned item an purchased the GB SP. 150% better and the screen is as clear as the pictures on the box. With this much difference, I'm suprised that they still sell the otherversion.Get the SP console. It is worth the money."
2,With teeth,"I found Graham Joyce's writing simply gorgeous in its darkness and lush imagery. The story, however, felt unfocused. As I delved deeper into the novel, it seemed to become more and more prurient and distasteful, and all without a point. I did stop halfway through, so the final pages might have had something that tied it all together, but I just found that I didn't care about any of the characters. None were likeable, and the strange Tooth Fairy creature just didn't interest me enough to continue. I might pick up another of Joyce's books later though because his writing is magnificent."
1,Disappointed,"This book was a great disappointment to me. I love books that have a real setting and yet there is a touch of magic thrown in. Christopher Moore is a master at this type of narrative. He makes you feel as though YOU could stumble onto something mythical in your day to day life. ""The Tooth Fairy"" did not deliver this. This was a sexually twisted piece of writing. The book might have been more enjoyable if it had just given in to its erotic fixation fully and quit trying to be a creepy coming of age story. At the end of the book I had nothing invested in the story or the characters. The only reason I finished it was a misguided hope that the ending would reveal SOMETHING."
1,Really disappointing,"This is the first review that I have done on Amazon and I have been a long time customer. I just felt very mislead by the other reviews of this book. It was honestly one of the worst books I have ever read. The story was poorly written and was just disappointing on the whole. I actually threw the book away, because I don't want to pass this on for others to read."
4,A Good One!,This cd is pretty good its not the best but its worth getting. My favorite song on the album is track 3 stars would tell( Im crazy). Most of the songs are very well written and have a lot of passion in them. This cd is kinda of in the soft rock genre so if you like soft rock get it!
4,The Forbidden Kingdom,"with Jackie Chan and Jet Li, this movie is outstanding. it's got an original story line of master and young apprentice. great for the whole family. if you are a martial arts fan, buy this move. they make a good team and i hope they work together again for another movie."

5,Great movie,"Great movie. I am a huge Jackie Chan fan so if you are not, well I am not going to be of help to you. Jackie Chan is not the center of attention but he does do his usual great work along with Jet Li. The story is well told and makes for a compelling movie. It takes some of the wondrous parts of chinese stories about the Monkey King to create its own story that completely entertains you."
4,Interesting Movie,"Kind of like karate kid but with a little more violence than I was expecting. Even though it's rated PG13, I wouldn't feel comfortable showing to my grandkids under age of 13."
3,Forbidden Kingdom,"It was a great movie for my 8 year old son to watch...The action wasn't ""over the top"" violent and the storyline / purpose had a great moral exampleA little ""low budget"", on some of the sepcial effects, but he didn't mind."
3,Weak acting ruin what should have been a better movie,The Forbidden Kingdown is a decent one time watch but it really isn't anything worth watching again and again (unless you want to see the Jet Li and Jakie Chan fight scene over and over). The action and fight scenes are pretty good. The plot is weak but doable. It's the acting that really ruins this movie. I thought Jackie Chan was awful. His scenes pretending to be drunk were awful. He just totally didn't pull it off. I thought the main kid in this movie was pretty bad himself and the girl that followed the three guys around was pretty forgetable herself.You'd think if you could afford Jackie Chan and Let Li that that they would be able to attract other actors who at least took some acting classes but that apparently was not the case.Watch it once and then forget about it. It will be real easy to do.
1,Very boring!,"I like movies made by both Jackie Chan and Jet Li and are a fan of both of them because they are a few of the martial arts movie star who really know martial arts, just like Bruce Li. It is amazing that until this movie they had never made a movie together. Therefore I was quite excited when I heard about this movie and had read about it in Chinese magazine a year ago. Recently, I finally got hold a copy of it and to my chagrin it bored me to death. The plot is horrible, Jackie Chan talked too much, while the fighting scenes between him and Jet Li are not bad but the movie just did not go any where. I passed out in the middle of the movie and could not finish watching it. No wonder this movie is now on sales everywhere and is indeed cheaper than a used one."
4,Awesome show,"I love this show and the extended episodes on the dvd. The special features are a good extra, but I wish there was commentary on some episodes with the cast."
4,GOT IT!!!,got these bluray discs fairly quick and in great shape. No complaints.Thought of buying these at BestBuy but opted to get it at Amazon instead for a great deal.Thanks...
5,fantasy football,the league what can I say about one of my favorite shows....well calling all fantasy football fans....the show funny with two f s....this DVD geat gift for someone special on your list..
5,Deserves 6 stars..!!!,"Funniest show on TV right now, HANDS DOWN.!!! If I could I would give it 6 stars.!! Hilarious character interaction, smart and witty humor. Can be raunchy though, that's what I love about it. These guys rip each other at every opportunity..as good friends should!Their Fantasy Football Competetive spirit knows no bounaries as they will stoop to any level to, 'one-up' each other(like ""trade-raping"" ea. other)on their way to the Shiva-Bowl(Their Fantasy-League Superbowl)!Excellent guest stars from the NFL throughout the series, like Chad ""Child-Please"" Ochocinco, Ladanian Tomlinson, and Terry Bradshaw, among others. If ur into NFL Football at all, you've got to get this show on DVD..! Best new show in a lonnng time!"
3,A little dated.,"This is a product of the '70's femnist revolution, so it's a little dated. I'm a 17-year-old lesbian, and a lot of the things in here don't really apply anymore. Back then, women were with women just so that the men wouldn't overpower them -- now, we've realized (I hope) that men have nothing to do with being gay; it's just about loving women.I would reccommend ""Annie On My Mind"" for a great fiction romance story. If you're looking for coming out tips or self-esteem boosters, I reccommend ""Family Outing"" by Chastity Bono and ""Love, Ellen"" by Betty DeGeneres."
1,Aspect ratio issues streaming this on Tivo,"I can't give this a good review due to the technical issues. There seemed to be some issue with the aspect ratio. I have never seen a movie display like this one did. I wanted my money back, but had no way of figuring out how to do it. Hopefully it streams correctly on other systems."
5,I love Chinotto,"I first tasted Chinotto when I was in Australia and became addicted. Despite looking like a cola drink, it's made from the Chinotto orange. The orange is often described as having a ""bitter"" taste. I liken the Chinotto flavor to the aperitif Campari, but non-alcoholic!Chinotto is my favorite drink and I hope it gets back in stock very soon."
2,Samurai Empire,The game is ok its just the company that puts it out..I ordered several CD.s had to retreive the darn soul stone from Amazon Locker and then....only one code showed up!!!!!! suppose to be a code for each game that one orders..what a rip off..I dont think its worth it to get the expansion pack..save your money!!!
4,The Weirdos are the first LA punk band. It's a must see!,"John Denny lead singer) was a great performer in his day. In 1977 The Weirdos had a huge LA following. The only thing that compared to their music was the outfits they wore. This video is nothing like the 77 days but at least it exists to show their fans what they were like in the ole days. Also, they were a huge influence on The Red Hot Chillie Peppers."
3,"Nice to wear, a few times...","A decent smell, but strong, a little goes a long way, lasts a long time, and tires quickly on the nares. I ended up giving the bottle to a friend."
2,The only gold in this stream is the list of 25 frames.,"Most of the information in this book can be found in many others. His ""exercises"" may be unique, but I seen similar exercises else where. His list of 25 frames in the chapter on making choices is a real gem. I suspect that for many writers this section of the book will make it worth the purchase price."
5,"Perfect for the serious, committed writer!","""Deep Writing"" has become my greatest ally since I read it. I've just left the corporate world after 22 years and launched into a passionate new career as a writer of novels and short stories. My analytical background means I have the biggest ""How To Write"" bookshelf I've ever found - I read everything! Many books are very helpful. But ""Deep Writing"" is the book that has most directly addressed how to structure my writing life and how to align my writing with my creativity. This book seems to speak most clearly about my issues, and the suggested tactics are 100% practical. I'm a raving fan of the book and intend to buy a number of copies to give to writing friends."
2,NOT REALLY COMFY..,LOOKS CUTE BUT NOT COMFY I HAVE WIDE FEET I GOT A SIZE BIGGER AND STILL IT WAS NOT COMFY..DON'T LIKE IT SORRY
5,Among the best Japanese singers ever.,"Forget Hamasaki. Forget Nakashima. Forget all those whiny, annoying voices you often hear from Jpop artists. Sowelu's a real deal. I first heard of Sowelu when I was visiting Japan and listening to J-Wave FM radio station, and I was totally mesmerized by her smooth, yet powerful voice. She's very versatile as a singer. She can do R&B; flawlessly, sings a jazzy tune on ""Candy Rain"" (a Toshi Kubota classic), and sounds so powerful on ballad.There are no fillers on this album. I fully recommend it even to people who doesn't understand Japanese lyrics.Sowelu even sounds better on her second full-length album ""Sweet Bridge"". I wish Amazon should starts carrying more Japanese acts.If you're really serious about listening ""grown-up"" Jpop (none of those bubble-gum pop or anime-themed music), you better pick up Sowelu and R&B;/Hip-hop sister duo Soulhead."
2,starts awful. gets better.,"Sorry to say but the pilot episode of Haven was just awful. I'm not really sure why I kept tuning in to watch the subsequent episodes, but I'm glad I did. As the season progressed, the show significantly improved. So, watch this episode keeping in mind that things will get better - Not in Haven, mind you, where things will deteriorate up to the dramatic conclusion of season 1. Can't wait to see what happens in Season 2."
4,Excellent Show,"I would have given this product a 5 except for one thing...packaging. I love the show itself and its never a dull moment. I was dissappointed in the inner packaging and how the discs are held in place. The discs are hard to get in and out because of the way they are packaged. Its hard to explain. You have to slide the disc down really hard to get it below the two side holders. There is always the fear of scratching, chipping or even breaking the disc. A great show like this should be treated as such in all aspects. The second season discs are stacked two each on top of each other with a spindle which is better. I would still recommend Haven highly to anyone that loves paranormal mystery and intrigue."
2,And I thought this type of thing only happened in rural Mississippi.,"I decided to write this review in the form of a horribly constructed poem. Here goes.Raymond is forced to stay at home for the summerWanting an internship instead, he considers this a bummerHis mother's hurt, and needs his help, and drives young Raymond crazyHe's forced to take care of her, or else she calls him lazyThen one day while putting ointment on her legRaymond feels a bizarre feeling rising within his southern hedgeThe rest, my friends, will leave you shocked, when at last you seeThat Raymond's got the hots for mom, and yes, his mother biologically(take that Walt Whitman)This film is completely absurd and I cannot recommend it. That doesn't mean I haven't watched it sixteen times in the last year alone on IFC, however."
2,Didn't interest me,"I found this book boring. Her message was good, but her delivery did nothing for me."
4,Beautiful Color,The color is beautiful and covers my roots. It lasted about three weeks before it began to fade. I would recommend this product. I will probably purchase it again.
1,Outrageous,I got my order (Incase Designs PDA Pouch). Very decrepit looking. What nerve to sell something in that kind of (poor) condition. It is never a good idea to be so dishonest because it will always come back to you in the end.
4,Get It Krunk,"To be honest when I first heard the title of this album I thought it was going to be the usual crunk type southern rap music. I was wrong not to sat that anything is wrong with above mentioned brand of music. It's just Get It Krunk is on a whole different level as shown by songs like ""Come See"", which is the first song on the cd and is a definite banger. ""When We Ride"" is another hot song that will no doubt get the dance floor jumping with the catchy hook, slick rhymes, and killer beat. You are definitely going to love this cd."
5,Dying Fetus Reign Supreme,"I have yet to find a band that combinds the best elements of death metal, grindcore, punk, and math metal that can beat Dying Fetus. Dying Fetus is just one of those bands that are one in a million, and 'Killing On Adrenaline' proves this. Not only does Dying Fetus have the best vocalist of all time, their guitarists will rip you in half. The title track has got to one of the best and faster songs of all time. I mean, you have got to love lyrics like ""They are the ones that ... with me, they paid the price with agony, as the force from anger erupts out from deep inside of me, not a ... chance to live just you bleeding..."". This is by far their greatest song of all time. And not to metion the best song of all time. Other honoralbe mentions are ""Forncation Terrorists"" and ""We Are Your Enemy"". How this band became so good, I have no idea, but for God's sake, the will always rock the hardest."
5,Absolute Defiance,"Who ever knew such grinding brutality could come out of Maryland. As far as I'm concerned Dying Fetus is the best grinding metal band out today. Always sounded to me like the blended Suffocation's speed with Internal Bleeding's thick and nasty riffs to create songs that make you want to SMASH and BREAK. Killing On Adreniline never leaves the rotation in my CD player. It is one of the best releases of the new wave of underground metal. I love the screaming and the real deep gutteral vox, they mix them up perfectly. I'm glad to see Relapse added them to there roster. Do yourself a favor, if you like grind and death pick this CD up, no way in hell will it let you down."
5,One of the two best books for writers...,"There are two books that I keep right next to my desk. This is one of them. The other is John Kremer's 1001 Ways to Market Your Books. If you are a writer, you MUST have both!"
3,Good for novices.,"This is a fine introduction but your money will be better spent buying Newspaper Production Using Pagemaker 7 by Gordon Woolf, Adobe Pagemaker 6.5 Plus and Adobe Pagemaker Classroom In A Book Pagemaker."
2,Great Idea....Poor Design,"Like others said the light will not stay attached to the carseat base. Everytime you get the seat out it falls off. The light is not super bright which is good and bad. Good cause it doesnt wake baby, bad cause it makes it hard to see with. The mirror that you put on the back window works great and I still have it in my car.My advice would be to save your money and just use your dome light."
1,A dude in so many ways,"Skip on this product. Unless the interior of your car / van is a perfect square, it is almost impossible to attach the mirror in an angle to let you see your child. The light, a nice idea, is poorly implemented making it worthless and in the way when taking your seat in and out of the car, plus the remote that turns light on and off must be in direct line of sight or it won't work, and finally the clip to hold the remote on your sun visor won't fit many types of cars with thicker visors that house vanity mirrors and the like."
2,"Just get a mirror, light not worth it","Great idea, just a few gliches. Light must be in the ""on"" position to work so you have to remember to turn it on at night. Remote control only works half the time and light only stays on for about 5 seconds, too short for me. Also light must attach to car seat base and it gets in the way when you're putting baby seat in it. I discovered reaching up and turning on my dome light in the car is just as effective and a lot easier. Mirror works great and gives me peace of mind to see that my baby is doing okay. Save a few bucks and just buy a mirror."
3,Different at 46,My boyfriend saw this when he was six years old (forty years ago). Said he had nightmares for years. We watched it again tonight and had a good laugh.
2,So...,"I bought this album looking for a Beefeaters (Dischord band) CD, but instead I got this thing. So I listened to it anyway. It sucks. Basically unimaginative, dated music. Don't buy this album."
3,Ages are off...,"This is okay, but her ages are off. They are kind of pretending to know all this stuff about her, when they have it all off. She moved to Nashville at 13, not 14. She was moved after being signed with a development deal at RCA at age 13, turning it down after doing it for a year- 'till 14. She was playing Bluebird Cafe at age 14, and she got signed to Scott Borchetta at age 14. Her ALBUM came out when she was 16, she got SIGNED at 14. They need to confirm their info before putting it onto DVD, because the info they are giving with things isn't quite correct."
5,shipping overcharge,"As I wrote you recently, there was an exorbitant amount charged for shipping this order. I have received no response from either you or the vendor about my complaint, but I question if I can afford to do business through you if it's going to subject me to excessive shipping costs.Again, I would appreciate a response.Thank you.Sam Lapkin"
3,ok,this book was ok but it was difficult to stay focused because of the massive amounts of imagery... it was interesting though.
5,Hydro Grind For the Masses!!!!,"This is a landmark in grinding death metal. The 'phalic have become a truly unique outfit. If you like SUFFOCATION, BRUTAL TRUTH and .......say.........a slice of improv jazz......u shall dig this!"
1,Utterly Worthless!!!,"This book has No English Listing of the French idioms contained in this book! Thus you can't find any idiom whatsoever that you don't know about already! And if you know it, you don't need this book. In no doubt unidiomatic French, ce livre est tres mal! Don't waste your money."
5,Honest and Insightful,"A well-written, honest, insightful book. Dave Pallone should be congratulated on his work, both as a professional in the baseball world and as a first time author. In the same ""boat"" as Dave Kopay, Pallone rises above and allows the reader to feel and to be ok with being who you are."
2,Mediocre Riding Representation,"The horses in this game are shocking! I have never seen a horse with such choppy gaits, you get sea sick just looking at it! Horses may not have suspension, but a horse would never make an eventer with gaits like that- think of the terrible scores they'd get in the dressage! The 'Adventure' section was better, riding around the trails was amusing enough."
2,Not great for the younger player,"My daughter is seven, and she's pretty darned good at most computer games. She loves horses (not up close and personal, though), so her dad bought Saddle Up for her. She got the hang of riding the courses and doing the grooming tasks fairly quickly... but I think she's too young to solve the ""challenges"" in the game. And I'm just a dumb mommy, which means I'm no help at all.The manufacturer's website offers NO hints at all. And the customer discussion forum is just full of comments from people who couldn't get the game loaded.Many of the happy reviewers here seem to be teenagers. I would advise, dear parent, that you avoid buying this game if your kidlet is around the age of my own. She does enjoy the riding and grooming, but since we can't seem to get any further into the ""adventure"" side of the story, she has gotten bored and rather frustrated. Me, too!"
4,Fun Fun Fun,"This is a really cool game even for me and I'm 16! Yea Its sad I know but I wanted a good horse game, I beat the Barbie Riding Game in less than an hour. So I was happy when I still haven't been Saddle Up and ive had it for almost a month!The grooming can be really annoying after a while but its alot like real life. Picking there feet takes like 15 mintues the first time. The challanges are HARD! I still haven't figured out the wheel challange and its making me very mad!! But I still love it!"
2,"Not embedded C, but 8051 microcontroller programming","I read in another review that this book has the wrong title. I fully agree. This book is not about C programming, but about how to program a 8051 microcontroller. If that's what you want, this is a good book for you. But you will not learn about embeddeded C programming."
1,Dud,"This dictionary has fewer words, fewer indications of regional usage, and fewer definitions than previous editions of the University of Chicago Spanish Dictionary, which earlier editions are now historical monuments rather than the peculiarly useful works they once were, as their focus on Latin American usage is now not so unusual as it was. It's not clear what the publishers were thinking; there may have been some desire to get away from the somewhat academic air of the earlier Chicago dictionaries.What should the student use instead? Just about anything of reasonable compass; I'd recommend the larger Larousse dictionaries, to start with."
3,Disappointing !,"Despite what the title may suggest, this book is far from complete ! Many places and important synagogues have been omited. So don't expect information on little-known (but sometimes gem-like) synagogues or former synagogues. This guide is handy for tourists on a two-week tour of France who want to visit a few Jewish sights while there. This is certainly not an in-depth study of France's Jewish monuments but it gives a good overview of the main places to visit. Of the places Mrs Kamins describes, a plus are the contact addresses and/or telephone numbers, so you can plan your visit and thus avoid standing in front of closed doors."
5,Spokey Dokes!,These are fun! My husband and I bought a pack and put them on our bike's back wheels and the kids trailer. All the funky bright colors were for the kids! If you have extra you can share them with your other bike buddies! They are fun and cheap!
5,Awesome accessory,"This was a great throwback for me. I put these bad boys on in record time, and there were enough for me to share them with my boyfriend and little sister! Im not sure that I will be able to get them off and re-use them ever, but I guess thats good security for them not falling off anytime soon either!"
4,Not Just For Kids!,"If you've ever spent any time on bike paths, you know that getting the attention of pedestrians is somewhat of a difficulty, especially when they're engaged in conversation, and walking four abreast so that you cannot pass them. For some reason shouting ""Excuse me!"" rarely works. Bells and horns are a little over the top. Spoke beads are the answer! I know, they look a little goofy on a $700 adult-owned bicycle BUT they make no noise at speed. At 3mph and slower they slide around on the spokes and make a very strange clanking noise, and it makes people turn around to see what it is! Then they clue in and move out of your way. PRICELESS. I only wish they were reflective, or glowed in the dark, or did anything else for conspicuity."
5,Awesome,"This album is incredible. If you like laying down, maybe lighting some incense and just relaxing this is the album for you. No vocals, but still awesome nonetheless. THe guitar is consistently good the whole way through. If you have 20 bucks, buy this album, if you dont buy it anyway."
5,Love this scent for the last 35 years,"This is the ""cleanest"" scent. I always get compliments .Not one of those ""Too much"" scents. What happened to the Grey flannel powder? I used it in my salon as a talc after a hair cut. Is it gone forever? Seems I've been looking forever. I also am not a fan of the ""new"" Grey Flannel in the turquoise bottle. The original is the Best!"
1,Another gimmick?,"Can anyone verify if this is even supposed to work in theory? We're about half way through our money back guarantee, and I'm pretty sure we are sending this one back. No change in our water whatsoever."
1,Don't see a difference,I have had this installed on my water system for quite sometime now (Maybe a year?)and I really don't notice a difference. I can't say for sure that it does anything.
1,ClearWave water conditioner?,I purchased the Clearwave conditioner about 2 years ago through Amazon. Our water is hard about 20 grains. The ad suggested that you needed to give the unit at least 90 days before deciding whether it was working. Well 2 years later we can't see any difference. I talked to an electrician about the unit and when I described one terminating wire from each end that wraps around the pipes he just laughed. Without a completed circuit there is no way a magnetic field can be built. Therefore this product has no chance of working as described. I contacted Amazon and they refunded the entire price.
5,"So far, so good ...","WE installed on of these water softeners on our house plumbing back on October 30th, 2011 and so far, we love it's effects ...Right away we noticed the water was different in the shower, shampoo and soap suds up more ...Laundry is softer, the hot water heats up a full 25 degrees more now ...Cooking has changed too, no more deposits in the pots while boiling water ...THe hard water effects on the faucets, etc are all but gone too ...Again, very pleased so far ..."
2,Scratches Easily,Loved this when we 1st received it as a shower gift....but then we tried to wipe it clean with a paper towel & it Scratched BADLY. This therefore frosted up the mirror & you couldn't see a thing in it. Nothing could correct the problem. What a waste of money. If you can't clean it then what is the point??
2,not a good fit,this mirror was difficult to secure to the back seat head rest and we never really could get it tight enough not to slip. it kept slipping down. the straps are a little flimsy.
4,we have 2,"forget those small mirrors they sell in pairs with suction cups, they are so small it is almost impossible to get them to line up just right and the suction doesnt stay for very long. this mirror however is nice and BIG and so easy to install and position, we have one for each car and love them. getting it to stay put is a problem and it needs re-positioning more often then expected."
5,A must-have baby item,This is my absolute favorite item! It is so great to be able to glance in the rear view mirror and see what my little guy is doing! Is he awake? Sleeping? Fussing? I can tell in just a second. It's also great because he can entertain himself just by watching himself in the mirror!
1,not safe?,"I had purchased two of these mirrors for my car and my husband's.However, after taking our 4 day old baby to the fire station to have our infant car seat professionally checked over, we were told that these mirrors are not recommended and that they can actually harm your child in a car accident.We returned them immediately! Please check your baby products out."
4,Intriguing and Insightful,"It was a very interesting book! I had no idea the U.S. Air Force hunted NVA convoys on the Ho Chi Minh trail. Also, he gave us a perspective from the enemy. A must read!"
4,pretty good,"Of course no one is going to pay the $7 shipping charge, but if you see it in the store it's fairly tasty, and certainly more nutritious than most."
5,Yum!,"Prior to finding this on Amazon (why didn't I look here first?), I could only find this in one local gas station (which is out of the way mind you). Nowhere else.Sad =(.Then one day it dawned upon me to look on Amazon, and of course, here it is! This has to be my absolute favorite soda. It is extremely sour... but with just the right amount of punch. From what I've seen, however, you either like it - or you don't. And if you like it, you love it!Definitely try to purchase one locally offline before getting this six pack and finding out you don't like it. Or, buy the six pack and give the rest to someone who does!"
4,Refreshing,"I would have preferred the drink to be less tart, but if that's what you like it is an excellent product."
4,It's just a great album.,"This album is the reissue of Polvo's 1990 original double 7"". My oh my have they come along way. It's a great record full of heart, emotion and innovation. Far superior to Cor-Crane Secret even though it is far shorter. In-fact, I would rank this album above Celebrate the New Dark Age and Today's Active Lifestyles. This album is solid start to finish. If you are a Polvo Fan this is a must!"
4,Pretty good,"To even give E. sermon one star is a disgrace....this album isnt bad at all. It has the tight beats and tight flows that sermon has been known for. not too many guest appearances either, I guess if your into all the g..g..g..g-unit then this is not the album for you."
5,Handsome!,"I am a professional interior designer and have had this set for about two years. Love the clean lines and simplicity of the design. I would have to disagree with the reviewer who said the ""hot"", ""cold"" are ""flowery"". To my eye they are quite subtle and not at all large. They are on one side and are outlined in elongated teardrop shapes... a bit like a slender paisley shape. Handsome, sturdy and solidly functional set!"
5,Great for my 2nd grader,We saw the film and my son loved it. I bought this as a way for him to learn of Tin Tin's next adventure. I was not sure if it was too dated to hold his interest. He really enjoyed the book and very quickly read the whole thing. The print quality and page size was perfect. I love the illustrations. I will be buying more of these!
3,Uneven.,"There are some fine moments on this cd. but it lacks spark and focus. Jav-Lyn does a cover of Betty Wright's song Tonight is the Night, but Betty Wright has no need to worry, her version and before song patter was much better and original! I enjoyed Lady Lotion's Damn you eyes,and Chonita Turner's Baby I love you. But their limp Rolling on the River never catches fire."
2,"great idea, but...","I bought this to child proof the stove. It's a great idea, but I couldn't get the guard to stay up. The adhesive always came off the stove and the guard hung down making it ineffective in what it is supposed to do, which is to keep little hands from reaching up to touch the burners. I was extremely disappointed."
1,Not worth the money!,"I have a gas range, and wanted to protect my little one from the flames should they figure out how to get arround the child proofing and turn on the gas.This was not difficult to install, but it fell off the next day. the sticky pads say that they will stick if you wash the surface prior to installing them. I did that, and I waited for it to dry just like the directions said to do.Dont bother buying this one. spend a couple extra $$ and get a better one."
3,Necklace Knot,Opened the package to find the necklace as one big knot. Necklace was of decent quality for the money but was a pain to get out of the knot it was in.
2,This is Asome!,"I think that Lincoln Park is going to be of the biggest rappers ever. He is SO awesome!!! His first album, Meteora, is the all-time best R&B ballad CD and my favorite album from 1980. Then, he came out with Reanimation, a very cool CD that sounded very britney-spears style, but his voice sounded very much like the voice of the lead singer of Ryan Cabrera, who's debut album is coming out in 2007. His next album,Hybrid Theory is the best. I personally think that in this album Mr. Park improved alot. It is the best remix album I have ever heard. I want to get the newest album, the Hybrid theory EP, which I hear is a must-own for fans of this wonderful person. Long Live Mr. Lincoln Park."
3,Relive your youth,"I grew up in New York City and during the time frame that the author reminisces about. There really does not seem to be a story, just a bunch of ""remembrances"" that don't seem to be connected."
1,Skip the book!,"""A Christmas Story"" is one of my favorite holiday films, so I expected to enjoy the book that inspired it. Instead, I hated ""In God We Trust.""Shepherd's writing is devoid of rhythm or beauty. The sentences, bogged down with far too many adjectives, limp along like bits of a fourth-grade theme paper.Shepherd is a hateful, bitter man. Slurs and offensive characterizations pepper the book and poison any of the sweetness that can be found in the movie version. There's plenty of hoary, old man humor about alcoholism and drunkenness too, the kind that better writers abandoned sometime in the early sixties.Reading this book felt like being cornered by a drunken, unwashed, polyester-clad uncle at a holiday party. One feels polluted afterward. If there were a way to cleanse, or even excise the brain cells that hold my memory of this book, I would."
4,In God We Trust. All Others Pay Cash,"After seeing ""Ollie Hopnoddle's Haven of Bliss"" on PBS T.V. several years ago, I thought back on Jean Sheppard and his radio show Jean Sheppard's America. Then I faintly remembered his work in Car & Driver back in the late '70's. This was after he left WOR radio I guess? The Christmas Story and other works he did on PBS still bring back memories of growing up in the midwest in the 50's. Then I bought the two Sheppard books and have my 12 year old daughter experiencing the joy of Jean Sheppard. His death recently is a loss to all of us who grew up in the inocent years."
4,Saw at Tribeca!,Finally!! I've been waiting for this DVD to come out! I saw this film at the Tribeca Film Fest in 06 (I think it won an award). This film had the audience in complete awe. This is a very touching story and whether you are a fan of Hip Hop or not you will thoroughly enjoy it.
3,"Great Idea, But ...",Nice product - a great idea. This one is not very sturdy. It is prone to flexing making it less than ideal in use
3,Extremely Far-Fetched,"Arizona state police allow (and silently condone) Spenser gathering together a posse of homicidal thugs to do battle over a little town? Yeah, right.Once again Spenser decides pretty and sexy must equal innocence. And when the truth is reveal, he allows homical pretty and sexy to walk away scot free.His writing ability is still excellent, but I think his age is affecting his ability to creat reasonable scenarios. Too bad."
3,Ocean's Eleven Spenser Style,"Although I have read all the Spenser novels from the time they were first published, and I love the books and the characters like old friends, this book is so thin and lightweight that it's almost not there. Parker has gotten increasingly lazy and simplistic, plot-wise and character-wise, particularly in recent years and, when one looks back to the early books, the difference is super clear. While someone like Robert Crais only gets stronger and better, and James Lee Burke maintains his high level of writing throughout his Robicheaux series, Parker is running out of gas. He's writing on fumes."
2,Phoning it in.,"Parker is a good writer, but I think he's fairly clearly bored with this series. It felt gimmicky and contrived and used irony in place of a plot.Not a good place to begin if you don't know the better books in the series."
2,Less There There Than Usual,"Even given that the Spenser stories are confections, ephemeral in nature, and not to be too closely examined for structure and logic, this latest offering is way, way too airy. The collecting of all the other (non-Spenser) tough guys from previous books to give our hero a hand in his latest endeavour is an intriguing idea, but once Parker's got them together, he provides little for them to do, and his disinterest becomes manifest very quickly. Die-hard Spenser fans - and I am one - will be left feeling more unsatisfied than usual."
3,"There are no bad Spenser books, but...","For me, the key to enjoying a Spenser book is simply not to take it at all seriously. I've always loved Parker's dialogue, although it would be beyond miraculous to find as many truly glib, dry, clever people in one time zone, let alone the city of Boston. The more I read about Potshot, the more eagerly I looked forward to getting my hands on it. The idea of bringing together so many of Parker's quirky angels with dirty faces was intriguing. Then the book arrived. And I read it. And right near the end, Parker essentially said, ""...and then there was a lot of shooting and everyone went home."" Rats. I've never read a bad Spenser novel, but this one was a let-down. Perhaps Mr. Parker should devote more time to his two new protagonists, Sunny and Jesse."
1,Didn't work at all,This product didn't work and was a total waste of money--at least for me. I could still easily turn the knobs (and turn on the stove) after putting on the 'loks'. Our stove is a standard brand installed in newer homes but this product may work for other brands. I ended up throwing these in the trash. If you buy the product make sure you keep the receipt.
2,Not quite,"If you are looking for a book that reflects Dorothy Sayers wit and interest, this is not it. I could not finish this book and found myself wishing it were over. I bought it hoping for one last, wonderful Sayers novel. It was pure hope. I do not recommend this book to you."
3,A different style from the originals,"I was sincerely looking forward to revisiting Peter, Harriet, Parker and the rest as I love the other Peter Wimsey books and own them all. While the characters are there, the feel of the original is missing, and not only is the writing style here busier - it seems to be trying to analyze the characters far more than we need to. The relationships seem more distant than previous and the characters far more superficial.I don't think it's a spoiler to mention there's no mystery and no Bunter in the first quarter of the book.If you'd like to see a totally different author write about Lord Peter and his family and associates, this book is worth a look. If you're hoping to recapture the actual style and substance of Dorothy Sayer's books and characters, better re-read the originals and skip this one entirely."
3,Walsh too dominating,"While all the characters were true to Dorothy Sayers originals, writer Jill Walsh imposed too much distracting side explanation and slowed the flow of the story several times in this ""co-authorship"" with the deceased Sayors. A case of Walsh trying too hard to make her impact upon the book."
2,"no, it's just not the same","we need to all accept that Dorothy Sayers has died and we won't ever have any new Peter Wimsey books from her. This book just isn't as good as Dorothy Sayers. The pity is that the new author tried to write in Dorothy Sayers's voice, and it just doesn't work. I think it would have been better if the woman had just written the newer stories about the Wimseys in her own voice. The book would have been better that way. Same Wimseys, different story teller, different point of view."
4,Bird Flu in America,A good movie that shows how pandemic diseases spread expotentially. As the movie progressed it became rather unrealistic and inconsistent in certain areas.
3,Expecting More,"I was expecting more from this book. It's great if the main surnames are in your family history. Otherwise, most of the information are things you can easily find online."
4,Average,"This is an awesome ball game. But a few things aren't. The comentarie Stinks. Really it does. And fielders never get a jump on the ball so youre always runing. don't get me wrong, because besides that its asewome"
3,Good theology but tough reading,"This book came highly recommended, but I was not as impressed. Os shared important theology and what he has to say is certainly worth hearing. However, I didn't like the he quoted Friedrich Nietzsche more often than the Bible. I almost thought this was Os's attempt to write a book on Christian theology without quoting the Bible.Os could make a great contribution to the average Christian's understanding of his or her calling from God, but I don't think this book is going to do it."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Those human type people have been given the boot from their originalhome planet. They now live on various other bodies in space, bothnatural and artificial.A Central Computer runs things for people, and diseases, longevityand other issues are no problem for the technology available to fix.The plot here is that despite this nice place to live, people are topping themselves, so why?Amusing at times, offering a commentary on the possibility that people need something to do."
2,"Some Interesting ideas, but...","Overall it was an effort to finish reading because I repeatedly had little sense of direction for the novel. Characters come and go and the main character Hildy often does things, such as change sexes, that only seem like gimmicks. Many times he skips around to an overindulgent and annoying extent. I didn't find him overly sympathetic or interesting. However, It is interesting to think that people and even a supercomputer could become depressed as life becomes too easy as everything is taken care of down to morning breath. This is the only Varley book I've read to date. I get the sense from the way many chapters read like episodes, he may be a better short story writer."
5,This had always been my aboslute favorite book ever!,"Sure there are many wonderful books out there, but I never got so into one as Steel Beach. I read it twice. Once three years ago, and again last year. The second time around was twice as good as the first. I highly recommend it along with his other works to any reader, sci-fi fan or not. It brings up more issues than years of news and documentarys and seriously gets you thinking."
3,"It's not bad, but it's not Varley.","I've read a lot of Varley's older work, and while this is set in one of his ""universes"", the tone is very different, very much more mass-market. One of the strong points of his previous stories is that along with the changes in technology there were significant changes in cultural views. For example, he had one of his characters compare the validity of fatherhood with that of the divine right of kings, showing how alien his humans are in some ways. But in _Steel Beach_, the characters might as well have been transplanted from down the street, and this makes the stories plebeian. All in all, it's not terrible, but it just isn't Varley. I recommend that you pass on this and go for his older, more original writings"
4,"A little scattered, but worth a close look.","_Steel Beach_ can be a little scattered, but if one is willing to look between the lines I believe he has some interesting things to say about our society. Varley has a unique way of writing women characters- stong, passionate, independent, complete with historical context that helps us understand the person they have become. His gender definitions are more fluid that most, which results in characters that have depth and intersting tapestries of life. _Steel Beach_ is a detailed example of this perspective. While the plot line jumps sporadically, meaningful messages are appreciated by this reader."
5,Book review,"A very enjoyable read. The simplicity of his ideas is refreshing. I do believe it really can be this simple. This small pocket size book is easy to fit into a bag/purse, or pocket and take with you wherever you go. I find spending a few minutes here and there reading it works well. Pleasant and easy to follow. Seems like a very sincere person."
4,Kaleigh love's it,My grandchild Kaleigh is 7 years old and considers herself an expert on dolls. When she saw this one she said she just had to have it so I bought 1 for her and 1 for her cousin Sara. They love this doll and spent the entire week-end playing it. This particular doll really seems to bring out the imaginative play in little girls and she really is cute. Recently they spent another week-end at our house and these are the dolls they bought with them. I'm not a Bratz fan but realize that most girls are and if a toy can provide this many hours of entertainment that it has to be a must have for girls in this age range anyway.
3,OMG,How can someone say something that they don't like dark skin. It is a very racist and that review should be taken off the site because its offensive and wrong
5,My dream!,"Ok, MY dream is for this doll is to have her rescue wild and pet animals. and have her have a partner horse to take her places, and they are also best freinds 4 ever! they travel around the world together :)than along the way,she see's a hot boyfriend at the park when she takes her horse. she meets him and they tell eachother about them. they are soon boyfreind and girl friend and they live happily ever aterTHE END (MAYBE)"
5,GEORGEOUS !!!!,"this doll is GEORGEOUS (...) NEVRA finally with her own clothes.But one thing on his doll sucks is her earringes broked verry fast,but the most importent is the GEORGEOUS (...) doll."
4,Very chew-able!,My two ferrets love it but it started getting chewed on the moment I put it in their play pen. So far they only chew the ends but they shredded them very quickly. I doubt it will last more then a month but they enjoy it so much I will probably just have to keep replacing it.
4,Crazy happy,My ferrets love this product! They never get bored with and always insist on chasing each other through it. At first they didn't like it because I wrapped it to tightly around chair legs and they couldn't turn that tight AND go fast. When I kept it simple with a few loose turns they went crazy happy!
5,Exquisite,"As someone once said, ""I don't know much about art, but I know what I like.""These nocturnes are exquisite! They bring peace."
2,"A major disapointment ""In Tuscany"".","In contrast to the previous reviewers, I found this book one the larger disappointments of the past year. I anxiously awaited this title, after reading and rereading Under the Tuscan Sun and Bella Tuscany. The prose that I found endearing in full chapters becomes trite and overproduced in smaller chunklets. I further find that pages and pages of artfully blurry photographs add little to the book. As far as the recipes go, your money is better spent on a good Italian cookbook. This book adds little to the continuing story of life in Tuscany, and that is the reader's loss. Not recommended."
4,Wonderful Frances Mayes - but watch the recipes,"Love this book and all her books - I re-read them just for the relief her warm and upbeat world view gives, and the lush use of words! I just want to comment on the recipes though because I have tried a couple and some things didn't make sense or turn out as described even though I'm a compulsive recipe-follower. Read carefully, make a smaller batch first..."
2,Handsome model but...,"I'm a fan of a well built men and this guy is that. There's plenty of nudity and he looks good. However the film is boring, just a whole lot of standing or being shown how to pose by the very intrusive photographer - who even offers suggestions on how to shave! It fails to create any sense of excitemnt about the shoot or the model. 2 stars for the model, nothing for the film. Dont waste your money."
3,Great first bongos,"My son loves these bongos. They are the perfect size for him. The bongos I received had a different design on them than the one in the picture---a southwestern design with a lizard--but they still look good. The quality is not as sturdy as the bongos with pigskin or leather hide(I think that's what's used), but they look as if they'll last with normal wear and tear."
5,A TERRIC READ!,"A wonderful story about a woman with an eating disorder. It takes the reader back into the woman's childhood, where it all began. This book allows the reader to feel and experience what she went through. I want to thank the author for finally making sense of something that is a mystery to many."
3,great book but seems predictable towards the end,No spoilers here but when the old villian is reintroduced toward the end of the book you can kind of guess what is going to happen.
4,Shocked that I enjoyed this book!,I don't read romance novels very often but somehow came upon this book and I had a hard time putting it down...some of the story line was predicable but I still enjoyed it from beginning to end. Erienne was a tad annoying but I like the Christopher character..kind of a cross between Phantom of the Opera and John Wayne!!! I felt Kathleen Woodiweiss writings of the heart skipping a beat whenever Erienne and Christopher came into contact was spot on....anyone who's ever been in love knows that feeling when your heart feels like its fallen to your knees and you feel like everyone can tell!!! A sweet love story and I enjoyed it very much.
5,Number one book in my eyes!!,"I first read this book when I was 16 years old, My mom gave it to me and have read it over again every year since, I am now 40 and it is still my most favorite book I still have the big paper back version of it and plan to keep it even though I have it on my kindle too. I love all of Kathleens books and probably have most of them. I would love a sequel to this book, I would be the first one to buy it. Thumbs up to Kathleen GREAT WRITING!!!"
5,The most enticing romance EVER!!,This was the first Woodiwiss book I ever read and I still read it over and over again. The story never gets old! The characters bring the story to life and Woodiwiss does a fantastic job in describing everything in wonderful detail!! I have read all of her works and recommend them all!!
2,My first Woodwiss and LAST,"I think I'm being very generous with two stars this book has had me cursing since the first chapter. I am on page 238 and I refuse to continue, since I already know the ending as if you can't figure it out from the moment Christopher asks Ben about it. Erienne is a BIATCH!!! I hate her so much she's a shallow vapid flouzy (sp?). I wish sometimes that someone accidently shot her and the book would have an abrut ending. First clue she's stupid...she can't figure out who her husband is...REALLY? I mean cause there aren't enough clue just jumping out at you. And her fear of his deformity ugh I could kill her. She dumb simple as that don't waste your time."
4,Woodiwiss hits home again!,"Northern England in the late 1700's -- a time of Lords... taverns... grand balls... and family honor. Experience the ever-churning emotions of Erienne Fleming as she learns to love the handsome and charming Yankee captain, Christopher Seton.</P>Excellent... heart-warming... you won't want to miss this one!"
4,Not bad for the price,"100% cotton, decent design. Good shirt for the money paid. No need to add anything else - the product says it all."
4,match the description,"Got them just the way I was expected after reading the description, although the negative reviews gave me some nervous feelings. I preferred a bit snuggler fit since I will be wearing them as an undershirt or for a hot summer day. The collar is a bit small, thus may show under some T-shirts if you plan to ""layer."" Have not wash them yet so I will post any changes to the shape/size. Overall, comfortable and soft, a bit thin but that is perfect for layering."
4,Great Shirts,The transaction was very easy. These shirts are great quaility and very comfortable. I would highly recommend.
5,For Students And Their Teachers,This book is a wonderful foundation for basic technical analysis. Students of the subject should have this book in their library. Ralph Acampora covers it all. I've already signed up for his next class.
1,You'll be better off going to a palm reader,"The premise behind Acampora's theory is simple: There were a couple of other bull markets which sort of looked like the current one (if in fact it hasn't already ended). This should have been a 4-page research report, not a book. This really was more of a brochure."
2,Some Interesting Thoughts But Nothing Revolutionary,"Since you can buy this book pretty cheaply now, it is probably worth reading. Every book has a couple of ideas in it that are interesting to think about and Mr. Acampora has enough experience in the market to offer some different perspectives. But, you are probably not going to learn much that will directly impact your ability to profit in the market."
