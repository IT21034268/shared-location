2,"Why, Tony? Why?","Every year there has to be a game adapted from a classic movie or based on a classic movie (From Russia With Love, which is actually not a bad game.). Recentlty just landing my hands on a copy of this, I simply couldn't resist picking up SCARFACE: THE WORLD IS YOURS. I loved the movie SCAR FACE, and I was gonna love this.But It turns out I didn't.The controls are really a joke, instead of your normal FPS/3PS/RPG etcetera, there are really bland controls you can't even tell what to do. The dialouge is corny, and everything else is a joke.For die-hard fans only, I guess."
5,KUHN RIKON 7-LITER STAINLESS PRESSURE COOKER,"I HAVE USED THIS PRODUCT SEVERAL TIMES, AND SO FAR IT HAS PERFORMEDABSOLUTELY GREAT. IN THE FUTURE IF I NEEDED TOP QUALITY PRESSURE COOKEROF ANY SIZE OFFERED BY THIS COMPANY I WOULD PURCHASE THIS BRAND."
1,TERRIBLE OPTION,"Just got this product and inserted an SD card to view the pictures taken with my NIKON D80 camera taken on RAW format. Surprise!!! The small LCD Screen on my camera has better resolution than the much bigger Screen on the Picture Porter.If you want a product to store and better view your work while on the field, then this is NOT what you are looking for. Images look blurry at best, 0 detail and 0 sharpness...LCD Resolution on this prod is 320x240, and the worst is that no information on resolution is available here for similar products.... SKIP!!!"
5,A simple and effective way to learn basic endgame technique,"One of the basic advices is that you should study tactical puzzles repeatedly to improve in chess. I wonder way this advice is not given for other parts in chess, for instance endgame. Hall's ""Endgame Challenge!"" consists of 451 endgame puzzles. My belief is that by going through these puzzles over and over again, will dramatically improve your endgame understanding. You can buy yourselves an endgame reference book, like Muller and Lambrecht's ""Fundamental Chess Endings"", but in addition buy Halls puzzle book. When you have reached a rating over 1800, you can start to study ""Fundamental Chess Endings more deeply. Until then, use it only as a reference in addition to Hall's ""Endgame Challenge!""."
5,GPB Shampoo - Glycogen Protein Balance,"Really like GPB Shampoo. I have my hair permed and tinted so I am careful about the shampoo I use.GPB Shampoo works great. My hair is clean, manageable and shiny . What I do not like isthe color (brownish color) and scent (cannot describe the scent). However, I will continue using this shampoo.Aubrey Organics GBP Glycogen Protein Balancing Shampoo -- 11 fl oz"
5,Love Foucalt,"Bought this book for a class but it is a must read in my opinion for anyone interested in Gender and Sexuality, and isn't that all of us?"
4,Foucault's argument against repression theory,The history of Sexuality is a great piece of work from Foucault. It documents the history of sexuality and argues against the repression theory of sexuality. It demonstrates Foucault's pursuit of Truth and Power relations and even offers a few hints at action (Really more in The History of Sexuality II).
1,The Worst Book I've Ever Read,"No character development, boring, cliche plot. Very implausible characters. This was completely unrealistic and very disappointing on so many levels. Don't waste your money."
5,The best DCD-CD (of their many masterpieces),"This is my favorite CD of all time. The overused word ""haunting"" doesn't even do it justice. ""Anywhere out of the World"" is DCD's best song (or best lyric anyway). ""Dawn of the Iconoclast"" would have to be in a tie with the Intro to Carmina Burana as the most dramatic piece of music in history. This is soul-stirring and awe-inspiring. This is the soundtrack to passion itself!"
2,Dragonsong is imaginative and a complex story,"The imaginative and sometimes complex story of Dragonsong is an involvong read. Dragonsong was a complex book in which the author introduced foreign and new fictional concepts. The entire story of Menolly is derived from the ongoing drama of a fictional land called Pern. The story is complex because it explains a twisted tale of a moon that sends deadly bacteria to Pern. The story goes on to describe how the dragon lizards were formed and why. The complexity continues with the ancient art of being a harpist, which is a singer of ancient story-songs that describe ancient times. The novel Dragonsong although imaginative was over all a complex and foreign story. I personally found it hard to believe and understand at all levels. Unless a person is intrigued by fantasy and the magic I would not recommend this book."
2,"might appeal to younger readers, but mostly unoriginal and dull","Menolly's dream is to be a singer and songwriter, but her Hold (and in particular her leader, and incidentally, father) forbids girls from so much as humming music. When Menolly is injured, it seems as though music is forever forbidden to her. Frustrated by her cruel and neglectful family, Menolly runs away from home. In a cave, she helps a fire lizard hatch her babies. Menolly is imprinted on the nine babies and teaches them to sing. A simple young adult tale that many young adolescent readers will enjoy and identify with, though the lack of deep characters, the slow pace and predictability, the unoriginality in the face of other superior novels of the genre, may hinder some enjoyment. Grade: C"
2,"Dragonsong was an imaginative, but yet complex book.","I don't enjoy reading fiction books because there is no base of reality and its all imaginative, like the story of Dragonsong written by Anne McCaffrey. It is an imaginative but yet complex book about dragons and fire lizards. The thought of dragons killing thread and protecting the world from harm. People had to impress the dragons and fire lizards by feeding them and talking to them. After that the person would be connected to that certain animal for life. The dragon or lizard impressed could actually read the mind of their owner and would follow them everywhere the person went. When dragons go ""between"" it gives a totally new view on our lives, it gives you a lot to think about and really starts your imagination. I personally didn't enjoy reading Dragonsong. To me it was very confusing, and boring. But for the people who like fanatasies, this would be an excellent book to read."
3,"A promising story, with certain problems","The story line had promise, one of the best I had ever read. But, the story had very annoying flaws. One was the fact that the book was too short and went too few places. Second was the fact that the Fire Lizards did nothing. Other then these, the book was an excellent fantasy piece."
3,The book Dragonsong is a confusing story.,"Dragonsong is a confusing story telling of many people. It was confusing when Menolly named all her fire lizards, because trying to remember which one was which was hard. Also the book was confusing when they told the story of Brekke and what happened to her. Another example was trying to understand how important impressing a fire lizard was for Brekke. It was confusing at first but then it became a little more clear near the end.I think the book Dragonsong teaches about life. How unfair it can be, yet how enjoyable it can be. I think I look at life a little different now since reading the book. But I would only recommend it if you have lots of patience to try and understand it. Also if you really enjoy fiction."
2,Disappointing,"I expect more songs, but got many that I have heard before on this short CD. Buy one of her other excellent CDs' before this one."
2,Like a newbie,"Not up to her usual standards. Barely got through it. Usually buy without seeing reviews. Love her other works a lot. Seems like a first novel, a poor first novel. Don't waste your money or if you must buy it used."
4,From a Koga Kunoichi,"As a woman who has trained as a Koga ninja, I highly recommend this book. It was referred to me by my jonin, and is a great tool for learning about some of the techniques the Koga ninja used/use. I wish this book was larger, rather than a pretty thin paperback, but the information it does have is very valuable to anyone wanting a starter in learning ninjitsu, or anyone just wanting to learn about the Koga ninja."
3,Silly Rich People Who Don't Even Know How to Fry an Egg,"I do understand why earlier reviewers here liked this book. But I must confess that the artificiality of the main characters -- they are rich, idle, silly, useless nincompoops -- turned me off. I had heard of Mary Roberts Rinehart all my life and recalled my mother reading her later novels. But I had never read anything by her, even though I knew she was a pioneer American mystery writer. It was the setting of this novel that irritated me and maybe I'll give Rinehart a try again in the future. And I will admit that this locked-room mystery (or, rather, locked-house [because of a smallpox quarantine]) is fairly neatly plotted. Hence three stars rather than the one-star I would have given it if it hadn't been for the plot."
4,Fan e-mail...,"I was going to hear MxPx and Fanmail and Shades Apart were opening for them. I was pleasantly surprised to enjoy the entire concert, beginning to end, song for song, every single band. These songs are smartly written and excellently executed. My favorites being Rock & Roll Star (which they appropriately opened the show with) and the Police remake of Every Breath You Take. I've heard many versions of this song, never coming close to the original, but somehow a punk twist is what the song truly needed. It reminded me of the Shades Apart version of Tainted Love awhile back and how good that one was. I'm saving my 5 star review for when Fanmail releases their full length release!"
5,Amazing,I love to listen to this soundtrack as I work on my art. The MirrorMask movie is one of my favorite and having the beautiful music on a CD is awesome. It is has a wonderful jazz sound that has a calming and eerie mood to it. I love it so much.
4,Great soundtrack for a great film,Music can really make a movie and the soundtrack to this movie really adds to the overall feel. Great atmospheric music.
4,Mirrimask - the music,"After seeing the movie, I had to get the music. It was not disappointing. The songs are mythical, the arrangements and instrumentation are excellent. Only drawback is the ""soundtrack"" characteristic of short snipits of songs that work better in the movie than by themselves."
5,THIS IS A EXCELLENT MOVIE,"This is the best movie I've seen yet. I heard thru the grapevine that they are making another Rugrats movie, they are beginning to make it now and I can't wait for that to come out too. I think this new one will be just as great as this one was. My favorate characters are Phil & Lil, I also like Tommy, Chuckie, Angellica & Dil."
3,My Review,"I'm Not Sure If This Movie Is Good Or Not But I Have Watched The Rugrats When I Was A Toddler And In The Middle Of My Preschool Class But I had A Ad For This Movie On One Of My Old Blue's Clues VHS Tapes But I Never Got It But I Read Some Reviews That Said ""It's Pretty Boring"" But I'm Not Sure But I Gave It 3 Stars Since I Also Heard It's Pretty Good So The Only Reason Why I Had To Choose 3 Stars Because I Had To Choose Something But Overall I Heard It's Pretty Good But I'm Not Sure"
1,The one of the worst movies of al time!,I think The Rugrat's Movie is very stupid! I can't stand Baby Dill! I thin Tommy should have let Baby Dill drown or let him get eaten by the monkeys! And The Reptar Wagon was even more stupid than Baby Dill. My advice to you is don't buy the movie! You'll regret it!
3,Disappointed Rugrats Fan!,"Rugrats is one of my favorite cartoons and I thought I would love this movie but I didn't and was disappointed, I didn't find it entertaining at all and was really bored, I have seen much better episodes of Rugrats on Nickelodeon and I thought that a Rugrats movie I saw on Nickelodeon called All Growed Up was much better too!"
1,Overrated movie is overrated,"When growing up with Rugrats, the second movie was my favorite. Why? Simple. This movie has too many songs (usually parodies), too much childish humor, and to top it all off, Susie is in it!"
5,1/2 inch Rope Ratchet,"Haven't had a chance to use the 1/2 inch Rope Ratchet yet... I have a 3/8"" one that works beautifully, so have no reason to expect less from the 1/2"" model! Received my order in a timely manner from the vendor.Would not hesitate to recommend this product to ANYONE who has trouble working those web and ratchet things! Its simple and straight-forward to use."
3,"Cute, but...","This is cute, but not that well made. Much harder to get the pieces in compared to most Potato Head products. Plus the parts don't work on standard Potato Heads - they aren't the same size for the holes.Great for display, not great for play."
1,Cheap Plastic Side Bar,"I was thrilled when I found this copyholder, because I've been looking for one with the side slider for a long time. But what a disappointment when it arrived. The main problem is that while the copyholder itself is of a sturdy metal, but sidebar which slides up and down comes as an attachment with a glue deal that's supposed to hold it in place. I just don't see how it would last very long. I returned it."
3,Where's the Beef?,"Oh my. Where is that awesome song that they play in Super Bowl III, when Unitas takes over in the 4th quarter and drives the Colts to their only TD. Or where is ""Doomsday in the Dome"" for crying out loud, that somber, American-Indian type song played in many NFL Films shows, but most memorable in Super Bowl XII when Dallas spanks the Broncos. Or better yet that song in Super Bowl VII that they play when Kilmer rallied the troops and drives the skins down the field. Man, you think they could have gotten all of those favorites fit in on 10 freeking CD's. Whoever produced this didn't do their homework. There are some good ones in this set don't get me wrong, but it is missing a ton of those songs that still make the hair stand up on my arms. I am VERY disappointed!"
3,GOOD HARDCORE !,"This is a weird hybrid between early american HC influences (Circle Jerks come to mind) and typical UK 82 style massive singalong choruses and tribal drumming.The result is harsh,fast and heavy;recording is very good resulting in a very pleasant listening (if not musical) experience.Outstanding drumming job.Does not get metally at the end as other reviewer stated but the last 4 tracks are a melodic oriented rock'n roll ep that's a shock to listen to after 21 tracks of blistering sonic mayhem.47 'that include their entire discography,singles and a complete lp;most of the early songs are short 1 min. bursts of energy.I can perfectly live without this cd but now I've coughed up the cash I don't regret it either.FOR CURIOUS PUNK ROCK HISTORIANS AND COLLECTORS ONLY !"
5,Maybe better luck this time,"I first purchased this item in 2007 at my local Walgreen store for $20. Since then, this FM transmitter went through goods and bads of my life with me for 5 years. Of course, I had to change the cable twice, but the durability and longevity of this item were just amazing. During summer of 2011, I noticed that I only get sound on one side, and only at certain configuration, I would get sound on both sides of the speaker. Then beginning of this year, my FM transmitter finally died. So I bought my second one through Amazon, but this time I wasn't so lucky because it died after one month. I tried to change the fuse, but it didn't work. Now, I just bought my third one, and maybe this time I would get lucky. The sound quality is decent, and it doesn't have any cool features, but it does the job."
3,Pleasure-Greatest Hits,"Glide is on here way too many times. Best hits is a better choice. The song ""Living Without You "", is on The ""Special Things"", album. It has a solid red album jacket with ""Pleasure"" written in cursive across the front of it. I do not believe it is available on cd. Pleasure is surely one of the best bands of it's era."
5,Works for FSA Mega Exo BBs,Used this to replace my crappy FSA Mega Exo with a Shimano Dura Ace. Worked like a charm.
5,excellent but beware..,"I can only comment on 1 video bucause this was all i got when i received the package ( there is supossed to be 8 videos and a book) i asked for a replacement wich i got and received again only 1 video then i asked for a refund wich i am still waiting.The only video i watch was excellent, clear images and a very important thing, the author explains things in a way that you do not only understand the image but you also understand why it looks that way.So i recomend that you buyit but be sure you get the all material and not just a part of it."
2,"SALAD ""LEAKER""",THIS SALAD SPINNER IS TRULY WORTHLESS..I THOUGHT THAT THIS WAS AN ENCLOSED BOWL..LITTLE TO MY KNOWLEDGE DID I KNOW THERE WAS GOING TO BE WHOLES ON THE BOTTOM OF THE BOWL..I AM TRYING TO FIGURE WHATS THE SENSE IN HAVING A SPOUT TO POUR OFF YOU WATER WHEN THERE IS A BUNCH OF HOLES INTHE BOTTOM..IT MAKES A MESS IN THE FRIDG IF YOU DONT COMPLETELY SPIN OFF ALL THE WATER. IF YOU BUY THIS BOWL YOUR GOING TO HAVE TO PUT SOMETHING UNDER NEATH IT WHEN YOU PUT IT IN THE FRIDG I THOUGHT I HAD KNOCKED SOMETHING OVER BECAUSE THE WATER THATS LEFT AFTER YOU SPIN JUST DRAINS OUT THE BOTTOM.. YOU CAN'T REALLY SEE THAT WHEN YOUR ORDERING IT..BUT HEY WHAT CAN YOU EXPECT FOR 6.99 THE SHIPPING COST ALMOST AS MUCH AS THE BOWL ITSELF.
4,A great salad spinner,"I bought this to use as a simple honey extractor for when I start harvesting honey from my beehive. So in the meantime, I've been using it for its intended purpose and I am amazed at how well it works in spite of the simple design. I highly recommend this product even though it was made in China. I just wish there is an equivalent one made in the USA."
2,Genius?:,"Grown men singing about ghosts, devils, souls, gods, and angels. When they move onto reality they sing about rain, not just rain, but spring rain from the Liberty Belle release, easy to see the genius here. Seriously when you buy an album and put it on you can tell what your going to get with them. It will be solid and formulaic. Unfortunately the items I have bought from the Go-Betweens have never lived up to the promise of the reviews I have read. The songs remain precious and dull. This is their best offering, but still it is bland and it does bother me when a band is ignorant and conforms to the worldview shared by the masses. They continue to do this and remain a band that delivers generic, dull songs AND although this album is their best at capturing their formula it is not entertaining. Pretentious."
4,-,"The game was pretty fun, better than the shoot-them-up type of games. However this is not a deaf or hard-of-hearing friendly game. I was able to muddle through most of the puzzles by luck, intution, and help from the clue book. I would have enjoyed it more if the dialougue and the hints would have been written down on the screen. But so far I am enjoying it"
3,"Great when it was released, but now...","When The 7th Guest was first released in 1993, it was pretty much just a CD-ROM showcase: ""Look what I can do."" Further technological advancements, though, haven't proven kind to The 7th Guest, but the game remains as good now as it ever was. It's mostly an series of puzzles and brain teasers with only the barest thread of a story (and not always a clear, sensible one, at that) to connect them. Some of the puzzles, however, are pretty good, and the game has a wonderful, creepy style that infects every puzzle with an energy that definitely sets The 7th Guest apart from most other puzzle games. If you know what you're getting yourself into, there's no reason you can't enjoy The 7th Guest today."
3,Good product...not versatile.,"This is a good product, but not very versatile. It cannot be used on the stove or it will scratch your pans, so only use in a bowl. For a universal whisk, purchase one that is coated so it doesn't scratch your pans."
2,"When I first got it, the seal was ...","When I first got it, the seal was leaking and therefore I was overpowered with the smell (it was very strong), which I initially didn't like at all. I waited a few days and tried it again, but I didn't care for this scent as much as others. It was okay, but not something I'd chose over other items."
5,Love thse soursebooks,What can I say? ASTD sourcebooks are a great resource to have on your leadership bookshelf. This book is a must buy for any HR or corporate trainer.Actually all of the ASTD sourcebooks are a must buy.
3,"Good quality brake, but need some work to put it on","I bought the brake to put onto the front wheel of a 16-inch bike for my kid. The brake is in good quality. But it takes me quite a while to put it on. First, you have to use WD-40 to take the grip off. In the process of twisting the grip with tool, be careful not to destroy the plastic like I almost did. Then you have to cut the wire and the casing. The casing is quite strong and not easy to cut. Then you have to take the brake apart and replace the axle (1.5 inch is too short) with the other axle with 2 inch length to mount. Be warned that the front screw is very tight. I managed to put it on the bike after putting it off several weeks. The seller's support is useful. But it is not as easy as I thought."
5,BMX Brakes,"Good Quality Alloy parts. Brake pad material too soft and mushy. An easy replacement, but requires a trip to the bike shop, which defeats the whole purpose of buying brakes online. Overall, good stuff. Easy to order. Fast delivery."
5,Excellent simple brake set,"Keep in mind this is a low cost brake. I was surprised how much came for the price. There were two sets of mounting bolts for different size uses and even different sculpted washers for front or back mounting. The calipers clear a 2.125 knobby tire and a fender, so they worked for what I wanted to use them for. I am not expecting them to perform like expensive brake sets, but they work fine to repair a simple bike for normal street use. The set includes ferules and cable cap to make the cut ends of the cable and cable housing neat."
4,It brakes,"For about $12 you can't beat it. I installed this on a beach cruiser with coaster brakes to provide a little more stopping. Works well. Installation was easy but an instruction sheet would have been handy. A couple of Youtube ""How To"" videos later and I was good to go."
3,"Not great, but doable.","The product is generally fine for the price, but the cable is very long. Unless you're prepared (and know how) to cut bike brake cable in the event that it's too long, pay the extra $10 or $20 and have a bike shop put a brake on. If you can cut and fit a cable, it will be fine. The actual pads and lever are adequate...not great...adequate."
4,Fun but noisy,---My 5yo son absolutely loves thhis tank!!!! It's a great size to go along with the smaller GI Joe action figures.
2,Riddled with Errors,"The available features are very handy, and the program allows you to zoom in and out which is helpful for those of us not blessed with 20/20 vision. Navigation is simple and intuitive. Overall, the program is pretty much what you'd expect in a crossword puzzle.The most disturbing problem is the extraordinary number of typos present! Many times, two letters are transposed in the puzzle and you will be told that your answers are incorrect; to have the program count your efforts as a ""success,"" you must know the _REAL_ answer and then play around with the letters to make it match the program's _incorrect_ answer. I was quite disappointed by this particular flaw. While I have experienced the same problem with other crossword software titles, I had hoped that a product associated with the New York Times would have placed a higher priority on accuracy. It's disheartening to see such a fine paper lend their name to a clearly inferior product."
4,No surprises but solid content. Recommended for classrooms,"What you see is what you get with this book,and that's plenty. It's a great aid to teaching science,because it helps students more easily and quickly visualize when and where and to a small degree, how various scientific discoveries were made.What I like most about it is that the book doesn't make the assumption that science existed only in the West. Discoveries in the East,Middle East and even the Americas are mapped in ""Timetables"". To be honest I wouldn't have bought this one for private use but it's invaluable in a classroom setting."
3,"Good shot, but has problems","While the story is interesting, especially if you have played the 7th guest previously, there are problems. About mid-way through the game I was interupted during a key video scene and my computer hung up. The company is no help in trying to find the problem and so I have never quite finished the game. So like other reviewers have indicated: stick to the 7th Guest if it's horror and scares your after. This one gives horrors of a diffrent kind. :)"
1,There are better books out there,"I was excited to get this book because I do believe names have their own meaning. Unfortunately, this book gives no in-depth explanation of any basis associated with names but rather assures the reader that the author has studied names for over 50 years and knows what he's talking about. The beginning of the book attempts to explain some things but only a paragraph or so is offered for each topic, certainly no real in-depth information. The whole book was terribly disappointing and the numerous typos are surprising - someone did not proof this book.I highly recommend ""The Hidden Truth of Your Name - The Nomenology Project"" over this book. Fewer names are included but the principles are explained so much better. I also feel the attributes for each name are much more accurate than the ones in ""The Secret Meaning of Names"". The secret is to start with the right book first and to learn why there is meaning to names."
5,EXCELLENT INSTRUMENTAL SOUNDTRACK!!,"This is a wonderful soundtrack. Very beautiful instrumental music,great to listen to both in the car or at home. Highly recommend this CD even if you are not a Blood + fan!"
4,"Strong, masculine scent but a little to oily.","I bought this product from a store and I thought it smelled really good, it was much more spicy than any other fragrance that I have ever had. Everybody in my family liked it really well except the 2 people that opinions mattered the most. These 2 women are the ones I trust to pick out clothes for me when I go shopping...they know what looks good on me and what does not. One of these ladies is my fiance and the other is my sister.Some people will really like the fragrance but my biggest problem is that it is a little too oily for me. It is not oily right after I put it on but about 2 hours after applying the product, it feels like someone has rubbed vegetable oil all over my face (well not quite that bad, it is just more oily than I like it too be). I don't think I am using too much because I use just enough wipe all over my face and neck.Overall, it is pretty good stuff with a hearty scent."
2,Std bases for 770,"These mounts are a great design. My only issue is that the screws provided where two different lengths. I measured the thread depth on the rifle (4 locations) and they are identical. if I were to use the short screws provided, I would of allowed one of the two bases to be fastened with at most three threads while the longer screws give 5-6 threads. Not a big deal, cost me 1 dollar at the local gunsmith..."
1,the hardest can opener,"I'm sure that this is a wonderful can opener if you can figure out how to use it. I recieved mine as a gift, and neither the giver, myself, or my husband can figure out how to use the thing. I was told that the instructions could be copied from the internet, but who can find them?"
5,takes a little practice to get used to ...,"... but i'll never go back to the standard openers. perhaps this is paranoia on my part, but i find it unsanitary and unsafe when the top of a freshly opened can falls into the contents. how do i know what dirty paws have been in contact with that can? and have you ever tried to fish out that top without cutting your fingers? this one cuts cleanly along the side, so you get no jagged edges. i've had mine for 2 years and have yet to find a can it couldn't open (ok, i'll admit i haven't tried rectangular sardine cans). another advantage is that you can re-use the top to cover the can if you are using only part of the contents."
2,Sit and Spin,"I bought this about a year ago and used it for 6 months. I was thrilled at the ""idea"" of it when I got it. Thinking how safe this is when recycling. And yes it is wonderful for that! However, after a couple of months, the gears must have stripped and the can-opener was worthless. It would not open a can. Also it is very hard to turn. Small cans are fairly effortless. But when you are trying to open up a 3 pound coffee can first thing in the morning, your hand gets TIRED! If you have any problems with arthritis, carpal tunnel or tendinitus, this can opener is not for you.This can-opener is a great idea, but there has to be an better way."
1,BUY ANYTHING ELSE,"AS A VOLUNTEER FIREFIGHTER WHO LIKES COMPUTER GAMES, THIS WAS A TRAGIC DISAPPOINTMENT IN EVERY SENSE OF THE GAME, FROM BAD GRAPHICS TO LACK OF REALISM AND CHALLENGE. PURE JUNK I HOPE THEY CAN COME OUT WITH SOMETHING BETTER FITTING OF OUR NATIONS FIREFIGHTERS."
1,Close...........But NOT the Real thing!!,"I am the wife of a firefighter & started basic training myself. This game can let you ""pretend"" to be a firefighter, but in reality, this game doesn't come close!! It does show what it is like to ""be in a fire"" & ""fight a fire"", but it is way to easy!! Our 12 year old son beat all 3 levels within a matter of hours. (He could master this game w/ no idea of what fighting a real fire is like.) If you want an ""idea"" of being a ""true American hero"" is like, go for it. As for the firefighters out there........don't waste your money on it for the ""adrenaline"" rush! It isn't worth it!"
2,Not a good introduction to Russian music,"This CD is an okay compilation of songs and instrumentals with half recorded in a studio and half recorded live. Two stars were taken off for the bad sound quality of some of the live cuts. The balance of the instruments is so bad on these tracks that they are almost unlistenable.A third star was taken off because no information is given about who the performers are, or about the music itself."
1,Be careful if you buy this CD.,"The music is great!! Is the very best of Erasure. However, the problem is the CD itself. It plays great in a CD player, but transfered to a copy CD or MP3/iTunes it is full of skips. When I contacted iTunes about this, they said that it may be have been intentional so as to stem unauthorized copying, eventhough I paid for the original. Wave of the future??Thought I'd warn the unsuspecting."
5,Wonderful writing! But would someone please tell me...,Did I miss something? What did the parrot say? Help! You can comment to me directly.
4,Pretty Insightful,"This book is a pretty good account of Miles Davis' life and music. For the most part most of the information about Miles' life has been covered in other books, and is covered especially well in his own autobiography. The author of this book does know a lot about the music of Miles Davis, which takes center stage in his musical analysis of each album. The appendixes of this book are very well done, I especially enjoy the appendix that has highly detailed information on each album that Miles has played on. For musicians there is an appendix which gives examples in musical notation of Miles Davis' solos. Another element that helps this book is the vast amount of quotes from people that knew Miles personally such as his musicians and friends. All in all, this biography gives a good account of Miles' life and is a great source for information on his music. Read Miles Davis' own autobiography first, then pick up this book."
4,Awesome,"This is the best biography on Davis. Carr does a great job of covering both his life and his music in prose that is detailed, but not unreadable. I wish there had been an even great discussion of his music, but I'd argue that such an approach would have left less more for information on his personal relationships and life. I wish I'd have had time to listen to all his albums while reading this."
5,Not fair to fish,This is a top quality device. It is installed on my pontoon boat. The foot pedal is ergonomically laid out and you will learn how to use it and get comfortable with it quickly. I was surprised that the motor has no reverse. You have to turn the motor 180 degrees but it is so responsive that you will quickly get comfortable with this as well. The motor is so quiet and near vibration free that I sometimes can't tell if the prop is turning. It does not have an indicator light to tell you that the prop is spinning. This would have been nice to have but should not be taken as a criticism. The battery level indicator on the motor base is very handy.
4,Been searching,"I remember owning this album (yes, vinyl) when I was younger. I remembered the song Fun Time and the album cover distinctly, but could not find the CD anywhere. Mr. Cocker's voice is so unique and almost iconic. He makes everything he sings come to life. Each song on the CD is Luxurious as Joe adds his style and sound to make them his own."
3,A Brighter Shade Of Pale,This is worth it's price only because of the best version of A whiter shade of pale I've ever heard! Cocker is probably one of the best singers in his genre. Hurry up and get the Stingray album if you haven't got it. It getting more expensive on the used-market all the time. It's Cocker's best album!
5,A MUST READ !!!,"it is not a standard text, not meant to be. but it is a very practical review with practical information and applications not found in many standard texts. the information is also pretty current and accurate, albeit paltry. definitely a good read the month before the exam, and the best review material for those finished with the exams. a nice fresh approach to a tedious task all in all. good one!"
3,Red Baron,"The flying sequences are excellent. The story is remarkably inane. The true life of Manfred von Richtofen is interesting, I don't know why they invented such a ridiculous background story for this movie. The flying sequences are worth sitting through the rest of the dreck."
5,"It's Entertainment, Not A History Lesson","Simply stated: If an entertaining aviation flick--without the customary fleshy sex scenes and gratuitous four-letter expletives (yawn, yawn)--is what you're looking for, then look no further. If it's historical enlightenment that you seek, then look elsewhere. My one gripe is that the only subtitles are in French."
5,Smells really wonderful!!,These candles are the best!! Long lasting and have great smelling scents! I use them in both my kitchen and powder room and they make the entire house smell wonderful!
3,"Stylish, but thin leather","This is a beautiful dress shoe, but the leather seems thin. It chaffed in the back almost immediately. The sole seems a bit too thin, too. However, it is very elegant."
4,The storyline and facts are dead on,"Even though I knew alot of the facts of this case and was very involved with the first trial of Steven Bonilla and William Nichols Ann Rule kept me glued to the book with her consise and accurate knowledge of the case. She also did a wonderful job of putting a very personal face on all the people involved, good and bad"
2,Out of touch with the 1990's,Though it is true that most selling decisions are emotional. This book misses the point that many or maybe even most people do not like a salesman digging into their emotional shorts. Some of these ideas in the book were personally tried by me and the techniques fell flat. The people of the '90's are better educated and don't want to get hoodwinked by someone playing the obvious emotional games
2,Granny Dan by Danielle Steel,I was pretty disappointed as I struggled to maintain interest! This has got to be one of Steel's most uninteresting novel's I have read. The end had a rather unique twist though predictable leading up to the end!
1,Sick too Many Times,"I think one should describe this book as how to survive the maladies of the early 20th century. My gosh, how many times does this woman have to succumb to complete exhaustion and be able to take only bits of nourishment. And sorry, Nickolai, you are a complete loser. You married Marie....make the best of it. Obviously I didn't like the book! I don't like these unrealistic episodes of complete romance conquering all...my fault. I am sure Steel satiates the longings of many a reader, just too soapy for me."
2,A disappointment,"I was really disappointed afer reading this book, it sounded so good reading the dust cover. I found this story of Danina and her lover Nikoli lacking in many areas. First this novel starts out with Danina's Grandaughter discovering letters of her recently departed Grandmother. The book then begins telling Danina's story, although a letter format is not used here. Also this story is lacking a lot of historical detailing that would have given more substance to the storyline. Finally there are too many personal details missing here. I found it really hard to want these people to be together, there was no chemistry between them. The book abruptly stops and leaves out details about what happens to Danina after arriving in the United States. I personally wondered why Danina's daughter was descibed in the manner she was. This book would have been great if it had been about 300 pages longer."
3,Very entertaining,"I thought this was a very good book. I've been a little disappointed with some of her books (ie., The Clone - which I thought was written to meet a publication deadline). D. Steele is a great writer and I wish she would spend more time telling the story and giving a little more history but I guess we can't have everything. I thought it was a very good story ..............."
4,Good fluff reading.,"I enjoyed reading this little book and finished it in one day, although I had no intention of doing so when I started. It is good summer reading and sounded like it could have been true. Has anyone else heard that D. Steel is not writing her own books, and has otherswriting and then they go under Danielle Steel as author? Some of her latest books seem to be that way. Let's give credit where it is due!"
2,Disappointed....again.,"Again, I find myself disappointed with a Danielle Steele book. Is she rushing to complete too many books in a year, or has she lost her magic touch? I have read all her books, but definitely think her earlier books were by far her best. I have not purchased a D. S. book since ""The Ranch"", so great was my disappointment in that one. Instead, I trade with friends or go to the local library. Please, to whom it may concern, have Ms. Steele go back and reread her earlier books. Maybe she can recapture her art of storytelling without having to repeat herself throughout the book. Then I will purchase another."
2,"A less likeable version of ""Zoya""","In keeping with her tendency to cover familiar territory, DS has gone back to the Russian Revolution with ""Granny Dan"", a book that leaves you wondering ... well, why? First, the whole concept of ""Granny Dan"" -- the beloved grandmother who has died at the beginning of the book having all this secret back history -- is absurd. And as she has done before, by starting the novel by telling you how it's going to end up, DS manages to completely remove any chance at intrigue. I don't have any problem with Ms. Steel covering historical events in her novels -- for example, I love her ""Titanic"" depiction in ""No Greater Love"" -- but I do get increasingly irritated with her characters being relatives of the Romanov family or other such royalty. How about writing about a completely unknown, totally unconnected person who lived during the Revolution? That might show some real insight into the struggle -- and I'm sure you could get a love story in there too."
4,Good for better players,"This review is just a warning to beginning players: don't expect this book to help you. It's just a long list of openings and variations, ending with the symbols = or +/= or =/+. (Here's a tip. The initial position would be +/=. This book isn't much more useful than that to anyone rated less than 1500.) If you don't know how to evaluate positions, how to take advantage of imbalances, etc., this book will not help you at all. More general books about opening and middle-game strategy will help most people much more than this book.As far as the typos, it's not too bad. There are a few, but I've always been able to figure out what was meant easily and quickly."
2,recent update,"I was disappointed with this book; I ordered it online without realizing that it was a recent publication, illustrated 'in the style of' H.A. Rey. Both the illustrations and the stories lack the charm of the originals."
2,Not for a Kindle or iPad!!!,"While these stories are classic George and what you expect, the kindle format is anything but readable. The book is basically scanned and re-subtitled under the illustrations. It does not work well at all on my reader and is a waste of money. It is absolutely frustrating to try and read this in a dim room at night time, I'll stick to Thomas the Train books, they seemed to be actually made for an e-reader. Until I see a review that states these are improved for the e-book format I'll pass."
3,Interesting but conventional,"The lead vocals here are very creative and emotional, esp alanis whose somewhat wild voice soars over the music. But be forewarned that the background music is fairly conventional western orchestral motifs and the background vocals brought back horrid memories of sunday church choir for me. I was hoping for more of a mixed cultural and mystical influence."
2,A trite and immature composition beautifully performed,"This is a combination of the clumsy angst of Bernstein's Chichester Psalms and the mellodrama of Richard Bach (ala Jonathan Livingston Seagull). The performances are wonderful, however, and I could almost stand to listen to the whole thing before deciding to give up on it. What's next? Maybe ""Pavarotti's tribute to Neil Diamond?"""
5,Great Read!,"Great book to gain vital information about Pro-Touring cars. The must have book to keep on your work bench and beside your computer. Check out his other books too, All great stuff!"
2,Not what I expected.,This book is more concerned about what pro touring is than realy teaching you anything you can use. Looking at the cover it looks like an info rich source but it comes up way short.
4,"Great back support, but hard on bony bottoms","I loved everything about this chair at first. The lumbar support is easy to adjust and very flexible. The forward tilt is great if you hunch over a keyboard like I do. Since there's no fabric on the back, I figured it would be perfect for lounging after a run (sweat is no problem). I'd give this chair 5 stars if not for the seat. My bony bottom went to sleep after about three hours of work last night. It was very uncomfortable. I exchanged it for the Embody, which has a lot more ""give"".If you have some natural cushioning, you'll love the Mirra. If your butt is small like mine, you should look at the Embody instead."
5,Excellent and uplifting music for the spirit.,"Sam Levine music is great for the spirit and soul of people. Great to listen to while driving, surfing the Net, or working around the house. Positive and inspiring music to listen to."
3,"Good, not great.","I can appreciate Nick's lifelong experience, but as an self-described intermediate rider looking to go that extra step, I found this book MILDLY disappointing. Mostly just common sense. There were a few solid tips and guidelines but nothing revolutionary. Maybe my expectations were a bit misguided. ""Get as much seat time as possible."" ""Work on gently using the brakes and throttle."" It just seemed geared more toward a rank beginner. Discussions on traction and lean angle were informative but not enlightening. For less than 20 bucks, it's a worthwhile read. That same amount of time spent riding and improving would be just as helpful."
4,Review,"New as advertised, delivered on time. There's not much more that can be said. It was as advertised and in new condition."
3,RiceRocketeer,"I read this entire book and was not as pleased with the information it contains as I was with the two other motorcycling instructional products I purchased. I believe it has some useful information, but I would have just stuck with the Twist of the Wrist II DVD and the Proficient Motorcycling book I bought. Sorry I can't give specific details, but it's just a personal opinion about the book."
3,Fair riding guide for beginners,"This book shows basics for performance street riding always keeping security in first place. It's not for those who are looking to improve their track techniques. It's definetly not for racers, but if your're a beginner here you can find how to ride fast and in safety. You'll learn the correct body position while cornering, how to chose the best line, how to use throttle and brakes properly and especially how to make turns.Everything is explained pretty clear but i've felt the lack of some exercise to practice what's explained.I'd definetly suggest it to beginners who want to improve their knowledge about performance riding or security while on the road, but if you've already read Total Control (Lee Parks) or Twist of the Wrist I and II (Keith Code), this book won't add much more to your riding skills and knowledge."
3,Divine(?) Head,"Okay, if you've never heard of Brutal Deluxe, basically, they're a British three-piece metal band. I heard of the band due to the fact that they are constantly touring my area, and are considered one of the best new bands to come out of Britain. This, their debut album, isn't exactly groundbreaking. Opening track 'Soulmurder', despite being a crowd favourite when they play it live, is rather trad and repetitive when put to CD. This just about sums up the majority of the album, repetitive and rather dull. Instant comparisons can be made to Pantera or maybe early Korn, while the percussion and bass is rather more like Tool or even Soulfly. Highlights of this very average album are the bruising 'Full Frontal', and 'Westworld'. The rest of the album just chugs along - a bit like watching paint dry, really. To be blunt, an album for true followers only."
3,Dark Trip Hop Beat Ambient....,"This record means a lot to me as it connects with many things that were happening in my personal life when I aquired it. Artistically, this record is an indulence for the players. The focus is not clear however the result is fascinating to me. The beats are slow and it is mostly a drum and bass experiment playing to a depressed, trip hop audience. It is a mood album. Like Autechre, it can really make you uncomfortable at times. Not a wonderful record, but not really terrible if you are open to what these musicians are trying to conceptualize. If you're thinking of this as being a revolutionary record, you would be disappointed. If you are looking for something a bit off beat, check it out! Decent spin!"
3,"One average, one great - but beware of skips!","I had never heard of Zdenek Fibich, but as a devoted fan of Dvorak I figured that any late-19th century Czech composer was worth a try - especially for a low-priced cd. The first symphony here is nothing special - pleasant enough, but with nothing that grabs your attention and no very memorable melodies. (Let's be fair, though: Dvorak's first four or five symphonies are nothing too special either.) The second symphony is a treasure - especially it's vibrant last movement, which is dramatic and exciting as some of the best Dvorak.So, four stars for the music itself: but unfortunately my copy of this cd had some skips in it from the very first time I played it. That's the risk you take when you buy a bargain cd, I suppose, and perhaps it's an isolated case. But be warned. If you love Dvorak, you'll like Fibich enough that it might make more sense to go ahead and buy the two-disk, three symphony Neeme Jarvi set ...(also available here)."
2,Good Movie,You really should buy this Video. I have rented it and it is so good I'm going to buy it. Basically it is about Gourry and Lina get there statue stolen by Rezo. Who makes Zelgodess turned against Lina and Gourry. Then they find out that Shabranigdo is inside of Rezo's eyes. Buy Ok!
4,Beautifully made film,"The Technicolor is bright and vibrant. Jeanette MacDonald is beautiful in her last film and sings a little, but not as much as her musicals. However, Claude Jarman,Jr. and Lassie are the highlights of this movie. Not been seen in some time, it's a good addition to your MGM collection."
4,Great gift for the price. My 10 yr old loves it.,Great gift for the price! My 10 yr old daughter loves it.
3,Randy Stonehill,"See what Solid Rock records has to say about this release-Randy recorded this album over in England at Air Studios, in the same suite that Planet and Garden were recorded in. It has that same warm sound. It's not a gospel album but you can see the future Randy shining through and in that aspect it is a nice historical document of Randy's evolution as a person and as a creative composer.Beautifully recorded by Bill Price, who also recorded many other great English artists (including The Beatles and later America) it was produced by Jon Miller & Co.This album really gets into the heart of Randy's early days. With the same talent he still shows, this album swings from mellow to uptempo, serious to silly in the vacillating tradition you've all come to know and love.If you like Randy's other albums, you might just dig this one too.~Solid Rock Records"
2,A collection of mediocre songs,"This album is a congolmerate of a few songs by the Ataris and a foriegn band called Useless ID. It seems as though the Ataris simply dug some disposable old tunes out of the closet and just threw them on here to make a quick buck. None of the material really stands out as anything worth listening to, and fails miserably in comparison with the usually enjoyable, melodic emo/rock crafted by these guys. Addtitionally, the recording quality on each song is not up to past standards. Useless ID is a band that offers nothing that hasn't been done before, and bares an eerie similarity to almost every melodicore band, especially No Use for a Name. Their songs are forgettable at best. In the booklet, it is stressed that ""a new ataris album is coming real soon"", thus proving that this is simply FILLER. There is really no point in purchasing this album unless you are an avid Ataris or Useless ID collector/fan, because it truly is a sub-par listening experience."
2,cute but really uncomfortable,i really love the look of these shoes but cannot wear them. they are so uncomfortable across the top of my foot. they are very stiff and do not give.
1,Worst shaver i ever bought,"Product was packed well, however, plastic case for razor was open when received. Simply put, my criticism is harsh for this product, it didn't work at all for me, and my beard and mustache aren't all that thick. New blade on razor was too dull. Don't waste your money on this razor. I also bought a pack of extra razor refills for the handle, and still found the blades too dull and useless. I should have been given the option to give zero stars for this product."
2,Boring,"I didn't like the plot, the acting. I couldn't wait for the movie to be over.I found this movie to be extremely boring."
1,"Gets PIPING HOT when charging - unsafe, very unhappy","Very disappointed with this item. It doesn't hold a charge for more than 2 hours at a time. Once plugged in and charging, it gets unbelievably hot - my toddler picked it up and dropped it while hugging his hands to his body like he burned himself. I thought he must have overreacted when feeling the warmth... but then *I* picked it up and thought - wow! something is wrong here! It would have burned his sensitive skin if he happened to have been watching it when propped on his belly/knees like usual - if he had sone so while plugged in. VERY disappointed. Would have requested a refund from Amazon, but in the Xmas rush we tossed the box, don't have anything but the unit and accessories anymore. Will be contacting the company. - Mom to John, age 4"
1,Absolute Total Junk...& Overpriced,"Im very glad I didnt buy this item personally....It was given to me as a a gift..Worked allright for about 3 months or so...It is a bit complicated to use, many buttons that seem really unneccesary. Why would you want to shut the screen off while its on? BTW it does that by itself...All of the sudden it stopped working and the on indicator light just flashes constantly...The item price at the time of purchase was $199, now its on sale for $119 I believe...either way too much...Stick with a brand name (Sony etc) portable Dvd player and buy it at a store in person, to facilitate easy returns, and get the extended warranty if kids will be handling it...ANyone wanna buy a broken DVD player?"
1,DVD Player with Problems,"I charged this DVD player a week before Christmas, and then wrapped it. When my kids opened it, the battery was dead. I recharged it and then tried to put in a movie. The movie would not load without pushing down very hard on one spot on the top. I thought that the tablet feature was great, but I think this was what caused the loading trouble. As for holding a charge, after reading other reviews it sounds like this is a common problem."
1,Not a solid product,"I bought my first dvd and the picture was not working. I return it and got another one, used for 2 days, it was great, but then I lost the picture and voice, all what i hear is a hum. I'm returning the second one and will be looking for another brand."
1,"find another dvd player, this one is terrible",this is the 2nd one i have owned. both have been defective. i only used this item 1 time. the 2nd time the screen was black. very unhappy!!!!
3,Bland sounding,"This is not the sound that was expected, but it was good to hear the familiar sounds of the back days,"
1,The cost is prohibitive!,"I returned this product because of its ridulously exaggerated price. The price has tripled since my last purchase; at which time I paid $6.96 each and I purchased six. The price has now escalated to $19.95 each in the space of months. Some one, either Amazon or Proctor and Gambel, needs to take a close look the marketing of this product since it it not available in any store and the price online is outrageous. Maybe they (P&G) just don't want to make and sell it any more. But at $19.95, I'll find something else to use; and I've been using this product since I was sixteen and that's fifty five years ago!"
1,?,"I felt like I was prisoned in a small room without any window, without any fresh air, at first I was bored, pretty soon, I become asphyxiated. Dissapointing. It's too bad that I still have to put at least one star for this rating, but if I had the option, it will be no stars at all."
1,greatest pseudo-literature,"d.h. lawrence sure is good at inflating banalities, the whole book is a mere concatenation of pseudo-intellectual, relentlessly boring blabber, some plot interspersed.for real literature read madame bovary."
2,Difficult,"Difficult to concentrate on, due to headaches and the fact that the narrative wasn't lively enough. Next... (C)"
2,Lady Chatterley's Lover,"I'm over half-way through the book and I'm struggling not to just throw it away. It's moving very slowly & written in language style that is hard to move quickly through. I'm amazed that someone thought if I enjoyed reading ""50 Shades"", I would enjoy this book. So far, that's a joke. I'm haviing trouble even staying awake while reading this book."
2,Lady Chatterley's Lover,"For years and years, I had heard nothing but good reviews for this book. So, I decided to purchase it on my Kindle.I am so glad that I purchased at a deep discount because after reading the book I'm glad I did not pay full price.From the beginning, I had a hard time getting into the flow of the book. I would not recommend this book unless youcan purchase it at a really deep discount."
4,Beautifully Sexy and Simple,"I was afraid this book would turn into an erotic Pride and Prejudice with drawn out subplot and hollow or pretentious characters. They were pretentious but I felt a kinship with each. The social life a wealthy person often experiences in this age is cut down to a few essentials and the characters are well chiseled so they are simple to track. The erotic scenes were surprisingly tame or cut short. There was far more philosophy about life, people, and sex than I anticipated. I enjoyed these sections as much as the sex, though for different reasons. The eroticism is more based on the uncomfortable moments of being naked together or initiating sex. These awkwardly unfolding moments gave a sense of realism mostly gone from modern erotica."
1,"Too narrow, too short","The Serta 3-lb Memory Foam Mattress topper, Queen 1 1/2 inch arrived very quickly (I live in New Jersey). I am disappointed first because it feels like regular foam, not memory foam, and more importantly, because it has been cut too small for the standard queen mattress. It's both shorter and narrower by about two inches than the standard Queen-size mattress. Since it is very bulky and hard to repackage back to its shipping size it is very difficult to send back, which makes the sizing defect all the more annoying."
5,Very Comfortable,"I purchased this because my bed provided by my apartment gives me exactly as much comfort and support as sleeping on a piece of plywood. So this was necessary. I also wanted to get a mattress pad that wouldn't make it impossible to put on the sheets I already owned, so it is a little on the thin side, but it's what I expected.Yes, this mattress pad is smaller than a full-sized bed by a few inches on each side, but it is easily remedied by just putting the gap between the mattress and pad where you put your pillows. Totally unnoticeable, unless you sleep with no pillows.The pad also folded out very easily. It was a really hot day when I had to carry it on the bus to my apartment, so that may have helped ""warm it up"" to about 110 degrees before being unrolled. The smell is also totally not that bad. Noticeable, but really not bad. I get migraines and nauseous very easily, and have not had either from the smell."
4,um....yes,"If u like cypress hill as a rap group then u will like the first cd,ifu like rock then the second.Overall this was a good,rap/rock superstar are both good and valley of chrome along with some other songs."
5,cYpREsS HiLL!,"Cypress Hill rocks, no, really, in this album, they do. I like Fear Factory's guitarist on all of the Bones disc. Skull is better, though."
3,Ain't that unique no more,"Their first three are classics, but they've become different from what they were since IV. Become less distinctive from other rap artists. I felt they're somewhat struggling between the two lines in the new album. The Bones disc doesn't cover my expectation for them. They could rock(or rap) better than that."
4,Cypress Hill is brakin some skulls and bones,This cd is awesome.I like 10 of the rap songs and only 1 of the rock songs.So I would say the skull disc is alot better.But if you like rap or rock or both than this cd is a must by.i would of gave this cd a 5 but I don't like most of the rock songs.This cd is brand new and i suggest you get before its old.Peaceout and keep bawling
2,"One good, One more than bad","This new album is a pure deception. The skulls CD(rap) is quite good, but too short. The second, bones, AHHAHHHAH, the second one. That's the worst thing I ever heard by a rap artist, what the hell is that, heavy-metal/punk/hardcore. Is B.Real and SenDog the singers ? I don't know, I can't recognize their voices in the ""noise"". Really, Really disappointed. Anyway, rent it before buy it, that a piece of advice."
4,Much like the Classic,"As a person who's rumored to have been playing Trivial Pursuit since she was six years old, I have to admit that version 6 of this game has to be one of the better ones to come along in years. Much like the first Genus edition, the questions have a great range in both subject matter and level of difficulty. However, a problem plagues Trivial Pursuit 6 that has plagued all other recent editions: NOT ENOUGH QUESTIONS. After about 5 full length games, I found myself and my companions repeating the questions! Trivial Pursuit 6 has about half the number of question cards that Genus I (from 1979) had. The new version 6 is great if you're a casual player who won't play it that often, but for any die-hard fans, this game is going to get really old really quickly."
4,great radio but.....,My grandmother gave me this radio for christmas and i love it alot. the light up mirror is totally cool and the fuzzyness is great to but the radio won't play on certain stations. overall i would give it 4 stars.
3,Great Quilt ~ Directions are AWFUL!,"First off ~ I must say the quilt will be lovely when put together, I have added the sashing and I made flying geese for the border of this quilt...next comes the hand quilting. And the story of each block is nice too.But PLEASE do not follow her directions, they are awful. After many attempts at her directions, I ended up following the old standby directions for the blocks. It's quite easy if you look at the size the pieces of the block should be before sewing them together. For some reason she uses more steps then needed to make a block. Do not buy her Flying Geese template...waste of money. There are a lot of errors in the measurements, especially in the Bear Paw block..if you follow her directions you'll end up 1/2"" too big (claw part). I had to square them down to size after the second attempt.A nice quilt...bad directions...not a Quilt in a Day, but worth the try."
2,I may have played it once or twice - don't remember.,It probably looked good when I downloaded it. But I can't remember anything about it - Hum a few lines and maybe I will recall.
5,Xikar Cutter,Works exactly as claimed. I am very pleased with this purchase just as I am with all the Xikar products I have purchased.
1,Greedy Kindle Pricing,Why is the Kindle Edition of this book so high??? $3 cheaper than the hardcover is NOT what I signed up for when I purchased my Kindle. GREEDY!!
1,"Content of book - 5 Star, Kindle Edition readability - 1 Star","First I'd like to note that the content of this book is wonderful. The conversational style makes it a quick read and the advice and plan for working with a leash-reactive dog is the best around. The discussions about what to do when ""life"" happens is great common sense and will give any dog owner more confidence walking a reactive dog.As for the quality of the Kindle version -- it's terrible. The font is not crisp, many words are broken, and it's difficult to read. It's as if they took a hard copy, scanned it on a low-end scanner, and then converted to a file. This is the 1st time I have run into a Kindle book like this. It needs a re-do in Kindle format."
3,Very thin book,I am sorry I didn't use the money I spent on this to buy another Dog Whisperer book or video by Ceasar Millon.
5,Suzuki's Zen Buddhism,An excellent book on Zen Buddhism by a distinguished 20th century scholar. I highlyrecommend this book to anyone interested in Zen Buddhism.
5,Where Do I Stand?,"Where do I stand?I have no legs.This room, this floor;Moment after moment,Light flickers on and off.Not on, not off.I do not know."
4,"focus on the finger, and you'll miss all the heavenly glory","this is the second book that i have read by dt suzuki. i started with 'introduction to zen...' where 'introduction' was just that, and introduction to many of the ideas of zen, this book extracts from several other writings to focus in greater detail on different subjects in zen. one chapter that i was excited (but later left feeling wanting for more) about was a comparison of zen with existentialism. furthermore, i feel as though i got enough out of the 'introduction...' that much of this book was superfluous. however, that which i did appreciate were the chapters on the history and development of zen that was lacking in the 'introduction...'"
2,Translation too Archaic,I heard that Pickthall's translation was quite good... but I don't think so. It sounds like it was written in the 1800's. I consider myself to have a good vocabulary but lots of the words/expressions in there are just too old fashioned for me to understand without straining!!I'm going to order a good-ol' Yusuf Ali translation
5,Works Great-Had One for Five Years-Used on 2nd Mailbox,"I just replaced my standard size mail box with another one, and forgot I had this bracket. I used stainless steel screws, and they worked fine for the second box. Only required 4 screws to take the old one out and put the new one in. We use a 4X4 post that looks likeBw Creative Wood Ind Intl 4X4x72' Pt Mailbox Post At991 Mailbox Posts. My mailbox is black, so the bracket does not show. There is a small edge, maybe 1/8"" to 1/4"" that would show if your mailbox is another color. It was an excellent bracket for this application, and showed no signs of wear, after at least 5 years. No hassle at all to replace the mailbox."
2,"Well, it was supposed to fit the mailbox. Universal bracket, right??","I purchased a relatively cheap (inexpensive) Gibraltar mailbox. The mailbox did not include a bracket to attach the mailbox to the post. No biggie, what do you expect for $7.95, right? On the mailbox packing container, there was a note that said that they recommended the Solar PLMB molded mailbox bracket. You would think that the holes on the bracket would have aligned with the holes on the mailbox given this recommendation. Well, two of the holes lined up! Two out of four ain't bad, so I give the bracket a two...or is that the mailbox that should get a two!! Nothing wrong with the bracket (per se) or the mailbox, just the people who did the QA on the two items (quality assurance)."
4,It Works & is Convenient & Easy to Use,"This mounting board is designed to fit several sizes of mailboxes, and it helps make installation very easy. A board or plywood could be used, but this would require custom-trimming the board. Also, this board is weather-proof."
4,The real Bible,This is a good book for the beginner who knows that the earth is 4 billion years old..The types of fossils discussed are perfect for the average collector..Not too big like dinosaur bones. This is not a book on how to prepare a fossil collected. Just a reference to the identification of a fossil.Note..There are a few typo errors like missing pages but it is still a good book for the starter..
4,"Very helpful, very informative","I've read and looked through a lot of ""pre-pregnancy"" books over the past few months but this one is not only the most helpful and up-to-date one I've come across, but also it is the LEAST panic-inducing. So many other books devote more than half the text to fertility problems, which only served to heighten my paranoia and fear about that very issue. This book took a very calm and rational approach to ALL topics that need to be covered during the pre-conception time, and I really appreciated that.I also really liked the tone of this book. It was friendly and informative yet confident and authoritative. I did not feel like there was lecturing going on (which is good as lecturing, let's be honest, can sometimes trigger a ""I don't care what you say, I'm gonna do such-and-such anyway!"" reaction), but rather like the authors were part of my ""preconception team,"" working WITH me and my husband towards achieving the goal of a healthy and happy pregnancy."
5,My Favorite Childhood Book!,"This was my absolute favorite childhood book! I read it at least 1000 times! It allowed me to fantasize what it was like to be a rich little girl and travel to Paris (something I still haven't done!). It also gave me an interest in learning French, which I studied for 10 years. Most of all, it allowed me to see that being a strong, freeminded, quirky girl (woman) was OK. Eloise doesn't have a hard time saying what she means or doing what she wants even though it may not be conventional. A good role model for little girls!"
5,Bain de Terre Recovery Complex 4.2 oz,"My hair tends to be dry no matter how much I condition it. My wife told me to try the Bain de Terre product (she wasn't using it very much). WOW an immediate improvement that leaves my hair smooth, not oily, and no frizz or dryness! Now I catch my wife swiping my bottle to apply on her hair after getting out of the pool to help detangle and comb her hair without any struggle or breaking. This stuff is the bomb."
1,waste of money,"After reading about this product in an issue of Lucky, I decided to try it. It actually made my hair more staticky and frizzy, and pretty greasy. It was a pretty expensive purchase for such a useless product."
3,under the hammer,"I like both starring actors of this series,so I was a little disappointed with the story line. It was a little disjointed. Could have been better written."
2,Picture book to show the ladies,Doesn't really help you unless you really know nothing about jack russels and don't need it solely for making girls gawk at pictures at cute puppies...
4,The Mixes are better,than the Album Version.I wasn't crazy about the song but the Mixes more than made up for it.worth seeking out.
4,En-lighting Information,"It is amazing to read about people's medical issues from the past, 70 years ago. They are no different as of present day. What is of interest is how simple and basic changes in a persons lifestyle and food intake, can change your whole body. So far I find this book to be helpful and en lighting. It is not a novel to read cover to cover, but to pick a specific subject! SLIP.S. So far I have lost 30lbs just with some minor changes in my food and drink intake, and the edema in my legs have been reduced."
1,Foods For Health and Healing,"The information contained in the book is excellent, but the format renders the information nearly useless. The format of the book should be chapters and foods by the type ailment, not the type food. The format as I purchased would require hours of reading to get all the information about any specific ailment. Terrible, I would never purchase another book by this author and the price I paid for this one in for all practical purpose just wasted."
3,GO! Soundtrack,"The first five songs are good especially Natalie Imbruglia song which is great. What album is it from? Len and no doubt gave the album a bit of life. Anyway, a dissapointing second half of the album as it gets a bit repetitive ZZZZZZzzzzzz. Overall-OK!"
5,Fun 'cult' album!,"Whilst watching the movie it came to me how well the score was chosen, it really adds something to the movie. As in most good movies where they pay a little attention to the soundtrack you can't help but notice. Most tracks are fun listening to on their own, but if you've seen and liked the movie it's definitely worth buying. Some here think it's mediocre, to me it's more 'cult' á la the Pulp Fiction soundtrack. It's nothing too heavy or serious, but just good fun. And what's wrong with that? ;-)"
3,shipping,"Happy with the product (and I like it with water), but I'm not happy with the shipping and the cost. For 62+ oz of this product I paid $66.35 including $12.50 for shipping. Thru another company today I purchased 76+ oz for $41.63 including $5.99 shipping. Today I'm really happy."
4,Very yummy,"I've been drinking the pre-mixed Chocolate Royale shakes sporadically for about 10 years and I find the chocolate taste in the powder to be a lot tastier than the premixed shakes! I was very pleasantly surprised. I didn't give it the 5th star because it never seems to mix fully. I took the advice of others and use it in a shaker, but it still never mixes perfectly for me. I have NOT tried it in a blender though, so that might help. Also, rather than drinking it at once as a meal, I sip it over an hour or so as a beverage, so it separates a lot and needs to be reshaken during some of that time. I'm the kind of person who is hungry every two hours or so and that is still the case with the shakes, but the plan DOES include a snack between shakes, and an apple is sufficient to get me between my morning shake and lunch."
2,Wrong Picture of Product,"I bought this dish drainer based on the picture, thinking it was the older version, heavy, rubber, non-antimicrobial drainer. It is not. It IS the new, light, plastic, antimicrobial model which I did NOT want. However, today a salesperson from Ace Hardware told me only the light weight, plastics drainers are available from now on. Sigh."
2,Poor. Not very helpful at all.,"Language/30 ""Learn French Today"" teaches you nothing about basic grammar, and instead provides the listener with a phrasebook you could buy in a travel shop. Instead of learning how to say ""I would like"" and ""She likes"" and ""they are bringing me this"" etc. etc., all it teaches you are questions. ""I would like to see the menu"" and ""can you direct me to the toilet?"" are such phrases that you would learn upon listening to the two tapes provided, and such is the dynamic nature of the French language that there is a multitude of grammatical aspects to the language. One cannot pick up French just by listening to questions.So in short - don't buy these language tapes 'cos they're a waste of money and time. If you want to learn the language, take a class. That works.But still, je ne parle pas bien Francais!!!!!"
1,Returning this flimsy binder,"I bought this exact binder (model 79982) at a local office-supply store. The cover was peeling off before I even got back to the office, revealing the cardboard-like frame underneath. ""Heavy duty""? I'm returning it.The one-touch open/close mechanism is nice though, so I'll give 1 star for that."
2,Disappointing,Not what I expected. Almost every aspect of this video did not live up to my expectations. Gusee I will sell it on e-bay.
3,IT WAS SO SO,"SINCE THESE GUYS GOT THEIR SHOT AT FAME YOU CAN HERE IT IN THEIR VOICE.LIKE WHEN 50 GOT WITH AFTERMATH, LIKE AN EROGANCE(NEVER BOUGHT A 50 ALBUM. FYI). LIKE THEIR TRYING TOO HARD. I'VE LISTENED TO THE ALBUM 1 AN HALF TIMES AND GOT BOARD. I DON'T KNOW, I GUESS I AM GETTING TOO OLD FOR THE BOASTING AND BRAGGING ABOUT HOW TOUGH YOU ARE. I LIKE TO HERE SOMETHING THAT MEANS SOMETHING.I LIKE #2 WITH BUSTA DOING HIS THING.I WOULD LIKE T0 SEE MORE OUT OF THESE CATS."
2,I'm sorry but I didn't like this product. ...,I'm sorry but I didn't like this product. It made my hair feel very greasy and sticky. I'll probably never buy this again or recommended it. It also flattened my hair.
4,The Woman as Saviour,"Whatever you might think that the anti-detective novel The New York Trilogy is about it ultimately boils down to love. The love of writing, the problem of authorship and last but not the least the love of a woman. In the three novels the narrator shifts in character. First he is Quinn working under the alias of his fictional character Work who presumes the identity of Paul Auster the detective who in turn .. I think you get my drift. What do all theese characters have in common? They are all trying to describe the world in words. They all fale it seems. All but one, the last character in the last book, the nameless narrator succedes. Why? Because of the love of a woman (Sophie - the ""madonna"") who teaches the authors alias that writing is secondary to love, the keystone in life."
3,detached perspective on the world,"The stories are well written, easy to follow and maintain a consistent flow. Which is all very commendable because this is difficult to do. But the greatness stops there. The characters are likeable enough, but for some reason, I did not care about them. I can not explain why either. Gradually, I just lost interest. Perhaps it was because of the style of the author. Possibly, the text is too perfect. By that I mean that it lacks passion, energy and --- elan -- or something. Again, I can not put my finger on it. Auster seems to be like a voyeuristic, transcendent being, detached from the world, watching things from above, simply recording events like a court reporter...... I really wanted to like this book. I just couldn't."
2,Trying to be Clever,"We read City of Glass for our book club and 8 out of 9 of us could not bear to read the last two stories of the Trilogy. Though we all agreed it was well written, it was a story that carried the reader all over the place without actually ever arriving anywhere. Was Paul Auster trying to be clever or was he trying to write a good story? I believe cleverness was his intent, and in this case it is a shame because I missed a potentially good narrative."
5,ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT,"HONESTLY, this book is amazing!! It gripped me from within and has provoked uncanny experiences:For instance I was in the Tube, here in London, and I was deep within the novel, reading all about coincidences and fate when I noticed the girl right beside me reading the same book! This may not be THAT unusual, but it stirred something deep inside me. I turned to her to show her my book and she said ""it's fantastic isn't it?"" I was incredibly moved by this coincidence but proceeded to get off at my stop.On the next train I took, I clearly remember thinking what would happen next regarding 'New York Trilogy'. So I was reading again, and this girl sitting opposite me leaned forward to me saying how ""absolutely brilliant"" the book was! Now, this I took to mean fate! I was on a high all day!I am presently looking for a flat in New York...."
1,Never Worked,This charger never worked. The charger light never came on. I had to return it for a refund. Other people had same problem. Buyer beware!
5,Mutukudzi unplugged....,"This is glorious heartfelt, soulful singing and playing. Mutukudzi navigates seamlessly from one song to the next. By the time you have finished listening, you have the impression of having heard one long sweet meditation on loss and redemption, while each individual song reflects the depth of his warmth and humanity. If you are looking for a timeless acoustic performance, GET THIS ALBUM!"
2,much ado about nothing,"While this book is an easy and entertaining read, there is no substance to it. Do not read if you are looking for serious treatment of alternative healing. Read instead something like Richard Gerber's Vibrational Healing. Another lack is that there is no contact information for the healers mentioned."
5,Pennsy Power Review,Great book! It features descriptive text and many pictures of every major steam class of the PRR from 1900 onwards and the electrics used through about 1960. A good read for the rail fan!
2,Not her best,"A grim, bizarre little novel with no sympathetic characters. Adolf bears scant resemblance to his real-world namesake. Except for certain cute allusions to the future Führer -- we learn where the brown shirts, the weird hairstyle, and the toothbrush moustache come from, for example -- Adolf might as well be a completely fictional young sap. The plot is haphazard. For some reason a bleak, Dickensian underworld figures prominently without significantly altering or influencing Adolf other than requiring him to do a lot of fleeing.Bainbridge's gift for depicting menace and squalor are put to much better use in her novel Watson's Apology."
5,Good,"Love all of Daniels music ,I like the beautiful music as well as his voice, my husband and I have a number of his cd 's and listen to them in the car all the time . Such FINE quality,love it."
4,Well done,"As a long time collector of the Mosin Nagant rifle and also having my research on these rifles in a number of different Medias, I am pleased to say Terence has done a fine job with his works on the Mosin Nagant. I think all new collectors should have this book as a guide and even long time collectors will find the book helpful. The author covers a lot of ground in this book so it is hard to be overly detailed but too be honest a definitive work on the Mosin Nagant would run into thousands of pages. I am glad to have been able to assist the author in the past and hope to do more in the future. A+"
4,Took longer than expected but worth the wait.,This took a while to get here but it was worth it. It fits in my sink great and it was not damaged. I'm all around happy with this buy.
5,Dish drainer,"Bought this as a silly surprise gift for my Grandmother, she was complaining how hers was looking all beat up and she couldn't find a white one to match her kitchen, she loved and all worked out great."
2,Product is okay.,This product is okay but no better than any other hairspray. And even though it says it is unscented - it has a distinct smell.
5,I absolutely love this CD,"A friend at work had this CD and offered it to me to listen to on a particularly stressful day. I loved it! I ordered this one and two others by Beegie Adair and play them all the time at home. I play them as background music and I've actually had friends for dinner who have inquired as to what CDs they were because they enjoyed them so much. I then ordered five more of the Love, Elvis CD to give as Christmas gifts!!!"
4,Most enjoyable,"I was surprisingly pleased with this disc, not being an avid Elvis Presley fan. It does not have the more intricate jazz that I like so much on Beegee's Sentimental Journey set. However, it is still very enjoyable music."
4,great product! but.................,"what a fine vessel. i recently put these watches in a pinyata at my kids birthday party, the kids were thrilled. But i only give it 4 stars for one reason.... were all out of 100 dollar bills to wipe our asses in so now weve gone back to normal toilet paper =("
1,RIPOFF !!!,"I wish there was a ZERO stars rating. I got one. It sucks!!! It keeps horrible time.OK, at first I thought WOW, I just spent my kids education money on something REALLY COOL... then buyers remorse set in. Oh man. I am now attending AMA meetings (Amazon Anonymous) - I have such guilt and emense pain. Maybe I can sell this on E-bay for a profit... I am depressed."
5,WOW,I came on here looking to purchase TS. I still can't find it I have been looking everywhere. Well as I was searching I found this watch. I took one look at this watch and was like OMG I totally need this watch. The other reviewers were wrong this watch is DLOG x 20. I bought two of them and forgot all about the TS. I will have to look for it later. This watch is good for all things and that my friends is as DLOG as you can get.
1,You have got to be joking,"There are people people in the world that dont have anything to eat, and then there is people the spend about a quarter million dollars on a watch."
5,Wonderful Watch,"This is simply the best watch you can buy for this low price. I bought one for my wife, and one for each of my 13 female children. Now for myself, I have an Omega men's constellation, I also bought one for each of my 14 boys."
3,"good concept, ok book","I heard him speak on an NPR program. I love the idea of how the ego and self are separate. The book was a little disappointing, though. In my opinion here are too many pages devoted to the argument of why this is plausable, and not enough to how it can manifest in daily life."
1,Straight garbage!!!,"Nothing but garbage from beginning to end. This must've taken N.O.R.E. all of two days to put together...at least that's how it sounded. He's never been a strong lyricist (but I still liked N.O.R.E. and God's Favorite), but this puts him at the very bottom of the skilled lyricist list.Don't waste your money!!!"
2,Don Johnson doing another cop movie,"I like Don Johnson most of the time. This is not one of those times.. Just not a very good movie. Just not very engaging. A fair amount of action but after I watched it, I had to look at the back to remember it. Enough said."
4,A Must Have For Beginners!!!,"This is a great dvd for beginners. Of course nothing beats a real instructor, but this is a great alternative if you want to learn guitar at your own pace on your schedule at a fraction of the cost. The first chapters do alot of thorough explaining and show alot of step by step examples. I know absolutely nothing about guitars or reading music off charts or tabs. This dvd explains everything a beginning guitarist needs to know about charts, tabs, and chords. However certain areas get very very advanced quickly. If you're a slow paced learner like me this can be intimidating. Just go over previous lessons over and over till you feel comfortable before moving on. If you listen to the lessons and follow them exactly, this dvd will help out alot. Remember you get out of it what you put into it. This dvd has ALOT of info for new guitarists. If you are more advanced the instructor Mark John Sternal has a series of lessons on dvd of all types. Hope this helps."
5,Just right,"Bought this for my son, who was in the process of interviewing for an internship in investment banking. He got an offer from a prestigious Wall Street firm. Coincidence? Or was it this book? Either way, everybody here is very happy with my purchase!"
5,Great book for weekend projects!,"This is a terrific book for weekend projects-my husband and I built the glider swing in a weekend and it was very easy. We do have lots of previous woodworking experience but could tell that someone with less or no experience would be able to follow the instructions. Since we do have some experience there were a few things we noticed-check your shopping list against your cut list and see what the cheapest way of buying your wood will be. We found that we didn't need a few of the boards we bought (but if you plan on building more of the projects, this is not really a problem!). Also, look at the picture of the finished project and check it against your hardware list. We found that we were missing 4 spring loaded snap rings (the book calls for 4-you will need 8). All things considered, the book is great and has projects that anyone can build! If you were to buy many of these items they would cost you three to four times as much as it does to build them."
1,Another great artist lost to proselytism,"Everybody has political and religious positions, and they influence what one does as a professional. However, as a general rule, artists do much better when they stay away from proselytizing in their artistic work.This CD has been a terrible disappointment to someone who has been a big fan of Juan Luis Guerra over the years."
1,lastima,me da lastima porque suena bien pero no creo que llevarlo a tanto al mensaje sea bueno eramos muchos los fans y ahora me imagino que quedaran los mas apegados a ese tipo de mensajes
2,"Juancho, baby, this one is just too much...","As if 4 more years of George Bush weren't enough! Now we need to endure Juan Luis Guerra's return as a born again Christian. Hmmmmmm.... I've been a big fan of yours for years, Juancho, and I tried hard with this one, but it's just a little too much for me. (I do like the one about the wasp, and perhaps not coincidentally, it is one of the few non-religious tunes in there. Or did you mean WASP? Yikes...!) With all due respect, I wish you and your religious following, the best of luck."
5,Very Good Praise Music,"When I bought this CD I had high expectations, and it did not let me down. It has some songs with plenty of rhythm to dance to and others that usher you to presence of God. If you are wondering, this is a Christian album, and if you have never bought a Christian album before this would be a good one to start with. It will show you what a relationship with God is about: praise, love, comfort, laughter, faith and hope.God Bless and enjoy"
5,dulce merengue,"I have heard Juan Luis Guerra famous singles in the past, but this CD is exceptional."
4,I love Cat Fancy,"Cat Fancy is a wonderful cat magazine with great infomation on health issues,new products,uplifting stories and a new breed profile every month.The only thing that is wrong with Cat Fancy is it has too many ads in it for breeders.I would recommend Cat Fancy to all Cat Lovers."
5,Meow!,"I have subscribed to this magazine for years! I enjoy reading all of the articles, and of course the beautiful pictures of all the cats. I have 3 cats and have found several tips on diet and overall health very helpful. I now know why there is som many cat owners that subscribe to this magazine."
5,cat magazine,i look forward to getting my monthly Cat Fancy...very informative and interesting for cat lovers...
4,Great lotion -- Lousy dispensing method.,"The Skin Bracer Pre-Electric lotion by Mennen is excellent. Five stars for the lotion itself. What is extremely irritating is the dispensing method. I've not found a way that doesn't make a mess. The bottle cap pops off instead of twisting and that's fine. But the dispensing hole of the inner cover in the bottle is 6.8 mm wide! More than 1/4"". I've tried tilting the bottle slowly to put liquid into my cupped palm, I've tried plugging the hole with a finger and then slowly releasing finger pressure, I've tried putting the bottle top to a cheek and then tilting it slightly to put lotion on, and none of these methods work well. Excess lotion gets all over the inner cover, runs down the bottle, and leaves a mess to clean up on both the bottle top and the inner cap. Whoever designed this dispensing method at Colgate-Palmolive certainly did not have 'convenience' and 'ease of use' in mind."
2,Not that great.,"We have both the Sea Salt variety and the Cinn. Sugar. The Sea Salt variety are almost Toooo salty. You can only eat a couple at a time. On the other hand..the Cinn. ones are good, but you have about 7 chips in a bag that could hold about 50 !!! Not worth the money!!!!!!"
1,Title of this video describes the appropriate audience,"I purchased this DVD for my 3 1/2 year old son thinking it might help him learn a little bit about the game of golf, with some instructions on how to swing. However, this DVD turned out to be a bunch of kids driving around in miniature battery operated golf carts doing what ever they want, and chasing some guy dressed up in a bad wolf costume. Also, if you want your kids to learn some golf etiquette, this is defiantly not the DVD for you, the children on the video for the most part are left to do whatever they want on a golf course, including driving the carts around on greens. No educational value, great for babies who want to watch children swing clubs hap hazardly and watch an ugly wolf run around."
5,Always cold,Soldiers who were there say they where never that cold before or after the war. A great battle but too little is know of each different segment of the front lines.
1,annoying!!!!,"is as simple as that: this work is annoying because of the excessive use of the cry-baby pedal, that just get in my nerves. it's a shame, this was an excellent band (elegy is the finest!!!)"
1,Is this Amorphis?,"I can't believe that a great band such Amorphis comes back with this piece of crap album.What happened??Maybe these guys were short of money and they needed to change their style in order to fit more with the Alternative fans.I cant believe that after their great Artworks such ""Tales from the Thousand Lakes"",""Elegy"" and prior releases,they can fall so down."
4,Great role for James Franco,"Having seen James Franco's poor performance as the Green Goblin's son in ""Spiderman,"" I was expecting the same for this. I was very impressed with his performance as De Niro's doped-out son in this though. ""City By the Sea"" had excellent character development, great makeup, realistic situations including harsh dialogue, and an interesting plot. The previews are deceiving, making the movie look like a murder mystery, which it wasn't. This is not a film that I would recommend to children, for its R rating reflects strong language, drug use, and violence. It might help people to appreciate their relationship with their parents/children though. All in all, this was a very good movie with great performances. Don't let James Franco's disappointing role in Spiderman keep you away."
1,False Positives,"I purchased the 3 pack and used them one day after another. The first time I got an evaporation line, the second one, I received a dark, very thin, blue positive line right away, and the third was a faint line within the 10 minute timing window. During the time of these Clearblue test, I was also using some of the wondfo and a dollar store test and they all came up negative. I read many many reviews stating how clearblue has a lot of false positives. So disappointing and a waste of money, not to mention heartbreak.My opinion is...go get a First Response or a dollar store test. I gave it one star only because that is the minimum you can put."
2,Not very useful,I had a canon printer that kept slipping papers. So I applied this to the rollers. Imagine my reaction when the rollers grabbed so strongly over 50 pages got stuck inside the jammed printer.Oh well.
1,Disappointing at best!,"Being from Detroit, had hoped that what I remembered from this album when it was originally released would still excite my Detroit blood. It doesn't. It's boring. Mitch Ryder peaked with the DETROIT album and lost everything he had afterwards."
2,can't digest the fungi,"i was not mazed by this collection. it was strange, in a way. great descriptions in one story, incredible shallow in another. good well developed style in one story,like a child writing in another. amazingly unoriginal in some stories. never really inventive. but the most sad thing was how Lumley kept from being interesting. oh, by the way: don't hate the man, know he's got some good stories."
1,Terrible to say the least.,I kind of feel bad for my trashcan for having to hold this cd until trash day! This may be the worst cd I've ever heard.
2,Nice price,"The price is great, however I would recommend spending twice the money and buying one of the Lamaze soft toys. My baby only will play with these when I initiate play, whereas she will entertain herself with the Lamaze toys (e.g. Clutch cube, Pupsqueak, Allie cat, Buzz or Celeste) for a long time, Pupsqueak and Buzz being her favorite ones. There is just so much more to explore on the Lamaze toys that it does not get boring for baby.The infantino duo is though durable and washable."
5,Makes History Fun!,"This book is a gift for a home schooling mom like me, who frequently fell asleep in my history classes in school! It really evokes the excitement, mixed with fear that must have been present at that time in history. Longfellow perfectly captures the passion and determination that gripped these ""patriots"". In addition, the illustrations are fantastic - true art."
3,"It felt like plastic. Though, after a while, ...","It felt like plastic. Though, after a while, it became comfortable. But it wasn't really spectacular."
1,BIG MISTAKE DONT HURT YOURSELF,USED THIS PRODUCT TWO TIMES AND STARTED TO SMELL AND SEE SMOKE NOT SAFE DONT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY
1,poor performing product,I have a very small yard and have been using a small/basic gas trimmer for approx. 8 years. The gas trimmer was giving me trouble so I decided to try an electric trimmer. This trimmer is not adequate at all. It seems to have enough power but the line is very thin and gets chopped off after the slightest use. The line extension mechanism (with the tap) does not work. I used this product only once and decided to return as it was very frustrating to use. Just doesn't do the job even for a light duty small yard.
1,Toro 15 inch 4.4 amp,"I bought this Toro in 2007; to date I have been able to use it maybe 10 times. I do not have the strength to unscrew the spool cap to add new string or just to loosen what is bound up on the spool. I have to carry it over to my neighbor and he uses a pair of big pliers to hold the spool so he can unscrew the cap. What a nuisance this thing is. I have bothered my neighbor so much I am embarrassed. The cap that slipped into the slot on both sides was easy to unlatch and replace. If you do not much strength in your arm/hands ""DO NOT"" buy this product.You might wonder why I didn't complain earlier; I thought with regular use the cap would become easier to loosen, alas not so; if anything it is worse than it was when new. So, for two full summers I have relied on my little 13 inch that I paid $30 for probably 8 years ago. I have a very large yard and it takes me quite awhile but I eventually get it done. Your company used to make superior products; not anymore. What a disappointment."
3,Encyclopedia of Antiques tools & Machinery,Not quite what I needed. I do not get much usefull information from it.
2,the sagacity of sheepishness,"Worse ""self-help"" books exist. Problem is, this is just a primer for what you already know. Psychology East and West is Watt's most substantial book--head west young man."
5,No words.,Just read this book and appreciate it like you would appreciate a fine Mozart composition.
3,Starts off strong,I thought the book started off extremely well but towards the end it lost my interest a little bit and I found myself just trying to finish it .
5,This man changed my life.,"If you're scared to challenge beliefs you've always held to be true, don't touch this book. If you're ready to think about things in a way most people don't, this book could put you right on a path that's so fresh and inspiring, it's lead me to read every book Watts wrote and explore the various Eastern religions he always refers to. The Wisdom of Insecurity discusses extremely foreign and complex concepts in a way that is beautiful to read and calming to imagine."
3,I'd say these razors are mediocre at best. ...,"I'd say these razors are mediocre at best. I got a decent shave, but have had closer with other disposables. Also, there are razors on the market with much better handles. I found these to be too short and straight. I'd recommend other brands to friends over these."
4,Fun but will not last.,"I got this for my 1 year old son for Christmas and he loves it but, the paper wraping the blocks was coming off the first day, I went ahead and took the rest off and he is still having fun stacking and puting them the the box."
4,I play with it more than my kids,"I bought this for my 3yo and she plays with it once in a blue moon, I on the other hand love putting it together before I put it away."
4,perfect for the grandsons,"I bought this puzzle for my 5 year old grandson. The makers have a great history of puzzle making so I knew right away that this would be a hit with the little one as well as a durable product that will last. I was unable to see him get the puzzle (was shipped to him for his birthday) but I am certain not only he will love it, but his 8 year old brother will too."
1,Duplicate Blocks,This product was great! That was until we tried to put together the pig. That was when we realized that we have some duplicate pictures on some of the blocks. That means no matter how hard my daughter tries she can never get the picture to look right. So buyer beware that you might only have a few animals that your child can put together correctly. We did compare the blocks to the picture just to confirm the block mistake. I had my wife double check the blocks just to make sure. I would have rated it 4 stars except the pictures don't all match up. I don't know how long the blocks would hold up because the pictures are just stickers. Thankfully we bought it through amazon and just returned it.
5,great puzzle,"I'm surprised about the reviews on bad quality. My 2-year-old has been playing with his cube puzzle every day since Christmas (that's 3 months) and nothing has come off yet. We have a lot of fun solving the different animals. I have to help him, but little by little he's figuring out how to do his favorite animals by himself. We both think it is a great, fun toy."
4,best shave ever,I have been using the Panasonic wet dry shavers for over 20 years. I have had this model for about a year and it is sounding tired. If you use them in the shower you will get the closests shave possible with no razor burn. The older ones lasted longer but did not shave quite as good. I will start buying the less expense model and replace it when the blades need replacing. I also learned that if you shut the razor off before engaging the side cutter it lasts longer.
1,This is not a good way at all to learn a language,"I don't understand why this got so many good reviews because it's awful. It doesn't actually teach you how to do anything. It just gives you all these complicated examples and they start out with the hardest verbs. When you're trying to learn Spanish verbs, you must know how to conjugate each verb. It doesn't even explain how to do this at all. The vocabulary flash card section is about the only thing I've been able to use but I even noticed a few errors with that. I already learned quite a bit of Spanish in school so I only bought this to brush up on what I already knew. But if you're a beginner then don't buy this because you will not be able to learn the language."
2,Not what I was looking for.,"If you're looking for an easy and simple book, this would be the one. However if you're looking for some common phrases that make this story a classic, such as, ""Little Pig, Little Pig, Let me in!"" OR ""Not by the hair of my chinny chin chin,"" OR ""I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow your house in!,"" you won't be finding any of that in this book. Hope this helps consumers out there :-)"
4,Some overlooked masterpieces,"The live and cover songs you can either take or leave,depending on your preference for such material,but there are 4 true gems on this compilation.""Voodoo Chile"" is not on the same level of Hendrix's version,but it is a great piece.""Life by the drop"" is a simple,yet touching number.""Lenny""is a tremendous instrumental,its aching beauty very much in the spirit of ""Little Wing"".SRV's most underrated work is undoubtedly""Riviera Paradise"",a long,jazzy instrunental that has not gotten the recognition it deserves.Its magical evocation of sun drenched islands and lazy,carefree dreams borders on the classical works of Debussy.All in all another essential disc of SRV."
3,"Useful, inexpensive, durable","this is a Useful, inexpensive, durable lens, considering the price it is a goood deal to buy one of this specially for travelling and using it when we don't have space to carry different lenses or even more when we want to take pictures in conditions that we feel the equipment must be damaged (rain, snow). It is a good all purpose lens, the quality is good the only cons is since it is not compatible with TTL features for digital cameras, so you cannot use that with your hot shoe flash. If that is not a problem for you the it is not a bad choice."
4,Decent blade at good price,Purchased for table saw. Works fine as a combo blade. perhaps not the best in the market but certainly one of the best in its price range. Permashield coating works well to keep resin/pitch and rust off blade body.
4,Good product. They worked fine and the lubricated ...,Good product. They worked fine and the lubricated feature is a plus. The super-thin material provides a natural feel. This is the first time I've used this brand and will certainly use it more often in the future.
5,Excellent Movie,"""The Voyage of the Yes"" brings together two young men from basically opposite backgrounds, for an adventure that's far more than they had anticipated. Disaster happens, and the ending is happy and poignant."
5,Several others have already told you,"What some PEOPLE do not seem to understand this is a FANTASY book. Its not saying real witches are like this. I went through and read all the 1 star comments and felt like I was going to be sick. I guess these men and women do not understand a book to be FANTASY. ""Oh its so horrible it gives a wrong depiction on witches"" Yada Yada Yada. Get over yourselves.... ITS A FICTION BOOK!!!!"
4,Best of the rest,"In his later years, Dahl could still tell a cracker of an engrossing tale. This, along with ""Matilda"" are the best of his later works. The story is neatly developed and tied up, though squeamish readers may dislike the fact that the protagonist must remain a mouse at the end."
5,READ THIS BOOK!,"THE WITCHES is a great book! You should read it. It's about witches who want to turn kids into mice. The main character, who doesn't have a name, gets turned into a mouse and his pay back is to turn the witches into mice, too! Read this book and you can find out more about it."
1,Spreading hatred and prejudice,"I can only imagine the outcry if every occurrence of ""Witch"" in this book was replaced with ""Christian"" or ""Jew"" or ""Muslim""."
1,What are we trying to tell our children?,"That real Witches are deceiving? That they hate children? This book shows exactly the ignorance of society and how that ignorance breeds ignorance. If you are going to teach your children about real Witches, then why don't you find books that do instead of letting them read tales such as this. Would your child like a book about how Christians or Hindus or Buddhists or Druids are child-hating, deceiving people? I think not. Children are impressionable and it is up to you to show tolerance rather than ignorance. Educate yourself."
3,OK for easy listening,Fine for backgroud while you drive. But many tracks sound similar. Could have used more variety in instrumentation. Basically all horns.
3,SYJ,"I've just finished ""Friday Night at Honeybee's"" and found Ms. Andrea Smith to be an excellent writer and storyteller and she took her time in developing the characters. And as a jazz, blues and R&B; vocalist myself, I enjoyed all the references to music and the jazz greats of that time. The song titles and the names that I recognized made it very interesting for me. The book painted a picture of the life and times of when jazz and blues were ""in"". The ""gathers"" were very interesting and I could imagine the excitement of meeting the movers and shakers of the music during the time.However, I kept waiting for something to happen to excite me, for the story to take an unexpected turn that would ""wow"" me, something that would hold me for several days after finishing the book; and it did NOT happen. And, for that, I was dissappointed. But, I look forward to reading other books by this author as there is lots of potential for an exciting writer!"
2,Moonrise,"Moonrise, typical to the Warrior series, is about a cat who saves the world. Not literally, but almost. This one is decent, it's a good light read. It is not one of those books you'll remember three years from now though. It's a good read though.The cats have to get home from Midnight, but it won't be easy."
5,my daughter can't put it down!,This is the second series my 10 year old daughter has started reading.These books are addicting and keeps her interest. Highly recommend
3,The saddest book so far!,"This is the SADDEST book so far in the series. The cats continue their journey back to their clans, and face many hardships in the icy mountains. Midnight, the badger says only five will return instead of 6 cats. Someone.......not telling who, dies trying to save a mysterious cat tribe. I would say this is still a good book, however i still miss Firestar. But i guess his time is up in the prophecy. I might have thought that one of his daughters is a better choice to fullfill another prophecy. However, this is still a good book!"
4,"Great visual dictionary, but some words for students missing...","This dictionary appears to be a minature, softcover, two-language version of the Five Language Visual Dictionary sold by DK (Five Language Visual Dictionary). This book is small enough to be called a pocket visual dictionary and has an exceptional variety of clear, well-organized, indexed images.While some categories, like the human anatomy section, provide detailed vocabulary well beyond my needs, other sections are wanting of some basic classroom vocabulary. Words like binder and binder paper are not included, but I have yet to find another visual dictionary that includes them. It is still a great dictionary, and I recommend it to my Spanish I students as a means of linking Spanish vocabulary directly to images rather than always translating to English."
5,Great for easy going vocabulary learning,"I got in touch with DK's ""Visual Dictionaries"" collection when I started to live in China. I've got the ""Chinese/English/Spanish"" and the ""Chinese/Pinyin/English"" dictionaries. Now I bought several units of this ""Spanish/English"" for my workers.I manage a Spanish/Chinese company, so I encourage wy workers to learn at least English, but also Spanish if they want. I had the choice of buying for them also the tri-lingual version with Chinese, but I opted for this one.The whole collection is fully recomendable!"
2,Bad quality and zero posability,"These figures look pretty decent at first glance but when you take them out of the box you see how bad they really are. My superman broke in half (at the waist) when I took him out of the box! Add that to the fact that there are only an average of six points of articulation on each (only three on Wonder Woman!) and you see that these aren't very high quality figures. Amazo is transparent, which makes no sense whatsoever. He isn't an invisible character. I also don't like that, while superman's S and belt stick out from his uniform, Bizarro's are merely painted on. Only buy this item if you love doomsday and its on sale. It's not worth its list price by a long shot."
5,LOVE IT!,I LOVE LOVE LOVE this book!!!!!!!!! My daughter likes it a lot too although I think much of the humor is directed at the parents. I can see myself keeping this one around for a long time. I was actually giggling out loud the first time I read it. I do have to say that I was a bit worried about giving my daughter any ideas since she's such a picky eater but it's too funny not to share. I hope there are more in the Mabel series!
2,Stick with 3,"Stevie was the unsurpassed guitar master of his generation, and there are some wonderful tunes on this album. That said, Stevie really lost me here when he added the bland keyboards of Reese Wynans into the mix. Before it was a tight trio, but with the keyboards the sound meanders. Do we really need a middling Reese Wynans solo after Stevie rips it up? No."
4,Great Bonus Material!,"A fun album from Stevie Ray Vaughan and Double Trouble, though probably not quite his best. But it is probably his most straight forward effort, with a lot of medium paced, rockin' blues. Not too heavy. Not to hard. Just cool.""Ain't Gone 'n' Give Up on Love"" is an exception to this, with its wailing guitar work that makes it an album highlight. And ""Life Without You"" is a great track to close out the album...soulful, with some great melodies and a nice guitar fade out.Not his best album...but a good listen, nonetheless!Album sounds great, so high marks for the remastering.I can't imagine a fan of rock n' roll or the blues who doesn't like ""Little Wing."" Whether it's the original or covered in tribute, the song just speaks to people, and so it's nice to see it included here, as part of a pair of Hendrix covers. This, alone, is probably the best addition to any of these SRV remasters."
5,SRV's Best Album!,"Stevie Ray Vaughan never made a bad album in his all-too-brief recording career, but this CD stands as his finest work overall. If you could only own one of his albums, make it this one. A blues-rock classic which is essential in the CD collection of any rock/blues fan. Don't miss it."
2,Too much $$ for too little help,"Although I could get this little gizmo to work sometimes, it is quirky and, over the long haul, not worth the trouble. Once a stamp gets lodged in the mechanism, which can happen pretty quickly, everything is knocked off and it ceases to work properly. It relies on stamps being perforated to an exquisite level of perfection and cut exactly straight. Of course, they hardly ever are, so stamps get jammed. Save your money."
1,Complete rip-off!,"There is absolutely no way that the people who manufacture this expect anyone to ever use it.We had several people try it with a roll or two of stamps. Even if every second or third stamp didn't rip or stick together, it would still be slower then applying stamps by hand. Even loading it is difficult. You can have a few dozen stamps applied by hand in the time it takes to load. The only purpose of this thing is to sell and make money. The 5 star reviews here are completely fake. If you really want to spend money on this, just give someone $20.00 and save yourself the grief."
1,However make up your own mind...,"Personally I thought that this book was totally unbelievable. Whilst I am aware that it is FICTION I just could not get into it.The main character Rory is 25 years old and has never, well lets say ""explored"" herself. Give me a break! Then suddenly she is some sexual minx so sure of herself and what she is doing - I don't think this has ever happened to anyone!!!"
3,okay blade,"This 40-tooth Freud is quick & pretty smooth, but I find cuts aren't clean enough for prefinished trim or prefinished flooring installs.The stuff I do varies, but it's mostly small remodel work, so I just switched from my 10-inch miter saw to an 8-1/2-inch. Thought this blade worth a try, but I'll be looking for less aggressive cutting & more teeth for my own finer-cut needs."
4,a good cd,this is a cool heavy metal rock cd its got 2 good songs in faith and freak on a leash and there r a lot of other good songs so if ur looking a good rock cd get this
3,decent,its decent but y is ice cube here he is the worst performer but korn ruled i dont like bizkit orgy was good rammestien was good but only one song dont like incubus
1,Jean Nate,This product was awful. I will never purchase it again.It look gross coming out of the bottle and it made my skin feelcoated and gummy.I do love jean Nate's Fragerance and the bath powder.But not this body wash!!
2,Jack Nance has great hair,"If you don't like David Lynch's movies you will hate this one. I think he makes movies for himself and expects everyone else to pay for them. Well, there isn't much dialogue. But, I give it 2 stars for Jack Nance's hair do and when his girlfriends grandmother was preparing the salad for dinner she had a cigarettes dangling from her mouth with the ash inches away from the lettuce, that was hilarious. Otherwise I guess Mr.Lynch was trying be be profound with all the disjointed symbolism. Rent don't buy."
5,don't erase this,"stranger in a strange land. freaky as all get out. it moves a liitle slow,but i loved it. i had heard about this movie since my college days but had never seen it. it didn't disappoint.incomprehensible imagery coupled with aliens=eraserhead."
3,Strange dream.........but mine are stranger!,"Well.....I was let down by this film. I loved Lynch's Muloholland Dr. and I remember liking Blue Velvet, but after all the hype of this mind-bender, I wasn't as impressed as I wanted to be. I love deep mind-boggling films that aren't supposed to make sense, but this wasn't as atmospheric and creepy like other Lynch films. What I can I expect though; this is (I believe) Lynch's debut feature lenghth film, and he definately improved his work on other films. I heard that this was Lynch's commentary on the birth of this first child. That makes sense; I guess he was frustrated with being a new parent, and it shows in this film. I'd recommend it only to true Lynchian fans who are curious about all of his work and to people who like ambigious, confusing films.-Steven"
1,Couldnt stay awake,"Sorry...I've tried to watch this, I just fall asleep. Maybe it's the best classic ever, but I can't find out. I cant rate the DVD extras because I've only seen the VHS years ago."
1,20 years hasn't made this better with age.,"I saw this movie about 20 years ago at a theatre. I really did not like it then, but it always sticks out in my mind, so that whenever asked, ""What was the least favorite film you ever saw""?...Eraserhead immediately comes to mind...Just can't bring myself to watch it again to see if time has changed my outlook.Must have something going for it since a few people say they thought it was great..I have enjoyed other work by David Lynch,but just not this one. When I picture the movie poster all I seeis a younger Don King..."
5,A classic and benchmark in mood filming!,"I'm waiting for this film to be release on DVD! In hopes of more deleted scenes, Out-takes and directors comments! I can dream can't I? Or should I ask for what may be another Lynching of my peace of mind? It's dark, It's gloomy, and foreboding! The film got such a cold chilling edge on it. You have to focus on every frozen moment and capture the essence of feeling of every moment that you view scenes from Eraserhead. Cold as Ice and dead on with fear and loathing of the pain of living and dealing with things we cannot control yet still force our lives into. We can't paint it any other way better than David Lynch. There isn't a better work out by this extra ordinary director. You will have to either tie the viewer to the chair to watch this or threaten them off your x-mas list from watching it every month. I fully recommend this film for the open minded and thought pro-vocable public. It will make you thankful your neurosis aren't as obvious."
1,It had good intentions...i guess,"I can understand where people come from trying to say that it is brilliant in it's symbolism, but in all reality this is not a movie that the general audience would want to sit down and watch on any normal day. The movie leans too heavily on the symbolism, which just leads it to be disturbing and awkward. Most of the movie I was so anxious or disturbed by the images or long silences that I had to take a break. I had to look up the meanings behind the complex symbolism before I got what ti was tying to do, and found that it wasn't nearly worth the agony I went through in watching it all the way through. It's sick and boring."
1,Unwatchable,"I tried and tried and tried to watch this, but gave up after 30 minutes.I just don't understand anyone who like this."
2,Some folks are better off becoming painters,"David Lynch is odd. Odd and he's very talented. Eraserhead is a jumbled mess of mixed visual metaphors and adolescent tripe. Poor Jack Nance. Jack could be the sweetest guy in the world. He was (briefly) my apartment manager during the making of Lynch's Dune. He appears as lost in Lynch's film as Lynch clearly is himself.Is it art? Sure. Is it good art? It teeters on the fine line between dorky and cool. I can't say I recommend Eraserhead. There are moments that recall the absurdity of Dali (when he was still an important painter). Visually stunning but ultimately as vapid and empty as any amateur art project.For those folks that are interested (Lyncheads all I'd guess), Eraserhead is available at David's website. It's somewhat expensive but the print looks great although the narrative is as murky as ever. Lynch is a very talented director when working with the right screenplay. This just doesn't happen to be the right one."
1,poor,"I don't see why other people think this movie is good. Its very long, and full of nonsense. I like other works by Lynch, but this is just crap.It is about a person with strange hair who lives in a bizarre dreamlike world."
1,Sucks Big Time!,"All the plots were told in advance by the author before he tried to twisted them. The first several pages looked quite promising, but then it lost its mystery since the author stabbed all the balloons of the plots by himself. If I could see in advance what's coming up at the corner before I turned around it, I would not waste time going there to see what I've already knew. bore to death reading."
1,Yuchhhhhh!,How did this mess ever get pass the editors? So poorly written - so totally inconprehensible! They actually printed a hardcover version! The first book in a long time I trashed (literally). I wouldn't even try to give this book away... YUCHHH!
1,Save your money!,"This has got to be one of the worst books I have read in a long time. It is poorly written and the shifting point of view(sometimes within a single paragraph) is extremely annoying. The author's habit of having the narrator inject his own commentary is also incredibly irritating. I am a Creative Writing major in California and I have read better stories from beginning writers. The only saving grace for this book is the fact that if there are editors out there willing to publish this drivel, I can look forward to being published as well, easily. I wish I had saved my money when I bought this book. It's not worth the price."
2,Not very thrilling at all,"Thomas William Simpson's ""The Caretaker"" is about a salesman who receives an amazing job offer out of nowhere. A huge salary, and amazing new home, and a product that should be a huge seller--it all sounds too good to be true, and it (of course) turns out not to be true.Lurking in the background is a caretaker with an old score to settle, and the salesman, an obnoxious jerk, will be the one who suffers most, but not until he makes his wife's life miserable.""The Caretaker"" does not deal with a life-or-death threat throughout the majority of the salesman's torment, and the writing is not crisp enough to make the story one worth caring about. Nor is there any reason particularly to care about the financial and professional destruction of the salesman."
1,Too Basic,The book is too basic and it is more focused towards buying any kind of business. I was expecting more.
3,Hits and misses...,"Starts off with a bang and the promise of action and intrigue, but is dulled by the halfway mark, when I realised two painful truths:a) The titular secret weapon, at the end of the day, is really nothing spectacular; andb) An experienced reader will have guessed the identity of Jericho way before it's finally revealed. The exact same trick was used a decade ago by another British author, Gordon Stevens, but with more subtle clues.Apart from that, Forsyth should really have exercised some restraint. The narrative frequently halts for passages of pedantic detail. Also, some threads are needlessly long, the worst offender being the Israeli intrigue in Vienna, which is largely inconsequential. This really hurts the pace later in the book when brevity and smart use of narrative shortcuts would have helped in fostering the sense of urgency that the situation deserved."
5,"This is really EXCELLENT,Frederick, well done",I have never read any of Forsyth's books before but this book encouraged me to go and search for more of his books.well done Monseiour Forsyth. You are now in my 'Best Authors' List.
4,Where is the line separating fact from fiction?,"This novel mixes known fact and fiction in a high action thriller. In a race against time, the coalition forces in what is now known as the first Gulf War are trying to discover the true nature of Saddam Hussein's secret weapon, 'The Fist of God.'Complex interactions of national and individual interests add to the tension. While some technical detail is provided, it never overwhelms the action or detracts from the urgency.Highly recommended.Jennifer Cameron-Smith"
2,Writing in the Sand,A belated scissors and paste attempt to cash in on the first Gulf War. It reads like 50 magazine articles stitched together with a bit of 'Jane's' thrown in to keep armchair warriors like myself engaged. Characters are not even one dimensional - they are zero dimensional. Vacuous but readable in a disposable way.
4,Enjoyable read - holds your interest,"This book has a contemporary setting, and is more believablethan others in its genre. I really enjoyed it. It is readableand does not confuse or have too many characters to keep trackof."
2,Poorly welded rim(s),I purchased this as a gift for my nephew for Christmas. The rim was broken when removed from the box. I contacted Amazon and the immediately replaced it. However instead of replacing the rim they have to send the entire game and likewise you have to return a whole unit. Not a problem right?.....until less than a week later the new rim seperates due to poor welding!
2,"Good tunes, bad production and pressing","Don't get me wrong, these tunes are great. But this particular label did a poor job transferring to tapes CD. You will get the exact same recordings in much better format on other disks. Go straight to the source with ""The Best of the Gerry Mulligan Quartet with Chet Baker"" on Blue Note Records, ASIN B000005HGI. Or for a more complete collection, get ""The Original Quartet with Chet Baker"" a 2-disk set on Blue Note, ASIN B000007TFR."
2,Blade is only an 8 inch diameter one!,"If I wanted an 8"" diameter blade, that's what I'd order. I wanted an 8 1/4"" blade, hence I ordered this. Instead, I get an 8"" blade. It doesn't look like the picture shown, what they ship is clearly marked on the blade as being an 8 to 8 1/4"", which I guess means it is an 8"" blade that can also be used in an 8 1/4"" circular saw. They didn't ship the wrong item, it is clearly marked as being the Freud D0840X Diablo, the listing is at best misleading and clearly inaccurate. But dang it, I really wanted an actual 8 1/4"" blade which this listing leads one to believe that is what you get with this Freud D0840X. This listing needs to be updated and needs to use a current picture that actually matches what is being shipped (and showing the 8"" to 8 1/4"" print on blade)... THIS IS AN EIGHT INCH DIAMETER BLADE, PERIOD ...and should be correctly listed as such!Edit: Glad they finally updated their picture to reflect what was really being shipped."
4,"""Sunshine came softly thru my window today...""","I prefer the second, smoother versions of ""Colours"" and ""Catch The Wind"" over these folkie originals(done in the day when Donovan was seen as a Bob Dylan wanna-be), but you can't go wrong with Donovan when you're into a groovy mode. ""Jennifer Juniper"" is the musical equivalent of a lazy summer day, a field covered in daisies; ""Sunshine Superman"" is tangled web, forceful and poetic; ""Mellow Yellow"", with its old-fashioned pomp, is like a wonderful ""Yellow Submarine"" outtake. Of the bonus tracks, ""To Susan on The West Coast Waiting"" is the most intriguing. Best hidden gem: ""Lalena"", with its beautifully sad, ironic prose. An amazing body of work."
3,Title,"Jewell box arrived broken.---16 more words. This feedback mechanism is a joke, not user friendly at all. - - -"
1,"""Greatest"" hits?","Of the big-selling acts of the 1960's, Donovan was...words fail me...the most slight.He was The Monkees without the TV show. Every horrid album he made was absolutely cynical and calculating, from his early Dylan-aping (""Catch the Wind"" was Dylan's ""Chimes of Freedom"" with all the thought, weight, and poetry liposuctioned out) through his ""Psychedelic period"" (""Mellow Yellow"" was Sgt. Pepper after he'd been busted down to private), to his late-sixties slide into psuedo-hippy mysticism.Every thing he did showed his, uh, ""creative"" process, which went something like this: listen to the latest thing, attach yourself leech-like to the trend, and exploit it with passable approximations of the ""new sound"", which is the reason that all of his output sounds extremely dated now."
2,"Greatest Hits, Yes, But Not the Original Album","I grew up listening to this the LP of ""Donovan's Greatest Hits"", and I love it. However, THIS IS NOT THAT ALBUM. The LP release of ""Greatest Hits"" featured re-recordings of ""Catch the Wind"" and ""Colours"" that were in step with Donovan's late 60's sound, and flowed better (in terms of ambience and sound quality) with the rest of the songs on the album. This CD features the original, folkier versions of those songs and it totally DESTROYS the flow and overall mood of the album. I do appreciate having the original, folkier versions of ""Catch the Wind"" and ""Colours"" but I would have MUCH preferred to keep the flow of the original album. Why couldn't they have tacked the original versions on as bonus tracks??? I'd still like to have the re-recorded versions that I am more familiar with on a remastered CD."
5,Donovan/CD,You just can't beat the old ones. CD came in excellent condition and was fast!!Roxann HillGecko Girl
4,Quick Books Pro 2005 Review- Tony,"Excellent tool for small business. Takes a while to get the correct use of it, particularly what accounts to use if you do not have an accounting background. The quick tours are vey helpful. The number of transactions that have to be carried out are a little tedious, but so it's keeping accounting books."
2,Be prepared to part with a lot of money!,"Don't run your business with this software if you are careful with your money - as most small businesspeople are.Every few years you have to upgrade in order to maintain the ridiculously expensive payroll tax update. I wish I had never upgraded from the early 1990's version.You used to be able to manually enter the federal and state withholding infomation in the earlier versions, which makes sense for a very small business like ours. But you can't do that anymore. In order to even OPEN the payroll window, you MUST subscribe to the payroll update service! I seem to recall that it's almost $200 per year now, and increases annually!It is now May, 2005, and I just received a notice that Intuit will no longer be providing tax tables for the 2003 version. I dread opening mail from Quickbooks, because notices like this are not uncommon.I am looking for a different software program for 2006."
3,pos needs improvements,"Just started a small business. I had Quickbboks already so I went with Point of Sale for the retail benefits. POS needs improvement on charge accounts. When you enter a purchase and supply it to an in house charge account you have to total reenter it to apply the payment, and reserve the first sale, it makes it look like a return. It is costly, you get technical support free for 30 days, after that you have to pay $299. for one year. I started out with 1499. invested and I have had to spend additional $400, for an upgrade and $899 for another quickbooks pro to work with two computers. Wish I had invested in Peachtree instead. It's more friendly and less complicated.and the integrating with the Quickbooks is not defined well."
1,Quirky Product with horrible support,"Like many Intuit Products, this is full of bugs. High priced Customer support plans promise 10 minute max wait time. The wait time is never under 2 hours. The support personnel are off shore and ill equipped to deal with many questions. You can request a call back from an American Tech which is supposed to occur within 4 hours but too often never takes place."
2,No Customer Service Cost Us $$$,"Even when Intuit's customer service was located in the United States, I received conflicting information and instructions which caused our company to lose $214.35 with no refund in sight. One representative said we had to purchase another copy of the program in order to have an additional license. Then a different representative said this was incorrect and to send the copy back without opening it. I did this and they refunded the shipping. That's it. No one ever told me that Intuit does not refund extra license fees, they just kept taking my information and promising a refund. Then they changed their customer service to India who have no idea who these people were that I spoke with, but also promised a refund which never arrived. Warning---do not purchase an extra license just on their say-so."
1,What you get when there's no competition,"Nutshell: Intuit and a company called Best Software are the only two firms producing small-business accounting software. Because of this, they've split the market between them and are now engaging in monopolistic gouging. Each year, the price goes up. Each year, the service goes down. This will persist until an alternative appears. If you are considering making small-business accounting software, do it! You'll find lots of customers ready to switch. But back to Quickbooks: you have to upgrade every other year at a minimum - Intuit turns your software *off*. You have to buy a service contract to make it function - the list price above is NOT what you'll end up paying. So if you buy this, understand that you're entering an endless upgrade cycle with no way to escape, and a company that can turn off your software, remotely, at any time, with no refunds. Enjoy!"
4,Strange Lust Story,"Vicky's family goes on a cross-country camping trip. But what starts out as an innocent vacation turns Vicky's world upside down as two teen-age boys make it their priority to follow Vicky's family in a desperate attempt to win her affection. One is a smart, fun-loving boy who the entire family likes and who Vicky feels for. The other is a wild boy who's suffering with a fatal disease. But this boy, who is wild and trying to prove his lack of fear of death, gets Vicky's attentions and, in some parts, her sanity as she tries to keep up with him. But I'm not gonna tell you who she chooses."
1,"Most disappointing Patton album, sadly ...","I have followed Patton works since the beginning. FNM, Mr Bungle, Fantomas, Tomahawk, John Zorn, just to name a few... But this cd with Kaada (?) is one of the most boring and out of interest creation I have ever heard. Sounds like people who never done music before and try to make something different. A real joke. The packaging is nice though... But Mike Patton is a guy who can really surprise you, on a positive manner everytime but this time, on a very negative one. What's the point ????"
4,Jim Morrison fans,"Just like Morrison exposed his bottom to the public in concert; so can you show off Jim Morrison on your bottom! All I can say is these thong undies with the classic face of the famed leader of the Doors made my teenage daughter very, very happy! She wants to frame them!!"
3,Bonjour Les Amis: Vol. 1,"My daughter is starting French Immersion School in the Fall, so we wanted to get a variety of media to help our family learn a little French this summer. Bonjour Les Amis is a good video for this purpose. It is not the most cutting edge in animation, but is interesting enough to hold all of our attention and give us a foundation in French. We have not been able to find many other kid-oriented french language tutorial-focussed videos.We have been able to listen to the articulation of words and simulate them. The repetition is done in a way to help solidify words in our memory without becoming boring. I would recommend this video to others looking for some introduction to French."
3,Extras are the best,"I was, frankly, disappointed in this DVD, not because of any lack of quality in the dancing or production. Rather, it was too good for my taste. Both the dancing and the staging were spare, sophisticated and modern, and I wanted colorful, traditional and colloquial. The lighting was dramatic and the singing was quite good; but for me, the best part was not the stage show, but the ""Madrid's Night"" extra showing members of the company with friends and family improvising on a patio in miscellaneous casual clothes running heavily to jeans. This had, for me, more of the spirit I was looking for--and I couldn't disagree with the star's mother that little Arabia (Sara's daughter?) was the star of that show."
4,Great historical fiction!,"I was pleasantly surprised with the depth of history provided in this new series. I have read other books by this author and believe this was the most in-depth fiction book I've encountered by him, so far. I look forward to the next installments of this series. The book follows the viewpoint of 4 families during the years leading up to the Civil War: A Northern family with no slaves, a plantation Southern family that mistreats their slaves, a forward-thinking Southern family who frees their slaves, and a runaway slave family. These families intertwine to give a wide spectrum to the stories within the series."
5,My husband has been a California surfer since 1968.....,"I just purchased this DVD ""Endless Summer"" for a Father's Day gift for my husband. I honestly don't know what took me so long to buy it for him. This is the ""1"" surf film that causes his eyes to actually sparkle when he talks about it. And for anyone who has a surfer in their life who might be on the fence about which surf flick to purchase, I highly recommend this be the first. Even after watching this movie over and over since it first came out, it bring's on an excitement in my husband like a child on a carnival ride. I also purchased ""Singlefin Yellow"" and I'm hoping what I read in review's proves true."
5,The Endless Summer Collection,This is truly one of the best surf movie/documentary you will ever see. This is the most amazing footage take to date about what true surfing is all about. I can't believe this is over 40 years old. It is also quite funny in its narration. If you have never seen one of Bruce Brown's films this is by far the best of them all.
1,Not a true Gazetteer,A true Gazetteer list ALL the current and historical places in a state with information about each place. I refer you to the NORTH CAROLINA GAZATEER by Wm. S. Powell. This S. C. Atlas is a miss named map book!! I was VERY disappointed when I received it and sent it right back.
3,"Detailed, but not up-to-date","DeLorme's South Carolina Atlas & Gazetteer USED TO BE a great reference tool, but it has not been updated in quite a few years. The copyright notice may read ""2010"", but the maps are actually much older than that. For example, it does not show the Arthur Ravenel Bridge, which opened in 2005."
3,Didn 't find it user friendly,"I bought this Laboratory Manual, and the Workbook as well, as I began my first Italian class ever. I thought I could supplement my class time with these books. I have not been able to use them because the audio that supplied them was not easily available, took too much time to figure out - still haven't. If someone invested more time to figure out how to use them they might be useful. I love the Prego! textbook - but the two supporting books just were not as great for me."
5,Quality and Comfort,"No slippage, Great Fit, Awesome Feel and Look :)P.S. price is great-these run about $75 on up in stores-same exact shoe. Buy them here:)"
1,Hangs crooked and keeps towels soggy forever!,This rack remains wobbly and hangs crooked even with towels on it. The towels are all too close to each other. Each towel has 4 layers of terry because you must fold the towels. They stay wet forever. I threw this away after trying to use it for a while.
4,Good Buy,This chair was easy to assemble and has worked out good. It is what I expected for the price. It is comfortable and rolls great on concrete floors!
3,Not quite wrong directions,"The chair was fairly easy to assemble. The directions that are included are for the basic office chair. The extension bar that allows it to be a high rise chair, does come with directions. They are printed on the box of the extension parts.We did find the screws difficult to remove from the base of the seat. Make sure you have a good screwdriver."
2,Not the best,"I'm not very pleased with this chair. Assembly was easy, but the chair leans a little to the left. Which is more than slightly obnoxious after a while. It is also relatively impossible to take apart after you have assembled it."
1,Title wrong - NOT Canon,I thought from the title the cartridge was remanufactured by Canon. NOT. It's an after-market refill with non-Canon toner. Glad I read the description and before buying. Don't be fooled by the title
5,Excellent blade,Freud is a very good blade. This was a fair price. Fast arrival Very good buy! Saw blde is very sharp and the design make it cut through oak like a knife through hot butter.
5,Great new sound and really versatile CD!,"I've been hearing ""Let's Make a Deal"" on the radio and bought the cd. I can't believe there are only 2 (cute!) guys in this band. Their sound is really fresh, and the songs on the cd are all different. I can't decide which is my favorite."
2,Simply Forgettable,"Boring, boring, boring, boring, boring. That's it. I can't remember anything about this book aside from finding it a waste of money and time."
3,"It's OK, but not unforgettable","This was my first read by this author and I thought it was a quick and adequately entertaining read. I will read some of her more highly rated books next time or at least check the reviews first.There is really not too much to say about the story. I was bothered by the fact that Frances had such a modern attitude - independent career girl, dedicated to job, excels at opera singing and cooking on the side. Her character/personality didn't fit in with the period or the setting."
4,Simply Unforgettable,"This was a book with good humor, wit, and good writing. I enjoyed reading it and wondering what would happen next."
3,Alittle disapointed,"The first movie was so good, and now this. Poltergeist 2 was officialy one of the WORST films I have ever seen. I nearly cried, not because it was scary, but because I had officialy wasted 2 hours of my life.Now, Poltergeist 3 I LOVED. If they had made this teh second one, it would have been pefect. Oh, and it's so sad (and kinda creepy) how Heather died right before the films release."
2,Holy Blunder Batman!,"My son loves everything batman. He even calls himself batman, so when his 3rd birthday came, we thought the perfect gift would be this utility belt. How wrong we were! The belt won't fit around his waist. We stuck a folded hand towel in the back to keep it up. The pellet foam gun, which turned out to be his favorite part, broke within 1 hour of play. He now won't wear the belt. He does however still play with the flashlight that came with it. Thankfully, I was more disappointed than he was."
1,Buyer beware,"I loved my Naturally Speaking ver 4, when it was owned by Dragon Systems. Now, apparently, Scansoft has taken it over. I haven't yet been able to upgrade, because the program crashes before I can get it going. There is NO free technical support available other than canned ""Knowledge Base"" and FAQ and a user forum. If I want to ask Scansoft why my program won't install properly, I can pay...for an email question to that effect. The Knowledge Base does say that you CANNOT preserve your old speech files when upgrading from ver 4 to 6 or 7. So if you have accumulated a few years worth of training and specialized vocabulary, as I have, you'll lose it all. (Oh yes, you can use a convoluted process to export all that vocab from ver 4, import it into ver 6 or 7, then train all the words again, but of course not in context etc.) Scansoft -- get lost!"
1,This books lacks Brazilian Portuguese.,This grammar is acceptable if your aim is to learn Continental Portuguese but I cannot reccomend it to anyone who wants to learn Brazilian Portuguese. Buy an excellent MODERN PORTUGUESE grammar written by one of the Brazil's most famous and trusted linguists: Mário Perini instead.
5,"You AIn't Got That Zing if You Ain't Got This ""Swing!!""","This project almost made me purchase every swing project ever recorded. Wynton and LCJO does the ""Duke"" very proud!!!"
4,Great insight to Western Desert warfare,"I enjoyed this thoroughly. The book is a rare viewpoint from a tank commander in the Desert in WWII. Really shows the confusion so much a part of any war, but particularly this campaign."
3,Good for my use,"I have had this computer for 5 years. I do like it a lot, however, I only use it for internet and writing papers. No gaming or watching movies. I believe it would move too slow if someone was using it for that. I had the CD-ROM break and got it replaced and the fan is very loud and I got it cleaned out and it still is pretty loud. The fan runs non-stop. It's annoying if I am trying to watch tv at the same time because it is so loud. For my use though, it has been a very good computer for me and I would buy another Sony Vaio in the future when I am ready for one. I plan on getting about another year out of this computer though."
3,It's ok - some modules would crash the program,I liked the idea that there were multiple languages to expose my child to. I thought that some of the games were a little difficult and some were very easy. My daughter did get bored easily and some of the modules would crash the program when we would click to open them.
4,My Ignorance,"Before I purchased this book, I did not know I knew so little about my religion and God. since I purchased it from Amazon I can hardly leave it out of my hands. Although I do not understand it, The chapter on ""The Blessed Trinity"" I shall read again and again until maybe it begins to make sense, I hope so, it is fascinating as is the whole book."
2,NOT the original soundtrack,"I purchased this CD for my sister, only to be disapointed when it arrived. This is not the soundtrack for the original 52 Fushigi Yugi episodes, I've never heard this music before."
2,Boring,"Indie pop is indie pop, and it has to be phenomenally good to rise above that. Seven Swans, by Surfjam Stevie, is a great indie pop record. There are others I could mention. This album tries really hard, but I can't remember any of the songs after playing it five times. I have enjoyed the kilowatt hours in the past, nothing against them at all, I just find this one to be entirely forgettable. Their Travels in Constants EP was pretty good. Track that one down instead."
3,"Side 1 is good, but Side 2 should EMBARRASS the band.","The Unforgiven II is a song very similar to the original Unforgiven only it sounds more Country and less haunting. If you're one of those Metallica fans that just want to hear Seek & Destroy 1,000 times in a row, skip this one. That said, this isn't a bad song. It is far easier to sing along with this song than the first. I don't think the recording is as polished here as on the original Unforgiven, however. It sounds more raw. That isn't a complaint, just an obsevation. I WILL complain about Side 2, though: This side should EMBARRASS Metallica. It is a weak live performance of an otherwise cool song--The Thing That Should Not Be. James's voice is so far off-the-mark that I can barely stand it. The recording is mud, too. Did Metallica approve this? Why?"
5,The Unforgiven,This is a beautiful song that amongst all childeren can relate to james also displays the melody he has in his voice that he does in nothing else matters this song though is about how james could never forgive his parents for the stuff they did this song is a master piece and also featured on the best album of all time The Black Album
3,too shor for the price,Saw this on HDNET and by far this transfer is much better than what the cable and satellite companies broadcast. The only problem is that it's about 30 min and I don't think it should be priced that much. The program itself is very informative if you are planning a trip to Greece.
4,good tv movie havent read book though yet,I havent read the book but would like to i saw the tv movie of it with natassja kinski(however u spell her name)it was really good and i would really like to read the book!!!!!
4,Another good Follet Read,"I have read several of Ken Follet's books and he has become one of my favorite authors. While this book is not on par with Eye of the Needle, or Pillars of the Earth it is a very enjoyable read. It has all the elements a good Follett book has which is a romance, some thrilling moments and characters you can't help but to feel for, root for and keep reading to see what happens. I definitely recommend this if you like any of Ken Follett's other books and if you like World War II espionage novels."
4,The Key to Rebecca,"The Key to Rebecca was the only book by Ken Follett that i did not have the chance to read, and I was not disappointed. The intrigue is gripping and the characters are engaging. I would recommend that book very highly."
2,The key to Rebecca,It was a waste of time. Although I really like Ken Follett's books this one was poorly written and I had trouble following the connection between the biblical Rebecca and the plot
3,Not Follett's best,"A take on WWII in north Afrika, with a glimpse into the spy world. Plot is a little jerky but holds interest."
4,"another good follett, one of the better","great story and character feel. i really couldn't put it dow it had everything i like in a book: suspense, a great story and in effect a few hours lolling around with my imagination and a great read."
1,A well-written child's story,The book starts well but the story develops so utterly unbelievable that I cannot imagine a grown-up to accept that events could take place this way (including the sexual scenes). The ending is miserable: it made me regret I spent my time reading the book.
4,The Key to Rebecca,This is just another example of the great literary skills of Ken Follett. He is a master at the delivering of suspense and intrigue.
1,fun only for a minute,"I brought this toy to my boy when he was about 7 months old. Back then he didn't even give it a look, he didn't like and didn't want to touch it. Then, all of a sudden, at age of 11 months old, he took this toy and played with it for a week of so. Right now he is 13 months old and he doesn't even want to look at this toy when i'm giving it to him. Waste of money!"
2,Not much fun for baby!,"I thought this toy looked like a lot of fun when I got it 8 months ago. My daughter, now 14 months old, never really played with it. I saw her shake it once, but that was it. I thought it was a lot more fun than she did."
1,Cute but boring!!,My daughter received two of these for Christmas two years ago. They are both sitting at the bottom of her toy box. She never liked this toy - it is very cute but just dosen't do much to spark a baby's interest. Hopefully my two month old will like it in a couple of months!!
1,Not a good toy!,"I got this toy for my son when he was 3-month old. I know it's a bit early, but I like to buy toys in advance... My son is 14-month old now, and the toy is still laying in a toy box. He was curious at first to see a new object, but the toy is way too heavy for any kid under a year; it is very hard to hear the giggling sound and only an adult can really shake it the way so it giggles. I have no idea who decided to give this toy it's name - ""Giggle Ball"".It looks great, but has no use. I had a lot of kids looking at it, but in less then a minute they loose an interest and never come back to it."
3,It's an ok toy,"It's nice and lightweight compared to the fishbowl, the nesting pails (very heavy for a baby), and the musical ball. It doesn't giggle much, but my son likes to play with it. He'll grab it and examine it turning it this way and that before shaking it. Soon after he likes to move on to something else, however. I think this toy could be improved by either making it less bulky and making it make more sounds."
1,Not an attention grabber,"My baby will play with just about anything (she's one today!). You name it, paper, washclothes, tupperware. This ball holds absolutely NO interest for her, she never even picks it up. I've tried, for months, to show her how it works, but still...no interest."
1,Still in the toy box,"My son has never even gave this toy a second look. I have even tried to pretend like I really liked it myself, but I was not really convincing considering that I, myself never wanted to pick it up again. It really seemed like he would like it when i bought it. It is really heavy for a baby and is really not meant to be picked up and played with roughly. It rolls and the baby is suppose to chase it, but my son never wanted to do anything but pick it up and drop it and like I said it is heavy. I really think that this is one on the many toys that can go into the Wasted money toy box."
2,Waste of money,I bought this toy for my son when he was 7 months old. He played with it for a few minutes and now doesn't give it a glance. It doesn't giggle the way it is supposed to either. Even I have to shake it pretty hard to get any noise out of it. Overall....A WASTE of MONEY!
3,Got replaced by the Stars and Symphony ball,"My twin girls liked this up until someone gave us the stars and symphony ball. This is really more of a rattle as it does not roll well. As a rattle, it works well hooked into one of the play gyms. I think my girls are just spoiled not because they expect it to do something with lights and sounds like so many of their other toys."
4,"cuts well, but be sure to check the blade thickness","This blade cuts well, but I ran into a problem with it. I have a Porter Cable Saw Boss, as do many other reviewers of this product. When I first mounted the blade, it wobbled while it was on the arbor even though the flange was tightened as tight as possible. I noticed that the original blade that I was replacing is 0.053"" thick, by my measurements. This is the blade thickness, not the kerf width. The Diablo is 0.040"" thick, again by my measurements. This difference in thickness was enough on my saw to prevent the flange from pressing up against the blade when the bolt is tightened, causing the blade to wobble. I fixed the problem by buying a 0.5"" x 0.875"" x 18 gauge machine bushing at the local hardware store, and putting it between the flange and the bolt. This fixed the wobble and the blade cuts well. This problem may be particular to my individual Saw Boss, as I am surprised that no other Saw Boss owners mentioned this problem."
2,never heard it but,"this cd is basically compromised of songs from the first album, with one song from chicago II, 25 or 6 to 4. Overall, some good classic songs, like Beginnings and 26or624. I give two stars basically for these two songs."
3,won't stay up,"Well built and attractive, but be prepared to watch it slowly (if empty) or quickly (with music on it) drift completely down. No amount of pulling, twisting,or tightning will keep this stand up. Be prepared to find some kind of clamp to prevent drift."
4,Safe Car Traveling with Pet,"If your pet is traveling in the back seat, then the Mini-Connector attaches to a latch bar that is now required (standard) equipment on 2003 and newer vehicles. However, if you have an older vehicle, then you'll need to use the Seat Belt Adapter, which is best used on a 'lap belt only' seat belt, along with the PetBuckle Kwik-Connect Tether.And when your pet travels in the cargo area of your vehicle (because people are sitting in the back seat), then you'll need to loop the Seat Belt Adapter around the cargo area tie-down and attach the PetBuckle Kwik-Connect Tether to that."
4,Good for pet safety,"The tether is easy to snap on both the dog harness and the child seat anchor which is common in the back seat of most cars. My only complaint is that it is about 6"" too short. As a result, I would not recommend it for a dog larger than 40 pounds, especially if the dog has long legs like our dog does. (She cannot comfortably stand up with the tether attached to the back of her harness. That may be safer but not comfortable for her.)"
5,very pleased,This was exactly what I needed for foundation paper piecing. The lip on the bottom makes my cuts perfect every time.
4,A Great Book for Baseball Fans,"I read this book in college and it inspired me to try and see every major league ballpark during my lifetime. I am very excited to have bought it from Amazon and added it to my library. The rating system will appeal to both the diehard and casual baseball fan. I especially like his ranking of the concessions and highlighting any unique or local foods that are served. Although this book is out of print and somewhat outdated as new parks start to replace the classics, it is still a good addition to any baseball fan's collection.(...)"
3,"Good story, weak execution.","Overall I enjoyed this book, I just felt sort of lost as to what was going on. Especially with all the dukes and whatnot. Jaymes is a character I never grew to like or actually care for. A little too much convenient magic in this book and way too much teleporting. Plus characters seemed to move armies all around the land as if water. I'll continue the series."
5,The Good Book,"Of all manuals ever written, here is the pinnacle. Pay the price and buy the best. When in the trenches, its best to have the best."
5,"Smooth, fast, and quiet!","Have only used it for a few cuts so far, but it has been a joy to work with. I was really surprised at how much less dust it puts out than the stock blade, and how smoothly it glides through the wood. I am sold!"
4,WELL WORTH THE MONEY,"this is a single for turn the page but if you're like me and you're searching here for singles, it's not because you need the studio versions. it's because you want the live tracks. bleeding me is an excellent song, probably my favorite off of load and this is the best version of stone cold crazy i have heard because the crowd is really into it. the wait could be better but it's a good song. overall, it's definitely worth the cash. my friend bought if for me and now i love her about ten times more."
2,3 kittens... or 7 kittens?,"My one year old likes to look at the pictures in this book. It is good for teaching the names of the highlighted objects, but not for numbers. For each number, there are more objects that your little one can see on the opposite page. For example, ""four soft blocks"" means 4 blocks on that page, plus the three that the little boy in the picture is holding, plus the four on the right tab... 11 total! Babies of this age don't know they're only supposed to count the blocks on the left page. There should only be four objects visible at any given time."
3,I wasn't as lucky.,"I saw all the reviews and in search of something with less blades and a better price tag, bought this one. The cost compared to a lot of newer razor handles and ""high performance disposables"" these days is a big plus. With an 8-pack costing less than a dollar per cartridge at some sites, you can't go wrong.When it came down to the SHAVE, my reaction was not as favorable as was with the value. I'm very careful because I have sensitive skin with coarse hair prone to in-growns. I did my usual prepping and shaving. Unfortunately, I noticed that my legs were irritated after the shave. The shave gel left my legs soft as usual but the blade left them covered in small red irritated bumps (I didn't shave very hard so this was a surprise), and not a clean shave on either. I was pretty disappointed and will probably just let my sister have it so she quits using my regular shaver. Results may vary from person to person though. This is just my experience."
3,Informative Bio Of Lady Jane Grey,"I downloaded the E-book to my Kindle Fire. It is a very interesting biography originally published in 1855. I kept that in mind while reading, comparing this author's perspective to more modern biographies. There are striking differences that the reader should experience for themself. The portrayal of Henry VIII is especially harsh.The HUGE issue I have with the Kindle edition of the book are the hundreds, perhaps thousands of typographical errors. Nearly every page has several and it's frustrating (but not impossible) to figure out what the word(s) should be.That being said, I would recommend this book for those interested in Tudor history."
1,garbage :( 5$ wasted.,Watch band is just junk. the strap that secures a watch was sewn in crooked and the hole that would determine the watch size was so close to the first hole only a watch .5 inches long would fit :( just poor POOR quality.
2,slanted sides??,"Okay, so it's Anchor Hocking...made in the USA forever. You don't have to worry about any impurities, etc, as you might if it were made, say, in China.BUT! the top dimensions may be 9x5, but the bottom is 7x4! I feel this could seriously affect a yeast bread, which is my reason for this purchase.The picture shows a straight sided loaf pan. Oddly enough, the picture that comes attached to these pans shows a straight sided loaf pan.I'm afraid I'll have to return these in favor of Pyrex, or perhaps stoneware. Such a shame. Two stars for good construction and Anchor Hocking, but the dimensions make these ineligible for me.Maybe Amazon should correct their picture (or Kitchen Supply?) so people will know about this in advance and have a chance to make an informed decision."
1,Model LP-R400,"Model LP-R400, multi music player/CD recorder: The highest setting of volume is still barely acceptable (too low) for a CD, and completely unacceptable (way too low) for plastic record. When I called the company, the hours are 8-5, they say - leave a message, but then you cannot leave any message because the system malfunctions."
5,A superb comic ballet of martial arts.,"I have long been a fan of Angela Mao, but her grace, artistry and skill in this film is breathtaking. The film itself is a lighthearted delight. A few of the subtitles were hard to read, and a dubbed version would have been perferable so that your eyes would never have to leave the action. This is still a wonderful film."
1,I'll play the old while you sing me the new.,"Believe it or not, this was Orson Welles' first recorded musical performance. ""I Know What It Is To Be Young"" is a violin-drenched, minor-key, Charles Aznavour-ish ballad in which the weepy Ray Charles Singers gush that their lives have been changed forever by the words of an old man (Welles), who then rumblingly recites his mystical wisdom. This includes the following: young people don't think about age as much as old people do...young and old people should get together more often..and winter follows summer. Wow! This is an insipid performance that will turn your stomach. And the ""b-side"", which doesn't feature Welles, is even worse! This is a must-get for fans of bad celebrity recordings."
1,Orson gives William Shatner a run for his money... Cute!,"I'm not sure whether this 4-minute song was recorded as a joke, but it's certainly ridiculous. The liner notes champion ""a recording you'll play again and again. An inspired performance ...you'll want to share with friends and family.""Whatever. The orchestral backing is the kind of Rodeo Drive strings you found on your grandma's LPs (the ones she kept in the basement). Welles never sings, but he does pontificate with deadly force, propelling this junk into a camp classic. There's no Orson on Track 2, just a Perry Como-esque instrumental. Too much money for just 8 minutes, but I loved every horrible minute of it. If you loved William Shatner's ludicrous ""Transformed Man"" LP, check this out. Hmmm, maybe it IS a record you'll want to share with friends and family...."
2,Hated It,"I love Sarah McCarty books. Love, love, love her historical western novels. Was so looking forward to this contempary novel and was so disappointed. I just couldn't get into the story, didn't particularly like the main characters. Over all me just no likey."
3,hot but I hate that sharing thing,"I really enjoyed this author's ebooks of the promise's trilogy but this book while the premise is good, young woman held from living life to the fullest due to parental illness wants to experiment sexually, but when they start having extra people participating in the action that is just too much. It was a really good book from erotica standpoint but I don't like threesomes and that spoiled this book for me"
5,Hot Hot Hot!,"I loved this book...it was even better than the Promises series. Contrary to what one of the previous reviewers mentioned, I especially loved the last scene with the heroine, Zach and Mac. I thought it was unbeleivable erotic...this is after all an erotic romance, and I love a steamy menage scene in mine!"
3,Beater Hazard,"I purchased the Little Tikes Bake Set from Toys R' Us. All the accessories are good except the mixer. The beaters pull off the mixer w/ out much effort. Our little girl likes to chew on the beaters and if she would walk or run the ends are not as smooth as the above summary regarding the product claims. This needs to be brought to the attention of Little Tikes, which I will be calling next!!! I have also tried placing the beater in my mouth, with little pressure it doesn't feel good, let alone get the end of the beater in an eye."
3,I'll take the Gameboy version,"I bought this because it IS Tetris. I've loved Tetris ever since I was exposed to it on my Gameboy that I got for my birthday in 1990. To this day, it's the only game that I play on that old, heavy, out-of-date Gameboy. This version was clean and colorful. I was drawn to it because it would allow me to play on my TV without pulling out the old Nintendo. I just wish that you had a score in this version! There are many new ways to play and even a story but the gameplay of the original surpasses that of Tetris Worlds. Get it if you're new to Tetris, don't get it if you're an old fan."
1,Misrepresented Product,"THIS IS NOT THE SWORD PICTUREDIt is NOT the gold versionThis is being offered by CutleryUSA, Bud K is the parent company and even though they have been made aware of the situation, they have not changed the photograph.I have had many dealings with Bud K in the past and I have NEVER had a problem with any of their orders or merchandise being misrepresented.This and another item they have for sale here are the rare exceptions. Beware, the gold edition is limited to 300 numbered pieces. This is NOT the gold edition, according to my recent conversation with customer support at Bud K.The other Item is a Kit Rae Sword with a damascus blade. It is called Anathos and the picture doesn't match either. I got two different replys on this one so no telling what it really is."
2,Don't Believe The Hype,"I received my software with much anticipation after reading the reviews. I needed a ""Before you get started"" version just to help explain the ""Getting Started"" section. I all wanted was images, the Italian and English translations, and a pronunciation guide. It's taking an in depth study just to learn how to effectively use the software. I am very disappointed."
3,Difficult to read but not impossible,"This book is difficult to read but not impossible. I've read other books on Soviet economic structure and production, but this one is fairly dry and boring. a good book if you can muscle through it and if you want to learn something. Don't expect to be entertained here unless you find central pluralism and skewed GDP interesting."
5,Cuts like a sharp blade through butter,"The devil take it, this Diablo blade is a workhorse. I used it on pre-finished (aka, ultra-hard coated) hardwood flooring first, and it didn't splinter or bog down. Went on to use it on a lot of rough lumber, performed excellently. Masonite, fine. Oak, dandy.Seriously, this blade is worth the expense. Are you seriously still using the blade that came with your saw? The one with about 15 teeth? For any finish carpentry, a blade like this is a must. I have been very happy with it."
5,Freud D1060X,"Works well w/ miter saw on trim. I was going to get 80 tooth, but pro said this would work well w/o burning material if feed rate was too fast. Works well on 3/8"" plywood too. As long as you clean blade ocassionally and wipe w/ wax, it seems to stay sharp for ever. Thin kelf might we better, but this seems have 0 defflection on longer cuts."
5,"Watch it all, but the season ender is a doozy!!!","The added tension of splitting the team and delving more into the ""private"" lives of the CSI's was great.BUY IT!!!"
5,useful,Would not paper piece without these. Great to have both lengths and the 1/8th inch variation for when working with tiny pieces. Makes paper piecing much more enjoyable as it's easier to line up the next piece and your blocks do not end up so lumpy.
1,Worst Shaver I have ever owned.,"Unfortunately, this is the absolutel worst shaver I have ever owned and operated. I have been cutting my own hair for about 10 years, and have been through several shavers, including Wahl products, but this is the worst. Ironically, it is the most I have paid for one before. This shaver vibrates uncontrollably while you are trying to use it, the only question is whether your hand goes numb first or you cut your head numerous times. The only good thing about it is that it does get a close shave; however, at the expense of feeling like your hair is being plucked from your head and scraping your head. I am a Marine so I have been shaving my head for years, so this was not a matter of just never shaving before; the product was a complete disappointment, and if I were not in Iraq I would take steps to try to get a refund but it is too inconvenient at this point."
4,So far so good,I've been using this for only a few weeks but I'm happy so far. Clean cuts without a lot of complication.
4,Good buy,Does all you need for that person that just needs a trim without that expert signature of a barber. Definitely for home use.
4,The Great Wahl of China,"What can you say. Its a Wahl. Does anyone else make hairclippers?Why waste there time. They work great our of the box and when you need to sharpen them, it is cheaper to just buy a new set."
4,"Well made, large and heavy.","Surprise, surprise! ""Made in the USA""! Full compliment of attachment accessories, quite sturdy, appears that it'll last forever. This is the first electronic / electrical product I've bought in YEARS that didn't come from China. Five stars if a little less heavy and large."
5,Sandra Bullock shines,"a clever and funny script, loveable characters, and the wonderful screen presence of Sandra Bullock make this little film a must...true, Hollywood has taken beauty pageant films to the max, but this is the only good one out there from all their recent efforts...lacking the crude humor of Drop Dead Gorgeous, this one goes for plain good-old fashioned laughs, and delievers many...it sucks you into the plot and delivers loads of fun for two hours...a crowd pleaser if there ever was one, Bullock deserves an Oscar Nomination for this one..."
3,Simply Irresistible,"Okay, this isn't a sophisticated Billy Wilder bon bon, nor is it an out-and-out hilarious, outrageous classic, like ""Blazing Saddles"" or ""Airplane!"" But ""Miss Congeniality"" is a keeper, almost in spite of itself. Some of the jokes are stinkers and clinkers, and the spoofing of beauty pageants could have been far sharper. (This is strictly a spoof, not satire.) But Bullock and Co. are delightful throughout, and there are enough priceless moments to keep the smile on your face from start to finish. A genial comedy that I'll be popping into the DVD in future, whenever I need a little harmless (albeit toothless) cheering up."
2,Another Sandra movie,"This(In my opinion) it's the worst film that Snadra ever acted in.It's stupid, boring, and nothing original.In the same categorie than Drop dead gorgeous, this film tells the story about the looking like a lesbian cop, Gracie Heart.A mad man is going to attack in the Miss Unite States contest, so Gracie it's the only one than can help, by entering at the contest.She's very ugly, so they re-make her like Pretty woman o Princess diaries style.And now Sandra loosk like...WOW!But that, i'm afraid to say it's what the director calls PLOT.Better luck next time for him! But i didn't enjoy this film at all.I know a lot of you film lovers liked this one, but ther was something mising here for me, may be creativity.Just wanting for Sandra's next fil a little upset."
4,This one's good fun!,"Sandra Bullock plays a tomboy FBI agent who is somewhat lacking in social graces. When an undercover officer is needed to investigate potential mayhem at a beauty pageant, she is chosen. Michael Caine, as a beauty pageant coach, is charged with the job of converting her to a believable contestant. He coaches her speech, and her walk and employs a team of beauty experts to complete the conversion. During the pageant, she slips into her old persona just often enough to be funny. Candace Bergen is a former beauty queen who currently runs the pageant and is angry because her bosses are threatening to fire her. When you want a chuckle, rent this one."
2,"Not at all good, but it has it's moments","This movie's pretty bad and all, but every once in a while, someone will say or do something that's really funny. And while most people are driven to the brink of insanity by William Shatner's ""singing,"" I find it amusing. Bullock's likable, as usual. Bratt isn't really but kinda, also pretty standard. Totally ridiculous, implausible, and old-hat, but not unbearable to watch on a slow night."
2,Eh.,"A few cute moments, but nothing stand-alone in the movie. Basic plot, no surprises.Not bad for a chick flick--but it _is_ a chick flick.Worth a rental, not a purchase."
5,Great triple square set!,"I have a 2007 Vw gti. Tons of triple squares! This kit has helped me remove swaybars, streering wheel etc. Thus far they have held up great. The several times I've needed a triple square this small kit always has the right size!"
4,a life saver!,"After deciding to take the dog on our family vaycay, we realized we needed help with space! The Thule 866 Escape was easy to install and held a LOT of our stuff. We spotted many of them on the road and will never go on a trip without it again!"
3,SOUL OF R&B-MTV UNPLUGGED,THIS DVD IS A NICE FLASHBACK OF THE EARLY 90'S IT HAS GREAT PROFORMANCES FROM SOME TALENTED ARTIST.
4,Exosquad Season 1,"This video shows well even though it is not bluray. Hopefully, Universal will put out season 2. It is worth the purchase."
3,Not as good as I thought,"ExoSquad looks good on paper, but the animation style and character design was not up to par with Batman TAS or Gargoyles. I like the story so I'll have to watch a couple more episodes before I render final judgement."
5,Exosquad: Season 1,"Wow I remember watching this series after school. So this is how it started though, I came in in the middle and we moved around alot. I wasnt able to keep up with it usually what with different channels in different areas so sadly I misssed alot of it. I wonder if they will ever release the rest of the seasons because I never got to see the ending, or well most of the series to be honest, either. It was one of the rare shows that actually had a pretty serious story and wasnt just some flashing images that had no point except to, I dont know, draw the eye across the screen for no discernable reason except to say ""HEY! Look at me, Im Flashing! Arent I pretty!?"". Ah well good times.Take care everyone, Cyn"
5,so cute to watch,this is an older movie that my kids and grandkids love to watch..love the way that Stuart looks so real and the way he and the cats mouths move when they talk..my 3yr old gd. loves it..and so do I..
1,DVD Problems,I too have a problem playing Stuart Little 2 on my Harmon Kardon DVD-50. I rented this movie from Blockbuster and thought it was a defective DVD. Then I received the movie as a gift for Christmas and the same thing happened! Based on the previous review I guess Sony doesn't really care.
5,best stuartlitle in town,"i think that he very cute and lovable,he wanted be part of little family,he just wanted be someone and not just a mouse"
1,DVD-ROM DOES NOT WORK!,"Me and my dad got this movie from the library. I finished watching the movie and the bonus features. I went to DVD-ROM. What happens? DVD-ROM DOES NOT WORK! I tried my DVD Player. DOES NOT WORK! Tried my family's computer. DOES NOT WORK! The DVD worked fine. When i looked on the back of the DVD, i found out that it was made in 2002. Revoice Studio for Stuart Little was also made in 2002. I also found out that it does not work on Windows 7.Mikaela ArsenaultSalem,NH"
2,Lacks the magic of the first film,"I found this sequel to be lacking in warmth, imagination, and unable to envolve either myself or my wife as we watched it, unlike the original. Rent it first and be sure you like it enough to buy it. I didn't."
1,Poor fit and uncomfortable - save your money!,"First of all, the size chart is way off. I ordered size 9(men's)/10(women's) for my husband, who wears size 9, but he could not even put them on. I tried the slippers myself (I wear women's size 9) and, even though there was still some space for probably half a size length-wise, they were way too narrow even for me.Both upper and sole material is very tough, unflexible and as ""comfy"" as cardboard. I could not walk in these slippers, only drag or slide my feet. Inside wasn't as soft as in my LL Bean sheepskin slippers.On top of that I had to pay to return this item to Amazon (there is no ""does not fit"" return reason)."
2,Do not buy it,"This product was great until it started freezing all the time, even during recording. All this in less than one month after purchase."
3,well done comedy,Good British 60's sleeper. After a soccer game a 39 year old virgin goes to a bar with some work buddies. While there his friends make a bet about him taking a blonde (Diane Cilento) home. She overhears this and decides to go against the wager. She takes the shy guy to her apartment and entertains with lies about a past wealthy lifestyle. He's naive enough to believe them. You route for them to get together.The movie is affectionate towards its lead characters. You can tell it was based on a play by its chatty nature but it makes good use of the London background. Cilento guves a sexy energetic performance here. She's a discovery. I will be looking into her.
3,which version,"There are several more accurate compilations. Why would a 'greatest hits' album substitute the album version, over the original (usually unique) single version? That's like that Beatles greatest hits album with the slow version of 'Revolution' from the white album. I guess it's alright for a casual fan, but not really accurate."
3,song book,Great Book for what it is. A lot of songs to chose from alot I never heard of but enough to make book worth purchase.
5,Extremely useful,"Reading the above reviews I wasn't sure about the book but I bought it anyway. Iwould have to say that it certainly has many hymns I am familiar with and covers the ""Living Hymns"" hymnal we use in the Baptist church I go to fairly well. I gather if you are Anglican or Uniting your milage may vary significantly so check out the index first.The book is easy to use and well laid out. Chords are very good and have had no difficulty transposing them to the same key as the organist plays and playing along (this is not always as straigforward as it sounds as some of the chords you get off the free sites just don't sit well with someone playing from the music).If you recognise a reasonable number of the hymns from the contents page then buy it you won't be dissapointed. If you don't recognise most of the hymns then this is probably not what you are looking for."
1,What a waste of money...,"Just until today, this product had been wonderful. Actually, I just deleted my old five-star review in order to write this one instead.What happened? well, basically it got stuck. It wouldn't spin anymore for no apparent reason and I couldn't get my CD/DVDs out. Nice...This wasn't the first time it got stuck but all the previous times the culprit was a CD halfway in through the opening.But today there was nothing preventing the unit from rotating yet it won't spin. It will only make some awful noise. I tried shaking it a little bit, still no luck.In the end I had to disassemble the unit getting several of my CD/DVDs scratched in the process and two of my fingers hurt.I regret having wasted my money and time with this product. Stay away from it for your own good."
1,Disk Carousel,"I had purchased serval of these units after reading some reviews on them. If you loaded them to their advertised limit all units eventually stopped operating. They just did not have enough power to rotate the drum. Also all were very slow to locate the disk. You might say you are not in a hurry, OK then go get a cup of coffee and maybe it will find the disk by then. Again this is only if you only fill the unit about half way. Sent them all back for a refund. Very disappointed."
2,THE THING STARTED SMOKING,"AT FIRST I THOUGHT THIS ORGANIZER IS PERFECT FOR WHAT I NEED. THEN AS I BEGAN TO LOAD DISC AFTER DISC IT BEGAN TO HANG-UP AND NOT LET ME PUT MORE IN IT WITHOUT GETTING ERRORS. AS I BEGAN TO CHECK OUT THE PROBLEM DISC AND REINSTALL IT, IT HUNG-UP AGAIN AND BEGIN TO SMOKE IN THE BACK."
4,Good times,"I bought four of these recently and have them stacked. They work well, and the included software is usable (works fine on Windows 7 64-bit). In fact, it makes batch adding discs pretty fast. I've got ~150 DVDs loaded and I imagine it took me about two hours.Pros: Cheap (I paid $29/each), stackable for great expandability (up to ten for a total of 1,000 discs), looks decent, fast roboticsCons: Absurdly bad stacking design (six small metal pins that you must align without seeing them, easy to bend), I'm unclear if the manufacturer still supports it.Bottom-line: If they last for a reasonable amount of time, I'll be a happy camper."
2,Owning a Shih Tzu,"I never received this one but, had to provide a rating because I couldn't leave this page otherwise."
5,It's Gabby,"I've always loved this recording. Friend sent it to me when it first came out in the early seventies. I think, however, it has gained in importance since then.But I'd also like to see the two older Hula Records' Gabby Pahinui with the Sons of Hawaii reissued in their entirety. Also the Dave Guard recording, some of which have come out on one or another collection as well. They came out in the early 60's, possibly the late 50's."
4,Deals with a lot of countries and places,"Very good in dealing with so many places and activities. But, I was faxing one hostel in Paris, The Three Ducks, and the rate per night has increased from 97FF (Lets Go Europe and the Internet) to 127FF. That's a very big increase from one year to the next. They said that it's the same price with or without breakfast. Can hostels raise their prices by so much and so abruptly?Otherwise, I'm finding the book very helpful to plan my trip to Europe at the end of July."
2,Let's Go get a second opinion.,"When I was in Europe over Christmas '97, I traveled almost entirely with Rick Steves, whom I highly recommend. But one of my friends had a Let's Go, and so we combined forces.After this experience, I have a few things to say about Let's Go. On the positive side, everything is cheap. However, often times it isn't only cheap in price but in quality. Because it is so popular, the hostels tend to fill up fast. Also, the directions are foggy at best and the information is not always accurate.In short, if you are going to Europe alone, don't let this be your only guide. You will wind up in trouble, and your guide book won't help you out of it. Go with Lonely Planet or Rick Steves--much more helpful in tight circumstances, and 98% accurate. If you're traveling with friends, take along a Let's Go because of the prices, but go to the last hostel listed first so you have a place to stay, and make sure you have a complimentary book with you."
2,boring,"I have no right to judge this book, i only read the first chapter, good read right before bed, makes you tired."
4,Social Problems,still using it for class it is informative and useful hits on all of the problems that are being addressed in our class discussions
3,"good, didnt come in 2 days tho","Great Condition, no problems besides i payed extra for it to get here in 2 days because classes had already started and it took longer than 2 buisness days."
1,A fine example of overproduction,"I listened to some of the songs with an open mind, and I couldn't take much more of the ""I'm so gawff woe is me!"" attitude. I don't see originality here. It's just another fine example of an over-produced album designed for neo-goths to purchase with glee in order to make a few people rich.I can only see this as a ploy. It's the sex-appeal gimmick, ""buy my album because I'm so hawtt"" like HIM uses. Sariah is rather attractive to me, but I'm not about to buy an album for pretty pictures. I find her singing marginal too.In all honesty I have heard EBM that sounds more unique than this. :\"
3,Typical Tavener,"I am a Tavener fan, but this music, while good, does not rate 5 star. The first work on the CD is the best, as it has a soprano voice, sung with violin and tambura, and uses Indian modes. It's a great piece, but it's too long (at 25 minutes), and it endlessly repeats itself, so it becomes somewhat boring. The other two works on the CD are also a bit long and repetitious."
5,Realm of Algebra is book that makes math fascinating.,Isaac Asimov did a great job of telling the story behind the numbers. He explains the whys and the hows of math. Understand the creation of a formula. Don't just memorize formulas and steps. This book makes Algebra into a fun challange instead of a drudgery.
5,Great solution,"Our daughter was born with a ""high palate"" and the Stage 1 nipples from Dr. Brown's were flooding her mouth and she would cough and gag...I didn't want to use them, but needed to supplement her with formula. These preemie nipples saved the day! They were the perfect flow AND I was very concerned about nipple confusion since I was breastfeeding the majority of the time - no problems at all! She went from the bottle to the breast without missing a beat. VERY happy with this purchase!"
5,Riedel Wine Glass Travel Case,Smart looking case that properly holds and protects your fine stemware. Can hold 4 Vinum Bordeaux--great for a night out at your favorite BYOB.
3,This exercise bike does exactly what I was looking for....,"The seat is very uncomfortable, and there are no gears in case I might want to challenge myself.Going to put all that aside and try to get the best work out I can,,,,Here comes the Summer...."
1,Read that label - preservatives have changed,"I've been using Reviva products for years - until recently - when I noticed Sodium Benzoate is now among the ingredients. This is a known carcinogen that converts to Benzene in the presence of Ascorbic Acid (Vit. C), something that is also found in skin care products. I contacted the company and learned that, Yes, they changed the formulation but the preservatives represent a very small amount.The FDA has standards for the amount allowed in food and other products. Problem for me is ""in aggregate"" how much are people getting from all the products they are consuming and applying? (Soda & many other foods contain SB... And then there is the issue of combining such a skin care product with Sun exposure."
3,Welcome to Average-ville...,"Hmmm... I love the ""High & Mighty"", and whats more I love ""Eastern Conference Records"". I guess this is due to the fact that historically everything they have touched has been absolute gold. However, I'm not sure about ""Airforce 1"".Don't get me wrong... I don't hate it, but yet I would find it hard to say I love it. Every track on the album left me feeling that any minute something magic was going to happen, but then it never eventuated. The ""Dude Where's My Car?"" skit left me feeling nothing short of mortified for them. When I listen to ""Airforce 1"" I have to ask myself ""Am I missing something here?"" which is never a good sign.When comparing ""Airforce 1"" to ""Home Field Advantage"" it appears track production on the former could have been done by a 13yr old child with a Casio.Not bad, not great = average.Final score - An album for ""Eastern Conference Recordings"" Complete-ists only."
4,Air Force 1 cant crash,"It seems like nothin High N Mighty put out can be garbage. I really enjoyed the Eastern Conference All Stars Pt 2 compilation and when I heard about this I knew it would ill. I only heard bits and pieces of ""Home Field Advantage"" so seeing this was a 10 track EP kind of disappointed me at first. But its always quality over quantity so I checked it out. The first thing I noticed is that the production is on point as with anythin High N Mighty are associated with. And you know the lyrics are on point. With guest appearances by Copyrwrite, Havoc, Ra the rugged Man, and cAgE, this album is more than worth listening to. The only weak track on this album in my opinion is ""Illadel Jack Move."" This album deserves 4.5 stars and shows that Air Force 1 cannot crash."
3,SMall car,"This car came a lot smaller than I thought it would be. The picture is blown up I guess, but I didn't think I would be buying a matchbox size car for the price I paid. My son does enjoy the car and when you back it up it takes off."
3,No need to buy the book now,"Gee, Amazon. Thanks for the spoilers in your description of the book. Now I know that she gets to leave the island, that her husband dies in a fight, that she has to give up her child...why would I want to buy the book now??!!"
3,3.5 stars for new story,"new, fresh topic of addressing both hawaiian island history and leprosy. main character interesting at first, then became repetative in storyline until end, which was interesting again. would have liked little more history of molokai island woven into story."
5,"Historical, yet readable","Not going to tell you anything about the content of the book. I'm not here to show off my writing skills either. If you like historical fiction this book won't disappoint. I love history, Hawaii, and stories with strong female characters. It really amazed me that this story was written by a male, not that men can't write well-rounded female characters, but they don't always ""feel"" them well. I read this book and it stayed with me for years. I can still think about it and picture the story. I have a very short attention span and reading is slow for me. If a book gets boring, I put it down...I don't give it a chapter or even 2 pages. Not interesting, not going to read it. This book has heart and it is character driven. I would highly recommend this book. Great read. One of the best I have read in years!"
5,"Moloka'i, a book review","I enjoyed reading this book because it mixed enough facts with fiction to make it a tightly written, pleasant novel."
2,Not that Great,"I quit reading about half way through because I did not really care about what happened to any of the characters.The facts and history of leprosy were interesting, though."
5,Great read,This was recommended by a book club. It was hard to put the book down once I got started. Very thoughtful and interesting history I was not aware of --I give it the top rating.
3,Simplistic Writing,"We read this in our book club and except for discussing leprosy in general there was little to really ""discuss."" There is no exposition of Ideas in the book; a simple plot and not fully developed characters. Not worth the time."
4,Moloka'i,An intriguing and ever changing novel. Very nicely written with thought provoking insights. I would recommend this book to anyone who really likes a great read!
5,Moloka'i,"I absolutely LOVED this book. I had read a library edition and loved it so much that I had to have a copy for my own. I have several friends who are reading and enjoying the book as well. It takes you through all human emotions, and just when you thought things couldn't get worse, over several years things get resolved and there is a marvelous ending. I have read Honolulu, another of this author's books, and I loved it too. I may have been especially interested because I lived in Hawaii for three years.I might mention that I was thrilled to receive the book in only two days after ordering it from Amazon."
4,good story,"It was a good story over one girls sad life. I liked it but the book had a lot of sadness, good development of characters. I personally like a more upbeat story but I am glad I read it."
5,Moloka'i Book Review,This is an interesting story about the famous Hawaiian leper colony told from an inside point of view. I think that it wove truth and fiction together beautifully. If you are interested in Hawaiian culture you will be drawn into this story. There was also pretty eye opening information about Hansen's disease in this story.
2,Disappointing,"The further I got into this book, the more immature I thought the story-writing got. Although I enjoyed the time period, the history and the subject, the story-line was too adolescent, even after Rachel became a wife and widow and releasee. As Rachel got older, and stronger, the story seemed to get more and more contrived. I was let down."
5,"So good, I cried.","Lately I have found I have been judging books by their ability to make me feel emotion. At first I wondered if Moloka'i could do that. This story begins with Rachel as an innocent, naive little girl, suddenly thrown into an unfamiliar world separated from all that she knows and loves. Her character grows into her adult self in this world of isolation just as any young girl would. The author expertly conveys the growth of this character slowly over time.Shame and prejudice exist all over the world, only Rachel didn't realize that she was never alone until she found her family again.Moloka'i made me angry and made me cry. This is a wonderful story set in an unusual place and it is a must read on my list.Linda C. WrightAuthor, One Clown ShortOne Clown Short"
5,Amazing,"This is such as sweeping, visionary tale. It has characters that are so real and alive, and the juxtaposition of them against their physical torment and obstacles is fresh and moving. This is the first book in a long time that stuck with me long after I read it. A MUST READ!"
3,Interesting history on lepers,"Slow moving at times, but very historically interesting. I was not aware that lepers were sent to this island and required to live out their days there."
3,slow start but great finish,"After seeing the glowing reviews for this book I couldn't wait to read it. After forcing myself through the first half of the book which I found very boring and actually put the book down for days at a time I found the second half to be great. My guess is that is why there are so many excellent reviews, it ends well. The first half focuses on when the lead is a child and is a very slow read and then when it gets to her adulthood it often skips years at a time which I think would have been the most interesting part. Anyways, I don't think I'd recommend it to a friend but it was half worth it."
2,"Good, but not Great","While the author certainly took care to divine his tale from the historical record, the tenor of his writing failed to match the intensity of the story. After several chapters, the voice of the narrative seemed monotonous."
1,"poor writing, poor character development","This is a poorly written book with lightly developed characters. In short, this is a book about leprosy in Hawaii disguised as a novel.Makes for a laborious reading."
5,Wonderful,"Our book club, who has been together each month for over 6 years, loved this book. It is on our top 5 list. Wonderful story, easy to read, keeps moving, could not put it down."
2,made in china,"made in china or somewhere similar. Magnets fell out right away, fixed with hot glue gun. Magnets scratch fridge, beware. Once it's where you want it, and assembled/glued back together, it works fine."
1,Beg to differ,"I really like Liz and Dick, but this movie is crap. Silly and dated direction, weak screenplay, and highly questionable post production make this one almost unwatchable. I really don't understand the four and five star ratings. Another lame studio product hiding behing the great the Shakesphere cannon. Check out ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolf?"" Amazing."
4,Lovely performance,"I stared off reading Taming of Shrew for my 10 year old's bedtime using an modern english version of shakesphere stories, and thought the video would be a nice accompanyment. However, this nice accompanyment has quickly become on of my daughter's favorite videos. I haven't seen any of Taylor's other movies, but she does superb job as Kathrine and the wedding scene especially exemplifies her physical beauty. I'm a Liz Taylor fan as of now.There are some parts early on that seem irrelevant and boring, until Patrick Burton makes appearence, but the remaining 90% of the movie more than makes up for it."
4,Great Shakespear,"Although this play isn't politically correct now, it is still entertaining and witty. Some women may find it offensive due to its chauvenistic attitudes but then you have to remember that Shakespear did live in the 16th century.The cast is good and Elizabeth Taylor is sublime.The movie is true to the original play and very entertaining."
2,Get the UK version,"Firstly you only get the radio edit of the title track which is a bit of a rip off.If buying this cd, make sure its the UK version with the wounded buffalo mix which is the best remix there is of this song whic is found on a Little L single.The AUS version Little L does not have this, instead it has the Dlugosch mix and Dlugosch dub, the mix isnt too bad, very disco and the dub is just an instrumental version of this.The Bob Sinclair mix which is found on both versions of the single is an upbeat dancey remix, but at over 7 min it is a bit long overall."
3,Ford 4.6L book,"This was an OK book. I wish the performance section on the 10 various builds covered a 2 valve motor, with just a mild performance package, instead of all the ones for 4 valve motors, or 1000hp plus...I just want a nice street motor, putting out some decent power (300-325hp) without too many mods. But this book did give you some decent stock rebuilding info."
4,So Glad Of The Out Come,"Wicket Forest continues where Willow is left off ~ As I was reading along, I knew that I would not like Thatcher I hated his character, I just wanted to get in the book and strangle him ~ Willow is in love and she will put up with his family because she doesn't want to lose Thatcher. I loved Willow's Mom Grace even though Grace wasn't there for Willow growing up you can tell just how much she always loved her. Grace was the best Mom to Linden even though he was not all there at times in his mind. By reading along you can't help but wanting Grace to find love I picture her so young a beautiful, you know she was just dying to get out and live her life but she was scared to go out into the world she knew that Linden needed her. I don't want to give the book away but someone something happens to someone and I was so upset to find out who it was. That is my only complain of this book, other wise a great read ~Happy Reading Lisa"
3,Again with the letter... all right already.,"Willow... Wicked Forest... well her story is there and it is cool but the feelings and the relationships reminded me alot of FITA. I do enjoy that this time the ""pattern"" seems to be going with the original VCA but still... who didn't see it coming that the brother was going to freak?And the letter... Well you know... It WOULD be great if the girls would talk to each other... but these pitch advertisements? PLEASE! I know the GW knows all about all the VCA themed role-plays on the web and he knows we would all love to mesh the stories... Please do. But stop trying to sell books with these lame letters.Love VCA, Love the GW. Hate the ads."
4,Skechers Men's Crusades,"The shoes are very very nice and my husband love it so much, the problem is that the packaging done is so big when it can be packed to a smaller box just like my Monika Nine West and Steven Peep Toe shoes. It came out that the shipping charges is double than my 2 shoes. But the shoes is very nice. Please advise your packers to pack items in boxes just right for the item, no need for so many bubble wrap to minimize shipping costs."
3,Not bad,Was never a big fan of these guys. Paul Bastoph is a great drummer and the riffs are good. I prefer their first album over this.
2,not as great as I remembnered it,"I had Forbidden's Twisted Into Form back when it came out, and decided to check it out again recently. It is not nearly as good as I remembered it being, and is nowhere near the level of Megadeth, Slayer, or old Anthrax. The musicianship is solid, you can tell these guys are talented, especially drummer Paul Bastaph. But, the guitar riffs are not memorable, the solos are not impressive, and the songs just don't stand out in any way for me. I kind of put this in the same league as, but slightly beneath, Exodus' Pleasures of the Flesh, which is another album I used to really like but hasn't held up over time.Overall a decent thrash metal album to check out but there's a reason this band never achieved the same fame as Slayer, Metallica, Megadeth, and Anthrax. Standout tracks: Parting of the Ways intro, Out of Body"
5,FANTABULOUS!!,Above All Worshipdoes not get old! 2 cd set with a variety of Praise & Worship to fit your current worship mood.
3,Action and history,"Harry Fraser's ""Heroes of the Alamo"" is an enjoyable action western. Perhaps it is not strictly history, but it is a progressive take on the Alamo story that tells us more about the famous historic episode's background. Great to see Earle Hodgins in a starring role. He aquits himself well as the earnest and honest leader of the settlers Stephen Austin who respects Mexico's rights over Texas."
2,Ouch,"It does help with holding my shoulders back however, it really hurts my underarms so I can't wear it for long periods of time. Also, you do have to be careful with what you wear...it's not too thick but depending on the shirt you are wearing it does show through."
3,"It helps, but not great for smaller women","to remind you to pull your shoulders back. It just keeps riding up in the back. It's not designed for a small sized female (4-6). No matter how tight I set it, eventually it rides up my back. If it came in a smaller size, it would be better"
1,I should have believed other reviews,Previous product reviews stated that the device was uncomfortable to wear even over clothing to prevent chafing. I thought I would be able to modify the item but I was wrong. One size does not fit all and my attempt to add commercial bra extenders was not successful. Perhaps someone of slight size might be able to use the support brace. I could not. The picture is accurate and should be looked at carefully.
2,Good but Ouch,This works but it cuts into you runderarms as there is no padding on the straps. also I found myself adjusting it quite often as it would find itself traveling up my back.
2,Not that great,"The brace only served as a reminder to hold my shoulders back because if I didn't, it hurt worse than it did when I let them slouch. Very uncomfortable. Only wore it for about a week."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS!!,This posture band is a joke. It does not hold your shoulders back and after wearing for an hour the back strap had ridden all the way up to my neck and was showing out from under the back of my shirt. Talk about embarrassing.
3,posture perfect band-I would recommend this for 20-50 yr old,"When I first tried it, it was great! It kept my posture perfectly aligned, but as the band stretches it doesn't stay where it should be any more. I bought 5 all together so I change it every day. For the money I guess it's worth it , but not for long term. It's a great reminder that my shoulder rolls forward all the time which in long would create that ""hump back look"". Thank you for this product. R.,RN,CPAN, ICU, BLS Instructor, ASPAN member"
1,it hurts,"this product really hurt my shoulder when I put it on, it's useless to me and not worth the shipping and handling to return"
1,A Major Disappoitment,"For someone who revels in Slavic Opera to see an announcement for this video evokes major anticipation. Well, forget it. All my hopes were dashed to the ground on viewing. They are examples of the worst of late Soviet culture. In ""Aleko"" one doesn't know where the opera begins and ends for ""they"" have seen fit to have someone sing a gypsy folk-song to ""envelope"" the opera. It's as if the Soviets didn't trust it. They are both photographed in an outdoor setting leading to complete alienation for me. VAI has not seen fit to color-correct either of the magenta-tending prints of these 1986/87 films. I will now not have any inclination to purchase any of the Soviet opera videos from VAI."
4,nice background music,This is a CD you don't mind listening to over and over. It is ideal when you have company in the house or when you want to relax.
5,Great book,"You will be happy you purchased this book. It is great. The language is a little dated, but it has really good teaching on our Authority as a believer.The Authority of the Believer"
5,Can't go wrong.,I've been using these blades for years - they are the best blade per dollar for aluminum application that I know of. Take care of this blade and it will take care of you. Worth every dime.
3,Didn't know what to expect,"Since there was no information on what this book was about and it was free I gave it a try. I was looking for an inspirational book for a niece of mine who loves to read. I didn't read much of it because I was quickly aware that this is NOT intended for children - a fairly difficult read. So if you know an adult who would love a ""personal story"" view on history, this might be a good fit."
3,Slightly disappointed,"I am slightly disappointed with this book. There are wonderful suggestions and tips given throughout the entire book, however, there are multiple projects where steps are skipped or it is assumed the reader already knows how to perform a certain task. As a new crafter with precious metal clay, I need the steps written out clearly. Overall, though, the book was decent even though the images were sketches and not actual photos."
3,Better Than Nothing...,"This book has some very good techical info, including how to make rings that actually fit, but it also some major drawbacks:1) The directions on some projects have omitted steps and steps out of order, making it difficult for beginners to follow.2) The projects are not artistic, even downright amateurish, so you won't find new creative ideas here.3) There is a tendancy toward reliance on metalsmithing skills to correct problems that could have (should have!) been resolved in the clay stage before firing. This is understandable, since the author is a skilled metalsmith, but it isn't practical for many newcomers to PMC. And it isn't necessary, since most problems can easily be corrected at either the wet clay stage, or the leather-hard stage.Even with all its faults, it's still the best book out there on PMC at this time."
3,Worth reading,"I found this absorbing and entertaining, although I found the female officer D.D. coarse, unnecessarily nasty and disagreeable and Dodge a pushover who cannot control his sexual urges. Not qualities one exactly hopes for in policing, and so could not find them sympathetic.That said, it was a quick fun read at a great price. I did figure out immediately as he entered the picture who the UPS man was - Ms Garner is no Agatha Christie - but I would buy another of her novels just for an evening's diversion.Hide"
3,disappointing ending..,I was really enjoying this book but the end was so ridiculous that I gave it 3 stars. There were so many implausible mistakes by the police and main character who was supposedly trained from infancy to protect herself that I became frustrated. I like the series will give next book as try but hoping for better..
4,"Suspenseful, but predictable","I thought this book was much better than ""Alone,"" the previoius Bobby Dodge book. It was a definite page-turner that was hard to put down.It was fairly easy to figure out who the bad guy was, but much more suspenseful figuring out how all the bad guys fit together. That alone made it worth reading.The whole ending was weak though, and I was bothered by the fact that we had it drummed into us throughout the book what a defense expert Annabelle was, yet she seemed pretty defenseless when confronted.All in all, definitely worth the read."
5,Really interesting read.,"I really enjoyed Hide. Although I usually can figure out the ending, on this one I couldn't. The characters were well developed and interesting. I will definitely read more books by this author."
4,Good Summer Read,"I had read The Neighbor by Lisa Gardner and enjoyed it so decided to give this a try. I'm pretty picky with my book selections and if I don't enjoy the first 20 pages of a book, I'll easily abandon it. But this book definitely intrigued me quickly.I think the author's style of writing tends to wrap up the ending/final conflict very neatly and simply so this book was definitely typical of Gardner's style. However, the suspense and mystery of the book leading up to the climax was a delicious read. She also creates charaters with whom you really connect. The book reads quick and is definitely an entertaining mystery/suspense to read over the summer."
5,"Live in Detroit, Vol. 2","Best I've ever heard, especially the song Oh What Love. I had the cassette, it was destroyed in the car from the heat and can't get another Live in Detriot, (cassette tape). I would love to know how I could order this especially if you have a the longer version of Oh What Love."
5,"Vickie Winan's Live in Detroit, Vol. II","I bought this CD because the Church was singing ""What Love"" and I needed the lyrics. I am pleasantly surprised. The entire CD is wonderful."
5,A Friend in Kansas - IT'S ANOINTED AND POWERFUL!,"Vickie Winans continues to let the Lord use her in delivering an anointed, energetic, uplifting and powerful gospel message in song! Each song will bless and encourage your soul! I also encourage you to go out and buy the video - As always, you will definitely worship and praise God, cry a little and laugh a lot! And to Vickie - Don't ever lose your spiritual focus nor sense of humor Vickie!"
1,Money Wasted,"This version is VERY OLD! The maps are from 1985 and do NOT include trail data. Get the Trails Illustrated maps instead, you'll be MUCH better off!"
2,You get what you pay for. Don't expect it to last long.,"This was great for about 3 weeks.Our dog is ~85 lbs. and needs help getting up the stairs.While this product worked, it worked well. But it tore after 3 weeks. Thankfully we noticed before using it."
5,Helps get my lab upstairs,My poor lab is having problems climbing stairs and I certainly cannot pick him up so this item helps him feel more secure in going up the stairs. Works great
2,NOT IMPRESSED,THE HARNESS IS DIFFICULT TO GET ON THE DOG AND ANYONE WITH PETS KNOWS THEY DO NOT STAY STILL HAS TOO MANY PLASTIC LATCHES (3) SHOULD USE VELCRO. STRAP THAT GOES AROUND DOGS SEEMS TO CHOKE THEM AND WHEN YOU LIFT HIM IT PUTS MORE WEIGHT ON THE DOG'S HIND LEGS.
1,not good these are refurbished units,"It has a great picture and good sound I really liked it, but I should have had a clue. Stamped on the front of the manual it says products sold as is. It lasted for about a month and that was that. I'll try and contact Amazon to see if I can get it repaired. I should have know better. Amazon should have posted that they are AS IS!"
2,Not her best work...,"I can usually finish a good book in a day. I've been trying to finish this one for a week. The lead male character, Lucas, is just not very likeable. When he's told no, that just means she needs more convincing with his hands and mouth. Don't get me started on the plot, its just not an enjoyable read..."
1,A Craven Money Grab,"A terrific disappointment. This game, unlike all of the other Trivial Pursuit games, includes a slim half-box of questions (compared to 2 full boxes for questions for other Trivial Pursuit games). Furthermore, the questions are geared toward movie minutae (for example, how many days did Sean Astin have to wear his hobbit feet? Who cares?) Tolkien's created universe is so wonderfully rich and complex, and I was looking forward to really testing my knowledge of elvish lore and Rohirrim geneology and the like. This game, however, ignores most of the mythology and the events in the novels, focusing instead on the films. Don't waste your time or your money."
2,"This Should Have Been Called a ""Junior Edition""","This game may be fun for the casual fan or family who viewed the films. For a devoted fan of the movies, the only challenging category is the one directly concerned with the technical aspects of making the films. Otherwise, it's strictly junior league. I hope the company will consider a real ""Tolkien"" edition, from Silmarillion to Lord of the Rings, to give the real fans a challenge. While I realize the game may serve to bring friends together, fans of the movies will quickly find their boredom meter pegged; the game does not have lasting potential for repeated playing."
3,Not all that impressed even though I had fun,"I was very excited about this game and bought it for my birthday. I was disappointed to find only one box of questions and only movie trivia. I am a Tolkien fan, though not as much of a purist as I could be, and wanted to have fun. I have played it twice now and have finished the games in less than 30 minutes, having played with people who know the movies as well or better than I do. The only category that gives us pause is the Film and Production category.Overall, a good product but there should be more questions and it should have been combined with questions from the book."
5,Good game....but a warning for hardcore fans....,"This is fun for fans of the series to get together, but be warned: everyone else you know, everywhere you go, will come out holding it and wearing a big smirk and tell you ""now it's time to prove how much you know....."" Expect to be entertained with friends but annoyed by everyone else with it."
5,CSA LOTR TP review,"I really had fun playing this game, though, some of the answers on the cards you would not know if you hadn't read the book. That might put some people off.I love the little figures, and the board is pretty neat.Good fun."
1,won't cut straight & dulls quickly,"I have had a very hard time with this blade. The first one I bought would be off by about 1/8 of an inch on a 5 inch tall board when cutting a 45 degree miter. I took this blade back to Home Depot and they exchanged it for a new one, (points to Home Depot). The replacement blade cut straight, wonderful! This blade however has gone very dull very quickly. I did cut some hardwood flooring that seems to be the issue, but it shouldn't be. I have several other Freud products that are all great, including a table saw blade. I can only think that this blade is made at a different factory or with different materials etc."
3,Product is the right size.....but,"I got these to install the Polk Audio DB651 6.5"" speakers in the rear of my 2006 Scion XB. While they did fit the holes properly, they were too thick. In the end, I ended up cutting my adapters out of hardwood and using that instead. The wood was thin enough to keep the speakers from pressing against the panels of the car."
1,Mathematical Elements for Computer Graphics,"While written over 24 years ago, I was hoping this book would give me an understanding of the mathematical basis (if not the current state-of-the art;) ) of computer graphics. Despite (arguable to many) years of university math courses, I found this volume merely humbling, rather than enlightening. If you are more comfortable with fairly advanced mathematical notation and concepts than most, especially relative to geometry, you may find this book useful. I found it only marginally useful -- primarilly as a reference to some concepts I had previously been exposed. Best of luck."
5,Acoustic Praise 2-CD Album from AMAZON,"I had originally bought the ""Acoustic Praise - Quartet"" album some 15 plus years ago, then recently I wanted to buy it again as a gift, unfortunately, there were no more issues to be had, instead, they have re-issued it as a 2-CD Album, which they included the ""Acoustic Praise - Guitar"" album as well.With this 2-Album Set, it made my purchase, this time around, even that much more sweeter! All the music on both albums are really great spiritual instrumental songs to listen to & to meditate on...JUST SO BLISSFUL & BLESSFUL!I give it a HARDY BIG 2-THUMBS UP!!...YOU JUST GOTTA BUY IT!!!"
2,Listening only-don' t try to hula to it,"This Hawaiian music tape does not have good sound quality, and they have mixed traditional with modern versions of classic songs which makes it very hard to impossible to hula to. It's main use as I see it would be background music at a luau or Hawaiian party. Since I hula, I wish I had been able to preview the sound and type of music before I ordered it.Diane Cutler"
3,Cinematic style music - pleasant but no masterpiece,"Ferrero tries to paint a picture of the Spanish conquest of Aztec Mexico with pleasant, if unadventurous, music very much in the cinematic style. Both the tragedy and the adventure are conveyed clearly by solid playing from the Ukraine National. There's nothing earth shattering in the music, but it is pleasant.It's good to see solidly tonal neo-romanticism gaining more and more ground, however, and if it heralds a return to themed music and the tone poem, I'm all for it."
4,Are you a mother to your man?,"Wow!!! This book is eye opening. It helped me to see why women are inclined to ""mother"" their men!!! There are underlying pyschological reasons women decide to get into relationships where they are acting like a mother ( putting the mans needs and feelings before their own). This book explains why. If your giving more than your getting you need to read this book!!! And then read Pat Allens ""Getting to I do"""
2,Stick with the orignals,"I am a huge beach boy fan myself, and I find the orignals to be better. Their voices had a melodic ring, and the real ones should not try to be impersonated. Some of these songs are OK though for kids singing them."
2,Read this and buy Endless Summer instead for your child!,I was disappointed by the versions of Beach Boy songs on this CD. I did not feel that these versions for children added anything to the original songs. I am sure your children will enjoy the (mainly) short and joyful tunes of the original artist.
1,Lacking in Durability,We bought this set and threw it away in the span of about an hour. The clothes are way too small to fit on any of my daughter's dozen barbies. The straps on the tank and the dress broke the instant I tried to slip them on. The skirt fit but is too bulbous to be attractive. This set is just too flimsy.
4,Best Dallas read!,"This book is my favorite Dallas book, and I've read almost all of them. I like that there's mystery involved; I was fascinated by her descriptions of Denver in the 1930's, and her small town Mississippi felt reminiscent of Miss Havisham's house. There's that flimy sense of nostalgia and romance here, like one sees in an old movie, but the characters have modern, true-to-life conflicts to resolve."
2,This doll is very small,The doll is very small - only about 6-7 inches tall. This isn't clear in the doll's description.
5,"GREAT CD, THESE LADIES ARE GOING TO GO PLACES","I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR A NEW SOUND FOR A LONG TIME AND THESE LADIES HAVE ""IT"" THE MUSIC IS AS GOOD AS THEY LOOK, SPECTACULAR. I AM WAITING MY NEXT ENCOUNTER WITH THIS GROUP. IS THERE A FAN CLUB,HOW DO I FIND OUT MORE ABOUT THIS GROUP."
4,This group sounds pretty good.,"I was listening to my step-son's CD of this single and while this is not normally my kind of music I really liked the song ""Do the Right Thing""."
2,"Great at charging, but wont sync","I ordered this product based on the claim that it would be able to Sync with my iRiver H10 and allow me to add more songs to it. I needed a new Sync cable, because I had lost mine, and thought that this pack was a great deal so I went for it. When I received the items, everything appeared fine, and all of the charging devices worked. However, when I used the USB cable to Sync with my computer, all it did was charge my H10. It would not sync to the computer for information exchange. Obviously I was very perturbed by this, so I called the company I purchased it from, and they sent me a new cable swiftly to fix the problem. However, when the cable arrived it had the same problem. So I spent several days troubleshooting, only to come to the conclusion that I should have just bought a cable direct from iRiver."
4,"Beautiful throws, expensive yarn","I bought my copy of this book from Tricoter, as well as the yarn for the project. See the finished product as the first (only) photo in the image section. The throw came out absolutely beautiful, and will definitely be a family heirloom. It's wonderfully soft and warm as well. The yarn cost more than $1,000 when bought from Tricoter."
1,YIKES! Headless dancers!,"I guess I should have caught on to the play on words in the title - ""Hip to Toe"". I am a dance instructor looking for new ideas for my preschool and elementary dancers. This is NOT what I hoped for by any stretch of the imagination! The description claims this is an ""Award Winning Rhyming Sensation"" - how misleading! My children were NOT entranced with this strange combination of headless dancers tapping and twirling to spoken nursery rhymes. We were all quite turned off by the sheer weirdness of the whole presentation. YIKES! I would obviously not recommend this DVD to anyone in the ""real"" world looking for children's entertainment or training materials but it may have some ""artistic"" value for those whose tastes run to the ""artsy"" and unique."
5,Electronic Talking!,"As a huge clue fan I felt that I had to buy this because it had a talking gameboard. I was shocked when I opened it to find that it is practically nothing like the original clue. It has suspects, locations and weapons on cards still, but there is no dice and you have to ""interview"" all of the suspects (you look in their envelope which has a card in it...it's hard to explain). Since me and my college friends have nothing better to do we've played it almost every night since we got it. Its a really fun game if you go into it thinking that you are not really playing clue, and you are just playing some new game. But in the end, we have played at least 3 games every night, sometimes staying up until 4am.It's really fun but DONT THROW AWAY YOUR REGULAR CLUE!!(ps. one really negative thing is that since you aren't a suspect and you are a detective, there is a max of 4 players. One plus this that now you can play clue with 2 players.)"
5,Great Game,"Everyone in the family loves this game, even the kids. It was purchased for the adults. We love the original clue. This is different but just as fun. I was not certain how well it would hold up but I have been pleseantly surprised. So far everyone else has bought their own copy of the game. They love it too! The kids like listening and following where the people are going. It helps in their reasoning skills."
3,Clue FX Review,"This game plays exactly like the original Clue, except there are more suspects and more weapons. Also, it talks to you! The butler gives tips and encouragement, THOUGH IT CAN GET REPETITIVE. Also, this time around you're not playing as a suspect, you're playing as a detective. There are only 4, to my disappointment. However, now you can play Clue with 2 players.FINAL WORD:If you're a casual game enthusiast, Clue FX might be worth a look. However, if you are a serious Clue fan, this is an awful product that is not worth your time or money."
4,great service,"shipping was kind of slow but i contacted them about it and they took care of it, great customer service."
1,Man Box,"This is a perfect film for any man who wants to be frozen in time. Every stereotype that a man should aim to defy -- strength through violence, sex through coercion, wisdom through silence and scowling -- is depicted in this film. Yes, it is compelling and hard to turn away from. I can't imagine many women would enjoy this film."
4,Best Eastwood Western,"""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly"" is a slightly better film than ""High Plains Drifter."" However, Eastwood is almost upstaged by Eli Wallach in that classic Spaghetti Western. In ""High Plains Drifter,"" what you get is the quintessential, undiluted ""Man with No Name"" character, with all the mayhem and intimidation that comes with it.The story is interesting and contains an important moral point about cowardice and conformity. The film ends with a ghostlike eerieness, which Eastwood used again in ""Pale Rider"" several years later. In summary, ""High Plains Drifter"" offers an excellent alternative to the countless run-of-the-mill westerns produced over the years."
4,Minor classic in the man against the mob genre,"""It's what people see inside themselves that makes them afraid"" intones Jim Duncan (or his living ghost) as he climbs out of the bed of the woman he has just ""enjoyed"". A man of honour who seeks revenge on a whole town who stood by while he was apparently whipped to death by guns hired to kill him because he would not hide the fact the town was mining illegally on government property, Clint Eastwood is brilliant as is the magic photography of Bruce Surtees. All who deserve it get their come-uppance and one of the final images of Clint standing in front of a wall of flame is straight out of the course Old Testament Revenge 101. A minor classic of the genre."
4,A bear-classic fable of the Old West,"High Plains Drifter is a superior Eastwood Western that takes ""The Man With No Name"" characterone step further into the realm of myth. Is Eastwood's character the returned spirit of the betrayed sheriff or an avenging angel? You'll have to make up your mind yourself.An impressive tale of revenge and atonement. Four stars."
3,Not too bad for plagiarism,"Don't get me wrong, I like these old Eastwood westerns as much as the next guy, but this movie is almost a direct steal from a ""Bonanza"" eisode called ""Twilight Town"" that aired ten years before this movie came out. I have no respect for plagiarism no matter who stars in the movie. I did give it a few for entertainment value."
1,Home Where I belong,This is the wrong CD. I ordered Home Where I belong by BJ Thomas.It is not worth the cost of mailing it back to get it replaced so I just threw it away and will not buy on Amazon any more. I learned my lesson.
1,no flash,"This item shipped super fast, but upon opening the package it went down hill from there. The screw was extremely difficult to open. The actual screw started to strip. Once I opened the little basketball, the battery appeared to big. I forced it in and after struggling with the screw again, the thing would not work. Also most difficult to put on the net."
3,Wish it would work with my chamberlain opener,"Product description states ""learn button"". It doesn't say the ""learn button"" is on the opener or the remote. Make sure your opener has a purple button, that's the learn button. There is not one on my opener, so this remote is not compatible."
5,Very happy with this purchase,"The company that sold this got it from California to Pennsylvania in like 3 days. The price was right, it worked great and I am very please with the whole experience. Would definitely make a purchase with this company again."
1,Dissapointed,"I had loved Eat, Pray, Love and was excited to hear another of Elizabeth Gilbert's creations. I was unable to ge tthrough it. I had loved hearing Elizabeth Gilbert read her novel but the actress who read this was some what abrasive in her tone."
1,Sweethearts - will be returned to Vendor - can't watch,I have tried to play this Video and it is impossible to watch. The screen is constantly moving up and down.
2,This is not the Victor Herbert operetta Sweethearts,"This is not the Victor Herbert operetta Sweethearts. Yes, it has the name and the composer's name, but, as typical for Hollywood at the time, the story line and many of the songs that formed the basis of the operetta were discarded. If you want to see the operetta you will need to find one of the few companies that perform it live. This film is a Nelson Eddie, Jeannette MacDonald musical -- nice dancing, nice singing, opulent staging but little to do with the operetta that Victor Herbert wrote. Incidentally the color is gorgeous."
4,Terrific,"I teach animation to kids and this is a really fun one for them to do. They always think it's pretty cool to see the animation in the reflection & create their own loops. The little led light never really worked and it's hard to keep it from bending but it's been handled by lots of kids, so maybe just for 1-2 kids it would stand up a bit longer."
4,cute but not the best,"I bought this toy for my daughter's 5th birthday. She loves it because she is a huge Hello Kitty fan. It comes with crayons and colored pencils with holders for each of them. The best part is that there is a roll of pictures that you pull out to color. The problem with this toy is that the pages do not line up well when it is time to tear them off. Also, the colored pencils break constantly--much more so than other colored pencils that we use. Overall, it is a fun toy and she does love playing with it, but it does not seem to be very well designed."
2,Windows Mobile Stinks!!!!,"The hardware is great, I eventually exchanged it for the palm OS version. However, the memory issues and constant freezing of the windows mobile OS made me miss calls and become very familiar with hard resets. You'll constantly have to go into the task manager to close applications that are still resident in the memory.The most frustrating part for me is when it decided to hang while there was an incoming call. After a 30-45 second hard boot you'll have to call them back and explain that your phone froze.After switching to the Palm OS version of this device I never had a problem. I love the windows interface, but it's just to buggy and unstable. (I could insert a snarky Microsoft comment here, but why beat that dead horse)PS... Friends have also told me that other devices they own with Windows Mobile also have stability issues. So it doesn't seem like this is isolated to the Treo."
1,horrible quality,"This item was received in the following condition: a dented and bent column. This was not due to any shipping issues, that is just how it was packaged. The metal is so flimsy, it was not surprising how easily it could dent or bend. When ordering this item, be sure to realize just the spices were bottled in the USA, the actual rack is made in China, which accounts for the poor quality and shoddy workmanship. Do yourself a favor and buy something made in the USA which will hold spices without any issues of poor quality. I would give this 0 stars, but had to pick at least one."
1,Terrible product packaging and customer service,"I ordered this product for my husband for Father's Day. He opened his gift on Father's Day to discover that it had several dents in it and it was lopsided. I returned the product and requested a replacement. My replacement arrived within 2 days, but it was THE SAME PRODUCT. They returned the exact same spice rack to me...dents and all. I'm keeping it because I don't want to go to all that trouble again, but I will NEVER again purchase anything from this company. I would have given this product zero stars, but Amazon wouldn't let me."
2,Cheap build!,"I was cleaning a shelf, and my 5 day old spice rack tipped over, and fell to the ground. It is warped and damaged beyond repair from a simple fall."
3,Great!!!,The movie was just as good when I first saw it. Good movie! Would recommend this movie to a friend
4,good against evil,a typical story of good against evil. Goodness always prevails over evil as there is nothing to be gained in being an enemy of someone.The Commando Elite do battle with the Gargonites only to find that they are not the superior breed.A film well worth watching.
4,Nice movie,"If you liked the movies ""Critters"" or ""Gremlins"", you'll like this movie too. Except in this movie, you throw in more advanced special effects in computer animation and have two opposing types of toy soldiers."
2,Kids Movie only,i would say this movie's rated 9 and under. it had no REAL story and not very good acting. besides a few funny line on the part of the fake acters it was a disapointment
1,No Reedming Value,"I saw this at the theatre last summer and was sorely disappointed. It is a very mean-spirited movie and the values it espouses are not what I would want for my kids or anyone else's. The only characters with any decency of morals are the underdog toys whose names I can't remember. But I couldn't garner any sympathy whatsoever for any of the human characters or the soldiers. From the very beginning in which the boy acquires the toys in a dishonest manner, to the way people and toys treat each other throughout the movie, I was simply disgusted. This is a movie of excess; unfortunately, it is excessively poor."
1,WHAT??,"This was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The plot was stupid and simple and totally not creative. If you like this movie then you've got something wrong with you. Totally not an original plot. The only people that should like this movie are little five through eight year old children. If you've never seen this don't waste your money by renting it or buying it. Try to avoid this movie big time. This doesn't deserve three in a half stars, it doesn't even deserve this one star that I'm giving it. I will say once again that this movie was a discrace to all movies, it totally sucks!!!"
3,cheesy but entertaining,"What made this movie a bit original was the role-reversal - one expects the soldiers to be the good guys while the beasts are the bad guys, but this story offers a fun turnabout in a movie about toys coming to life."
2,A Wall of Guitar Driven Noise,"Not nearly as accessible as past efforts like Blue Sky Mining or Earth and Sun and Moon, this album harkens back to their punk roots (yeah, they go back that far). Not melodic, just angry and noisy. I feel like I've been cheated of their musical talents and left with just the political lyrics.I admit it took nearly a year for me to get behind Breathe and maybe this one will grow on me too. Right now, though, I have serious doubts. If you're new to the Oils, check out some of their other titles first. This won't gain them any followers."
2,Oils trying too hard to be hip,"REDNECK WONDERLAND is a weak effort by the Oils. They apparently were angered by the election of a conservative prime minister, John Howard, and this anger shows, but is not effectively translated into powerful music.There is a good mini-album here if you listen to tracks #5,6,8,9 and 10. My personal favorite track is #9, ""Seeing Is Believing."" The Oils have always made creative use of the studio, so the use of state-of-the-art techniques and producers (Magoo), is not the problem per se, but the album fails in the same way that U2's POP does -- it sounds like they're trying too self-consciously to sound like heavy metal, and like techno-rock, on some tracks, and others (the last two) are just lame.They made one more album after this one before breaking up, in 2002, and it was much better:CAPRICORNIA."
5,Reference issues!,One of the jewels items of the music with the fierce splendor and monstrous technique of Jasha Heifetz: a collector item specially by Sibelius. This version is one the three top performances ever made. The other two to my mind would be Ivry Gitlis and Ginette Neveu.In Tchaikovsky violin concerto I rather choose other recordings. It is an excellent version but it lacks Russian fierce and musicality.
3,Entertaining but threadbare mystery,"I'm surprised that ""The False Inspector Dew"" has received such critical acclaim. Though the book is certainly entertaining--it's gifted with Lovesey's devilish wit and gift for strong characterization--the supposedly ""ingenious"" plot is not nearly as well-crafted as one would hope. The plot twists aren't jarring enough to be truly exciting, and the reader isn't given enough evidence to guess the surprise ending. Clever, to be sure, but the construction isn't nearly as deft as it should be."
3,About the edition,"-The paperback edition:After a month of using it -and rarely used- the cover and back started to fall apart curving and piling dramatically which has turned the book in almost unusable book (see the photo in this page at the beginning...)-About the text:First this a graduate text so if you are undergraduate or self-learning study, skip this book and go for another.For graduate: Well, It is not a bad book but I rather preferClassical Electricity and Magnetism: Second Edition (Dover Books on Physics)by Panofsky and Phillips the topics are worked in more detail and clearer.I hope this can help."
3,"A Cliched Re-entry, but Fun to Watch","Fortress 2: Re-entry is set ten years after the events of the first film, where John Brennick (played once again by Christopher Lambert) is living in North America with is new wife and son, but his happiness is about to be ruined. Three strangers appear asking him to them destroy Men-Tel's new power station. He declines their offer, but within moments Men-Tel helicopters appear. Jon lets himself be captured so his wife and son can escape. This time John is put into a space prison a satellite orbiting the Earth, in which it is the inmates' job to repair it.I've never seen the first movie, which I heard was good, so I had low expectations when I started to watch the sequel. Yes, the dialogue is predictable and the plot is clichéd, but considering it was a direct-to-video it has decent special effects and acting in it. It's not the greatest science fiction movie ever made, but I had fun watching it."
1,A Very bad sequel,"The first Fortress is quite good. It was directed by Stuart Gordon (of Re-animator). The sequel Fortress II Re-entry is directed by Geoff Murphy (who directed two very good sequels: Young Guns 2 and Under Siege 2) so I say to myself, it can't be that bad. Well, I was wrong. This is an awful movie. The action scenes are not realistic and plain boring. The plot, what plot? Not worth mentioning. It is a complete waste of time. Luckily, The DVD picture quality is good and the dolby 5.1 is not bad as well. But again not worth getting it not even a rental. Skip this turkey."
1,One of the worst movies ever,"I wonder if the producers knew how horrible this movie was before they foisted it on the public? Others have gone into the details about why it's so bad. Suffice it to say that had Michael Corleone flown through space with no protective gear and had no ill effects from it, the Godfather would've received 1 star. So this film, in combination with all its other horrible elements, deserves negative stars. Ugh - what a waste of time."
2,Doesn't add up to the original...,"Our story picks up about ten years where the original ended. Brannick is caught and put in a new prison, this time in space orbiting Earth. The characters are plenty fun and the humor is well-placed, but the acting and overall script leave much to be desired. The film is very watchable, but little comes from it. Christopher Lambert is not a good enough actor to make his character as interesting as he was in the first film, but his supporting cast is not all bad. Mostly, I liked the computer effects and some of the action was neat. The star rating can be ignored here. I really give it 2 1/2, but Amazon.com won't let me do halves."
2,don't like,Not what I expected. Too hard to use on the wheels of my piano. Will damage the wood floor for sure.
5,Great Collection,This is an amazing collection of action figures for X-men fans. It includes fan favorites Gambit Rogue Wolverine and Beast along with Magneto. Rogue's face is a little off and she towers over Gambit (as does Wolverine) but it's nice to see really nice sculpts of these great characters. Definitely a great addition to anyone's collection and an awesome low price.
2,A little too bossa nova,"This CD arrived in a timely manner and was in excellent condition.I give it two stars because I bought it on a friend's recommendation. Elli has a beautiful voice, but the music is a little too bossa nova for me. I was expecting early jazz fusion."
2,clint runs afowl of the cold war again,maybe it's because he is such a stright shooter(pun ment) or something but clint doesn't do cold war thrillers very well(remember firefox). while well directed and acted this spy thriller is dead most of the way through and while the climbing scenes are good they don't cover up the fact that it was a good book that doesn't watch as good as it read.some may like it but i found it to be a let down.
5,Simply the Best,"It's a short review: this is simply the best blues I've ever heard. I immediately lament the passing of such an amazing artist and such an amazing sound. Buy it, play it, share it."
5,Asteroids Add the Missing Detail in the Charts,"This is a wonderful book written by someone very experienced in astrological research. It is full of wonderful asteroid work connected to myths. It is not for the beginner, but if you have your meat and potatoes astrology behind you; this book is a mind blower adding the Italian parsley, basil, shallots and capers to the blend.The nuances and differences are well described by adding asteroids. You will want to add to your astrological vocabulary if you have the basics down. This book will open up new astrological and intellectual horizons!Think of having a good vocabulary, but upping the ante with a huge vocabulary using the asteroids and other important points. It is also chock full of other interesting finds for the more experienced astrologer with a few years of practice behind them.I highly recommend this book."
3,Same as Raytek MT6,"Appears to be a Fluke-rebranded version of the Raytek MT6, which sells for half the price. I have plenty of respect for Fluke, but in this case it's hard to justify paying twice as much to get their name on the case. I bought the Raytek MT6, and it's excellent.Raytek MT6 Non-contact MiniTemp Infrared Thermometer"
2,sticky trigger,the Fluke 62 is a very ergonomic and simple tool to use. It provides accurate and fast temperature readings in fahrenheit and celsius in a range which is probably adequate for 99% of users.My Fluke has a sticky trigger and hence the laser stays on even when you remove your finger from the trigger. It takes a fair bit of unnatural manipulating to get it to turn off which makes using it annoying. I tried dabbling a drop of teflon oil where the plastic trigger meets the electronic switch but this did not make much of an improvement.In theory this should go back to the manufacturer as a defect- but I have not yet done this. I will see how responsive the customer service is.
5,Simply fantastic,"One of the best tools in my shed.Very accurate readings, easy to handle and versitile. Resolving problems such as wheelbrake condition, cold drafts in buildings, ac performance, engine cooling problems, bearing condition etc becomes extremely simple by using temperature as a startingpoint.I just whish I had bought it sooner./Henrik"
4,A Bargain for the Headline Work,"I bought this album as an inexpensive way go get Berlioz' setting of La Marsaillaise. It is played and sung with remarkable precision and flair, especially for a relatively unknown orchestra. Phillipe Entremont communicates his cultural roots to his forces with nothing lost in transmission. I would have preferred shorter breaths between the verses, but the energy of the performance and the spaciousness of the sound call up a vision of Berlioz conducting an outdoor performance in which the audience of thousands joined in the refrain! It was a breath of fresh air after seeing ""A Capitol Fourth (2011)"" with the finale accompanied by the singularly inappropriate strains of ""God Save the Tsar"" from Thaikovsky's 1812 overture. The rest of the disc's program is performed in a workmanlike but not inspired fashion."
5,Comprehensive and balanced,"This book provides an excellent coverage of a critical period in India's history. The subject is approached in a comprehensive manner, using the findings of history, archaeology, and literature. Throughout the book, Thapar is fair-minded and balanced. Other Americans who have read this book have uniformly had a positive reaction. I therefore cannot understand the bile that has been spilt by the reader from Agra. Perhaps Indians like their history to be little more than propaganda for the country. Praise Heaven that Thapar takes a more intellectually honest route."
5,old but good,"i loved voltron as a kid so i got it for my son who is 4 years old and he likes it a lot. it's a good change from Thomas the Train, Speed Racer, or today's toons from disney etc. this is japanese animation and it's old so it's very different."
5,Blast from the past,This is a godsend to all who grow up watching the show after school back in the mid 80's. Set is very nice I have all 5 and have watched them all the way through. FLAWLESS in my opion. Just might make you go out and buy a 130$ masterpiece voltorn off ebay. DOn't say I didn't warn you. Hope a toy line comes back out with this great toy so mom's and dad's buying this for thier lil guys can get the toy to without having to pay a arm and a leg for the collectible ones
5,Happy with underpriced wedding band,"I had shopped at every jewelry store in a 60 mile radius for just the right wedding band. Once I found it, I searched for the same product on Amazon.com and found the same exact item for just over half the price. It came in the timeframe I had been promised and fits and looks perfect."
3,Not as good as Intervention,I read this series and was not impressed. I found it cliched and badly written. This put me off reading the Intevention series which is connected (though tenuously). When I did read a friends copy of Intervention because I was deperate for something to read I loved it and I find it hard to believe that the same person wrote both series. A lot of people disagree.
4,Beautiful film,This was a gift for a friend who dreams of Africa. This film is an excellent view if you are in love with Africa.
3,Eh,"I don't get it: why do so many people find Africa beautiful?To me, an African landscape has all the charm of a weedy empty lot in Long Island City.Why would anyone want to live in such an ugly place?"
3,Change of character does Eastwood good,"Play Misty For Me is worth seeing if only because Clint Eastwood doesn't just glint and fire for once. He actually has to act(and direct), and is surprisingly good at both! As a popular California disk jockey, Clint engages in what seems like a harmless one night stand with fan Jessica Walter. However Donna Mills, as Clint's ex-girlfriend, pops up and their rekindling ignites Walter's rage. Although vital to the plot, Mills's and Eastwood's screentime together is a drag on the suspense. As the odd woman out, Walter lacks the deviate, cunning nature that a villian is supposed to posess. Perhaps it's her puppy dog eyes and aw shucks! nature that made me feel sorry for her instead of root against her. And the ending of Play Misty For Me is abrupt and disappointing. All in all though, Clint's directorial debut isn't bad. Moreover, his willingness to temporarily toss his cowboy hat and holster the .44 Magnum shows that there's brains behind that brawn."
2,Ouch!,"I might be the only one who detests this movie. I detest it because of the way it makes me feel.You see, I identify with Jessica Walter, the female lead. She falls in love with Clint Eastwood after a very brief affair, and she wants to continue seeing him, and he rejects her.And after he rejects her she feels (as we all do) deeply hurt (the kind and intensity of that hurt varying from individual to individual).I know there is a certain decorum to reacting to rejection; there is good form and bad form. And JW followed bad form and was inappropriate. But I nevertheless identified with her, and Clint Eastwood's repeated attempts to ""deal"" with her made me despise him and feel all dirty inside and degraded."
4,Walter's Star Turn,"I saw this movie again last night after many years and was pleasantly surprised that it still stood up so well. Jessica Walter's performance is creepy and compelling, and Eastwood is suitably baffled and unsettled by the way events unfold. An impressive directorial debut from Eastwood in which the star, at least partly, plays against type. Well worth seeing."
4,Embarrassed!,"I just received this gift pack in the mail yesterday. It is a gift for my 4 year old son...I could not believe what Elektra looked like! I am embarrassed beyond words...there is no way I would even let my daughter play with this figure! She may be part of the package, but she certainly won't be part of my son's gift. I will definately take her out and dispose of her...this should really be geared for much older kids, especially if Elektra is included!! You don't see the ""male"" figures protruding anything! Sorry, Elektra, but you aren't welcome in my home!"
5,Old Fashioned Metal Jacks & Ball,Recently I had some young girls over the house and we played jacks. I used to play jacks when I was a young girl and loved it. I was amazed at how uncoordinated the girls were. This game helped teach eye-hand coordination and a lot more and we had fun at the same time. Get rid of the computer and TV and have some real fun.
5,Metal Jacks and Rubber Ball Set,bought it for a friend who was the JACKS champion in 1975!She loved itjust like we remembered from the glory days
3,GREAT STORIES ABOUT OUR MOMS.,IT IS A TREAT TO READ ABOUT DIFFERENT STORIES ABOUT VARIOUS MOTHERS. THIS BOOK REMINDS US HOW IMPORTANT OUR MOMS ARE.WE SHOULD ALWAYS GIVE THEM CREDIT FOR THIER GUTS ON BEING MOMS.
4,A Hair Affair,"The film is a mockumentary about Crawford Mackenzie (Craig Ferguson) a Glasgow, Scotland hairdresser who dreams of hitting it big 'for the little people.' When he gets an invite to the World Hairdressers International Finals, he believes he is to be a competitor. He arrives in LA only to have his dream shattered. He was only invited as a guest.But Crawford is not the kind of man who gives up easily. His machinations to get into the competition are hilarious. I cannot say I am a huge fan of this genre of film, but ""The Big Tease"" was thoroughly enjoyable and worth the time.Rebecca Kyle, August 2008"
5,Offers a rare & recommended view into creative consciousness,"Aptly edited by experienced needlecrafter Dianne Hire, Oxymorons: Absurdly Logical Quilts is a fascinating book that displays quilts constructed from the inspiration of oxymorons, innately contradictory phrases such as Clearly Ambiguous, Extinct Life, Silent Scream, Linear Curve, Icy Hot, Deafening Silence, and more. Each quilt's weaving embodies the riddle, and brings the subtle paradoxes of a common yet bizarrely meaningless phrase to life. With sketches and glimpses into the thought processes of the quilt designers, Oxymorons: Absurdly Logical Quilts offers a rare and recommended view into creative consciousness of quilt makers."
1,"Crib is okay, delivery was a nightmare!","The crib is okay. I ordered it for my daughter who is due to deliver in June, my first grandchild. One of the end bars had a crack in it. Some of the paint was scrapped off showing a small black/dark area that is approx. 1 inch square. There was another larger area where it looked like it had been scrapped off much worse and had been painted over. But as it took a hassle just to get the crib.....[...]After all that hassle, my daughter and brother drove to the ""unmanned"" station. A worker had just arrived there. When they followed the person into the ""container"" it was just a huge room with some tables for smaller packages. Nothing was 'sealed'. My daughter said that there were maybe 8-9 packages on the tables..total. My brother said the woman pointed to a lone package up against the wall and said...""I believe that might be your crib"". It was. Had it within 5 mins.[...]"
5,Super Value!,"I think this crib is an excellent buy! I was looking at the Pottery Barn sleigh crib which looks exactly the same, but is [more expensive], and happened to come across this one.It was so easy to put together. My six year old and I put it together in about 20 minutes. It's very sturdy, which was my major concern. I love the fact that it converts so my baby can use it through her toddler years. The style is great and very classic looking. I still can't believe that I found it for this price."
3,"Just Ok, don't expect to use it too long.","This bed is very attractive, but it is very wobbley. You can't lock the wheels, & sometimes I have to shift the entire bed frame to raise & lower the side rail. Also the release tabs for the side rails stick. I thought that it can be converted to a toddler bed, but is way too high at the lowest height. (the top of the mattress reaches at my thigh area) There are no toddler bed side rails that fit it either. Not even as a separate purchase. I bought this thinking I wouldn't have to get a toddler bed in the future, but here I am looking for one!Overall, it's OK. It looks good & functions good enough for an infant. Just don't expect to get any extended use out of it."
1,not sure it is safe,My daughter is 11 months old now and has gotten her leg stuck twice between the rails. I have had to use lotion to slide it back through. She has been hysterical both times it has happened and now I am afraid to use it. The casters fall off constantly and you need two hands to get the rail down. I had purchased the changing table originally but when I went to assemble it there were cracks in several places where the screws were to go. I did not want to mess with another one so just returned it. After my experience I cannot recommend this product.
1,Question?,"On the website details for this crib, it says Manufacturers age 6 months - 5 years, is this a typo? Because the tag on this crib at one of the babies-r-us stores says from birth. I tried calling the store to ask which is correct the website or the tag at the store and they referred me to Delta and were pretty rude. I tried calling Delta but they won't even talk to you without a model number. So, which is correct? I also tried finding a customer service number to call to ask about the comment on the website, but could not find one."
3,Not the greatest but not so bad...,"I am not a fan of the DeBeers, I didn't really like Willow and the whole thing with Palm Springs... but I like Hannah. Hannah had a lot of more of what a VCA gal should have, also Heyden was classically VCA/GW. He really reminded me of Logan from Casteel, not a fave of mine but at least believable. Willow was a sell-out in this book and fullfilled all the horrible things she stood up against in the other books and in her childhood.I also loved the Southern thing and think the Stanton's could have had a series of their own. They reminded me of the Adare's in a way I hope the GW brings more of that kind of magic and mystery back into VCA.I can't wait to read about Grace and hopefully Bunny too... all in all not too bad... way better than Summer."
3,"Is it just me, or are these books losing their sparkle?","I am a big V.C. Andrews fan, but i must say that the man writing under her name (yes, she is in fact dead) is really desperate for some new plot lines. It seems like the same thing happens in every book: young girl suffers bad family life, gets a boyfriend, has sex, someone destroys her reputation, she makes a big mistake, and then everything falls into place in the end. Well, it was good in the first couple of series', but it's getting old. This book was ok, not great, not horrid, but it just didn't have the same suck you in storyline as, say, the Landry series. Read it if you want, but it's nothing compared to Willow and Dark Forest (i think that's what it was called). So if you read it, you can pass some time, if you don't, you're not missing anything. It's the same story that he's told a million times."
4,Italian book,useful tool for learning Italian. I am taking classes at the Italian American Cultural Center.
3,The newest edition of Prego! released 8/2000,"As a former student, and now teacher of first year Italian at the university level, I found the previous editions of Prego! to be far superior than any other college Italian text available. I was, however, very disappointed by this edition and the number of mistakes and poor editing I found. Gone are the tables and charts which were so helpful. The literature sections are far too complicated for the beginner student. Had I been able to see this edition ahead of the deadline for ordering texts by begining of the semester, I would have seriously considered other options."
4,exactly what I need,The book was exactly what I ordered and exactly what I needed. This volume is very hard to get and indeed impossible to purchase new in Australia. It is a good textbook for people at higher than beginner level but not yet intermediate level of Italian proficiency to start with and work through it to improve proficiency. It is easy to understand and unlike a more popular series of texts here in Australia is not just written in Italian so it is simple to follow. I have been using it in class for almost 2 years and prefer it to the later edition although I would say if all I had was the 7th edition as opposed to the 6th I would probably find it just as useful.
3,"Not awful, but not perfect either","This is an alright text book. It does what it's meant to do. A person can learn Italian from this book as long as they are also in a class as well, but it definately has some flaws. One -it needs more examples of some of the more difficult grammar points. Two - the order is strange. Why did you start with avere? Somehow essere seems like a better place to start. And the chapter themes! They pretend that they have chapters arranged by topic, but it seems very haphazard to me. Also, several major grammatical topics are missing from this book, and as a result, many of my teachers have had to give us multiple hand outs to compensate. It's ok - but it could be a lot better."
3,Relaxing...Not Overly Stimulating,"I liked this book, but felt that there could have been more of a plot or story behind the town. All of the things that seemed like big mysteries didn't turn out to be that way. It was a nice peaceful story of a town that I would like to visit. However, that's all it was, and a little long to have no purpose."
3,at home in mitford,I really enjoyed father tim and his small town full of interesting chatacters. I did not enjoy the writing style used. I wished many times that there were less characters that we got to know a little bit more. I also did not care for the way the book jumped from scene to scene sometimes leaving me dazzed and confused whom we were talking about.
4,Very entertaining!,I picked up this book / series a few years back in paperback and I loved it. Father Tim is slightly quirky and very loveable..Now reading it on my Kindle...I still love it. The only thing slightly negative I can say is that it has a few slow spots. But overall..it is hard to stop reading..You get attached to the characters and find yourself wishing the book would not end.
5,At Home In Milford,Very Good. Highly recommended. Arrived on time. Great Characters.Would share his lovely book with others. Can't wait to read the other books in the series.
2,The nyquil of recent fiction,"I wanted to like this book. I like series, I like small town America, it seemed that this would be a perfect book to curl up with. I actually feel guilty that it just didn't grab me. The idea of a pastore in a town that feels hopelessly out of date sounds good, but Karon didn't quite pull it of. My biggest complaint is that it is boring. I just didn't care what happened. There was very little excitement, substance, or even plot to keep the story moving. It seemed that the general gist was that Father Tim wanders around town and then goes home. That's it. A disapointment."
2,At Home in Mitford,"Sweet series of books, but copied ... from the older Thrush Green books by ""Miss Read"", the English writer. Check them out on Amazon.com and decide for yourself."
1,Too sweet,"I was excited to read this book after hearing so much about it. I was sorely disappointed. The plot was transparent. I don't mind a page-turner, but this book totally lacked substance. It's not that I require blood and guts to be satisfied with a book, but this book was so saccharin-sweet that I needed to brush my teeth.One of the most annoying things was the author's method of writing dialog (""'at ol' dog..."") ... it was cumbersome to read. The way the rector kept quoting scripture was too contrived ... as if each day the author read a Bible verse and forced herself to incorporate it into the story.Beyond my distaste for the unbelieveable sitatuions, I did not think this book was written well (case in point, is the character ""Jena Ivey"" or ""Jenna Ivey"" ... we see it both ways)."
4,Love the Mitford books -- but can be slightly uncomfortable for a Catholic,"I love Jan Karon's Mitford books -- they're so well-written, so sweet and touching without being cloying, so laugh-out-loud funny at times, so full of sincere religious feeling without being heavy-handed. There's one thing I have to say, though -- as a Catholic, now that I've read most of her Mitford novels, I do feel a bit uncomfortable with the complete absence of Catholicism in Karon's Christian world. Maybe it's the setting in the South, but the fact that there are Christians who are Catholics is never, ever mentioned -- she has one minor character who's Jewish, but nary a Catholic anywhere. I wish she wouldn't leave us out completely -- her happy Mitford world is otherwise so inclusive, and now that I've realized it, it does give me an uncomfortable feeling that there might be some (perhaps unconscious?) anti-Catholic prejudice on the part of this wonderful author."
2,won't be buying the series,"Very slow reading. Not like the Remember, Redemption, Return series that I really liked. I could not relate to the characters, and the writing seemed scattered."
1,"A warm and fuzzy feeling, but not literature.","I'm a native of the area on which Mitford is based, and I can say that Jan Karon does no justice to the area. This novel was full of simple character types -- all from a white, middle-class background -- who don't resemble anyone I've ever met in my life. If you're looking for an escape from the real world, this may be it, but I'd recommend being white and fairly well-off (the only minority characters are stereotypical black ""mammies""), otherwise you're in for a long-winded trip through hell."
5,"Energizing, Fulfilling, Just Plain GREAT!","If you want to relax and put your worries away, read any (and all!) of Jan Karon's books. They challenge you to remember that there is good out there - and revive your Christian spirit. A sure-bet, can't miss read. Read ""Miss Fannie's Hat"" - or give to a child - heartwarming. The best around! I almost jumped out of my chair when I saw her latest coming in April - my book seller will be relieved now that I no longer will harass and ask for any information on a new release!"
5,A Gentle Read,"I've been interested in the reviews I've read, being in agreement with them most of the time. Those who complain about a lack of reality, etc., miss the point all together. There is enough so-called reality everywhere we turn. A reality of crudeness, selfishness, and disdain for anything gentle. Hooray for Jan Karon, and her wonderful world of Mitford. I have even missed my favorite TV shows (Law & Order, and CSI), for a few hours of delight in the pages of Mitford. Father Tim and all the rest have won my heart!"
3,A nice book,"At first blush At Home in Mitford can be somewhat boring. But as the pages went by, I felt myself liking it more and more. There was nothing overly special about the characters or plot or writing. Overall it kept my attention and I found it enjoyable. Basically, this is no great work of literature but a fine book to pass a rainy night. I can't quite put my finger on why I liked it but I did."
2,No! No! No! Don't Read It!,"I was actually looking forward to this selection of my reading group and planned to read the entire series. It was agony getting through this book - simplistic and dated language prevails. I kept thinking I was reading about a priest in the 1950's rather than the 1990's. In fairness, it had some nice moments, but there is not any depth to it."
5,"How Does One Top This Read -- Now, There's the Rub!!","I fell in love with Mitford and the characters therein. This book came along at just the right time in my life. Recent events in the news and the everyday hustle-bustle of life makes one want to escape to Mitford where life is as it should be. It is a wonderful, feel-good read and I fell in love with all the characters from Father Tim to dear ole Barnabus. At Home in Mitford is like a return to childhood when the days were simple and worries were few. I absolutely loved this book and am hurrying off to read the rest of the series. This is a book that remains with you the rest of your life."
4,Protecting my new Apple laptop from naturally oily fingers.,"Bought this new ProTouch Keyboard Protector for my MacBook Pro 17"" and it's been wonderful. I barely even notice it's there to the touch. Has a great fit over the keys. NOT bulky or too thick. Actually has great flex. I got the blue cover only because it was the only one available. My only suggestion would be to have more than that one color to pick from. Excellent item otherwise!!!"
3,The moral of the story....,A great little book. Not very complex characterization or plot but conveys an age old moral. This book is worth the short time it takes to read. (In the same vein as the The Old Man and the Sea)
3,a good book,"I read The Pearl in seventh grade and it was my favorite book for a long time. The mood of the book is one of tragedy and at times weighs heavily on you, but in doing so it skillfully conveys the emotions of the characters and the effect of the circumstances they find themselves in."
2,"Good moral, but couldn't relate to the book.",I liked the book but not that much. There was a good moral. I couldn't relate to the book so it made it harder to understand. I give The Pearl 2 out of 5 stars.
2,"Good premise, but a one-time read.","The premise and plot of The Pearl is excellent. The struggle of man against money and other man is a hard one, and this book brings it all out. However, the dialogue is very dry, and there's hardly any of it. The book is enjoyable in some parts, but only some, and you find yourself reading to finish it, not reading to actually enjoy the book. I have to give John Steinbeck some credit for expressing the thoughts and feelings of the characters through the music of Kino, but, bottom line, be glad its only ninety pages."
2,HEADWOUND,"This book seemed very passable to me. I had nothing but criticism for this book because i was honestly very dissapointed. The dialogue seemed very repetitive, with Kino continually saying,""The song of the [insert noun of choice here]"" throughout. It seemed very redundant. Also, the story dragged and I was just waiting for something big to happen the whole time. In my opinion, the only redeeming feature about this book was the moral. It maintained a good moral; Money can ruin you and your family. But honestly, i expected more than a fortune cookie moral out of John Steinbeck. Truly a dissapointment, and ultimately passable."
4,The Pearl by John Steinbeck,"As an eighth grade project, we're being assigned to read the pearl. So far, i think its a great book. (I'm not done)It's annoying me that so many kids in our class are complaining how hard and boring this book is. I would really love to slap them in the face. This book is incredibly easy and is about at a 9th grade level, and we are in horizons.Some are prejudiced against mexicans which is really sad seeing as i am half in my blood.I will not tell you anything about this book, only to just give it a chance. It's an easy read and once you understand the moral and theme it will come to you easier. happy reading!"
4,the pear,I would recommend this book to kids and students to read this book. Because its a advanture and sad story its explains how todays people are with to much power. I liked this book also because it was easy to under stand and read i dint have to much trubel to under stand some of the word the book had.
3,''The pearl'',This story is about a poor family who lived in a poor village in Mexico. It is about kino and juana and their son coyotito.kino find a pearl of the world and he made the song of the pearl. kino was poor and he wanted to sell the pearl but the pearl has become evil.''Did Kino sold the pearl or did Kino becomes a rich man at the end''?Reaction;I think this book is kind of intersting because Kino has found the pearl of the world. But what would he do with the pearl?
3,The pearl,"Kino was a poor fishman like his father and grandfather. Everythings is normal with his life having a wife and a baby. But one day with a bite from a scorpion, Coyotito almost dead. The greedy doctor won't see Kino's family. They have no choices but to search for the ""great pearl of the world"" for their son and their great future.But the pearl didn't bring luck or a great future like the legend said. It showed the greedy and the dark sides of humans. This preal broke their family apart. Kino could trust no one now. Everybody is an enemy in his eyes. The pearl had become his soul.This taught us not to be greedy. i recommed it to the high school students because it is a good lesson for us to learn."
3,The Pearl,"The Pearl was an okay book, although I would not suggest it to anyone who wanted to read. I did like certain parts of the book, and it taught good lessons about life. It also let me see the world through a different point of view than my own. My favorite character in the novella was probably Kino for his human characteristics. He had so little, yet he was satisfied with what he had. He was strong all through the book, although his wife, Juana, appeared to be stronger at times. The Pearl has sort of a mysterious plot, and sometimes it was hard to follow along with what was happening. I definitely did not expect it to end as it did, and I was somewhat disappointed and surprised in the end. It's not your typical Hollywood plot. The Pearl had a good moral, but I do not think I would suggest you to read it for enjoyment."
3,is it suitable for people of all ages?,"The Pearl is one of the literture book in school and definately, i enjoyed it. It's very expressive and is pretty easy to be understood. But, does people of all ages understands the book? That's another problem as Steinbeck uses slangs and he is very expressive. In one of the sentence in the book, there's a deeper meaning in it. That makes you think whenever you read a sentence to fully understand what Steinbeck is trying to explain. I like the book as it says about racism, about the ""blacks"" who are not treated fairly. That reminds me of ""To kill a mockingbird"" by Lee, Harper. He is very expressive, but, I m still not sure if people of all ages will understand the book. But, i would definately hope that they would so to allow more people to enjoy his book which was WONDERFULL!!!"
5,The Pearl E6L PM.,"This novela called ""The pearl"" by ""john Steinbeck"" is a story that talks about corruption,greed and ambition. This story take places in Baja California, Mexico in a little town called La Paz. This is ironic because it means peace and they don't have peace. The towns people just want money. Kino is a selfish man who found the ""Pearl of the World""and with this pearl he wanted to realize their dreams. But, his wife Juana wanted to throw away the pearl because she felt insecurity.Will kino sell the pearl? I recomend this book because it is a story about greed and you can see the problems of a poor family. I give to this book five stars because is interesting and I'm sure that if you read this book you can learn a lot of things about life."
1,Not worth reading,No one should pick up this book it is not worth 5 dollars nor is it worth 5 cents I wish I had never readit please by all means DO NOT READ THIS BOOK
3,"The Pearl, In The Spotlight","The Pearl, written by John Steinbeck, is set in Mexico. It is an exciting story of life and death. In a town where everyone is after money, and looks out for no one but those of their own. It's a town in which most people found pearls for a living, but some wear luckier than other.When a scorpion stings Kino's son, Coyotito, all hell emerges. With a doctor that won't heal anyone that doesn't have a bag of gold on him or her, and will come close to killing a child for money, it is hard to heal a son.I would recommend this book to anyone around the age of ten, eleven, or twelve who is looking for a sad, but exciting story. With its hundreds of twists and turns you may never be able to put this book down."
4,"Great Book, But Schools Ruin It","This is without a doubt one of those books that many of us had to read while going through school. For me I had to read this for a freshman year English class. I decided that I would re-read this book, because I knew I had enjoyed it. Without a doubt it is still on of my favorite books, but is by far one of the most depressing books that I've ever read.If you don't know anything about this book, it focuses on a husband that is also a pearl diver and how his life is impacted when he finds ""The Pearl of the World"". If you are looking for some happy reading, feel free to get a different book. But, if you are looking for a great classic and a story of light and dark, pick this up."
2,"One word, torture!","I've noticed that everyone else that read this was in like 6th-8th grade. I'm in 10th grade Honors English and I have to read it for a SUMMER reading assignment. So I believe I have it worse than any of u. The book was not at all interesting and it took me about a week to finish it b/c I could never sit down long enough to be that bored. If u are assigned to do a report on this book, beg ur teach to let u out of the assignment. I'm definitely not exagerating!"
4,"A good, short read","In The Pearl, John Steinbeck keeps the story very short. He doesn't waste words with filler, yet he provides thrilling images, complete details included. The concise, almost perfect word choices keeps the reader hanging on every word, no matter how near or far the plot is from the climax.The short-story, full of twists, turns, and heart-stopping suspense, is about a three-member family led by a poor pearl diver, Kino, in a Mexican community. After the young couple's baby child is bitten by a poisonous scorpion, the two do whatever they can to save the infant's life. A tale of struggle, surprises, and social discrimination takes the reader through the changing lives of this Mexican family. A great, easy read."
3,Too Much Like Real Life (not always interesting...),"The Pearl was an O.K. book. I thought that it had a few exciting scenes but a lot of it was fairly dull. One of the main reasons I did not like it was because it was too realistic. What I mean by this is that not everything in life is interesting. John Steinback may have wanted the book to be like that, but books that have such little dialogue and suspense do not fit into the category of books I like. Although it is boring in parts, The Pearl does have some lines that will stick in your mind when you finish reading. For instance one of the quotes from the book that I seem to remember is ""He hissed at her like a snake."" I like this simile because it really gives you an idea of how it would feel like to be Juana (the wife) seeing Kino (the man who found the pearl) standing over you. Altogether The Pearl is a book that people would read for a quick story or an assignment."
3,The pearl,"The Pearl by John Steinbeck is about a young indian man named kino, who lives with his family in a small village.Kino always dreamnt about finding a pearl that would change his poor life to a wealthy one.One day Kino's dream became ture, he found the ""pearl of the world"".Kino found that the pearl brought more evil to his family than good.To live out his dream, he must fight all evil that come against him.Even if it means taking his dream some where else.The Pearl by John Steinbeck really inspired me.It brought me to a reality that good things will come in its time.I really enjoyed reading The Pearl,because it taught me a lesson.No amount of riches would bring peace or happieness unless one has his family to share his wealth with.I found that the greatest gift is having a loving family.Nathaniel"
4,solved the problem !,the book came very late. more than 2 weeks ! though when I sent an email for them. They sent me another book immediately ! first class
3,The Pearl,"They had found the pearl of the worls. The pearl was huge. They had thought th epearl would bring theen riches, but it ended up bringing the family bad luck. The family turned greedy, and it caused the death of the baby coyotito. Tho stroy ends with the pearl being thrown back into the oceans, for the pearl brought bad luck.I like this book because the story interested me greatly. The stroy of the oearl was non lik others. It was very realistic, and the book was written very well/ It kept meh at the edge of my seat while reading it. The story was packed with action and suspense.I found the book at the library. The cover of the book showed a man and his wife, nad a baby in the ocean. The title The Pearl seemed very mysterious, When the cover page did not mathc the title, i was absu\olutely dying to find out what the title meant."
2,_The Pearl_,"I have read Steinbeck's ""Of Mice and Men"" so I started the book half-knowing what to expect. It took me about 10 pages before I got into the book. Even though it does not grab your attention from the start it gets it around the beginning.I don't like scorpions at all myself; so when the scorpion attacked I was in !!KNOTS!!. The whole time Steinbeck is talking about songs I'm wondering, ""What can the meaning of this be."" Indeed Steinbeck uses a lot of hidden meanings and foreshadowing in this novel.I was very disappointed in this book as in ""Of Mice and Men"". The story is fairly exciting but the ending leaves more to be desired. I felt like there was not very much of a good point in the story. Maybe in the meaning, but not in the story. I felt like I was walking in circles as I read this book."
2,Not One of his Better Works,"First of all, I am not putting down Steibeck, he has a lot of great works, unfortunately this isn't one of them. It really drags along at a snails pace. I appreciate the moral and lesson but I dislike how Steibeck decided to portray it. If you would like to read a great Steinbeck novel, pick up 'Of Mice and Men' or 'The Moon is Down'."
3,"English Exam, Thats ALL","Well how should I put this, the book was OK didn't really much appeal to me, although not many books really do. I don't recomend his book as it just drags on to much, I mean come on how many times does Kino actually get hit, killed, or beaten senseless, it went way off its head."
1,terriible,"this book is a complete waste of time, my life, and money. this book is so boring. i would rather count all the grains of sand in the world...i give this book a rating of -1000000000000000000000000000000000"
3,Teaches a good lesson!,This story shows how greed can take over a person's life. A fisherman finds a pearl. The evil from the pearl completely takes over his body. Read the book to find the outcome and important lesson that is taught.
2,BORING,he needs to develop on the plot. My first impression of the book was BORING.But if you are th boring kind of boring person then this sthe book for you.
1,A crummy parable glorifying poverty and ignorance,"John Steinbeck wrote several bad books (The Red Pony, Tortilla Flat, The Grapes of Wrath...), but this one just might be his worst. His message to the poor and ignorant: ""Be glad you're not rich and smart---money and knowledge are the root of all evil and only lead to misery, so take comfort in your community of poverty and ignorance!"" Leave it to a successful, well-educated ""humanist"" to write an absurd, contemptible little parable glorifying these things. It isn't even well-written (even for Steinbeck), and the story is truly ludicrous.At least Steinbeck wrote some good books too, books like Of Mice and Men, The Winter of Our Discontent, and East of Eden...pick up one of them instead."
3,Great discription; weak character development,"This book, as always, had those long detailed description to things. But really, there is no characteristic for each character, and not much development for each person. It was a short novel, if you really can't find something to read, maybe you can TRY read this one"
3,The pearl of the World,"In a far town,in Baja California there was a men whose name was kino.He was married with Juana and they had a little boy named Coyotito.They were very poor.They lived in a brush house,but one day their life changed.Coyotito was stung by scorpion.They didnt have money to pay the doctor to cure coyotito.Fortunately,he found a pearl,""The Pearl of the World"".How can a pearl help to change the life of someone.I give this book 3 stars because it was intresting but i really didnt like the end.If you like to read fiction books i recommend this book to you.The message of this book is ""Dont think that money is Everything""."
3,The Pearl,"I wouldn't call ""The Pearl"" a bad book. It is well-written, and Steinbeck effectively brings his point (what greed can do to you) across with this simple story.However, I have mixed feelings about it. It is written in the form of a parable, and this means that the story exists only for the sole purpose of bringing the point across. Like most parables/fables, the characters are 2 dimensional, and you can easily group most of them under the categories of ""Good"" and ""Bad"". This may put off some readers, who might find it rather boring. So if you want a more ""filling"" read, skip this.Three stars to be fair. After all, it's not that bad."
1,"For the price, I would expect better.","For the price, relative to other (non-name-brand) air gaps, I would expect better quality. The plastic body of the air gap is too thin, and when you try to tighten it to the sink, the body bends and the threads slip. In whole, not worth the price."
5,Vent cap,Received the item early and matched my faucet. Deliveried as advertised installed it right away perfect fit completed in 15 minutes
5,Quantum,"I haven't read a lot of science popularisers but I have to admit that this one beats all the others I've read (the 3 Brian Greene books and a brief History of Time). I enjoyed every page of this book. The thing that makes this book so great are the beautiful illustrations and the layout. They make reading the book so much more pleasant. Another thing I have enjoyed is that you also learn about the history of quantum mechanics. The book also offers great variation in the chapters. This book inspired me to study the mathematics behind Quantum mechanics. Even now I still sometimes read a few pages from this book, and I'm not someone who reads a lot. The only bad thing about the book is that it doesn't go deep enough into some topics. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in physics."
3,False cover,The cd cover pictured wasn't the same one I got. Music was okay. Got it cause it's part of a collection
5,Surprised at the great quality!,It even works on a 2006 Honda Accord despite Honda Accords being listed as one of the models that it won't fit perfectly. We drove our bikes from San Francisco to Napa without any issues. There wasn't even a rustle in the back!
4,Good Value,The rack worked perfectly for my bike with the one caveat that over long distances (300+ miles) there was mild slippage. This could have also been the result of the knots I tied.
4,2 bike trunk mount rack,Fits beautifully on my car. It comes in very handy when transporting our bikes from home to wherever we go to ride.
5,Just Installed,"Just installed a US spec Allen Model 102DB 2 bike rack on my 1986 Alfa Romeo GTV6. Loaded one bike so far, a Gunnar Rock Hound mountain race 29er, carbon fork, Avid disk brakes, 15 speed Shimano Deore XT gearing (bike weighs 22lbs). Bike and car looked good at 65 mph no bouncing (bike without Alfa tops out at only 30+). Allen fit list does not include Alfa models - so FYI."
3,Not As Secure As Thought,"At first, I was very leery about how secure this bike rack was. After loading my bike on it, I drove 30 miles and thought that the bike was pretty secure. When I got home, I looked and saw that the bottom strap had come loose from the bumper of my car. Regardless of how much I tighten the bottom strap, it still seems to move quite a bit and shift. When using the rack, I worry about that bottom strap. It does show an alternate way to secure the strap on the inside of the trunk. I have yet to try it out, but hopefully it will prove to be much more secure than on the outside near the bumper."
3,Be cautious if you have a spoiler,"Although the description says it fits most spoilers, this rack did not fit over the spoilers on an '02 Mustang or '05 RX8. I would guess that if you have a somewhat larger spoiler such as those on sports cars, this rack won't fit. Aside from the fit issue, the rack seemed sturdy enough and easy to install, but again I never got to try it out myself. I can say that the Saris Sentinel rack I ended up buying fits both cars."
4,Looks good.,"Product arrived on time in excellent condition. All parts were there. It assembled fine. Looks good. I have not had the opportunity to use it yet, but it looks like it will be fine."
4,Easy to install on vehicle,"It comes fully assembled. The only thing you have to do is snap the support pins in place (be careful I pinched my fingers everytime I do). The only thing I am concerned about is hooking the bottom strap to a plastic bumper that it will not hold. I can't seem to find a better place to hook it underneath my car.Just a word of caution, do not leave on vehicle when you take the bike off. It is easy to remove and someone might steal it. I recommend putting it in your trunk. It is only for temporary transport since you can not use your trunk with it attached.I haven't actually used it with my bike on it yet, so I can't say how stable it is yet, but when tightened securely it doesn't move."
4,"Good bike rack, could be just a smidge smaller","Just purchased and installed this rack on my compact sedan. It fits well but my trunk has a spoiler, and it's a little bit funky to adjust it because of that. The straps pull tightly.My only real complaint is that the because the frame of my mountain bike is a touch small, it's tough to get it on the rack easily. I think if the rack's two bars were 2mm closer together it would fit perfectly; as it is, I have to angle the bike to get one side of the top tube on, then wiggle the other side to get it to fit. Once attached, however, it stays on. As far as complaints go, though, it's fairly minor.I do recommend getting a couple of straps to secure the wheels, especially the front(I bought the SoftRide 26260 that at the time were part of the ""Frequently Bought Together"" package with this rack). If you don't, it seems like the front wheel bounces against the trunk every time you hit a bump or a turn."
3,Probably not what most people are expecting...,"This Bible appears to be a photographic reproduction of the Sacred Scriptures in Staroslav (Church Slavonic), authorised by the Holy Synod of Russia prior to the Revolution. Therefore, classical Staroslav Cyrillic is used for the text of the Bible -- as well as the old Russian numbering system (no Arabic numerals here, folks). If you aren't familiar with the old Cyrillic alphabet (or the traditional numeric system), it might be a bit difficult for you to use. However, I feel that it's a wonderful item to have, especially if you happen to be of Eastern European persuasion.The only problem I can find with the volume is that the printing could have been darker."
5,One of our favorites,I bought this for my daughter who we adopted from Guatemala. It is one of her favorite books to read at bedtime and I love it too! Perfect for any adopted child!
4,Expierenced Tarot Reader Gives 4 Stars!,"I own hundreds of tarot decks, including this one, it is a beautiful deck and I would highly reccomend it for people who have had alittle expierence. I wouldn't buy this if you are new to tarot, because the book can be quite tricky.. The set is beautiful and give wonderful spreads in the book.. (worth 5 stars for expierenced tarot readers.. only 4 for beginers) The book is rather large and quite detailed.. which can be misleading for some.."
5,WOW! WOW! WOW!,"I just finished listening to this CD and Mariah rocks! From the first moment I heard her beautiful voice singing ""Vision of Love"" I knew she was destined for greatness. 10 years later, listening to her greatest songs, confirms it. Mariah Carey is the most solid performer of the 1990's with hit after hit after hit. Buy this CD now and see for yourself. Not one song on this CD is bad, and you'll be singing and dancing right along with Mariah for 2 solid hours!"
5,Mariah is a star,"Mariah's Greatest Hits Album brings back good ole memories from the past. It is a good source of ballads for those moments for both an intimate evening with the one you love or just relaxing . She is a star like no other, she is my Whitney Houston."
5,A collection of Mariah's best!!,"This cd is a compilation of her greatest years as an artist-her years with Columbia, that is! There is so much more here than on Number 1's! For example, Can't Let Go, Forever, and Underneath The Stars, as well as other singles that weren't commercially released. This is great for any Mariah fan that wants all the singles without buying each and every album! It's too bad that this once incredible vocalist has gone downhill since she left her first record label. For all the complainers out there that gave one star because there's nothing new here: It's a Greatest Hits album!! What else did you expect?!"
3,Great,"Mariah's greatest hits. How can you go wrong. Not only beautiful and wonderful to listen to, I highly recommend this."
1,"Fly away birdie, far far away!","This CD collection is a huge disappointment. No new songs. All of her ballads are repititious and the dance tracks are forgettable. The only good song: um, there actually aren't any.Almost makes you wonder how she convinced people to buy her records in the first place. I think that once she became a ""butterfly"" and people got to know the really ""mariah,"" they realized there was no substance in her music, and she was just a piece of fluff. Some people may think i am too harsh,but the way she dressed in her Loverboy video, made her look like an unintelligent 2nd rate hooker.You have completely alienated your fans Mariah. You have treated us like we are stupid, and now you will be forgotten about, just like your greatest hits collection. Fly away birdie, fly fly away birdie, to another galaxy, bye bye!"
3,in between with Mariah,I think Mariah has a Good Voice&Talent but easily forgettable Music.for all Her Success&things Her Material is easily forgotten within a Year of it's release.She is Very Prolific but also Very Predictable as a Artist.for many Years Her first Single always reminded you of someone or a Song you have heard before&things are still in tact with that here.Her Voice gets Her over on alot of Hit&alot of Miss Material here.I think She has something Better down the Road if only She challenges Herself but this best Represents Her.we shall see.
4,The Awapuhi Suave Shampoo is a great product. ...,"The Awapuhi Suave Shampoo is a great product. I have long, dark auburn hair, and this shampoo gave my hair a nice, clean shine. Sometimes I have to blow dry my hair and it can feel brittle afterwards. With this shampoo, it stayed soft. I will definitely put this on my shopping list in the future. The top is easy to unscrew, though, so those with curious toddlers would probably need to put the bottle out of reach."
3,I would have to say that overall I ...,"I would have to say that overall I was satisfied with Suave Awapuhi Shampoo. I thought the shampoo cleaned my hair and rinsed away cleanly. However, my husband thought it left a residue in his hair. We did both enjoy the light scent of the shampoo. The scent was not overwhelming or perfumed like other shampoos we have purchased. My only major compliant is the bottle. I packed it with us when our family went out of town. I am glad that I had placed in a plastic bag as the lid did leak a little."
5,LOVE IT,This is one of my all time favorite movies. I saw it a week ago and totally fell in love with it. I'm hoping Amazon gets a new shipment soon because I want to buy it SOOO bad.
4,Saturday Night Live Skit,This is vintage Saturday Night Live. Corny but funny and I love the music. There are cameo roles by many famous singers and actors like Ray Charles and Carrie Fisher.
5,My Favorite Movie Ever,"I love this movie. It is graced by the presence of Aretha Franklin and James Brown. It has great music, and is hillarious and funA CLASSIC!It's 105 miles to Chicago. We got a full tank of gas, half a pack of cigarettes, it's dark, and we're wearing sunglasses"
1,WON'T PLAY - ruining a great movie,"Amazon should send all of these 25th Anniversary DVD's back to UNI, the faulty product locks up after about 1 1/2 hours on both my Panasonic and Sony DVD decks! I see this problem also exists in the wide screen version from the reviews of that product.Simply put - DON'T BUY THIS LOUSY UNIVERSAL PRODUCT!!!!"
1,Won't play correctly . . .,"Unfortunately, this dvd was a dud. Not the movie itself . . . the dvd kept skipping and freezing up. Will be returning it for replacement."
3,I want the original version!,"I love The Blues Brothers. This is one of the all-time great comedies; a truly epic comedy. In it's original form, it is flawless from beginning to end. Five Stars easily.Unfortunately, this ""Special Edition"" dvd includes 15+ minutes of scenes. Not under a ""deleted scenes"" section, which would have been appropriate and very welcome, but inserted into the movie itself. To be fair, the extra footage doesn't really hurt the music scenes. But did we really need to see Elwood at his place of employment? Did we really need to see where the Blues-mobile is stored when not being driven? None of the extra footage adds anything to the movie. In fact, it really ruins the perfect pacing of the regular cut.I truly hope Universal sees the error of their ways and reissues this film on DVD with the original cut. They could even make the added footage viewable within the movie, through seamless branching, but for the love of Pete, give us the option!!!"
4,This movie is a classic,"I love this movie. It is a classic comedy. I purchased this DVD specifically because it's formatted in Anamorphic Widescreen for 16x9 tvs (I hate buying an older movie only to pop it in and find that its got big black bars around all sides and a little picture in the middle of the screen). Overall, the movie is great. Picture quality is ok, nothing exception. There are some special features (deleted/extended scenes, interviews with the cast, etc). The only thing that bothers me is that the deleted scenes are added right into the movie. There's no option to watch them or not. After being used to the original movie, it makes watching it a little strange, especially since some of the scenes feel out of place with the flow of the film. Overall, its not too bad. There's really only a few of them in the movie. I just wish I had the option to watch it with or without the added scenes."
5,We're on a mission from God!,This movie is a riot. I've watched it a number of times and it still cracks me up. It's slapstick at it's best. I think it was Belushi's finest piece of work. It's definately a movie you want to keep in your collection. The bonus features are an added touch. It's a series of interviews relative to the film and it's people. A tribute to the talent on the old Saturday Night Live.
5,Timeless Classic,"This movie is an amazing classic and is worth your time on you big fancy TV. It has lots of rewatch value and is amazingly amusing.There's outlaws, police chases, screwing people over, misunderstandings, and a mission from god. There's also guns and girls and dancing, what more can you want out of a movie?"
3,"Love this movie, but...",the reel they transferred it from had some damage that wasn't corrected during the transfer process. This film would have gotten five stars from me it the film was in much better condition.
2,worse than I ever could have imagined,"I liked Animal House, and I thought John Belushi was funny in everything I'd seen. Then I saw this SNL abortion.Let me preface this with a disclosure: I hate musicals. But more of a problem is that I hate corny cliched screenwriting and flat, bland dialogue. No amount of shopping mall car chases can make up for a script with the sense of humor of a cat related inspirational plaque-owning Midwestern housewife.On to the music: Ray Charles, James Brown, and Aretha Franklin are some of my favorite R&B; artists. But I am not interested in seeing them sing long, awkwardly placed musical numbers that confuse the plot and slow the pace to a handicapped crawl.This movie was a waste of torrent bandwidth. WatchNational Lampoon Animal House 29th Anniversary EditionorCaddyshackinstead."
4,On doctrine and church order,"This is a excellent work, but it only focuses on the development of doctrine and church official structure (the story of their definition is summarised with concision, interpretation being reduced to a minimum, and with themes often split between different chapters).Because of that, the book is a heavy reading."
5,Compliments your Bowflex!!,"This books has helped be greatly. I purchased a Bowflex and was not quite sure what to do with it. This books really outlines a plan that you can follow and it has been three weeks and I can already see results. The author of this book, Dr. Darden, is a Bowflex expert since he works for the company that makes bowflex. He has worked out using all types of equipment, so I know his opinion has merit. Also, if you need to ask him a question, you can e-mail him and he does respond. Great Book!"
1,What's So Special?,"There was nothing Revolutionary about this book! It was a fast way for Darden, and Bowflex to make a buck if they were even able to do so with this ""Watered Down"", waste of good paper!"
3,"Agree's Swimmers Solution Shampoo plus Conditioner is, in ...","Agree's Swimmers Solution Shampoo plus Conditioner is, in my opinion, an average product in the swimmers shampoo line. I found the shampoo to be a little too watery and too much came out when I tried to use it. The bottle is shaped so that it slips easily out of your hands (not a good thing when you're in the locker room's shower facilities). But I think that the cleansers did work and my hair had no grimy swimming feel to it after using this product. But all in all, I'd buy Ultra Swims Swimmers shampoo over Agree's brand."
2,"Small, low-resolution photos, too wordy","This book has too much wordy text that takes too long to get to its points (if any.) The exercises are illustrated with very small, low-resolution blurry black-and-white photos that show little or nothing about the fine points of proper form in doing the movements involved. You can find the same info covered elsewhere just as well or better and illustrated more clearly.Bottom line: there's added value in dumbell workout but this book doesn't help much, if any."
4,Great book for beginners,I bought this book because I was looking to mix up my current dumbbell workout. I had finished P90x and have been sticking with dumbbells for 90% of my weight training. This book is great for the beginner but the advanced person may find it lacks information.
5,Well Though Out,"This is a well thought out book. The author talks about the advantages disadvantages of using dumbbells for strength training. So many people go right for the ""big weights"" and don't take the time to understand the science and art of creating a better body. He takes the time to go over each body part and its significance. He keeps it simple and straight to the point. A great book to ad to your collection."
3,There are better books out there,A visually unattractive guidebook that shows only well known workout routines. There simply are better alternatives to this guide. At least it is cheap though and it does seem to have the correct descriptions.
4,Looks like the picture,This pendant looks just like the product picture. It is a nice size and is a medium blue with touches of pyrite and calcite. The dolphin on the bail makes for an interesting touch.
2,The Pornography,"A pornography which portrays in picture, an embarrassingly, feature of the daughter of the future president of the United States comes alive when a secret Agent such as Mark Kirkland receive an instruction on an assignment to locate and retrieve the three copies of the pornographic films. His mission must remain a top secret, His quest leads him to the depths of Bavaria where he finds Soviet agent, Malik, and however, sidekick Lu Silk is also more anxious and rather interested in the whereabouts of the films. Who will find them first? And once found, who's to say they won't immediately disappear again? The book is a brain storming season for crime lovers, it portray a special suspense for book lovers, the scene has a beginning but by the time you must have closed the last pages, you will be grumbling for the end of the drama but you might by sad to find none, because the drama continues even as the pages ends."
2,Less Clear and Less Profound,"This book is a groundbreaking book; however, I did not enjoy it as much as other books by Arendt. I believe that some of its arguments are flawed. However, I do not doubt Arendt's talent or sincerity in the presentation of her ideas."
2,The Origins of Totalitarianism?,"This book nicely discloses the ghost of Heidegger in much of Arendt's writing. In short: forget your 'banal' bourgeois 'jobholder' worries about material things! leave issues of redistribution or poverty to the animals! instead, stick your toga on, leave the slaves and wives indoors and ... let's do manly politics! Arendt should have ditched this hyper-masculinist, romantic Grecophilia after it got us to Auschwitz. Go read Hobbes or Montaigne if you seek a far more humane perspective on life after human carnage (in their 'bourgeois' determination to keep romantic-mystical yearnings out of the public sphere). Physically, this book just about slips inside Arendt's larger monograph on the origins of totalitarianism. I fear it is ultimately where it belongs."
1,Absolute Trash,This is the stereotypical piece of literature that someone says they like because they think it makes them appear smart. Do not make the mistake of buying (or buying into) this piece of junk. Reading it actually makes me ill.
2,NOT ANOTHER TEEN MOVIE!,"At this time, we all should know what a teen movie is.That predictable pink and stupid piece of...art.But, Hey!, i'm not saying all teen movies are bad, but this one it is.High School, Ryan(Shane West) is in love with the most popular girl, called Ashley.Her boyfriend(Chris)is in love with Shane's best friend, Maggie(Marla Sokoloff).So they help each other to get what they want, whatever it takes.The acting is good, specially by Shane West.They all do good the stupid high school kid rol.This movie has some funny moments, like the Titanic parody in the schooll prom.Or the girls locker room, and some more.But what i didn't like was MARLA.She's so bad acting and her character was so stupid, I mean, who is like her in real life.Sorry, didn't mean to offen you.Well, let's wait for the next teen movie and let's see the differences, hope to be better than this one."
1,Worst product ever,"Bought it as a moisturizer at a local Walmart, it smells like plastic nothing even close to cocoa butter, it is greasy and i feel like i am applying machine oil on my skin. It is a total waste of money!!"
2,I hated them all,"Watching Robert Downey Jr. try to seduce Mike Tyson is worth the purchase price alone, but only just. The appropriation of black hip-hop culture by privileged white teenagers should prove interesting ground for storytelling, but James Toback's film is undermined by the lack of even one likeable character. It's very hard to care about the motivations or destinies of people you hate. Maybe that's the point? If so, fine, but it still doesn't make for a very substantial film. Two pleasant surprises amongst the trifling vignettes: Ben Stiller can be convincing outside of trash comedy, and Claudia Schiffer can act."
4,A unique examination of race relations,"It's the rare film that takes such an ambitious view of race relations. I've always been a fan of James Toback's work, and the themes he's chosen to explore really are condusive to his skills as a director. His writing is sharp, if a bit messy at times, and his hand with actors is sure. This is one film where things are not as simple as, well, black and white. The world Toback illustrates is one where races prey off one another, in a synergistic relationship that he argues might be necessary for survival. A very worthwhile film."
1,ANOTHER MOVIE WITH NO POINT,THIS IS JUST ANOTHER STUPID MOVIE WITH NO POINT ALL IT IS IS JUST A BUNCH OF IGNORENT NI$$AZ ARGUING AND CURSING AT EACH OTHER IT WAS SO STUPID.
2,"Great intent, delivery falls short","This film did not live up to my expectation. It lacked a much needed authenticity. I found the flow of the movie to be choppy and inconsistent. The subject matter is begging to be explored; this movie only exploited it. At the end, I was left feeling teased and unsatisfied."
2,Sony is great but the Ipod interface is BAD!!!,Very dissapointed with the Ipod selection screen. Im swapping this for the Fusion unit which has a scroll wheel and feels just like the Ipod. Also it won't take you two hours of clicking the next button to get to the T's in the ipod....
3,Disappointing,"I bought this with such high hopes since these two were my favourite dancers.Charlotta's chatty , giggly , manner of teaching began to grate on mynerves. There are far better DVDs out there ."
5,Yummy,"I didn't really know what coffe ""crema"" was, but I thought I would try it. It's very good... kind of an above-average strength coffee with a bit of foam on top. Since I drink my coffee with cream and sugar, the foam goes away upon stirring... but that's okay with me. I like the flavor of the coffee. I'm really loving my TWO Tassimo machines (one at home and one at my office.) This variety of drink is probably my favorite among the coffee selections."
1,Unfortunately...,"... Columbia-Tristar had an opportunity (really, an obligation to its movie-going and disc-buying audience) to remedy 30+ years of pan&scan broadcast/tape versions of CASTLE KEEP -- which was originally exhibited in 2.35:1 Panavision, contrary to what another reviewer here remembers -- and have instead elected to preserve a p&s presentation for the DVD release of this excellent and important Vietnam-era film (set during WWII). Whose bright idea was this? A one-star disc -- if I could give it no stars, I would -- for a five-star film? Thanks, Columbia-Tristar, but no thanks. I'll pass."
1,Massive amounts of shame on Columbia,"No need to buy this DVD, a Panavision title released in pan & scan? Yep, we're back in the stone age.Columbia pictures should be ashamed, heaping this crap on the public,the movie is no classic, but it's worth a look, but this transfer is awful. At least you get the opening credits in letterbox ;)"
1,Do not buy this book.,"In short, this book sucks! Instead I suggest you buy: ""How to Tune and Modify Engine Managements Systems"". It's a shame they don't have a ""0 star"" ratings."
5,Politics for Today,"This movie still speaks mightly about how our government is still run today. It is a movie that does speak of truth winning over wrong. It also show how naive the general public is when it comes to our legislators.Jimmy Stewart had another classic in Mr. Smith Goes to Washington. He plays his parts genuinely, and this is another best for him."
5,A timeless film still significant today,"A senator unexpectidly passes away which calls for an appointment of a new one, Jimmy Stewart who plays Jefferson Smith, the leader of a boys camp in his smalltown home. Jeff is overwhelmed by his new position so his mentor, Thomas Paine, who is also a senator, tells him to make a bill. Jeff, with the help of Miss Saunders writes up a bill for a new boys camp in his home state only to discover a corrupt plan in the United States government to turn individual profit. Jeff must do everything in his power to stop this plot, can he do it? A significant film during these times of economic crisis."
5,This is one movie I could watch over and over and over,"I only saw this movie for the very first time this week and I have to say that it is already my most favorite Jimmie Stewart movie. I, too, think that his performance was absolutely stellar. I could see that he had great talent in him early on and he should have won the Oscar. Unfortunately, his youth probably what worked against him. In any event, so much better than in The Philadelphia Story, since I saw the two movies back to back."
3,False Advertising,"The problem was not the movie - which is great - but that I ordered the colorized version. The cover is colorized, but even on the back of the movie it says ""Black and White."" I watched it this way, but can't figure out how to write to anyone at Amazon to complain without sending it back, unopened. I've gotten lots of good stuff from Amazon, but this is the second classic movie I've gotten that had issues."
3,Somewhat disappointed,"The reason I wanted this, so you can see the Lord's prayer in the middle, you really cant see it that well. The necklace is pretty itself, but the whole idea I chose this was so you could see the Lord's prayer, would not recomment this to anyone."
4,Lord's Prayer Pendant,The service I received from this company was great. I received this item just in time for Mother's Day. The presentation of the box was beautiful. The pendant was a little smaller than I had expected but it was still very pretty.
2,Mine was dated 2005 too.,"The battery I received was dated 2005 also. I hope this was just the label date, and not when the battery was made."
4,Island Musice,"Loved the music and not used to performer announcing each song. Otherwise, it was enjoyable and took me back to the islands."
2,"Not too bad, but not real good either...","This is a pretty good book for showing the derivation of formulas, but it doesn't spend enough time explaining the concepts. Also, it has good examples for simple problems, but needs examples for the more complex problems. Also the ""questions"" section at the end does not provide answers, which makes them totally useless as a learning tool."
1,Do Not Buy This CD,"I've bought this blank audio cds from Costco. Try to burn them from my Itune music library, I've burnt 12 cds, only 2 of them works, the rest 10 went bad, and no longer usuable.I've burnt 1000 cds in the past before with several brands, few went bad, but not this ratio of failure like this Sony cds.One star is too much actually.Save your money, and buy other brands."
1,"Don't buy these, they don't work",I brought these CDs for my guitar lessons. My instructor records my lessons on to the CD. We could not get these CDs to record. My instructor had stated that another student had the same problem with the Sony CDs. These may work great on your computer but not in the application described above.I'm going back to Memorex.
3,CD-R Music,"It works very well on TASCAM CDR4U! However, it does not work with Philips CDR-760 CD Recorder. So just be careful when using this Digital Audio CD with consumer quality CD recorders."
4,very applicable,"The information contained in this book are aligned to what is newest in dealing with changes. This book brings a series of tips that can and, in many cases, should be applied in practice.The book presents a readable and easily accessible, which makes it even more interesting. I recommend for anyone wishing to carry out organizational changes, even simple they may be."
4,Excellent one volume overview of the Commonwealth Enfield No#4 & No#5 and their accessories..,Excellent one volume overview of the Commonwealth Enfield No#4 & No#5 and their accessories.Very Well worth the price..The whole series on Enfields are a great source of information..
1,Questionable research!!,"READ THE BOOK....THOUGHT THERE MIGHT BE SOMETHING NEW WHICH I DIDN'T KNOW HERE... HOWEVER, AS A MEMBER OF THE ACTORS STUDIO MYSELF, IT'S LUDICROUS THAT JIMMY ""...KNOCKED BACK A FEW BRANDIES..."" BEFORE HIS AUDITION FOR ENTRANCE INTO THE ACTORS STUDIO. IN ACTUALITY, JIMMY HAD A FEW BEERS, WHICH HE USED FOR HIS SCENE...AS TOLD TO ME BY AN OLDER MEMBER WHO KNEW JIMMY, AND WAS THERE THEN, AND WHO IS A FRIEND OF MINE.THINGS LIKE THIS ARE ALL OVER THIS BOOK...SOMETHING LIKE THE TRUTH BUT NOT THE ACTUAL TRUTH...IF YOU WANT TO READ SOMETHING LIKE WHAT HAPPENED, READ THIS...BE AWARE THAT THE AUTHOR WAS EXCEEDINGLY SLOPPY IN HIS RESEARCH!!!"
4,Works well,We purchased the Adams Knife Tray about 2 years ago to organize our collection of kitchen knives. The tray is well made and can take a wide range of knives. Its best features are: 1) Knives are always in the same place 2) Knives are protected from touching each other and dulling the blades 3) Knives are hidden in a drawer rather than on the counter in a knife block. Overall very satisfied.
2,Long on tech short on Tao,"Ang spends a lot of time talking about lenses, cameras, film, etc. and not much time talking about Tao. As a result the book is rather dated (especially comments like, ""You can think of digital cameras as being a little like the fast-food of photography."") His photos are Camera Club OK, but leave you asking, ""If this is what Tao did for Ang, does it have anything to offer me?"" If you want an introduction to Tao and photography, buy Tao of Photography: Seeing Beyond Seeing by Philippe L. Gross, S.I. Shapiro."
3,"It's not all wrong, but it's not all right either","When a rising young conductor's career stalls in mid-flight, it's due to recordings like this one. The young American Adnrew Litton was British cased before he got is present appointment in Dallas, but despite glowing encouragement from The Gramophone, there's no hiding that this is a mediocre reading of the Mahler Fourth. Litton must love Mahler; he's recorded a lot of it form Dallas. But he has no natural feeling for Mahler's idiom. Rhythms are heavy, phrasing clumsy. Noting is a disaster, and the Royal Phil., which has become the step-child of London's orchestras, plays nicely. Mahler wihtout eloquence, however, simply doesn't register on the scales. The finale is takne at a relaxed walking pace, and Ann Murray--a rare mezzo in the vocal solo--brings heartfelt warmth to her part. even so, Litton has little feeling for the innocence and wonder of this movement. In all, a medium-good Fourth in a crowded field."
3,"Where is the ""Fox Grandeur"" Widescreen Version?","This is a film that really deserves to be seen in its widescreen glory. This is truly an epic film. However, I feel compelled to point out that the version that is available on this DVD is not, in fact, a ""cropped"" version of the film. The movie was actually filmed in three different versions. The first two, featuring the original cast, were the widescreen ""Fox Grandeur"" version and the version available here, shot in the Academy Standard ratio, which allowed the vast majority of cash-strapped theaters (they couldn't afford the special equipment for widescreen projection) to exhibit the film. The scenes in this version were blocked appropriately for a standard film of this era. The third version, shot concurrently, was a German edition using German actors in medium and close shots and footage of John Wayne and company in the long shots."
3,Still ANOTHER version,"Just thought I'd add to all the talk of different extant versions of this film. The Key Video VHS from 1988 offers yet ANOTHER incarnation of this film. As opposed to the edited 35mm version on Fox VHS and DVD, the Key version was a pan and scan version of the 70mm film, and ran 121 mins., even though the box listed it as 110."
5,it's a filter,fits perfect and works perfect in my 8 cup chemex. much more durable than the metlitta filters which are much thinner.
5,Chemex Coffee Filters,"The Chemex system is elegant, simple and quick. It makes great coffee. The Chemex Filters are at the heart of the system. They are some 20% thicker than other drip filters, and leave no grounds behind. The coffee stays in the filter long enough to make a great cup of coffee. It's hard to find, except on line, but worth it.Chemex Pre Folded Circle Coffee Filter"
2,Tastes Like Paper,"I have used about 40 or so of the unbleached filters (the brown ones) so far, and have found it to exude a paper-like taste that really seems to take away from the otherwise clean finish of the coffee. I have tried to remedy this unpleasant taste by rinsing it through with water before putting the ground coffee in it. Alas, this did not work. I've tried to rinse it under water a bit longer hoping this would also eliminate the taste. No success. I'm going to try the bleached filters, which I hope will allow me to appreciate the goodness of a Chemex cup of coffee."
1,an awful paper taste,"I am not sure whether the problem is with the product or with the particular batch I purchased, but coffee made with the unbleached filters is absolutely awful, infected with a foul paper taste. Rinsing the filter in hot water and letting it sit overnight reduces the paper taste but does not eliminate the problem. I cannot recommend this product."
1,CEO greed in America,The book is a good example of CEO greed in America. You will discover how Lou legally stole hundreds of millions from IBM at the expense of the poor IBM employee at the bottom working his/her [tail] off.
4,Who says Elephants can't dance?,"I always wonder how did IBM turnaround from the brink of death. I enjoyed the book very much. I have no doubt that Gerstner is a great leader and a very capable man, however, I couldn't help in thinking what the outcome would be if there were not so much talents and resources inside the company. Who had said ""circumstances, cicumstances!"""
3,Could have been so much better,"I wasn't surprised by the admission that IBM consisted of multiple fiefdoms with little communication between segments. I respect the man for what he accomplished, but there was so much more insight that could've been added. He should've used a ghost writer."
5,Business Poetry,"Mr. Gerstner poetry lies in his direct, simple, and precise way to frame the challenges he faced at IBM, on the measures taken by him and his leadership team, as well on a selfless and honest assessment of their results.I'm a manager far away in the corporate ladder from the perch where Mr. Gerstner's perspectives comes from. Regardless, my copy is full of marks that I'm now trying to distill into lessons that I will use to assist me in my leadership challenges.One of the most salient points addressed by Mr. Gerstner is that of belonging. Can someone ever be an insider at a company like IBM? Can someone ever be an insider at a company like mine (less than 200 employees)? It seems to me that, according to Mr. Gerstner, it does not matter; what really matters is to have compentency, passion, commitment, and the wish to win."
4,Great Book,"This book was a fantastic read, fantastic strategy analysis and provided many valuable management related decision making.High quality book!"
5,"Gerstner wins with experience, insight, creativity, guts","Gerstner's drastic changes may have disrupted the lives of many employees, but far more would have suffered if IBM had continued down the road to dissolution he diverted it from. In this book Gerstner distills his insights into modern business imperatives in a clear, readable, lively style open to the vast majority of us citizens who do not subsist on electrons and silicon chips."
2,May not be for the uncoordinated,"I thought this would be a fun workout & was excited to try it. However I'm not a dancer & not the most coordinated, there were moves in this video where I stopped & just stood there watching the girls (& guy) move - I ended up stopping in the middle of the workout and doing a different video. I will try the video at least 1 more time, maybe 2 and then decide if it is for me. I just dont think I will be able to get the moves down, which is too bad b/cause it looks like fun."
3,Hard to follow at first,"I've played it 3 times and it's a little hard to follow at first, the instructor goes right into her moves, I'm sure I'll get the hang of it, but at first, it's hard to keep up."
2,Oh Crunch. Le sigh.,"I'll be honest, I have not even tried this workout. It looked cheesy when I watched the preview here on Amazon, but I bought it anyway because I love Jennifer Galardi so much. I own almost all her DVDs and I've loved all of them. I don't know what it is about Crunch, but they somehow managed to make me want to strangle her.Whenever I get a new workout DVD, I preview it before I try it to get a feel for what's coming. With this, I could barely stand to fast forward through it. Everything about Crunch is just big and corny and somehow Jennifer sucked that energy in too and I couldn't even stand listening to her. The dance moves looked like the would have given my big butt a good workout, but I just couldn't bring myself to do it. I threw it back in the box and put on Jennifer's Sweating Sexy.I don't know what it is with me and Crunch, but we just don't click."
1,fat burning? dance video?,"I didn't even sweat, I bought this dvd thinking I was going to burn some calories, but nothing. As an instrutional dance video it was ridiculous (basic steps from the 80's). There's a salsa section OMG, that's is not salsa, not cha cha, of beat totally!"
4,"Lost Horizon, a classic found","I had seen this movie when I was in school, we read the book and then watched the movie. I loved it then and I love it now. Thanks to the company who worked to restore it."
3,Idealistic View,"Lost Horizons deals with an idealistic view of man. The movies look and feel are dated, but the ideas are not. The movie proceeds at a slow pace, but gradually sucks the viewer in to its' utopian view. Directed by a legend (Frank Capra) and showcasing Ronald Coleman and Jane Wyman. Most young people probably do not have the patience for the movie, but people over 60 will remember the actors and director and perhaps the concept of Shangri La."
1,Huge disappointment,"We've had loads of fun and lots of learning with my daughter's Leap Pad and various books. I thought this would be a great learning tool for digestion with the same caliber of intelligence as the Mammals and Geography books. This was a huge disappointment with very little information regarding digestion and explained in very dumbed down terms. It seems the book was geared more towards the whiney kid in the story and silly bodily function sounds than in educating about digestion and/or nutrition. The games are pointless and interaction is minimal. My daughter spent a total of 10 minutes on this book and hasn't picked it up since, where she plays with her other leap pad books over and over and finds something new or engaging each time."
5,Breathe easy,"Looks identical to the original Toyota filter at half the cost. Be carefull not to accidently disconnect any hoses when you lift the filter cover, if you do your check engine light will come on a day or two later and will go back off a few days to a week after hose in corrected. Your car will breathe easy with a new filter installed."
3,fits well although feels poor quality,"lacks a frame around the filer. although it fits my toyota, it doesn't look at all like the original part. not sure if will hold up well."
4,If you like your blues RAW...,"... and unpolished, this collection is for you. Nothing slick here, just the real stuff. Nineteen fairly obscure tracks in a wide variety of styles from a wide variety of artists, some familiar names, some not so. Some acoustic, some electric; some solo, some groups. This is what some people (not me) call ""honest"" blues. Worth a listen. Recommended for true blues fans only."
1,Another lackluster Mac effort from Intuit.,"When I asked the customer service rep (CSR) when they were going to attempt feature parity with the PC version, he told me they put so much effort into getting it to look right that there was no room for: cash flow analysis (how hard would this be?), FedEx and UPS shipping, auto logs, and too many more things to list. The CSR said there were ""a lot of thngs the PC version would do that the Mac version would not do. Payroll is another application that some reviewers have said would never post properly to QuickBooks. Other reviewers mention lack of online banking features.I have used MYOB Account Edge(Mac) for years and it is a good application, but it ages differently than Quickbooks, and I am tired of fighting (and paying) my accountant over that. My copy of QuickBooks Mac is going back and I am taking my accounting functions over to the dark side."
1,Rebate is phony,The terms of the rebate aren't listed here but once you get the pakage you will see in the fine print that it is only for people who are UPGRADING from a previous version of QuickBooks.
4,Excellent timer,"I'm not sure why this one and the black one have gotten bad reviews especially since the other colors have mostly good reviews, but I had this timer and it worked great. I found both the time and the timer easy to set. If you hold it one way it's a clock and if you flip it upside down it becomes a timer. Very useful! The only con about this is that the light is not that bright, but I honestly did not use the light much. A battery exploded in mine and damaged mine which is why I am seeking a replacement."
3,"Nice looking, but the paint...","This little knife looks really good. I bought the black version, but with very little effort and without having used it for its purpose, the black painting started to be removed. Too bad for such a nice looking and potentially useful knife."
4,Beautiful Men,"David Vance's TIMELESS is quite a mixed bag. On the one hand, the book's quality is astonishing. The pages are beautiful and crisp; the quality of the black-and-white photo-transfer is beyond words.Yet the images are exceedingly uninspired and become, after a while, quite repetitive. In my opinion, the cover photograph is the best; kudos to the publishers for placing it on the dust-jacket.The men captured by Vance in these photos are indeed beautiful; almost all are fully- or semi-naked: the poses (as well as facial expressions), however, do not tend to range, and soon become tedious to look at.Nothing special or overwhelming in terms of Vance's artistic vision (some of the images are actually rather kitschy); but a nice coffee-table book nonetheless."
3,Nice looking book..,"The quality of the photos and the actual pictures are pretty good, BUT I would have to say that if your looking for erotic photos, you won't see many in here.The book is nice, the pics that are in it are good, but it's a PG-13 photo book basically."
3,A 'Screwed-Ball' Comedy,"One of the silliest, dumbest, and lamest movies in recent years, but the cast elevates this film to a funny and somewhat charming pic. Norm McDonald, sorry to say hasn't found the right vehicle to match his comic talents, is a stitch as a overworked underappriciated gopher type for a greedy, nasty 'stitch' of a woman. He comes up with a plan to kidnap her dog, which turns into his own kidnapping which turns into...well it keeps turning and rather cleverly. Yes, this movie is lame at times, and clever at times. All the cast is top notch. Good belly laughs to be had at all."
2,Timbalaye.... Original !,"Algunos tienen la suerte de haberlo escuchado ya, otros no hemos podido ni verlo.. ojala se nos dé la oportunidad.. ya que un buen fan.. debe estar actualizado con el artista favorito.. en este caso Luis Enrique.... suerte con este nuevo trabajo... y sigue adelante.. espero escuchar salsa bien escrita e interpretada en este trabajo..."
3,"with realistic expectations, you will enjoy this book","Mr Philbrick's 'In The Heart Of The Sea' was a gem. 'Mayflower' is a diamond in the rough that never quite achieves the same luster. It is certainly interesting and can hold your interest but somehow it is flat. If you have an interest in the subject, or in correcting falsehoods in our glorified history then you will enjoy this book. If you were a fan of 'In The Heart Of The Sea' and are looking for the next Philbrick book to captivate you like that, then you may be disappointed. Read it, enjoy it, just dont expect to be blown out of the water."
3,Interesting & Informative,"Mayflower is written in an easy-to-understand style. The story of the Atlantic crossing was great. The first encounter politics was fascinating. As the author extended the first encounter through the generations the story lost its compelling nature.Though the storytelling of the ""later generations"" did not grab me, the information was good. Being a West Coast guy, I never knew this story. But I couldn't figure out why the story was extended to the point it was or why it didn't go farther.The author displays a fabulous narrative style for parts of the first generation. If nothing else, the narrative from the beginning up to the first ""Thanksgiving"" was very satisfying."
3,Secular View of the Pilgrims,"Imagine the following books:-- A new ""Mozart Biography"" written by someone who is tone deaf, never played a musical instrument, and finds classical music dull and boring-- ""The History of Golf"" by a ""golf widow"" who wonders aloud why anyone would want to go around hitting a little white ball into a hole-- ""A Guide to Gourmet Cooking"" by Dave Thomas, Wendy's Founder-- a self-help relationship book written by someone deeply steeped in daytime TV soap operasSomething would be missing, right?That's what ""Mayflower"" was like for me. The author seems to have no intuitive feel or respect for the Christian sensibilities and passions that drove the Mayflower expedition. Instead he offers up a sentimental ""Dances with Wolves"" view of the Native Americans they encountered, which seems rooted in a nave and befuddled ""why can't we all just get along"" viewpoint, ala Rodney King.If you like subtle yet sophisticated Christian-bashing, this book's for you."
4,Great discussion of Native American-Pilgrim Relations,"This exceptionally well written popular history includes a great deal of coverage of the technology of 17th century sailing and a good deal more coverage of the cultural conflict between the English intruders and the Native Americans, flaring to the vicious bloodletting of King Phillip's War.I gave the book only four stars because I thought the absolutely necessary coverage of Puritain theology and 17th century politics was scanty in the extreme. We needed to know more about what motivated Puritains to leave Europe for the New World."
3,Just another Old World disease?,"It was interesting to learn how the Pilgrims filled the population vacuum created by previous diseases of lesser lifeform. I came away from the book thinking that the European settlers represented just another wave of disease to the indigenous species. On recent travels to New England, I couldn't help thinking that the cancer had seriously metastasized and it is difficult to envision an evolutionary path out of the mess. It is not difficult to imagine a future population vacuum once again created by some wave of disease leaving bleached bones scattered about as similarly witnessed by the Pilgrims when they arrived. The book could have used a better analysis of the psychology of the early settlers. Leiden sounded good. What possessed them to go somewhere where 50% of them were dead after the first year?"
2,A book that was written about the Mayflower,It's so much more than just about a boat named mayflower. it's a book about the beginnings of a nations. and what in turn that means over the hundreds of years since it originally happenns.
4,Mayflower,"Overall it's a good reading. I knew of course the basic story, but I learnt many new details - I have now much more sense about who these people actually were, their personal story, like this of Bradford who was the governer. I also have the insight from ""the other side"" - the natives view of the events, who were the persons there and what their feeling were. The book proceeds to the story of King Philip war on 1675-6 which is also a part of history about which I previously new only the basic facts and now I got some more details.Problem is that sometimes there were too many details about specific fights that got somewhat tiresome and on the other hand I would have likes to read more about the feeling of the ordinary people there, not only about the heros - like Benjamin Church - but also about the day to dat life in these small towns in such times. I feel that I got plenty of courage and war and less of a community."
2,MAYFLOWER: A SHALLOW VIEW OF PILGRIM LIFE,A large precent of the book deals with Indian wars. There is very little mention of the motivations and actual lifestyles of the Plymouth Colony residents. These people are fascinating. The book is not.
4,This book...,"reads like a novel, but it is a collection of recorded accounts by members of the Mayflower, their descendents, and observations from people from the period that lets you into the Pilgrims world. It is not for those who wish to keep tradition and obscure the facts: these were very hardy individuals whom wanted to establish a Christian society free from the encumberance of an existing church while doing anything it took to survive in the wilderness; even if it means stealing the Native's corn or preemptively attacking them when you thought they might attack. Needless to say such actions would ultimately bring these groups to conflict, but amazingly it took a full 56 years to do so! This book is for those who want to know who the Pilgrims were, and how they differed from the Puritans, or the various Native tribes, or from the Dutch or the French."
4,Excellent tome,Gives an excellent perspective on a much ignored period of American history. Should be required reading in our high schools.
2,I don't understand....,"What makes this film so great? I have read every single review here and everyone seems to like this film alot. I thought it was okay, but it wasn't great. There were a few funny scenes in the film, maybe I just don't get British humor like others do. I did think Brad Pitt and Dennis Farina were both very good in the movie. Farina was by far one of the funniest things about this film, I would say the dog that squeaks is the other. I was not a fan of Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrells. I fell asleep. I fell asleep in this one too. It picked up a little bit half way through, but it was by no means a true comedy. It was just your typical ""Heist"" kind of movie."
3,Tries too hard,"This DVD tries too hard to be a hard-nosed British gangster movie with quirky characters, but it falls short for exactly this reason - it tries too hard. And it is difficult to follow the convoluted plot. If you're looking for quality, tough, Brit-gangster movies, get Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels or Sexy Beast instead. Those are the real deal."
2,This is a re-release of the deleted first special edition!,"This new version of Snatch is a re-release of the original 2 disc edition that has been off the market for the past 2-3 years. This one has added a little poker set (bad cards and a dealer chip) as well as a booklet. The problem i have is that in the one i bought, the superbit version was included as the first disc - not the one that was supposed to be there with the commentary and branching features. Don't know if this was widespread or not.The cards are terrible. The Suits are diamonds (like in the film) but also boxing gloves, guns and the dog. WTF mate. Also the numbers are in a bad font - stretched thin and difficult to read. The booklet replaces the on disc filmography i believe and adds some production notes - its good looking and a nice edition.If you have the deleted edition there is no need foir this - if you have any of the others this one is better than any other version and its pretty inexpensive."
3,Great Movie - what's new with this DVD,"I have to agree with a previous review. I have a 2 disc DVD that I bought in 2001 or 2002. It is chock full of stuff and truth be told, I never watch the second disc. I saw it once and don't need another version of a movie I already have to see something I might or might not watch. Forget the re-releases - go through the catalog look on the web and release the ones we have on waiting lists."
5,DVD to own,"I dont buy DVDs often, in fact, I think they are a complete waste of money. I mean, who wants to see the same movie over and over again? Snatch changed my ways. I completely enjoyed this film from start to finish. Much better then ""Lock, Stock"". Characters were interesting and humorous, camera work was great, plot was twisting and engaging, all in all an enjoyable film worth buying on DVD."
4,Excellent flick.... but is the DVD defective?,"Snatch is really an excellent, exciting, VERY funny movie. Alot like Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, only better though. However, is anybody else having problems with the DVD? None of the deleted scenes will play on mine. If they are defective, I wonder how we can reach Columbia/Tristar to let them know? I went to their website, but there is no contact/email there. :("
5,Sha From Bethnal Green Heart of East London (Snatch) rules,"this film is like so proper spankingly crazy and thats what I like to see the british boys making for the cinema's around the world, ritchie might be influenced by americans but ladys and mates he hasn't lost his cockney attitude of making a twisted film i'd keep on going to watch his future releases on his new movie debut's.snatch is like proper crisp blnded characters with 2nd class culture in it and that makes this movies so great.keep up the good work ritchie Bethnal Green Side is rocking...."
4,coolest film of 2001,"awesome film about british gangsters. brad pitt is hilarious as the fast talking, tattooed pikey. coolest film of 2001."
2,Don't bother,"despite the all-star caliber cast, this script is contrived and badly structured, making it hard to pay attention to the movie. The cinematogaphy and idea behind the plot are good; however the acting is sub-standard for this group, and ultimatly, this is smiply boaring. Don't bother renting it, and certainly don't buy it."
5,This guy is a pure genious!!!!,"He did it again... Martin Iveson = atjazz! I strongly urge you to read my review on another atjazz CD, 'That something'... Can't believe that this guy continues to produce ambient jazz/house/electronica of this standard... ""Labfunk"" is another masterpiece - and I can only say if you're a true fan of floating, galaxy CLEVER ambient/house/jazz, there's no way you can hide from atjazz!This guy rules! Really! One of the few who never produce [...junk]. I've never heard such a natural remix genious like atjazz. Sooo jazzy & harmonic and even god damn funky on this one. Yet still ambient and the real galaxy thing. Buy it now. This guy is THE king. Costes, Claude Challe & co. are pure amateurs compared to his work... While at it, atjazz it ;o)"
4,Cooler than the other side of the pillow,"Harmonious, adj. 1. Sweet-sounding, tuneful. 2. Forming a pleasing or consistent whole; concordant. 3. Free from disagreement or dissent.The liner notes speak for itself. This album has an attitude to it. Breakbeat, House, Downtempo, and Jazz equate to Labfunk being a well pieced together free flowing form which echoes a throwback to the 70s with plenty of funk included. Those muted horns, driving keyboards, and garage-tinged bass lines are excellent. Do not expect any sounds to get your party hopping but the finesse and ease of delivery would be a perfect night cap for any fan of the above noted music genres. Herbie Hancock was one of the primary motivators behind this album and is directly credited in the liner notes. This album has 1974 written all over it. Gotta love it. Gotta have it. While I can't give it a 5-star rating, it is a super solid 4. For a slower version of Labfunk be sure to explore Muki's Quiet Riot album."
3,nice but not all that,"nice for girls who like to have fun with makeup, but before my daughter could even use the book it came apart and i had to glue it back together before she could even check it out for the first time."
5,Silence,A beautifully written book about how to be comfortable with silence and how it helps everything in your life make sense.
1,new suave daily clarifying shampoo does not clarify your hair,"I have used Suave daily clarifying shampoo for years and it was a great product, but since they changed it it does not clean off the oils and leaves my hair a yellowish tint not the white I have been used to. This new formula that suave is using does not clarify your hair it work like every other shampoo. it cleans your hair but does not clarify as it did in the past. I will probably stop using this product and do not recomand it for whiting your hair.If you notice most of the reviews that talk about how good this product is,are several years old and the disapproving ones are of this year, since they changed the formula."
1,harley mom,"We got this for our son at 11/2 he can't reach the pedals yet but man he gets it around. He loves all the lights & sounds. He sometimes just sits on it and pushes all the buttons.I love that the seat adjust to three different levels, I didn't realizes that when I purchased. We have not left it out side just because of the electric stuff. our son would kill if it did'nt work."
5,Triplet Mom,I really enjoyed this book. I felt like someone finally acknowledged the emotional roller coaster ride of being triplet parents.This is a must read for all triplet parents!
2,nothing exceptional,this product shrinks with washing. can buy the same quality at discount store. would not recommend
2,Beware the softcover edition because it is missing pages,"I was really enjoying this book until I hit page 37. That is because I then realized there was no page 38. Or 39 for that matter. In fact, it does not resume until page 46, so I would say be wary of purchasing the softcover version of this book. To be fair it does seem like a nice introduction to this subject. I just have a preference for new books containing all their pages."
3,Depressing book,"I read this one for a few reasons. I had seen the movie. it was a ""classic book"", and the price was right at the time. Honestly I was glad when I finished. It was such a downer of a book. The main character had a horrible life and that was pretty much the summary of the book. I guess its proof that just because a book was a ""classic"" does not mean it always good. Read it, but don't expect to come way refreshed."
3,Movie was better,The book was ok. The movie was much better. I kept trying to finish and it was hard to do.
2,FOR A CHANGE THE MOVIE WAS MUCH BETTER,"I WAS EXCITED TO READ THIS BOOK BUT, I FOUND MYSELF YAWNING. I LOVED THE MOVIE AND THOUGHT WOW THE BOOK MUST BE REALLY GOOD. USUALLY THE BOOK IS BETTER THAN THE MOVIE . SADLY, NOT IN THIS CASE. IF I HAD READ THE BOOK FIRST I CERTAINLY WOULD HAVE HAD NO INTEREST IN THE MOVIE"
2,NOT WHAT I EXPECTED,This did not have the music on it that I expected. I was definitely not one of my favorite Rock N Roll DVD's.
4,This IS a good video!,"I was looking for a BOC concert on videotape and this was the only one I could find. To my dismay, the review of this concert, by many, was terrible. I waited a while, but finally bought it just to see if it was as bad as some were saying. Personally, I thought the tape was great.! I wasn't disappointed at all! Yes, the production is not very good; yes, the sound isn't very good either; but remember this tape was made back in 1976! This concert is basic. There are only a few colored lights and the stage is pretty dark. But so what! If you think or expect this to be like music videos or concerts of the ""90's"" or the ""80's"", you will be disappointed. Technology has clearly come a long way! I would recommend this tape to anyone who is a fan of BOC!"
3,Who Is Dave McCoy?,"Who the Hell is Dave McCoy anyway? Just another stuck up music critic that doesn't like Heavy Metal music and shouldn't be writing a review on a BOC concert. That's right Dave, it's BOC not BLC, what a joke. If Blue Oyster Cult was past their prime (according to Dave)five years before this concert (1976)that would put them in their prime in 1971, hey Dave, the first Blue Oyster Cult record wasn't released until 1972, get a clue! What do you expect for a concert recorded in 1976 on what was probably a small budget? Of course it's not going to look or sound that great. And yes Dave, this DVD IS for die hard Blue Oyster Cult fans, unlike yourself."
3,Bit of a downer,"I'm a fan of ""alternative"" Christmas music, and can barely stand ear after year of the same in the stores and on the radio.This album meets that standard, but many of the songs are rather depressing.I like the artists, and have been a fan of the McGarrigles for a while (1970's)."
2,Thank God I'm not alone,"After reading Willow, I was desperate to read the rest of the series, I bought the whole series from the USA as it would be quicker. All was great until now, where I am in the middle of Into The Woods. I was so shocked to see internet and Shania Twain and other modern things, that I promptly got on the internet. I thought that surely there must be a mistake, and if I read further that all would be explained. As I can see, there is no mistake. All I can say is I am VERY disappointed, as the reason I read Virginia Andrews books is the familiarity.(Although I agree we need fresh stories). Anyway I will carry on reading, as I quite like Grace, she reminds me of someone......."
1,Make sure you Google this rip-off before getting hooked!,"This product... like most rip-off schemes gets you hooked, asking for higher and higher sums while offering you nothing.Google ""Jeff Paul"". You will see countless complaints from people who have lost thousands. Many people have reported that they don't give money back (their promised ""money-back guarantee is useless).Outside of their wonderful adds. I haven't heard of anyone who has made any money on this."
5,One of the best,"I have been a Gene Pitney fan for almost 50 years. Some so-called ""experts"" relegate his work with the minimally talented teen idols of the late 50's and early 60's, which kept him out of the R&R Hall of Fame for many years. The truth is evident to anyone who isn't tone deaf - Pitney's exceptional R&R voice ranks with The Big O, Timi Yuro, The Everly Brothers, Lonnie Mack (...yes, Lonnie Mack sang fantastic blues) and very few others of that era. This superb compilation finally has every major song and more from his peak career in the 1960's. It only lacks the rare cuts from his pre-hit period, such as the demo gem ""Make Believe Lover"", which alone is worth the price of the excellent Bear CD ""Hits and Misses"". I only regret missing my one chance to see him in person in Syracuse a few years before he died - rest in peace, Gene."
5,Love listening to the oldies...Neicy style!,"This CD is very easy to listen to, I missed listening to Deniece Williams and this album is a great way to reacquaint herself with her fans."
5,Winter working machines at work,"Wow! Machines are working extremely hard to make sure that the snow does not block the streets or pile too high. It is a lot of hard work, but somebody has to go through it. And if the truth be told, as long as a machine can be used, I would probably help out if I were part of the staff. Those machines in this program are extremly ingenious! Without them, those tasks would require many humans. Great work Mighty Machines."
5,Winter Blast is a Blast,"Both my boys 3 & 6 have been huge fans of the Mighty Machines series but this is one of their favorites. Satisfies the snowplow addict in your family. Note: They also love TRAIN YARD, LIGHTS & LADDERS, DIGGERS & DOZERS & TREMENDOUS TOOLS. Also check out the ""ALL ABOUT-BIG MACHINES"" series."
2,Not as good as season 1,"The story was kinda silly, plot watered down, chemistry was horrible. Really wish the writers stuck with the first season magic."
2,wrong region,I bought this thinking it was region free and when it came it was region 1. Very disappointed indeed. Not happy
2,"I would watch Jessica Alba reading a dictionary , dressed like a nun and on black and white film, but....","that is the only reason to watch season 2 of Dark Angle. I loved season 1. It was edgy and different. Oh yea, it starred the smoking hot 19-year old Jessica Alba! Seriously, who can forget the pool scene!I watched Alba in the movie ""Sleeping Dictionary"" even knowing that she was using a body double!Season 2 is disjointed and overly ambitious. Does she or doesn't she hook up with real life fiancé (at the time) Michael Weatherly? Oh, and there are more freaks (as defined by society) out there.I had to tell myself after the first week that is was all because of Jessica Alba."
5,Revisiting Dark Angel,I purchased the 2 Season Set years ago. I was revisiting the series. I finished watching season one. I got to the last disc of season 2 and my disc was somehow damaged. How it happened I do not know. But imagine spending hours reliving the drama and not seeing the conclusion!I was elated when I found it on Amazon for a price less than I originally paid. The DVD is in excellent condition. Now I can rest easy and put away it until the next time I hunger for this type of series. I love the relationship shared by Max and Logan..Friends Forever!
2,Not great,"I really enjoyed the first season and was looking forwarded to watching this season and I was dissapointed. I found the writers took the idea to far. While the first season took a strange idea which one could possible believe may one day possible happen and ran with it, the second season just went to far and completely made it to far fetched. I did love the Jensen Ackles charchter. That is what made me give it the second star."
2,This series deserved to be canceled....,"Please note, I gave the second season on Dark Angel 2 stars only because on Jessica Alba (I would have given it 1 star without her), heck she is THE ONLY reason to watch this otherwise totally unwatchable show.The first season began with some interesting possibilities, but soon sank into a badly written, and poorly acted version of ""Tank Girl"", complete with human/animal hybrids. Of course, Jessica Alba was totally watchable. However, the stories were so lame, the writing was at Jr. High School levels, even this amazingly beautiful actress could not make this show worth watching.Do yourself a favor and pass on this set of DVDs. However, if you feel the overwhelming need to waste your money on something, instead of buying this set, spend it on something like Silly Putty"". You'll find Silly Putty to be more interesting, and much more entertaining."
3,Dark Season,"Unlike the first season of this series, the second one didn't have me hanging on every word the characters said.The second season lost many of the appealing plots the first one had, and the relationship among the characters grew simpler and simpler.But even not being as good as the first season, the second season of Dark Angel is worth seeing. Too bad they didn't do a third one."
3,Lukewarm,The sex in this book was well done considering that there was not that much chemistry between the main characters. However I found the book to be rather bland. Sex without a good story and good chemistry to back it up becomes just lukewarm in my opinion. I never got the feeling that their relationship would last.
2,is not blue at all. misleading product,i was expecting these to be somewhat blue even though i know it's halogen. you get what you pay for and these are just like the stock halogen lights. do not buy if you dont want a halogen look. i was trying to match these bulbs to my hid's on my celica. doesn't match at all.
1,There are better software out there!,"I agree with the above users, there are better software out there. Please look around and be more futuristic. QuickBooks is for very small companies only. It slows down when the size of your database goes up. I tested some software and found some really good, with reasonable price: BusinessWorks, Small Business Manager (microsoft.com), Quick Business Manager (bisaim.com),Vision Point 2000 (ACCPAC), BusinessVision 32 (Softline).Good Luck in your search."
3,harper's folly,"though i have been a reader of harper's for only 20 of its 150 years--13 percent of its total publishing history--i welcomed this anthology with great anticipation. Then why was I disappointed when the heavy tome arrived? its size makes it too unwieldly to read, especially in bed where i normally read all my harper's magazines. it's like going to bed with a cement block. granted there are some wonderful essays (read: the history of the magazine parallels the cyclical highs and lows of publishing in this country), some stand out in greater relief, such as trotsky's warning about hitler. there's something to be said about reading journalism as history, and this collection won't disappoint. plus, there are some of my favorite essays of a recent vintage--david foster wallace on the state fair or richard rodriguez on san francisco's new gentilty. in any case, buy this book if you have strong biceps; otherwise, content yourself with the stellar monthly magazine."
3,"Practical, but Simple Advice","If you've NEVER played video poker, this is a great starting place for tips and very basic strategy. Some of the statements the author makes are along the lines of; ""I've heard that machines can be programmed to give better hands to lower bets."" These make for interesting anecdotes, but not much in terms of substance. However, the author provides good information for introductory strategy that will definitely save the novice player money. In a book of this nature, I think it is essential that there be information on which machines are statistically full-pay machines and which are not. For instance, if a jacks or better machine pays 9 to 1 for a full house and 6 to 1 for a flush, perfect play over the long run will yield close to full paybacks, while a machine that pays 8 and 5 to 1 respectively, is only a 94% payback machine. This information is critical if you want to play for very long, but isn't found in this book."
3,Basic info,This is an okay book. It tells you a few tips about how Mckinsey works and the tools they use to get answers. It is simple stuff but you can see why it works. If you were thinking about working at McKinsey this book would be of great help. They work new staff to the bones (80 hr work weeks are the rule) and staff are away from home all the time. The plus of this is you learn an enormous amount about business. It would be like being in the Marines. You can do it when you are young and then it is great when you get out.
1,Not worth the time it takes to read and it doesn't take long,Nothing special in this book -- I would be more than happy to send my copy to anyone that wants it.
1,Read ANYTHING else - even the phone book!,"Like many others, I bought the book because I thought I might learn something about McKinsey. What I found was a tired set of recycled ""ideas"" and stories that have little or no application to my business life.I checked Amazon.com's Purchaser Circle to see what McKinsey folks are buying and this book is Number One on their list -- for me, that is the 13th stroke of the village clock that casts doubt on the preceding 12!I read a hundred or more business books a year. I'm sorry I wasted my time on this one."
3,"It works, but the design is awful.","While this device certainly performs its functions, it has numerous design flaws. For dance mat mode, accessing it is a pain and some inputs have their positions reversed. For normal controllers, all of the buttons are rotated clockwise for some reason--logically, A = O and B = X, but the designers decided to make A = X and B = Square (?!). Also, the Dual Shock 2 has analog buttons, meaning it can tell how hard you're pressing them. This device doesn't seem to recognize any input at all unless you press the button somewhat harder than you normally would. This may be a problem with my controller, but that is unlikely, as it is brand new. Finally, the ""vibration feedback"" (rumble) support, while functional, is only barely so--the vibration is rather weak."
5,PS-2 to WII Controller Adapter,"This adapter is awesome! We had very nice pads for our PS2 DDR games, and were sad when it died. After getting the WII, we waited patiently for DDR to come out for it. When it finally did, we were quite disappointed by the smaller VERY thin pad which came with it.That said, the controller adapter works perfectly. We turned off the WII power, plugged the ""good"" pad into the adapter, plugged the adapter into the WII, and turned on the power. Voila! It worked perfectly, and has ever since.I HIGHLY recommend this particular adapter..."
5,"A ""Must have""","Sang H. Kim does a fabulous job describing the ""What, Where and How to's"" of 9 basic essentials to improve one's martial arts skills. This DVD is a must have for the serious martial artist! The wealth of information and practical exercise suggestions is worth far more than the price I paid for the video! There's also some added bonus features!."
4,"Great ""Real Life"" Mafia Story","The story of Joseph Pistone is an un-matched undercover story of the mafia. Pistone goes by the name ""Donnie Brasco"" and infiltrates one of the most notorious mafia families in the 70's. The book begins to drag on and reads like an FBI report rather than a novel. The movie also had it's ""Hollywood"" version that I like to believe is the real story. Or maybe. Pistone could not admit that he helped dispose of a body. The movie version was better, maybe because Pacino and Depp are the main actors. The book is still entertaining if you enjoyed the movie."
4,Donnie Brasco- or My Mafia Life in the Bush of Ghosts,"Donnie Brasco is a fine book because Joe Pistone conveys what it's like to be the pioneer of something extremely dangerous and unknown in isolation. What is amazing is comparing the modern day FBI survellence techniques, with their tremendous technical and personnel support, and the stripped down solo flight of Joe Pistone. It would be like being an astronaut on the moon during the 1960's with a lunar module that was powered with a computer like your PC and the Space shuttle today. The book is accurate about how Joe Pistone never lost his personality and character even though he had to act like a mobster. In truth, Joe Pistone loved his family and was especially kind to endangered teenagers."
4,Great account of the FBI's penetration of a Mob family,"Pistone's account of the time he spent infiltrating the Bonnano family was truly spellbinding. It was a good read, and differed substantially from the recent film. Although not quite as entertaining as books such as Wiseguy, it was nonetheless well worth reading."
5,Smal but great,"I love this little thing its been a year and the battery still works. It is small, but pretty loud I us it at work and love it. Very portable fits in the palm of your hand."
2,Not A Solid Release,"First off, Thrice is a great band. I love Identity Crises. Hands down one of the best records of last year. Anyway, The Illusion Of Safety is Thrice's Second Full length album to date. I am not very impressed with this release. Thrice got rid of alot of thier poppunk and replaced it with cheesy Metal riffs. There are no songs on this release that are up to par with past songs like Identity Crises,Ultra Blue,To What End,A Torch To End All Torches, and T@C. The last five songs on the disk are pretty good, but the songs don't measure up to Thrice's earlier work."
5,An AMAZING! Album and Amazing Band,"This is one of the bands that shocked me a lot! I'm actually not a punk rocker, i used to be but punk this days bore me, so im into heavier stuff right now. But this album is so Hardkore i gotta have it. Thanx to a friend of mine i discovered this band to my rock world. I got five reasons this is a 5 stars band. First, it haves an amazing production, second, the music is so explosive, their guitar riffs are so melodic as heavy, it reminds me of Black Metal solos and guitar riffs, which i love; third, the time change is amazing and the combination of hardcore and melodic emo punk really drives it; fourth all of their album songs are Awesome and none of their songs sucks and fifth, the band Rules!!! 5 reasons why i like'em so Much"
5,AMAZING,This is an amazing TV. The picture quality is outstanding - even on analog channels. The HD channels and DVDs can seem almost 3-dimensioanl.
2,cost to much for what you get,the product works just fine but it hard to believe that max size for the data card is 512mb for 120+ dollars and you can buy a 2g sd card for 7 to 20 dollars figured you might get more bang for your buck since the data card is twice the size of a sd card
5,"I tried this product a few years ago, ...","I tried this product a few years ago, and wasn't impressed. After receiving the product again, I must say -- they've made some big improvements! My hair is very soft and shiny after using Pert Plus, and I have also had my 8-year-old daughter use it as well. Her hair is shoulder length and tends to get tangled easily. After using Pert Plus, I noticed a significant difference in the reduced amount of tangles in her hair. Having shampoo and conditioner built into one shampoo is also a plus. Her hair is very shiny and soft after using it. I would definitely recommend Pert Plus to my family and friends."
4,I usually stay away from shampoos like Pert ...,"I usually stay away from shampoos like Pert Plus because my hair needs extra conditioning, but this worked great on my hair. My whole family loved it! My six-year-old daughter, who also needs conditioner, liked the idea that I didn't have to rinse her hair twice. I would recommend this to anyone. Oh, and it smells great too!"
3,"Overall, I thought this product was okay. It ...","Overall, I thought this product was okay. It doesn't work on longer hair. If you have short hair, it seems to work. With longer hair, it's impossible to comb through your hair. This is a time saver, to have the shampoo and conditioner all in one."
4,A great game for the beginning Role-player or Star Wars fan,"The games simplistic rules and only one rulebook to start (as opposed to Dungeons and Dragons 3) makes this an ideal game for anyone who wants to be a Star Wars charectar plus with the new wave of Episode 1 fans anyone is sure to find at least a few people to play with, if you like Star Wars or are new to Role-Playing, get this game"
5,"Unique, yet somehow familiar","I did not really think this album was anything special the first time I listened to it. I thought, ""well, it doesn't sound terrible""Luckily for me, I was too lazy to take the cd out of my car stereo, so it continued on loop every time I drove to work or school.Eventually, the songs became familiar, and I started to really enjoy them. Some of the guitar resembles that of Sonic Youth (I think so, maybe others wouldn't). The vocals take some getting used to, but eventually I grew to like them. They aren't beautiful so much as they are impassioned, perhaps that is why they make some people cringe.These songs are well thought out and, although it is apparent that this album is kind of dated (it is a very 90's sound, even if it's from the late nineties), I for one really enjoy and value it.This is my first Sleater-Kinney album. I bought it on a whim, and I look forward to hearing more of their music."
5,Carrie and Corin can!,"I saw Sleater Kinney live and they rocked my world! These women are sexy on stage, but, back to the album. This is one of those albums that at first is pretty good and a few months later you still can't get it out of your car stereo! I love the guitar riffs, these are the kind of women that make you wanna jump up and down whilst singing!"
4,Plumbing the murky depths...,"My first Sleater album was ALL HANDS ON THE BAD ONE, which I thoroughly enjoyed, so I jumped headlong into their back catalog with the enthusiasm of a newly-baptised rock'n'roll baby. Next stop: THE HOT ROCK. My first impression was that it needed a good dose of BAD ONE's humor and punch. But repeated listenings have revealed a complex & emotionally-charged album that irritates in the best way. As far removed from easy listening as you can get, tracks such as ""Start Together"" & ""Get Up"" don't so much rock as rattle the listener. A long time ago, rock'n'roll was about both fun AND challenge-- the challenge of facing your demons, destroying some of them, maybe partying with the others. You can't hum this stuff, but that's the point. Ever tried to hum the Stooges or Joy Division? Case closed."
2,eh,"poor corin. this whole album loses it after the first song. too bad she's turned into a cliche and her words don't mean anything. bleah. my heavens to betsy 7""s will stay on my record player, right where they belong."
2,Lacking structure and cohesion,"Put together a trio of girls who can shout, a couple of guitar players and a drum kit and you get raw and emotional rock'n'roll music. Well, not exactly. The result may be raw and emotional, but ""musical"" is a far stretch. The compositions on The Hot Rock lack structure and cohesion. It's acceptable that the girls can't hold a note and that their voices are flat, but that leaves all the songs with nonexistent melodies. Now add repetitious guitar lines and a laid back drummer from the Lawrence Welk orchestra . The listener is lost soon after the first 15-second introductions. Besides, Devo has been done before. Is there any point asking the Shaggs to do Devo? `Start Together' and `Don't Talk Like' are the only worthwhile efforts on The Hot Rock. Now you wait just a gosh darn minute Mr. Critic, if you only tried to ""understand"" it, then you'd learn to ""appreciate"" it. Sorry. I ""understand"" headaches, but I still haven't learned to ""appreciate"" them."
1,"um.....yeah,you DON'T need this....","Geez,this was a waste. First off,the guitars are terrible. They just mix together and create some kind off-melody,and second: The singing is absolutly annoying. It sounds like two cats pining for eachother,out in the middle of some outside new york apartment! It also sounds like total ... . I have listened to this CD countless times and i still fail to find it appealing. Buy a CD from a real riot grrl band,with real structure,like Bratmobile or the Rondelles. 15 dollars down the drain."
4,Luther's Table Talk,"very good but didn't have page numbersnot always sure of the topics, would be easierto follow if each page told topic."
1,Ripoff,All the apostrophes are printed as question marks. All the quotation marks are printed as question marks. What a big joke. Don't buy this book.
2,Falls Flat,"Disney usually makes good movies. Dick Van Dyke usually makes funny movies. The US Navy usually chooses the films it will work with carefully. None of these is true in the case of this film.VanDyke plays a naval aviator who bails out over the South Pacific after an engine fire. He goes into survival mode on a deserted island. He is aided by an abandoned WWII Japanese sub which serves as his ""Wal Mart"", a marooned chimpanzee who found the same island after a space shot and an Island girl fleeing her tyrannical, head hunting father. The film is full of Rube Goldberg type gadgets to make life easier and the sub is always handy to provide for every need. The fight against the head hunters is lame and the hero does not get or want the girl but treats her badly. She doesn't take it too well either. The chimp is the only decent character.Stay away from this one."
2,FUN!!!,This movie was requested by my husband to watch it. It was alot of fun but since the movie is too old there is alot of glitching.
4,Fairly good book,"I wish I could give it 3 and a half stars. the book was good, nothing great but pretty decient. It was a fairly easy read and had a decient story line, I do however think he should of did this story in one full novel, it seems to me that writers have sold out completly to commercialism and decide to make 3 books out of one, which ruins the artistic quality of the story... but over all it was a good read."
5,Fantastic,"Buy it. Read it. This was the first time I'd read one of Mr. Doyle's novels. I'll be reading the others. While A Star Called Henry isn't an easy read, it does require that you pay attention, it is more than worth your time. Someone tell me when the next book is due."
3,Do Your Research,"If you are not familiar with the particulars of the Irish Rebellion, you'll enjoy HENRY more if you grab an encyclopedia and read up a bit. The author assumes that the reader has a certain amount of knowledge, and this can be frustrating if you don't. I also recommend watching the movie MICHAEL COLLINS with Liam Neeson, which covers the same historical events as the book. Together they give a fairly complete picture of this period of Irish history.HENRY isn't my favorite Doyle title, but it has his usual scintillating writing. This is a tough story about a scrappy lad in a nasty time in Irish history. Worth reading."
5,Fun for Parents and Daughter!!,"Love this toy!! I don't know who has more fun with it, my daughter or my husband and I. Our six month old had just started crawling and sitting up by herself when we bought it, which was mostly because of the name. When we use the remote, she will race after it through the house. She also loves crawling after it when the remote is on the toy. We have gotten many giggles from this product!!"
2,Takes too many batteries and sucks them down!,"The other reviews are right, this is a FUN toy, when it's working. It uses 7 batteries, yes that's right 7! Not to mention, I found myself changing the batteries every 3-4 days. It drains batteries worse than any other toy I've seen. I finally gave it to charity."
1,Worse than nothing,"I had a completely different experience than the previous reviewer. All it did for me was turn the brake dust into a goo that not only would not hose off, but it was a pain to get it completely off with rags. I would rather have taken a dry rag to a dry wheel."
3,Wonderful review of lost family and cultural history,"Both my mother's parents came to the United States from Poland as children, sent alone on the boat with relatives' addresses in New York City pinned to their coats. Once here, they successfully assimilated, raised families, and bought homes. Family history and the effects of the holocaust erased the stories from the old country that could be handed down to future generations, including me. Ms. Hoffman's book recreates the socio-political history of Poland, and allows me to piece together various snippets of family history and attitudes and culture. I am sharing this with my family, as there were many ""ah-ha's"" of recognition for me in reading this work. While dry and more scholarly than I expected in some spots, this book was a gift to read. Thank you Ms. Hoffman."
4,"Confusing valve, heavy, clumsy sprayer, but otherwise fantastic","I've had this faucet for six years now, and I generally love it. The sprayer is too heavy and hard to use (I didn't want a plastic one, but now regret that choice!). Many guests are confused by how to turn it on. But other than that, it has great functionality. The sprayer does work well once you get the hang of it. And I think it looks really great. It's very big and tall, making it easy to wash big pots, and it swivels effortlessly when you want it out of the way."
2,Not much better than nothing,"The Iaudio mp3 player did not recognize my cameras, so this was suppoed to bridge the gap. It recognized one camera, but not the mp3 player. I then bought the 20Gb FotoChute. It transfers from the cameras quickly, to the PC extremely fast, with no problems."
1,USB Nowhere,"This item doesn't work at all. I tried it with 8 different combinations of devices and it worked just once. It is terribly slow just finding a device, and slower yet copying files. And then, it always has an error. Do not buy.I'm sending my back for a refund."
3,Heart broken,"None of the plants lived long. They got blossom end rott so very bad, that no matter what I did, they died off. Will be re-planting next year."
4,Not so lovable losers,"Is this book a satire on the whole Euro looney left? Seems like it. A long, but snappy and often funny backstory on how Ted becomes what he is in 2003/4 pokes fun at the 60's pink radicals and useless cold war intelligence games played by the Brits and East Germans. Le Carre just can't let go of Berlin and MI5/6/?? The ending gets a lttle confused and wraps up quickly with the USA religious right as the bad guys and le Carre siding with the Naomi Klein/Noam Chomsky - ites. And Ted and Sasha as absolute friends and not so lovable losers caught in the middle. All in all a good read!"
2,I feel betrayed,"I enjoyed le Carre's cold war books very much and had read everything he's written except Absolute Friends. I am about the age of Ted and Sasha and remember much of the times described in this book. I couldn't be of a more opposite viewpoint than the main characters. It made this book, although well written, very tough to enjoy. If David Cornwell truly has these leanings I'm very disappointed in him."
1,Waited for excitement that never came,Listened to the CD of this book. I had to force myself to finish it even though I was just driving down the endless highway. Just not my style.
4,wonderfully confusing,"Beautifully written, a joy to read through just like Constant Gardener, but I'm not the type who can follow spy plots and pre-war government philosophies, etc. I just hope they make a movie out of this so I can follow it better."
2,Save your money,"I missed the old flex shampoo, so I decided to be impulsive and spend almost $50 on this bottle, and the smell is completely not as good as the old stuff, and therefore I wasted alot of money and am very disappointed!!!Save your money!"
5,Thank you,Thank you very much for your quick service! Spriggan was a birthday present for a friend and she greatly enjoyed it.
4,Great show off scenes,"Review is opinionated, read my other anime review to get a feel for what I like.I thought this anime was awesome. Doens't hold entirely to its original manga, and the plot is a little farfetched, but this is anime. Not reality TV.Cloud, dust and snow animation are all very convincing. Watching the commentary will show you how much time and effort were put into the subtle things.this movie is about half action, half story. I found the action to be wonderful. the soundtrack was nothing impressive, but was entirely unfamiliar to me. The Sound FX of the movie are also top notch.There is a fair amount of glood, and the gore is not overwhelming, but there is enough of it. If you need a solid story or highly convinving plot, steer clear of this. if you want some good action, to be confused about some parts and to walk away remembering how good a few of those scenes were, I suggest it."
2,"Great action and visuals, but thats it!","Let me start out by saying the visuals are stunning and the action is good, but there's one major problem... the story ...! I bought this, on sale, at EB and then traded it in for credit as soon as I could. It has been the only anime DVD I ave ever given up. The action is also great but whating the movie all i was saying to myself was ""what were those writers thinking?"" So if all you want are visuals and action, look no further. but if you want anything else steer clear of this DVD!"
2,What a Headache,"We were told to get this system by a doctor. They worked fine for my husband, but they gave me the worst headache ever. Use caution."
1,"Beware, Not as advertised!","Claims to be a two CD set, but both CDs are Program 2Only gave it 1 star, bacause couldn't give it 0"
1,Brilliant Movie-- Rotten DVD,"I must add my voice to the chorus of complaints about this product. I paid a premium price for this DVD, and received a bad product. The transfer is lousy, in fullscreen, and yes, the subtitles suck. I have to wonder if the Yakuza have mounted a campaign against Itami's work, permitting only poor copies to make their way to the West. Hell, it's so hard to find this man's movies in the U.S. I have to wonder if this is a pirate copy, elaborately packaged and sent out to deliberately frustrate Itami fans."
3,"Bin Laden's MISTRESS has a book coming, too","This book was interesting, but a lot of it went over my head. Technical stuff.I'm looking forward to the book by Osama Bin Laden's mistress--Kola Boof. I hear that ""Diary of a Lost Girl"" uncovers a side of Osama that we've never before seen. I can't wait to read that."
3,OK product for the price,I was looking for a little better quality for this J.A. Henckel product. I'll have to keep searching for that exceptional shear.
3,"PRETTY GOOD SEQUEL, BUT WHY AIN'T IT ON DVD YET?","IN THIS 1991 FOLLOW-UP TO THE 1982 CULT CLASSIC, AN EVIL SORCERER NAMED ARKLON [WINGS HAUSER], WHO HAPPENS TO BE DAR'S LONG LOST BROTHER, TEAMS UP WITH A WITCH [SARAH DOUGLAS] TO TRAVEL TO MODERN-DAY L.A. WITH A PLAN TO GET A NEUTRON DETONATOR THAT WILL BLOW UP THE WORLD AND DAR [MARC SINGER] MUST STOP HIM BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE. A LITTLE SILLY AT TIMES, BUT THIS SEQUEL IS OK. IT SURE DOESN'T COMPARE TO THE ORIGINAL, BUT IT'S GOOD IF YOU'RE IN THE MOOD FOR ANOTHER LOOK AT THE BEASTMASTER. ONLY ONE QUESTION; WILL THIS ONE EVER BE ON DVD?!!!!"
4,"Better then ""Boombastic""","If you like Shaggy's unique blend of reggae with hip-hop beats (and sometimes hip-hop macho posturing as well) then as a complete work this is probably his best album. Songs like ""Oh Carolina"" and ""Nice and Lovely"" are genuine new reggae gems from the early to mid-Nineties, and I spent a great deal of my younger teenage years enjoying this album. If you like some of Shaggy's radio hits, this album isn't too much of a stretch from those songs and I would say that you would most likely enjoy it."
5,Hitch Mounted Bike Carrier was Great!!!,"I purchased this Bike Rack for our annual camping trip to the Beach, we do a lot of bike riding while there...The rack held all 4 bikes very securely, and the fold-down feature made it easy to unload the fully-packed truck bed!! I left it on the truck the whole time we were there; the rack portion folds down so it's out of the way in the interim. Very sturdy. Also comes with a strap to secure the bikes to the rack, if you wish. A VERY good purchase for the money."
4,Allen Bike Rack 2 inch receiver,"I received the Allen Bike rack and was surprised to see how strong the frame was. I did get 3 bikes on the Rack with no problem. I like the way in tilts out so I can open my truck tailgate, it gives me lots of room. Iam very happy with this rack. I leave it attached to my truck all the time."
5,Great Product at a Reasonable Price,"Extremely pleased with this bike rack. Works great, very heavy-duty construction and simple design at a price at least $100 less than comparable racks I was looking at from Yakima and Thule. I highly recommend it."
4,Great Value Rack,For $99 can't beat this rack. No problems at all. Spring pull pins are very convenient for raising and lowering rack. No squeaks or rattles. Very satisfied.
1,"Lacking two bolts, nonstandard hitch pin","Just received it today. Read all the reviews beforehand. Need a rack for about two times a year. Very careful opening the box...TWO bolts missing. Other people have shared this same problem. The nonstandard pin is really a pain. Don't see myself drilling it out to standard size and I'm definitely not purchasing the approx. $50 custom Allen pin (What a joke Mr. Allen the engineer??). Like many people, my life is too busy to send it back or wait on hold for an hour while they try to explain why they can't even send the bolts with the product. I'll go out and buy the bolts."
4,Good pack for occassional use,"This pack is well-designed but I am not sure of the construction quality. The straps holding the boots are a bit on the light side and I could see where there may be issues if this pack is used on a regular basis. However, I only go skiing a few times a year and this pack should serve very well for travel purposes and to keep what little ski gear I have consolidated during the off season. The zippers are large and the rest of the pack seems to be of good construction. I am very satisfied with this purchase."
4,Still Stands Up After 14 Years,"Barry G * Rugged Witness (Grapetree, 1995)""Ain't Nothin'"" hooked me right away with the smooth as silk ISLEY BROTHERS sample. ""Jesus Pleaser (remix)"" reminds you of the flow and style of the current Rap hits on Mainstream radio stations. ""I'm a Jesus pleaser, cause I love pleasin' Jesus ..."", sticks in your head and makes you real glad that this brother is back on the scene.Just like early P.I.D. reminds of RUN DMC, Barry G fits right in with your NOTORIOUS BIGS and CRAIG MACKS.Picks: I Got 'Em/ Step To Jehovah/ Ain't Nothin'LaZeric Fridell Freeman"
2,Blah!!!,"I agree with the author of the review on april 25 97. How can you blow all those big bucks on a Steinway, get all psyched up to take on the world and then think that a computer program or quick learn tapes can possibly teach you one of the most complex tasks that a middle aged human can achive. Nicely written though ( I kept hearing those darn NPR trumpets though out the book). Sell that crappy sailboat, get a teacher, roll up your sleeves, shutup and play your Piano!!!"
2,It is what it is,"worked for a couple months until a small crack appeared in the bottom. That put an end to its days of bootlegging. You get what you pay for, i guess."
5,great price and better christmas gift,"I WAS LOOKING FOR A GREAT SUPRISE GIFT FOR MY HUSBAND. HE ALWAYS HAS SAID THAT A HIP FLASK WOULD BE GREAT TO HAVE FOR FAMILY GATHERINGS. I FOUND THIS ONE AND IT IS VERY NICE, PERFECT SIZE AND QUITE CLASSY. THE PURCHASE STORE WAS A GREAT PLACE TO DO BUSINESS WITH."
2,Disappointed,"I very much enjoyed Sarum and London and looked forward to reading The Forest, but I was disappointed. The book is eight or nine loosely connected short stories. There's no overall page-turning plot, and Mother Nature seems to get more ink than the characters. I gave up midway through and moved on to better reading."
4,Great alternative to disposables,"I bought this to avoid the disposable flossers. I have a hard time using straight floss because of pain issues so flossers are best for me. I wanted to love this but I had a harder time managing it than floss alone. Let me be clear that this is not the product design or anything, but my hand issues. So I'm giving it 4 stars. It really is a great little product and I'd be using it if my painful hands allowed me to. Definitely give it a try!"
5,"Amazing product, everyone should have these!","This product makes flossing just another morning task. Before, it was a horrendous, nasty chore that I would avoid. This product has improved my dental health noticeable to my dentist."
1,No worth buying,It is way too big and wastes a lot of line. Plus too time consuming for very little return if any!
1,Doesn't hold floss,"No matter how many times I wrap floss around this holder and how tight I screw the knob at the bottom, the floss manages to slip. I can't even return this because it's more expensive to ship it back than to just keep it. Better to use your fingers."
5,global retro cutting edge,"Great Album.Think skate boarding surfers clubbing, funky house come electro. Track 5 ""He Not in"" for me sums up this album.just a great album... oh I wish there were more albums like this one!"
4,saddle up pardners!,Extensively researched and informatively written this is a mile-by-mile account of the famous Mojave Road and how to drive it in your suitably-equipped 4WD vehicle. Exellent directions and carefully drawn maps direct the visitor to the hidden treasures along the way. You don't have to drive the whole trail to get the best from this book as each section of the trail can be accessed from other better roads. So next time you are in the East Mojave National Preserve drive a little of this old pack trail which was a well-used native american trading route long before the days of mules and covered wagons; the drive time will be longer but the rewards will be greater.
1,LOL NICE TRY,I would never pay for this. DVD format with missing episodes? I could release that myself. What are they thinking? I'll stick with the other method of acquiring this one. What a great way to lose integrity and hurt sales.
5,Very Relaxing,"Since having many sleepness nights and many which needed sleeping pills, I have been very anxious about bedtime! For the past couple of years I have been on and off sleeping medications and have continued to have problems with fear at bedtime. Fear of not falling asleep would keep me worrying at night and in turn create what I feared... the inability to fall asleep! But, since I have purchased this CD I have used it whenever I get anxious. When I'm lying in bed worried about the night (because I'm in a new unknown place or the work day starts in just a few hours) I just put on my headphones and listen to the music. I can't remember the last time I didn't find myself awake after several hours, only remembering the first 5 minutes of the CD. After I first got the CD sometimes I didn't fall asleep to the music, but it was always calming and relaxing. If you're anxious and need some relaxation or sleep, this CD will be perfect for you as it was for me!"
1,Horrible,Parts of the CD are pleasing and actually helped me fall asleep at first but then there will be a 'burst' of music .... louder than normal ... that caused me to wake instantly. It's much like watching a TV show where the commercials are provided at a higher volume than the show itself. Parts of the music here build to a crescendo and that is anything but restful. I would not suggest this tape at all.
1,It's like a broken record.. not worth it..,"I am not sure how genuine these reviews are here but when I played this CD, It sounded like a some machine near my ears and could not stand it. Only way I could sleep was to turn it off.I read reviews on amazon and ordered it but I am so disappointed with this CD..I wish I could have returned it, Oh well..."
2,Delta Sleep,This product didn't help me. Have serious insomnia. But I do use it to relax when I rest in the afternoon.
4,This album makes it easier to fall asleep.,"It is not 100% guaranteed, but the recording is relaxing enough to make sleep a real possibility. Be warned: The Delta Sleep System is NOT designed for a room-sized music system; in fact it can be downright irritating coming through big speakers. It works best with a headset on personal players like ipods and mp3 players. (Yes, you can fall asleep wearing headphones - if you use the in-the-ear buds instead of the monster head sets.) My biggest gripe is that the recording has an abrupt break in the middle - like the company is still making vinyls with only 30 minutes per side, not cds. Wish they'd made it a single, seamless recording. If I'm not fully in the zone, that break is especially annoying."
5,Great Sleep Aid,"I have found when I have used this CD that I have had a very deep sleep and awake fully rested. Fortunately I'm not a chronic insomniac, but occasionally when I've needed a bit of help to unwind, I've found playing this music to really assist me falling asleep and staying asleep.The music on this CD is electronic sounding, so if that doesn't appeal to you, then it may not be relaxing. However, I've found the music is best played at a fairly low tone (ie. not too loud). Basically you only need to be able to just hear it. If you play it too loudly you may still have difficulty sleeping.After using this CD I always wake up refreshed and fully rested and usually with less 'deep' sleep than usual."
4,To Sleep or not to Sleep.,It has helped a great deal.I would still like to find something that helps you sleep straight through the night.I find when I wake up in the middle of the night that I do go right back to sleep with this cd.
2,dident work,"I tried this sleep system because i have problems falling asleep and due to the great reviews i figured it would work well. Ive used it about 20 times and i have not found it helpful in falling asleep but, i have found when and if i do fall sleep i get a better sleep with it playing in the background. I wake up more refreshed and more alert."
1,Delta Sleep System,This produce does not work for me. I have tried it more that three times and it didn't help me get to sleep. Maybe it works for some people but not for me.
5,Great service,"I am very pleased with the book, it is in great condition. It arrived very quickly and was packaged well and arrived undamaged so I couldn't have been happier."
2,A/C and car plugs don't work with TX,"With my (new) Palm TX and a Windows XP notebook, the charge/sync cable works, both syncing and charging (slow charge, I believe). Neither the A/C wall plug nor the car plug work at all. Since total cost with shipping was $10.50, I decided to keep it for just the cable."
2,Horrible,The foot pedals disappear and my sons feet drag and go under if parents don't notice right away which is painful. The handle for parents doesn't stay in place which is a pain. And it is almost impossible for parents to turn when they are dealing with kids who still can't steer or pedal yet. My husband and I took our son outside with it once and never again. It isn't safe since it is such a struggle for parents to turn we have to practically drag it from left to right and since it doesn't have a seat belt my son almost fell off the side. He only uses it to rock on at home and will not be using it outside until he can pedal and steer on his own.
2,Very disappointed,"I purchased this for my 20 month old son, and he is not interested at all! In the Rock mode, the bottom does not curve very much so it really doesn't do much rocking. After about a month of him not playing with it, we moved up to the Ride mode. He played with it for about a day, but as soon as he saw me pushing him from behind with the parent's handle, he decided he wanted to do that. So now he hardly ever plays with it, and when he does, he pushes it around like a stroller. I guess soon I will just take the handle off, and see if he will ride it. However it seems to me that the handle is hard to turn side to side, so we might just have to go get a regular tricycle. We've only had it for a couple of months, so I hope as he gets older maybe he'll like it more. Overall, very disappointed and would never recommend this to anyone."
4,Good Resource for any Student of Theology,"The Moody Handbook of Theology is a great resource to have in your library. It is split up into 5 sections: Biblical Theology, Systematic Theology, Historical Theology, Dogmatic Theology, and Contemporary Theology. It give a great definition and overview of each one and brings big truths into an easy to read format. No doubt it will be a great book to have and reference back to for the rest of my life. The only one thing that I would caution you about is the authors Dispensational Theology comes through in a slant a lot, which is to be expected. It is still a great book to have."
1,My order did not come complete as shown.,"There wasn't a ruffled cover, or pad cover! I had this sent as a gift!"
5,Great boot,"Perfect fit, very comfortable. Just what I hoped for.My 22 year old son liked them so much he ordered a pair for himself."
5,Excellent urban/casual shoe,"Materials are first class, has an attractive design and ankle support is pretty good. I chose the ""oily brown"" model and it looks very well, almost like the picture. For being a boot, it is truly comfortable and feels almost like a shoe. If you're planning it for heavy duty activities, then you should reconsider this option(i find the outer get scratched somewhat easily). Overall a good product, i would highly recommend it for casual/urban wear purposes."
1,Not up to date,"I just bought this book and after looking it over a bit I see it doesn't include PROC MIXED and barely mentions PROC GLM. They do repeated measures analysis with PROC ANOVA, which is a sad old choice. They use PROC ANOVA for analysis of variance, when PROC GLM became the replacement for that many years ago. It seems though to be useful to have on the shelf since I am pretty new to SAS programming and don't like most of the resources available. At least they put together a presentation of what sort of data you are analyzing with SAS program language which will be helpful though not entirely current. It's a resource. It would be nice if someone REALLY updated this text in light of the new SAS procedures."
4,Excellent Introduction,"I just completed a SAS course that used this book. I never used SAS before and found the book to be very useful and informative. The authors show you how to use the built in SAS procedures and provide basic guidance on how to interpret the results. It has a numerous examples which really helped me learn the basics about running t-tests, ANOVA, and regression. Notes: (a) The book does not cover every option available with the SAS procedures - this is actually good in an introductory book because it keeps the reader from getting confused. Don't buy the book expecting a technical programming manual. (b) The book does not cover macro programming (c) the book does not cover the more professional looking graphics procedures e.g. gplot"
2,Poor book,"I hoped more. It is a very basic book, with elemental examples and no clear directions on the best use of SAS."
1,Why?,Why would you want a fictional account of the battle of Beecher Island when the true story is absolutely riveting?
4,"An extremely pleasant, straightforward love stor: JOY!","Victoria (Torey) Storm, a fabulously wealthy, attractive, sincere, and kind young woman from the U.S. East Coast (is this possible, really?) is attracted to and helps her fourth cousin, Mitchell Storm, Chief of the Scottish Clan Storm, find a buried treasure that makes it possible for Mitchell to live on his island, take care of his 800 island clansmen, and offer Torey a life of beauty and charm. The dialogue is simple, witty, and honest. The plot blends modern and historical. The setting flits from East Coast mega-wealth to a quaint Scottish island. Although the ""struggle"" is not difficult and you never doubt the outcome, the dreamlike, wispy heroine and always correct, strong hero keep you reading just to enjoy the calm of these happy, confident people. You want this couple, and their friends, to be your friends."
5,Life Saver,"This book is a life saver. My husband has suffered from stomach ailments for years. I had suspected it was his gallbladder, but he never had it checked. He used Ms. Salaman's Royal Gallbladder Flushed, and it worked! He passed nearly 300 gallstones, and has felt wonderful since!"
4,Real Animation,"The Shipping was great, all short theatrical in excellent high def. If you love history there is a special bonus about the creation of the animation used in Fleischer's Studio. As Superman Fan most have in the collection."
1,What are they doing?,"Warner had nothing to do with these cartoons creation, it was Fleischer Studios and Paramount. Max and Dave Fleischer would role over in their grave if they knew their competition and archenemies, Warner Bros., were putting out the latest Public Domain version of their classics. Doesn't Warner have enough products; do they have to take from the Public Domain? The intent of Public Domain was to give independent artists a chance at lost art, not to fatten major distributors pockets. Shame on you!"
4,An interesting mix of sounds and sensations!,Ayurveda takes one on a contemplative journey into the inner soul. It is both meditative and awakening. I too found the enclosed information on Ayurveda the most informative that I have read.
2,Sometimes a bargain isn't one,"My husband is very picky about shave gels, primarily because he is most concerned about razor glide and his sensitive skin. My mistake on this product was not purchasing just one can of this for him to try instead of getting him a six-pack, even though the price was under $3 a can with super saver shipping. He is not happy with this product. He's been using this product since April and does not think that it lathers anywhere near as well as other products, namely, Gillette Fusion, which he prefers. Also, insofar as use on his sensitive skin, the gel is only so-so. The fragrance is okay with him. However, what he particularly doesn't like is that the gel does not promote smooth razor glide. Now we have about four cans left, which he will grudgingly use, unless I can find him a deal on Fusion. He's encouraging me to find one...soon."
2,O.K. if you don't care what time it is,"This clock gains about 5 minutes every 4 days or so. I have an old digital plug-in clock that keeps perfect time, but the alarm doesn't work. I bought this one for the alarm, but usually have to reset the time to match the old plug-in about twice a week. Also, if it gets dropped or knocked off the table, you have to reset the time. I've had 2 or 3 other clocks of this type that keep perfect time, maybe gain a minute or two every 6 months. I would not buy another Timex."
2,Elgin Travel Alarm,"Unlike some of the other reviewers, my clock seems to keep perfect time. I've had it for several months now and it does not seem to drift.However, if you actually want to be able to see what time it is you really don't want this clock. In order to see the LCD's, you need to be looking down on the clock from almost directly above it; there is a very narrow viewing angle. You would think that angle would be more nearly face-on, but that is not the case. The backlight does not help. If you're looking for a good travel alarm, I'd say ""keep looking""."
5,Please read slowly,"Probably the most misread work since the Bible.These are great little plays, but for some reason anything that gets so thoroughly co-opted into popular culture (as these oft performed plays are) loses all literary value.I highly recommend that anyone who hasn't seen the Kirk Cameron/ Growing Pains production of Our Town already to read these.This collection is a wonderful exposition on the human condition. I was giddy for a week after first reading it."
3,skin of our teeth,Strange but odd play at the end of Skin fo Our Teeth. a quick rerad and worth a look
3,strap broke,This was fun and looks pretty realistic when worn with a real boot but...the strap that holds the cover in place was broken almost immediately once put on. So just be sure to take it easy while walking around.
2,Droopy boots,"I'm a fairly big man with thick calves and despite trying to get the laces as tight as possible I couldn't keeps these up on my legs. They looked good, but I finally had to do what many others did and pin them to my pants."
2,Just terrible,"Bought these for a LARP. They worked well for about 1 hour. All of the elastic straps under the shoe broke and they kept falling. Ya get what you pay for, I guess."
3,Not the worst I've used,"Other Suave lines have worked better for me. This line isn't terrible, but it's just your average shampoo. At least that's how it was for me. It's worth trying since it's much cheaper than other brands. I did notice it slightly dried my already-dry hair out. I didn't find it very moisturizing, hence the 3 star rating."
3,"Reformulated, not as good","I have liked Suave's imitation Nexxus products for years but this has now been reformulated and is not as good. It's definitely not like Nexxus humectress shampoo. It's ok as a shampoo, doesn't lather as well or smell as nice as the old formula. So it's ok but if you want a Nexxus imitation, this is no longer it."
5,Great shampoo,I wish this was still on the market at stores but at least I can find it online. Kind of expensive but worth it!
1,What happened to the good old times?,"i was so anxious to get this CD that i didn't even listen to any sound bits to sample any songs off of this album. i went by what i heard on the previous album ""Designing a Nevrous Breakdown"", which was totally awesome. i really enjoyed that album so i figured that this one would be similar and was real dissapointed.there are about two songs that i would listen to and that's about it. it sounds like CARNIVAL POP MUSIC for goodness sake. i do not recommend this album and if you like emo music check outAppleseed Cast's second album, Mare Vitalis. it's awesome. sorry for being so harsh with this review, but i doubt anyone will listen or pay attention to me. hey, pay attention to me. hey!"
1,HORRIBLE!,"I'm writing this review not to jump on the reviewing bandwagon, but as a musical person and a songwriter.God, what an atrocity. I don't know what they were thinking when they made this but whatever it was i'm glad they didn't go on to make anymore of it. Mediocre, bland and instantly forgettable are the 3 things that come to mind when i think of this album. After purchasing their debut album, Designing a Nervous Breakdown, i was instantly hooked on the trading of male and female vocals and the kooky keyboard hooks. Simply genius that album is, and i'll love it for years to come.As for this one, do yourself a favor and everyone else within a 100 mile radius. Don't listen to it."
3,"Lots of great pictures, don't read the captions.","Written from a very biased ""look down the nose"" british point of view. Look at the pictures but don't read the text if you are American! Buy it for the pictures. A few pictures of the stone age british way of building a car, might be worth seeing for you ancient history buffs."
5,Best Boots,"These boots are unbelievable. I have never had boots that have been so warm, fashionable and comfortable. I wish I had had these boots when I was working outdoors all winter for Wyoming Game and Fish. They feel like bedroom slippers and although they are very warm I have worn them all day and been inside for most of that time without my feet feeling too warm. I would definately recommend ordering a larger size than your normal shoe size. I ordered a half size bigger for thicker socks but the boots fit well even with regular socks."
3,Return of the Jedi,"This soundtrack is not the original. Instead of being performed by the London Synphony Orchestra, it is performed by the National Philharmonic Orchestra. It is still great music though."
5,most intreging,"Yes I am only 14 years old but listen to what I have to say.I am in 8th grade,and have always found the roman empire fasinating.So one day I asked my teacher how the roman empire started.Of corse I know the mith,Romulus and Remus were rased by wolfs and sarted rome on the 7th hill.But I wanted to know the truth.So my teacher gave me the book The Rise of Rome.It anserd all of my questions and I gained new knowledge and a better under standing of the roman empire.I was reading a review hear at amason and it said the book was awful because it had inadequet translations,like useing new age frases insted of old world words.Well DUHHHHHH!!!!! This is the new world.That is not a good enogh reason of why not to read the book.It dosnt matter how the book is transilated,as long as the meaning and story is the same.So for all of you who are intrested in the roman empire I highly recomend this book."
3,The Khufra Run,"An easy read. Breezed through it in no time but lacked the usual in depth personal look that I am use to. Great action and interesting plot. Some of the dialoge seemed forced and out of place. This is the second book I have read by Higgins and am just as pleased with the story line in this book as with the one in the other. Overall I'd recomend this book to someone looking for a good, fast moving, light read."
2,Not What you would think,"Despite what songs are on this CD, most of which are not, in my opinion, sung by the original artists. ""Man, i feel like a Woman"" sounds more like it's being sung by Cher than Shania Twain. This CD is put out by a company who also makes Karaoke CD's, so there's a clue right there. Granted, it might be the original artists, but i doubt it, unless when they all showed up to sing and they all had colds. Just my opionion, but hey, if you want to blow money on it, well...The song by Garth Brooks ""When you come back to me again"" really sounds like Garth Brooks, and Toby Keith sounds like Toby Keith, but that's about it. To sum it up in a few words, very disappointed."
1,OLD SOFTWARE,"DOES NOT WORK ON WINDOWS XP OR NEWER MAC, SINCE I WON'T BE BUYING AN OLDER COMPUTER I'VE BEEN UNABLE TO USE IT."
3,Buzzword better for adults than kids/teens.,I wasn't as happy as I thought I'd be with this game. The tweens in our family lost interest quickly because they don't know a lot of the sayings and facts from the past. I would choose this game for adults rather than the younger set.
4,Outstanding game for all gatherings,"This is one of the few games we have been able to enjoy 'as-is' without making special rules or considerations for certain family members. It is easy in concept, but the time limits really add the challenge.Since many of the answers do require a working knowledge of Ameriicana, fads, and pop culture...I'd say the younger folks won't have as much fun. The age cut-off should be around 12.Excellent game....can't wait to bring it to the next reunion."
3,game for newly weds,my kids have been married for a year and needed something new and cheap to do with their married friends games like this are perfect.
4,If you like the movie then you will love the soundtrack,When one listens to the movie they will find amny songs that will relive the days of partying with the people in college.
4,Not Fm Live ...But Still Pretty Good,"No , It's not FM Live , but this is still a pretty good Cd .It opens with a great version of Sonny Boy Williamson's Don't Start Me Talkin then goes into Fool For The Bright Lights from the really obscure Drastic Steps album . Track 3 is Chasin' Change , a funky sort of thing from Gold Plated . Track 4 is a really good bluesy Lester Hunt song called Take Me Back To Georgia . About half the songs on the album are from the 80's and they're surprisingly good including a nice bluesy thing called Last Chance Saloon from the also very obscure Lucky For Some album . The album includes 4 songs from FM Live , all 4 are not bad but don't remotely compare to the FM Live versions . You also get a nice version of Towards The Sun from Tightly Knit and funky/rocking version of Willie Dixon's Evil .If you're a CBB fan , you'll really like this album ....even with the absence of Pete Haycock ."
5,Invaluable with the Saltzburg text!,"You MUST buy this if your class is using the textbook this guide is keyed to. It has very helpful quick outlines at the beginning of each chapter and then makes sense of every major case, throughout perfectly following the text. It was definitely my secret weapon for being better prepared for being called on in class and preparing for the final exam.Notes: The accompanying disk just contains the outlines already included the book in .txt format, and even though my disk was missing, I easily found the text outlines on the web. Also, this only covers the first half of the text. There is a second hornbook for the second half."
1,What Was He Thinking,This is one book I would never re-read and I usually do just in case I overlooked something the first time. I'm pretty sure this book would never get better even if I read it over and over. This book was awful and the grammar was just a bad.
2,Don't buy just for the pedigree,"I bought this book for the Harvard pedigree when other books offer more practical detail for the target audience. The text concentrates too much on taxation, a subject unto itself, and calculation of the time value of money. In particular the TVM issue focuses on formula versus concept which is not a service to the audience. Overall, I expected more from a Harvard Business Essentials book."
4,An exerpt from a scholastic annotated bibliography.,"An anthology or Scottish poetry in Scots Inglis as well as English, beginning with John Barbour and ending with Ronald Campbell Macfie. This anthology is organized chronologically and contains notes, a glossary, an index of authors, and an index of first lines and some titles."
4,"Good lock, terrible screws!","I installed this very easily, and it works very well. The price is affordable, but my biggest complaint is that the screws were TERRIBLE! I nearly stripped about half the screws until I decided to go to the hardware store and pick up some better quality screws. Be careful installing this with the cheap screws, you may end up with stripped screws in your door."
3,"OK, but a little too brief.",Could have been more to it. A very short read and it just sort of stops rather then ends. Art work is great.
5,I loved this book!,"I loved this book! I tend to be a bit on the skeptical side, and was therefore a bit hesitant to read it, but was strongly encouraged to do so by a friend. I'm so glad I did. I found the stories to be both believable and inspiring. I really liked the case study approach, along with the down-to-earth explanations and discussions. Dr. Miller is a wonderful writer. I would highly recommend this book."
3,Good Quality,I was always curious what Quince tasted like after hearing such rave reviews of it. I tried it the next morning on my toast. Meh...
2,The Grand Illusionist,"Nice pictures. Amusing anecdotes. Stories that tug your mouth upwards. Long on voodoo and short on substance, just like his presidency. If you're a fan, go ahead and part with the $20, just don't expect anything exhaustive or deep... then again, who would?"
5,Great Study of the Life of Franz Sigel,"A very enjoyable look at one of the greatest German Americans involved with the Civil War. Tracks his early days to his time as a commander in the Union Army. Engle provides the reader with a new insight into Sigel's life, with a fresh style that never disappoints. A book that is long over due and finally pays tribute to a forgotten figure of the Civil War. A great addition to a Civil War collection, especially if you are interested in Civil War biographies."
5,Fantastic Grammar book!,"I just bought this book for my Advanced grammar class and I absolutely love it.I really like the way it is written. It is very easy to understand. I studied French since I was little but at the same time I have been studying English. As a result I have forgotten French a lot, especially grammar. This book has helped me to review what I have learned in the past. It has helped me to refresh my memory. This is the second week I am using this book and I am entirely satisfied with its content and the method that is used in helping students learn and master their grammar.In addition, I really like the way the book starts with a simple grammatical rules such as nouns and pronouns. Often times, students have difficulties mastering those kinds of simple rules even french native speakers.I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who is studying French. This book will help you sharpen your knowledge."
5,ABC's,Very educational toy for my grandsons. They love putting the different letters in to hear their sounds. My grandsons especially love the ABC song that they can hear at a touch of a button.
1,Only a couple of the letter works,"I got this for my DD and we tried putting the letters in, most of them said the wrong letter, or makes a beeb sound. I have to go back to the store again to have it exchanged."
4,"Educational, but Obnoxious to Adults","Like other leapfrog products, this toy is educational, but the recorded sound is tough for adults to bear. Even worse, it's meant to be placed on a fridge. How anyone can stand it in the kitchen with this thing in full use is beyond me. Our 21-month old son seems to have picked up some recognition of some letters from using it, though. Whether it will last until he gets to kindergarten is another question."
4,Great Toddler Toy,I bought this for my son for his 3rd birthday. He loves the music and practicing his ABCs. It's also compact enough to take along on car trips. Would definitely recommend this and plan to buy this item as a gift for a friend's toddler.
5,Keeps kids busy while your cooking,"We bought this for my daughter's 3rd birthday. She likes singing the alphabet song and pronouncing the letters. I like the idea that this toy always has a place to go that is out of the way, on the fridge! No loose pieces to get lost in the toy box. I would recommend this toy."
4,Very nice!,"My son really likes this toy. He dances to the music, so cute. I didn't know it until it arrived but it was a year older for his age range, suprisingly he eventually figured out how to use it. I like it because it does sound out the letters, and I think that is important to learn early. Hope this helps."
5,Fridge Phonics is amazing!,"I bought this for my sons (3 and a half, and 17 months) my 17 month old absolutely loves it, he actually says 11 letters from the alphabet already! A great learning toy!"
3,Sound effects tinny,"We had bought the Fridge Phonics Wash and Go first, which my son loved and which had good sound effects. The Alphabet Set is not as much fun listening to as the sound is bad. The kid's voice sounds tinny and can be hard to understand at times - which is really inconvenient when your toddler is supposed to be learning phonetics with this toy!"
1,price disparity,I like this product. However the same product can be purchased at a national retailer for $19.95. I cannot believe their is such a disparity in the price!
1,Toy doesn't work - and Leapfrog customer service is disappointing,"Similar to the other reviews that have given this product a '1 star', mine does not work. The alphabet button works fine (so at least my child can learn the alphabet) but none of the letters work - a litle musical tone is all that plays, and that's hardly educational. I cleaned the battery contacts and replaced the batteries as directed in the users' guide to no avail. Unfortunately it stopped working at 5 months after light use (and warranty ends at 3 months) so there's nothing I can do since Leapfrog doesn't even offer any sort of repair service. It was a good toy before it mysteriously stopped working."
2,Learn to Spell!,"I got this for my daughter for Christmas because it got so many great reviews. Unfortunately, it didn't work well. It didn't recognize some letters at all and others it mistook for different letters. For example, it kept saying that ""M"" was ""Z"" or ""A,"" which is the last thing a little one learning the alphabet needs!The concept is great but ours was defective from the get-go."
5,Great educational toy for a tot!,"My boys ,4 years old and 2 years old, love this toy. The 4 year old loves grouping letters together to make words and the 2 yr old loves singing along with the alphabet song. Very helpful to keep them busy while making dinner! It is also very durable as this has been thrown around alot and still holding up strong =)"
5,Favorite toy on play day,"We have 5 mom's in a group and get together at least a couple of times a week for our kids to play. All 5 of us moms have bought Fridge Phonics because ALL the one and two year olds want to play with it. We have lots of toys, but this is the over all favorite. Tots just gravitate to it! Highly recommended."
4,"son loves it, however...","This is a great product. My 2 year old loves it. However, I would caution you to not use on high gloss refrigerators. We just purcased a brand new refrigerator and this toy and magnets scratched the surface in less than 5 minutes. It is now used on a magnetic board in the playroom!"
3,gets annoying fast,"Bought this for my 3-year-old last year and she quickly abandoned it for Barbie. My 2-year-old, however, loves it. Perhaps just a wee bit too much. It plays the same annoying song with the only change being what letter is in it. This gets old fast. If you can stand it, the kids will probably like it. Also, I find these letters all over the house."
4,Educational fun!,This toy is great while I am trying to do something in the kitchen like prepare meals. It keeps him busy while waiting. He is also learning his letters and the sounds quickly.Even sing them while playing. Great toy!
1,Toy does not work!,"I too was disappointed with this toy. My daughter (2 years old)loves the Leap Frog Letter Factory DVD, so I thought this was the perfect Christmas gift. I had the same problem as many other reviews. I would say 20 out of the 26 letters said the wrong letter name and some didn't say a letter name at all (they just beeped). Thinking I just got a bad toy, I exchanged it for another. I tried it as soon as I got back in my car (I couldn't bare to see a disappointed look on my daughter's face again). Again the toy did the same thing. So I didn't bother with it again and just returned it. This toy would be so cute if it worked the way it was suppose to. The catchy songs really had my daughter's interested in her letters. Too bad!"
5,Love,My 18m old loves it easy to use and the sound is very clear love this every little kid should have one
5,Thumbs Up,"Good stuff. Magnets on fridge, kid picks the letter they want and insert it. Fun + educational = practical. I would recommend it."
4,fun to learn the letters and sounds,"Fridge phonics helped my son learn alphabet and sounds with ease and fun. Whenever other small children visited our house, they fell in love with the same product also."
4,Great Educational Toy,"My three-year-old girl and one-year-old boy really enjoy this toy. It's a wonderful update of the classic ""magnetic fridge letters"" idea. All of the letters, as well as the larger device itself, attach strongly to a standard fridge magnetically. The device is of solid build quality, and the letters are fun and attractive.As to the operation, it's fairly straightforward. You press letters into the device, and it sings a little song with the letter's name and sound. A separate button plays the whole ABC song.The only downsides are that the product is rather simplistic and one-dimensional with only two tricks, so to speak. However, this also helps it teach just the basics, so that can be a good thing. Also, I think $20 is a little steep for what it does. Probably $15 is more appropriate for the value received."
4,A hit,"All the LeapFrog toys are a hit in my house. They are very well built and last. My son has dropped and banged this up many, many times, and it still works great. I read other reviews were people had some issued with theirs and I think they might of just got a dud.There are 2 different volume settings, I have found that the loudest is too loud for our house, When you press the music note it plays the ABC song. If you push the space where the lettter is suppose to go with out a letter, it makes a terriably annoying sound (and of course my son does this all the time).I didn't give it five stars because of the where you put the letters. The reason is the terriable sound,a nd because you have to get the letters in there just right. For a toddler sometimes putting the letter in the spot can be a trick."
4,Attention getter,This item is great for keeping the attention of toddlers. I highly recommend this item. Enough said. No more words required.
4,Might Let You Get Dinner Prepared,"This is a fun, educational little toy. As long as you don't have a stainless steel refrigerator it might even aid you in getting a meal prepared without interruption. Helps with letter identification & pronounciation."
5,Fantastic,"Our 17-month old loves this. Sings along, loves to switch the letters in and out. It's wonderful."
1,Did not work at all,"I don't know if our local retailer got a bad batch of these or what, but we purchased 2 of these sets (and returned two) because the base was mixing up the letters. (D = F etc., etc.)My preschooler was so disappointed.This is the third Leapfrog product we have had major problems with. Does anyone else have problems with Leapfrog?"
1,THIS WILL SCRATCH YOUR STAINLESS STEEL FRIDGE!!!,We bought this for our two year old and after a couple days of playing I looked at one of our fridge doors and there are scratches ALL over it. If it's dark in the room you can't see the scratches but as soon as the light shines in the kitchen they stand out like a soar thumb. It's a fun toy but only for fridges that aren't stainless!! I'm so frustrated!!
4,educational for my grandson,"I am happy with my purchase. I bought it for my grandson who is a busy little guy....18 months old. Wanted to have something for him to play with, nearby me or my daughter, in the kitchen so we could keep our eye on him better while cooking/cleaning. Education while playing.... what's better than that? He quickly learned to put the letter in the cutout, and the button to push to play the ABC song. Wish there were a couple more songs though. He does get excited and pushes all the letters off the refrigerator, then picks them up one by one and puts them back on. They seem durable enough so far. The doghouse magnet seems a good strength. He hasn't tried to push that off yet. :)"
2,You have to know the trick.,"My son received this as a gift. We opened it and it didn't work. It said the wrong letters. After trying the alcohol trick (didn't work!)I exchanged it and the second one had the same problem. I read the reviews on here and one of them said to use tweezers to pull out the tabs. I looked and sure enough, one of them was stuck. After alot of poking and tweezing, I finally got it unstuck. It's been working fine this evening. Hopefully it will continue."
5,Fun Alphabet Set,"My Grandsons love to play with this toy. It was on my daughter's wishlist for the boys, she only wants them to play with educational toys that help with home schooling."
4,My son loves it!,"My son loves this toy, but be prepared to have a way to store the letters! I find myself counting to 26 over and over as we look all over the house for all the letters.My son is receiving services for speech and he is imitating the sounds. I like the fact that the recorded voice is so easy to understand. It's a little off on some letters, but mostly clear.I would recommend this toy--it's fun and educational, but I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars because you need to be prepared to look for letters!"
5,Amazing,This is a great toy. My son began to pronounce letters very soon after he started playing with it. Its great to keep him occupied in the kitchen while Im doing dishes or cooking too. Definitely recommend it.
3,this product should be removed,"I'm sure this product is fine. That's why I'm giving it 3 stars. Don't order this item though.If you try to order it, the product you get is definitely not the item pictured. I'm returning the product that I got, which is [...] I can get for about $50 less, but that's not what I want for my nephew. The vendor I got it from (ToyBurg) shipped me a $20 toy for $75. I've notified Amazon already."
4,Really great for learning abc's,I would give this 5 stars if you didn't have to keep track of ALL of the letters of the alphabet. All ABC's are on your fridge and floor. My 21 month old daughter was given this for xmas and she loves it. She mostly loves pressing the same button over and over and over again. Each time she walks past the fridge she touches it. Love that it has 2 volume settings!
5,Fridge Phonics Magnetic Letter Set,This is one of the best items that I have purchased. I have a special needs child and he has played with this for 2 years now. I got a new one for our little daughter and they both sit and play with them together. It has taught my special needs child his letters as well as the sounds that they make. I have most all of the Leap Frog items and this is by far a favorite one for them.
5,learning letters is fun,My 5 year old daughter plays with this when we are getting dinner ready. She is leaning to spell out words and the sounds of letters with this system.
4,Amazing Instrumental and Vocal Combination Makes Head Spin,"After hearing Tommy Guererro's first album, I didn't think that there could be another like it. I was wrong! The follow up to his debut is incredible. The skateboarder turned songwriter absolutely kills it in this mixture of jazz and guitars. The lyrics to ""Mechanisms"" are mezmorizing. This is the kind of album that you can put on at a party and have people just chill out and relax to. You will also be getting many questions as to where they can pick up the album."
2,Not what I expected,"I have taken Barefoot Coral Calcium capsules in the past, but for a couple years have not been able to purchase the product in retail stores(ie: GNC). So I decided to try to purchase the capsules on-line. I chose to purchase through Amazon because I felt it would be safer (which it was); but, when I received the product I was very disappointed to see that I did not have capsules at all but ""Big yellow ""CAPLETS"" which are very hard for me to swallow! Since I'm on a fixed income, I figured it would be cheaper for me to just keep the pills rather than try to return the item. The Bob's Best Coral Calcium 2000mg caplets is:""NOT WHAT I ORDERED""!!"
4,Morning Light,"I really enjoyed the the arrangement on Chocolate groove. My favorite is Morning Light and Won't You Let Me Love You. It brought a sense of peace and sensitivity to me. Besides, it's good relaxing music."
5,Book Making for Families,"As a teacher, this book is a great resource for ideas to show students how to write and product there own work of literature. We used the book as the basis for a ""Make a Book Night"" sponsored by our PTA. Students and their parents attended a night of book making and story writing choosing from one of the many book ideas presented in the book. It was a great experience for one and all. If you love books, like to write poetry, stories or journals I highly recommend purchasingMaking Books That Fly, Fold, Wrap, Hide, Pop Up, Twist & Turn: Books for Kids to Make"
3,Like the Toyota Filters,"This seems to be the same as the Toyota brand filters I buy at the dealership, but this is a better price!"
5,Great cd!!,"I have only listened to my friend's copy of this cd, but I'm planning to go out and buy it today. This is one of the best songs in the world, especially if you're into rap or R&B. This is the only rap song I like except for Lauryn Hill, and this song doesn't have any profanity or ""other bad stuff."" It's great."
3,Fascinating topic; badly written,"I'm glad someone tackled this subject; I read a lot of criminal psych stuff and I've always wondered about this. I can't validate or disprove her conclusions though. They seem intuitively accurate though, how someone might want someone aggressive who can't hurt them. But her prose was really bad; I remember her using the phrase ""dizzying dance with death"" more than once, as if it was such a good line, she couldn't help but use it twice. It was very tabloid-ish. But I think this topic needs more serious research."
1,The Same Ole Stereotypes,"This book was nothing but the same old stereotypes: Women who love men in prison are mentally warped in some way through abuse, low self-esteem, blah blah blah. I wasn't impressed. The author's constant use of the title ""Master of Death"" to describe a prison who has killed is a bit dramatic. Not all are ""Masters of Death""; the author seems to put everyone in the same category as Ted Bundy or John Wayne Gacy. There are stories behind every crime, as there are human beings in prison. This book was overly-dramatic, judgmental, and reeks of condescendence. Maybe if the author had talked to some of the murderers, some of the family of the murderers, she would have been able to write a better book. Don't waste your time on this one."
3,Wrong size......,after speaking to cub cadet and mtd they told me order OEM-190-215-000...I did and it does NOT fit. My cub ltx 1054 has 22x9.50x12I rims. I can't seem to find weights anywhere for that size.
4,Great selection of songs.,"I wanted one song in particular - I'm Gonna Hire a Wino, Heard it years ago on tape, and then I heard the rest of David's songs and was very happy I had his album."
4,Ups and downs,"Being a collection of humorous short stories, this volume has ups and downs - some stories being well-written and funny, others less so. Guareschi's talent is undeniable; he opens this book by writing, ""My life began on the 1st of May, 1908, and between one thing and another, it still goes on."" This is written humor at its best.I think partially the fault for disliking a few of the stories lies in the way I've read them - I've read too many too fast; that's like eating too much chocolate. Perhaps a more paced reader will really enjoy this book and be able to give it a 5-star rating."
5,true classic,"What can you say about The Little World of Don Camillo? It's a true classic that warms you, is funny, and has marvelous characters! This book and it's companions are rarities, and worth treasuring."
4,Fairly Interesting,"This is the fourth volume of Turtledove's Darkness series. This series is a fantastical look at the Second World War, with dragons taking the place of aircraft, leviathans the place of submarines, and so on. I liked this book, it provides a good continuation to the series; Turtledove proves once again that you can't count on him to keep all his characters alive, and action is well-balanced, with a wide variety of viewpoints. The only problems that I saw were basically structural; we already know how the series will end, but undoubtably with a few curveballs thrown in too, and there were a few errors with characters being called by the wrong name, things like that. If you're just beginning this series, I recommend you start with the first book, otherwise you may totally be lost in terms of story. Good book if you have read the previous volumes, the series is getting a little long, though."
4,"Easy to read, informative, not enough practical guidance","This book is easy to read but it lacks example chart interpretations. While I could calculate how my Mercury can be quincunx to my Saturn, it would have helped if I could see a picture of such planetary positions. In addition, I found the book to be helpful in a general sort of way, but it did not offer much practical advice. Still, it was nice to have women-oriented astrological interpretations, although they were rather weakly expressed. Despite the above criticism, I liked the book for its detailed explanation of each planet and each of its position towards other planets in simple, friendly language."
5,Tape Worm Tabs,One dose did the trick...no more worms going on several weeks now. I did cut the tablet in half though to make it less likely to lodge in the cats throat and coated each piece with a little butter and was able to get it down him that way since other customers noted their cats would not eat it when mixed with food.Received item very quickly too from the seller...thanks!
5,Very effective!,Our cat had severe worm problems and we couldn't afford a vet visit so we researched the type of worms they were and found this product on Amazon.com. Other users said it worked well so we gave it a try and it was amazing! Overnight the worms quit coming out of the cat (and dying on the carpet all over the house) and she was much happier. We did have to have my wife hold the cat's mouth open while I force fed her the pill but it wasn't that difficult. We are very satisfied and would indeed purchase this product again.
2,Disappointed,"I don't think these worked very well. It was hard to get my kitty to take them, even though I halved the tablet and hid it in a treat. Finally got her to eat a whole one, and w/in a couple of weeks, I noticed worms again. Took her to the vet who told me the OTC products don't really work that well. I'll take her to the vet again next time and not bother w/these or other OTCs."
3,Tape Worm Tabs,The product arrived quickly. The pills are rather large so we had to break them up so it was easier for the cats to swallow.
3,Tape worm tabs for cats,"The shipping was quick. The tabs did not work. I googled more natural ways, that did the trick. I will not purchase the tabs if the need ever arises again."
1,Great songs but to short (some are one verse),"I love praise music. I've listened to many of these same songs by other artists over the years. The problem with this CD is that most of the songs are way too short. Some of the versions on this CD only have one verse when the original has several more. I'd pass over buying the CD. Sure, it has 25 songs. But they're sooooo short."
1,So Slooooooow,"I really can't begin to describe how slow the transfer rate of the Lexar firefly is. The transfer rate makes it nearly unusable for anything but a few small files. It can take literally HOURS to transfer 500 MB if it is a bunch of small files you are transferring. It is a little bit faster with fewer larger files. However, I recommend looking for something else. I am very disappointed with my purchase."
4,Definitely for the romantic at heart !!,"I purchased this CD as a Christmas present for my boyfriend because he is a Vandross fan and was specifically wanting the song, ""Always and Forever."" This CD is best to listen to when you're in the mood for romance. As a first-time listener to his music, I didn't particularily care for the CD too much because I would've preferred a blend of easy listening mood music and some upbeat faster music as alternates in between other songs. However, the songs were professionally sung and contained appropriate production methods. Vandross has an unmistakable style which sets him apart from other artists; so in that respect, and because there is limited availability of his music, it is well worth the purchase price. But, I have to say we'll be more likely to just play the one song, ""Always and Forever"" when we want to hear it rather than playing the whole CD."
1,Chipped - C D,I received the cd Always and Forever. It was dirty and chipped. I did not contact the seller. I just kepted it. I was schocked that it was so dirty and a big chip on the edge.
5,super,I WANTED TO KNOW IF HE SONG GOD GIVE ME ONE MORE CHANCE I NEED TO KNOW BECAUSE IT IS A GOOD SONG TO GET USE IN A WEDDING AND I COULD GO OUT AND BUY IT
5,An underappreciated talent,"The Face of the Tiger proves just how underappreciated columnist Mark Steyn really is. One part William F. Buckley Jr. (without the grandiose language) and one part P.J. O'Rourke (without the sarcasm), Steyn takes the best of both men by being a both a humourist and insightful. Yet despite that he's not as well known as either man, something that The Face of the Tiger will hopefully begin to remedy. The book collects his columns from September 11, 2001 to precisely one year later and primarily deals with the aftermath of the terrorist attacks. You can find him in the pages of The National Post and The Jerusalem Post as well as several other newspapers..."
2,Nifty Idea. Needs Modifications.,"It is a great idea but could use some tweaking. The legs are non-adjustable and are a little too high for use in bed, creating poor working ergonomics. Yes, you have the option to ship it back and have them saw the legs down to your desired height- but who wants to do that!? The legs also fold in easily and do not secure outward, creating instability on a mattress. Also, If you want to do homework on it, there is no way you can fit a book and a notebook on its surface. Not really worth the 80 bucks you pay after S&H."
5,"Space travel, black holes, river rapids, singing, sledding..","This author reminds me of two authors: Richard Brautigan (for adults) and Daniel Pinkwater (for kids). Just like Brautigan and Pinkwater, Pinkwater gives us a comic tale mixing realistic dialogue and surreal situations. This kid Steve is miffed because his mom is redecorating the house, and he doesn't like it until she shows him some spaceship wallpaper. You would not think a story about wallpaper could be exciting, but think again! Steve and his mom paper his bedroom with it, and that night, Steve has amazing adventures with some remarkably carefree spacemice, exploring the planet of the Bunnies (""don't do anything to get them mad""). Boldly illustrated by Jill Pinkwater. The hardcover jacket says ""ages 6-9,"" but I am 43 years old and I really enjoyed this book."
4,Snowjob,Enjoyed the story which had a good plot and I can recommend this book.One aspect which was quite irritating was the number of typing/grammatical errors.
5,A Must Read For Young African Women,"This book is definitely one of my top five favorite books. As a daughter of an African mother I could relate to many of the lessons that Shiri taught her daughter, Zenzele. However through her narrative method of telling the story, I felt as if I learned so much more. I felt comforted by her words and this is a book I will most definitely find myself referencing throughout the rest of my life. From love, relationships, education, career choices, everything that young women face is addressed in this book. I highly recommend it. I absolutely LOVED it!"
5,"OK, I'm a FAN","Hard to not love a writer who answers email from hundreds of fans a year, including me. That said, if you watch or read him, you know that his insights into the human condition frequently give pause, smiles and tears; and that's totally outside of the action. This book is a must read for anyone developing skills as a screenwriter. You'll get an idea you can use on just about every page."
2,Very Disappointed,"I am extremely disappointed in this product. Growing up with Care Bears, I was excited to introduce them to my 3 year old daughter. This toy, however, is not worth the money. You have to press really hard to get the figures to stay in the cars and then the cars don't even stay on the ferris wheel as it is spinning. The music is also very, very loud and choppy. Overall, a very annoying and overpriced toy."
3,This Toy Makes a lot of Noise,"This ferris wheel makes a ton of noise. And the cloud carts fall off easily, making it difficult for smaller children who can't easily put them back on. My girls play with the little care bears that came with this set separately but don't have the patience to set up the ferris wheel. They came out with a newer version of this toy that works A LOT better!"
3,Roach is always fun,"I still can't get over the quality of Roach's writing. She takes her subject very seriously without removing the humor and mystery. If she wrote high school science textbooks, I might now understand biology, chemistry, and physics."
2,"Spoiled by ""Stiff""","""Stiff"" was the first book of Roach's I read, so this book had big shoes to fill ... and it didn't. As far as my complaints about the book, it was simply boring."
1,Boring - Avoid this Book!,"I love ghost stories and stories of the 'beyond' and all that those categories entail. That said, I hate this book. Mary Roach has the authorial voice of a 12 year old. I read the first chapter thinking, 'wow, this book might as well have been edited by a middle school yearbook writer.' There are a plethora of books on the market dealing with this subject matter. Pick any of them. Leave Mary Roach on the bookshelf."
1,A Science Book?,"Why, oh Why, did I buy another book from this author? I read ""Packing for Mars"", I should've known better than to buy another one.I blame myself, I already knew her style, I already knew she tries to be funny at least once every sentence (sometimes succeeding, but wow... relentless), and I already knew that ""Science"" is not really part of her genre, regardless of what her titles suggest.What's bad?Well... endless text is given to such ridiculousness as seances, ectoplasm, and such dribble.What's good?It ends. But even then I was faced with the grim reality of my actions. I bought a second book by Mary Roach.That is exactly like sticking your hand in a fire for the second time. Hurts, and serves you right."
2,"A lot of hard work, but most of the compiled facts are junk science.",Disappointing that she worked so hard and spent so much time on collecting junk science facts and a lot of quacks' non-objective research/information.
