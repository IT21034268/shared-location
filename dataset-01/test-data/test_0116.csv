1,SAVE YOUR MONEY,"This girl has absolutly no talent at all! She sounds like a dying goose. The songs arn't bad, but her voice is so awful, you can't even begin to like them. PLEASE SAVE YOUR MONEY!"
2,Can she carry her voice?,"This is not the first time that someone has come out with a cd like this one. We have heard it before. I didn't mind the catchy songs; they were catchy. However, everytime she went to carry her voice, it seemed that the backup vocals were magically turned up. I have heard her sing, and for a 17 year old, she's not that bad. However, on ""Baby one more time"", I believe we heard more of her unnoted back-up singers than anything. Maybe next time, she will have enough confidence to sing by herself."
3,YOUR KID SISTERS BRITNEY,"All in all, I like this Brit better than the new Brit. There is something to be said for good pop songs. Max Martin and the rest of those guys that were writing for Britney, and the boy bands of the time wrote some amazing songs. ""Born to Make You Happy"" would have been a giant hit if released as a single. So what if the Sonny and Cher remake is horrid, as is Soda Pop..the rest of the album works. By the time 2001's BRITNEY came out the trademark sound of Max Martin was gone..even though he did contribute a couple songs..they weren't as good as this or ""...Oops I Did It Again""."
1,... ...,"Britney has a good look, so I expect this CD to sound great! However, after listening to the CD I felt rather disappointed. Britney's voice doesn't sound natural enough (though the melody of the songs is terrific). She seems to force her voice out of her mouth and nose."
2,Switch job,"I understand that mistakes can be made, but, there is a big difference in the words ""Brittny Spears"" and ""Gwen Stefani"" not even real sure it came from USA.Update: The manufacturer was wonderful at getting the proper CD to the girl that wanted. He went out of his way to correct the error."
4,Britney has pretty good music,"Britney spears has pretty good music. Her voice is okay, but some of the songs i just found anoyying. I did not like the song ""Soda Pop."" I also didn't like her version of ""And The Beat Goes On."" All of her other songs i thought were pretty good. My favorite song of hers is From th ebottom of my broken heart. If you like pop music and you think that dance music is fun you should definetely buy this cd."

5,Great cd if you're young and in love......,"This is a great cd if you're in love (with a boyfriend or have a crush) but if you think love is stupid, and dumb you wouldn't like this cd. The cd is cute and practically all the song are related to love like Hit Me Baby One more time, E-mail my Heart, and Crazy. I recommend this cd for ages 10-15 if you're older than 15 chances are you won't like it because this cd is kind of ages 10-15. If you're younger than 10 you won't understand what Britney's message is or if you're older you will see what I mean and the lyrics are childish. Other than that this was a good debut album for Britney Spears."
4,"Yup, its pretty good!","Well, there are some fillers in there. But Britney definately matures on the second album. The best song on this cd is ""Born To Make You Happy"", yes, its so beautiful you almost wanna cry! The lyrics are really expressive. E-mail my heart is good for the email generation and Baby one more time Crazy, FTBOMBH are all good tunes. sometimes is really sweet!"
1,"Golly, what a dummy who is poster child for Satanism","How we know the sales of this bimbo's record is that it was in the newspapaers(chuckles) like every stunt she pulls to keep her name in the media. No one likes this Spears character anymore. Her erratic behavior destroyed her(chuckles). Most teen stars fall from grace(laughs) and she makes me look like Einstein. Come Judgment Day, her hide will be sent to where the Devil lays as will her blind fans like the previous 5-star fellow! Anyhow, this record is like bubblegum, tasty one minute and disgusting the next!"
1,SORRY IT'S NOT WORTH YOUR MONEY,BRITNEY SPEARS NEED TO GROW MORE VOCALLY BEFORE PEOPLE NAME HER QUEEN OF POP! IF YOUR REALLY INTERESTED IN PURCHASING A GOOD ALBUM PICK UP CHRISTINA AGUILERA. SHE'S A GREAT SINGER AND HAS AN EXCELLENT VOICE. PLUS SHE'S MORE DOWN TO EARTH. SORRY BRITNEY BUT YOUR NOT ALL THAT
2,Deja Vu? The next Tiffany!!,"Once again we see the next Tiffany. Britney Spears is conquering teen girls all across America. She is the perfect example of selling out which usually doesn't happen until your 3rd or 4th record. Jive usually signs good acts but please!! Stop the trend with the hiring kids from The Mickey Mouse club and sign someone with a fresher attitude. She has a good beatiful voice but she is losing her identity in the process of singing songs that have no meaning. And isn't she a little young and new to be covering a classic song, ""The Beat Goes On""? She is trying to hard to live up to everyones expectations and losing herself in the process."
1,My God...can this be considered music?,"Okay. One of the best ways to waste twelve, thirteen, or even fourteen dollars is to go out and buy this CD. Sorry, but personally, I can't stand this little ""singer"" who has so recently seemed to dazzle everybody with her...ahem... amazing voice. Her lyrics are incredibly shallow and it hurts my ears to hear them. What's even sadder is that some people look up to her as an idol. If you wanna be a wannabee, at least choose somebady worthwhile- not a girl who can't sing and can't dance with only a pretty face on her side. She has absolutely no talent. I'd give it a zero, but I can't..."
5,This album is really great!!!,I just want to say that this album is excellent!!! Number 11 was a really stupid song but the rest is great and deserves to be bought!
1,"Dumb, vacant, and completely empty.","The only other recording artist I can think of that is this gormless and still able sell a geegol of albums and sustain a large fan base is Missy Elliot. The tragic thing about Elliot juxtaposed to Spears is that Elliot is ten years Spear's senior. All that's given here to the listener is a bunch of prosiac tunes and a drum machine. Oh yeah, and for all of you who think that Spears emphaszies sleazy style over substance, your right. In case any ""loaded"" readers have joined us, I'm reffering to last month's Rolling Stone cover. I'm presuming that when Spears wrote the lyrical bank to this piece of unremarkable commercial dreck; she had some help from The Missing Link, because nobody who's just inches away from adulthood could be this dumb. Britany Spears, if your reading this; just pose for playboy and become a fading memory, please, for all of us who care about music."
1,I tried to give it a chance...,"I admit that Britney Spears is one of the hottest teen pop stars today... she has sold millions of records around the world and nobody can deny that... However, her album is really nothing to jump up and down about...The first single (...baby one more time) was pretty good, but the rest of her songs are sort-of lame and too bubblegumish... Her voice is too ""airy"" and it seems like there is no real feeling behind it..."
4,Great cd with cewl multimedia stuff,"This cd is pretty good overall. It has the two hits ""Baby One More Time"" and ""Sometimes"". The new hit ""Crazy"" differences from the single release. It's still good but not so good as the single release wich is the ""Stop Remix"" of the song. Besides these tracks there is one other superb track called ""Born To Make You Happy"" wich I think will be the next single. Other tracks are overall good exept track 4 : Soda Pop. This one is very weird and not good. Also track 12: ""The beat goes on"", wich is from the Sonny & Cher song is not good either. But hey, these are the only 2 bad songs on the entire cd. So if you like Britney Spears, BUY IT. You won't regret it. P.S. It has the complete videoclip of ""Baby One More Time"" on it and other cewl pictures when she was a little girl etc..."
1,No Vocal Skills,"What are these people talking about? I've heard better teen albums from Debbie Gibson than I've heard from Britney. What makes anybody think that this tired child can sing? True, she has maybe five songs that I like which are worth mentioning. ""Baby, One More Time"", ""Sometimes,"" ""From The Bottom Of My Broken Heart"", ""Born To Make You Happy"" and ""Crazy"". The only reason somebody said that this is the best pop teen album is because they have no taste in music.Where did she think that she learned how to sing? The album is garbage without those five tracks that I mentioned. I swear that America needs a brain transplant. I may have all four of Britney's albums, but that's purely because I like what I hear. I don't love what I hear-merely like. She needs to hang up singing and leave it up to the professionals."
1,Lame...very lame,I really don't understand how anyone could give this album good ratings. Firt of all she can't sing. Her voice sounds so electronical and made up. The songs are lame. Email my heart i would have to say is the worst song i've ever heard in my life. This album is beyond lame. It just plain sucks. I would not go out and buy it if i were you.
1,Terrible,"It appears that after many years of Boy Bands as the favourite weapon of musical criminal Max Martin, he has found himself a muse that no only inspires his uninspired and crudely written 'music', but is the ultimate weapon for his musical crimes.Filler would have been a good title for this very bad album. Too much sounds the same and it is not anywhere near the terms ""experimental"" or ""artistic"". This is almost definately Max's most vicious crime. If the UN held trials for his evil, they would definately find him guilty.Hopefully Britney will find better producers and writers, but for now Max is her man."
4,pretty good,"I think that Britney is a very talented singer, I like her catchy songs and her funky music videos, how ever not all the songs on this album were good. why! I could probably come up with beats catchier than ""email my heart"" my self. ""Some times"", ""from the bottam of my broken heart"", ""Crazy"",and ""Babey one more time"" are very good, however I have no clue why some of the other songs were on there. some of the songs are sort of good. well thats just my opinion."
5,The best CD of Brit!,"This is the best CD of Miss. Britney Spears yet! I have 3 CDs of her, this one, Oops!, and Britney. And I have to say this one is one of my favorites of her! All of the songs are reallygood on here except I don't like her remake of Cher's song ""The beat goes on."" I don't know why, I just don't like that song! I recommend that you buy this CD today if you don't have it. I admit I used to hate Britney but now I'm a BIG fan of her and I luv her! Thankyou for taking time to read my review. Bye bye!"
2,YAWN!!!!,"Britney Spears' first c.d. was her worst out of the first three. I don't own it,(thank God) but I listened to it @ my friends house who actually LIKES it. It's very, very boring. All the songs sound the same, and Britney sounds horrible. Her voice was soooooo fake. It was totally different then what it is right now. The only reason I gave this piece of trash two stars was because I liked the songs baby one more time and crazy. Everything else totally sucked. I do like Britney Spears however, and I own Oops... and Britney, and those two are so much better then this one. Unless you are a huge fan of Britney Spears and devote your whole life to her, don't bother buying it."
1,Slip,"Looks like this album is already starting to become uncool. Check up on those stars up there...are we under four now? Unbelievable..I swear it was much higher a month ago. All you kids, listen to Dad's Zeppelin albums, or try to find your OWN group. It is hard to do, but satisfying when you can turn your friends onto somebody's music that you enjoy, and FOUND for yourself. This music is ok once in a while...to laugh at and joke about. Do you not understand that Vanilla Ice=Spears=Mandy moore=new kids on the block=leif=no staying power?"
1,SHE WANTS TO GET HIT ONE MORE TIME!,"""Baby One More Time"" is probably the only decent song on this cd, and even THAT is bad! She's talking about domestic violence, that can't be a good message to girls. Some of the titles to the songs are just so laughable, like ""Email My Heart."" GAWD! Her voice is fully computerized, she sounds terrible live. At least Mandy Moore TRIES to sing and doesn't lip synch! Britney may be a very pretty girl but she is a total airhead and all she can do is look good and NOT sing. Thank gawd for TALENTED artists such as Jessica Simpson and Christina Aguilera, who have brains and are REAL BLONDS!"
3,pretty good but not terrific,"If you like pop music like I do,you will like this cd.The only bad song is E-mail My Heart.That has to be the dumbest song.The rest of the songs are pretty good.On the other hand,Britney's voice leaves something to be desired."
3,I Will Not Lie...,"...I like Britney Spears. Sure, I know she can't sing to save her life, but you have to admit that she has great production. Her debut cd is just that: A debut cd. It's not great, but it's not horrible either. Nothing compares to ...BABY ONE MORE TIME, but then again, few songs (PERIOD) do.My favorite cuts are:...BABY ONE MORE TIME (obviously)SODA POP (a weirdly infectious song that gets in your head and stays there)BORN TO MAKE YOU HAPPY (a single in the UK but should've replaced that gawd-awful song SOMETIMES here)THE BEAT GOES ON (A cover of Cher's hit. Not a bad one either, but of course, nothing compares to Cher)I own every Britney Spears cd (and I'm not ashamed to admit it) and this one ranks as the second best."
3,Britney keep on working!,"Ok,it's real hard to say that it's my favorite cd.But I can't say it's bad too.In my view Britney's voice is not definitely the best but it's ok.Some of her tracks are really good for me-'Baby one more time','Crazy' with the fantastic beat and one more fav 'Born to make you happy'and also 'The beat goes on'.So it's a relatively good debut album I think.But the other songs seem all the same,somehow even senseless.Britney got a lot of work more on her vocals,style and live appearances .So go on Britney!"
4,This cd is alright!!,"When I first got this cd, I listened to it, it was really awesome. It was one of my favorite cd but then after awhile it gets kinda of boring. However, this cd can still shake a party. The real reason I really bought this cd is because I thought Britney Spears is really hot but I found out the music is not bad. I would recommended to people who like to dance...all types, mostly slow."
2,UMMMMMMM NO,Yikes why did I even waste my money??? I guess it wasn't horrible I've heard worse but the only really good songs are Sometimes and From the Bottom of My Broken Heart. E-Mail My Heart is incredibly lame and her voice isn't anything great. Also she is supposed to be a teenage role model? I think not!
1,"5 star or 1 star, I see..","I can see most reviewers rate this cd 1 star or 5 star. I understand because this album is perfect commercial album and if it sells no matter what, B.S. wins. And she(and thousands of production staff) won totally. They did what they tried to do. But I just don't care about her, I love GOOD music not best-selling music. And if I was 15 years boy with pinple all over my face, I would difinitely buy this CD and dream about her in dream...You know everybody has this period like chicken pox. Right? Right."
3,Great CD,Britney Spears is very talented. I did buy this CD and loved it. But i wont let my 2 daughters watch her videos or anything she's on.Because of the way she dresses. But i will give the CD 3 stars.Jack EllisDCW CRITICS@onebox.com
2,Not ALL That!,"Britney Spears has the looks, & the pop songs that make you wanna dance. But she lacks vocal talent, BIG TIME. She trys too hard to sound seductive, but she just sounds stupid. Calling her the ""Queen of Pop"" is just too soon, & should have never been brought up in the first place. For real music w/ vocal talent, go buy Aalyah's ""One In A Million"" or Monica's ""The Boy Is Mine."""
3,...Baby One More Time? I Hope Not,"Well, I like a few songs that stick in your head, and I'm even a fan of the sappy ""Email My Heart"", but some tunes, like ""Soda Pop"" and the cheesey duet with Don Phillips has to go. There needs to be more polished hits like the title track and less cheese and whine."
1,Wait a minute...,"The only reason that people don't like this album is because they cannot empathize with Britany and the profound lyrical emotion that lies beneath...oh wait...sorry, nevermind."
1,"No talent, bad singing, repetitive songs make this a failure","This CD is repetitive and badly done, with no evidence of real talent. With songs that are about nothing other than love, guys, and completely commonplace,this is uninteresting and boring to listen too. Maybe she should stop trying to sing and just do photos, considering that that is all she does anyway. Very definition of a ""one hit wonder."""
2,It's ok,"Britney Spear's songs are ok, but she won't make it long if she has a weak little voice like i heard when she was singing live on MTV, Nickelodeon Awards, and the Rosie O' Donnel show. What amazing things they are doing w/ computers these days. I would appreciate her more if she actually written at least some of her songs. But she seems like a nice girl and just trying to make it in the world w/ her looks. So good luck Britney!"
5,A great CD that everyone will like.,"This is a great CD that all will like. ""Baby one more time"" may be the only hit on the CD, but all the rest of the songs are just as good. The words are well written. The beat is cool, and it is fun to dance to! The slow beat songs like ""born to make you happy"" are just as good as the faster beat songs like ""soda pop."" This is a great CD that everyone will enjoy!"
1,"1hit 1der. The music industry wont ""hit her one more time""","She's not worth what she's getting. She's shallow and she can't sing. She's loved for her dancing and maybe that catchy tune or bass piano line. ""It's"" all about the music, and she's not. I would've given this 0 *s if I could have, but that 1 * is for ,well, trying (and failing)."
1,I'm sorry but gross.........,"Now i know some of you teenyboppres may enjoy this mindless rubbish,but really,it is for the unintelligent 8-12 year old group.She is doing really well for herself but if you enjoy meaningfull music you ain't gonna dig this.Honestly,Hanson is a better group,they make timeless meaningfull brilliant soulful music for everyone to listen to."
2,Not very good music!,"This CD isn't very good because a lot of people were fooled by the ...Baby One More Time song, and the rest of the music is sooo bad it'll put you to sleep! If you compare Debbie Gibson(who, by the way, actually has talent)with Brittany Spears(who doesn't have any)you are making a big mistake."
1,A ABSOLUTE MESS!,"Spears is very produced and belongs in the Hall of Shame with Milli Vanilli, Stacey Q and Vanilla Ice. A shaky voice at best Spears will fade so fast, she won't leave a dent."
5,Britney Spears is awesome!,All my friends love Britney Spears and I had to listen to her. One day I turned on the radio and she was on it. I was amazed because most of the artists today sing about horrible stuff like in KORN and stuff. I just wanted to get away from that. Britney Spears is one of the very few today that actually sings good songs. I think that she is a great artist and if you don't have this CD listen to a sample clip. I think you will really like this. 5-23-99
2,"she's hot, she's cute, but she sure is fake","There's no denying that the sight of a gorgeous, surgically enhanced, tanned-to-perfection 17-year-old girl doesn't make any one do a double take. But, when that same young lady is supposed to be a role model to millions of adolescents across the nation, something's definitely wrong. After listening to this album, it's obvious the most marketable hits are ""..Baby One More Time"", ""Crazy"", and ""Sometimes"". Now, I won't deny that they're great for the kiddies to dance to, but I wish that Ms.Spears concentrated more on being a positive influence on America's youth, rather than being marketed as America's Playmate of the Year."
1,Why I can't put 0 star??,"This is some real crap music, well I don't even know if this is real music. This is only about marketing, Britney just want money, she don't even care about you. Believe me, don't buy this crap. If you want something good, go buy a CD from the Aquabats. Ska RULEZZZZZZZZZZZZ. Go SKANK in peace my friend."
5,I would give more stars is I could,"This Album is the best album she has produced ...Ooops I did itagian was not good and ...Britney is a geat album but ...Baby Onemore time is the best album ever if you are trying to decide ...Baby one more time is the Best...Baby one More Time = The BEST song on the albumYou Drive me Crazy = Great Song but overplayedSometimes = The second best song on the albumSoda Pop = Perrty Bad {A Filler}From the Bottom of my Broken Heart = Great SongE-Mail My Heart = Great SongThe Beat Goes on = Album FillerAs you can see there are some Album Fillers but those other songsmake up for it 1,000,000 Times!"
4,"fun popsongs,pity about the..","..singer!! Hi.I try not to dislike Britney,i even try to like her sometimes,but,i gotta tell ya,its freaking hard!Why didnt she stay sweet anyway?Why does she carry on like a tart and do strips and stuff,(and her mother lets her get away with it all),and its all A-Ok as long as she smiles and says shes a virgin at the end of the day. But onto the album,omigod,I love her songs!She has a terrible voice but the songs are so cool,really catchy.I dont have the Cd.I know someone whose got it.They usually listen to Sometimes and Baby and miss the rest saying it is boring.If you like fun pop,you should probably get it."
4,"A comprehensive review on ""...Baby, One More Time""","This is the best album I've heard from a teenager yet. Sure, she didn't write the songs, but her voice is fantastic. Tracks 1, 2, and 5 are particularly strong musically although most of the album has a sort a day-dreamy feel to it(Track 11 in particular). I have learned to play all but a couple of these songs on the bass guitar and would love to have the opportunity to play behind her in concert."
1,horrible!,"this was a rotten teeny-bopper cd. i listened to it over at my friend's house and was gagging at the first song. all the songs are cheesy and terrible(hit me baby one more time...what does that mean?) and my friend hates it too. don't buy it. it's a complete waste of money, unless you like the sound of someone swallowing rocks..."
2,ugh,"I'll give her credit for the effort that I hope she put into this CD. But, when I listen to it, all I can say is ew. To all the britney fans out there, I am not jealous of her, I definatly DON'T like her music! Sure, shes had a couple of hits, but all I'm going to say is that Britney Spears is going down the drain. I'd rather listen to Christina Aguilera or Jennifer Lopez any day (that's real talent that they have there! )"
2,"""Sometimes"" is nice, but Britney Spears is not for me!","Sorry, fans, but this girl is a little too sexy for young girls. If you people out there don't care about what I'm saying, that's fine."
2,"Nice Face, Vocals Barely There","Britney spears is pretty, but her singing is still under-developed and her style- way too much of what's current to qualify as evergreen material.The songs, very catchy, but repetitive in the way they sound.What we have here is an album of a young singer trying to get the best public image possible and match that with songs that complement that image.Nothing wrong with that but still it isn't a particularly strong album though. I wonder if anyone will remember any of these songs 10 to 20 years from now.Well, what she needs is a classic number- and i'm not talking about recycling songs- and maybe a voice that is as distinctive as Barbra Streisand's.Is that impossible- not for me to say but whoever said being a recording artiste is an easy job?"
2,Nothing to shout about.,"I have to say that Britney has a good voice, but her music is typical, overproduced, teenybopper-pop without a shred of depth. There are some decent dance tracks, but that's ALL they are, dance tracks. The rest is flat, unoriginal filler tracks.Born to Make You Happy is just a really sad attempt at a love song that ends up promoting the prehistoric idea that women are born to serve men. E-mail My Heart is just lame--it tried to be a ""'90s"" love song but the lyrics are just plain corny.The problem with all those I love you...I miss you...yada yada yada songs is that except for variations in the regrettably unoriginal lyrics, they are all pretty much the same: E-mail My Heart, Born To Make You Happy, From the Bottom of My Broken Heart...if anyone wants to point out to me one major difference between these songs, well, feel free.All in all, this cd is pretty pathetic."
3,Review from Rebecca,Mixes are a great way to get out of buying one album with one good song on it. This album takes those one-hit-aritst's good songs onto one CD. This is a album you will want ot listen to again and again.
1,Misleading....Shame on Sybersound,"So, I purchased this under the impression it was a karaoke cd. One I had been looking for, no where on this packaging does it state that these are original renditions by HORRIBLE singers. I thank the seller for being honest that it was in good condition, but I am pissed that sybersound is so misleading, producing some karaoke and others not, changing the names of cd's and re-releasing them with different songs. Not cool."
2,Chinese Checkers function follows form,"This is a beautiful wooden board, and the intent when purchased was to use it to play the game. The marbles that came with the game were very pretty, and matched the colors on the board, but the colors didn't stand out. Three of us played, but it was very hard to distinguish the color of the marbles. Except for the white marbles, they all looked too close to the same (light blue, dark blue, green all looked very close in color, and the yellow and red looked close in color to each other). We had to hold the marble to the light to see what color it was.The nice thing is that other marbles could be purchased for use and wouldn't be a big expense. And it is a beautiful game board and you can hang it on the wall."
5,Kevin Welch CD,"This is a wonderful CD. I love all the songs. His music is so amazing. Great lyrics, beautiful sound. Kevin has a beautiful voice and is a passionate singer. I recommend this CD. This is one of his best. I believe it is my favorite. I have all his CDs."
4,Great product,"As far as kids, they love it ... period. For me, I like that the bottom of the ""tent"" is the actual bed sheet so regular washing is easy. We had to convince our youngest to sit down before getting out of bed though as the elastic on that side can be a trip hazard. I don't see this as an issue if you have carpet in the room but even if you have flooring, it was an easy adjustment. We don't want them jumping out of bed anyway but they do get a little excited when playing in the tent."
5,My & year old LOVES this,After reading reviews on many tents I bought this one for my 7 year old for Christmas. Very easy to put up and well made. My little girl loves this she will sit in it for hours and read a book or play with her toys. All her friends that come over think it is the coolest thig ever! I would buy it agine in a sec!
4,"fresh, good quality",Just like the local pet shop sells and at 1/3 our local price. very fresh and the bird loves it.
4,An outstanding depiction of the civil war era.,"This book really makes the era come to life. There is excellent plot and character development. Unlike other books, this one has a sequel that is actually BETTER than the original. As good as this book is, it gets better. It's a shame it was only a 2-part series. Look Away has it all - Action, suspense, drama, romance (this IS a clean book, sorry harlequin readers.)."
3,a let-down,"One disconnected battle scene after another. After about the twentieth battle I lost interest-- and I like a lot of action in books. The first half of the book has interesting character development, good plot, but then the last half of the book became quite monotonous. PLUS you have to read the sequel to even find out what happens to the two main characters! What a rip!"
2,There's no real need to get this - buy 1200 Curfews instead.,"Whereas ""4.5"" contains most of the songs that have videos or were released as singles, this particular album is no where near a ""must have"" for indigo fans. A indigo CD called ""Starter Kit"" is available in the US that covers a smaller ""best of"" listing. ""4.5"" offers no insight or no new versions of the songs; it is merely one person's idea of an indigo collection straight off previously released material. If you seriously enjoy the indigos, then buy ""1200 Curfews"". That CD gives you a glimpse of the indigo power live. It has alternate versions and unreleased material. There is no need to get ""4.5"", especially at the cost of an import."
1,The Steve Goodman Trio and Steve Goodman are NOT THE SAME!,"This is really a note to Amazon.com advising them that they should really differentiate the artists better than they do. When looking up Steve Goodman, the folk singer, the Steve Goodman Trio jazz group should not be listed. This is very confusing to your customers, and although I recognize that this might be a limitation of your search engine, a better way to differentiate should be looked into."
1,All the ingredients but no direction,"Emperor's technical prowess shines through, but not much more. The concepts and poetic nature to their songwriting has all but vanished, leaving in its place circular songs that schizophrenic collide with themselves in order to somehow achieve resolution. Beneath the flashy production and instrumentalism, there isn't enough here to keep the interest of an active mind. You might buy it, but you'll turn it into a coaster after a few weeks of this repetitive bore. Avoid!!!"
5,greatest black metal album of all time,"never before has a group of musicians produced something so jagged, heavy and dark yet hauntingly beautiful. this is the only album i listen to everyday of my life, from start to finish.if you want the flambouyant guitar solo, dont look here. instead, expect complicated song structure (in the vein of classical music), the best vocals ever in metal provided by ihsahn, insane beast like drumming from trym and perhaps best of all, the greatest usage of synths on an album, which is nothing short of legendary.all hail ihsahn, samoth, trym and alver for creating the best black metal album ever."
4,Great Black Metal from a great band,This is a great solid recommandation from one of the best black metal bands ever to grace this planet.
5,EMPEROR!!!!!!!,"i love this album. Instrumentally, its one of the best things Emperor has ever done. The keyboards and synths help to create a very eerie, atmospheric sound. The guitars and drumming are great as always. The vocals are the same, but with singing added. this piece of music was definitely a step in the right direction for Emperor. Buy it now and give Emperor some money they rightly deserve for their efforts."
3,a very well put together album,"This was the first black metal album i picked up, so i did not know what to expect. When i popped the cd into my cd player, i wasnt impresses. And so the cd sat on my shelf until i decided to give it a second listen. Upon my second listening i liked the cd alot more. Tracks like 'The loss and curse of Reverance' and 'With Strength i Burn' a very very good. The rest of the album is mediocre. All in all, its a nice work of orchestrated black metal."
3,interesting,"Some explanations seem rather corny = a far stretch. Is there such an author as ""Jordan Almond""?There seem to be a few books out there extremely similar, page for page."
4,Not what I was expecting but it's good,"Since Amazon doesn't have track listings or samples for this album, I bought it based pretty much entirely on the album's rating. Because it's described as a ""split EP"", I wasn't sure if it was a collaboration between the two bands or more of a promotional thing with singles from both bands, like The Anniversary and Superdrag once put out. For anyone who's curious like I was, this album is in fact a collaboration between the two bands and it's basically a single for a 15 minute song, with two 5 minute remixes. Neither remix really caught my attention but the original song it definitely worth a listen. But if I had know what I was buying, I would have just bought the original version of the song for a dollar. I guess that's what I get for not checking out the MP3 offerings.Whenever You See Fit 14:29Whenever You See Fit (DJ Dynomite D Mix) 4:57Whenever You See Fit (Scientific American Mix) 5:37"
3,Heavy on Characters - Light on Plot,"Jock, Jeff or Jerry? A handsome clever con man insinuates himself into the lives of many women - unfortunately one of them is going insane. If the plot had stayed with these women only, we might have had a great story, but the author put just too many characters and their story lines into this unsatisfying read. These secondary story lines take away from the main and we are bogged down with non-pertinent information.This book, as was the last one I read, ""The Birthday Present"" a let down. After I finish the last of the Rendell's on my bookshelf, there will be no more. Ironically, it is the first she ever wrote."
4,Dysfunction at its Finest!,"I found this a fascinating read, but more of a character study of dysfunction than a mystery.At the heart of this story is Jock, also known as Jeff or Jerry, a ne'er do well always looking for a free lunch. His girlfriend du jour is always well-off, and willing to keep him.The three women at the forefront of this novel have very little in common, except that they all have fallen head over heels for Jock, or Jerry, or whatever he decides his name is! What we do discover about these women, and those people who are close to them, are the various dysfunctions and quirks that manifest themselves as the story progresses.I don't think I would characterize this book as a mystery, as there is very little kept secret from the reader. As a novel, however, it is very good, and Rendell's depictions of her characters are fascinating."
3,Here are All the Lonely People,"Ruth Rendell's Adam and Eve and Pinch Me has all the ingredients that have made her novels so compelling but, in this one, the parts do not make for as fulfilling a whole as one expects from such a skilled writer. There is the usual cast of fascinating (not likeable) characters with more than the usual assortment of compulsions and deceits driving them and the plot. At times, the quirks seem a little forced as even very minor characters are burdened with a glaring oddity or two, taking the heat from the major characters. The suspense is toned down to focus on the psychology and too much of the plot is telegraphed. A tighter, narrower focus on a lesser number of characters could have been more compelling. It is still a good read but not as good as one should expect from the author of the wonderful Wexford series, as well as her other delicious, weird mysteries."
4,A Classic Romance for Today,"Hundreds of thousands of visitors trod the downtown streets andshops of Lititz, PA and always proclaim its charm and beauty. Thoseof us who live here often wish those visitors would take away more of the character of our community. Liz Curtis Higgs, a Lititz native, does her home town proud by delivering the feel and the character of our community as a backdrop to an interesting and exciting love story. Join us in watching two perfect opposites learn how to build a lasting bond by dovetailing their lives and their love. Liz is a master story teller who is able to teach history, relationships and religion while entertaining. END"
5,Great Series,This book is amazing! The whole Dragonlance Chronicles series is very good. I recommend this book to everyone.
3,Not There Yet...,"Split Enz are a great band but they weren't at their Mental Notes excellence here, not quite anyway. Still, great for Enz fans!"
2,Still confused,"I purchased this book, with the expectation that I would have a better understanding of us together once I completed it.Well here I am and I have no more of a clearer understanding then I did when I started the darn book. The intentions and ideas of writing this book was excellent, but the content was lacking. It was more prejudice then stereotypical. I am not sure that she interviewed people from all walks of life creed and color in the so-called focus group.My hope is that someone else will take the wonderful idea here and run with it. Bringing us positive feedback."
1,Don't waste your money,"Black people may like this book and appreciate the message, but if you're non-black it will just make you sick. This book is nothing but a rant against all white people. The title and jacket cover claim to provide a balanced approach, but there is precious little input from ""whites"".Ms. Williams seems to think that ""whites"" are to blame for every little set back, disappointment, and inconvenience in her life. Since she's so fed up with this country I suggest she move somewhere else and quit her whining."
3,ok,"as a collector of disney diecast cars, we needed to add these guys to the collection. they are cute and detailed, but the helmet does not stay in place on the buzz car at all. it's ok for our purposes as we just have them sitting on a shelf. but if your intention is to have these in use, count on the cheap little plastic helmet disappearing."
3,"Cute, but Buzz car has issues","Woody car is great, Buzz car has issues. Helmet does not stay attached to car."
5,Excellent,"This CD has four different versions of Pump up the Volume, plus a song that would be better off never having existed in first place.So, basically, it's a matter of whether you like Pump up the Volume or not. To me, this is one of the greatest tecnho/dance songs ever. I just can't get tired of it."
4,Works great!,"So far, I've used these for peppercorns and various varieties of sea salt. I prefer my peppercorns to be ground a little finer than this one grinds (after all, it's a course grinder), but the course grinders grind my sea salt perfectly -- just the way I like it. I'll use these course grinders for my salts and the the Kyocera Mill with the white or black tops for my peppercorns. I highly recommend Kyocera Mills!"
5,Vivid picture of a post-war America way ahead of its time!,"Alright, most sci-fi fans have seen all the post-apocalyptic movies and played the video games, so seeing or reading about ruined cities is nothing new anymore. This tale though was a real trail-blazer, being written just after the birth of the atomic age. The stories central protagonist (Fors) is believable and deep enough to connect with. The strongest attribute of Daybreak is Norton's vivid and living descriptions of the ruined world of the future. One really gets the feeling that they are seeing the ruined planet through the eyes of the young mutant. I have read this novel about a half a dozen times now and each time I get lost in the descriptions.This is a simple read that is a lot of fun, check it out!"
2,The Road To Camlann,"This story is about the death of King Arthur and his noble knights trying to protect him. Some characters in this story are King Arthur, Queen Gueneveer, Sir Mordred, Sir Gawain, and Sir Lancelot. Sir Mordred is King Arthur's evil son. The story took place in the Middle Ages, and the setting was in Camelot. This story was very boring because there were never any exciting parts. The most exciting part I would say is a jousting battle between Sir Gawain and Sir Lancelot. That's not exciting because it doesn't even give any specific details. Another reason you shouldn't waste your time on this book is because some of the wording is very hard to understand. The sentences are formed differently and it uses some words you may not understand. For example, you probably know this word but they use ""thus"" a lot and it gets to be very annoying. In conclusion, I don't think you should read this book because it's boring and hard to understand; therefore you should not read this book."
4,Special Operations,"The second of the Badge of Honor series is certainly better than the first(Men in Blue). There is enough action to keep one wanting to read more. In his usual style, Griffin provides his obligatory romantic trysts. Peter Wohl heads up the new Special Operations division and is personally charged with finding a serial rapist who has been terrorizing Philadelphia women. Young Matt Payne is involved in what proves to be an abrupt and very unlikely ending, sending readers on to book 3."
2,DEAD IN ONE MONTH,Bought this one to use while I walk on treadmill. It worked for one month and was dead after that. DO NOT BUY!
1,Terrible,First headset only Right speaker worked. Shipped back to manufacturer. They sent me a brand new headset and i could not pair this one with any device. Just the button would not work. I couldnt even power them down i had to wait untill it would sleep.I currently have this useless headset sitting on my desk and soon to be recycled in the circular file. Waste of money.
5,!My Puggle Loves It!,"My Puggle is a chewer, Anything he can find, it's destroyed. Since purchasing this item his destructive habits have lessened greatly. He's completely addicted to this toy. Takes it with him everywhere. Anyone with a ""power-chewer"" of a dog - GET THIS! It'll last a VERY long time. I hope this is helpful!"
4,3.5 out of 4 Paws,"First Impression: Man it was time for a new Nylabone. Mom and Dad bought me my first two almost 5 months ago! They were looking a little nasty, but I still loved them. The kind folks over at Nylabone sent me a gift box and I got to try out this new monster of a chew bone. Now it is shaped a little weird, but I like it none the less. Every time Mom and Dad eat lunch or dinner I lay down and chew on a Nylabone. It keeps me entertained while they eat that amazing smelling human food... I just close my eyes and pretend.Conclusion: Great chew bone! Lasts a very long time. Not sure what could be improved."
2,No different than any other Nylabone...,"This is really no different than any other Nylabone other than the shape. The bone is still a hard plastic type material that does splinter and form sharp shards that cut the dogs mouth and catch on everything. Not really happy, was hoping for a different material that doesn't do that. So it is over rated and not what I had hoped for."
4,Great bone for dogs who like to chew that never wears away,"This is a great bone for dogs who love to chew as no matter how long, or how hard they try, they will never be able to wear out, or chew away, this bone. My dog enjoyed chewing on his first Galileo bone, although it spent most of the time buried. After it was destroyed by a lawnmower, I bought this one. However, my dog now has no interest in it. Probably because it has no taste, and he knows that his chewing doesn't get him anywhere with it. But for dogs who are getting this bone for the first time, they will be sure to enjoy it until they realize that their chewing is getting them no where. Better than having them chew on everyone's shoes!"
5,pup loves it,it lasts forever and mimics a bone so pup loves it. really loud when you drop it though. I highly recommend
2,Great Chew Toy!,"I usually have only great things to say about most Nylabone chews, however, the shape/style of this one I do not like. It also seems to splinter more quickly than the other products. One bone will typically last my pooch 2-4 weeks, this one I had to throw out after just one week. I will not purchase this product again."
1,Very disappointed in this bone,"I have a large, very aggressive chewer (chocolate lab). I've had pretty good luck with two other nylabone products, but they were a bit small and I figured it was time to bring out the big gun. With all these bones I believe it's time to retire them when small chunks start coming off of them; this bone did not last long before this started happening. By contrast the other nylabones lasted much longer, but based on price and advertised qualities it should have been the other way around.So this was a lot of money for a product that lasted less than a month. The search continues but I'll be looking at products made by other companies a bit harder now. I regret not buying this locally as I would have marched back into the store with this bone."
3,taylor swift dvd,taylor swift dvd.this is difficult one as the item arrive in good cond.& had we been able to play then would probably had rating i liked or loved it but as not able to play & the present for our daughter who was most disappointed then can only mark as i dont like as couldnt play so for this have marked as so.did put i dont like but as have refund will be fair & say its ok although not seen as not able to watch as not for uk market.
4,What Happens in Vegas,"Two people discover they've gotten married following a night of debauchery in Vegas, with one of them winning a jackpot after playing the other's quarter. The pair trys to undermine each other and get their hands on the money... falling in love along the way. What Happens In Vegas is a very good romantic comedy. It is very funny and will have you laughing at pretty much every scene."
3,"Well, if you are going to copy, copy from the best","Hollywood loves copies. it takes some of the risk out of investing in movies, or so the legend goes. This film is another version of Honeymoon in Vegas. I don't mean kind of, or sort of. The male lead is similar, the female lead (Cameron Diaz) is VERY similar to Sarah Jessica Parker. How similar? SJParker is a beautiful actress with great legs AND gym work arms that are better than my own. Cameron Diaz is a beautiful actress with great legs AND gym arms that are better than...well, you get the picture. If they follow similar plots, even similar casting, you know you have a similar film. SO? Well, Honeymoon in Vegas, with James Caan, was very good. It had real plot twists, and real angst about losing a very foxy wife. This film, a derivative, is light and fluffy. It is pleasant enough viewing, but if you must get one film, do not get this but get the original: Homeymoon in Vegas, also in stock on Amazon."
2,I would not call this funny,"Zero chemistry between Cameron Diaz and Ashton Kutcher. The title makes it seem like this will be another Vegas caper flick. Not. Very little actually happens in Vegas here, though what does happen is what passes for the funniest part of this unfunny date movie. The rest is a yawn, at best. Nothing is even remotely believable. Watch if you have nothing better at hand."
1,"Crass, Loud, Rude, Vulgar, Insulting and Just Plain Foolish","In addition to being a complete waste of time, money, effort (or lack thereof) and resources, this film did not deserve to be made. So many struggling actors, directors, writers that are out there that spin yarns more enjoyable in their sleep, and yet, Hollywood green-lights these ridiculous movies that degrade humanity and set us back as a people. We need to reject these movies and begin supporting smaller features with more heart and soul. I don't personally care for the lack of talent possessed by this movie's stars, but even I can admit that they can do much better."
2,You've already seen this movie,"If you've seen any ""romantic comedy"" made between 1998 and the present, you've pretty much seen this movie. All the usual cliches are here: the young irresponsible rakish male who doesn't want to grow up or be tied down, the poor, victimized woman who's been dumped, all the tired obligatory battle-of-the-sexes scenes, and the man of course, at the end, realizing how in the wrong he was and begging for the woman's hand in marriage. Oh, and about 20 iterations of men getting kicked or punched in the genitals."
5,SLR photography,Anyone starting out with an SLR camera can learn quick and easy using this manual. This is not about point-and-shoot cameras.
2,GIANT dress. Tiny arms!,"This is a ONE SIZE dress. I wear an XL in shirts, and the top fit me great, because the blue material is stretchy. The yellow skirt is HUGE and it doesn't lay on the waist as shown in the photo.. it comes up very high.. only a few inches below the bra.. so the full skirt that high up made me look HUGE! The sleeves are puffy, but the red band around the bottom of the sleeves does NOT stretch. It was cutting off the circulation in my arms, and I could barely get the arms through the holes. I ended up cutting them and sewing an elastic band on the inner part (near my armpit) so that my arms fit better. Also, the white collar is very floppy, and doesn't stand up unless you hold it (like the woman in the photo is doing).. however, it's 2 layers, so I was able to cut it open in the back where it velcros together, and I slid in some bendable foam that I got at the craft store.. sewed it up, and it stayed."
5,Love it!,You can't get a better combo of hot muscle and fast cars. Diesel & Johnson were made to do movies together!
1,Bluray disc no sounds,"I was perorder the combo packaging, because i like the firm Fast Five. but the Bluray disc sfter enter playmovie was no sounds. I don't want just because $20 than spen my time to return, but this was made me mad."
3,Like a really expensive Roadrunner cartoon,"When the very first line uttered is internally inconsistent and utter nonsense it gives you a good idea what you're in for. The things people will see this for are well done, physics defying action pieces but there's never any real suspense because the whole thing is completely predictable - like a really expensive Roadrunner cartoon.I heard that Dwayne Johnson put on thirty pounds of muscle for this role. I'm not sure why. The role doesn't require it. My guess is that he wanted to make sure he looked like a credible opponent for his fight with Vin Diesel, but he ended up looking like he could snap Vin in half without trying so the fight lost credibility anyway."
5,Moog Ball Joints,"These ball joints were a perfect fit for my 1997 Jeep Grand Cherokee. Replaced all four ball joints and all of the tie rods, and it handles like new."
2,Did not receive the purchased toner.,The toner that was mailed to me was not the same that I had purchased. I requested a refund or for them to replace with the correct toner that I initially ordered. I got a full refund and must say that the person helping me to expedite the refund was really great. She turned a possible bad experience into one that inspires me to continue shopping through Amazon.
1,Mud,"I like a lot of metal, including some Black Metal, but this is by far one of the worst albums I've ever heard. I'm not talking about the song writing, or the lyrics or vocals or something, I'm talking about the recording itself. This has by far the worst production of any Black Metal album, and that's saying something for a genre that fans expect, nay, demand have low production value. It sounds like Emperor recorded this album in a concrete basement, through a PVC pipe, into a broken microphone, with their equipment covered in mud. Then it sounds like they played the recording back through a blown out speaker at full volume into a telephone and recorded that to the final album. I would like to criticize the actual music on the album ""In the Nightside Eclipse"", but unfortunately it is such a muddled mess all I hear is noise. If you think ultra-low production quality is neat, then by all means enjoy this mess, but if you like to be able to hear the instruments being played, then pass on this."
1,Stay away!,"The first day this arrived it worked very well. The vlume was real low, but all other features worked. Then it just locked up permanently. I loaded the new firmware, tried reformatting, nothing worked. I was really disappointed after this product seemed like a great fit the first few hours. I returned it for a refund the next day."
2,poor battery life,Beware when using thsi unit with 512 mg SD cards; there is NO battery life to speak of. It lasts perhaps 1.5 hours with a 512 catd.
2,worst than the same old same old,"Grafton seems to be more and more filling up her books with Kinsey's mundane day to day routines of life....ie: brushing her teeth, taking a shower, getting dressed, going for her morning 3 mile jog, eating chunky style peanut butter and pickle sandwiches... Anything to fill those pages, eh? Boring. I ended up skipping over alot. The plot is ho hum zzzz. There is but one action scene. The characters are cold and lifeless. The best part was the very beginning with the dog. That's it.I've read all but 2 of the alphabet books and would rate this down in the lower third. Mediocre. In my opinion _G for Gumshoes_ is her best."
1,"The heroine ""Kinsey"" is on such an ego trip !","I dislike Kinsey immensly.She is so immersed in herself.She hates her relatives for what reason I have never figured out.Struggled really hard to finish this book.At page 46 I was so sick of her self indulgence. Yuk ! Get a life, Kinsey"
3,Good - not great,"But even a 'not great"" Kinsey Milhone story is better than most others. I felt the story was rushed - and some things didn't mesh with the time period, e.g., making the comment about liposution (don't think there was too much liposuction going on in the 70's). This book is easy to read and if you're a true Kinsey lover, you won't be too disappointed."
4,Ex-husband cleared of Murder?,"I didn't really care for ""Q"" but due in part to prompting from my wife I read ""O"" and found the story moved much more easily. I like that in a murder mystery. In ""O"" Grafton plops the mystery right in Kinsey's face. Years earlier Kinsey left her husband, at the time, because she suspected he murdered someone. Good reason to leave your spouse, I'd think. Quite by happenstance she receives information that might clear her husband and to digging she begins. You can imagine that whoever the real murderer is, her ex or someone else, will do what they can to stop her. She knows this, of course, but wants to put an end to the mystery once and for all.This is a fast paced and entertaining novel, another for you to dive into when getting lost in an imaginary world is what's needed.Marvin Wiebener, author of THE MARGIN and soon to be released THE MORIAH RUSE.The MarginThe Moriah Ruse"
3,Seems a bit perfunctory; lacks complexity,"I agree that the murderer was evident almost from when the character was introduced. I also thought that the end was rushed. And Henry and Rosie seemed to appear only for those of us who like them and expect to see them in each book. Their appearances were non-integral to the plot. And indeed, where was William? I have re-read ""A"" - ""M"" at least twice and listened to many of them on tape as well. ""O"" seems perfunctory and simplistic."
5,Attn readers,We have gone back to the begining of this series and are reading all of them. Sue Grafton is our FAVORITE mystery writer. Every book is excellent and you won't be sorry getting them.
5,O is for Outlaw,As usual Ms Grafton has breathed life into Kinsey Millhone and brought forth another memorable entry into her alphabet mysteries. O if for OUTSTANDING!
5,The best one in a while. I loved it!,"Great story. Enjoyed reading it. Couldn't put it down. Started it yesterday and finished it this morning. Highly recommend. I think ""I is for Innocent"" was the last one I really liked. The ones since have left me unsatisfied. Finally I can say again, ""That was great."""
3,Not My Favorite Book of Grafton's,"I found this book a little confusing.Basically, it is about a long unsolved murder until Kinsey's ex-husband Mickey is shot and lands in the hospital critically ill.Someone sells Kinsey some old info of Mickey's that he left behind, and it is from there that Kinsey tries to connect that facts of what really happened to Mickey and who attempted his murder. Was it Dixie, his old lover? Or Could it have been Mark, supposedly an old chum? Some other detectives think Kinsey entered into it somehow, and Kinsey puts them straight, but almost to the expense of her own life."
2,Entertaining and fast reading. Not among her best.,"I look forward to Grafton's new ones; however, I think Kinsey's slovenly dress and unhealthy diet was really overdone in this novel. Maybe I am just getting tired of it. I love Spenser's gourmet ways but, of course, that is Parker's style. I also felt that Henry did not interact with Kinsey nearly as much as in the past and Kinsey did not treat him nearly as well. I missed him."
2,Disappointed,"I am an avid reader of Sue Grafton's books...and always look forward to the next one. BUT, I have to say this one was a disappointment. Too many superfluous descriptions of places and things seemingly unrelated...just to add words? It was definitely not up to her usual standards..I hope this doesn't mean ""O"" is for burned Out!"
5,O is Outstanding - Intrigue at its best,"What ever happened to Kinsey's first husband? Here, you'll find out. Kinsey's curiosity gets the best of her in this twisted nystery of the highest quality. So many clues and so many red herrings make this a book in which I wish I had taken notes along the way. Some of the ""good guys"" turn out bad, and some of the ""bad guys"" turn out good. For the second time, Sue Grafton takes us back to Louisville, as Kinsey attempts to discover why so many people have Kentucky and Vietnam in common. Another common thread is the old gang at that favorite watering hole in Colgate. Like all of the best alphabet stories, this one ends with a bang, in which Kinsey must deal with imminent death as she uncovers the killer. When you discover the motivation behind the killer, you will be satisfied. By all means, read this winner!"
4,Kinsey is back!,"I have traveled the alphabet with Sue Grafton and this book helps me to understand the main character in the series all the more. This book is one of her best. I loved learning more about Mickey. However, this is the only Sue Grafton book that forced me to find the box of kleenex in order to get through the last pages."
4,great accompaniment for aspiring singers......,"I am going to take a detour from my usual subject matter on Amazon (hit CDs, movies, great snacks and books).The one passion I have besides my writing is singing. I was looking for a great karaoke album with the hits of Alicia Keys and I found it! SONGS IN THE STYLE OF ALICIA KEYS is a great set of instrumental versions of the songs that Ms. Keys is known best for. They include ""Fallin,'"" ""How Come You Don't Call Me,"" and ""If I Ain't Got You."" The only downside is this purely instrumental and there are no vocal examples to help guide you so you can maintain your pitch. I guess that's what Alicia's albums are for!"
5,Protection When You Ride,Great trinket for riders. The medal can be used as a keychain or attached to bike for that added safety and protection that Catholics have come to depend on with St. Christopher. Gave as a Christmas gift and the recipient loved it. Very unique and original concept. This product offers a great alternative rather than wearing St. Christopher medal on a chain/as a necklace. I highly recommend. You will not be disappointed.
2,Good Writing Is the Best Revenge,"If the tacky title doesn't put you off this British thriller, the absence of any real thrills certainly will. In spite of ""Hamlet"" and other narratives you might name, revenge is never a noble motive. Yet this movie invites us to root for Clive Owen to take down the villain ""responsible"" for the suicide of his young drug-dealing brother (who is truly to blame is subject to conjecture). The pretentious script takes forever coming to a conclusion.The real mystery here is why such dependable actors, Clive Owen and the utterly wasted Charlotte Rampling among them, signed on to such a cold-blooded exercise. The movie looks good, perhaps because we spend more time looking at the screen than concentrating on what is happening. To help in this respect, you will want to click on the English subtitles; everyone in it is as soft-spoken as the movie itself is hard-hearted."
2,Did I miss something?,"Watching Clive Owen in Croupier and Arthur, I looked forward to viewing this movie even though I knew it was a bad sign that I had not heard of it. Ebert's and Roeper's ""two thumbs way up"" also sold me on renting it, but I wonder if we saw the same film. Boy, what an incomplete storyline!At the conclusion, I immediately went to see if there was a director's commentary to discuss what happened. My main complaint is the lack of explanation why Boad (Malcolm McDowell) committed such a heinous act. The reveal never came, nor did the desired backstory delving into what drove Will into isolation.On the plus side, I enjoyed the British dialogue and the setting. We are indeed two nations separated by a common language. This however is not enough to recommend this film.Here's hoping that Clive Owen will finally get a role that lets him use more of his facial muscles and a script that doesn't need an accompanying Cliff Notes to understand the plot."
2,Snoozer,"Kept hoping/waiting for something to actually happen in this movie, and really, never did. If you feel like wasting some time on a boring movie, with really zero payoff at the end, this is the movie for you."
2,Cords useless but rubber salvageable,I bought the larger of this one for my 12-week old mixed-breed-retriever. The cloth came apart at the seems within 5 minutes and had to be removed for safety. He did enjoy the rubber texture so I threaded & knotted a rope to it and made it into a chase/chew toy. Would last longer if they used braided cotton instead of sewn canvas. Overall not worth the price.
4,I am a fan,"I am a Tamora Pierce Fan though the immortal series isn't my favorite it does fit in nicely after the Alanna quartet, and the main characters show up in later quartets, so when you get to the protector of the Small quartet you have all of that back story."
4,Pretty good.,"I love the show and the music of Elvis Costello. However, they really don't mix it up too much. The performances are top notch, but all the songs are very slow paced and many dwell on the same themes and can get depressing and monotonous. Not surprising considering her guest, but it's just one of those that was probably better as just a broadcast. You probably won't listen to it over and over."
4,Keeps elbow very warm but slightly constrictive,The neoprene does a great job of keeping the elbow warm and does a nice job of compression as well. The velcro strap takes some getting used to. If you are bending your arm a great deal it can greatly constrict mobility and cut circulation to your forearm if too tight but it will do nothing when your arm is straight if it is too loose.
5,Hilarious!,Friends checked this book out at the library. After reading 3 pages I knew we needed our own copy and I ordered it that day. We all love it. I hear quite a few dad's I know when I read it :)
2,Not what I was hoping for,"I thought this would have short, cute fairy tales... instead I found ""humorously"" edited versions to abbreviate well-known fairy tales. Not really what I had in mind to read to the kids in the family. They didn't quite understand the humor."
5,"fine product, late arrival","the product was what I expected: a basic sword cleaning kit. Price was superb. However, it came late after being accidentally shipped to NJ."
1,Sent it back,"The oil bottle arrived empty, the pegs were missing, and there were no instructions. Sent it back. If anyone can suggest a substitute kit, please post it."
1,Oil spill,When I opened my kit for the first time the sword oil container was open and the oil had spilled all over everything inside. Company should make a better oil container. Not going to return such a low price product. Shipping would be more trouble than it's worth.
4,satisfactory,"satisfactory, and i like the fact that it arrived in the mail on time, it was all that the add said that it would be."
2,Historic Tango Recordings filtered to mush.,"These are wonderful historical early recordings of Tango music, acoustically recorded. But the engineers have filtered the sound to death. What a shame. There is much more vitality to be had in these 1920 recordings than has been allowed through in this transcription. If anyone else knows of better engineering of early Tango recordings, please make a pointer."
3,Emperor's low point,"Emperor's low point is still far better than most other metal pretenders. This band owned black metal. Yet it's hard for me to think of IX Equilibrium as more than a stepping stone, a transitional period, between the landmark Anthems and the ultra-progressive Prometheus. The guitar tone is very, very brittle. I really dig the operatic vocals, and the lyrics are as well-done as we've come to expect from Ihsahn. While being quite a good album on its own, this record does pale in comparison to both the one which preceded it and the one which follows it. Nonetheless, its good outweighs its bad, and it is worth your listening time."
5,Hail the mighty Emperor!,"This was my first Emperor cd, but it won't be my last! It is very heavy, very brutal, and very symphonic/melodic at the same time. Ihsahn's black cvocals are scary as hell, but I still think the only black metal vocalist who should be aloud to do the clean voice is Vortex (Dimmu Borgir, ex-Borknagar)My copy had three bonus tracks: a short instrumental, a remix of Curse you All Men, and a very industrial sounding track i didn't recognize. I'd recommend this album to fans of all types of black metal, as well as to fans who listen to vicious death metal. It was a wonderful listen."
1,Emperor is going in the wrong direction!,"Everyone hyped this album to be better than anthems and nightside. obviously, they were wrong! this is emperor's worst cd! the little girly king diamondish vocals were enough for me! the music wasn't as well orchestrated as anthems or nightside. boring riffs, stupid lyrics, and like i said, the girly vocals from ihsahn. trym's blast beats were pretty good. not as good as his previous works with emperor and enslaved. i was truly dissapointed. bad selection to pick up."
4,Brutal!!!,"While there is very little variation in tempo throughout this album, the intensity never wanes. I actually prefer the operatic flourishes of ""Anthems to the Welkin at Dusk"" and ""Prometheus: the Discipline of Fire and Demise"" to the death metal leanings of this CD. But, that being a matter of personal taste, I will not diminish my praise for ""IX Equilibrium."" As a whole, this is a very strong album; it's just not as memorable. However, I have the distinct feeling that upon repeat listens I will find this to be just as intricate."
1,patheric!,this item is my worst purchase on Amamzon - 4 months and all the screws are falling off. The glider makes so much noise that i cannot have my baby aleep in my arms. overall a really bad buy -
4,Good but noisy,the chair is good looking and comfortable. The problem is it makes a little noise from the first time.Easy assembly also (everything included)
5,Thank you,"Quick delivery, quick and easy set up (put it together by myself while also keeping an eye on my 2 toddlers), looks great and feels wonderful!! I'm very pleased."
3,"The price is right, but there are flaws","This glider was a great price, but I wish I had splurged on a nicer glider. In fact, I wish I had test-driven a few gliders before making a decision. I've spent endless nights in this glider, only to discover that my sister-in-law has a much comfier glider. Yes, she paid more, but well worth it.This glider looked great initially, but now, after three months of use, it has shifting cushions and the fabric looks worn and dirty. It's also squeaky. Some babies enjoy this; my baby does not.Dang."
4,Great for the price,"I bought this last year when I was pregnant. I have had it over a year now and it is still in great shape. It is not the most cushy chair out there ( I had to add a thin pillow) but for the price it is very much worth it. My husband who is 6' 2"" and 275lbs sits in it all the time and we have had not problems with it!"
4,Chair,Heaven in a chair. I love this chair for middle of the night feedings. This chair is far superior to any rocking chair I've ever sat in.
5,Great for Nursery,"I like this glider and ottoman, it was easy for my hubby to put together and came when it was supposed to. I think baby and I will enjoy it."
5,Liked It so much we're buying one for my sister in law:),"This product has done it's job for us, it's a great deal!Many of the reviewers complaining about it breaking must be heavier people and it may not handle that.Like anything you will hear bad stuff, but think of the factors that could contribute to it."
2,"Squeaks (a lot) after a while, not built to last","I totally agree with the review ""Invest in the best...this is NOT it!"". The EXACT same thing happened to us. Every single word she said was true. My advice is to spend a bit more for a better chair."
2,"terrible packaging, chair arrived broken","terrible packaging, chair arrived broken, had to return it, was a waste of time and energy."
5,Great Chair,"Easy assembly and a great price!Very comfortable, well made, nice fabric.Would recommend this chair as a must buy."
4,great chair,The construction of the chair was simple. It took about ten minutes. The only downside to the chair I found was that the padding was a tad thin.
3,"good, but missing essentials","This product was super easy to put together...until I got to the side cushions. They are supposed to snap to the chair. One side I had no issues...the other side is missing one whole snap and the the other one is bent (in other words cannot be used). I'm really depressed that this product came damaged, and I will have to figure out someway to fix it."
1,Not Comfortable,"The chair looked great, but when I sat in it it didn't allow me to recline enough as needed when rocking a baby. I was really disappointed because it looked so nice."
4,Looks great,"So far I am really happy with this product- however our little one is not here yet so we haven't used it much at all. The chair was easy to assemble, and looks beautiful in the nursery. Also, very comfortable to sit in. I don't think you can do much better for the price. If it lasts me two years I will be very happy."
4,Nice looking...,"I bought this glider and ottoman to match the furniture for my babies nursery. It looks great and was very easy to put together. The only problem I have is the seat cushion is not very comfortable. The cushion on the back of the glider is very comfortable and I am hoping with use that the seat cushion will soften up a bit. Other than that, I love it."
3,smaller than I thought,"I picked this glider out for my in-laws to buy as a gift. It is comfortable, but it is much smaller than I thought. I don't consider myself a big person but I am about 5'8"" and my husband is 6'8"" and the seat doesn't come to the back of my knees and the back doesn't come up very high (about the bottom of my neck). I guess I thought the back would be much bigger and higher from the looks of the picture and is not comfortable for him at all. It's not too bad for me, but I feel like I'm sitting in a large child's seat. Anyone else feel this way?"
2,Arms broke off!,This Glide was easy to assemble and was great until one day I was rocking my baby and the I felt a jolt. The front of the arm rests had come apart and one broke completely off. I was so scared when it happened that me and my baby were going to crash to the floor. It hadn't even been a year since purchasing the chair and it broke. The only good thing I can say is that Stork Craft are replacing the arms for free without a problem. But if the one year warranty had expired who knows the hassle it might have been.
2,hasnt even been shipped yet!,I placed this order 15 days ago and it STILL has not even been shipped! I have searched to contact the company to ask why but have had no luck with finding contact info. leaving a low feedback is the only way that i know how to get in touch with them. I will update my feedback when/if I ever recieve my chair and ottoman.
3,Comfy exept for the seat cushion,"I bought this chair since I am pregnant and I was having trouble with my back sitting on the sofa. It is very comfy and helps with the back however the seat cushion is too thin and sitting on it for long times make your bump heart, so you might need extra cushioning.On the positive note It looks good, doesn't need too much space, and it is easy to assemble."
3,Rocker Glider,I expected something with a richer apperance to the chair but found after receiving the price of $132.00 was in line. As you know I returned the chair as within the third day squeeks and knocks began to happen. I juess I expected more.
4,"Overall, good product!",Chair didn't take long to assemble and wasn't complicated at all. The tools you need come with it. I've gotten so many comments on how beautiful the color is. Only complaint I have isThat the bottom cushion isn't the softest. My butt tends to go to sleep after sitting for a while. Nothing a small pillow can't fix!!
4,Good buy for the price,"I received this glider as a shower gift from friends and I have no complaints about it. We've had it about two months now and it's great! It matches the other baby furniture perfectly and works very well for our small house with very small rooms. The ottoman has started to get a little side to side wiggle, but I'm sure that will stop once we retighten some screws. I use the chair everyday and night for nursing and with a small pillow added for additional lumbar support, I frequently fall asleep in it. Compared to other more expensive models this one is just fine. I sat in a lot of gliders trying to decide on which one I liked and there were of course some pricier models that were more comfortable, but also some that were a lot less comfortable. The fabric is nice and very easy to clean (so far all stains have come out with only a damp rag). if you are a budget conscience person then this glider is perfect for you!"
2,Uncomfortable and Squeaks,"The look and design of this chair is great. However, after having the chair in use prior to our baby's arrival the wood started creaking and squeaking. This is the ultimate reason why we returned the chair. The chair is a tight squeeze for Dad at 6'1'' 220 lbs, but fits Mom nicely 5'2'' ~125 lbs. The seat cushion is very thin and firm and can cause numbness in the rear and legs."
3,"good, but squeaks","For a cheaper chair, the quality of the wood is good. The first one we received had a broken base and had to be returned. The second chair was in good condition without any scratches or broken pieces. The color was true to the picture and the chairs' padding was softer than I had expected. That's especially good after just having a baby. However, the biggest complaint is the squeak it developed in just a week of use. My husband used 3 in 1 oil to quite the squeak and it remained silent for two days, but came back just as bad as the first time. We expected a squeak from such a cheap chair, that's why the review isn't any worse. My husband is working on a permanent fix for the squeak, but as of yet, the oil/wd40 is what we're using."
4,Good rocker!,"Very nice chair! A little weak for me (270 lb. male) but perfect for my daughter, who just had a baby boy! She loves it!!!"
1,Unable to assemble,Just tried to put it together and we were unable to assemble the back of the chair to the base. All parts were included per the directions however there is no physical way to fasten the back of the chair to the base without adding parts from the hardware store. The bolt can slide in and out because the holes are too big.
3,Good product,This took about ten minutes to put together and looks good. Works fine and will suit our purpose for it. I would recommend this product.** Update. As of a few months ago the frame has broken and unable to be fixed. It still is a decent product but not very sturdy.
2,"Terrible build, but comfortable","Ordered this chair for my soon-to-arrive first son and put it together today. Much to my dismay, the first step in the instructions did not go to plan! The backrest is to be screwed into the base of the chair, but the sleeve anchors were not installed in the pre-drilled holes, so they wouldn't bite to anything. The fix requires (2) 2"" bolts with nuts, not elegant, but the only thing I can figure will work. I moved forward with attaching the arms to the back and screwing those into the base, but that required significant tweaking as the armrests were poorly assembled and did not line up with the holes. After that, it all came together fine and is comfortable, but the poor quality build is extremely disappointing."
4,Nice at first.,"The chair was beautiful at first. It seemed very comfortable for the first few times I used it. After a while the cushions seemed thin and the fabric was not so easy to clean as I had hoped. A few milk spills and spit ups during feedings and the cushion was stained. Almost immediately the ties on the back cushion started to rip and now are completely ripped off of the cushion. Still has a nice, smooth gliding action and the chair itself seems to be pretty well made."
3,New owner,"I haven't had this glider too long (in fact, I just assembled it today), but I wasn't too impressed by the sturdiness of it. I'm hoping that it can hold up to the test of time. I was also a bit put off as the arms didn't line up too well with the base bolt holes and the back bolt holes at the same time (noticeable when installing second arm). More than once while tightening bolts I would suddenly hear wood fracture when I wasn't even muscling down on it.It looks nice, though, and is very comfortable. The wife loves it."
2,crusin the world,I did'nt really like this game. Boring! You can use your steering wheel but the peddles did not work on this game!
2,OK,The frame rate is not so good and the resolution is horrible. If you want a 5 star racing game try Beetle Adventure Racing.
3,A Classic.,"Slim is a legend. The price of this cd makes it impossible to pass up. If your a country fan, drop a few dollars on a classic performer who has been a part of the roots of contemperary country."
4,Would be best if Canola Oil was left out,"Great ingredients although, chicken should have been 1st rather than chicken broth, the only thing I do not think belongs in it is Canola oil. Canola or rapeseed is not someting a dog would ever find in nature and if it did find rapeseed in nature and eat it, it would poison them. Today's Food industries have convinced the masses that Canola oil is a safe and even better oil than olive or virgin coconut, facts though say otherwise. Until the late 70's it was poisonous until they figured out a way to fix that. I still like it but it could be better."
4,Not the Tastiest,"I don't think any dog will love the taste, but this food seems to maintain good health and solid, consistent stool in my senior dog. To make it more palatable, I garnish it with salmon fish oil made for pets, boiled eggs and other treats."
5,"Many excellent meals, easily prepared","Although we own a couple dozen cookbooks, we bought this one recently and have been amazed at how great the dishes are, and at how easy they are to prepare. There is a picture of each dish, plus three or four pictures of key steps in preparation. So far we have made eight recipes from it, six of which we have added to our ""regulars.""Some of the meals will take more than 30 minutes to prepare (especially the first time), but our longest was still under an hour."
5,Best. Cookbook. Ever.,"Love this. Almost every recipe is delicious (I'm not crazy about fish, so I can't judge those). All are very quick. I give this book to everyone I know."
4,"Glory in Death, Book, JD Robb","I am completely satisfied. I would say at least four stars for the dealer. It took a little while to get it, but I was really not in a hurry."
5,One of Eve & Roarke's best scenes inside!,"As far as mysteries go, the killer in this book can be easily figured out so there's not much suspense there. But for those in love with Eve and Roarke, this is an important part of their relationship.This book contains my favourite scene in the whole series when Eve finally admits with great reluctance that she loves Roarke. That section is beautifully written, and J.D. Robb does not compromise their strong willed characters when she writes that part.It's much easier to write how protaganists fall in each other's arms and let down all barriers to declare their love. What is more difficult is when they admit their love and their characterizations remain true even when they are in the most vulnerable of circumstances. So make sure you read Glory in Love, don't give it a miss just because the suspense element is not there."
1,Feminism???,"What on earth is wrong with Eve? In the real world a man like Roarke (who is allegedly smart) would have dumped Eve a long time ago. The woman is cold and even though the writer tries to make us think Eve is actually a warm person deep deep deep inside I am not buying. I have one more question, is this a romance or a mystery book? Either way it fails. Romance is just not there and as far as the mystery goes I knew who the killer was after ten pages or so. Kill the death series!!"
5,Another Winner,"The second book in J.D. Robb's ""...IN DEATH"" series, followingNaked in Death (In Death), is another winner. The thing I love the most about this series, besides the awesome, fully-developed characters, is the fact that the mystery is ALWAYS thrilling and realistic.This time around, popular, well-known, outspoken women are being murdered - their throats viciously slashed. As Eve works to discover the true killer, she also finds family secrets, devious reporters, and new friends in strange places.GLORY IN DEATH features the first appearance of Peabody, a larger role for Nadine Furst, and the first glimpse into what Eve's childhood really entailed.I'm absolutely LOVING rediscovering my favorite romantic suspense series of all time!!"
3,easy to read,many typo error. where is the study guide? answers to excerise are far few and in between.
4,Cutting up good time,Many great projects to get your creative juices going. Photography wasexcellant; was able to enjoy beauty of pieces but not too artsy to interfer with point of the book. I've now found a new textile art to add to my passion.
2,Not what I expected,The decor used in this book looks like the 70's era. It's too outdated for me. I was expecting more.
4,starfox 64,Thank you for getting this game to us in a timely manner as my son was eagerly awaiting to play it !
5,Just get it...,"When they say 1 hour, they mean 1 hour. Plugged it in and charged the included batteries for the first time. All were fully charged within an hour. Batteries get a little warm while charging, but it doesn't appear to hamper their life as their still going on the first charge - 100+ pictures later. I love the fact that you can charge 1 to 4 batteries - not 2 or 4 like the other brands. Stop shopping now and just get this thing!"
5,"Sturdy enough, fit tall, thin 6 year old girl.","These pads are good quality, not too flimsy, but also not overbuilt for kids. They fit a 6 year old girl who's about the size of an average 8 year old on the slender side for her Heely fun."
4,Enjoyable,"Although I am not a big fan of historical romances, I really liked this book and the characters. The characters were memorable."
3,Loved the main character,"I enjoyed the main character, although she was a bit grating at times.Slight spoiler: I didn't like how things ended with Craven. He was by far the most interesting character. I'm hoping the other books give him a 'happily ever after'."
1,Couldn't get past all the typos and mistakes,"This book has some good information, although I agree with an earlier post that the author seems to have the attitude that anyone who doesn't survive long there must not have aloha in their heart.My biggest issue with the book, however, is the typos, misspellings, punctuation errors, and layout inconsistencies (i.e., random spacing between paragraphs, sentences, etc.) that are rampant throughout the book and distracted me to the point that I couldn't even read it. If you expect me to pay $12.95 for a book, please get an editor."
4,When the moon hits your eye,"Depending on your age when you first heard that line, the theatre of your mind may color this famous line from one of Dean Martin's greatest songs. Just to hear the way the orchestra swells as he croons these tunes brings back pleasant memories. Growing up in suburban Chicago - who wouldn't want to be Italian, and who wasn't, hearing those great songs of yesteryear. Songs with lyrics you could understand the first time you heard them, and with a melody that made you want to take your girlfriend in your arms and swirl around the dance floor. Where can you find that today?"
4,Seems to be working,"I bought this for my nine year old Pom., who I think might have alopecia. I've been giving here a dose for about two weeks and I'm starting to notice some fur coming back in on her hid quarters, but can't be sure if its this or fish oil and missing link I've been mixing in her food."
2,Yuk,"This melatonin works, but the taste is one of the worst that I've had. They should have put more cinammon in it or something. It really needs a better flavor, but it works."
5,Great stuff!,"This is great stuff, and even with shipping it still costs only about 2/3 what my local store charges. As a side note, if you're wondering about the difference between this 8oz bottle of 2.5mg Melatonin versus the 2oz bottles of 1mg Melatonin, it works out to exactly the same thing. The small bottles come with a dropper for dosing, and one dropper = 1 ml. The small bottles call for a four-dropper dosage, which = 1mg. Five droppers = one teaspoon. Doing the math, one discovers that 10 droppers = 2 tsp, and also 2.5mg, the dose listed on this big bottle. So if you have a small bottle with a dropper, you can dose exactly the same as usual by using that dropper."
3,"not for toddlers, but works","Got this for my 4 year old with autism spectrum disorder and sleeplessness. Tastes absolutely disgusting and has a high alcohol content. You are better off with chewable tablets and dissolving them in a bit of grape juice with a small medicine cup. DON'T mix any meds with regular food or the child will associate bad things with that food forever.Beyond that it totally works. I find 1.5 mg works best for my 4 year old and myself included. We both wake up wide eyed and bushy tailed each morning from a perfect nights sleep. 2.5 mg or 3 mg is too much. Start small at 1 mg and work your way up to figure out what works best. Overdosing seems to either make you super sleepy all day or wears off in just a few days.I may try the lemon flavored version, but the chewable tablets crush easily and dissolve fast in just a teeny bit of juice for a quick swallow that kids don't mind.Would not buy the Natrol again. Works the exact same as the chewable."
5,Best sleep aid - Melatonin,This product really works. My son was having sleeping problems and his doctor recommended it to him. The instructions state to take medication at least 20 minutes before bedtime. You start to feel sleepy as soon as you take it. I would definitely recommend it to anyone.
2,Nowhere New Now. Lanegan spoke to early '90's me.,"I've evolved in my wait for the new Lanegan effort. I had hoped that he had too. It seems he's relying on his competent collection of musician friends and hasn't done anything to move me now. I liked his earlier stuff, I think it holds up OK. I'm pretty bored with everything now so maybe it's me...I don't think so. Some bands evolve and grow, he needs to."
3,3 stars instead of 4 because xmen should be better,"I wish they had put the ending from the actual movie in the book, I would have liked to read that, but what can you expect when the movie novalization comes out 2 months before the movie? I guess they didn't want to spoil it. But good overall."
4,A comment on the movie vs. book ending discrepancy,"Well, I saw the movie and have acquired the book, but haven't read the book yet.However, I know the ending is different, and wanted to help explain why, based on an interview with Chris Claremont I read on a comic book message board.Simply, Chris had to write and complete the book before the movie was finished - far enough ahead that it didn't allow for any late changes in the script. I think Chris would've preferred that they match as well, but due to production lead times and such, his book had to be wrapped up a lot earlier than the film was.Just don't want Mr. Claremont unfairly picked on for things out of his control."
3,Different climax from the movie!!,"I rather enjoyed this book, right up until the end of the major conflict. The movie must have been changed after the book was published, because the resolution of the main conflict is drastically different between the two."
2,For Small Dogs Only,We were very disapointed at how small this toy is! We have an 82 pound labrador & he could put the whole toy in his mouth.From the picture in the ad it looked like a large toy.
5,A compiliations of rock songs.,"Look carefully at the band names listed either above or on the back of the CD case (if you're in the store). Most of those names on it are from the same time period and Genre. Half the songs have already been released before the album was thought up of. If you can't tell, those names are ROCK names (with a touch of country). Aerosmith has a broad but distinct style. If you don't like it, then I don't recommend it for you. But if you DO like their style, then by all means, get this album. The other names on this album, style-wise, are relatives of Aerosmith. It should be pretty obvious whether or not you'll like this album before you buy it."
3,The goods on the cd,"The music that was contributed by Aerosmith really sold this album. ""I don't Wanna Miss a Thing"" is a good love rock ballad. ""What Kind Of Love Are You On?"" rocks like most any other Aerosmith song. My third favorite is ""Starseed"" by Our Lady Peace. It was remixed really well. Leaving on a Jet Plain is catchy too. Other than those songs, the soundtrack really isn't one of my favorite cds. However there are enough highlights on there for me to recommend it."
3,Good Enough,"I really liked some of the songs on the CD ( i don't want to miss a thing, remeber me, mister bigtime, starseed, orignal score) but for the most part, hte songs really didn't go with the movie, and consisted of too many songs i didn't want to hear. but overall, it was good enough."
2,This soundtrack has little to do with the movie,"After seeing the movie, I was not only impressed by its story and special effects, but also by its fantastic music. With 'its' music I mean the specially written musicscore, not the popsongs. With this in mind I bought the soundtrack. What a mistake! It's nothing more than a average CD with some nice songs on it. The music I was after, was only represented by a 3 minutes track! So, if you like nice songs, buy this CD. But if you're after the fantastic movie-music, DON'T! (P.S. Can anybody tell me how or where I can get the original music-score?)"
2,miss this,The soundtrack to ''Armageddon''was dull and pointless. The songs had nothing to do with the film.
2,"doesn't mildew, but significant mold underneath","My husband takes a bath every night and his bath mats would get pink with mildew, even though we live in Las Vegas which is a very dry environment. I bought this mat for him and it appeared to work great, no mildew on the top. Unfortunately, when I picked up the mat to wash the tub, the underside of the mat was covered in black and green mold that I wasn't able to wash off, even in the washing machine. No, I would not buy this product again. I hate to hurt the environment, but I'll just buy cheap ones and throw them away regularly."
4,Good for Young Readers,"U.S. journalist-author William L. Shirer was a newsman in Nazi Germany for six years (1934-40) who later wrote superb books on the subject. Here he aims for a young audience, outlining the rise and fall of one of history's worst villians. Young readers see how Hitler rose from nothing, the brutal war he launched, and the incredible cruelty and mass killings that marked his reign. There's even a look at his last days in the bunker, screeching paranoia about being betrayed as the Russians closed in. The book is readable and well-crafted, but never quite captures Nazism as did his superb adult efforts - BERLIN DIARY, RISE AND FALL OF THIRD REICH, NIGHTMARE YEARS. Still this is a good pick for young readers with an interest in history."
3,Ello is more fun with other figure sets,"I gave 3 stars for the fun-factor because the dolls you make fall apart if played with... not very fun at all.The ello building sets that you use to make the structures are fun though!Personally my daughter and I think ello is more fun when you use it to make houses for little dolls and my little pony.Its perfect for the plastic miniature sets like hamtaro, that come with little figures and furniture, but no house.You might want to look for something like that to use in your ello instead."
5,A Third Masterpiece from Mariachi Cobre: The Featured Band at EPCOT!,"This fantasic Mariachi Band has been playing at Walt Disney World's EPCOT for 30 years (this October) and they are really, really, really good! Prior to EPCOT opening in October of 1982, they played numerous other gigs at The Magic Kingdom!If you are a fan of good Mariachi Music, you need these three albums, and if you just want to add some great CDs to your music collection, with some International Flavor...you still need these CDs!All three albums are very well made, and the music selection is superb! You will not be disappointed!"
4,Oasis Standard Holdguard Review,"The Oasis Standard Holdguard is the only water bottle holder on the market that protects the tip end of the water bottle when the bottle is suspended in the cage with the animals. This is especially true when using a water bottle with rodents such as rats and mice. With any other water bottle holder, the plastic water bottle around the tip end is exposed to the gnawing teeth of the small animals as they drink. Just one chew with the tiniest of a hole is all it takes to ruin the water bottle and wet the cage bedding."
5,Must see artists,Julie is an inspiration for all artists! The book shows some of her best work. It also reveals a little of what goes on in that beautiful head of her's. Outstanding artist and human! Love the woman and her art!
1,I-Rocks Merchandise is junk,"If you want this mouse for the appearance...fine. If you want a functional mouse....move on. I-Rocks merchandise, as far as functionality, usability and stability are concerned...its junk. Go find a real mouse to buy."
2,"Looks nice, works well....for a while","Don't buy this mouse expecting to use it for any significant length of time. It looks great and would be a great collectible item for a Superman fan, but it does stop working right after a short time (as another review said, about a year). Around that time, buttons started to do things they weren't supposed to do, then they quit working altogether. Some of the blue paint started to wear away after a year of use as well. I still have it, but it's just a collectible now, stuck in a box. So buy this for the novelty of it, just expect to replace it soon."
3,"An amazing work of literature, but work for the reader too.","I saw a mention of JR as one of the great American novels on Facebook earlier this summer and decided to take the challenge. And what a challenge it is; the mechanism of a nearly all-dialogue and minimal use of punctuation can make it a chore to read, but there are rewards. There are rich descriptions of an educational system gone awry, 1970's New York, and a time when divorces were changing the landscape of American families. I tend to read very quickly and you simply cannot with this book. Take the time and if the mechanisms do not drive you crazy, you will be rewarded - BUT this book is not for everyone, so if it doesn't grab you in the first 50 pages or so, let it go."
5,Gospel Supergroup,"The Covenant Brothers were gospel notables Bishop Carlton Pearson, Ben Tankard, Beau Williams, Lonnie Brown and Dr. Leonard Scott, who combined their gifts in this set from 1998."
2,Good information badly written,"This book summarizes some important distributed systems patterns researchers have identified in recent years. In that sense it is a necessary contribution to the software engineering literature.However, the examples are at times unclear and the author does not always motivate them convincingly. From a technical writing perspective, the passive voice plagues this book from start to end, forcing readers to stop and reread sections to make sense of convoluted prose."
3,Verbose and Specific,"It's a great topic for a book - concurrent network programming.Although the documented patterns suit server and client applications, I would have prefered to see them treated in a more general context. I would also prefer to see the patterns explained in far fewer pages. Each pattern is usually described with a heavy emphasis on a very specific example (like an HTTP server) rather than in conceptual terms."
5,"Informative, in-depth search into the roles of special forced in today's military","This book, The Commandos, was a very good read right up until the end. I enjoyed the in-depth study of the role of all the branches of the Special Forces. This book tells the story with the respect deserved by the men that risk their lives every day for this great nation. Thank you, Mr. Waller for your effort to put the heroic deeds of these brave men and into print for us to read.Michael"
2,Too much emphasis on training,"I was looking for a good read on the exploits and battles of commando units - and this book was a disappointment. Out of 430 pages, 260 deal with training - and the remaining pages deal with listening posts setup during desert-storm. Those items will probably hold interest for many readers, but if you're looking for a firefight - this is not the book for you."
2,interesting to see how cookbooks has evolved over the years,"This is a cookbook for those who really understand Chinese cooking and have the resources to translate some of the terms and recipes. It is mainly in Cantonese/English which is a southern Chinese dialect and in today's reading material it's mostly translate in Mandarin Chinese. However, it is really fun to read how cookbooks was written and how it has changed in the last 30 some years. It was more entertianing than useful as a cookbook, but don't look for any touched-up pictures or fancy stories."
4,Good product,What can you say about a multi vitamin. I'm still alive and it didn't make me feel any worse.
2,Daily one caps---,"What can I say about this product? It makes me sick to my stomach. Every time I would take it, with a meal I would feel sick to my stomach. Not like unbearable nausea but definately made being at work a bother. A lot of the capsules had broken in the container as well. I would not recommend this product. I have taken similar daily multi vitamins and had a great feeling during the day with no negative side effects. Take at your own risk."
3,"""Sex and the City"" go searching the perfect bath","Did someone give the author an idea that in order to sell a non-fiction today, it has to have a Sex and the City flavor? Otherwise how can one explain this constant accidental meetings between good-looking exotic males and the writer, who is a single, thirty-ish, female New Yorker. From my view, this book could stand by itself without this boy meets girl side-story. At times it was very distracting to otherwise an excellent travelogue. I regret this because the central theme of the quest for the perfect bath is an honest effort with not too much cliche or stereotypes."
5,great product,if u are putting in an aftermarket stereo in a first or 2nd generation durango (or other dodge) u will need this. snaps right on no problems. Delivered in 2 days. very happy.
2,This is NOT a new APC battery!!!,"The accompanying graphic indicates that this is an APC battery, but this is not true. The text says that it is an American Battery Company batter and this is correct.This is a not a new battery but a refurnished one as indicated by the many, many scratches on the bottom of the case. There is no indication that you will be getting a refurbished battery so I feel that I've been cheated.If you want a refurbished battery, there are places on the net where you can get them for a lot less $$$."
3,Summer read.,"Danny Boyle and John Ceepak patrol a seaside resort town. Danny is a summer part-timer, Ceepak is an Army veteran who has seen too much bad. Danny tells the story of a sleepy town that is jolted by the murder of a billionnaire - Reginald Hart. Hart is in the company of his twelve-year-old daughter Ashley and they are on the tilt a whirl at 7 AM.The daughter identifies the doer and the chase is on to find him - until Ashley is kidnapped and finding her becomes the priority. Reginald Hart's ex-wife and his hot young attorney make appearances, as does the chief of police, a former Army buddy of Ceepak.There is a cartoonish quality to the town, some funny lines but all in all a fun read. Not Hemingway but worth a few hours. Will check out the rest of the series."
5,Q> How good is this ?,"A> Better than ten furry footed swedish squirrels running merrily on your tensed up back reliving the pain of a an amazinglay hard day at the grindstone. In short this album is good, neigh extremely good. I would play this to my kids to my gran to my cat to my fish to my parents to my elderly neighbour people all over the world buy this album!As for the music, 12 tracks of unadultered mastery. picking out the best tracks if that were possible i would have to say idea track is a favourite, floaty melodic guitars giving way to a big chrunching chourus. music at it's best. On another related topic, scottish bands just keep getting better, I've been to seen mogwai and arab strap recently and suggest that, if you like what you hear with idlewild, check them out."
5,Idlewild just get better and better,"I wouldn't say that I've been the most avid Idlewild fan over the years, I've listened to their album ""Hope Is Important"" many a time and have really enjoyed it, their punkiness mixed with subtleties made them really interesting to listen to. However, with ""100 Broken Windows"", this could be the turning point where I become a totally obsessed fan. They seem to have taken a long hard look at ""H.I.I"" and chosen exactly what was good about the album and multiplied it by 20. There's melodies everywhere on this album, especially on ""Idea Track"", ""Roseability"" and ""Actually It's Darkness"", alongside punky, fuzz driven guitars (especially ""Little Discourage"" and ""Rusty"").Basically if I could give this album a better score then I would, it really is amazing. It's just a shame that at the time of writing this there aren't any clips available for you to check out for yourselves. Just go check it out, it's well worth it."
5,I am playing this CD over and over like a crazed lunatic.,I've degenerated into something like an obsessed tennybopper. I mean it. Somewhere between GBV and Shellac if they were from DC. Purepowerpoppunknoise. Listen to the samples above (Idea Track and Let Me Sleep are my favorites)& see fer yrselves.
5,"You thought the fire could protect you from it ,",Well it can't this is one of the best albums of all time a must buy.
4,Gertrude Stein said that's not enough!,"Idlewild provides a refreshing brand of punk that's rare these days. I found it interesting that the Amazon reviewer said it's like a punk version of REM, because that's exactly how I would have described them even before I read the Amazon review, particularly because the singer sounds a lot like Michael Stipe. This album is fresh and energetic, intelligent but fun. There is enough variety to keep you on your toes, too. This is the rock album REM should have made, instead of Monster. Unfortunately, they followed up with the disappointing ""The Remote Part"", which although it is still good, has ""safer"" songwriting and looses the edge and energy that made them so good.Overall, 100 Broken Windows is well spent money on an album that will age well with time."
3,Loved the idea of new series,"I have read and enjoyed all the Owen Archer books, so I had been really excited to hear about a new series set in Scotland at the time of Robert Bruce. Ms. Robb's research and attention to historical detail are as impeccable as ever, but I didn't really like this particular book as much as I hoped because I disliked her new series main character. The atmosphere and other characters are great, but Margaret (have I got her name right ?) seems unbearably selfish and perfectly willing to put other people's lives at risk (including her brother and uncle)to gain her own wishes. She is also extremely self-righteous. I hope Ms. Robb can make her ""grow-up"" quickly in the next novel."
1,Mystery writers need to deliver mystery!,"I thought this story was not up to the standard of the Owen Archer series. The historical detail is TOO painstakingly laid before us and the mystery disappears under the explanations of the intricate politics involved. This would still be forgivable if the novel delivered a good climax and denouement, but both were lacking. At the end of 250 pages, the writer abruptly leaves off and the heroine suddenly trusts a suspicious character for no well developed reason. However, all of the characters are shallowly developed and subject to capricious changes in behavior. After enjoying all of her previous series, I felt that MY trust had been betrayed."
2,"Dull, slow and lacking narrative drive","I found it hard to slog through this book, which kind of ambled around in exasperating curlicues. The writing was adequate, but it lacked narrative drive. It just never seemed to go anywhere. It wouldn't have been so irritating if the characters had been interesting, but there was no life in any of them (and some were downright incredible.) I did not understand the motivation of any of them. I was frustrated with the perennial backing & filling of the narrative, and even began to skip-read to keep moving forward. It starts picking up about two-thirds of the way through, but by that time, not a single character interested me enough to have made it worthwhile. If I had not enjoyed the Owen Archer series, I would have put this book down unfinished."
5,Beautiful,A wonderful album. I'm not a great lover of Mozart (I much prefer the passion of Beethoven) but this is truly beautiful.
5,Good overview,"This book presents its material in a well-organized manner.The author is a brilliant theoretical physicist and explains the concepts wonderfully.I recommend this book for any and all who wish to understand the essence of time, reality, and the universe in general.From a very personal level, the book affirms many of my own views pertaining to the cosmos and consciousness. There is indeed a Primary Mover (aka ""God""), and he exists and operates in infinite (!) dimensions."
5,Great personal view of feminist law,"Warm, witty and personal view of law and life. Well-written and lively. Brings feminist jurisprudence to life. Everyone interested in feminism, gender issues, philosophy, and law should read this book!"
3,Where psychology and philosophy meet.,"I read this to get some broader insights to match some volunteer work with mental health patients, and to look back over my career in teaching. It was helpful, although, perhaps, I was not in the best position to do the author justice"
1,"Rambling, not worth reading","Gardner is unconvincing and rambling, overlooking any hint of scientific evidence."
5,The best book ever!,This book pulls no punches. It tells you exactly everything about your sign and how the signs get along. It is the best book geared to gay men and their relationships. It offers insights and let's you know the challenges that lie in your relationship.
1,Yawn!,"Boring, predictable, no life at all. A complete waste of time and money. Being an island doesn't bother me in the least!"
3,It's ok for the price,"I received this backpack in january it has lots of pockets and zippers and things. The price paid was so great that I bought it with out much thought. It readily fits all my books as well as my laptop . This was all well and good I was happy with it, notice the past tense. The strap has nearly ripp off apparently my habit of walking short distances with just one shoulder stap being used is taking its toll. this wouldn't be a big deal if it had been used for more than a month and a half. So its alright for the price."
2,Didn't work for hypertrophic/keloid scarring,"I had a c-section and as soon as the steri strips were removed after surgery I began using mederma. I used 3 tubes of the product over 2-3 months and I have a very thick red, raised scar. The surgeon performing the surgery is very skilled and the wound was closed properly. We both expected it to be barely noticeable in a few months. Mederma just didn't help to prevent hypertrophic scarring. I will use silicone sheets next time."
3,Silent Conspiracy Rules!,"My favorite part of ""Silent Conspiracy"" was the number of analogies per paragraph. I mean, it don't get no better than: ""She was a curvaceaus cathedral where every brick house came to take notes."" Mmmm, mmmmm mmm. The images this man can evoke! And later, when he tells the babe his name is Lincoln like the Towne Car, not the president? Where can you FIND prose like those? I think every cop who ever thought he had a novel in him should read Lee Meadow's books before he even picks up a pen...or a woman of easy virtue for that matter...."
4,A Mystery Worth The Investment!,"Meet top notch P.I. Lincoln Keller as he travels and searches the highways and byways of the Motor City to find clues to solve an 8 year old missing person mystery. Lee Meadows introduces the reader to a tangled web of deceit, betrayal, blackmail and murder. His vivid imagination of Detroit's landmarks and life like characters engulfs the reader's interest to read on and on. Join P.I. Lincoln Keller and the Keller boys as they team up to unravel a two fold mystery. A mystery delight--pick up your copy today!"
3,"Great graphics, not impressed with quality","I've been looking at these sheets for some time for my 2 year olds room. I do just love the design. However, I'm a tad disappointed in the softness and the elastic around the fitted sheet. The fitted sheet only has elastic on the corners so the fit is not as tight as I would like. The picture does the sheets justice. Again, nice design I just expected more quality for that price."
3,Dog doesn't really care,"My dog usually loves toys, but he could really take or leave this one. I have even filled it with peanut butter trying to get him to like it because I want his dental hygiene to be good, but he could really care less. Hopefully he will change his mind and start to like it..."
2,Good music weak sound,"This is a good selection of Calo's music from 1942-1950, with great instrumentals like 'San Souci' and vocals by Beron, Podesta, Iriate and others. However, the sound is weak and distant. For example, if you compare ""San Souci"" on this Harlequin recording to the exact same song on the Calo ""Argentina to the World"" disc, it's hard to believe both come from the same original recording. The latter is vibrant and full, while this Harlequin recording sounds flat and far away."
4,If you are looking for something different Lamya is for you,"I think that ""Learing From Falling"" by Lamya is going to be an album that is definitely worth a listen. I think she will be an artist to look out for. The song ""Never Enough"" reflects a strong women. The song has a rock, blues, and soul feel with lyrics that any women can relate to. Who hasn't watched a man waste our time?! Lamya's not taken it. Lamya's voice is so flexible that her song ""East of Anywhere"" almost has a different sound. This song reminds us that we too need to find a place where we are free to think and feel good without even knowing why. A place where no one will judge, whatever will be will be. All we need is space. I can't wait to hear more from Lamya. I hope everyone gives her a listen!"
2,Junk--took it back,"Other reviewer was right. Product keeps quitting--and you have to pop out battery to restart it. This doesn't help me when I use product as a voice recorder--which was the main reason I bought it.Sound quality was better than OK, though. Plus earbuds were a (literal) pain to wear. Special over-the-ear bud hangers were impossible for me. I think you need Lyndon Johnson ears for these.Yes, it's only a hundred bucks, but I expect the thing to at least power up when I turn it on!"
3,Too predictable,"I love Olivia Goldsmith's books ~~ she has a saucy way of writing that just draws the reader into the world she has created ... but I am sad to say that this book isn't one of them. It's a big disappointment because I really was looking forward to reading this book!! However, if you're looking for a fun twist on romantic comedy ~~ this book isn't it.Tracie always go for the bad boy ~~ the tough guy who treats his women like dirt ~~ and they keep coming back for more. Jon, her best friend, is desperate to get a date ~~ so he asked Tracie for a makeover into a bad boy ~~ only to discover women were falling for him or is it for his bad boy image?Goldsmith explores the phenomenon on why women are attracted to the ""bad boy"" and not the nice boys, like Jon. But she didn't go into depth ~~ it's almost as if she wrote this book in a hurry as it's not typical of her writing style at all.It's still a good read ~~ but save it for the afternoon at the beach.4-5-02"
1,I Love The Cover!,"Based on the wonderful early publicity on Bad Boy, I eagerly picked up my copy. What a horrible shock! I am pleased to see some more realistic reviews coming out. Bad Boy really truly is a bad copy of Sara Bird's ""The Boyfriend School!"" There is so much that is wrong with Bad Boy, I can honestly say the only thing I liked was the cover design."
1,Hurrah!,"Finally folks are getting the courage to say what I haven't had the guts to say! Why is it that bad books are published just because the author has had a previous success? Bad Boy is a perfect example where I feel my money was taken by a publishing house under false pretenses. It is time for publishers to JUST SAY NO to bad books! Bad Boy really is a BAD BOOK! I have been steaming for months over this very issue and this very book, and hope Goldsmith's editor and publisher stand up and take notice. Bad Boy isn't worth the paper it was written on, and it is clear that not much thought was put into the outline, completion and editing of the manuscript. As a serious and copious reader, I think I deserve better. Read Goldsmith's other books, they are pretty darned good. This one really is a stinker."
1,One of the worst books I've EVER read...,"I had never read anything by this author before, but I read a decent review of this book and decided to give it a try. I didn't expect it to be great literature, and of the five books or so that I read a month, I usually enjoy one or two that I label as ""mind candy."" I knew that this book would fall into that category, but I didn't expect the writing to be on a fifth-grade reading level! Boring, completely predictable, and terrible, elementary dialogue. I could see the ending coming from the first chapter. Save your money, folks."
4,book of bad boy by Walter Dean myers,I recommend this book becouse it a book that teenagers could read. That why I think you should buy walters books.
1,"Bad Boy, Bad Book","Bad Boy, Bad Book. I heard in my library discussion group it was taken from an earlier book by another author, and I read the Boyfriend School, and boy oh boy it is lifted right from it. Geez! Is this legal? Bad Bad Author. Don't spend your money on a bad boring book which the author cannot even come up with her own ideas. If she was caught shoplifting this book, she would be in jail for ten years. Can books be given a negative star rating? -10."
1,A Disappointment,"I, similar to another reviewer quoted here, always look forward to Olivia Goldsmith's novels so I too snapped this book up when I saw it. However, before I cracked the spine, I happened across a terrible review of the book. The reviewer said that BAD BOY was awful and nothing like Goldsmith's earlier works. Nevertheless, I started reading, but found myself glossing over the first 50 pages or so, and then skipping ahead and reading the last 10 pages. That did it for me. I didn't need to waste my time reading the ""inside"" of the book, since is was blantantly obvious as to what was going to happen from the book jacket copy and the first 50 pages. I'm disappointed, because I really do enjoy Goldsmith's writing. I hope she gets on track with her next novel, but I'll peruse that one more carefully the next time..."
1,Rather Stinky,"I picked up Olivia Goldsmith's last novel, Young Wives, in paperback, and I couldn't put it down. I was thrilled to find she had another book out already in hardcover so I bought it .... I let my friend read first, and she said she liked it. After I finished reading about it, she told me she lied because she didn't want to ruin it for me.Tracie was so annoying, I don't know how she had any friends. Jon was so gullible, I didn't know how he made any money. There were so many subplots (unresolved) that I don't know why she even bothered. What happened to Jon's father? He was dying, so okay, that'll do it? What about Tracie's boss coming on to her? Oh, that's okay, don't do it again? Her life at work seemed abstract and unrealistic. I don't know why her friend Laura was even in the book, she was only on about ten pages. It was a crappy book, and I forced myself to finish it. How stupid does a guy have to be to do the things she was asking him to do??? 'Nuff said."
5,Spacey Hip-Hop Cuts,"When I first listened to this, for the first couple of tracks I was wondering, ""Where is all the scratching...?"" I had been listening to a few other prominent tablists like Qbert and Rob Swift where it seemed the most important thing was showcasing how GOOD of a tablist you are. This is not the case on this record. MMM has approached this record like he was making a soundtrack for a BADASS SPACE DYSTOPIA. With all of the many layers and elements happening simultaneously and MMM's scratching weaving in and out, you may find this has a LOT of replay value compared to other technical DJ records. This is one of the most moody records i've ever heard, up there with Radiohead's Hail to the Thief(sounds sophmoric/unrelated but I can't think of anything to match). Other more current ""DJ's"" have gloomy moods for sure and nice beats, but this albums scratch riffs put it in a totally different league, with more coolness and street cred and less snood."
1,No. Avoid. Do Not Buy.,"I bought it on the strength of this guy's association with the Beasties.When you listen, you realize just how limited his role is in that band.Where a record like ""Hello Nasty"" brims with phat beats and imaginative uses of beats and samples, Anti Theft Device is dreadfully dull. The beats just pound away, no attention at all given to the drum programming. The scratching here is only virtuosic in the sense that it may be technically proficient. But it is certainly not fun to listen to. This may be one of the most unlistenable records of all time. I cannot express how much it S*CKS!"
4,Heavy on table wizardry-high WOW factor-lacks composition,"Mix Master Mike's ""Anti-theft Device"", while impressive and a must have for anyone who appreciates progressive Dj culture, is missing the insightful compositions that make Cut Chemist, Shortkut and Dj Krush's work grounbreaking and destined to become classics within the genre."
5,Gives you appreciation for those who protect the wilderness,"Randy Morgensen may have been a very different person then you or I, but if you appreciate great storytelling against a beautiful Sierra backdrop then you will love this story. Eric Blehm draws the reader in with flashbacks of Randy's life and the search for this missing legend that keeps the reader very involved. The final climax leaves you with more unanswered questions about what really happened but still makes you feel like you have been there with these individuals along the way. Thanks Eric for great read!"
1,No hole in nipple,"One of the two nipples did not have a hole - I can see that the hole was started on the inside of the nipple, but it does not go all the way through. Very frustrating."
3,Replacement Sheepskin Insoles,The product was shipped and received in a timely fashion. They are comfortable and have extended the life of my sheepskin slippers. I would purchase them again.
4,Etat d'Amour,Etat d'Amour.The CD is fine and is in good shape. I already have several of these songs on her other albums.
2,Marine radio died after getting a bit wet,"Radio worked fine while it worked, but after sitting in my boat on a hot day when the huminity under the cover got o high it started to condense on all surfacess, it died. I thought a marine radio should have been able to withstand some moisture!"
5,Even better than expected!,"After reading a few reviews on this bed, I decided that it might give my dog the ""cuddle factor"" that he would be missing once I ousted him from sleeping in my bed. Sure enough, my dog cuddles into the corners and turns around in this fluffy bed until he finds just the right position. The bed is made from a material that is dog-chew resistant (at least in our case anyway) and is so big that a small human could cuddle up in it (I ordered the Extra Large). As my dog is 51 pounds, I think now that I should have paid more attention to the weight guidelines, as 3 of my dogs could fit in this bed. Nonetheless, it is a great bed, very large, and it looks lush and stylish."
4,A great 70's cd,This is a very good cd for your collection. I have really enjoyed having it in my collection. It sure brings back alot of memories.
3,Now let's run!,"My husband found this stroller to be fairly easy to assemble. He also liked the way it handled on his morning run. I, myself find the fixed wheel a little annoying and the wheels themselves seem a bit warped. But I am not the runner. (And it was a gift for him) It is quite attractive, and affordable. Our 9 month old daughter seems to like it, too."
4,Great stroller for the price,"I needed a jogging stroller, I have to say I haven't jogged much but still I wanted to. The stroller is light to be a jogging stroller, it fits great in the trunk of my car. The tires are huge which makes it really stable. I don't like that if the baby is too small he was hitting one side of the stroller and it was hard metal with just cloth cover in that area. He's bigger now so I don't have that problem as much anymore. You can't get a better jogging stroller for the price anywhere else unless it's used. I looked everywhere and as usually amazon.com was the best place to get what I needed :)"
4,Fun to Watch Period Film,"A war film fun? In terms of a movie that is hard to take seriously, yet is worthy of veiwing, yes. There is footage galore of period, (1951) Sherman tanks as well as T2 amored recovery vehicles and some M-26 Pershings. M10 tank destroyers masquerade as Panthers, oh well. The cast includes the mucn loved tank commandered who becomes a casualty and is replaced by a hard-bitten sargent with a past. We also get to enjoy a comical sidekick mechanic who knows the inferior Shermans must be replaced with a better tank. Really, good stuff, just don't take it seriously. Make some popcorn and enjoy!"
4,Good WWII era film.,"I saw this movie decades ago when I was a kid - I stayed home from school to watch it. I loved tanks and everything about them, and the story of the 'out-gunned' and 'out-armored' Shermans going up against the vast superior German armor was really scary for me.Now, years later, the movie was still entertaining and moving."
3,Wished it was on dvd.,I wished this movie was on dvd.......typical vhs quality. I do enjoy this movie....if you are into tanks this is a must film!
3,Rubin & Babbie,"This book was assigned as a text for my Social Work research class. The entire class found the book very wordy, chapters were too long and hard to focus on. As a professional the book would probably be helpful for self-teaching, but as a text book, it will bore your students to tears."
1,I've been Frauded,"The interesting thing about this book is that its' meticulously researched, but poorly written and annoyingly repetitive. Kohn is not a journalist or a college professor, but simply a ""concerned reader"" with a vendetta against NYT editors and current Times publisher for ""ruining"" his paper.I cannot question his research. It is impeccable, but the text presented isn't - its' repetitive, monotonous and downright tiresome. It doesn't help that Kohn likes reminding you of his thesis statement several times per page lest we suddenly forget mid-paragraph."
3,Take with food,"Seems to have all the stuff you need but not time released and hits your stomach hard unless taken immediately after eating a sizable meal, not just a snack or small breakfast."
4,satisfied,I'm getting all the nutritional goodness in just 1 capsul a day at a good price. I'm happy with my purchase. I ordered 4 bottles However 1 was broken during delivery. I wished they would do something about the packaging so the customers need not go through the trouble returning the broken product.
2,Carrot Carrie,"Unfortunately, I will not buy any vitamin online that does not have the ingredients and amounts (i.e. the back label) listed with the product. I'm going with the Kirkland Multivitamin because a consumer has posted the ingredients.Thanks if anyone can post the ingredients for Twinlab."
4,High School Days,Over the past few years I have been collecting CDs of groups I enjoyed in High School. I was elated when I found The Lettermen - Greatest Hits to be available. It brought back memories of my high school days and slow dances. The product is of excellent quality and have enjoyed listening to it. Good job. Thanks.
5,Classic Christmas Tale,"This is a classic movie that my family has to see at Christmas time. This movie has it all, even a squirrel to brighten your day."
2,A Classic That Deserved Better,"I doubt I need to add another review of the movie. It's been on a short list of required viewing every Christmas season. The disappointing part is thinking the upgrade from dvd to blu ray will reap improved audio and video. Sadly, the audio remains flat, compressed, and lacking in dynamics. Worse, the film transfer has to be one of the worst in recent memory. Every scene contains unacceptable amounts of grain and noise that's only magnified by the increased resolution. Granted, it's a silly comedy and not an Oscar winning masterpiece, but considering the number of copies the studio will sell every Christmas season you'd think they'd throw a few bucks into restoring it."
5,DVD Nat'l Lampoon,We couldn't find this product in the stores andwe watched it during xmas and it was just like it aired on tv.Love it! My boys are 11 and 9 and they really loved it.
1,Disappointing and Outdated.,"Predictable situations, with old and worn-out jokes, are loosely connected by a weak story-line. Perhaps it has sentimental value for some, but it is a very poor movie."
2,DVD equivalent of a lump of coal....,"(Instead of reviewing a film you probably already know, I stick to DVD special features)Those Extras:Commentary: Atrocious. Not only is Chase not there, D' Angelo doesn't shut up about her hair and breasts, Quaid has a handful of words to say, and Flynn---a sub, sub, sub-character---does all the talking like a bragging journeywoman actress.Overall: THAT'S IT???? No making of, no deleted scenes, bloopers (which are ESSENTIAL to a comedy DVD), no new interviews. This is the second DVD treatment of this film, what do we have to do, wait till the fifth time around for Warner to get it right!"
3,The Tape Was Fine..the Seller..dif story,Expect a nasty email from the seller if you give them less than many stars!
4,My favorite Xmas movie -- deserves a better DVD,"One of Chevy's best -- and my personal favorite of the Vacation series. Clark Griswold is at his most well-intentioned but dim-witted best in this one. This movie has lots of strong gags throughout. Just when you think the story is about to lose steam, Randy Quaid shows up -- and the comedy goes to a whole new level. (My favorite scene is still the ""sled"" ride into traffic). Top notch supporting work from Beverly D'Angelo, and especially William Hickey and Mae Questel (as the great-grandparents).This DVD was made back in the days when ""extras"" meant trailers, and maybe some production notes. This is also a full-screen prsentation which is bad news for those of us who care about such things. Hopefully a ""Special Edition"" of this Christmas classic will be released with commentary from the stars, a widescreen picture and any out-takes that might possibly exist."
5,I Love it,So nice to be able to watch when we want. Wouldn't be holidays without it to watch with turkey dinner.
4,Great additions! Movie is just OK,"I love the extra stuff packed inside of the awesome tin! The movie however, seems to be the same quality as the DVD. You would think they would have spent some time cleaning up the movie for it's Blu-ray release. This is one of my favorite movies of all time so it was still worth the purchase."
2,Not for children,"There are too many adult inuindos, vulgar language and nudity. This is not a family movie. Would not recommend this movie to anyone."
2,Family classic?,"I hadn't seen this movie in years and remembered it as much more funny compared to now. Then again the first time I saw it was as a young adult and about the time it was originally released. Chevy Chase was not too far removed from his SNL days (relatively) and still fairly popular. Now I guess with time I found the movie just silly and not particularly funny or entertaining. Lots of campy humor, too many close-ups of Chevy Chase's goofy wide-eyed look that became more irritating than funny, and several instances of foul language and sexual innuendo which I found uncomfortable to sit through with my 12 going on 13-year old son. There are some genuinely funny scenes, but by the end I was quite disappointed. I also suggest parents of early teen and younger kids may want to screen this PG-13 film first as the rating recommends before deciding to share it with the younger ones."
3,"Family favorite, but needs to be in wide screen",My Family really enjoys this movie every year. We were all VERY excited when it came out on DVD. But VERY disappointed in the full screen format. This was a theatrical release and deserves to be done in wide screen. The movie on its own gets 5 stars but this DVD only gets 3 stars. PLEASE RELEASE A WIDE SCREEN VERSION ON DVD SO WE CAN SEE WHAT WE'VE BEEN MISSING!! Thanks.
4,"If you haven't seen it, do yourself a favor!","This is perhaps the best Vacation film--any time of the year! Although others were complaining about the special features, and no deleted scenes that they saw on tv, I got what I paid for. I would do it again, and if you haven't seen it, rent it. I don't care what time of the year it is; any time's a good time for Christmas Vacation. Thank you for taking the time to read my review and feel free to leave helpful/not helpful feedback."
5,It's a classic!,There's really not much more to say. This movie has been a part of my Christmas routine for years and the Blu-ray format makes it that much better!
5,A Classic!,"This movie has become a yearly tradition in our home. Follow the Grizwold family as they prepare for the Christmas holiday and welcome family, expected and unexpected, into their home. The complications prove hilarious from beginning to end. You won't want to miss a side splitting minute!Kathy Althouse"
3,Chevy Chase,"Bumbling, mis-direction,pratfalls and goofiness: all you'd want in a Christmas tale with this family Good for a laugh and to find your own woopsies."
5,This is THE Christmas movie !,I cannot start the Christmas season without seeing this movie ! Clark Griswold hanging Christmas lights...can you picture it ? This is the best Lampoon ever. Even family who doesn't enjoy the Lampoon series really enjoyed this. I recommed it highly !
5,Very funny,We have watch Christmas Vacation at Christmas time for years.I had to up grade from VHS to DVD since we no longer have theVHS player. This will make you laugh.
5,Awsome!!!,"I Love this DVD and have for years. It just get scratched from my son. If you have never seen it , you must !!!"
5,It's a woderful life meets the real world,WOW !! By far the best of the vacation trilogy. Evrey moment of laughter is associated with a christmas memory
5,Best Christmas comedy of all time!,This is our family's favorite Christmas movie. No one has as much trouble with the holidays as Clark W Griswold Jr! He certainly makes you appreciate what little hassle you have to go through at Christmas time. Great film to see little Johnny Galeki shine!
1,Missing Half the Movie?,"""Full Screen"" means half the movie has been cut. While the movie earns at least 4 out of 5 stars, the insensitivity of producers of this DVD version is astounding. Even my low budget DVD player has the option of forcing a widescreen movie (16:9 aspect) to fit my 4:3 TV screen, so what sense is there in not releasing the DVD in widescreen?Even if the producers felt that this film was not worthy of widescreen, or that some views would have trouble with player options, then at least distribute it as a double-sided (wide/full) DVD. Same goes for the other ""Vacation"" DVDs currently for sale, which (by the way) should be collected into a box set."
1,Ugh,"I can't believe so many people enjoy this series. I couldn't finish watching this movie. It had no life, no joy."
5,Christmas Classic,"This is a true Christmas Classic. I bought the Blu-ray version to update the DVD copy I own. I watch this movie every year, just like a classic should be."
5,Give it 6 stars,"Christmas time always brings head aches and frustration because you are filled in a room with people you hate to see, but its that time a year where you have to be nice. Be a good sport and put this DVD on, All of you would die with laughter, swearing that cousin eddy is everyone but you. Enjoy!"
5,Great Movie.,This is one my favorite all time Christmas movies. I had the vhs version and wanted to upgrade to dvd. I would recommend it to everyone.
2,Fair Warning,I hadn't seen this movie in years and thought watch it again this year. It truly has been a LONG time since I've seen this because I don't remember there being so much language. Definitely not a movie to watch as a family...i.e. not for little ears at all! Just a little heads-up. I would have given this five stars but the language brought it down to a two...it's hard to appreciate this as an adult and parent. It would have been just as hilarious if they had left certain expletives out. Just sayin'.
3,THE PRICE IS NOTS,"I have an hddvd player the movies that amazon has left in this format should not be 46bucks.There just trying to screw there customers,everyday the price is up an down on alot of there items.I will not pay that price for a movie i watch once a year. Love amazon but they take advantage of there good customers."
4,Great movie,I love this movie. Nothing more needed to be said about it. It is funny and should be a Christmas staple.
4,"Good stuff, poor DVD quality.","It's a classic, of course, and my son and I laughed our socks off. But if you already own it on VHS, don't replace it expecting better sound and picture quality. DVD production was poor. In particular, the music in the sound track drowns out the dialogue. Very annoying."
5,Family Tradition,Had to keep the family tradition alive and get the movie on DVD. DVD is unscratched and plays wonderfully. If I woke up with my head sewn to the carpet I couldn't be more surprised.
5,Love this movie! Christmas Classic,I love this movie! It is definitely a Christmas classic that should be in everyone's collection.Quality of product is great and the on time delivery made for a 5 star review.
5,Thanksgiving tradition!,"Every year after Thanksgiving dinner we watch this as a family. We lost our dvd so I ordered the blue ray, it was good that we were also able to watch it instantly online because the package did not get delivered in time."
3,"An Entertaining Film, But...","""Christmas Vacation"" is an entertaining film, but like all of the ""Vacation"" movies in this series it's TVPG version is better. Many families are attracted to these films and would rather live without most (or even all) of the bad language. It would be amazing if DVD manufacturers would realize that putting an edited version of such films (along with the original) would be a big sales booster."
3,Be Warned,We had a older copy (made for television) an decided to upgrade our library with a Blu Ray version. I was shocked at the rank language and sexual innuendos in this version. This is not appropriate for smaller children
5,Our favorite Christmas comedy,"A classic that we've enjoyed for years. Every time I watch it I see another humorous subtlety that I missed in previous viewings. This movie is packed with such things.The DVD is top quality in visual and audio, and plays flawlessly in our player."
5,Awesomeness,"Who hasn't seen this movie?It's a classic, I can watch it over and over.Definitely one of the greats."
1,Awful!,"I wanted a collection of songs by Lou Rawls but this isn't it. All the songs are overproduced - too much musicical effects, too much singing fast with finger snapping, too much in the jive mode. I've been slowly replacing the tunes in this album with the same songs by other artists.Reminds me too much of Bill Murray's impersonation of a lounge musician."
3,some interesting new things about the First Lady,"Basically a collection of her answers and speeches, that she has presented all over the US. Her views on American lifestyles and how important a secure family is to a child. Hillary Clinton's years at Wellesley. It is a no nonsense kind of book. Written in a very down to earth style."
2,"great band, great songs, lousy production","i have seen this band over 20 times. they are hands down the best live band i've ever seen. unfortunately, only occasionally are they able to match in the studio the buzz they set off on stage. i was very excited about this album, as dash had been playing many of the songs live for some time, and about half the songs are great great great. they committed their fatal flaw by enlisting former drummer/now leader of the hideous cowboy mouth, fred ""watered down schlock & roll means commerical fortune"" leblanc. the sound he came up with for this cd plays completely against dash's strengths: the fast songs are slowed down, the drums are WAY too high in the mix, & the ballads are so sappy they're leaking. i have demos of the songs for the album and although the sound quality is lacking the performances blow this sad remnant away. summing up: this is a GREAT band, this is a LOUSY cd. HOAKY LIVES!!"
4,Al Martino- Greatest Hits,I bought this for 3 elderly people as Christmas presents. I know that they love the old songs and will enjoy this very much. This will be also taken to a nursing home for them to listen too also on our sing-a-long days.
2,Big Disappointment,"Even though I read all the reviews about Lonny's endless rambling before I bought the DVD, I figured ""how bad can it be""? Needless to say it is a huge distraction from what I love about WAR. Every great song that I love contains some kind of useless dialogue from Lonny and I found myself saying ""just play the damn song""! Fortunately I got all their albums from the 70's to listen to. This DVD will go in the closet."
2,Not the real War,"Once again this is not the real band. There's a group out there in the music land that's called Lowrider Band. There video's on Youtube is much better than this one that is being pond off as War Live Show. The quality was very good, but the photography was not very creative. It could have used better stage lighting. And once again it did not have the magic that one would expect of a group that has been around for nearly 40 years, but I doubt very much any of those guys come from the Old School except for Mr. Lonnie Jordan. They can loose those old time back drops. It's not 1976 for God sakes it's 2009...go figure?"
3,When a performer thinks he's more important than the music....,"War is one of the most wonderful and influential groups this country has ever produced. I have been a fan for many years and lucky enough to see them in concert 4 times, each one a celebration unlike any other. So I bought this concert and expecting a joyous experience l plugged it into my Blu-ray player and sat in shock as Lonnie Jordan spoiled most of the concert with his self-centered inane banter. Is this what happens when a performer (Lonnie Jordan) begins to think he's more important than the music? What a wasted opportunity, this concert could have been a defining moment in (Blu-ray) posterity for a legendary band. That being said War's music stands the test of time better than most and their music is still great but I still feel disappointed."
2,Avoid This DVD !,"I have loved the big Block Party sound of War for many years. When I saw that a live concert was available on DVD in Blu-Ray I jumped at the chance to own it. This DVD is a major disappointment. Their is absolutely no spark, excitement or spontaneity between the audience and the band. It's as if the concert-goers were bused in and asked to fill seats for 2 hours. Even the band seemed bored by it all. One of the guitarists chewed gum while playing. The War I remember is capable of much better than this."
4,How to receive Christian healing,"If you've wondered why all the ""faith healers"" believe they can pray for someone and they will get well, you'll find this book an eye-opener. If you've prayed for healing and haven't seen good results yet, you'll want to read this book for more insight. Based on transcripts of sermons, the writing can be a bit repetitive and not up to today's standards of discourse, but the argument for complete healing in response to prayer is thoroughly covered. Read for yourself and decide if you agree."
2,"Ordered a new one, got a used one!","I just got this tool. I ordered it new, but what I got was a used one. It was scotched taped in the package rather poorly and had remnants of oil running out of it. I will post later to see how it works. There might be a part missing inside, not sure yet."
3,Shadow..,"I'm not a pro but let me tell you where I think is the issue with this hood. I have 18-200 lens (SAL18200) and when I take shots at 18mm with this lens i.e completely zoomed out, I get a shadow from the hood in my pictures. This is when I'm using camera's built in flash.I'm planning to buy HVL-56AM flash and I believe the problem should go away. Hope this helps someone.Trushar Mistry"
4,Not-quite-universal,"My bike is a little bit older (it's an early-90s Nishiki ""mountain bike"" with canti brakes) and the mounting hardware for these fenders doesn't quite work. I ended up having to mount the fenders to the brake pulleys themselves in order to get them to stay. That's not the product's fault, though. I'm pretty happy with them, and would buy them again even with the creative mounting I had to do."
4,The Best of Prggy Lee,Have heard better performances of Peggy Lee's and most the the tracks I already have onother Cd's of hers Regards Barrie Mayes
5,If Only.....,"I discovered Yolonda's Genius as I was going through my ""box of books to read in a blizzard"" collection. When I noticed the Newberry Medal on the front I couldn't resist reading it while I had the time (in between canning projects).I was impressed with the flavor of this book; the contrast between the city full of violence, excitement and the small town Yolonda and her family move to after the trials of the city come too close to home. I love that there are so many successful black characters, especially women; lawyer, entrepreneur, student, musicians,etc. The flaws and strengths of the main characters weaver together a story full of real life in a modern world.I appreciate the author not including real swear words- the closest she comes is ""effing"" I liked that the speech teacher stuttered but had such insights into helping little Andrew. Great detail, descriptive but upbeat despite life's darkness."
4,Great Book!,"What is genius anyway? After being called a genius herself, Yolanda decides to look up the true definition in the dictionary. Upon reading it, she realizes that it does not describe her, but rather her younger brother Andrew. Yolanda is determined to convince the world of his special gifts, even if he is only a meek and mild first grader with a talent for music. This book paints a vivid visual picture with its descriptive vocabulary. Carol Fenner has a way of appealing to your senses. It pulls you in to the experiences of this young girl and her determination. This book is extremely moving. I truly liked ""Yolanda's Genius,"" by Carol Fenner. I feel that any young reader with an imagination will enjoy it."
2,These guys were amusing!,"Dr. Hook were always an amusing group. Their combination of locker room humor and MOR music struck a chord with the record-buying public in the 1970's.I always thought Dr. Hook was a very strange group to become popular enough to score top 10 singles. They were old, ugly, and musically mediocre. I would say it was a fluke that these guys ever became popular. It didn't hurt to cover Shel Siverstein's material either.The saving grace for Dr. Hook was the fact that they never took themselves seriously. It always looked like they were having a great time when they performed and always gave their audience a great time in return. And Heaven knows, in the 1970's a ""great time"" was often hard to come by."
4,right to the heart,"Branduardi's songs are no ordinary Italian songs, he gets inspired by Spanisch and even Celtic influences, and this results in a beautiful mix. Some songs are sober and almost quiet, but others make my heart beat go up. The love for life is always present in both rhytm and poetry. I think many listeners to both traditional and new music will like this album."
1,Definitely not the toy I remember,"I remember many hours of enjoyment with my Spirograph when I was a child, so I was very excited to introduce this to my five year old daughter. Needless to say, I was sorely disappointed in Hasbro's re-imagining of this classic toy. As other reviews have stated, the gears are much too small to properly maintain contact with each other, leading to stray lines across the design as the cog slips out of the form. The alternate shape form that insets into the main form is bowed, so maintaining contact with the paper was difficult for me, so my daughter found it impossible. It was also a good thing I bought a pack of colored gel pens to go with this since the included marker was completely dry. I can't speak for the durability of the toy since it won't be played with beyond Christmas morning. At $44.95, this is the absolute worst value I've spent money on for my child. Save your money and don't buy this toy."
1,Sad Sad SAD,"I am so seriously disappointed with this version of Spirograph.The old model had a squire and long Popsicle type disk along with several other drawing disks.The problem with this model is the prongs do not hold the disks in place very well. This causes the disk to slide under the drawing stencil. Oh and you only have three different drawing stencils/outlines unlike the old model. When I was young my sister (who is 9 years older than me) and I loved this ""toy"" and we would draw for literally hours. It was cool for every age group! I was so excited to see this in the ""deluxe"" version. My son was frustrated with this model in about one minute so I tried it out and I gave up after a few tries as well. Honestly, I ( a 40 year old lady) bought it for myself and just pretended it was for my son. Although, this is not an expensive toy.... It is NOT worth your money ... it truly does not work well.... and I am really sad about that!"
1,Terrible!,"My son received this for his birthday today. I had already read enough reviews that influenced my decision NOT to get it for Christmas... and boy were those reviews right on target! This is cheaply made... the gears don't stay on, the paper slips, and it's almost impossible to make a nice drawing, even for a mom, nevermind my 5 & 7 year old. Hasbro MUST go back to the old construction on these! They were a fantastic toy back before Hasbro bought it out. Boo, I'm sad, and I will be sending Hasbro a letter telling them what I think too!"
1,Very displeased with this product.,"I have wanted a spirograph for a while. I remember the old ones I had as a kid and they were great. This one, however, is made very cheaply. None of the circle pieces stay in the cut outs, so you can't get a good shape. They slip all around while trying to rotate them. I would not recommend this product."
3,Decent,"Once more, it doesn't work as well as I recall spirograph used to work. They are making the design way to complicated. We need a sturdy plastic stencil with nice indentation and a bunch of different sturdy plastic gears.This kit contains two stencils, a frame that is supposed to help the stencils in place, but it doesn't work very well, and contains a bunch of plastic gears of different sizes, but not shape. However the indentation finish is cheap and the stencils and gears are not thick enough to work flawlessly. So while it works, it's not great and nowhere near as good as the original spirograph Hasbro introduced almost 50 years ago... This is the kind of engineering I clearly don't get and will never get used too.I had the ""Kenner Spirograph Plus Drawing Set"" from the early 80s. Google this if you want good memories. It is now considered a vintage item apparently..."
1,Deluxe spirograph,"I bought for my granddaughter hoping that she would enjoy as much as I did as a kid. Unfortunately in their effort to get more shapes they lost the concept of the original spirograph. I had trouble keeping the main part held down so the wheel that created the art form would not ""slip"" and mess up the design. Let alone an eight year to be able to do it. My opinion is thumbs down,bring back the original!"
1,Ruined,"Hi. I liked this story. The writer did a great job of telling it. One problem. The main character repeatedly uses the word ""Jeezus"" as a cuss word. Like if it's spelled diffently God won't know. It ruined the whole book for me."
3,Bond,"its Bond. What else is needed?? We've watched for 40 years. I need 9 more words, so here they are."
5,Number of Discs?!?!?!,"I have 3 of the DVD Ultimate collections, and each one of those is a 10 disc set - keeping in mind that Blu - ray has more storage capacity per disc, does this mean that the entire collection on blu - ray additionally has the special features in these sets? I love the movies, I love the picture I get with the Ultimate collection, but other than, obviously, better picture and better sound (DTS 5.1 at a minimum) what does this collection offer?Even on blu - ray, it would stand to reason that to have all of the special features in the 4 - volume DVD sets, there would need to be 1 disc per title each of the 22 movies, meaning it would ALMOST have to be a 44 - disc set - am I right or am I wrong? Either way, a value even at twice the price."
5,I love the James Bond Movies,"Only a few towards Roger Moore getting older did I not care for, because I felt a younger man should have been in them, but for the most part the James Bond movies are pure extravaganza. I had been eyeing this collection for a while and when Amazon sent me an email that this set in blu ray was 129.99 (as I missed the Black Friday sale here and at Costco this set is 299.99), I jumped on it. This is a deal vs getting them separate. James Bond will go on forever..."
5,awesome,If you are a bond fan this is a must have if you want the set on bluray. It has all 22 movies plus a spot for skyfall went it comes out and a bonus disc with special features. It is awesome.
5,Great quality,These movies look absolutely great on blu-ray. I never thought I would see the classic Bond movies in such clarity before. Superbly remastered for HD.
5,Great movies!,"I watched several of these already. It is great! You forget what the ""hot"" things were but then you watch the movie and remember!I love this collection."
5,Good collection but cardboard blu-rae holder,The movies have excellent picture and sound. The cardboard case was not too impressive. So I bought some multi blu-rae holders on Ebay(less than $10 with shipping). Then I used MS Word to make large labels for the blu-rae holders.
5,AWESOME!,The early Bonds on Blu Ray look like they were filmed with an HD camera. Amazing video quality and great collectors set. I like that there is a space reserved for Skyfall.
5,Bond collection that is one of a kind,"This collection is fantastic. The movies come in two hard covered books, listed in the order they were released. Since each movie is in blu-ray form, it's like watching them for the first time. Great way to celebrate 50 yrs. of Bond."
1,Nothing special,"The item was promoted as discounted and I bought it for around 100$. Evan this price is too much. Case is good, but this 2 ""books"" is very simple. Only pictures and paper pockets for BlueRay discs. No print materials, no texts, nothing else."
2,"The packaging is great, but many of the movies are not","I forgot how many bad Bond movies there were until I bought this set for my son. We planned on watching them all together. We gave up after a few because of how out of date most are, and some are just very bad."
2,Not the best printer.,This unit was easy to set up and begin to use BUT the quality of the print was very bad. Actually returned the printer and purchased another brand.
1,Terrible printer,"This is the worst printer I have ever owned. Each $20 ink cartridge only prints a little over 100 pages, color or black and white. Every time you print an annoying box pops up, telling you how much ink is left, and when it starts getting close to running out (which it does very quickly), it keeps telling you to get a new cartridge. I think this printer is just a vehicle to sell the cartridges, nothing else. Print quality is okay, nothing outstanding, but it's a pain having to buy so many cartridges. Highly NOT recommended."
4,Greatest Hits?,She's one of the most gorgeous & versatile performers of her generation. Her polite and graceful voice will sure make you ask for more...The problem is that this compilation merely touches the heart of Crystal Gayles string of successes. It's a rather condensed mid-price CD which is okay for the casual listener. Recommended.
1,THIS GAME IS TORTURE!,"AHH why dont u have a no star option, even at 10$ this game is absolutely horrible, after playing for 5mins i already wanted to kick my dreamcast through the wall, this game is the worst game i ever played in my life.!! and thats a fact, stay away!! i warned you."
2,I've seen better!,"Tomb Raider for GameBoy isn't a good game well.... it's bad. The game has poor controls and the gameplay is very dull. Even though I'm not the biggest fan of Laura Croft, they are better than this. The reason why it gets the second star for not a terrible rating is the ability to play as Young Laura and the gallery for ad-ons which isn't the best but decent . I do not recommend this game because it isn't the funnest to play, get Mario Golf if you want good Game boy games!"
3,"Worth The Money, But Not Lara's Best","The plot and storyline of this game is great. The contols are VERY annoying. It is the most frustrating part of the game. The graphics are better on the PC versions of Tomb Raider. The movies seem like they were a half-done, rush job, get them done in time to put them in the game kind of movies. Either that or the wasn't enought space on the CD. I gave the game a 4 for graphics, a 4 for sound (it wasn't bad but it wasn't great), a 1 for conrols (I really hate the controls), a 4 for the storyline and a 3 for the overall game play coming out to 3 stars. The game, if you want something else to do to take up your time, is great."
4,Serves its purpose.,The foam hook protectors looked like a good idea but they tear easy. This can hold a heavy pick ax or a ladder without any problem. I expect the hooks will endure my rough treatment but the protectors will be destroyed before the year is up.
3,Quite Disappointed,"Till now I don't understand why this book covers incomplete commands for the programme. Although the book has a good explaination of the fundamental concept of 3D modeling or animation, the incomplete introduction just hinder the learning process being effecient. Even I can't find a lot of the commands in the index until I search it on the web (in accident!). For the beginner, this book is not a good choice except you think that it is worth while to save time by paying money. But is the incomplete guide book worth originally US$50? I don't think so..."
3,Allright relaxed saturday afternoon reading,"Although one can feel the age of the book, mainly in aesthetical terms, the story is good and well put into a comic book. There is a nicely worked-out subtle tension flirting all the time with narrative and drawings."
4,A twist of the old with the incorporation of the old,"This is definitely the old KMFDM that we use to know and love with their cartoon like drawing, heavy and distinct lyrics and beats, with a definite theme of the album. Some old sounds can be found within the album, such as in the songs Witch Hunt and Rabblerouser. Otherwise, this is a totally new sound with hyped techno mixed in with industrial; a somewhat different band then the old KMFDM. Still, it was a transformation that was expected. There is no definite theme/sound for the whole album, unlike the past KMFDM albums. Overall, its still a great collection of songs, a great album."
4,"OK, this is a good album, but ...","Lets be honest, theres no way that 'MDFMK' could match the originality and complexity that was KMFDM. While this album does have alot of solid, solid tracks, there are elements which get somewhat repetitive. These include Skold's guitar playing (for the most part using only the bottom two strings on the guitar ... just cant compare to Gunter Schultz) and their general use of synth keyboard sounds. However, this isnt a KMFDM album (hard not to compare...) and tracks like Hydroelectric and Be Like Me are amazing.Overall, MDFMK are great BUT the effort of KMFDM will be missed..."
3,Could've been better...,"MDFMK had some really good songs: Now, Witch Hunt, Control, and Be Like Me. Basically, any song without Lucia was cool."
5,D.I.Y. : Destroy What Destroys You,"I've waited for this album since the day that KMFDM broke up and Sascha announced he would bring MDFMK into being. I don't agree with others that ""Adios"" was mediocre; I thought it was an excellent album, and given the Columbine 'connection' some of the lyrics were just plain haunting (particularly Adios and DIY). This album continues Sascha's musical brilliance, biting vocals, harsh lyrics (listen very closely to Witchhunt), and the music we've all come to love. I missed a chance to see KMFDM back in 1995, and I'm still kicking myself for it. This album is worth every penny I paid for it, and then some. I can't even listen to the radio anymore: KMFDM/MDFMK have spoiled me completely. Fortunately, CD's don't wear out like audio tapes do, or else I would have bought several copies. I'll be listening to this one for a long time."
5,From out of the mists of time,"I studied classical guitar pretty intensely during my twenties, and when I learned Ralph had written this book I knew it would be wonderful. I was not disappointed. I can't think of a better person to author a method book for guitar called ""Improvisation and Performance Technique"" than Ralph Towner.During those years I had the pleasure not only to see him in concert with Oregon, but had the pleasure of his company and conversation at some of his gigs. His sincerity has always impressed me, nearly as much as his musical and improvisational talent. The sincerity of Improvisational Composition is at the heart of what I do musically, and in this my sphere of influence are Ralph Towner, Vangelis, and few others.Ralph's improvisation and performance is genius. If you get your hands on this book to learn to think in different approaches to your music, your purpose will be well served. Beautiful."
3,DESCRIPTION MISLEADING,"The Item is advertised as 600 lb capacity scale; however, in reading the description and the customers review -- it is stated that the scale has a 500 lb capacity!!! Which is it??? Before I buy I need to know what is the ACTUAL weight capacity. I need a scale that goes to 600 lbs with the BMI. Thank you."
5,Dazzling Western Swing,"Captures the Bob Wills & Texas Playboys era perfectly. Swagger, dance, sing along, whatever. Loved this CD, which I first heard on KPFA Berkeley."
4,Blue Nile,The book is slanted towards the history of battles fought over lands in the region and has only glancing information on things like the arts and culture of the region. The chapters on the French invasion of Egypt does have some interesting observations on the reactions of the various groups to being invaded and occupied that are still relevant and timely.
1,Cobalt Blue,I've yet to receive this product....???? will prabably give a grand review on the arrival....
4,My only regret...,"My only regrest is that I hadn't read this novel before seeing the movie ""Gettysburg"" several times. The characters in the novel are so compelling and profound, much more so than in the film. As soon as I could disassociate Martin Sheen (whose performance in the film,quite frankly, was stilted and awkward) with the character Lee in the novel, I learned so much more about the Southern general and I began to appreciate Shaara's literary accomplishment. Being a fan of Civil War novels, I was very satisfied with this book. I highly recommend it."
4,Good Seller,"Fast delivery, item delivered as described. I would buy from this seller again and recommend this seller to others."
3,A Great Civil War Novel,"The Killer Angels does a great job of explaining the Battle of Gettysburg in great detail, but still manages to keep you interested the whole way through. It gives you a feel of what it would have been like to fight in the war. Unlike some other historical books, the Killer Angels is very interesting, and is easy to learn from. The book starts out when both the Rebel and Union forces are almost to Gettysburg, and tells what happened in amazing detail through some of the key people in the war. I was amazed at how Michael Sharaa was able to tell all of the details of the battle, while still keeping the book interesting, and easy to read. He can almost take you into the battle, and let you feel what the people were feeling, and what they were going through. This is one of the best historical novels that I have read, because it was easy to follow and understand, and it taught me a lot about the Battle of Gettysburg."
4,Oh! How like a angel is man - a murderin' angel,"I have visted Gettysburg and taken the tour and all, but I never really understood the big picture of the battle until I read this book. Shaara documents the three days of the battle with amazing detail and clarity.The novel is not a straight chronology of troop movements, so it is not just a boring history book. Rather, it follows the battle through the eyes of several of the most important people during those three days (Lee, Longstreet, Chamberlain etc...). Also, Shaara does a great job describing the underlying reasons why Gettysburg took place - why the North and South were in the town in the first place and what this battle meant to the Civil War in general.Shaara's book is a beautiful account of the battle of Gettysburg, and I recommend it to everyone. You will finish the book with a better understanding of the logistics of the battle, as well as a understanding the underlying reasons of the war itself."
5,One of my favorite boks of all time!,"This, without a doubt, is among my favorite books ever. The story simply draws you in, regardless if you have or have not yet seen Gettysburg (again, pure perfection. The style of writing is an intersting three-person style, with different chapters narratored by different participants in the battle. It gives an unusual perspective of both sides during the conflict, exposing the characters of Joshua Lawerence Chamberlain, James Longstreet, and Robert E Lee to view. It is a complelling narative, and Iworthy of its awards. It is a tad stronger than either Gods and Generals or a The Last Full Measure in its style - after all, Jeff Sharra is not quite his father."
5,Well written,"The book is well written, and gives both sides of that uncomfortable period in our history. Mr. Shaara gives builds detailed characters that are historically accurate without being boring."
4,A little too realistic,"I don't think that I really agree with all of the reviews about this story.1) I agree it is very factual. All of the events and descriptions takes the reader to the battlefield. It reads more like a play-by-play of Gettysburg than a fictional novel.2) The military leaders come to life during the read. Lee, Chamberlain, and Longstreet are all heroes; each with their own failings.I did enjoy the story, however the plot was the battle of Gettysburg itself, rather than a fictional story set during the Battle of Gettysburg.I would recommend this story for fans of authentic historical battle descriptions. I would not recommend this book for somebody who is looking for ""Historical Fiction""."
1,It was a repeat of Gods and Generals,This book was the same thing as Gods and Generals. Add Damn and hell to every page and you've got The Killer Angels. Jeff Shaara is a much better author than Michael.
2,Very confusing and detailed,I thought that this was quite a bore I was made to read it for History but couldn't follow anything. Maybe if I knew more about the war i would get it but unfortunately I didn't.
5,Good understanding of the Battle of Gettysburg,"i didn't know much about Gettysburg except there was an important battle there and President Lincoln made his famous short speech there. But this book gave me a better understanding of what went on. We were visiting there and toured the fields, so it gave me a much better understanding, rather than just looking at monuments. After going up to Little Round Top, then reading how the union soldiers were dug in there and how the rebs were just mowed down as they came up that mountain, I could visualize the battle. The whole thing makes me think how sad and useless is war. So many young American men and boys killed."
3,"Boring, but with a touching ending.","This book starts off boring, with long spaces between the battles. I only read about a third of the first 200 pages. Once the battle starts, however, you gain insight to the generals' thoughts. You learn that they have feelings, and experience emotion quite often. Some people think that grown men do not struggle with the deaths of their friends, or that they are uninterested in others' lives. This staement is proven wrong with the raw emotion present in this book. This book is more about the pain and jubilation when losing of winning a battle, not the historican aspects. This book is a great read, but not unless you have to or really want to readit. I wouldn't recomend it for children or most young adults."
4,Personalities won and lost Gettysburg,"To understand history, you must understand the minds of the people who made it. It is this device that Shaara uses to tell the Gettysburg story. In Shaara's story, we feel the raw bravery and desperation that inspired Chamberlain to fix bayonettes on Little Round Top. We feel General Longstreet's moral agony as he carries out Lee's impossible order to attack the Union center. Finally, we understand Lee's religious view of warfare, which leads to his ultimate catastrophe. This book brought life to the sterile version of Gettysburg I learned in high school."
3,killer angels,"In general a very superficial account of Gen Lee,basically constantly hinting at heart disease without actually defining the problem as a cause for his faulty evaluation of Gen Longstreets recommendations. Lots of weather report filler.Maps unreadable and poorly interpreted as to who and where the troops were positioned and detail onthe the affected on the stages of the battle. I enjoyed the book but felt unfullfilled because it glossed over or omitted so many detaiils thta would have made for a more insightful understanding of this epic battle."
5,Killer Angels,"Absolutely INCREDIBLE. A book to be read when you are ready for an adventure. Only book which describes what may have happened at Gettysburg, and a lay person can understand. Simply written, and you feel like you were right there. This is my 2nd copy- 1st one borrowed and not returned. We just returned from a visit to Gettysburg where we went on the kids tour-another incredible adventure. The visit was the result of my reading this book several years ago. Even friends who are not history buffs have enjoy this book. Too bad the author didn't get to see the success his book was and his movie -which I also repurchased.If you are an avid reader-this is a different pace, which may spark your interests in a new and exciting way. Go on an adventure and pick up this book. Really good read."
3,NOT the best,"Look, many people aren't aware of it, but Cat Stevens had a very good career from 1975-1978. It's a VERY underrated three years in the legendary career of such a magnificent musician. True, Cat Stevens isn't perfect, but who is? That's right, NO one is perfect. Pick up the final three albums he made in the late 70's and get ready for some of the most splendid, melodic, and emotionally honest songwriting skills that will leave you totally satisfied.This collection only gives you what radio stations have been playing for years in addition to a few more songs. Big deal. It's really not that much of a drastic leap forward in terms of capturing Cat Steven's best moments compared to his old Greatest Hits album from the mid 70's anyway. So just pick up the final three albums he created in the mid to late 70's and prepare yourself for one beautiful and honest ride of musical ideas."
5,A book for all animal lovers,"""Best Friends"" will make you feel both joy and sadness. Joy for every animal saved and sadness for the reality that there are many people who treat animals as nothing more than disposable objects.As for the writing, the author was able to bring out in me the full range of emotions that I experience as a pet owner. The day to day happiness they bring, the worry when they are ill and the sadness when it is time to say good bye."
2,This is not Fondant,"It's listed as fondant, but when you get the bottle you will find it's simply Wilton's Icing Writing. They do make a Fondant Writer, but this is not it."
5,Great behind the scenes look of flight attendant training,Great behind the scenes look of flight attendant training at Frontier Airlines-with personal interviews and class by class video coverage highlighting different students difficulties and triumphs in the complex (more complex than the public imagines) training necessary to be a safety trained flight attendant with a modern US carrier
5,Excellent score!,"If you liked the music from the movie, you'll love this. I can picture the movie every time I listen to this cd, fantastic. I loved every song on the album!"
1,This is only the movie score and a few songs from the movie,"I saw the movie, and I purchased this CD to get the cool music that I herd in the movie. I am very disappointed in that when I bought this CD it was mostly the movie score which is NOT what I wanted. The score itself is excellent, it's more classical than pop music. The CD did come with four songs from the movie, but they weren't the songs that I wanted. I'm frustrated that Decca Records had marketed this to the 18-34 year olds. This CD is for middle-aged people in their 40-50's who like musical scores. I'm not saying that is wrong. However the movie was marketed for the ""Internet generation"" and not the ""Baby boomers"". I'm returning this CD and will wait for the ""Real"" soundtrack to come out."
2,Could Not Suspend Disbelief,"I read this novel all the way through and didn't find it totally terrible but also didn't like it much either. The biggest problem with it is that I couldn't buy into the other more overtly dualistic dimension that the main character kept going into whenever he fell asleep in our world. It just felt like the author was nakedly pushing his religious views onto the reader. Of course, I guess I shouldn't be surprised since this is 'Christian fiction.' This is the first contemporary Christian fiction work I've read and I have to say that I am disappointed. I could not suspend my disbelief and get immersed in the author's world, especially the fantastic realm with the scary bats. The plot ranged from predictable to meandering and was generally unexciting.If you'd like to read Christian fiction read C.S. Lewis' Space Trilogy or his 'Til We Have Faces. Or read Tolkien or John Milton's Paradise Lost."
2,Dekker's better than this,"While I usually really enjoy Dekker's books this series left me disappointed. The writing is far from captivating (boring is more like it). Like another reviewer noted the main character is just stupid, literally. I made it about half way through the second book and had to stop. Dekker should have cut this way down and made the main character more intelligent since no one that stupid could lead anyone effectively as Dekker tries to portray. Not his best by any means."
1,Gawdawful,"A good story can salvage bad writing. Superb writing can salvage a so-so story. This is a bad story made worse by bad writing. As lame as it is, it can't even be bothered to resolve itself in the end. Waste of time, waste of paper. Avoid."
4,Interesting concept.....Superb writing ability,"I've always wanted to get ahold of this book since I read the storyline. Then I read other Ted Dekker books and I knew I had to grab this one up too. I was not disappointed in the least. The writing is excellent and the story is fast-paced and will keep you on the edge of your seat. It started to slow for me toward the middle, but it definitely left you wanting to read more by the end of it. I highly reccommend this and any other Dekker book. You will not be disappointed."
3,"PERFECT NO, ENTERTAINING YES!","As my title suggests, is this book perfect? NO. Is this book a thoroughly enjoyable and entertaining read? YES!!I do not envy attempts to pen his ideas as he tackles a very intricate concept. Dekker is straight forward in his delivery which some seem to have described as ""simplistic"" language. Perhaps, however this takes nothing away from his story telling.A thoroughly enjoyable read and if I come away entertained than the writing has done its job."
5,Dekker outdoes himself,"I love every one of Ted's books, but this one has left me thinking for weeks after my reading it. It is exciting and adventurous from start to finsh, yet it is deeply moving and fresh in its allegory of good and evil, heaven and hell. I feel like I understand the beauty and richness of God's love in a way I never have before. It has left me closer to Him, and I can't wait for Red to come out!"
5,I NEVER read books twice.....,"This is the first book I have ever read twice. Be prepared to stay awake late into the morning hours reading . Don't be put off by the switching back and forth of time in the book, stick with it and you will be pleasantly surprised. I read all four books, black and Red being my favorite. The whole series is worth reading, enjoy !"
1,VERY DISSAPOINTING,"I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE, WE WERE VERY DISAPPOINTED, NOTHING LIKE WE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE. IT WASN'T EVEN FUNNY, NOT AT ALL WHAT JOHNATHAN WINTERS WAS CAPABLE OF."
1,Terrible dvd,"This particular dvd of JohnathonWinters is ""unauthorized"" and one can see why. If you're a fan, don't go for this package; it is a very poor selection of material, a lot of it irrelevant, and it even makes Art Carney look bad (well, he is bad here). Instead choose the ""authorized"" dvd that is available to see some fine stuff, both very old and very new from the comedy genius. Be warned about tbis one (very poor)."
5,This Album Is Great!,"I have to say that I'm really impressed by this album. When I first heard it, I couldn't believe how much I really like it. These guys are a unique type of death metal. You can definately hear the power metal and black metal sounds on this one. Some bands try way too hard to sound unique (like Cynic, who is a horrible mixture of death metal, jazz and techno), but not Children Of Bodom. These guys do it great. Even the synth isn't too bad considering synth can sometimes ruin an album. I'll admit, not everyone will like this album. For those who do like it, I give you credit for knowing when something is actually good and talented."
3,eh...it's alright,"First off, the guitar work is stellar, the drums are heavy and occassionally you hear some great bass work, but the vocals, god, they ended up driving me up a wall! It reminded me of a chained up pit bull. And that wouldn't be so bad, except nearly every song is like that!It is good symphonic power metal, no doubt; like Dragonforce with a metalcore singer, but the vocals get annoying fast, I wish they would drop the vocals and be instrumental. Did I mention the vocals get annoying fast?"
1,Didnt even get it,"I didn't even get the item at all. After I purchased the item, I received an e-mail informing me that I would be getting a refund for the item due to it being out of stock. Who sells an item that they don't even have in stock? The whole thing was a waste of my time and I hope this doesn't happen again."
3,juce newton's greatest hits.,"I love the cd, but it is hard to understand, I know the words, but I loan it to a friend and she couldn't understand a lot of the words, was disapointed,"
5,great cd,This was a great purchase! I bought it for a gift for my sister and she is thrilled. All the great songs from Juice!
5,Too many years,"""Love's Been A Little Bit Hard On Me"" is just one ofthe hits here that I had not last heardfor too long. A good blend of balladsand faster tempo tunes."
5,A great collection!,"Here they are! Juice Newton's biggest hits of the late 70s and early 80s. Included is Juice's original version of ""It's A Heartache,"" a hit later made famous by Bonnie Tyler. (This is the ONLY CD where you'll find Juice's version.) All Juice's best-loved pop hits are here: ""Queen Of Hearts,"" ""Tell Her No,"" ""Angel Of The Morning"" and ""Heart Of The Night"" as well as some great country singles, like ""The Sweetest Thing"" and ""Shot Full Of Love."" This is a fantastic CD for anyone interested in Juice's early years! Very satisfying and fun. For Juice's later hits, take a look at ""Emotions"" or ""Anthology,"" also on CD."
3,Hits and others,"I wanted the hits, I got them and some others I don't remember on this album. Great to have the hits...guess I'll save my opinion on the others until I figure out whether I really like them or not."
1,If I could give this zero stars...,"I would! Neither of my (two) cats recognize this as actual food. They just think I am making them smell something. They don't understand that they are supposed to try and eat it.Do not purchase this, it is a waste of your money. I needed something to put pills in for my female cat as she is tired of 'Pill Pockets' and won't eat them anymore. I guess I am on the lookout for new products...any suggestions??"
4,Flavor-Doh Pill Helper,Flavor-Doh works on a few of my cat's while other's won't eat it. I would still buy more because it takes a lot of stress of of trying to pill them.
2,just like wwf attitude,this game is just like wwf attitude but has more types of matches because this game is more hardcore than wwf attitude da game has matches involving table ladders and chairs oh yeah and i believe this game has create a wrestler if so i am goin 2 add wwf wrestlers 2 this game 2 pretend like it is wwf invasion n ecw game da commentary is similar 2 wwf attitude game and da moves are similar 2 wwf attiude but with different names and has female wrestlers wwf attitude doesn't have female wrestlers da reason i didn't rate this game any higher than wwf attitude is because i didn't no many of da characters n da game and i not 2 familar with ecw style compare 2 wwf style which i no alot more about
4,good buy,"This lamp is well worth the money spent on it. The only con is that the switch is on the cord, rather than on the base of the lamp, which is bad since I prefer to hide the cords on stuff. Still, well worth the money spent."
2,Hope you like halogen!,Read the product descriptions thoroughly!Don't just go by the extremely short list of features that this store provides. This lamp requires a halogen bulb -- a fact buried on the page and only found in the editorial review.Plus the base is quite heavy and costs more to ship back than to keep and try to sell to a friend.
2,Be Careful! Make sure you can find replacement bulbs.,Nice lamp while the bulb burns. Mine burnt out after just a few months of light use. I have spent the past 3 months trying to locate a replacement bulb. Be careful - I wouldn't buy this unless you unless you have a good source for replacement bulbs. I've given up and am thinking about returning mine.
4,A Fine Collection,"While it may be unhappy circumstance that some songs from the movie have been left off (however Elvis Costello IS there, just with a better song than High Fidelity) what we are given is great. The song cycle fits together well. Also, for those disappointed about missing the other songs from the movie. THere will be more than one volume (I think Gross Point Blank had three soundtracks ultimately). Well worth a buy, even if you have most of the songs already. Bonus points for the shot of my neighborhood on the back of the CD."
4,A good collection that can't possibly please everybody,"There are some great songs on this soundtrack, some of which I'd never heard before. I was also excited to see that one of my all-time favorite songs, ""Oh! Sweet Nuthin'"" by The Velvet Underground was included. It's one of rock's perfect songs and deserves the attention. The fact that everyone will argue about what songs are included or excluded here is completely appropriate given the themes in the movie/book. Everyone feels passionately about the music they love and thinks everybody else is insane. That's exactly how it should be."
3,so much is missing!!,"OK, the music that is on this CD is cool, because: ALL the music in the movie was cool. And, like Cusack explains to us in the film: the making of a good compilation is an art. And the WHOLE music of the movie was a very, very unique and cool compilation. Some of the stuff I hadn't heard in years and never thought I'd hear it in a current movie, like ""Mendocino"" by the Sir Douglas Quintet - when have you heard that the last time? And in the movie something like ""Mendocino"" is directly followed by something completely different, which is a nice contrast and makes the whole thing so unique. The CD comes across as homogenized and sanitized in that regard: no rough transitions, all the ""good"" classics (Dylan, Velvet Underground), but no odd pieces to make it interesting. And: why was the great version of ""Baby, I love your way"" by Lisa Bonet or whoever dubbed her left out?"
5,A terrific collection of music,"This disc contains many good tracks from numerous obscure and largely unknown artists. In fact, I'm so pleased that John included ""Always See Your Face"" on this CD. LOVE was an astounding band. And Arthur Lee is still alive, but he's in *jail* on a stupid charge."
4,"Great Book, Movie, and Soundtrack","Great compliment to this movie. I will always be reminded of the way I felt leaving the theatre when I hear ""I Believe"". Dylan's ""Most of the Time"" is the topper. All white, male, 35, and alive (and heartbroken) will love this one.Throw in the Clash and get 5 stars."
5,Pleasing slice from the music cornucopia of the film!,"Yep, this movie just makes you want to go home and organize your own music selection. This soundtrack is great because it gets you some diverse music you might not already own, and you can listen to the whole thing and get a vibe from the movie. I love it!"
2,Jack Black saves this one.,"I loved the movie. I laugh again and again each time I play Jack Black's version of Marvin Gaye's Let's Get It On. He puts so much heart into it, you have to love it."
1,Muy mal,"El esfuerzo personal o no, como leí este libro yo se sentía que abajo me ""hablaban con"". El autor haría probablemente a profesor de jardín de la infancia excelente, porque solamente hay enseñanza por la repetición consideraba una opción. Me siento que todo el ""consejo"" se habría podido decir en cerca de 10 páginas o tan."
3,"Things That Make You Go, ""Hummmm""","Definitely kept my students in their seats and caused some very serious discussion and thought. Remember, 'we can all agree to disagree,' when airing this DVD."
4,Past solid work,"This cd contains a good mix of rock'n'blues from Delbert's work in the mid to late seventies. The musicianship holds up very well even compared with today's quality recordings. Keep in mind, this is Curb Records re-releasing a different mix of tunes which they own the rights without any imput from Delbert. If you don't have these tunes on cd already, then it's a must for real Delbert fans."
4,Stork Craft Traditional Glider,The glider is an attractive piece of furniture and works very well. The colors are what we were hoping for too. We highly recommend this chair. For the price it is a very good buy.
5,The BEST thing that EVER happened to me!,"This game changed my life for the better! This is evidence of video games being a positive influence! It has been a dream of mine for some time to be a race car driver and this stroke of genius, has allowed me to feel as though i am living my dream! Right now the only thing that would complete my life is to meet the individual who created this masterpiece. I am a very avid gamer and I do not doubt that he is a fasinating human being, an artist if you will!! I, Kristen ... may never be a ""real"" race car driver but, because of 4 Wheel Thunder i sure feel like i'm behind the wheel! Thanks 4 Wheel Thunder, you've made me a VERY happy woman! EVERYTHING about this game rules! I truly don't know where i would be without this game!"
1,Not a how to,"This book had much of the same information that was repeated in chapter after chapter. I appreciated the sections on safety, but there was little focus on heterosexual intimacy."
5,"Guide to Giving Pleasure is a ""Must Read""","No one ever pulls you aside and teaches you this kind of stuff in school. And, if you are not a prude, you may discuss it with friends or partners. But, if you want to know how, and be discreet about it, I recommend this book. It gives you examples for technique, but also answers some other questions that you may never have even known you wanted to know. Your partner is always the best person to go to when wanting suggestions, but if you don't want to ""suck"" at sucking, you may want to read this first."
3,"Good, but Radical Orthodoxy is better","I purchased the book out of admiration of John Milbank's writing style. I agree with John Milbank's ""Red Toryism"" and his admiration for the writings of Rowan Williams. His comparison of the status of the Anglican Communion to Eastern Orthodoxy is wishful thinking. His central thesis that reason being divorced from theology is non-sensical is compelling. I prefer his writing in ""Radical Orthodoxy."" I fail to see the relevance of Slavoj Zizek, whom he cites, to the field of theology."
5,OK,It Was bought for my son. He loves this movie.He can watch it over and over.Money well spent.Give this seller AAA++++
2,From the cover...,"Who's afraid of the mistletoe? Sarah Calder, that's who.Why is she afraid? She can't really say...The answer is that Christmas means family, emotions, remembering the past. And kissing can mean the same things.But now Sarah need help, and she can only get it from one person--her ex-lover, Tage. The last time she saw him was on the Iditarod Trail with his ""family"" of sled dogs. But his responsibilities have changed since then. He's recently become guardian to two young children--his orphaned niece and nephew from Sweden.Add Sarah and her impossible dog to this household and you have a Christmas unlike any other!"
3,Interesting autobiography,"In this autobiography, James ""Bo"" Gritz writesof his career in Special Forces during the 1960sand 1970s, his private searches for POW's insoutheast Asia during the 1980s, and hissubsequent charges of government coverup ofthe POW issue. As a result of the latter, andof his discovery of CIA involvement in thesoutheast Asian drug trade, he broke withthe conservative Special Operations circlesand formed alliances with dissident groupson both ends of the political spectrum. Gritzalso touches on many other alleged conspiracies here.This book is a must for anyone researchingsuch 1980s scandals as Iran-Contra as well as thePOW-MIA controversy and CIA drug involvement.However, the book is long-winded, and worse,Gritz has made some truly unsavory political allianceswith racist far-right figures - somethingsure to diminish his credibility in many circles."
1,OLD TEXT WITH MANY ERRORS,I used this text to teach a machine design class a community college. I has many errors in equations presented as well as in the answers presented in the back of the book. Problems are presented without any illustrations were needed.
3,A fair recording,"I enjoy Pierre Boulez's interpretations of Mahler. Why do I give it 3 stars? I have come to a realization that I am not a fan of the Cleveland sound. While the orchestra plays cleanly, and expressively it has a disturbingly bright sound which is not evident at first but gets increasingly noticable the more you listen. I don't dislike this c.d. but I bet Chicago's recording, or New York's is better. Boulez is great and I don't take any credit away from him, but his recordings with chicago is better."
2,Dust Everywhere,"I tried this product after using Arm & Hammer, Tidy Cats, and at least one other brand. My cat is not picky about his food or litter and has never missed his litter box. I slowly integrated this litter with Arm & Hammer Litter and it wasn't until it was nearly completely World's Best Cat Litter that he decided to take a dump less than two inches away from his designated area.This has never happened before but luckily that was the only incident. Looking over it, I still can't find many reasons to continue purchasing this brand. It tracks EVERYWHERE. I have a black table nearby my cat's litter box and it looks like someone dropped corn flour every time my cat exits his designated area. The odor control is mediocre at best.I do not recommend this litter nor will I be repurchasing this brand."
2,HORRIBLE TRACKING MESS & ODOR,I must admit it clumped really really well. It had great odor control for about 5 - 10 days and then it smelt soooooo bad. Tracking was pretty gross. The litter ended up all over my room and the dust from the litter left prints on my bed rugs basically everything. This litter is much better than others but you will have to clean up around the litter box a lot! My cat would get this litter stuck in his paws! I must admit it is pretty expensive but if you have a small cat and you buy an enclosed litter box and a really amazing rug/mat you should get it.
2,Doesn't clump pee,"I'm confused at all the great reviews of this product. I've used both the single and multiple cat varieties of World's Best Cat Litter and neither one does a good job of clumping pee (sorry this post is sort of gross, but such is the nature of cat litter). The pee just breaks up and the litter becomes saturated with it until it's so smelly and gives off so much ammonia that you have to change it before the litter has actually run out. The only reason I gave it two stars is because it's biodegradable.For those of you who want an eco-friendly (biodegradable) cat litter that works well, try Swheat Scoop (sp?). It clumps well and helps control smell...I actually prefer it to any other cat litter, eco-friendly or not."
3,Okay for everyday wear.,"This is a bracelet I will wear casually and not really care too much if anything was to happen to it. The quality isn't too shabby as the other reviewers suggested, but I do agree that the stones are VERY light blue in color.Suggestion: only get if you can get it for a super discounted price like I did. I wouldnt pay anymore than $20 for it."
3,okay but poor tech support,"I purchased this printer because it was Vista compatible, and had the card readers. We generally use it as a stand-alone, not connected to a computer. The biggest problem with this is that the photographic prints are too red. HP's website recommended turning off the photo fix button. No difference. HP's technical support is very poor. I have e-mailed and called repeatedly and still no solution. As long as the printer is connected to a computer, it seems to be able to handle photos. Stand alone - I get better quality prints with the right color from my old HP Photosmart 1115 (which is not Vista compatible)."
1,Save your money,"There are better retrospectives on P&G out there which contain all the hits, not just these 10."
4,"Great content, okay sound","This CD is fairly basic with only 10 tracks, but it does show the musical stylings of another important group in the history of the British Invasion. The sound quality is fairly good, but it is a hollow on some songs."
3,"Worth the money, but just","Peter and Gordon were responsible for three singles of interest; if one needs to hear them again, this is the collection worth buying. Anything else would require more money and time than P and G are quite honestly worth. And there you have it."
3,MIXED REVIEW,"SURPRISINGLY ENOUGH, THE THING I FIND THE MOST DISAPPOINTING ON THIS CD IS THE VOCALS! THE MUSIC IS TIGHT, TIGHT, TIGHT. RECODED AT BOB MARLEY'S TUFF GONG STUDIOS, AND FEATURING A LOT OF GREAT JAMAICAN REGGAE MUSICIANS, I JUST FELT THAT FLO AND EDDIE COULD HAVE TRIED HARDER ON THE VOCAL SIDE. THEY SOUND GOOD, BUT NOT GREAT, AS THEY USUALLY DO. NOT ENOUGH OF HOWARD KAYLAN SINGING LEAD, TOO MUCH MARK VOLMAN."
1,Redwall - The Siege (2005),"Black and White. Where's the color shown on the jacket? Poor quality reproduction, even to the point of seeing the white area above the reel. How do I get a refund?"
3,It's Ok. :D,"I was a bit dissapointed in the animation when I rented this- but it's alright! It give's a back-story on Matthias's past before he came to Redwall Abbey. They jumble around the plot a bit, but overall it's alright."
5,Who gets more mileage outta their back katalog than KISS?,"Just when you thought our favorite blood-gurgling, pyro-loving, powerchord-pummeling glamrock clowns had thrown in the towel on their ""Farewell Tour,"" out comes Alive 4. Hardly useful in this age of superior and more technically advanced metal- KISS still hold a special place in my heart. Their music got me through many hours studying pharmacy garbage during my hated college years, and for this I tip my hat to Paul, Gene, Peter, and well I guess Tommy Thayer now? In any event, I could do without the in-between song banter by Paul (who sounds 'gayer' than ever). But that's my only major gripe- production values are crystal, the playing is heavy, and the symphony was a nice touch. I would like to see a new studio set from these guys- hey why couldn't they get Bruce Kulick back? His KISS character could have been the mysterious body snatcher alien that ate Space Ace!!!- David J Newman 2003"
1,bad,"deep purple and metallica are the only bands that were able to pull off the orchestra in the background. one reason, they were HEAVY METAL at the time. now metallica as sold out and deep purple is classic but oh well. kiss is a pop metal/hard rock. im pissed off that they would try to pull this off. because they failed."
3,Its all For The money.,"Gene had a idea to rip off Metallica and package it 300 ways past Tuesday and did it. I only like a few Kiss songs and they are on here so I got and I was saddly let down, Detroit Rock City my favorite Kiss song killed by the symohiny, I wish they would not have played on that song. Duece, Lick It Up, Pyscho Circus, and Shout It Out Loud, Love Gun, God Of Thunder, and Rock And Roll All Nite come off good but all else is bad! and Ace was the only good thing about this band and now he is gone!"
4,Are you retired or not?,"Kiss has always been my favorite band, but I'm tired of buying new albums with the same old songs. C'mon fellas, be loyal to your fans. Stop making albums with the same music just to make money.I only rated it a four becuase Kiss doesn't make any bad songs. Would love to hear something new. If not, let it go."
2,Nothing special.....nothing special at all,"I have been a KISS fan for 25 years and this concert could have been so much more than what it was. With the exception of 2 songs, Shandi and Great expectations, it was practically the same set as there last 3 tours, (and what did ever happened to ALIVE IV?!?). As far as the orchestra goes, it was overpowered by the guitar, and as far as the two together, you can be just as satisfied listening to ""Destroyer"".It could have been sooooo much better if they didn't play the standards, and dusted off more of there catalog that was more disserving of an orchestra."
3,Over Cranked Guitar,"I've been a KISS fan since, well, it seems forever. I've enjoyed everything they've done over the years. Anyway, this would have been a great arrangement of great songs if they had a great producer. The concert has its moments. Unfortunately, Paul's guitar just about tramples over the symphony in every song. Yes, they are getting older and vocally don't quite measure up to their own standards. It's going on 30 years for heavens sake. What do you expect? They still put on an awesome show with lots of energy. As far as Ace is concerned, he's made his choices and let down his fans yet again. My last words...give us something new."
1,Horrible,"I couldn't get into this book, not even one of the short stories. Boring, over done. Don't bother."
1,Why The Blind Following?,"How can anyone possibly stand Pantera? What is the guy from Aurora, Colorado thinking? How dare he insult us! Pantera is NOT great. I don't know about you guys, but I don't call drill sargeant/wrestler bellows for vocals talent. I call it incompatence. Especially when it's accompanied by swearings, warning labels, explicit subject matter, and anything else that can possibly upset people. Don't get me wrong, I love heavy metal. And I own many CDs with warning stickers/labels(KoRn, Slayer, Marilyn Manson, etc.). But Pantera crosses the line, especially when they seem to be working on geting a warning label on the front of the cover."
1,Sickening!,"I laugh at those who say this is music. It's just plain noise. Every other word in 'War Nerve' is the 'f' word or some other cuss-word. The same with the title song. F this and f that, how can someone who is mature possibly love this. Phil Anselmo must love to cuss at the listeners. Worst yet, he screams ""F--- METALLICA"" in the middle of 'Living Through Me(Hell's Wrath)'. My favorite band on Earth. That really turned me off to Pantera. I gave this CD to my brother, who doesn't even listen to it(he plans on returning it to the used CD shop). The bottom line: the utter worthlessness, grossness, and lack of talent speaks for itself. Damn! I wish I could of given it, not 0, but -5 stars. Pantera deserves a million negative stars."
1,Since When Is This Great Metal?,"I can't believe people actually like this. Real great metal is Motorhead, Metallica, Motley Crue, Megadeth, Scorpions, Iron Maiden, Slayer, Anthrax, KoRn, Judas Preist, Dimmu Borgir,Gn'R(except UYI2) ,and tons more. The guy(aaron or something) who said ""no sellouts here"" was obviously refering to Metallica and KoRn ""selling out"". Which they didn't(of course Korn did play 2 rap songs, but let's forget that). Pantera has neither the talent nor the guts to make a good record. James Hetfield and Jon Davis are so much better singers than Phil Anselmo. Hetfield and Kirk Hammett along with Munky and Head are GREATER guitarists than Dimebag. As stated before, Pantera just make noise and Great Southern Trendkill proves it. It's the worst metal CD I've heard."
4,!!!!!!!!!!Yeah buy this,this cd is sick this and far beyond driven is panteras HEAVIEST so buy this !!!!
5,I Love This Album!,Great album from Pantera!Their heaviest one to date and i hope their next one is just as heavy as this one! I hope they kill some more trends too with the next album!PANTERA RULES FOREVER!TRENDKILL RULES!
2,Boring,"This, in my opinion, is Pantera's worst to date. I'm terribly dissapointed with this. As for selling out, that get's to be the most over used word thrown at a band. What does that word mean to you? Every single band gets accused of selling out at some time or another by someone. I wouldn't take that word too seriously. Anyway, Pantera didn't do very well with this album, but I was satisfied by reinventing the steel. I thought it was great even though it was probably considered to be Pantera's sellout album. Guess what, I DON'T CARE!!!! I did like 2 or 3 songs on this cd though so I gave it 2 stars."
2,Buy a better band.,"There's one big reason Pantera's still around, and that's Vinnie Paul. A superb drummer will hold ANY band above water (get it?). The guitar work is simplistic, and though I applaud Phil's ability to scream for 20 minutes straight without taking a breath, it's not that impressive. GST is uninspiring; Pantera is loud, but unispiring. Go buy something else."
5,To Pantera Hater,"for someone who Hates Pantera you sure are fixated on them, especially dimeDo us a favor...Post a link to a recording of you playing guitar so we can see how better you are than Dime...who knows, you might be, but i doubt it."
1,PANTERA USED TO BE 80'S GLAM ROCK!,"well, pantera sucks, funny how they say don't be trendy or you suck when they are one of the most trendiest bands on earth. korn sucks, limp bizkit sucks, metallica sucks, those are all fake metal bands, cannibal corpse, mortician, disfigured,jungle rot, those are real metal bands."
1,Why won't they discontiue Pantera albums?,"They should consider it.Pantera is a absolute pathetic joke on metal, and a plauge on music in general.They should just ban this god awful music for good.All this is is macho man, bravodo chest thumping from baggy short-wearing posers who want you to THINK that they are tough-guys, much like Fred Durst or Eminem.And as for Dimebag Darrle?, he was never any good. I'v never seen such mediocore tripe be hailed and praised on the level that Pantera is, only Slipknot fans are worse.Just listen to this music and think to yourself that, if it was YOUR band that had wrote and recorded these songs, you would most likly be laughed at and branded as a bunch of posers.It will only be a matter of time before this band and it's career are completely laughed at and realized for the cr@p that it really is."
1,The Tattle Tale is a waste of $$ for use with cats!,"Don't waste your money, especially if you buy it online/Amazon because you can't return it! I put the device on my couch and my 21 lb cat jumped on the couch, walked around it and sniffed it. The Tattle Tale never went off. Cats land too lightly and, seemingly, make no vibrations. I tossed a coaster on the couch and the device went off, but didn't really scare my cats anyway. The sound isn't very loud or startling. I recommend Ssscat. I bought two of them from PetSmart and they are the only cat deterrents that actually work."
4,Essential,"Just finished reading it -- great book!The author's analysis is objective & professional. Probably 50% of policy books today have some kind of serious bias, but I found Mr Pollack's assumptions to be fair & his conclusions to be well-reasoned. He seems to have a good command on different sociological, psychological, political and religious aspects of the Iranian society, and he presents his case without relying on guess work or unsubstainted/dishonest assertions.I do think, however, that Mr. Pollack should have included more material on the role of Sunni-Shiite tension within the Islamic world, and its effect on Iran's policies. In addition, the author could have focused more on the perceptions Muslims in other countries have about the US & Israel. After all, while devising a strategy for relations with Iran, it is imperative that such basic complexities are considered."
3,"A Capitol-EMI ""Ten Best"" Cheapo","Capitol-EMI put out a whole series of these ""10 Best"" cheapo CDs about 15 years ago, some others being The Beach Boys, Peabo Bryson, The Lettermen, Peggy Lee, The Tubes, The Fleetwoods, The Classics IV, Al Martino, Little River Band, and Jay & The Americans.There are no liner notes - in fact just the single page cover with a list of the others in the series on the reverse. All the selections are originals, however, and if you happen to be seeking a specific song by the artists concerned, this series is a good place to find them and at a nice price.Otherwise, for most of the artists concerned there are now some larger, much more comprehensive compilations which, although costing about double or triple the price (or more), also give you many more of their hits and, in many cases such as with those from Ace of London, detailed background information and discographies.These were fine when CDs were still a novelty."
5,NFG Rocks My Socks,"What can I say? New Found Glory is an amazing band. Even this CD, with the band so unpolished, can make you rock out in the middle of traffic. They did a great job of transforming these songs into something like punk. I'd recommend this CD as a must have in any music collection."
5,Superior,"This is the best eight dollars I have ever spent. These songs aren't parodies - they're improved versions of the songs. Good!! Do yourself a favor and buy this CD. 'Cause it'll be the best eight bucks you've ever spent, too."
5,Great cover music,This is not original New Found Glory. But it makes songs like these much much better
5,Awesome Band!!!,"This c.d. rocks!!!! It's awesome. I love all the tracks, especially Glory of Love and That Thing You Do!! Definitely buy this c.d. if you like bands such as Blink-182 and Fenix TX."
2,Waste of time,"I really really liked Nothing Gold Can Stay. These guys are really good songwriters. So why did they waste their time doing this? I mean covers can be a cool thing to do at a show, or on a comp or to just have one on a regular album, but to make a whole album is just asinine. Well, if you like hearing punk versions of songs that aren't punk in the slightest, then buy this album. It does absolutely nothing for me, but, hey, at least it's only 8 bucks."
1,Terrible Condition,"Just as another buyer mentioned, as soon as I opened the box screws and washers flew out all over the place. I attempted to simply screw the loose tabletop into the base myself but it was impossible because the screws were stripped. One side of the table was also bent and there were several scratches on the table top as well. I highly suggest not wasting your money on this table. Mine was just shipped back, and I'm currently awaiting a refund. Also, it took a week langer to get to me than it should have."
5,GREAT!! Finally something I can understand!!,"I love this book, for people who aren't big history buffs, but want to get some background on the church with out reading a million boring books, this is the one.And Oh my goodness! the last 2 reviews for this book couldn't be anymore general or jaded in their accusations! The last one sounds like he is mad because he's trying to figure out what God is doing in his life and wants to blame it on somebody, I guess Rick Joyner and the like will do huh? It's a book review not a review of the things you don't like in life. Come on people!"
4,I liked it..I REALLY liked it!!,"I saw a rating of ""1"" by another reviewer...and I couldn't beleive it!As a fan of horror fiction, (Vampire fiction specifically), I thought this book wonderful!You have a truly nasty, evil, vampire and an un-likely hero in the ex-horror novelist turned 'handy woman.'The story is about a 'family' of vamps, who due to the actions of one of their own are forced to move away from their current home, to escape discovery.They then settle into a small town and by the local, derelict, movie theatre and hire a woman and her father to fix it up...butone of the vampires has a more sinister plan for the theatre than showing film...she wants to use it to trap her evening meals.The story is fast-paced and very enjoyable. And, most importantly, you care what happens to the characters."
1,Good Product - But Bait and Switch,"Product from this company claimed to be New, When Arrived the package was opened and product parts looks used. Would never buy from this company again"
4,"Good, but not so ""beginner""","I bought this dvd because while I used to do yoga about 3 times a week, I haven't practiced in a few years, so I thought I'd start out nice and easy with a beginner video. My initial thought was: This is for beginners?...I could easily follow along, but I think that could be because I'm not really a ""beginner"". I'm just haven't done yoga in a while. It seemed like it was harder than it should be. But then again, it might just be because I'm out of shape.Overall I do like the video a lot. I would have given it 5 stars just as a yoga video, but gave it 4 because I thought it was a little bit challenging for a beginner."
3,mixed bag,"Why I enjoy this video:My favorite yoga class was taught by a student of Shiva Rea, but I moved away and haven't found a replacement class yet. This video met my expectations well -- fitting breath with movement, fitting both with music, etc.I was in 2 car accidents in the last 14 months, and while rehabbing I fell completely out of the habit of practicing yoga. This is a gentle re-introduction.Why I would not recommend this to others:My #1 pet peeve is that Shiva Rea skips the half split on the right side in one of the sequences. Every single time I do this video I have to pause it and add the half split in. It drives me crazy!!!As others have mentioned, this video does not contain much in the way of explanations. If you're new, I suggest you either go to a class in person, or, if that's impossible, get one of Barbara Benagh's videos -- they're much more clear."
5,Shiva is wonderful!,"Shiva Rea is wonderful as usual; she is simply the most enjoyable person to watch doing vinyasa yoga. This DVD isn't really for beginners, you have to have had some yoga experience to keep up with her, but it's excellent to do flow yoga with and I would suggest her DVD's to anyone wanting to further your experience in flow (vinyasa) yoga."
1,"It's disgusting passing off rerecordings as ""Greatest Hits""","Okay...not only are these versions very noticably different from the originals, but nowhere are you able to tell that these are rerecordings until after you open the package. This is a disgusting practice! Is it any wonder that many artists/labels feel an ""us against them"" feeling with the buying public?"
4,NOT the original recordings...but not horrible,"I do agree with the reviewers who felt that they were mislead by this CD. There are too many ""re-recordings"" of classic music out there, and we as consumers deserve to know up front (as in CLEARLY STATED on the outside package) if that is what we are getting (I waited forever for Capitol to put out a ""best of"" Merle Haggard collection without putting re-recordings on it). We fans want the ORIGINAL recordings for our collections. Now having said that, this collection is really not so bad. Bobby's voice has held up well over the years, and the arrangements of the songs that I have heard are reasonably close to the originals. For my own enjoyment I will stick with my ""Best of Bobby Goldsboro"" issued on the ""Collectibles"" label (original recordings, excellent booklet, highly recommended), but these re-recordings are really not as bad as some would say."
5,"Excellent novel, haunting ending","I want to join the other reviewers in strongly recommending this engaging and highly interesting novel, Keepers of Truth. The plot is a mystery story taking place in a decaying Rust Belt city in the late 70s. The solution requires some careful thought to unravel, although it is never entirely spelled out, but in any case, the book is not a genre novel. I beg to differ from some of the other commentators: the troubled protagonist's musings on America are not meant as straight commentary but represent his periodic deterioration into a delusional state. In the years since I read this book, it has really stuck with me. The ending is deftly handled and an example where insinuation is more effective than a blunt statement.Despite the Booker Prize nomination, I think this novel hasn't received the attention it deserves. Read it for yourself and enjoy. Collins' later career doesn't seem to have lived up to this effort so far, but he is still young."
5,"Lynn Garafola's ""The Ballets Russes and Its World""","Thank you to Dr. Garafola and Nancy Baer for their long-awaited, wonderful and beautifully illustrated book on the Ballets Russes. It is an extraordinary contribution to the fields of dance and art history. It will be well-appreciated in classrooms and libraries across America. It is also a useful text as it can be appreciated both by the aficionado of ballet history, as well as by the novice, trying to learn through scene design and costume shapes the myriad interpretations of the twenty-year life of Diaghilev's Russian ballet company. Any return to the modernist era is of use to students of history and performing artists of any generation."
5,Timeless Music,"Doo-wop aficionados cannot fail to love this compilation. GaryTroxel and the Fleetwoods harmonize within a very elite category of groups such as the early Beach Boys. Their big hits""Mr. Blue"" and ""Come Softly"" speak for themselves, but payattention to the haunting music and lyrics of ""Tragedy"" as well!"
1,Doesn't work!,"I bought three to run my holiday lights through. From day one they've only worked intermittently. The lights may come on but 15 minutes later they'll turn off despite being set to turn off 4 hours later. Sometimes they may come back on again for a few minutes but sure enough, they turn back off after a while. Pointless."
5,"Easy, easy, easy","This is much, much easier to program than the competition. It's hard to explain without seeing it in your hand but the point is that there are no little pins to lose. There are pins, lots of them, but they're permanently in the unit and easy to manipulate. It's extremely easy to program and you can program many on/off cycles during the day."
4,Appliance Timer,This is a very good product.I do not give it 5 starts just because if you have a power autage the clock gets out of wack.
1,worked once. only once.,"I purchased this timer for an outdoor light that plugs into a shed's outlet. The timer worked on the first night that I used it. After that, I couldn't get it to work again. It still works in the constant ""on"" position, but this doesn't serve the purpose I need! Not recommended."
1,Did not work,"After reading the positive reviews, I found my experience frustrating.I had been using the X-10 system, but was having too many failures and it could not control a few outlets, so I decided to go back to manual. I decided to try the Sylvania due to positive reviews and the pinless concept (over Intermatic timers).The first timer did not work at all, dial would not progressThe second timer worked for about a week and then stopped keeping time.Too much hassle to return.It may just be a bad lot, but I would avoid these."
3,cap clone falls short,"based on ""Captain America and the Avengers"" for genesis and arcadecarbon copy of the other ""avengers"" gamesnot as good as genesis and arcade versionsharder than other versionsfun game though, difficult"
2,False Advertising,"I am a big Eric Schweig fan, so naturally buying this product, I thought he'd be in it a lot! He is on the cover.... Well, no such luck, he is only in it for about 10 minutes total. Besides that, this movie is extremely long, boring, and cheesy. The plot is drawn out, and at times almot incomprehensible. I had to watch it in 2 segments because I almost fell asleep watching the first half. Tantoo Cardinal is funny but also hardly in it. Although I am overall content with it, I wish I had realised what I was getting before I ordered it."
2,The best designs are not included,"This is a very beautiful book full of gorgeous creations. However, all of the designs I fell in love with have been left out. For example, in the ""Birds and Beasts"" chapter you are shown a wonderful rug and cushions featuring a hunting dog, rabbit, squirrel, falcon, and pheasant, but you are given a much less appealing monkey design to create. I find this very frustrating and disappointing. It seems the book is mainly meant to show off the author's work. You can order the missing patterns online, but be prepared to pay $100-$200 or more for them."
4,Terrific!,These are well-produced studio arrangements (none of that brassy/tinny sound)that are great for dancing the Cumbia.
2,"Should be ""seed beads"" in the title","I purchased this book based on the 4 star review ratings and the title. While this is a beatiful book with many great pictures, there is very little on making your own findings. It is mostly about seed beads, something I am not very intersted in. There are also lots of purchased findings, but even a novice like me knows how to use a purchased clasp! If you want to learn how to make your own findings, buy another book. Bead on a Wire is much better and great for begineers."
3,Still basically a bead book,"Due to it's title, I was persuaded to buy this book. I work in PMC and I'm interested in fine silver and sterling silver findings and wire. I found no information on dead soft, half-hard, and hard drawn silver, nor any help in what gauge wire to use with what size and weight materials. It may be a spendid book for beaders, but don't let the title lead you in to thinking that it addresses a wider audience."
3,Nice... but it's not magic,"To everything there is a season is a wondeful verse taken from the Bible... and while the book is presented well, some of the power of the words are lost. It was a nice book... but it did not carry the magic I had hoped it would.Marcus"
3,I don't enjoy a book where I hate all the characters,"I thought Allie was a maniacal jerk, his wife was a complete weakling, and the children were under helplessly under his spell. Another reviewer said that he rooted for Allie to fail. I completely hated him.Now this isn't a negative opinion of Paul Theroux's writing, or the plot (which was interesting at times), or anything like that. But I can't recommend a book where I can't stand one of the main characters."
3,Great book-Utopians are a selfish lot indeed,This book is not about survival. It is about how idealists and utopians want everything to be done their way. The protagonist isn't trying to help the world. He just wants to create a world of his own and have the whole world thank him for it. If youve read about Che Guevera or Fidel Castro you'll see what I mean. I couln't rate this book high because I couldn't honestly stand the guy. He drags his family off to who knows where when all his kids want to do is lead normal lives. He corupts and destroys the peacefull lifes of the natives. Who wants to read a book about a guy who acts like this!
4,Amazons kindle,"I had read The Mosquito Coast many years ago via paper back, and throuhly enjoyedit. But now with the Amazon Kindle E-reader the experience was even that much better as I was able to in-large the print, truely helpful at my age."
4,animation history 101,"Though there are certainly moments of charm and wonder, and some of the drawing is representative of the man's considerable abilities, these early efforts don't hold up as the jaw dropping entertainment that Gertie the Dinosaur had provided back in 1913. (A much better representation of McCay's genius is found in any decent collection of his Little Nemo in Slumberland or Rarebit Rabbit newspaper cartoons.) But this stuff is invaluable in its historical role of propogating all the film animation that followed. If you fancy yourself a student, then the viewing is beyond satisfactory, but don't try to quiet the kids with this stuff."
4,Action without senseless violence,"This movie was highly entertaining, not to mention all the eye candy of the all-star cast, but just watching a cast of actors by skill execute a brilliant plan. I was more than thrilled with everyone's performance. They were humorous and had the audience cheering for the robbers!!! By the way, did I mention all the eye candy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Hollywood Has Long Been Out of Ideas,"Let me see if I get this striaght: We're supposed to pretend that George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon and Don Cheadle (who?) are Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Peter Lawford and Sammy Davis Jr. Give me a break! I could barely sit through this self-serving slice of backhanded hommage. What a slick and disingenuous waste of time and money. But, this is to be expected from a Hollywood totally bereft of any new ideas. That Steven Soderburgh is being touted as some kind of ""auteur"" is an even sicker joke. Andy Garcia and Carl Reiner, what were you thinking?This film is my nominee for a moritorium on remakes."
4,Great movie,"Good performances by Clooney and Pitt, who are planning to rob a casino. Very funny, some great lines, and very real characters. Also features Scott something or other of Felicity - he and his partner are hilarious!"
3,Decent...but not the original,"The good thing about ""Ocean's Eleven"" is that it is a retelling, not a remake. Had it been a remake, my head would have exploded watching Brad Pitt try to play Dean Martin.However, that is also the problem. This is NOT the original. Dean, Frank, and Sammy were larger than life personas. They had a presence which will never be duplicated. This is not to put down Clooney, Pitt, Damon, et al. Nobody could recreate the magic of the Rat Pack. And the ending of the original was classic. The new ending, although pretty good, just can't compare to the original.Basically, if you loved the original, you will not be completely satisfied by this version. Clooney and friends gave it a great effort. But stick with the Rat Pack."
3,Almost as entertaining as the original.,"The original was a funny thing to watch, with Sinatra and the boys making a relatively crappy, campy movie. This one is just as much fun, but for completely different reasons.The heist, though highly improbably on many counts, is fun to watch the team assemble and execute. All the members of the crew, from high profile Clooney and Pitt through Bernie Mac and a Chinese gymnast, are superbly cast and dead on..."
2,YA..A..A..A..A..A..WN!,"A dud pure and simple. Period. Agreed some films call for a suspension of disbelief on the part of the viewer but this is ridiculous. Clooney and Pitt play ultra cool crooks in this ultra cold turkey. They spend their on-screen time looking good and talking smooth while hatching a harebrained plot to rob a casino owned by Andy Garcia, who looks his usual quiet menacing self. There's the mandatory (and wholly unnecessary) love interest in the form of Julia Roberts... what's SHE doing in a dud like this?The only reason I've given this movie 2 stars is because of the star cast.I got so bored watching the movie the first time that I switched it off after the first few minutes. It was only because a friend had lent the DVD to me that I decided to watch it once before returning it. Big mistake.My advice: this film's not worth buying - it's not even worth renting, unless you want to waste a precious couple of hours of your life.You've been warned!"
4,Entertaining and well paced.,"Ocean's Eleven is directed by Steven Sunderburgh who also did Traffic and The Limey. The tale takes place in Los Vegas and is basically an updated heist movie. The planners get their crew together, plan the heist and execute it. Sometimes the audience is aware of the plan, sometimes not.The film is somewhat gimmicky at times and the plot stumble a bit. But don't let that distract you. There is some great dialogue especially between Clooney and Pitt, as well as a twist or two during the execution of the robbery.No, this isn't a ""great"" film. What it is, is a lot of fun, with some good acting and directing.Good movie."
5,Sofisticated criminals against mobbed casino owner,George Clooney and Brad Pitt are fantastic. For the criminal mind or the criminal at heart it has a touch of funny with the smooth charactor of deception. It is as good if not better then the original Oceans 11 with Frank Sinatra.
1,Falls Flat,"I recently rented the movie; and apparently I'm in a small (but vocal) minority. This movie had lots of star power, but the script gave them no place to go. No chemistry among the stars, either. Many scenes people looked, frankly, bored (... or perhaps the director was going for 'cool'. Who knows?)I'm willing to suspend disbelief for a decent movie, but this movie asks viewers to stop thinking all together. So much of what was done was not even remotely plausible.Too bad. This could have been a great movie."
1,They should have hired a writer,"This is probably the worst written movie I've ever seen. There is no character development, the plot is tedious and predictable. The actors walk through their roles like they can't wait to get out of there. I'd avoid this one like the plague."
4,IT Was GREAT! Beware of Bad Reviews,"... I come to tell you if you like movies such as snatch, thomas crown affair and mission impossible this film is for you. Its a mixed of them all.... It was great. Characters where funny and entertaining. The plot allowed you to get involved. Throughout the film I keep asking myself how, why and saying that was cool. Oceans 11 is about ripping off the town that wins no matter how lucky you think you are....Its a group of pros planning and pulling off an intelligent heist. You will be satisfied.The DVD has a great look at the movie making of the film. Picture quality is somewhat good. It has a dark smokey feeling which I guess is the casino aspect. Sound is also good. At times I had trouble focusing in on the movie becasue of the picture but I still enjoyed the film."
3,Entertaining,"This movie has a great cast with a decent story. Wouldn't think Ocean's 12 would be made and once was enough. Entertaining enough to sit through once, but the DVD is a bit of a waste because I don't see myself watching this film again."
2,"Another ""Sting"" movie","We've seen it before but usually done better, we are teased with a few short scenes of Julia Roberts but nothing to wait for"
3,A Bad Movie,"The plot was silly, the acting was bad, the script was boringly written. I didn't like this movie at all."
2,Unwatchable,"Ocean's 11 is a stupid, predictable bad movie. Someone please tell Steven Soderbergh that he has completely sold out and is artistically bankrupt."
5,Clooney and Soderbergh at their best,"Daniel Ocean has just been released on parole after 4 years in prison, with 10 other guys he is planning one of the biggest job ever by robbing 3 casinos at the same time. Is he in this purely for the money or is there something else he's looking for?Ocean's Eleven is one of the smartest heist film I've ever seen, with an excellent director, a talented cast with some great chemistry, and smart dialogues. The movie was fast paced, unpredictable, and a lot of fun to watch, there was never a dull moment. Even though the movie lacked character development, but a decent plot and solid performances by Clooney (as Daniel Ocean,) Roberts (as Tess) and Pitt (as Rusty) more than made up for it, and created an enjoyable experience for me.I've never seen the original and therefore cannot make any comparison with the 1960 film, but I can say for sure that Ocean's Eleven is a great way to spend 2 hours at the theater, and I hope you enjoyed it as much as I did."
3,Just a fun movie... nothing more,"Excuse me while I hit this fly that is buzzing around my head... ok, now on to the movie.This is an entertaining movie, but has nothing to say, which is why it's fun to watch. This movie grabs your attention from the beginning and lets go at the end, you won't think about this one much after seeing it, but it's a blast while watching it. Flashy, arrogant and whole lot of fun."
1,So much talent - such a disappointing movie - what a waste .,"This movie is one prime example of good casts gone bad -- and with a script/story line that's about as deep as a tire track in mud. In other words, the producers must have paid/offered an insane amount of money to all these (usually) top-rate actors -- there's absolutely no other explanation for it.George Clooney and Brad Pitt basically phone their performance in, while Matt Damon runs over during the intermission. And for Pete's sake, if Julia Roberts grows any more teeth, they'll have to go vertical.It's the most banal buddy movie that's completely implausible, has no depth and the quickest wrap-up you'll ever see.RENT it (if you must) -- save your money and do NOT buy it!"
3,Pretty good,"I thought this was a decent caper movie. Although I did not expect singing, I did expect a little of the Vegas cool that the Rat Pack had in the first one. Also, the one female star, Julia Roberts, seems to only have about seven or eight lines in the movie. Other than that she just sighs, smiles, or looks confused. But as a caper movie, still pretty good."
5,Made him happy!,My nephew loves this movie. He now has his own copy. He has watched it several times since Christmas and will watch many more times.
1,Awful,"I tried to put ""no"" stars in but it wouldn't let me so, I give it a GENEROUS ""1"" and here is why: Take a decent tale that takes some imagination, great stars, great locations and an audiences desire to see such a film and make it into the slowest, boring piece of drecht! I blame the director, who it appears wanted all his actors to play it ""cool"" and laid back - so most of the film sounds like people causaualy rehearsing lines.. absolutely no energy! The first version of this film had its' flaws due to a minor and wander plot but the personalities made it come alive. This has a well put together plot but the people driving it are dullsville! Thankfully I decided last minute to rent this before purchasing."
1,SAD....REALLY A PITIFUL VIEWING,"I can't believe Pitt, Roberts and Clooney stooped to this type of acting. It just goes to show if you're a top name movie actor, it doesn't matter what the contents/plot of the script, people will flock to watch because of the names involved. I rented the movie, so all I lost was the video rental fee."
4,Old Hollywood Meets New Hollywood,"This is a perfect example of a movie where Hollywood got it right! Ocean's Eleven combines old style class with new world flare in this edgy, high-stakes, winner-take-all, cloak and dagger redo of the 1960 classic. Fresh out of prison and looking to get back into the action, Danny Ocean (George Clooney) enlists a group of 10 fellow ex-cons and ""professionals"" to take down his current target: his ex-wife's boyfriend, Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia). Among his crew is his old friend Rusty Ryan (Brad Pitt) and new recruit Linus Caldwell (Matt Damon). But when old feelings between Tess (Julia Roberts) and Danny start to resurface, the result threatens the entire mission. Can Danny overcome his feelings for Tess and focus on the heist? Can Linus pull off the biggest pick-pocket of his life? Will Rusty ever stop eating? This movie lacks nothing: just the right amount of intrigue, action and glamour...not to mention stars. A good addition to any espionage-lovers DVD library!"
4,Oceans Eleven,"Entertaining. Great cast. There was a problem with the playback. It kept freezing. My husband said there were some technical missteps, but we enjoyed it."
5,You won't be sorry.,"Not only was the movie absolutely terrific, but the added features are absolutely entertaining. I've seldom watched the ""extras"" on DVDs, but Ocean's Eleven has a wonderful commentary with Andy Garcia, Brad Pitt, and Matt Damon. the result as they comment while the movie plays is insightful and special, and Brad Pitt even references MST3K, for those of you who could understand that kind of set-up. I would have to say I watch the commentary with those three about as much as I watch the movie by itself.For once you get not only a terrific movie, with terrific actors, but a nice surprise with the extras."
4,"For me, an enjoyable read but you could probably love it or hate it","As with all first person narratives, if you don't love the narrator, it's hard to like the book. Lydia is a warm, outgoing mother of two who's also an ex lawyer living a rich suburban DC life. What's interesting is that it's hard to really like her yet so easy to relate to her. She's incredibly human as a character and watching her go through the whole range of emotions in dealing with her husband, her children, her children's school, her friends, it's hard not to root for her, even if you aren't a mom and aren't in her socio-economic circumstances. But she's a bit heavy handed when it comes to justifying her nouveau-richness and sometimes you want to scream at her for her egocentricity and inability to detach herself. Still, the point is she is human with human failings like the rest of us and her view is so well written that I admittedly had trouble putting the book down."
4,Brilliant!,"What a great read. I couldn't put this book down. First Erin is popular and then all the sudden a new girl has moved into her place. She no longer is invited for sleep-overs, going to the movies and the like. Should you intervene, since their mothers are your friends?The women get snippy with each other, as women tend to do. But then another private school has accepted Erin and Thomas. Should they make the switch? What about their friends and lives at Alden? Read and find out! I promise this isn't a deeply profound book but it is still enjoyable.Warning one small explicit sex scene. About three sentences I think.Also, it was very true on some levels, with the competing and the feelings women have."
3,Very different,"I haven't read this book in a long time, but it was definately interesting. I had read Carla Tomaso's other book, The House of Real Love, and I truly enjoyed that one also. The book isn't so much about who is lesbian or gay, but more about the nature of human beings and the feelings that they experience throughout their lives."
2,Definitely has taste,"I recently had weight loss surgery and couldn't stand the ready-to-drink protein shakes they wanted me to have, so I asked about protein powder to make my own drinks and they recommened whey protein. I bought Any Whey's ""virtually tasteless"" powder and much to my disappointment found it does in fact have a strong aroma and taste. The first time I tried it I added it to juice and couldn't stomach the stuff. I then tried milk, soup, yogurt and many others, but it always added a taste. When added to just water, I was able to pinpoint the flavor. It tastes like liquid graham crackers. I normally love graham crackers, but I don't want everything I drink to be tainted the sweet taste. I'm on to try the next ""tasteless"" powder to see if it is any better. Overall not worth the cost. If possible, order a small size to be sure you like the powder before buying a whole 2.7 pounds. My mistake!"
5,2000's GreaTesT HiP hoP AlbuM!,"This is 2000's greatest album by far.Common's lyrics are great,the beats are fantabulous, and the guests on this album make it a true hip hop classic.My recommendation is go out and get this album."
5,Common is Back - Dropping the Best Hip Hop Joint of 2000,"Like a stream of liquid diamonds, Common flows and shines and cuts and proves that he's Rakim's rightful successor. Hope he gets the backing, marketing and promotion he deserves, cuz kids need to be absorbing these rhymes and beats to beat the streets. No pretense. Just funky knowledge. Some special guests are sprinkled throughout, adding spice. Like the joint with D'Angelo. PICK UP THIS CD NOW BEFORE YOU DIE OF STARVATION. Common proves again that he is anything but common."
4,common does it again,Eventhough this cd isnt as good as his old ones he still shows how he is 1 of the best rappers ever
4,"Famous and not-so-famous rhymes, many uniquely American.","A very nice collection of rhymes for children, most of which are uniquely American. This is not only a nice little book for children and for the serious student of children literature (it won the 1946 Caldecott Medal for best illustration in a book for children), it is also a source of Americana."
2,not a great book,"I bought this book as a present for my niece, thinking it would be a great book seeing how it was a medal winner. It was OK. Some of the rhymes were the obvious ones you would expect. But there were so many me and my husband had never ever heard of. Kind of odd. I dont think her mother will ever read it to her. Owell..."
2,The Rooster Crows,"This book is a collection of American Rhymes and Jingles from all the ages. It was written 1966, but many of the ryhmes in it are still around today. Some examples are How Much Wood Could a Woodchuck Chuck, Mary had a Little Lamb, This Little Pig, and Star Light Star Bright. This book is very well illustrated, compared to other books of this time period."
3,Mastering and Using Microsoft Word 2002,"This is not an easy book to use. Physically it is too big for a paperback, going limp in the reader's hands and making turning pages without tearing them difficult.As far as content is concerned, I didn't find it user-friendly. It is strictly a textbook with exercises and assignments. These may be helpful in the classroom, but for the home user they are pretty much a waste of space. Doubtless most of what I want to know is in here somewhere, but the index is not sufficiently comprehensive, and the many pages of exercises get in the way of efficient use and make it impossible to browse.I had hoped for something rather less textbookish. This is strictly for someone who wants to learn a completely unfamiliar software program from the very beginning in an organized step-by-step way, not for someone who simply needs to look up a specific topic."
3,"good, not great","I voted 3 stars, but really feel that it's a 3.5 I have mixed feelings about this book. I loved some of the characters, but I didn't necessarily love the writing, if that makes any sense. I found them to be funny caricatures, not relatable people. The people who most intrigued me (like Gregory) weren't heard from much. Also, there was some awkwardness in forcing ""moral of the story"" type passages into the plot. I found myself laughing at certain points, and scratching my head at others. I will say this: I intend to read the sequel, but I also don't expect much. My overall impression is that the premise is cute, but it could have been done better in the hands of a more competent writer."
2,Meandering and juvenile,"Maybe this is one of those books that can only be enjoyed by young adult readers. No longer fitting that category, perhaps I just couldn't relate to a light-hearted tale about nothing of substance.On the plus side, this book contains no gratuitous sex or four-letter words. I can appreciate that. But, try as I might, I couldn't bring myself to appreciate the air-headed protagonist, her ditzy, controlling mother or, really, anyone else in the book. The entire novel felt like attending a dinner party only to end up stuck next to a guest who rattles on all night about the soporific irrelevant. Others praised it, but to me, the humor felt strained--as if, page after page, the author was trying way too hard to be clever. (And what was it with the shameless plugs for the author's musician/husband?)May be just the kind of book a career pageant-chick would find scintillating. But it did nothing for me."
5,pop music classics,"Jay & The Americans - Greatest Hits is an excellent CD. The sound quality is excellent, and I enjoy each of the songs that have been included. They really are their greatest hits. I highly recommend this CD to anyone who is a fan of Jay and/or Jay and the Americans as a group."
3,Spanish no habla,should have noticed that it was in Spanish but didn't. So I have no idea what it reads like...
4,Truly,This is one of her older books and I like any book that she writes. This arrived in good shape and when you promised.
2,Old Bugs Character,These cartoons feature the old version of bugs bunny from the 1940s.I gave it 2 stars since I don't like this incarnation of Bugs.Plus the tape is in LP mode.I don't know exactly when they transformed Bugs into the more familiar version which to me was his best incarnation. Probably in the 1950s sometime.Jeff Marzano
5,nice job,i am very satisfied with your product i am happy and would gladly order from you again sorry for this late review
1,Cats & Dogs,"This movie did not live up to its hype, and parts were just plain nasty. An occasional chuckle did not make it worth the ticket price. Save your money!"
1,This is the worst movie EVER!,"This movie,in words,is TERRIBLE! It focuses on dogs like they are the saviors of humanity and cats are terrible,wicked,mean,cruel and evil. The only three words that dogs rely on to survive as heros in this movie is MAN'S BEST FRIEND. I have five cats and NO DOGS AT ALL and this film promotes what I call 'cat racism'. A friend who makes cat comics has told me that dog people are jealous of cat people so they make stuff like this to 'get even'. I don't recommend this piece of trash to anyone,even dog people because the beagle gets pushed around and thrown in different ways. So do the cats. This is the usual garbage that WB makes,so I would recommend cat lovers toss this aside and get WB's better work,Cats Don't Dance,or dog lovers to get Shiloh,My Dog Skip(touching) or the classic,Old Yeller."
3,okay..,"great show... i think the earlier seasons were better, but its still a great watch..no issues with playno issues with purchaseno issues at all!"
4,No center channel,"Played this disk last night (11-4) and no center channel, nada, zip, nothing, in DTS 5.1.Confirmed system is ok with another disk.PCM sounds better,more punch, but would like to have DTS 5.1Anyone else having issues?Great performance otherwise. I am a fan of their 1st 2 albums only, others went too pop'ish for me.Liked all the tunes from 1st album here (soooo much better than concert with Earth Wind Fire).Only I'm a Man sounded weak, guitar buried too deep in the mix, lost it's edge compared to original recording.I know, it's not the same guitarist, it's just a poor mix for that song.Otherwise this is the best sounding & looking performance I know of Chicago."
4,Beautiful ring,"When the ring came I was very impressed, it looks even better in person than in the picture. Sadly, it was too big and had to be returned, but it would have been loved if it had been the right size."
5,An excellent portrayal of life as I know it...,"The author speakes to me in a way that many other authors miss. Makes Me Wanna Hollar, is grit and ""real"" causing the reading to think in ways other times often missed."
4,The stress of survival,"Nathan McCall's acoounts of his life are inspiring and terrifyingall at once. He proves that not all, supposed, ""bad"" kidscome from disfunctional homes. His parents were loving andsupportive, yet he still found it easier to take another route.His telling of his treatment in different work environmentsbrought to mind different incidences I have encountered, andhow sad and dissapointed our society can make us fell. Iapplaud him for a book I couldn't put down, even when I tried.I just had to keep reading."
5,Powerful!!!!!!!,"Brother Nathan and I are about the same age. I am an African-American woman who has been humiliated by the reckless behaviors of males such as Brother Nathan in his youth. I still carry the scars and found it difficult to get through the beginning of his book. I had to keep going back to the cover and telling myself that he must have turned his life around since he put his photo on the cover. I was relieved to watch him turn his life around. I ended up feeling very pround to have him in the African-American family. I have recommended the book to many. Thanks, Brother Nathan !!!!!!!!!"
2,Makes me wanna holler/ Makes me wanna holla,"Growing up in the hood can be difficult, especially for Nathan McCall. He's seen and done it all from gang beatings, to murder, robbery, and rape, but he can only keep his head above the water for only so long. He gets arrested and becomes a rehabilitated man as where he writes his own novel in prison, which is the very same exact book that you probably have in your hand. This book is a fantastic one which describes many of todays problems with gangs and bad neighborhoods such as the one in the book. I give it and A+, ahmen!"
4,A bit before my time...,"Having been born 10 years after the time setting of this novel, I can't comment as to whether or not it accurately portrays the general mind-set of that year. However, I do think that this is the sort of novel that people of my generation should read, since we are too young to have experienced the horror of a real war, besides in the often-glorifying portrayals of the movies. Above all else, I feel that Haldeman managed to communicate vividly how war changes the lives of everyone involved, and how in the end, there are no winners. I hope my generation won't have to learn that lesson the hard way."
1,VHS does not work!,"I have been unable to view ""Ten from Your Show of Shows"" because it will not play on any VHS player I have tried. What do I do? I did not keep the mailer envelope or I would send it back. I will see if it is in my email."
3,A durability disaster,"NAturally in all sea-monkey tanks, water evaporates which you later replace but anyway that evaporation causes metal screws in the lid to rust. the rust then gets in the tank and is a harmful toxin to the sea-monkeys fragile eco-system. If you want a toy that is Great eduactional and good for all involved buy a nice sea-monkey kit with either a classic design or on with no metal."
1,Please help!!,"first of all it didn't come with any of the cabels that are shown in the picture, though this is not the product's fault as i bought this used. what bothers me is that i can't find any codes online that fit when i try to put them in manually. is there anyone who has a link to a website with codes specific to this gameshark, otherwise, this sucks!!!!"
1,Worst Investment Ever!,"Please do not buy this product. It simply does NOT work. You can't enter new codes, download, or upgrade. Period. You actually can't even start the game once you put in codes so it's pointless and annoying. Don't even bother wasting your money. It just isn't worth the frustration."
2,WHAT!!!!!!!,This was a gift from heaven for about 4 years i used it all the time. Then it corrupted my data. It was sorta my fault tho. Then it just broke down on me i didn't know y. I cleaned it and everything it never worked again.
1,Tiresome,Tiresome storyline. It gets old reading a book whose story revolves around sex. A poor excuse for not being able to write a book.
4,A good start to an excellent series,"A Kiss of Shadows was the first book I read by Laurell Hamilton. She had already written the first 2 and the 3 one was due out. I read all three and while waiting for 4 I began her Anita Blake series. I disagree with the reviewer who said that all the men in the Merry series were alike, but there are similarities between the two series. Also let it be known that Ms. Hamilton herself has said that she is still finding her way with Merry. That said, I enjoy BOTH series (putting me in the minority) and recommend them to anyone who enjoys adult fiction."
5,Great,Product arrived in a timely fashion and in great shape!Really enjoyeable purchasing experience.
3,So-So,"This Laurell Hamilton was a little too much for me. Chapter 31 was a gross out. It was interesting and non-stop action, but, altho I am very impressed with LH's imagination, I think I'll wait until Merry's next adventure comes out in paperback."
1,What do you want?,"If you want a soft (or not-so-soft) porn adventure story with lots of abs and mouths then go for it. The author writes fairly well, but the plot is repetitious. The heroine can't touch a man (and she touches many, many men) without having an orgasm. In the next book, lucky her, she must bed 27 men who are forced celibates, some of whom haven't had sex in 1000 years. If the thought of this turns you on...."
1,This was NOT worth the wait !!!,"I LOVE the Anita Blake series- Kiss of Shadows, however, is a bad blend of that series and Anne Rice's pseudo-erotica Sleeping Beauty series with the faerie court thrown in. Meredith comes across as a dog in heat, and the other characters are just dull. Hopefully Laurell's next book will be a more enjoyable read!"
3,"LKH needs an editor, stat!","This isnt the worst book I've ever read (that would have been Fellowship of the Ring), and no the sex didnt bother me. What drove me insane is that most of the book is written in sentence fragments, full of paragraphs that had no logical placement or structure, and full of sentences that began with conjunctions. Had this been a short story written in junior high I could maybe understand the mistakes, but I certainly wasn't expecting this from an author with so many published works."
5,Erotic romp through LA and Faerie,"While I was prepared to be disappointed with the shift away from the Anita Blake series, I must say that my husband had to DRAG me to bed at 2:30 in the morning. Laurell has created a definately surreal, erotic storyline in this new series. She takes a no-holds-barred approach to her descriptions of the Unseelie Court and what the politics of an ancient, sometimes amoral people can be like - something Merry wants away from desperately. While this book may look to be straight out of a fairytale - this is NOT a book for children. Prepare to be shocked, amused and sympathetic to Merry Gentry. Sometimes staying alive can be the greatest challenge and the greatest fun! This was one of the few books that I could not put down and wanted more pages when I reached the end. Hopefully, the next installment in this series will be available soon."
3,"Merry and the gang are great, but the plot...","...is a different story(pun intended).CHARACTERS- 9/10. Frost was just cool.(pun unintended) Doyle and the other characters are fascinating. No problems there.DESCRIPTION- 10/10. Very nicely described. The scenes are powerfully written.PLOT- 4/10. What plot? Cel was not too interesting a villian. Could be cos' he was only onscreen for about 5% of the book. The plot left me feeling like this book was just the prologue, setting the stage, if you will."
3,OK - not a page turner,"I was intrigued by the concept, but found the book came up a little short. It was mildly entertaining. There really was no plot until somewhere past the middle of the book, when our heroine finally returns to Faerie. Before that, it seems to be all sex and action. I probably won't read any more in the series, but then again, I did read the book and not just quit halfway through it.My star ratings:One star - couldn't finish the bookTwo stars - read the book, but did a lot of skipping or scanning. Wouldn't add the book to my permanent collection or search out other books by the authorThree stars - enjoyable read. Wouldn't add the book to my permanent collection. Would judge other books by the author individually.Four stars - Liked the book. Would keep the book or would look for others by the same author.Five start - One of my all time favorites. Will get a copy in hardback to keep and will actively search out others by the same author."
2,This is a bodice-ripper,"Hamilton does love to write about sex.Throughout the Anita Blake books, she has used a lot of sexual tension, and Anita uses sex as a weapon. Fine. There has been plenty going on to carry it.But this one!I don't read ""Romance"" novels because I get bored with plot-lines that have little to offer beyond sex. And that's all this was. There were maybe fifty pages of actual action involved. The set-up was interesting; we have a princess in hiding, and her relatives are her most dangerous enemies. OOH! What a premise! But nothing happens!Our heroine does maybe four things in the entire novel. Beyond that, we have lots and lots and lots of sex. This was a yawner. I guess I'm just not enough of a voyeur to enjoy it.Don't buy this in hard bound. If you decide to buy it at all, school yourself to patience, because there isn't much plot here."
2,Too pointy and doesn't stay put,"I was so excited to get these shoes to wear in a wedding, but I had to return them! The toe was way too big and too pointy. Plus there is not enough shoe to hold on the foot. I thought, a night of dancing and walking at a wedding, it is not going to work. I think if you have very narrow and pointy feet, then these will work for you, but if not, don't waste your time..."
2,It started out fine,"This was a great little system - compact, great sound, easy to use. Then, one day, without warning, it just stopped working. I tried a number of things including changing the remote battery, but to no avail. I really need something I can rely on to work for more than 6 months."
3,Almost useless,"The author tries so hard not to offend anybody, that she puts too positive spin on every possibly negative interpretation and overemphasizes what would already be considered as a positive one. Also, I found the most interpretations just inaccurate. Examples from nose chapter:short nose - workaholiclong nose - talent for planning and strategystraight nose - you work systematicallyarched nose - creativity...Ok, of course you are supposed to interpret everything and put it all together, eliminating contradictions on the way, but the book falls short on instructions how to do that. There should be a chapter titled ""putting it together"" where the author should explain the process of face reading: what to look first? how to determine basic information about a person and go from there? Instead the book focuses on details without giving you the big picture."
1,Full of gems for both Tabloid readers and Intellectuals.,"I'll let it speak for itself:""...unibrows, they go with nonstop thinking... Insomnia may be a problem. Therefore, a unibrow is one physical face trait I recommend changing. Tweeze. Try electrolysis.""""I challenge you. Search any organization. Regardless of job title, social lineage, or pay scale, the ones who work hardest, day in and day out, are the ones with the shortest noses.""""...people with overbites... They're eager, sometimes overeager to please--at least unless they spend years retraining and restraining this impulse through orthodontia.""""Rosetree"" is a clever lady."
5,Good beginner book,"If you are going to build you own adobe home, this is a great book for the first time adobe builder.Had details on all aspects of the house. From electrical to pouring bricks to septic. Details as in the formula for a perk test, and footing sizes for load weights.I have a lot of adobe books, this is second ""good"" one I have seen.Very good."
5,Wow... I love it!,"I bought this particular zester because a reviewer mentioned grating frozen ginger, and that's exactly what I needed it for. Since then I have done zesting, frozen ginger (over and over again, and it grates it like it's nothing!), even cheese, and it cleans up afterwards like a dream. It was such a must-have that I bought one for my envious mom! I've even put it in the dishwasher, (but I'm not sure if I'm supposed to!)"
4,overall excellent,"pros- i find it very sharp and efficient. zest comes off quickly without the pith! grates nutmeg superbly.cons- it does have a slight issue with the balance due to the lightweight handle, and retrieving zest stuck to the back side is a little cumbersome due to the design (both of these have been mentioned by previous reviewers, but are noteworthy)i do recommend this. great grater for super cheap."
3,Great....except for ONE little thing.,"This book was quite cute and my 5 year old giggled at the end. The ONLY problem I had with it was the use of the word ""hate"" a couple of times. I easily edited it out when reading but as soon as she starts reading she will notice it. I just don't care for that word and we don't allow it in our home. I am contemplating returning the book based that alone. Other than that it's a super cute book. If you don't mind your kids hearing that word and/or using it, it's a great choice. I just don't EVER want my kids to think it's okay to say they hate their new school, fear can be illustrated without that ugly word."
4,One Drawback,The sound quality is quite good and ease of use appreciated. The one drawback I found is that even at the lowest volume level it is still a bit too loud to use as background music in a social gathering situation.
4,Pefect for your desk.,"I use this on my desk at work. It's perfect for keeping my iphone charged and listening to my music while I work. It takes up little space and the sound is good. I received it fast and set up was simple, I would recommend this dock station/speaker to everyone."
2,"Nice idea, but doesn't work if your iDevice has a case on it","I wanted a small speaker/recharging station for my iPhone and this looked like the perfect solution, but I was disappointed to discover that the iPhone doesn't fit down on it when the case is on the phone. It's not an easy case to remove, so taking the phone out of the case each night isn't going to be practical."
2,Disappointed,"I loved the size of it and it was easy to operate. The sound was good and what I expected from such a small device. I really liked it except for the fact that it didn't charge the iPod.When I hooked it up, the iPod battery blinked (like it was charging) for the first 5 minutes, then it would stop. I left it docked for over 10hrs and still it didn't charge.Satechi replaced it for me and the 2nd one they sent had the same issue. I sent it back and they refunded my money.If you don't need it to charge your iPod, I'd highly recommend it."
4,"Sounds good, easy to use","I'm very happy with this product. The sound gets a little distorted at high volumes, but I bought it to use quietly at my desk, so it's not a concern for me. It has a small footprint which works great for me and the remote control is very handy."
1,Poor Quality,"This ipod player came with a remote that didn't work. They sent me another one and after 6 weeks the second remote stopped working and my ipod player is making ""static"" noises. The ipod doesn't sit in the dock securely and doesn't play music or charge unless you place something behind it to secure it."
1,Worked for almost a full day,"Sounded good. Looked good. But on day two, it wouldn't play and also wouldn't charge my I pad.Also, the I Pad is pretty wobbly because the support in back is really sized for an I phone, not an I pad"
3,"Very average, maybe less than. . .","I love any storyline of dolls coming to life - every since I was about 6 and my mother would keep me up to watch the twilight zone, one step beyond, etc. They always had some doll or manikin coming to life - this one, is a little slow and boring - the doll's just aren't all that well animated. It's okay - I won't watch it again - the storyline had more potential than the actual film showed."
5,I miss it,I loved playing this game. It's to bad there is no way to get it to work on Windows 7. I hope they make an update or at least put this on steam would be nice.
2,A Disappointment,"Perhaps I wasn't careful enough in selected this book. I expected at least some part of it to contain the story so I could read it to my granddaughter. Instead, it seemed to be promotional material for the movie."
4,I love some of the songs.,I love this cd. some of the songs are nice. I use fileshareing for my music. I don't like to pay. It's a wonder anyone pays for songs anymore.
5,Written by a pilot's pilot,"Lou Martin shares a rare view of living in a trouble land as a commercial aviator. Each chapter is a story in itself, while revealing the larger picture of life in Iran during that country's best and worst of times. Mr. Martin is a natural story teller and gifted writer. His story zeros in on the day-to-day problems and pleasures he encountered in Iran, and puts them into perspective by giving the larger picture of Iran's internal and world politics."
1,HORRIBLE MOVIE,"I was forced to go see this god-awful movie with my girlfriend, and it was a total waste of time. This movie dragged on forever, and it had the worst storyline ever created. The acting is so poor that I was laughing during some scenes. When the movie was over, I heard people in the theater saying things like ""Well that was the worst movie I've ever seen."" and ""What a crappy movie. I want my money back!""Avoid this movie at ALL costs. Don't even watch it if someone rents it for you. You have better things to do with your time."
3,Leaves too many unanswered questions,"Generally speaking, I usually enjoy films with open endings that leaves the viewer to come to their own conclusions and interpretations of how the story ended. But, in Solaris, (not comparing it to its previous source materials) the ending just left too many unanswered questions making this movie ultimately a letdown. Many movies that have open endings leave you puzzled but still satisfied with the feature. The way Solaris ended, I kind of felt teased and ripped-off in a way. Besides the way the film ended, I did like Clooney's performance as well as the co-stars' preformance in the movie. The story is pretty dramatic, emotional and intriguing. So overall, the film isn't bad, but just kind of feels like a teaser with the way it ends."
1,Recipe for Disaster,"This is the formula that was used to create this movie.Start with Tarkovsky's 1972 version of Lem's novel and do the following1) Strip it of all its mystery, creepiness, and hazy imagery, replacing that with Hollywood-style psychobabble and expensive sets.2) Cast George Clooney in a role far beyond the scope of his acting abilities (thanks for the shot of his muscular ass, by the way).3) Remove the seldom-seen and seldom-heard basketcase crew members that haunted and confused Kelvin in the book and original movie, and replace a) the pilot with a slacker moron who behaves like a David Spade character and replace b) the mad physics genius with (of course) a black woman actress. A little bit for the PC crowd and a little bit for the teenagers to laugh at.4) Lots of flashbacks of George Clooney dressed smartly in his pseudo-James Bond milieu.What a piece of trash this film is. It is about half as long as the original by Tarkovsky, but it seems to be twice as long."
3,not even close,"This doesnt come close to the book. There is no reason what so ever to change a thing from it. If you never read the book, the movie is decent but just has that, ""trying to make something deep"" feel to it. Theres never that climax that you felt reading the book."
1,YAAAWWNNN!!! zzzzzzzz....,What a waste of time and money this movie was!George a word of advice:Your mostly middle aged white female fanbase wants to be charmed by your smile...not scratch their bobbed-haircut heads in perplexity watching you brood and meander through a dark and dismal flick which doesn't make much sense to begin with.
4,Whoah,"This movie is a great mind trip...and complete freak out. There is a lot going on in this movie, while also being easy to follow."
5,Nice DVD,"Movie was sent swiftly and plays perfectly. Words, words, words, words, words, words, words, words, words, words, and words.Thanks!"
2,Quite dull,"I couldn't get through this. It's an interesting sci-fi concept movie, but the tale is just not told fast enough, I guess. I got sick of flashbacks to George Clooney's idyllic married life with the clone who haunts him on a spaceship off the planet Solaris. The soundtrack is nicely atmospheric and the photography is great. Just doesn't cut it as a night's viewing pleasure."
3,SO-LA-TI -DOH!!!,"Well, despite superstars, super-directors, and super-producers, this remake of the Soviet Masterpiece attempting to solve Kubrick's ""2001"" conundrum - still clunks along. Great performances though from Mr. Clooney and the rest, with superlative Costume and Setdesign - but leaves you empty ......Now if only ""The Plague of the Remakes"" would subside, and Tinseltown would concentrate on originality instead of reinvention .......This version pales by comparison to the original Masterpiece - and what's with this continuous 'homage ala Kubrick'?Let the poor genius rest!"
1,thumbs down,">As you can see, it's easy to find faults with this film. What's harder is expressing what's so great about [it].Three guesses why that is."
2,A Resounding Dud,"Much ado about nothing: this sci fi movie is a tiresome, pretentious, vacuous, longwinded bore. It strives for a transcendent, even apocalyptic note, but winds up being just plain silly. George Clooney struggles manfully to breathe some life into this stillborn turkey, but it's more than mortal actor can do. Natascha McElhone (who?) is the forgettable romantic interest, and Jeremy Davies as a crew member is such a mannered ham you long to make him sit on his hands. At 99 minutes this is not a long movie, but it's a lot longer than it ought to be, if you catch my drift. Do yourself a favor and save your time and money; I wish I had. I venture to predict that if this dud is remembered at all, it will be recalled as the movie in which George Clooney unveiled his bare ass. Maybe he was trying to tell us something."
5,The best source for Algebra I worksheets!,"This series easily contains the best algebra one worksheets I've ever come across. They cover absolutely every concept in the first year algebra textbooks (although not necessarily in the same order, which is why it's really important to get each of the 4 books). They provide wonderful practice for students struggling with algebra for several reasons. 1) They begin each section by grouping problems by solving technique, so that the student experiences the same method repetitively. The later pages in a section mix the problems so that the students must decide which technique to use. 2) The quantity of exercises alone is really helpful -- for students for whom repetition is the key, the number of easy to ""intermediate"" exercises provides enough practice to help the material ""stick"" with the students."
2,Maybe this is a spoiler,The book is well paced at first and by half of it it starts to bore you. You'll never have a clue or even an inkling of which one is the bad guy. The plot goes in and out of psychotic thinking that will digress you off the main story so... if you read it don't expect a great thriller or a good love story. There's none of that in this book.
1,Mac OSX 10.4 No Go,My G5 can see the UPS as attached through the USB port but the downloaded software will not recognize the UPS unit. Had to send it back because it is functioning only as an expensive surge protector.
3,Where's the index?,"This is a slick paper, well labeled map that shows both physical features and political divisions. It covers from Hamburg, Germany in the Northwest to Rangoon, Myanmar in the Southeast; and from Sri Lanka to northern Kazakstan.That's the good news. The bad news is: there is no index of cities! A map that covers that extent of land and countries without an index is of limited use. Why didn't their Product Description include this 'little' detail?"
2,"Looks good, but the battery life is terrible",This would have been a fantastic phone save for 2 defects:1. The battery only last a day or less.2. You make unintentional calls when the phone slides open in the case or in your bag (which also helps drain the weak battery). I finally found how to lock the key pad which requires a 5 digit code to open.
5,A MUST SEE FOR ZOMBIE FANS,"This Movie was Excellent. It's like 28 days later Meets, Resident Evil, meets Dawn of the Dead....In Fact i enjoyed it more Than 28 Days Later? It's been along time since i enjoyed a good zombie movie until this Devil's Playground. This Film is worth every Penny.... for the die hard Zombie Fan.... I like the fact that they take their time with it,and explain how the Virus originated from...and takes us to the streets to see the chaos unfold... Very well written and Acted....Thumbs up to this one.... It should have had a wideworld Release........Don't miss out..."
3,Not too bad,"This movie was actually not bad. It takes itself seriously and is fairly interesting with decent special effects and acting. The biggest problem I have here is with the infected themselves. They are fast-moving creatures in the vein of ""28 Days Later"" but they also jump, spin, and roll around like a bunch of demented monkeys. It is supposed to be frightening but it really comes across as silly seeing zombies/infected jumping around like baboons on crack. Also the don't seem to have any consistancy on what kills the zombies and how they die. Sometimes the zombies seem to be killed quite easily, while other times they appear almost impossible to kill. Occasionally the British accents get a little hard to follow but that is a minor inconvenience. Overall an enjoyable film."
4,great movie,"It looks great and will is going to make for a great gift, thanks again and have a great day"
1,Sucked,Seen this **** before but it's now done in a dry english manner.I wasted four bucks on this junk.
4,FINALLY!,"Finally, Super Fly is on DVD. The wait has been agonizing, but now it's finally here. My only problem with it is that Warner Bros.-- again --used the Super Cheesy cardboard DVD snap case instead of the plastic ones that everybody else uses now. That minor flaw aside, this is a great movie that should've been on DVD years ago."
1,Not for loose coffee grounds!!,"I bought this to brew loose coffee grounds, and I wound up with a cup full of grounds and a very messy machine to clean up even though I hadn't filled the basket too full. This might work for pods or tea bags, but I sure wouldn't recommend putting anything loose in it!"
3,Good and bad,"When it works properly I love it, but often it stops pumping the water and just send puffs of steam that burn you while you are trying to figure out what the problem is. If it worked as it should all the time I would give it 5 stars easily."
2,Loved it at first,"When I first got this it worked great, but soon it started leaking all over the counter, popping, steaming, not brewing a full cup. I de-scaled it like recommended and cleaned it all up but it still keeps doing it. Love the concept, not this design."
1,Great idea - bad engineering,"The first one of these we had was great! My wife made her tea and I made my coffee with it, and it produced excellent results. That lasted for about 5 months. Then it started to just pop and steam without pumping any water. Thinking it needed descaling, I tried that - - several times to no avail. So I finally called Hamilton Beach customer support, and at their direction sent in the cut off plug of my broken unit and $6.95 s/h. After several weeks, I received the replacement unit. It worked exactly one time before the spitting and steaming took over. I called H-B again, and this time they shipped a replacement unit immediately at no cost. It worked for exactly 2 cups before the exact same problem. Obviously there is a major flaw in the design of the water heating/pumping. Wish it worked!!!"
4,Cute...fun,"Only two bad things...#1 when it's done brewing..it kicks off immediately..doesn't keep the coffee warm..#2 if you use a standard coffee mug..it gets soooo hot to the touch..cause it brews right into the cup..you can't even touch the cup for a while..I might start brewing in one cup, then pour into another to drink?Cute, fun overall. I like! Never thought I would enjoy a single cup pot..but I received as a gift from dear clueless hubby (LOL)so I thought I would give it a try & I like it!"
2,Slow and of poor quality,"I bought this to brew pod coffee .. it brewed very slowly but did make 'decent' coffee .. that is, until it died after only a few months of use (it was used only a few times per week!) .. save your twenty bucks and invest in something that will save time and last longer. And the top area gets really hot so don't get near it while it's brewing unless you want a second degree burn."
2,"Nice features, but has its flaws...","I purchased this product for my husband after he requested one for Christmas. (He didn't request this particular brand...just a single cup brewer).PROS:It does what it promises...it brews very hot water/coffee for use into a cup.CONS:The handle to remove the filter from the unit is the same 'neck' that is used to dispense the hot liquid into a cup. Therefore, if you remove the filter and accidentally tip it towards you, any remaining scalding liquid dispenses onto your unsuspecting hand. This is an incredible design flaw.This unit makes more popping and moaning than our 10-cup brewer. There is absolutely nothing quiet about this product.Granted, this item is only in day two of use...but as of this writing, I am not a very happy owner."
1,POS product,"I received one of these as a prize for a fundraiser. The product never worked. It made all the sounds that other people experienced and no water came out. Light went off and wouldn't come back on. Had to let it sit longer than the recommended 30 seconds. Not that it mattered, it wouldn't produce anything. Avoid this product like the plague! If I could, I would not give it any stars."
3,"it is not as perfect as lucy pearls cd, but it is a ok cd.","I think that dwayne should have made more sounds that sound like the things he have done with the 3 tony's. He did not put to much effort into it but, some of the sounds were very good. I think he should get back with the 3 t's quickly and do his solo thing later in the mid future, but I still like any of the tonys music with or without eachother together."
3,"Good album, but where's Raphael?","This has the classic sound of the Tony Toni Tone albums that I love. Musically, this is an excellent album, and it does follow the same tracks that have been laid down by previous albums buy this artist. So much so, in fact, that I was really wanting to hear Raphael sing over it. I wish the group hadn't broken up (it's really too bad). Don't get me wrong, it is a good album, and it does do Dwayne the musical justice he has long deserved, but the singing is not there as much(Dwayne's voice was never as good as Raphael's), and that hurts the overall album."
5,Great for Fluency!,This book along with her others are wonderful for emergent readers to gain confidence and fluency. My daughter and I love to read this book together. It is fun because the stories are spin-offs to Mother Goose Tales. I would highly recommend this for any primary (K-3rd grade) child.
5,Perfect for Parents and Grandparents,"We love curling up with our newly reading grandsons (no grand daughters yet) and sharing the reading with them.A terrific concept and implementation, and lots of fun for all of us."
5,"You Read to Me, I'll Read to You: Very Short Stories","This is an excellent book. My 5-year-old son, knowing all the sounds of the letters, was reluctant to try reading words. In part, I think his fear was that if he started reading, I would quit reading to him. This book is wonderful - he is thrilled to be able to read most of the words, and the fact that we do it together shows him that reading will not necessarily be a solitary experience for him. It has increased his confidence dramatically."
4,End of an era,"Rush said goodbye to the sci-fi tales, the ten-minute epics and the complex arrangements for a more commercial, radio friendly sound, with successful results. A change of decade bought a change of approach in their music, with lyrics that the man in the street can relate to, the right to choose (""Free Will""), the communication barrier (""Entre Nous"") and the environment (""Natural Science""). Opener ""Spirit of Radio"" was a hit on this side of the Atlantic, and unbelievably can still be heard on radio today (albeit not very often) Had I reviewed this without hearing ""Moving Pictures"", I would probably have given it 5 stars. ""Pictures"" is in every aspect better than ""Waves"" and is probably the best rock album ever made (check my review), but this record still stands out on its own. Worth purchasing."
2,Maybe if they were an all instrumental band ...,"I think Lifeson and Peart are fine enough musicians in their own right, but I can't really hear them... first, because I can't get past the insipid, pseudo-cosmic lyrics. Add to that the fact that they're sung by what I can only describe as a squirrel on helium. That's far too much to ignore when trying to listen to their music."
3,Good collection of songs.,"Permanent Waves is pretty cool. There's some good material throughout. The direction of Permanent Waves is more straight-ahead than previous releases. The songs are tight and energetic. Geddy Lee does a good job with the vocals. The musicianship is very good as usual. My favorite songs are ""The Spirit of Radio"" and ""Entre Nous."" I especially like the intro to ""Entre Nous."" The rest of the album's material is listenable, too. Permanent Waves isn't a personal favorite, but I still think it's cool."
2,A differnt realm of thinking,Forget about social science. Why do I have cystic fibrosis? Why does she have sickle cell anemia? Why does he have Tay sachs? Therein lies the answer.
4,A Good Starting Point,"This book reads a bit like a reference book and a bit like textbook. Many problems I have when trying to do something I've never done before (i.e. flying) is that I never know where to start. Knowing that I don't know what I don't know can turn me off to a new activity quickly. This book gives a good overview of what kinds of flying are available, what you can expect to spend, where to look for like-minded people in your area, finding mentors to help you, choosing a flight instructor and many other types of knowledge you will need to not only pass ground school, but apply during your check ride. It also tells you what to expect with that, too.Overall a great book to show your ignorance of the subject and how to make yourself smart. I hihghly recommend it for anyone wanting a ""pilot's primer."" If you already know a bit about the flying culture, this book might not be for you but may still have insights you may have overlooked or refresh your knowledge on certain points."
4,Better and better...,"I have been a long time fan of producers Kaidi Tatham and Dego/4hero, so I bought this album. At first I wasn't impressed at all, but the more I listened to this the more I loved it. It's very delicate music, with pretty chords, and the vocalist Deborah Jordan, has a really pure voice to complement. It all sounds simple at first, but you realise that it's actually quite subtle, deep music (although I found some of the lyrics a bit pretentious). If you are into people like Jill Scott and Raphael Saddiq then you will probably like this british take on the neo-soul sound. Just make sure you give it time to digest."
3,typical 21 century quality,"These switches are just Ok, I have been using them for 20 years as replacements for my 100+ year old ones as they Slowly wear out. Although I am now replaceing the classic accent switches as there not the quality of the origianls. Maybe if they were still made in north America they would last longer. All-in-all there better then changing to toggle switches."
5,Paul Wellers best album,"After the contemporary jazzmuzak of Cafe Blue this came as a quite a surprise. Its got punk, rock, funk and some jazz. All the songs are good and Weller sings them with real emotion."
4,"Good, excellent shoes","The color of the triband adidas is not the same as the picture, but the shoes are excellent!"
1,NOT A Horror Movie,"I'm a horror film junkie, & have watched some bad ones in my time, and I'd like to say this is one of them, but it's not, as it's just not a horror at all. I bought it on the premise it'd be spooky & have atmosphere, when all it ended up having was a couple of bangs in the night ! It is the worst excuse for a horror movie I've ever had the displeasure of wasting my precious time on, as well as my hard earned money, neither of which I can get back. If your like me & want to be spooked, don't buy this as it wouldn't even scare my cat !"
2,Slow paced,"I didn't find this film as exciting as some of the other reviewers. The acting was pretty solid. The filming was good. The story was rather dull.One of the major flaws was the obvious wig on Tara Reid. Really?Cloris Leechman was VERY good in her roll, but a sailor mouth.I rented it for free, but I don't think I would pay much more than a dollar or two to see it."
4,Lamp lights the way,"This lamp looks good, is very flexible, and works well where ever I put it. Put a Reveal bulb in it and you have a good alternative to the Ott lamps."
4,Not Bad Country Tribute,"This is a CD of George Strait's songs done by others. They do a good job. Even though this is a tribute, the singers stay pretty close to the original song. This is still some pretty good country music."
2,Why is there no Japanese track?,"One of the huge advantages of the dvd format is multiple audio tracks. Why then, have they not included that for Sailor Moon - which is almost universaly known to have one of the /worst/ english dubs ever.As tempting as this dvd is, and as much as I love Sailor Moon, I will hold out for a bilingual or Japanese only version."
1,Fairly worthless,"I wouldn't waste my money on these again for two reasons:1) They're teeny-tiny. They are no longer than my pinky finger and the two of them together aren't as thick. I was actually concerned that my cats might choke on these. If you have a dog, it could be gone in one gulp so be careful.2) They don't really freeze. They're too small to contain any sort of freezing agent. As for actual usage, you'd get the same effect from sticking any of your cat's existing toys in the freezer."
5,Our male kitty LOVES these things!,He loves these things sooooo much! I'm constantly having to dig them out from under the fridge or stove but it's worth it because he loves them so much!
4,Cat Chew Toy,"I love the look of these, and all the Pet Stages fabric toys. They make such cool looking toys for cats. My cat hardly ever chewed these, though. She mostly batted them around a bit, and then ignored them. She likes toys with longer dangles than these have."
1,"Useless, Cats Ignore Them","I have an adult cat and a kitten and neither one of them cared to even look at the toy for more than 5 seconds. There is no catnip like one of the reviews states. They're tiny and there's is nothing inside that can freeze or get crunchy..it gets cool, not cold, and that coolness lasts about a minute. A very expensive waste of money."
5,Very good ... really.,"Okay, so considering I own five of Trisha Yearwood's albums and am a devoted fan, perhaps I am being a bit partial, but this album is really first rate. For a change, her songs are not predominately about the familiar theme of love gone wrong. The beautiful lyrics are filled with the a feeling for the integrity of life and of battles hard won. There are no side-b fillers on this album. From the achingly lonely 'wild for you baby' to the strong, determined 'I'm still alive', every song on matters. Did anyone see her perform 'some days' at the recent memorial day concert in Washington DC? It was fabulous; it made me understand the song on a different, deeper level. Country fan or not, listen to this album. It's *that* good."
5,What a relief,"This cream is the only thing that would actually moisturize my skin, rather than just coating it. I REALLY wish more stores would carry it and I also wish it were easier to find."
3,"This only goes to ""8""...","Not nearly as good as the original (which goes to 11, by the way!). Its mostly a live show at the Royal Albert Hall with little snippets thrown in between songs. Not a bad follow up to TIST, but don't let it be your first ""Taste of the Tap""."
2,Just to let you know...,"This is clearly not an authorized DVD version of ""The Return of Spinal Tap""; there are numerous typos on the cover, many songs are mistitled (""Sex Bomb Woman""? ""Stonehedge""?), and, most problematic, the audio mix is horrendous. I compared it to my VHS copy, and the audio mix is decidedly different - and much, much worse. The video seems to be fine, however. Still, I find myself wondering why Amazon chooses to sell products like this; it seems it must be illegal somehow, but I really don't know. In any case, before you buy ""The Return of Spinal Tap"" on DVD, know that what you're getting is probably not an authorized release."
2,Very poorly done!!!,"Man was I ever bummed when we watched this!!! It was NOTHING like the VHS copy we rented recently. The sound mix is terrible. You cannot hear ANY of McKean's guitar. Also, there are no subtitles, so unless you have memorized the songs you miss nearly all the humor because the vocals are buried in the mix! DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!"
1,Bad bootleg copy,"First of all, this is NOT an official release. As another reviewer stated, it is a bootleg pirated DVD made by somebody on a home computer.How to start. Linear notes are incorrect, on screen menus are garbage, sound is mono, images are washed out (looks like 2-3 generation VHS dub).Do not buy until an official release is made, I don't understand why Amazon allows this to happen, it is obviously an illegal pirate copy, but they do not seem to care."
4,Beautiful (Remix Album),"As a group, I've been bitterly disappointed with Remix Albums, but, Blondie's is actually pretty good. You can dance to it, or just listen. I would actually recommended for Blondie fans who are open for a ""different approach"" to a few of their songs. The price is right, so go for it!!"
1,BLONDIE REMIX,"Awful waste of time, this cd. Awful. Maybe I'd like it if I was into show tunes and spent my time talking about fashion and boys. Tempted to throw this cd away, but it's not worth soiling my garbage can with this rubbish."
2,They don't make 'em like this anymore....,"In reference to Leonard Maltin's comment, I do get off on hearing June Lockhart swear. The only reason I rented this movie from my local Blockbuster, is because I knew Noah Hathaway stared in it. I am the hugest Noah fan, but the darn troll gets more screen time than he does.This movie is really bad and not a bit scary, but its has a classic 80's feel to it. The fact that they can't make movies this cheesy anymore prevents me from giving it one star. I miss those good old days."
4,the troll review,it was a great movie but the whole thing where torok turns people into seedlings to become trolls is pretty much like what they do in Gremlins 2. If you want to see a good horror movie i suggest something like Creepshow
1,VERY BAD MOVIE HORBILE,THIS MOVIE IS VERY SCARY ITS SVARY THEN MOST MOVIES ITS VERY BAD MOVIE DONT SEE IT YOU DONT WANE FILL YORE MIND WITHE THIS JUNK.
3,Pretty but not sodered,"I love the design of this and it shipped fast! Be careful with the o rings, they are not sodered and it pulled apart with just normal wear several days after purchase. I was lucky and heard it hit the floor. It was also disappointing that the little dangling heart has a giant word CHINA stamped on it (makes it look cheap)."
4,Established 1970,"Any Goose Creek Symphony music deserves no less than three stars. This roots music is one of those types that is difficult to categorize.Country,Bluegrass, Rock and even somewhat alternative. Almost anyone would enjoy it. It can relax you, make you think or just plain get your foot to tappin and your hand to slappin."
3,it is ok,it isnt so bad but i like hearts in ice better.i watch it a little while.and well serana's voice sounds diffrent.my favorite salior scout is salior mini moon but on this show it does not have salior mini moon.
2,Well organized but there is not one tune I would want to play,"I just wanted to review this briefly because I was disappointed and would steer others clear if you care about the tunes you learn to play being good ones. I didn't like a single song on the disc. This might not effect your learning too much, but then again it might. If I love a song, I'm motivated to learn whatever I have to in order to be able to play it. But I thought that every single song on the cd was either a real stinker, or just mediocre at best. Couldn't they have done a little better than that?"
5,You'll be playing songs quickly,"This book utilizes a great concept. The cd that comes with it helps you understand how the songs should sound, which helps guide your practice. I find myself ignoring many of the suggested right hand fingerings because the thumb is used in some areas where it really isn't necessary. The songs are beautiful. This book will have you playing some nices pieces quickly."
2,Not what i expected,Some of the buttons do not work properly. I have to press the select button (the most important one) and the right and down arrow several times before it works. And yes..... i tried it with brand new batteries...
1,rip off,it is terrible. its a rip of the genisis version. you can't play with tails. when you have to deafeat the boss you have no rings. and the graphics is lousy. so don't buy it it's just a waste of money.
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS LOUSY TRASH!,"THIS BOOK IS REALLY DUMB! NOT ONLY IS IT UNREALISTIC, BUT, AS WELL AS ALL THE BOOKS IN THIS SERIES, IT CONTAINS INNAPROPRIATE THINGS. AND FURTHERMORE, ALL THE BOOKS IN THIS SERIES ARE THE SAME."
1,For younger readers,"I was eight years old when I started reading BSC and I LOVED them. Now I am 13 and after being introduced to more realistic authors (Robert Cormier) I realize how lame the books are. I am a thirteen-year-old eighth-grade like the girls in the story, but none of the kids in my grade are AYNTHING like them. They drink. They smoke. They swear. They have sex with their boyfriends. They don't babysit. This book, I think, should be read by the 12-and-under crowd because when I was twelve I loved them. But now? They're just trash."
5,"A good, funny book that anyone can enjoy","'Kristy's Great Idea' was the first book in the Baby-Sitters Club Series that I started reading which was last year, 1996. Ever since then, I had searched for more Baby-Sitters Club, in bookstores and in my school library, and it was then I began to form into a BSC Fan.About this book, anyway, it was excellent and especially funny, with the two dogs, B & P; Karen and Mrs. P./M.D.; Sam's prank calls and the first part, when Kristy had to write the essay on decorum. I have read a lot of BSC books so far, and when I read 'Kristy's Great Idea' all over again, it led me to realize how much the BSC members, their lives, and the BSC itself has changed.D23H again."
1,Horrible!!!!,"This is one of the worst books I ever read!!! It is sooooo unrealistic. Its about four girls who start this Club. Other people are sayiny Its for ten and down, But I'm ony ten a I HATE IT!!! I would throw my copy away but Its the Librays. Never Read It"
1,Things Like This DON'T HAPPEN!!,"Well to be completely honest, I read the book when I was nine. Actually I still have the thing somewhere. But anyway, things like that don't happen. I'm 15 years old, and I'm telling you that there could never be a group of friends like that who have a club like that. I mean I know this is fiction, but it's not even realistic. I mean the author Ann M. Martin has no touch with reality here."
3,Book Review,"I love Ann. M. Martin's books. I have been a long time fan of the baby sitter's club. The first book was not my favorite, but you need to read it before any of the others. Kristy, is one of my favorite charcters. I love to read the adventures the baby sitter's club. They are books you can really get into.Leigh H.M."
3,Renee Shipp,"I recommend the book ""Krisy's Great idea"" because it is a real good book.It is a baby sitter's club book.It is about Stacey's Great idea about the baby sitter's club.Kristy thought of the idea to start the baby sitter's club one day.Then her friends that live in her neighborhood thought it was a real good idea.Then they started making flyers to hang up every where and then they hung them up every where in Stoneybrook's neighborhood. When they started doing the baby sitter's club they had three meetings a week from 5:30-6:30 on Mondays,Tuesdays,and Wednesdays.They had the meetings at Claudia Kishi's house because she was the only one with a phone in her bedroom.They got a whole lot of calls from parents the first day.Since there is a lot of baby sitters every parent is guaranteed a baby sitter every time. Recommandation Statement-I recommend this book because it is a real interesting book."
4,Strong Movie in Mind,There was no time when I was blurred out when I read this book.I loved this book and Ann Martin books. There was no time when I ever went like: I HATE THIS BOOK!I would be crazy if I ever said I don't like the book. Buy it! It's worth it!
3,An album for every belly dancer playlist.,"This is a really nice album for Belly dance and Middle East culture lovers. It cannot miss in every Belly Dancer collection. For all the others it's a great album fro chill out moment, or if you want to relax yourself or do you need a really warm atmosphere!!!!FEDE"
4,Great follow-up,If you loved the original Age of Mythology- this is a great followup!It would be better if the campaign part was a bit longer but it is still a great fresh addition to this game. The addition of the Titans adds a whole new dimension.One can only hope that Microsoft will come out with another expansion with Celtic/Chinese mythology too!
5,Sir Mix-a-lot,"I am a single guy, so I really did not need a mixing bowl of this huge size. I use it to put fruit in to keep on display. Really nothing to be said about this product...it's pretty obvious what you are getting"
5,just what I needed,I broke my pyrex bowl and immediately ordered this one to replace it. It's perfect! :)
1,"Bland, Boring ""Timeless"": jungle as new age for the 90's.","I can't play this album on my CD player any more, i fall asleep whenever it comes on. It's not that ""Timeless"" is soothing me and relaxing me, just boring me. Goldie really gives jungle a bad name as the new age for the 90's. This is the kind of album that rock critics like because they can understand it. ""Oh look this is new and different, yet i can follow it enough, i'd better put it on my best of list."" Ugh. Just about any other drum and bass album you can come across is better, including his followup ""Saturnzreturn,"" which keeps the blandness down to half of the album."
4,Almost there...,"I love how stable this stool is - doesn't slip or slide under my son. The problem I have is that it is about 3"" too short to be useful with our normal height toilet. My son's feet don't reach the stool when he sits down."
2,too small,"This step stool is very small. I intended to buy the larger one, but somehow misread the sizing when I made my order. It is not very sturdy either. I bought this stool for my 16 month old to reach the bathroom sink, and she would tip the stool to the side. I ended up returning the stool and paying the extra money to buy a solid wood sturdy stool."
3,step stool,"After I bought this stool I found some at Ikea for $3.00, They're just as nice except you have no color but white with blue dots on the part you step on."
4,Great but Wish it was just a smidge taller,"Love the color and design. Slip resistant and easy for my 2 year old to carry, but I needed it to be just an inch or so taller for him to reach the light switch and sink. Will put away until he's a little taller."
5,a step up,"My son is just about 4 years old & we've recently purchased this stool & the Baby Bjorn potty seat for him to use the big potty. So far we haven't had any problems with the stool. The grippy rubber is super grippy!It's lightweight yet sturdy. It stands just over 6 inches high, about 13 long & 7 wide. My son has no problems moving it over, putting it in place, stepping up & standing on it. I don't believe this would be a good stool for younger children, but older ones shouldn't have a problem. My son Loves this stool & uses it around the house for all kinds of things."
3,nothing special,"This is fairly small. My 2-year old won't be able to use it for the potty or the sink for quite some time. Also, I thought being BabyBjorn would mean great design, however it is tippy if she stands off-center."
1,Too short!,"This is an incredibly short step stool. My son is 36"" and isn't tall enough to use it to sit on the toilet or to pee while standing up. It is also quite expensive for a simple plastic stepping stool. I bought it since it was so popular/highly rated. I just went out and bought one from the hardware store that works much better."
2,Sturdy but not useful,"Like all Bjorn products, this stool is well-made. However, it is too short to be useful. We have a tall 2.5 year old and the ugly $5 Target version is the one we have to use simply because it's 1-2 inches higher."
3,Good product by not for me,"I have bought only BabyBjorn potty products- the toilet trainer, potty chair & safe step. This is a good product but is too short for my 2 yr old to reach the adult toilet safely. It has a nice non-skid top & bottom & stays put which is great & very important for safety. Maybe it will work in somone else's house, but it is a bad fit for mine."
3,Attractive but a bit short,"Like most baby bjorn products, this is attractive and sturdy. However, for a stool to be used by a young child while washing their hands at the bathroom sink, it's a bit short. I'm sure some people buy it for other uses, but I bought it exclusively for this purpose. Its appearance fits well into the decor of my bathroom. With its help, my three year-old son can barely reach into the sink to wash his hands. If it were a few inches taller, it would be far more useful."
3,Not tall enough,"Its not as ugly as other steps but it is really short, our 2 year old toddler hates it because its not tall enough even for brushing her teeth... anyways its not slipery, its safe... maybe next year... dont buy if your kid is short"
3,"It's durable, but expensive","It's not that tall like I wish it would be, if it's a little higher, I would give it a 4 star. It's sturdy, colorful. Overall, it's a ok product. The shipping takes unexpected 2 weeks, I don't know why, probably because I combined another item to qualify for free shipping ???"
5,super spiffy,"this book was great. im 13 and i enjoyed it, even though its a children's book. everything about block island is true to detail...cept for the part about how many steps there are to the south beach...i think there 183. kathleen captured peter's attitude perfectly in this book...i cant wait to see them again so i can tell kathleen in person how great the book is."
1,This is so not Nina,"I don't understand why she makes such a turn in her music style, from Smack Jack to Sunday Morning I think she should stayed the way she where a punk queen. Nina's vocal range has turned down a lot but it's still a good voice. The annoying song Born To die In Berlin is the only song i like, it's annoying but still gives a good message. I haven't really been so impressed of Nina Hagen's latest work, including her new album, I like it but it's not Nina as we know her. As Nina once said, I'm one of those angels you see flying whit a beautiful voice and a instrument."
5,Cute Cuttlebug Designs,I'm new to embossing techniques for card making. I searched Amazon for some designs that I could learn from. These small embossing flowers are really cute. They are small so I can cut them out and use them as overlays for my cards. I use the cuttlebug designs with my Big Shot embossing machine. Another good purchase from Amazon.com!
5,Wayne Weible's mission has been accomplished.,"My spiritual life began anew after I read Mr. Weible's book The Message 7 years ago. I was thrilled to know he wrote another book on Medjugorie but never thought it would surpass his first. I was wrong! This book is another inspiration to me and can be to any who read it. It is so uplifting to know that the Blessed Mother's message has been heard through people who have been blessed with the opportunity to spread the word. The book itself is so informative and enjoyable and at the same time adds another depth of spirituality to the lives of all who read it. Through God, all things are possible and that has been proven by the continued growth of prayer, fasting and penance that so many people have begun because of the Blessed Mother's request to all of us. I recommend this book to any person who has searched but has never found a higher purpose. I also recommend this book to anyone who already believes!"
3,Breath and the Chakras,"I was very intrigued by a chakra sound recording meditation that uses one of my favorite instruments, the cello. The cello playing is powerful and on some of the tracks very effective. By about the 3rd or 4th track, ie 3rd or 4th chakra it begins to get a bit too distracting and forced especially for meditation purposes. As a piece of musical artistry it is indeed that. But I do not recommend it for meditation."
5,Fantastic movie,Probably the greatest movie cast ever on one set (I know that's a VERY bold statement). It's a terrific movie and is great to watch over and over again. Definitely a necessary investment for your DVD collection.
3,Poor DVD release,"This is not a review over the film, which I can consider to be above average (four stars). What I'm here to moan about is this new Collector's Edition DVD. While delaying this disc Warner Bros. did us all such a wonderful favor and didn't even remaster the transfer! It is for the most part, the very same transfer that is on the previous disc. And over 4 hours of bonus features? I think Mann's commentary probably counts towards 3 hours out of four. Poor release. Worst I've seen from Warner Bros. in quite awhile."
1,did not get this dvd in this order,i am still waiting on this blue ray Heat. It was not included in package. I realy wanted this blue ray. it is ok if you did not charge me for it. I will look in the store for it but if I was charged I will like to receive it . Thank You
3,"Wonderful Movie, wish it had DTS soundtrack","This is an amazing movie. I really don't need to go in to the details, since if you haven't heard about Heat already, you probably never will.What I like to focus on is the audio quality of this movie. This is the first DVD that I purchased for my DVD player. I appreciate the Dolby Digital soundtrack, and it is one of the better ones that I have heard, but I would love to hear this with a DTS soundtrack. I couldn't imagine watching the bank hold-up scene with the expanded range that DTS provides!I would however reccommend this movie, despite it's not having the DTS. It does well with Dolby Digital. And you won't be dissapointed."
5,pacino and de niro what else do you want?,"ok, so two of the best actors meet face to face, but theres more, this film is great. I have no reason to feel that the film should have been shorter. At the end i knew both the characters, i lived with them and they were both great at what they did. To shorten the film would merely fall it short. Appreciate the beauty and intelligence of what happens. Hell, just have fun!"
4,Well-constructed crime flick,"Heat, created by the acclaimed Michael Mann (The Insider), is a great (but long) crime movie about bank robbers and the men who attempt to pursue them in Los Angeles. It is fascinating to see Robert DeNiro and Al Pacino in a movie together, altough strangely you can never see the two mens' faces on the screen at the same time at any point in the movie. Val Kilmer is also effective as the wild yet driven bank robber who cannot settle down with his estranged wife, played by Ashely Judd. However, this movie belongs to Pacino and DeNiro, who play two men obssessed with completing their ulterior motives. DeNiro wants to complete that final heist, and Pacino wants to track DeNiro down. Besides some flat dialogue and a peculiar performance by Jon Voight, this movie was greatly underrated by the critics and public."
4,Feel the L.A. heat........( 4 1/2 stars),"Fully a misunderstood plot by many, and stated as overlong, it was all of the combinations of dramatic interventions and conversations with the husk of a charged crime thriller. Imagine how real life cops/crooks wouild go through this adventure ""real time"". With sequences, like the little girl that Pacino fathers who nearly killed herself, or the torn tendencies of De Niro finding an outside interest that heeds no guns or ""hot info"" and is ashamed of his profession, is interesting. The cast, Pacino and DeNiro are the cake, as well as well-focused-on-the-job Val Kilmer as Chris, Judd as the hurt yet still clinging-to-hope wife, and a strong support of minor roles as well.The gunbattle was so brutal, and surreal, and even though I don't promote gun violence at this level anything ""good"" for life as we know it, it was still a fact of what could happen. The gunpower and gunplay was much more real than most capers out there.Way to go Mann....way to go."
1,Blu-Ray Review - Presentation only,"This transfer is the worst I have seen. The picture looks like a dvd and it lacks all sharpness and ""Pop"" that we have come to expect with most BR discs. The audio is horrendous. Who ever did the audio mastering at the studio should be fired. The dialog is so low it is ridiculous. You are going to sit there with the remote in hand going up and down with the volume throughout the full 3 hours of this movie. IT IS JUST LIKE WATCHING THE DVD! What a disappointment.Amazon really needs to change the ratings with BR discs. They should not be mixing the dvd & BR ratings!"
3,Disappointing,"I am a big fan of Michael Mann. In Manhunter, he took his Miami Vice palette and painted a psychological thriller the equal of some of Hitchcock's work, not in the same style, of course, but with the tension and nuance of the master. Here, he is stuck with phenomenal stars, Pacino and De Niro, and they don't pull off the heist, that is, they don't ""steal the show"" or even work well together. The result is a crime drama that has more glitz than excitement, more form than substance.I didn't care one whit about any character in this film, except Pacino's wife, and I can't figure out why she would stick it out for ten weeks with this guy, let alone ten years.Val Kilmer is the doomed partner of De Niro, and at least he is so [weak] that you have some grudging sympathy for him, but in the end he's just another thief who gets his due.I can't say this is a bad film, just not a particularly good one, especially in light of the resources at Mann's disposal."
2,Boring,"For an action movie it went slowly. Good editing would have improved it; made it move more quickly. It progressed by following the relationships between the characters and their families/friends, rather than following the progression of each character toward definative goal. The characters were real, with normal everyday problems, which take up too much of the movie, slowing it down - a lot."
5,SPECTACULAR BEST GUN SHOTS CRIME MOVIE EVER,"The casts performances, the director, all the production crews and the story are brilliant !!! Robert De Niro's cool face in this movie is really fabulous, Val Kilmer's look by holding M16 shooting strongly against cops is the most attractive part that I fully enjoy viewing numerous times !! What a thrill to have my Dolby 5.1 audio systems producing the real true gun shots sounds with bullets flying everywhere over !"
2,Poor,"Michael Mann's glazed cinematograpy and MTV look worked in ""Miami Vice"", since it was a TV show. But it doesn't work in films (nor did it work for ""The Insider"" nor ""Thief"" nor ""Manhunter"" either). And, aside from the approach made on this movie, the plot itself is pretty patchy. DeNiro gives a good subtle performance, which makes me ask, What happened to Pacino? He is so over-the-top in his acting now! In ""Godfather"" I and II he gave such subtle, understated performances, they were among the best in film history. Now he is gruff and shouts all the time, like he has lost his hearing and thinks he needs to speak louder than he does. There is no nuance whatsoever to this, nor his other latest perfomances. Didn't he watch DeNiro act on this film, and think to tone his own acting down? Apparently not....This movie isn't terrible, but it ain't that great either."
1,"Slow, Unbelievable and not worth purchasing","I bought this DVD based upon comments on Amazon. Pacino and DeNiro put in fine performances in an otherwise slow moving movie. The movie would have received possibly 2 or 3 stars if it weren't for the unbelievable shooting scenes, which I found an insult to a persons intelligence. The plot was reasonable just too slow, and certainly not worth purchasing."
5,One of the best action movies ever,"Often I come away from a movie feeling cheated that they cut the story line to fit into the attention span of an eighth grade viewer, Heat allows the plot and characters to be fully explored. You might have expected to see a little story and one or two significant scenes, instead there is a fully told tale with many memorable incidents. The sound is fantastic, the shoot-out scenes in downtown LA have an audio quality that I had never experienced before. The attention to detail is outstanding. I have waited for this DVD ever since I first saw the movie."
3,WHAT AN EXTENSIVE LIST OF REALLY GREAT ACTORS. GREAT DIRECTOR. SO WHY WAS IT HARD TO STAY AWAKE FOR ABOUT HALF OF THE MOVIE,"Mostly, I was disappointed with the slow pace of much of this movie. Somehow, I feel it had the potential to be really good, BUT IT WASN'T. I was bored through about half of it. It's a cop/robber movie that drifted in and out, sometimes thinking it was a socio drama. The melding of these two genres didn't work. TOO BAD!"
5,Better Late than Never,"How does a 72-year-old lady who usually is reading Angela Thirkell novels decide to watch ""HEAT""? Because I googled Ted Levine who is great on old ""Monk"" episodes and discovered he'd been in this movie. So I got it from the local library and after 2 watchings, commentary and all, decided it was the best movie ever made.I especially enjoy Michael Mann's commentary. I'd always thought a film study class would be interesting and these commentaries make a pretty good substitute.So, tired of waiting for the library copy, I bought my personal copy from Amazon.Getting Pacino and DeNiro in one movie is a plus. After all, they aren't that much younger than me. Ha!"
5,One for the chicks as well as the guys,"This is one of the few thrillers that I just cannot get enough of. I found the editing perfect: seamless but still gritty, a tensely sustained balance between the two sides of the equation, with the subplots expertly woven in and out of the main force of the film. Every time I see it I look for weaknesses or overlong pauses, but the pace is relentless and perfectly timed at every turn. Pacino and De Niro turn in classical performances as you'd expect, and De Niro's line about never getting involved with someone that you can't turn your back on in 5 minutes flat has now become part of many people's relationship vocabulary. This film has cookies for both guys & girls - action, character, intelligence and suspense both in the relationship and political realms. Even the supporting actresses defy typecasting (unlike your typical action heroes' vulnerable & fluffy wives with baby.)"
2,"Not very good, but OK for beginner or kid","Overall I was dissapointed in this camera. The description is not thorough enough. 1.3 Megapixels is for STILL images, and the images are decent but there is no flash so limited when lighting is bad. Video modes are 640x480, 320x240, and 160x120. Probably my biggest dissapointment was that the best video mode, 640x480, only shoots at 8 frames per second, which is very choppy and fuzzy. The other two modes shoot at 15 frames per second, which is a little better but they are small screen sizes. Audio is pretty good. If this was my first digital camera ever I would probably think its ok, but I was looking for an upgrade to the video capabilities of my current digital still camera, and this was not it. I will probably give it to some 10 year old as a gift or to a friend who has never had a digital camera."
4,chosen for death,i think this being the fisrt book is the best beginning and it keeps you wanting to read. The books are so good that i have all of them and i think that kate Flora has made herself a gold mine with the Thea Kozak mysteries as i want to know whats going to happen next with Thea.
3,Cheaper than I expected and the color is misleading,"These chairs are a good buy for the price. They fold up easily and are made from pretty solid materials. However, I was very disappointed to find out that the arms are cheap plastic, not wood, and the color is more of a forest green than the lighter shade in the picture."
3,Interesting versions,"Given that Bob Dylan constantly changes his songs, these arent as out of line as some reviewers have written - and considering what the Beau Brummels did to One Too Many Mornings, these are interesting. Shame the price is so high - might do better is a couple bucks cheaper."
5,A View from the Outside,"Read The Speaking in Tongues Controversy even (or perhaps especially) if you are not a Pentecostal. You will find within its pages a wealth of biblical exposition that will make you think. You will find lucid discussions of theology and hermeneutics. And you will find especially a Christ-like author who is both firm in his convictions and irenic in his arguments. You may remain a classically Reformed cessationist (as I did) after the reading, but your mind and your soul will be healthfully exercised for the effort. Enjoy!David W. Bailey, Ph.D.Pastor - Reformation Baptist Church"
1,worst product ever I purchased online,"worst quality product ever I purchased online, it's max life is only a couple of weeks (edges are very delicate)...I recommend all of you not to buy this product from this seller..."
4,Sony 2 GB Memory Stick PRO Duo (MSX-M2GS) (Retail Package),This product is working well with my camera. I felt it was a bit pricey though. Memory sticks are too pricey in general in comparison with SD memory.
3,Memory stick,"Hey! It's a memory stick! It either works or doesn't work. This one worked, so it's good. Besides, it's the only kind of memory one can use with a Cybershot camera."
5,You'll get what you pay for...,"I recently purchased this memory stick for use with my PSP, and so far I'm very pleased. At first I was a bit weary of the $150 price tag, but now that I own it I have no regrets.Along with my game data, I currently have 365 mp3 music files saved to it, and I still have well over 1GB left. In addition, it was properly formated for the PSP straight out of package.If you're looking for the maximum amount of storage for your PSP and you've got the money, I definitely recommend this memory stick."
2,A lot of bad sectors and damaged pictures,"I guess it was also the sellers fault but the card that I bought has a lot of bad sectors and ruined a lot of pictures. To my bigger misfortune I went to a once in a lifetime long trip throughout Asia-Japan, China, Malaysia and you can just imagine my sadness of the many preciuos photos which got completely destroyed and others being overlayed with two others photos.And after I unloaded most of the photos from the card it got worse and it started damaging 3-4 photos in a row.Be aware from which seller you are buying this product and test it well before using it in a long run."
4,sorry but i want it now,i like to say i am sorry because i told you that i do not want it.and i caused you troble for nothing.sorry and can you give me it back.
5,Question about soundtrack,does the soundtrack include the song that plays when V makes the broadcast all throughout England?
5,Tears to my eyes,"Garrett's work is so beautiful it brings tears to my eyes. Not much else to say except that if you like stringed music (violin, viola, etc.),you need to add this to your collection."
2,"Loved it, but it has a leak after only a couple of months","My 2 yr old girl got this for her birthday. It took her awhile to warm up to it, but once she did, she loved it! Unfortunately, it has developed a couple of leaks which we haven't been able to find yet, and she's (ahem, I'm) not happy as its a good toy in which she gets out her excessive amount of energy. We've only had it for 3 months, and she's been using it moderately/heavily for only about a month or so. I have been very, very careful to not let her wear shoes in it, keep things that might puncture it out, etc, for fear of this exact thing, but its happened anyway... Sigh."
5,SHOPPER,GREAT PRICE. LOADS OF FUN. I WAS TOTALLY EXCITED TO GET THIS GREAT DEAL. THE KIDS WANTED TO SLEEP IN IT. IT IS LARGER THAN EXPECTED BUT THAT WAS NOT A PROBLEM WHEN WE PUT IT OUTSIDE. THE CHILDREN WERE GLEEFUL!
2,Leaks are unfixable...sad because son loved it...,"We have never used this outside - yet we have 2, or more, leaks that we can't seem to fix. It came with one patch, but that didn't work...so we've got it covered with electrical tape, etc, yet air continues to leak out. We inflate it before each use, which is loud and ridiculous, but our son loves to play on it. It's also really big."
5,Jump-o-lene Castle Bouncer,"My grandsons just love to jump, roll and tumble. I was afraid they would get hurt so I bought them this Castle Bouncer. They love it and also use it as their fort. I feel they are safer jumping around inside of this, in lieu of jumping off other things."
2,Great fun...but won't last long.,"My kids (1 year and 3 years) love this thing. They play in it together or with friends almost every day.That said, the bottom chamber popped after about 6 months. It can be inflated in about 30 seconds with an electric pump (a necessity with the Jumpolenes) and will last about 5-6 hours...so not the end of the world.The chamber they jump on popped the other day, after about 8 months. I can inflate it but it only lasts about 1/2 an hour.In all...lots of fun for the short time it lasted."
1,3 holes in less than a month,"I read all the reviews befor I bought this, it doesn't seem anyone else has the same problem I have. We recieved the jump0lene less than a month ago and have been patching it every since. We use it in the house and my 2, and 3 year olds jump on it. We patched the third hole the other day. I would NOT recomend this product to a friend. I feel like I thew my money away. This is NOT a quality product."
3,Got a Tear After 4 Months of Use,"We bought this for our 21 month old for Christmas and he absolutely loved it. It is big, so make sure you have the space for it. It took us awhile to blow it up, the directions weren't very clear, certian chambers needing to be filled up in a certain order, etc. After about four months we got a tear in one of the seams of the cut-outs of the walls. We are in the process of trying to repair it, but don't know how long that will last! We thought it was a great product for the price that we paid, but wish it would have lasted a lot longer. This certianly isn't a toy for an older child, we felt our son was the perfect age and size to play with the castle, between 1 1/2-3yrs. old. Hopefully our patch job will work and he and his friends will be able to enjoy it for a while longer."
3,Disappointed in the workmanship,"I purchased this item and when I recieved it and blew it up with the ""ultra-loud"" pump I bought (that was recommended by this site) I noticed the front of the castle would not fill up. Well over the course of the next day or so...the castle walls started to deflate. Wouldn't you know it, there is a leak in the castle. There has got to be some sort of testing to make sure there is no leak in the the product before selling it. This is very frustrating to have to blow this thing up every other day. I would return it but I live overseas and it is more of a hassle (and a greater expense) to return it. Very disappointed in the workmanship of this product."
3,Deflated,"I purchased this in October for my son's birthday in February. The first time we inflated it, it deflated in 30 minutes. I found at least 3 holes in it. My kids love it, but it is short lived due to it deflating. My suggestion is inflate it when you get it and make sure it is not defective."
4,It is huge!,"I liked this but it is huge. I thought it was a lil smaller than it said. But it is not. It is great for outside, but may not withstand most weathers."
1,buyer beware,"I purchased this toy for my 1 year old and 3 year old for christmas. It lasted for about 1.5 months before getting its FIRST hole. I am now trying to find the 3rd hole in the product. My kids loved it for the 45 days they were actually able to play with it. For the money it cost, I had hoped it would last longer than that. A waste of money."
1,Don't Do It,"I am very unhappy with this camera. I had an Agfa with a swivel lens and when the pixels started missing after 7 or 8 years, I decided to replace it. I searched for another swivel lens and found this one. The images I take with it are almost always burry, no matter which setting I use. I had to return it to Nikon for repair when it stopped functioning (the shutter problem another reviewer described), fortunately (or unfortunately) it was within the year warranty. It is very much a disappointment and for the price, I feel cheated. I wish I could give less than 1 star. Anybody up for a class action lawsuit?"
1,a ghastly mistake,"The detrimental message this sends to our children is that original sources are meaningless, language and intention are futile, and artistry is nonexistent. The subtlety and literary grandeur of Lewis' novel is placed, apparently, at no value in a rewritten version of a movie, which was itself a not-too-close equivalent of the original. I urge everyone to read the classic novel itself: Lewis' writing is not only witty and substantial, but is also simple enough for even the 3, 4, and 5 year old children of my friend to understand."
4,A Person of Substance,"This book can only enrich all of us. Mr Carnegie had not only fantastic insight into what is right and wrong in making business decisions, he also applied his high moral standards to his personal life and choosing friends. His explanation of not accepting a God ruling every single act of every single person and then on top of that send us to eternal hell and damnation if we fail, totally coincides with mine. The book reads very easily although written 100 years ago. It has certainly enriched me.My only criticism is that the photos did not download on Kindle."
5,great action sequences!,Batman and Robin is a great book to grab and read! I did just that! A friend of mine gave it to me to read! Great plotting!
4,Twice as nice,"Maze was an appropriately named band-- difficult to pigeonhole...you couldn't quite find your way to the center of thier influences, as it were. Jazz, smooth pop, funk-rock and traditional R&B blended seamlessly to make for a very appealing sound. With singer/songwriter/producer Frankie Beverly at the helm, Maze released a series of fine albums throughout the 80's. This ""2-fer"" is comprised of Maze's impressive debut plus the equally accomplished follow-up ""Golden Time Of Day"". If you enjoy R&B that's smooth and well-produced but still ""in the pocket"" (closer to an Earth, Wind & Fire/Isley Brothers mid-tempo groove than the sleepy ""MOR&B"" of a Peabo Bryson or Luther Vandross) you will find this collection to be a good introduction to Maze."
3,Average unit,"The problem with the voco-pro Duet II, is the cassette decks. Compared to the rest do the unit, they are cheaply made and do not last too long. Tape speed is inconsistent. I purchased an upper level unit from voco-pro and have been much happier. For the price, the cassettes should be better built and perform better. Volume is good, and CD player functioned ok, but takes a little time to read and load....overall, an "" average"" unit."
2,This Is NOT the real Little Deuce Coupe,This isn't the real Little Deuce Coupe album. Buy the Little Deuce Coupe/All Summer Long twofer and you'll get the real Little Deuce Coupe album and also the great album All Summer Long.
3,2001 Arthur C Clarke,"Over all, the book is in good shape, binding and actual cover. I was a little disappointed that the paper cover has some large tears in it. The book had been listed in ""used, very good"" condition. It doesn't rate quite that. But it finishes my collection of the Space Odyessey series and had a copyright date from around when the movie was released."
4,Comparing Both 2001's,"Comparing the 2001 of the book, 2001 A Space Odyssey to the 2001 we know, you can find major differences. Biggest of all would be the event of September 11, 2001. Reading this book makes you think, ""How could our world be different, if we had or hadn't done something?"" Like most books written about the future it's not accurate but it gives us an interesting idea of where we thought we would be. 2001 starts out easy to read and understand, then glides through the book in this way until the last few chapters. The last few chapters require almost a second read through and a few minutes of thinking to fully understand and enjoy what's going on. I enjoyed the sci-fi aspect of 2001, and the end. I literally couldn't put this book down until I was done."
3,not what I expected,"Great songs, but not the original recordings. Sounds like it was recorded when the artist's were much older and struggling to sing the songs. Also, the background music sounds like it was done in the eighties. Really not what I expected. Ok, but a little disappointing."
2,not for me,"Mrs Pilcher mainly writes about ""girls"" not women. They want the Mrs degree no matter who offers it to them [or they hope will offer]. This is especially true in this book. If that's what you want, fine. If not, avoid it.Instead, look up Dorothy Canfield Fisher's books. Today she's known for her children's book, Understood Betsey, but she wrote many fine books for adults. I especially like The Home Maker. It was written over 85 years ago but raises ideas that are current."
1,Soul Love Ballads,Horrible remake of the original songs. Not one song sounded like the original. Not even sure if they were sung by anyone from the original groups. Very dissapointed in this box set. I would recommend not buying this box set if you are looking for original recordings.
4,I recommend this for anyone who wants to protect their liver from potential damage.,"Jarrow Formulas Milk Thistle (Standardized Silymarin ExtractI use this to protect my liver. I take some prescription medications that have the potential side effect of liver damage, so to prevent this I take Milk thistle. Is it working? I don't know. My liver function are not elevated per blood tests. I guess we'll have to wait for the autopsy to see and I'm not ready fot that, just yet!I recommend this for anyone who wants to protect their liver from potential damage. Always check with your physician to make sure it is copacetic with them.Gunner January, 2013"
3,Works for some evidently not others,"I had heard glowing reports of the effect of milk thistle on gout, even from a friend of ours. Evidently our son must have a very refractory case as he said he noticed no difference in taking large doses of milk thistle over a period of time."
4,A great collection of Irish music,"I enjoy this cd a lot, because it has a lot of Irish songs, sung by the original artists. We all know the standards - Danny Boy, When Irish Eyes Are Smiling - but this cd has so many more."
3,Invicta Men's Pro Diver 9204,"This was a nice watch at a great price. I would like to say that the pictures were somewhat misleading. The watch was great, but the dial around the face was smaller than my other invites watches. That may not seem like a big deal, but it really gives the watch an odd look, almost like a womans watch. All in all the price was adequate for the features and quality of the watch. I prefer the invicta self winding watches to this one."
1,Pride and Prejudice,"I found the early chapters on the Stewart dynasty interesting, but then the Reformation reared its head, and the author's objectivity went out the window. I could take assertions that the Puritans weren't bigoted with a grain of salt ( doubt that the American Indians, Quakers and Catholics would have agreed). What bothered me how the book gradually degenerated into Good Protestans vs. Wicked, Pederastic Catholics."
3,Use for my fax & copy machine,"Seems to be okay, let's see how long it lasts. Copies are dark enough. If my criticism is too short, don't print it."
3,No Secret Here,"As human kind grows, the market, as an indication of the wealth, will be growing. There's no doubt that an upward bias exists in the market. Is this a secret? I did perform a similar test on the TDW idea and Wednesday turns out to be more consistently a winner using normalized data over a long period of time. However, when I broke down the data into yearly periods, most of the years appear very similar regardless of which day it is. Only a couple of years showed big differences. One exception is Friday, it is consistently bad. Even on yearly periods. I guess the book is sort of intriguing but do your homework first."
3,Poorly written sometimes contradictory,"I'm sure Williams has outstanding knowledge to share. However this book is difficult to read, has contradictory statements, and poorly documentmented illustrations. It's not worth price."
5,Allowed for profitable trading system development.,"I am a student of trading and began study three years ago with THE MONEY TREE, the Larry Williams' home study course. It gave me a solid base but NOT a trading system. Using the methods in this new book I have built a system that tests to 79% accuracy with an average profit of $235.00. I will begin trading this system this fall and report back on its success. I found the book highly educational and insightful. I must disagree with the reviews that bash this book, I wonder what their motivation was?"
4,"It was a great movie mix,but the quality of the casing wasn't great","I loved the movie collection. It was all great romantic movies. The casing was tattered, but I didn't matter to be. Great movies are great movies."
3,Entertaining but balls are cheap,"My twins have found the boat fun to climb in and over however all the balls arrived with dents in them. I've tried to get them to pop out to no avail. They are made of flimsy plastic, hence I'll need to get better quality balls. Keep this in mind when purchasing, but still not bad for the price."
2,Works the Way it Should but Gets Stuck Pretty Often,"Greatly improves shortwave reception. Much better than using just the telescoping whip antenna on your shortwave radio. The problem is, it has a habit of getting stuck pretty often when winding the wire back into its case. You'll need to pull all the wire out and start over again. I've never had this problem before with the Sangean ANT-60, a similar retractable antenna that costs a little more but is made with a better rotating mechanism."
1,Huh?,It doesn't contain any installation instructions!?!?! How do I know how to install it? And get it functioning? It needs to have instructions. Please.
3,Kaito Radio Antenna,"I bought this antenna to go with Kaito Pocket-Size PLL Synthesized AM/FM Shortwave Radio, KA11 (GREAT RADIO---BUY IT)I live in a rural area free of high buildings and other things that could affect radio reception. The Kaito AN-03l Radio Antenna, may not work for you. I tried it late at night inside a wooden structured home in a room that can best be described as a ""sun-room"". The radio and the antenna were far removed from any sources of interference such as TV, cordless phones or energy saving lights. The room is mostly windows on the south and west sides. There is no use of steel studs or beams in the home. The antenna was extended along the inside of the windows and did not improve FM-SW reception. Re-winding the antenna is laborious.It may work for you. At less than $12.00, you might want to try it."
4,Good value,"This kit is a good value.The value is found in the kit as a whole and the BIG view through these 2"" eyepieces. The extra cost and weight vs the 1.25"" eyepieces are worth the extra investment and effort to rebalance the scope.A shortcoming is in the fuzzy image near the edge of field. Lens that correct this are considerably more expensive (each lens more costly than this kit).Bottom line: very pleased with my purchase every time I look though these eyepieces."
2,Took forever to finish,The writing was beautiful. Where was the story? I read two other books while reading this one. Did not keep my interest-although I did want to finish just to see if anything exciting happened.
4,The Bookschlepper Recommends,"A pampered young Cuban girl finds herself struggling to survive in a NYC tenement. Hijuelos captures the agony, the pleasures, the battles and the successes as she marries, has children, cleans other people's houses and watches her son and daughter Americanize. This is an immigrant's experience that fully captures the dignity of people who never succeed but never concede defeat. They do it for the children. Not as good as author's The Mambo Kings Play Songs of Love."
4,"""Sanguine Secrets"" is a ""bloody"" good time!","What we have here is a lush and sensual tale following the lives and loves...as well as secrets!...of vampires who are chasing, protecting, and loving each other down through the centuries. While I was confused in a few places due to some scene-skipping without names being mentioned, I did enjoy the fast pace and very descriptive writing. There were elements reminiscent of ""Blade"" as well as ""Interview With The Vampire"" sprinkled throughout the novel and an ending that promises a sequel. The writing is exciting and holds the reader's attention. This is an author we'll definitely be hearing more from!"
3,Kid's size shades,"I did a fair amount of research & narrowed down my choice between the Serengeti Lamone or Velocity. I chose the Lamone due to its titanium parts & the photos show it to be fairly large. I have a large head & normally wear Gargoyles but these Serengeti's are ridicoulously small... these a M (medium) size which is the only size option available. These look like kid size glasses, literally these will fit a 12 year old boy only. I bought a used pair from Amazon warehouse so maybe if you buy a new pair or another site the size is bigger but you really need to have a small face for these to fit. As far as quality very well made and light weight."
3,no feet,"You will want to stand up for most of this one. Alas, it will do no good. The simpletons have cut off the feet in over half of the Covent Garden Performance. When will they ever learn feet require at least one meter of stage perspective.The Red Square portion is somewhat better in this regard. However, the outdoor staging is quite distracting.In my opinion, the Kirov Ballet Company is a near perfect human endeavor and deserves better. These recordings will become the standard by which future dancers will be judged."
2,not crazy in love with it,"i thought the chairs were plain but they actually have some flower design which i'm not crazy about. though i received it on time it came with no hardware to put it together. i've been waiting for the hardware for over two weeks. it sucks,but it wouldn't be worth returning because i wouldn't get half of what i paid back n i would have to pay the return shipping. so i'm keeping it and i guess it will be nice once i'm able to put it together. although i still have no idea when i'll actually be able to do that."
4,still top notch,"Volume 3 is my least favorite of the 3 released dvds. It is still a great collection of episodes, they just fall furthest off the storyline. ""Be Thou For the People"" is Ed's first assignment to inspect a coalmine, which doesn't further his search for the philsopher's stone. It shows Ed and Al's character, just how good of people they are, but not one of my favorite episodes. ""The Phantom Theif"" is a fun episode but still one that doesn't further the main storyline. Then the other two episodes is the two part ""The Other Brothers Elric"" which once again puts us on the path to the philosopher's stone with Elric brothers imposters. Good episodes, but they don't live up to the first eight episodes. Which brings me to one of my main gripes, you only get four episodes and no extras for a heafty price. I know this is characteristic of anime, but I wish they would do better. Still, I almost gave this five stars."
3,Modern pulp fiction,"This book was a quick read and once I accepted it as a piece of pro-American pulp fiction with corresponding weaknesses, I rather enjoyed it. I understand and agree with many of the complaints of other reviewers. The conduct of the British troops in Biloxi is not unreasonable considering that the British Army was unprepared for modern warfare. A long sea voyage, brutal combat and the discovery of strong drink could cause a break of discipline in 19th Century troops. In our current PC era, this will of course anger some people. I agree with Brian Glass' comments regarding the interview with Harrison at the back of the book. Harrison comes across as a stodgy old-timer, pining for the ""good old days"" and jealous of the success of younger writers. I am not inclined to seek out his other works at this time. Overall, if one has read all of Harry Turtledove's alternate histories, is not an anglophile and is looking for a light read to pass some time, this would be a satisfactory choice."
2,"Neat idea, no research....at all","I love books like this, if they are well done and at least on some level believable. Unfortunately, this one is neither. The author obviously has not bothered to research the period at all and most of the action frankly makes no sense. Is it possible the North and South would have joined together? I suppose so. In fact I commend Mr. Harrison for not portraying the Confederates as one dimensional, evil villains as so much other fiction does. That said, it does not seem plausible. Especially considering that they joined forces after the British ACCIDENTALY attacked the South. The most powerful Navy in the world can't tell Mississippi from an island? Apparently in Harrison's world the British are all buffoons and the unbreakable Union could defeat anyone simply because they are American. Overall, the book is a disappointment. I give it 1.5 stars, mainly for the idea."
4,"Harrison isn't Turtledove, thank God","Harrison offers a fresh idea on what if the British had intervened in the American Civil War, in this case as a result of the Trent affair. What's new about his take is that due to one mistaken attack, the British end up at war with both the USA *and* CSA. This book is billed as the first of a trilogy, but happily for the read, Harrison has avoided the worst excess of Harry Turtledove, the ""master of alternate history"". In other words, Harrison figures out to give each series book an ending, rather than just stop in mid-story."
2,anti british,This book was fun to read.But portraying the british army as rapists and thugs was out of order.And as for one brit soldier killing one of his own ncos because he tried to stop a rape what crud. The limeys are a funny bunch and the odd case of rape etc would happen in any army of that time.But as an American who has served along side the British Army their discipline now as then is rigid to say the least.
5,Outstanding Contemporary Christian Music!!,"Anyone that is familiar with Montrel's work, will not be disappointed with this CD. It is a must have for Gosel music lovers looking for a young R&B sound with word filled lyrics. For anyone that has Damita (or Detrick)Haddon, Mary Mary, or any of the other contemporary gospel artists out today, this CD is a must buy! The beats and sounds are more of what young people today want to jam to without sacrificing their Christianity. This CD has a very good variety of songs (upbeat & slow) that will make even secular music lovers stop and ask you what you are listening to."
4,The Spice and Herb Bible,"A comprehensive guide about all natural ingredients that add flavor to food - it helps adventurous chefs sort out their seasonings. Simply put, the Hemphills know their herbs and spices and this book provides a wonderful resource for both the novice and the experienced cook. Along with full-color photographs, you'll find historical information as well as tips on buying, storage and usage."
4,Small and durable,"I have had this watch for the last 3 years, recently changed the battery. Had to remove two of the links and fits perfectly. Not impressd with the bubble over the date and the numbers don't glow in the dark (not an issue for me but some people might like that feature), other than that no issues."
4,Good accompanying music,"After seeing the movie, I was eager to get this soundtrack, as the music seemed to fit the playful, yet sombre mood of the film. As an earlier reviewer said, a lot of the songs are comparable to the soundtrack to Garden State. Most of the songs from the movie are included on this recording, however, I was disappointed to notice that ""Cannonball"" by Damien Rice was not on this CD but was plainly in the movie. Other than that, if you liked the movie, chances are good that the music helped form your opinion, so pick up this soundtrack."
4,Touching,"I love Indian romances, this story line is touching and pretty much kept my interest. It was a first read for Author Madeline Baker."
4,Oldest Chapel in Scotland,"This is really an anthology with the works included of the listed authors. This small booklet has a description, photo's and history of Saint Margaret Chapel located within the walls of Edinburgh Castle in Scotland and it is still and stand alone structure. The next section is a wonderful biography of Saint Margaret Queen of Scotland and how she came to become Queen and change the landscape of what would become known as Great Britain and even Europe. A small write up reminds us that Saint Margaret is the wives' saint and a statue of her can be found at Lourdes. This is followed with a list of references for further reading and study as well as prayers. The last section gives a very detailed description on the symbolic meanings on the altar covering. All in all a very informative booklet."
4,Second in the Goldy series,"Caterer Goldy Bear is back to solve another mystery. This time she and son Arch are staying with a wealthy general and his wife in order to avoid her ex-husband who is harrassing her at every turn. She serves as a live-in cook, while Arch attends summer school at an exclusive academy which is nearby. She is dating two men, Tom Schultz, a police investigator, and Philip Miller who is a psychiatrist. One night she is following Philip on a drive back to his house when his car apparently goes out of control on the mountain road and he is killed. Goldy will not rest until she finds out who is behind Philip's death. Later on there is another complication when a dead body shows up in a swimming pool. Author Davidson further develops characters which she created in her debut novel, ""Catering to Nobody"", and weaves delicious recipes throughout this intriguing mystery."
5,mmm mmmmmmmm goooooood,"i've purchased and read all 16 volumes in a very short period of time. hoping ..... for more! if you can't eat just one potato chip, then you can't read just one volume!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! i've already shared with friends. they are being enjoyed by all!"
4,Delightful!!,"This particular broadcast was often shown in December every year in Sweden, where I lived as a child, so I have fond memories of viewing this stunning ballet at Christmas time. This was recorded in the early 70s so couldn't believe my eyes that it was now available on DVD. The costumes are SO incredibly lifelike, and the pastoral English countryside settings seem so quaint, when played against the beautiful music and dainty choreography. There is also quite a lot of humor woven into the sequences. One of my favorite scenes involves two mice that inevitably grow frustrated and end up trashing a girl's dollhouse, when they realize that all the food is inedible and made of plaster. I think any child that loves Beatrix Potter stories, ballet, animals, or all of the above, would find great amusement in this lovely film."
1,Disappointed,This is not what we expected. Not worth the money and time. It was very difficult to follow and my children didn't like it.
1,Bad design!,"The blades are way to small and the cups are to big and the ice gets lodged at start up locking the weak motor. It does mix well but as for chopping ice once you get it moving it leaves big chunks. The big boss blender was awsome and made snow, TWICE! THEN DIED! Im ordering the hamilton beach personal blender and its only 17 with two cups compared to the thirty three payed for this thing. The only good thing about this blender were the cups. They were big and had a handle and nice rimms for the cup. The motor is way better than the big boss, but the blade is to small. If the companies could work together they would have a winner. To bad. Ill update on the HB blender after I try it."
2,Amusing Read,"I found this book amusing & holding my attention throughout. As far as a safety book, I think there was more common sense stuff than anything groundbreaking or new. Typical retread saftey tip info however like I said it was amusing. The stories although I believe some to be fictitious were enjoyable.I recommend the book to read on the pure merit that it wont hurt you but don't expect anything spectacular."
1,"Smells like Celery??? Yep it sure does, Yuck!","I should have known by the price, that this was too good to be true. ($13.49 for the 2.5 oz size!) I was looking for a fragrance for my son , just starting High School, I read some other reviews and thought this fragrance would be perfect for a young man. I bought a tiny little bottle here on Amazon for him to try, it smelled great and he liked it. There is a reason this is so cheap, It must be really old or something because it smells EXACTLY like celery.The sprayer worked fine, although I can see where it would probably malfuntion , What a waste. So, unless you adore the smell of ""Celery"", pass this bargain up!"
3,I LOVE THIS BAND! BUT... Nails on a chalk board anyone?,"There are 2 great songs and 1 ok one on this Cd(everything else stinks)but I'd recommend the greatest hit's instead, these 3 are on it. I remember this particular album from the 80's and it doesn't bring back that fond of memories...Thank You!. ""Pleasure Victim"" has to be one of the most strident recordings ever made, the shrill production work will make anyone's ears bleed and their face cringe at too high of volume. Incredably amatuerish, too plinky, plonky, synthy wimpy, thrippity throppity, it has no bottom end, unless you turned up the bass to max level. Don't get me wrong I actually love this band (that's why I rated it 3 stars) the two 5 star Cd's(Love Life, Count Three and Pray) that preceeded this were stellar! by comparison. Try out their New Release ""VOYEUR"" instead ...IT ROCKS!"
5,Sex- Perfect!,"One of my many guilty pleasures, Berlin has always captured my heart... or my loins rather. This CD is so much fun with all its heart racing beats and lustful lyrics. Oh course i'd be lying if i didn't say that the track SEX is by far my favorite. So true and intellectual. Perfect."
5,A Great Sequel.,"The sequel to the Japan only Sonic Drift is more fun than Mario Kart (it beats all of the mario karts!) This is a racing game kind of like sonic R but EVERYONE is in cars. A little hard to get used to at first but is sure to delight, despite how old it is."
1,NOT BOFILL'S BEST,"DON'T GET ME WRONG, I LOVE ANGELA BOFILL'S TALENT. BUT, THIS RECORDING WAS NOT HER BEST. CLIVE DAVIS WAS PUSHING HER OUTSIDE OF HER QUIET STORM GENRE ONTO THE 80s POP MUSIC MAINSTREAM FARE. THE END RESULT IS THIS LARGELY FORGETTABLE MISTAKE. FOR BOFILL AT HER BEST, GET ""ANGIE"", ""ANGEL OF THE NIGHT"", ARISTA'S ""DEFINITIVE COLLECTION"", ""I WANT TO LOVE SOMEBODY"" AND HER MOST RECENT EFFORT, ""LOVE IN SLOW MOTION""."
5,The book I learned from.,I bought this book for my comprehensive ship-in-bottle book collection. I learned from an earlier edition of this book and now the author is my friend and mentor. I started out knowing NOTHING about this craft and nowless than 10 years later I find myself the first LADY President of the Ships-in-Bottles Association of America! This is a great book and highly recommended!
5,Yay,"I just love Walker Texas Ranger myself. I think that the last season is one of my favorites, so yay. It's a great show the whole family can watch, not many shows these days you can say that about. I really hope the other 7 or 8 seasons come out really soon. (For those how dont know, the first season had only 4 shows, so some like to not count it as a seasons. So this is why we get people calling it the 8th or 9th season set.)Yay, for the movie coming out on CBS on Oct. 16 at 9pm."
3,'Killer Queen:A Tribute To Queen' - Various Artists (Hollywood),"If you're a huge Queen fan,this tribute CD may entertain you.Personally,I believe that SO few bands should even try to play Queen remakes,but that's just me.Liked the Flaming Lip's covering ""Bohemian Rhapsody"",Anitgone Rising's take on ""Fat Bottom Girls"",Shinedown's ""Tie Your Mother Down"" and punk band Be Your Own Pet's ""Bicycle Race"" the best.Other tracks on this release are okay.I'll say this much,'Killer Queen...' is MUCH better than the last Queen tribute disc I heard,cannot remember the title,but it came out a while back,I believe on Hollywood Records."
4,Lasagna Grdenin for Small Spaces,The information in this book adds just the right touches to compliment the authors original book on lasagna gardening which I have used successfully in my garden and now will also use in the big pots on the patio. The remarks on choosing pots backs up what I have been trying to do these past years; all one color and material is right for our patio. Fall is finally on the way and the new big pots which will be planted lasagna style have to wait until after the rainy season but it's exciting to look forward to try this method. It is good to have this book in my reference library to go back to again and again. I enjoy encouraging fledgling new gardeners and this is one way to make that connection easier.
2,How did a lifeguard afford a new Corvette?,"Sam Elliott, all blow-dried and mustachioed in vintage 70s looks, tools around in a brand new Corvette in this 1975 film while still a county lifeguard at age 32. He makes 10 grand a year. He couldn't afford the car in reality. But is 32 so old? Today there are probably plenty of 30 something lifeguards, but this movie makes anyone over 30 seem vintage. The 1960 high school reunion is a hoot. I realized ""Moon River"" was their 1960 hit song. Gad, this movie came out a long time ago. And yet, I enjoyed it for its looks at a simpler time on the beach in southern California when the guys wore Speedos unembarrassedly. There's a surprising amount of smut here. The lifeguard has sex with a 15 year old, plus his stewardess girlfriend and his high school flame. There's a message here about doing your own thing. This relic has somewhat stood the test of time."
3,Good Machined - But There is a Problem,"I love the theory behind the Humax machine and it is incredibly easy to use (if you have ever used a tivo before, it takes about another 90 sesonds to figure out exactly how the Humax DVD burning features work) but I have only had mine for about two years and it is already crapping out on me. It has started resetting in the middle of shows I am recording or watching and it is doing so once or twice a day. It is basically dying and a tivo shoudl last longer than two years (the series 2 tivo's supposedly have a shelf life of 5 to 7 years - I have had one for 5 and it runs perfectly).It mihgt just be my machine but I would be reluctant about hbuying one of these. Get multiple opinions first (you don't want to spend $300 every two years)."
4,"""Credible Journey""",Mr. Rowland makes the journey of this intelligent dog working her way to the top of a prestigious government language school in the Monterey area surprisingly credible. Read it. And enjoy it. I did.
2,The only time it smells good is in the bag,"I like the idea of this litter, but my cats don't seem to want to use it. Also, it weighs very little and so the box has tipped at least once when the cats got out of the box. At least one kitty has peed in it, though, and it STINKS! This won't be a re-purchase."
3,A boring but informative read,"This book has become a family joke because I brought it to my mother in the fourth grade and she hated it. It's basically a very repetitive book detailing the inner workings of a department store. It's meant for children or perhaps foreigners who have no idea how a department store works. It has very little relevence in today's world because it was written in the 1960s and department stores have changed quite a bit since then. The illustrations are pretty good and overall it's a worthwhile read, if only to see how books used to be written. But if you have a degree in journalism like my mother does, stay away from it, because you'll probably hate it too!"
4,Blood Diamond,The movie is an interesting look at the diamond trade and how it can fund civil conflicts and create the opportunity for genocide. Leonardo DiCaprio does a good job as the soulless smuggler while Djimon Hounsou is a capable foil for the character.
2,A Lot of Bull and Poltical Correctness,"The movie was bad, dull, funny, unrealistic and preachy.A diamond has no birth certificate.Where it comes from is not relevantTo kind out where is Kinda like pissing into the wind.I'm sorry I even spent my time renting it in HD on cableSorry Leo"
3,the parts greater than the whole,"I liked a lot about the movie: the acting, scenery, subject matter. But at the end, it did not endear itself to me. The romance was unconvincing. The action sequences grant superman status to the stars. It felt like Cliff notes on recent African history."
3,BLOODY AND GRUSOME,"Blood DiamondBlood Diamond is about a man who is captured by rebels in Sierra Leone, on the West coast of Africa, and is made a slave panning for diamonds. When he finds one the size of the end of his thumb he tries to smuggle it out. The movie is about his trials and tribulations trying to reunite his family and get the diamond out. Leonardo plays a smuggler who is helping him for a share of the proceeds.Somewhat recommended for action adventure fans, but be warned it is bloody and gruesome in parts.Gunner October,2007"
1,No Piece of Mind,"This HD-DVD disc was defective when received from Piece of Mind, and would not play.Piece of Mind would not replace the defective disc.I will definitely not be purchasing anything from this vendor in the future."
4,Blood Diamond,"Es una película muy entretenida, donde constantemente tiene al observador en alerta. Muestra un crudeza y frialdad muy dura que posiblemente existe en algunos paises pero no siempre el espectador está acostumbrado a apreciarla, esto hace pensar y cuestionarse ciertas realidades del mundo. Por otra parte el final es un poco obvio lleganda a alargarse un poco. Las actuaciones en general son convincentes."
3,It's ok....,"If I can see a movie more than once,it's pretty good. If I can see it every time it passes through the cable box then it's very good. The Bourne Identity is very good. So is Groundhog Day. Blood Diamond is just a one-or two-time movie. I think the reason is that it's predictable. Zwick knows how to direct and the actions scenes hold your attention, De Caprio plays his part well and Djimon Hounsou (Gladiator) offers the audience a role that is reasonably believable. The problem is that it all falls apart at the end, when Hollywood takes over....I don't want to say more, given you may not have seen the movie yet....It is worth seeing...just not more than once....or twice...and one more thought...movies are art, or at least they are supposed to be...and art communicates with each one of us in a different and often unique way. What I mean to say is that just because I rate this movie with three stars doesn't mean that you should...."
5,Amazing!,"Where do I even begin to describe this film. Well, first off, we have an incredible cast that features other talents aside from DiCaprio. Houson and Connelly support this film immensely and provide the necessary mood that complements DiCaprio's character. The fact that they can immerse the audience in a seemingly tragic real-life based story is very commendable. This movie is sure to tug on some heart strings and make you feel the pain that actual people have experienced half way around the world. I would highly recommend this film and I thought this was DiCaprio's best film that year (2006). Though he was good in the Departed (2006), I'd have to say his role in Blood Diamond slightly surpasses his role in the Departed in my opinion. But don't take my word for it, go watch this masterpiece and form your own opinions =)"
4,"tim hardin's original version of ""If I were a carpenter""!!","Tim Hardin's version finally breaks through into mainstream use! Bravo to Universal. Tim's original cuts of ""Reason to believe"",and ""If i were a carpenter"" are so good, it is a shame that only a relativly small audience has been treated to his voice and phrasing. The rest of his works are poised to be discovered, recently ""dont make promises"" and ""hang on to a dream"" have been covered wonderfully by Paul Weller, and Kathryn Williams respectivly. look into his albums, you'll be glad you did."
4,Yet another good 70's compilation.,"This CD has some great titles from the 70's on it. Trouble is, so do a million other 70's collections. Don't get me wrong there is actually a couple of more scarcely known songs like Joanne by Michael Nesmith of Monkees fame. Another lesser known gem is Love me or let me be lonely by The friends of distinction. All the rest of the titles on this collection are solid hits. The transcription quality is pretty good and the packaging is slightly above average. If you have a pretty extensive 70's rock collection already you might want to pass this one up, but if you are starting a new collection, I would say this is highly recommended especially for the price."
1,want to buy but dont know what songs are on it,HOW do you sell an album or cd and not list the songs on it so a person can decide if they want it or it has the song or songs they are looking for.
4,Not All Live,I listened to the album and found that some of the songs are acutally recorded. I was hoping all of the songs would be live. The selections that were live are good but I have heard these recordings before on other albums. I did enjoy all of the songs on the album and feel it is a good mix of songs. A good choice for a casual Neil Diamond listener.
2,"Could have been better, and shorter","I'm going to go out on a limb here and give this book a negative review. It's not that I don't like Kafka, I've read most of his fiction and I think he was a brilliant writer. But this book just disappointed me. It's a few hundred pages too long--he pretty much makes most of his main points in the first part of the book and the remaining narrative seems superfluous and, well, tedious. Although his other two novels are also ""unfinished"" I think he expressed himself much more clearly in them. I agree with the other reviewers that this novel was about many things, i.e. the quest for truth, the frustration of the invididual facing the state and society itself, etc., but I think it could have been done better, especially by someone like Kafka. While reading ""The Castle"" I couldn't get over the impression that I was reading the first draft of something the author probably would have refined and improved had he lived longer."
5,the terrible truth,"Surely one of the most disturbing books written. A good translation that emphasises the alienation, dislocation and spiritual loss of life in this century and probably the next."
1,If you have to read Kafka...,"If you like Kafka, you'll like this book. Otherwise, probably not. Of his works, The Castle is more fully developed, less hectic, and generally a much better read than most. He takes the same themes he used throughout his life and delves in deeper and with a more human touch, sparing us the full extent of his obsessions, pretentiousness, and paranoia; the very things that make his work original and, to some, compelling. This tempered presentation of these same themes actually makes them more powerful and engaging. That said, it's worth noting that the book [stinks]."
1,Misses the essence of the rhyme,"If you, like me, insist on enjoying all your children's books, give this book a miss. The joy of this rhyme is watching the little ones act out the teapot part. Having the teapot fly a kite in china etc... doesnt satisfy. If you want to take your child on an adventure before bed time there are plenty of better books with much better art work."
5,Just discovered this band...,"....and have come to like everything they do. Their sound harkens back to the heavy-rock sound of the early mid-70s. Nothing gimmicky here, just solid epic-length Rock excursions. Give it a listen!"
3,So far so good! (EDIT: Red pixels popping on screen),"I use it to connect my LED monitor to my MacBook Pro. Works perfectly well on Windows 7 and Mac OS X Lion. And it's cheap!EDIT: I recently noticed some RED pixels pop on my screen when I watch video or play games. So I thought that either my Thunderbolt connection is having issues with the adapter, or a windows driver or something else. Switching to VGA cable and not using the adapter fixed my issue. So I ended up buying a mini-HDMI adapter and got rid of this one."
2,"Bought four, three work","Purchased four of these to couple my PC's graphic card with new HDMI monitors. Of the four adapters bought, three work but one is so poorly made that it won't take the male HDMI. They don't match the advertised image but that is less of any issue to me than the lack of quality control."
3,"Another disappointing cheesed out sequel to keep CRITTERS 2, GREMLINS 2 and HOUSE 2 company.","Why did the makers of this film purposely ruin it by going the comedy route instead of going straight horror with some real life humor thrown in? It worked for the original. What's even more frustrating is the trailer only shows the violent parts and very little of the humor, kind of like they knew the humor was a bad idea.An Army transport vehicle hits a pothole and drops a barrel of 2-4-5 Trioxen into a creek. Next thing you know zombies are running all over the place, but they're funny zombies, I mean, they'll still eat your brains, but they're not evil or mean just hungry.Worth watching for zombie fans, but after James Karen and Thom Mathews leave it just goes downhill.Also the original music score has been changed for this DVD release which is a sign to me that Warner Brothers could care less about this film."
3,"Good, but the first one was better.","This film is good, but I must say that I enjoyed the original alot better. This film still delivers in the gore and shocks department, though if you want to rent this, se the original first."
1,stick with the first one!!!!!!!,"after the scary and funny ""return of the living dead"" i couldn't wait to see this one,know what? turns out i could have waited to see it because this is the PITS!!!!!!!! how could they have blown this movie so bad!! not funny,not scary,and not worth the price!!!!!!!!! stay away!!!!!!!!"
5,This movie was the best one of them all.,"The remake of Night of the Living Dead 1990 was pretty good. But! Return of the Living Dead 2 was absolutely the best one. The makeup,and the zombies looked very convincing to me. I have to say though, I wasn't scarred. I used to work in a funeral home, and for a movie to frighten me it takes a lot of convincing.The effects were modern and very enjoyable. But, I still haven't seen a horror movie that has scarred the hell out of me yet. Never the less,I am still a big horror movie fan. And I will continue watching them untill I find the big one to ""scare the hell"" out of me. If anyone out there has any horror movie ideas for me, maybe there is one I missed. I have seen most of them, good and bad. Thanks"
4,Great Zombie Movie If You Understand It's A Spoof But What Happened To The Music?,"I loved this movie and still remember staying during the credits so I could hear the new ""Monster Mash."" Apparently, that is now gone and that ruins the movie for me. Though I really like the movie, if ""Monster Mash"" is gone, I don't want it"
3,HE WAS DIFFERENT,HE irv...was the head of a commune called KALIFLOWER in san fran back in the day...you had to be there!he like those days are long gone..the book lives on!
4,Bassey's Show Goes On!,"Recorded in 1996, this is Bassey's latest studio recording at the time of writing. It is her best album in years, and features her interpretations of current pop standards. Highlights in the 14 tracks include ""You'll See"" ""Hello"" ""Slave To The Rhythm"" ""Baby Come To Me"" and ""One Day I'll Fly Away"". This album has a more laid back sound compared to her recent cd's. Recommended to Bassey fans everywhere!."
4,Best Performance,Great movie with Burt Reynolds and an all star cast. They don't seem to make current films that are as good as the old ones in my opinion.
3,Dissapointing,"I hate to say it, but this game was a big dissapointment to me. The game can get very boring, because there's not much to do, except finding pieces of candy. If you seem interested in this game, rent it before you waste your money on it."
5,Excellent!!,"This is a great game! If you liked the books OR the movie, you'll love it. It's really ingenious the way you can play on multiple boards at once! And the way that your group has to work as a team has got to be a first!"
3,Fun if you are patient.,"Overall, my friends and I enjoyed playing this game. Especially, because we destroyed the Ring in our first game (other groups had been unsuccessfull). But there are a few pitfalls:1) It takes longer to set up the game and go through the rules than it takes to play it.2) The rules are not in a linear order. (i.e. you better read them all and UNDERSTAND them before you play.)3) The actions on some of the cards and boards are not clear. Better read the rules to be sure you understand them.4) If you have a tendency to lose game pieces this is not the game for you."
3,Could be better,Within 15 minutes of using it one of the tine spiders came off.. turned out the welds were in the wrong place and there was very little holding it on to the hub.. luckily the guy at the store I bought it from was willing to weld it back on for me so I could keep going. After maybe 4 hours of use the tires are slipping on the hubs so if I want to dig deeper than say 3 inches I have to push this tiller along to keep it going. It's not as if I'm pushing this tiller beyond it's limits but I did expect better from Troy Bilt.
4,More reviews found here...,"I have known John Swanson since 1977 (the year his team won the Bermuda Bowl) and even helped proof this manuscript (I wish I had done a better job, but you should have seen the ""before"" version). It's not up to me to review this book as my game is chess, not bridge (and I would be biased in any case).But I can tell you that John has collected many reviews of this book that appeared in bridge magazines and columns from all over the world in one place:[...]These collected reviews are 100% intact, and none that could be found have been left off of this page.If you want to see what real bridge experts have to say about this book, this is where to go."
4,"26"" Asian Ming Blue & White Table Lamp","Very pretty lamp for a reasonable price. Excellent packaging for safe arrival. However, lamp shade is beige and not white as mentioned in description. Also, I could not find anywhere on the lamp where it was UL approved, although it is mentioned in the description. Note the black paint on the faux metal to be sloppily applied in places; otherwise, I would recommend this lamp."
5,Works great,"Been using this feeder in my aquarium for several years now, and it is great. Simple design gives you one of those, why didn't I think of that moments."
2,Like so many other movies at this time.,"I now understand why they stopped making this DVD; it isn't worth the materials it's made of. The premise is like many other movies at this time where a dozen subplots and 30 odd characters finally converge in a grand coda. The problem is that none of the individual stories are very good, most of the characters are completely unlikable and the conclusion is so predicable and unsatisfying that you buy the DVD just to find out which bands were in the soundtrack so you can buy their MP3's."
3,Attention to detail,"I ordered this movie that I have been searching for for years and patiently awaited it's arrival! I must have not paid close enough attention to detail because when it arrived, it was in ITALIAN!!! Oh no!!! I remember reading the description and the details but somehow I overlooked this MAJOR detail. I realize it is my fault. I wondered why it took so long to ship; because it came from ITALY. This was only the second purchase I have made via AMAZON, and it was obviously a failure. Haha. Better luck next time. Thank you, though, it looks perfect. Perhaps this will be inspiration to learn the Italian language."
4,Fun!,"First of all, I don't know why critics were saying such horrible things about ""200 Cigarettes"". Okay, it may not be Oscar-worthy, but the cast is funny (especially Courtney Love as Lucy) and lovable.The film follows a bunch of young, 20-something people in East Village on New Years Eve 1981. The costumes are very eighties, the music is great and my favorite actress Kate Hudson was adorable in one of her first movie roles. The all-star cast; including Paul Rudd, Gaby Hoffman, Christina Ricci, Casey Affleck, Ben Affleck and Janeane Garofalo gives more stars than sneers. I also liked Martha Plimpton as cynical, grumpy Monica. The cameo by Elvis Costello was fine as well."
2,Decent,Not as good as I thought it was gooing to be the sock thing get discusting and you have to wash it everytime you use it very well or its pointless and its fabric so its not easy. all the little particles are still incased in it and becomes slimy if the had a diffrent type of catcher for the yucky stuff it would be great.
1,Open Adoption Experience: Complete Guide for Adoptive and Birth Families,I really don't like this book. I am having to force myself to read it.
1,Palm lllc Hotsync cradle,"You have sent the wrong cradle. you sent a palm v series cradle and we ordered a cradle for the palm lllc. The one that was sentis incompatible with the palm lllc pda. We will be returning this cradle. The seried v has a curved base, and a female connector, the palm lllc base should be straight and have a male connector in the base to fit into the female connector of the pda unit."
4,It works,"Let me start by saying that I'm not affiliated with this company in any way. I just turned 44 years old. In the last 6 months I began getting pronounced creases under my eyes. I tried another product that was well over $100 and got moderate results that took weeks to kick in, and the product had a strong unappealing fragrance. I ran out of it, and while I was debating getting more, I found a sample of the Menscience Eye Rescue that a friend had given me a while back. After using it I saw good results within a couple of days. I bought a tube and am very pleased with its effect on my skin...and there is no bad odor. I would give this product a 5 star rating if it literally shaved 15 years off my face, but let's be realistic. Maybe it reacts differently with different body chemistry, but it certainly works very well for me...and it's affordable!"
3,I'm no expert in fake mustaches,"The little ring that goes in the nose was difficult to put on in my kid's nose, besides being very uncomfortable. Instead we used double stick tape, which worked okay for about five minutes. I would explore different fake mustaches if I were in the market for them again, even though these performed well enough to get the kids all dressed up and snap a few photos. But that was about it."
4,Same sound as early T. Lizzy,"I would compare this album to that of the early Thin Lizzy material ( Shades of a Blue Orphanage, Vagabonds) minus the story telling aspects of those albums. Very relaxed album and as the earlier reviewer stated their are not any really ""rocking"" tunes compared to the mid 70's Lizzy but overall a wonderful album and worth getting now since it will probably never come out domestic (US)"
1,You would have lost your shirt,"Kwong's advice just doesn't hold water:1. If you had followed his strategy on the positive yield curve relationship between 3 month and 3 year rates, you would have been long the market for all of 2001 and the first half of 2002. You would have lost 30 to 40% of your portfolio value.2. Despite his ""long term"" viewpoint, you would have traded in and out of the market frequently, about 20 times over the past decade, and have been eaten alive by the commissions, with none of the benefit of active selection for market outperform.3. His business, tradingmarkets.com, is a Day Trader site! That should tell you his inclination. Go visit the site if you don't believe me. He is a confused man.Simplistic, unsupported approach. Do Not Follow It."
1,nice simple controls but absolutely terrible radio,"I bought this CD/radio for my kids, primarily because it looked to have nice simple controls. Unfortunately, the radio only pretends to be digital (the tuner display) -- it's actually an analog radio and a very poor one at that. In fact, it's effectively unusable as a radio because it won't 'lock' to a station, even when the 'digital' tuner says the correct frequency."
4,Reliable and accurate.,We have three of these units and they work great. The most recent one replaced another brand that finally mal-functioned after ten years....but we like this Chaney one more.
3,Anne Mather,"In spite of her first, never-to-be-forgotten encounter with Luis Salvador, Morgana had hardly expected her plane to be hijacked to his remote hideout in the high valley of the Rio Quimera. 'Do not be alarmed. My reasons for keeping you are completely dissociated from personal desire,' he told her. But..."
5,Limmortelle by Piaf,The CD arrived in very good shape and the selection of Piaf songs were also very good. I would recommend this CD.
4,Neat Little Knife,"Great little knife,... great looks, great quality, nice sheath that wraps around and grabs and protects the handle... just a tad too small...."
2,"Ok, but could have been better","The photographs are very good, but much of the text is not very interesting. Often it consists of long lists of genera in alphabetic order with little explanation.Overall, it is a usefull reference for fossil identification."
5,As an STD Patient Advocate...,"and as a advocate in the world of STD's for many years, I would highly recommend this book to anyone. It's not just for those who have experienced the physical issues that surround an STD diagnosis; it delves much deeper into the psychological and emotional aspects as well.This book is a great resource for those living with an STD and provides as much of a step-by-step process to emotional recovery as any I have read.I would highly recommend that anyone who is single and dating to pick up this book and read it cover to cover, perhaps even a couple of times. It will prepare you for the day when one of my 60 Million peers approach you with ""The Talk"" where they will disclose their own personal status and allow you to make a well informed decision on whether to continue the relationship or not.Be sure to purchase your own copy and not borrow it, you will want to use a highlighter.GaylaBoth a participant and reader of this book"
5,An organ genius in the making.,"I saw Cameron playing organ live at First Congregational Church of L.A. (home of worlds largest church pipe organ) April 18, 2010 to a packed crowd. He is a modern day organ genius, prodigy. All attendees were VERY impressed, both with his music, style, comments and techniques.This was a predecessor of subsequent great recordings by Cameron Carpenter."
3,Directions with visuals of tool pieces? Not!,"Frustrating to the max! No directions on how to use, assemble, with Dremel tool. Why should I have to go online and search for assistance. I have worked with tools most of my adult life so figuring it out, I did, but not be able to use it properly the first time. As I mentioned, there was no description for the tool accessories and I purchased a new one!"
4,nice,I got this and it done what I needed done but would be nice if it was alittle easier to change the tips.
4,Not the best fit but it's cool to have for SNK fans like myself.,"I gave this hat a high 4 stars simply because it's cool to have for a fan like myself. Terry Bogard is my fav fighting game character so I'm glad to have it hanging in my room. It's a cool replica hat and the lettering is just like on Terry's hat. The reason I don't give it 5 stars is because it isn't an exact fit for my head even when I adjusted it, even so it will fit a lot of people correctly. But I'm still happy that I have it."
3,Can anyone tell me which episodes are in this dvd?,"I'd like to know which episodes are on this one before I buy it, but they don't list that information in the description. Does anyone know?"
4,Packaging of DVD,"I got the Kane DVD today and I was very disappointed with the packaging because they put it in sleeves instead of hubs! I hope they don't start doing this, I just have to be more careful with it."
5,Great brain stories for adults,"If you liked the Great Brain series as a kid, Uncle Will is worth tracking down and picking up. While it can stand alone, it is more enjoyable if the previous two books have been read. Of the three ""adult"" books by Fitzgerald in this series, this seems to be the most expensive. I've seen ""Papa Married a Mormon"" and ""Mama's Boarding House"" for under $10 and would recommend starting with those. What is disconcerting is that if you can remember some of the antics from the Great Brain series, some of the anecdotes in ""Uncle Will"" bear an uncanny similarity, which leaves one wondering the true origins of the stories in the books."
5,Gorgeous gown,"Gorgeous gown of good quality. Necklace is just ribbon with velco attached. Headband doesn't stay on my granddaugher's head very well. Overall, I'm very pleased."
3,Meh...,"I got this after all the workout sites said it would be good for muscle restoration. I work out with a bunch of guys that area about 8 years younger and to be honest, I was looking for any help that I could get. I'm not really noticing much difference since I've been on it and I'm almost through the bottle.I will say, the ""tasteless"" is not tasteless...there is a flavor to it and it is not pleasant so be prepared to drink it with a drink with some flavor to it to hide the taste. If you are thinking water, it's not going to be a good day..."
5,Makes a difference,Mixes well into my other drinks and really is tasteless. It's also been effective in cutting down recovery time with 5 to 10 grams of it taken with a protein shake.
3,ON Whey Protein already has glutamine,"I just wanted to comment that ON Standard Whey Protein already has 4g of glutamine per scoop, no need for additional supplementation if you use that product."
4,You will feel better,"I have used Glutamine in the past, but this time I can feel the recovery in my body.I changed my workout to one of the Men's Health Big Book of Exercises.. it is challenging me to new ways of lifting, and still my body is recovering very well with the Glutamine."
4,price is good,"i like mhp glutamine alot better but the price on this is right, it does an ok job, mhp gives u massive results"
1,Are they kidding?,This is $44 for a 1 ONE GB thumb drive???? I get these free all the time from suppliers.Don't waste your time or money.
5,Yummy,"Lots of Chocolate, real good2nd year I bought this and have never had any problem with this product.Great with coffee too"
5,All I Can Say is WOW,"This has to be one of the best Blues Guitar cd's I've heard in the past few years, and I have over 3000 blues cd's. The guy just keeps putting out great stuff.If your a Heavy Blues Guitar lover this is a Keeper. Please buy this cd and help support our dieing breed of blues musicians"
2,Not bad in it's time...,"Well i was 18 at the time this song came out. I saw the video on Video Music Box (which at the time was 1 of few ways to really the only way to stay on top of the hip-hop scene) and back then i used to record the vide on my VHS (i actually still have the tape). I remember the track being hard. I expected more from them at the time but as you know expectations in the rap game can be a bit foolish at times (see Fabolous). The courus stuck in my head ""Room to Breath""...the brotha had a Chuck D kinda voice. Anyhow, it's not a bad track...one to have if you are a real hip-hop head in your mid 30's."
5,Barry Roars Back!,"This CD is a great and righteous throw-back to simpler times. The arrangements are elegant and serve Barry's voice particularly well. His version of ""Venus"" seems to explode from the CD as Barry is accompanied by what the CD describes as a ""Heavenly Choir"" - featuring the incredible voice(s) of one Connie Nassios. This one's a winner!"
5,Just one word does justice!,"P E R F E C T I O N ! Being a Manilow fan since the mid '70's, this has got to be one of his best ever. A few month's back, I bought a couple of his releases: ""The Essential"" & the older ""Manilow Sings Sinatra"". As with the latter, this is a tribute, especially to the great vocalists & song writers of the 50's. The originals are still great but Mr. Manilow somehow captures the essence of these songs and reinterprets them to his style. Comparing these songs is like comparing apples to oranges. Let these songs stand on their own merits and you will love them. I am not particularly a fan of the 50's but this collection sure makes me appreciate what I once shrugged off as music that only my parents could love. The Sinatra tribute was great but this selection is impeccable. Having style & class in today's world is almost impossible to find, but Barry and Clive Davis sure found them this time around. Like I first said, one word: PERFECTION"
4,A triumph for music,"Barry Manilow dominated the mainstream charts in a time when The Carpenters and Tony Orlando could acheive. He even mustered a Disco hit or two. I've always found his music pleasant though too white-bread for my tastes.But I admired his tender, if not sometimes schmaltzy, lyrics. Now comes his ode to the 1950's. Ironcially, this music is even more bland than his own. The result: A #1 record twenty years past his ""prime"".I say BRAVO! So he's not exactly my cup of tea, but in an era when Paul Simon is an asterisk to the self-agrandizing and nearly talentless Kanye West, I have nothing but kudos for Barry's amazing (and literal) waltz to the top of the American music charts.First Michael Buble', now Barry Manilow!! Is society ready to retrograde to a time of sophistcation in a graceless age? I doubt it, but this is a start.GO BARRY GO!"
2,Mediocre.,"Banilow looks great with his new nose job on the front cover , and be cursed anyone who says otherwise! but this very compilation, I believe, lacks sincerity, passion, truthiness, so to say:)"
1,Very Bad,"En realidad el producto me salio malo y no sirvio. Mi telefono es un Nokia 3300, pero no sirve el hands Free que compre.Premium Hands Free Boom Mic Headset for Nokia 6101 / 6102 / 6102i / 6103 / 9500 / 9300 / 7610 / 7270 / 7250i / 7210 / 6822 / 6820 / 6800 / 6682 / 6670 / 6651 / 6620 / 6610 / 6585 / 9500 / 9300 / N90 / 6235 / 6560 / 6255i / 6230 / 6225 / 6200 / 6170 / 6100 / 6020 / 6019i / 6016i / 6015i / 5140 / 5100 / 3589i / 3588 / 3587i / 3586i / 3585i / 3585 / 3570 / 3300 / 3220 / 3205 / 3200 / 3155i / 3120 / 3100 / 2285 / 2270 / 2116i / 2115i / 2125i / 2126i /"
4,Awesome,Ok let me tell u now this game is awesome. I played it in a arcade and i got hooked and begged my parents to get me it off the net.And trust me when i got it a year ago rite off amazon it was not cheap (50 bucks!!)anyway this game is alittle different from the arcade because you dont have a team with two people its just another guy that does a little attack every time u call them in.SOme of u might say thats the best part and ur right but its still a great game get this game if u can!
3,Not as good as the other two,"I bought this game when it first came out and less then a week I beat it with almost everybody and was ridiculously bored with it!The game play was not at all thrilling. I did however like some of the characters' special moves/combos. When I got the secret characters, I got the feeling of ""What's the point?!"" Really no different from playing with theircounter parts.Storyline/Endings (especially with me not being familiar with the Dark Stalker characters at that time) was confusing and not worth the time to read it and just blahGood thing is I did find a new fighter to love and use, Morigan."
4,ONE OF THE BEST MUSICAL ARRANGEMENTS IN THE GLAMROCK ERA!,"Steve Harley is one of those unsung heroes that was regrettably, totally passed by, by the U.S. music scene of the 1970's. If you have any questions as to what ""gems"" you may have missed in those days, this rocker is sure to shed light on at least a few lp's worth of pure gold, for your listening pleasure. This album is a good start..."
4,Rate,Could have used less markings but it worked for me as it was. It was easily read for the semester.
3,"Undestandable and easy,but fragile and sensative","This item is easy to use and understanding of the steps, calories, and distance. But very fragile and easy to fall from ones waist. I had it for only 3 days and broke already. I feel not supportive on your waist to hold on. So I bent over few times, and it fell off and broke in half. Not durable for price. Was too good to be true."
2,My first reading of A.S Byatt's work...,"I think this was probably a bad book to pick. I liked how she was descriptive, but sometimes I didn't see how the pieces of Matisse's work connected with the story. The first two stories were the best, but I found the third one to just be boring and depressing."
4,American Delta revisited,"Michael Tarbox and bandmates take decades-old songs and re-invent them with a new verse, or new tempo, or whatever they choose. The sound (gravelly vocal, bluesy guitar, upright bass, fiddle) feels like it was dredged up from the ooze of the Mississippi Delta. Keep in mind though, they are from Boston! The tunes sound familar, because its the sound of America in the 1920s and 1930s. A solid debut and a great, unique sound."
4,A worthy book about a worthy character,"One thing that delighted me about this book and about the person of Michael Faraday was the mixture of science and faith. While these two disciplines have parted ways and are no longer intertwined for many in the modern world, Michael Faraday is an intriguing example of both a devout believer and a ground breaking researcher.Faraday's story also has immense appeal as it relates his rise out of humble beginnings on the basis of his own genius and merit, in contrast with the lingering emphasis of his time on inheirited wealth and position.My only criticism is that the author, who evidently has written much in the realm of art history, adds a bit more content on art to this biography than seems justified.On the whole, I recommend this book as it is a well told tale about a significant and intriguing character whose story is very much worth retelling and considering anew."
5,Great Item,"Good savings on product for one, saved on shipping, very ez start, pushes ez. Bag comes off easy for emptying,just need to empty often else it gets hard to push (lol) found out the hard way. Great item for the money."
2,"An orginal, plot with a slight twist.","This book was the kind where you don't want to put it down till you're through, then you get through and think 'Well It Wasn't That Great'. It's definalty had a twisted plot seeming a little to unrealistic. Still, if you're one who follows this series you might as well read this one too, although I don't recomend it."
3,"small,easy",This game is fun in the beginning when you get all these characters - boring - I got it on the first week it was out its a waste of money! I beat it the very first week I got it it's plain easy. Expert gamers beware don't buy it. All beginners will love it. ....
4,...,"Its a preety cool game you will want to play again and again! A bit short, thats for sure but fun. It could of been better, but it wasent, and thats to bad. They should of made it bigger like Kirby Super Star, now thats a good, long game! I recomend Buying it. Seeya dilligent buyers!"
1,Kirby's back!,"I got this game when it came out, and this is the first Kirby game i hate. Save your money for something better, or get like Perfect Dark."
2,I dont think so,"this game gets boring too fast, i think. i borrowed it from a friend and got bored in about 1 hour. you might want to rent this game before buying it. take my advice; you might thank me for it."
2,This Game is a Disaster!,"Personally, I thought that all of Playstation's Army Men titles were pretty lackluster! The graphics failed to maintain my interest for more than ten minutes and I found that navigating your way through certain levels was a major pain in the arse, especially the first level! To tell you the truth, I found N64's version of Sarge's Heroes to be a more thoroughly entertaining game - a real challenge. The graphics might be a bit cartoonish to some but I thought the controller configuration was a lot more manageable. It's too bad that N64 hasn't developed a version of Army Men: World War. My advice is: refrain from buying any of Playstation's Army Men titles and hope to god that Nintendo decides to put out their own version of World War. Nintendo does have its merits!"
1,DISAPPOINTED!,"I wasted countless hours reading info on this game. I thought this would make my Dad play video games with me and instead it was a game that I made him return. Don't get me wrong I love war games, but this game had nothing going for it. To begin with, the first 4-5 levels are a visual mess; all the objects on the screen seem to melt into a solid green blur. You can barly see your own guy let alone the enemy. The next problem concerned the aiming system. It was the worst that I have ever seen in my 15 years of gaming. You have to spray a certain area until you are able to direct your line of fire to the exact spot you want to shoot. I could go on and on about this game. I'm begining to think that I should buy the game back and smash it on the ground so that no other gamer has to go through what I did."
3,Quality has really declined,"This Troy-Bilt Pony is the third one I have owned. This one replaced a model that was stolen from me. The Amazon price and free shipping is certainly a good deal. I am really concernied about the quality of this model nowadays. Obviously Troy-Bilt is no longer manufactured by the original company and it really shows. The components include alot of plastic parts and covers, the controls are not easy to use, and there are sharp edges where we grab the auto release safety handles. While the Amazon price makes this a somewhat reasonable investment, I do not think that this version will last as many years as my other models.Next time, I plan to put the money toward a BCS...a high quality tiller with machined parts, but WAY more expensive than Troy-Bilt. I guess we get what we pay for."
3,meh,"Ok espresso.Some crema. With my particular machine, overstuffed pods work a bit better (but they are not for most people and most machines).There's a lot of tannin quality to it. I suspect it is a robusto blend. Many people like that. Sometimes it can be good in a latte or flavored latte to balance sweetness, but the taste was a bit much like starbucks."
3,Pretty Good - but sketchy packaging.,"Looked and tasted exactly how it's described, however the taste was a little too bitter. So from 5 stars I deducted one for taste and one for the packaging since the individual packs came in a zip lock bag. Just makes me question the source, handling and quality."
4,"Tastes good, but too much packaging","I really like the canned LavAzza ground coffee, so I tried these pods. Tastes good and I would have 3 or 4 shots every morning. The pods make the espresso making process much quick and clean. However, my only gripe is that each pod is individually wrapped in a blue plastic pouch, like in the product photo. If you make as much coffee as I do, this amounts to a lot of trash! I would have preferred to get all the filter paper pods in one larger zip-lock bag or even resealable coffee can."
3,meh,"Each pod is still individually sealed, but as others have noted, these are clearly repackaged from a larger item that has been broken down, despite being clearly labeled as not for individual resale. This really matters because you can't see the expiration date. That said, mine have been of fine quality. It's important to consider how problematic this practice is for you before ordering."
3,These are just OK.,They haven't worked really well in my Gevalia coffee pod maker. I am not sure if I need a different style pod.
3,It's OK,I first started using Starbucks espresso pods. I wanted to try a few different brands so I decided to give Lavazza a chance. The package was shipped quickly and was exactly what they said it would be. After making my first latte I wasn't very fond of the flavor of this espresso. It's not as bitter as the Starbucks pods which is good but the overall flavor is too earthy for me.
2,Not what I expected,I was looking for a sun hat with a little style for playing golf in S. Florida. The pictures depicted a fairly rigid brim but the brim as well as the crown is very floppy and does not hold shape. Item description states that the sweat band is elastic but the one I received has no elastic. I'm keeping it only because I can always use an extra sun hat for guests.
1,Missing parts,"It was a bit frustrating to see that after an hour of assembly we were missing a part and another capacitor was held together with tape. For 11 bucks i didn't expect much, but i did expect to get all the parts and not disappoint my kids..."
5,"Yes, this is the album with the song GM uses in their spots","I love this album, and the song Bucket Seat, in paricular.I do a radio show that has been airing spots from General Motors. Lots of listeners have been searching for that song that GM used in those commercials for awhile that had the words:Tell me where you areAnd I will jump into my car...Well, I finally contacted my good friend, Toni Simonetti, who is the head of Corporate Communications at GM. She wrote me back with the answer: the song was not created specifically for GM and their commercials, it was licensed from an album that's several years old. The song is called Bucket Seat, it's sung by Sam Bisbee, and it's available on this CD,Enjoy.David LawrenceOnline Tonight/The David Lawrence Show/The Net Music Countdown"
4,What was expected,Great version. Exactly what it said it was going to be & what I expected. Very pleased!
3,Not Zoot's best of the Era,"I was originally excited when I saw this 1960 reissue on Bethlehem featuring Zoot backed by only a rhythm section and a track list full of standards. But I must admit that upon listening to it several times I am somewhat disappointed. Don't get me wrong, it's not terrible and indeed a few cuts shine brightly, but when compared to his early to mid 50's recordings with a similar ensemble this session just lacks chemistry. I can't really put my finger on it but there's just that ""oomph"" missing that makes you want to play it over and over again. It might be the rhythm section whom I don't really recognize other than pianist Dave McKenna. The tunes just seem to bounce more than swing. Check out ""That Old Feeling"" for Zoot's high watermark of the 50's."
2,Do not believe the hype.....,"This product appeared to be a positive alternative to the main stream retail brands and did appear to work in the initial two to three weeks.However, under the test of mild stress I had a break out worse than I have had all this year. I have oily skin with the occasion moderate breakout / open pores but nothing like when I used this product and the price compounded the matter.I think it would be more useful investing in your internal health rather than external e.g.) Colon and Liver, reassess your diet and maybe Fiberzon (Amazon Herbs) or the three day apple diet."
3,Peggy Lee - Things Are Swinging/Jump For Joy,"I have always enjoyed Peggy Lee's music, in this CD two of her LP albums combined, offers you the chance to listen again ""I Am Beginning To See The Light"" and ""You're Getting To Be a Habit With Me"". Her interpretation for ""Just in Time"" is just right including Irvin Berlin's ""Cheek To Cheek"". The two orchestral backings of Jack Marshall and Nelson Riddle did justice to her voice. The music selection contains numbers as far back as 1958. If not for the MONO recording I would have given the CD a four stars rating. With modern recording technology I cannot understand why it was not released with ""simulated"" stereo effect."
1,Defective product,"I was initially happy that I could find this cartridge for my older model canon printer. When I opened the package I noticed the product appeared to be a used recycled cartridge - in a used box, with a typed BC-05 label stuck on the cartridge. I tried the product in my printer, and it was damaged and had no ink. It was worthless! What a waste of money! Beware buying ink cartridges!"
2,not pure,"This is a proprietary blend of CLA so you can't really be sure how much Tonalin CLA you're getting per capsule and how much of the other stuff (stearic acid, etc.) is in each pill."
3,Cla 1200,Didn't see any difference after taking this for a month. Also gave me stomach cramps. Doesn't really hold up to it's claims. Thank you
3,No directions?,I ordered this product and am hoping it will help with my weight loss/ toning however I am disturbed that it did not come with any product inserts!
2,"Eh, 2.5 Rating","CLA came pretty highly recommended by fellow dieters on a support forum,and after only 7-10days I could see some mild results. However, after the entire bottle was gone, those initial results now seem paltry in comparison to the rave reviews CLA has garnered (to the point I now question whether it was CLA as much as the change in diet & increased exercise).This may be one of those 'works for some, not for others' type things, so all I can say is if you're REALLY wanting to try it, then the $12 price tag isn't too bad at all for the amount you get (avg out to 30day supply @ 3 caps a day)."
3,Not impressed,"This kit is a starter kit definitely. The bag is really small and is about the size of a child backpack, the ponchos are the same ones you can buy at a 99 cent store. The ""blankets"" are actually mylar sheets that you can buy at a health and beauty store and the first aid kit is weak. The water and calorie bars are the only thing of value. Do yourself a favor and buy a more expensive kit."
5,Hope I don't need it,Hope I don't need it but happy to have it stashed away. You never know when you may have to bail.
3,not worth it - but got me started on my go bag,"i don't think this bag is worth it's cost, even through amazon and prime. but it got me started on my go bag. First off, the water provided is good enough for 1 day of water for 2 people so already it's lacking compared to advertised. i didn't even look at the food, but people need water MUCH more than they need food. We can survive weeks w/o food compared to days without water.The other items are useable but not great. I put everything from this kit into a larger comfortable (read you can carry it for miles) bag then I put some LED lights in it as well as a knife, starter sticks and some medicine. My kit will grow over time i'm sure.This is something I wanted to start on YEARS ago but never did. Buying this kit got me focused on it, even if it's overpriced for it's contents.I live in the bay area, ca where threat of natural disaster comes in the form of an earthquake. Being prepared to leave your home is a reality here."
5,complete kit,"I haven't had to use it yet, but all you need to servive the unexpected is in there. Food,water, blankets, first aide .It's a must have"
4,"a good start, I think","Emergency kits are always a good idea. This is, I think, a good start. I have already added a little swiss army knife. I also plan to add some duct tape. I don't know why, yet, but I think that a roll may be helpful. I think that the main purpose of a kit like this is to get us started.Anyway, one of the main reasons that I bought the kit, and that I liked it after I got it is that it is not too heavy. I will be adding stuff, lightweight, to the kit that will be packed at the bottom. Even for me, I can carry it easily and comfortably with the weight as purchased. I will add to the pack carefully, putting lighter things at the bottom of the pack so I can easily carry it. I will, hopefully never need it.However, it will be there if I do. This pack will stay in my car...so it will be available to me no matter where I am when an emergency happens."
1,Disapointed,"I purchased this item for a gift,but when my little nephew got it he said that the string that pulls the balloons back and launches it had no elasticity to it. The balloons only when about 2 inches out of the launcher. He was very disapointed but his older brother is going to rigg it for him. I would not buy this item again!"
3,Not my Fav,"I wanted to like this cookie, it's very moist & chewy, has plenty of raisins & walnuts, but something about the flavor just doesn't appeal to my palate. I'll stick to the ginger & peanut butter. Like Pamela's other gluten free cookies, the texture is wonderful & can't detect that they are gluten free."
2,A safety concern,"I am a fan of Pamela's gluten free products and have been happy with all of them until I got the Raisin Walnut Cookies. I just received the order a couple of days ago. I've eaten four of the cookies and they are very good tasting. However, in two of the four cookies I found myself chewing what presumably was walnut shells! I could have easily chipped or broken a tooth.Pamela's makes some great products but this one is ""risky""."
5,Very Likely the Finest Contemporary Translation of the Bible,"Combining outstanding scholarly integrity, accuracy, clarity, as well as a suberb English style which is vibrant, beautiful, and remarkably readable, the Revised English Bible is arguably the finest contemporary translation of the Scriptures. In passages evidently applying to both genders, the revisers have preferred a more inclusive gender reference (but without the more extensive linguistic adjustments adopted by the New Revised Standard Version). The Revised English Bible deserves a much wider use in North America, both for personal reading and in the churches."
3,ecw,"The game is fun for my son, he has a great time playing it. He said it lets him choose his own favorite star."
3,Nothing Special,"I'm be straight foward, I'm a huge ECW fan, but this game is a disapointment. Sure it's okay, but nothing special. The only improvements from Attitude is the barbwire matches and some added moves and different wrestlers. To say the least, very bad for ECW. I hope the next game: Anarchy Rulz, will be much better I've seen pictures of ladder matches and inferno matches and a octagon cage match. I hope that game is mega cool."
3,ECW with WWF Attitude!,"That is the best way to describe it.It looked cool in the pictures but lacked when it came down to it.The barbed wire match is cool but create some new inavative ways to throw people in it.Put it this way,as long as it takes to get a table is as long as it will take wcw to win the ratings.Well the good thing about it is if Anarchy Rules is any good I have something that I can trade funcoland.All in all OK game"
4,a good Karen Kingsbury read,This book is one of the better Karen Kingsbury books I have read in the last 2 Years. Although it is not as good as the books in the Cody Gunner set it is still quite a good read and worth the time. Although this can be a stand alone book it is better to read all 3 in the Forever Faithful set. The bonus of 3 books means you get to enjoy more depth of the characters in 3 books instead of just 1. I like the author's writing style and strong characters in this book as well as the story idea. I will read more from this auther when I find other winner books she has written. My other reccommendations from Karen Kingsbury are from the Cody Gunner set- A Thousand Tomorrows and Just Beyond the Clouds.
4,Read in one night,"It took about 4 hours and I had this book that I had received as a gift finished. I expected it to be slow and boring (like another christian series I was given) and was surprised of how much a page turner it is. Even though I had empathy for Jade I did feel that Conner forgave in haste. In reality, we may want to forgive on the spot but it takes time for our hearts to catch up to the ""right"" thing. I would have like to have seen more realistic emotions."
3,Dry Read,"The concepts of the book are very interesting, and some of the articles are engaging, but overall I found this book to be an tedious and dry read."
4,A Feel Good Book,"This was a feel good book. It is a story of Erma Lee who flees a brutal marriage with her grandduaghter Cher. Cher's mother is in prison. Erma Lee goes to work for a rich elderly woman named Miss Claudia, who has a few secrets herself. They develope a wonderful friendship and Erma Lee learns to love herself and life. It is a nice story with some hidden secrets that adds a bit of intrigue."
4,REM's big breakthrough,"This album introduced the world to REM. It also showed a huge growth in songwriting and musicianship from their earlier albums (Murmur, Reckoning, etc). This album is known for the huge hits ""The One I Love"" and ""End of the World As We Know It"" but top to bottom all the songs here are strong and veryd diverse. Finest Worksong begins the album with intelligent neo-metal, then you get some trademark REM jangle rock. The next curveball is the horn-driven semi-swing of Exhuming McCarthy. The stylistic experiments all work, and you still know it's REM the whole time. This album may not be REMs best (that will be debated between Out Of Time, Automatic for the people and Murmur) but it's just a notch below and a must for any fan of REM and/or rock n roll. ENJOY!!!"
4,The Album That Made REM,"While REM had had 4 previous albums w/ underground hits like radio free europe and driver 8, it was not until document that they finally broke through and got a radio hit w/ the one i love. the band's last indie album, it was their 1st 2 gain widespread popularity because of the top 20 hit status of the sarcastic and often misunderstood the one i love and the rapid fire political its the end of the world as we know it. this album shows the greatness that was in store 4 yrs 2 come. if you aren't overly famililar w/ the indie REM music (except 4 the 2 hits from this CD), but like more modern REM, this is a good place 2 start, as 2 see what the band was like in its early days"
3,not that great,"Bought it to read aloud to my 7th graders. I think I read one chapter/story. I just didn't find it that appealing/appropriate to the middle grades. If anything, check it out from the library first."
2,Better options out there,"Recommended in Well-Trained Mind but WAY too difficult for that age-level, and the writing is somewhat old-fashioned and dry. Better for adult reading."
2,Romantic? Not in the least.,"First, it's written in first person, which makes it a bit in your face. The characters are difficult to warm up to and the plot is weak and simplistic. If I hadn't taken a course on speed reading, I wouldn't have made it to the end of the book. I kept hoping it would get better, but it never did. If you want a good BDSM story read Joey W Hill, Cherise Sinclair or Claire Thompson - all written in third person and all highly rated. This one is two stars at best."
3,breaking the girl,"Very interesting subject but not developped enough, needs more detail BDSM action in a stronger manner, more descriptive from the girl's point of vue"
1,I can't believe I read the same book,I had bought this book from all the rave reviews & I can't believe that we read the same book. I kept waiting for the book to get good. I do not find anything romantic or good when the girl in this book gets beaten and locked in basement. I hated this book & i just don't get where the other reviewers can possibly think that this is love.
4,Murder And Erotica,Well acted and atmospheric modern noir thriller with Kathleen Turner creating sexual electricity in her debut role. Excellent blue ray transfer.
3,Body Heat - Blu-ray Info,"Version: U.S.A / Warner / Region A, B, CAspect ratio: 1.78:1VC-1 BD-25 / AACS / Advanced Profile 3Running time: 1:53:12Movie size: 17,97 GBDisc size: 20,09 GBTotal bit rate: 21.17 MbpsAverage video bit rate: 16.00 MbpsDolby TrueHD Audio English 1211 kbps 5.1 / 48 kHz / 1211 kbps / 16-bit (AC3 Core: 5.1 / 48 kHz / 640 kbps)Dolby Digital Audio English 640 kbps 5.1 / 48 kHz / 640 kbpsDolby Digital Audio Spanish 192 kbps 2.0 / 48 kHz / 192 kbps / Dolby SurroundDolby Digital Audio French 192 kbps 1.0 / 48 kHz / 192 kbpsDolby Digital Audio German 192 kbps 1.0 / 48 kHz / 192 kbpsDolby Digital Audio Japanese 192 kbps 1.0 / 48 kHz / 192 kbpsSubtitles: English SDH / Spanish / French / Japanese / GermanNumber of chapters: 30Deleted Scenes (SD - 9m:29s)Featurettes--1981 Interviews with Kathleen Turner and William Hurt (SD - 12m:36s)--The Plan (SD - 17m:6s)--The Post-Production (SD - 10m:37s)--The Production (SD - 16m:16s)#Theatrical Trailer (SD - 1m:34s)"
4,I disagree with the DvD picture quality Rating,"I received this DvD as a gift for Xmas. I've watched this film over and over, and it is a great value. I was surprised to see the picture quality for the DVD rated a 3 out of 5. Perhaps compared to ""The Matrix"" the picture quality is a 3, but that is a faulty comparison. This was filmed in a shadowy style and they were trying to do film noir in color. I compare this Dvd picture quality to that of the Vhs version of Body Heat, which is blurry and undefined. If you love this film, buy it and don't worry about the rating of a 3 out of 5. You'll like the picture quality, and if you haven't seen this film in awhile you'll love it, believe me!"
4,Most importantly it has Master of Rampling Gate - Anne Rice,"I probably got this as a ... remainder when I worked at ... around 1995, or maybe it was regular price, not important. This is a collection of short vampire stories by different authors. I don't know where else Anne Rice's first short story ""The Master of Rampling Gate"" is published other than the oop graphic novel I was lucky to find a long time ago. This is a must have for the vampire fanatic who's just getting into vampires and wants some tastes from classic to modern. Honestly I have only read the Anne Rice story. Other things in the book include Dracula's Guest (Bram Stoker), Close Behind Him (John Windam), and a bunch more by authors I don't really know any other stories by.Mine is published in 1993 which is probably the original publication, ISBN 1555219004."
3,Different and Decent,"I bought this album looking for more of the distinct Mae sound. However, what I found was another cliche album. At least with ""Destination:Beautiful"" the riffs and melodies added an innocence to the simple lyrics. On ""Everglow"" it seems like the band tried too hard to make a concept album and come off intellectual. The singers voice also seems to dropped down a few octaves on this album. Therefore, the combination of the content of the lyrics and the delivery found on ""Destination:Beautiful"" are not at all paralleled on ""Everglow."" This album attempts to be more mature than the youthful appeal of ""Destination:Beautiful."" This is for sure a Autumn CD whereas, ""Destination..."" is perfect for the summer.My decision to be so harsh on the album stems from their choice to make it a concept album. All artists know that this is a tough task to tackle. If you are looking for an amazing concept album check out ""The Ugly Organ"" by Cursive."
4,A journey,"The Everglow by Mae is an experience, to say the least. You really jsut have to try it for yourself. But- if you like soulful, deep, meaningful music- you'll love it. Mae is for lovers .... of music."
4,"mae, woo!","To be honest, at first, I was disappointed with the album. A few good songs here and there was all I cared for. I actually jammed this morning on my stereo system ((via iPod of course ;) )), and it gave more life to the album. What I'm trying to say is this album isn't as intense in vocals as Destination: Beautiful & Destination: B-Sides. Unfortunately it wasn't what I anticipated, but it's a great album still. Maybe if I take more of it in, I'll care for it more ;) I hope you all enjoy ;) And, c'mon guys, constructive criticism!"
3,Not For Everyone.,"Quite honestly, I thought Mae tried too hard with this release. It has its bright moments. In some places the piano is brilliant, but at times, it sounds like, for lack of a better description, he's just singing something he would have been better off speaking. Yes. I realize that's what music is, but there's a fine line between writing a song and picking up your latest journal entry and reading it ""as-is"" off the page. Lyrics should have rhythm, purpose and movement, not be crammed into a single melody without thought. I love Mae. I adored Destination: Beautiful. I picked up The Everglow without listening to it because I was hoping for the same thing that D:B was. I haven't gotten that satisfaction yet. Maybe it'll grow on me. However, for now, it's a 3 out of 5 for me."
3,Keepin it true to the roots,"I like Christian Rappers who keep the gift true to the era of Run D MC, Whoodini,and the like. When the gift was about lyrical expression, not about how many bags of drugs you can sell, and how many girls you can have sex with. He also speaks out against the FLOW of mainstream rappers they are all soo commercialized and Negitive! With nice beats and some smooth flows Sup can take you to that higher plane with no threat from negitive lyrics. Lets thank God for that!"
1,This Guy Cannot Be Seriuos,"Mr. Theile's book is a joke. And I am stupid enough to order one.With no original research, a lousy index, a ludicrous bibliography (cos' he just recycles secondary sources), poor understanding of German, this book is certainly one of the year's biggest scams on the unsuspecting reading public.The writing style is chaotic, the understanding of German idiotic, the level of research is absymal, this is just about the worst book on the Waffen SS I have ever read.For serious readres, I recommend the books ""The Waffen SS"" by George Stein and ""12.SS Panzerdivision Hitlerjugend"" by Hubert Meyer.Is anybody interested in my copy of Mr. Theile's book? I am willing to exchange it for anything on the Waffen SS that I don't have."
5,There is no singer like Nat Cole,"Even in the year 2002 there is no one who sings like Nat, his voice is christmas.This album is excellent as is all of his work."
5,A must have for christmas,"This arrived quickly and was well played during the time before as in the holydays of christmas..Used, but was as new!Nat gave us a warm feeling of christmas. Loved it!"
5,Christmas with Nat,This is one of the best Christmas Album I have ever had. Nat King Cole was one of my favorite singer since I was 6 years old. The song that I like most in this album is none other than The Christmas Song. Words just cannot describe how good it is. It just creep under my skin everytime I played it.
1,Didn't do anything,"I think I must have gotten the new formula, as it didn't do anything beneficial to my skin. I bought it because of the great reviews, but after reading the most recent reviews, the description of the new formula matches what I have in the bottle."
1,Good and Bad,I won't repeat stuff about the content that many others have said before.My recommendation is to buy Trust and Betrayal seperately and skip Reflections completely.Trust and Betrayal (the first two OVAs) are a must-have for every fan of the Manga or the TV series.Reflection is a jumble of flashbacks and a barely comprehensible story to hold it all together. I wish I had never seen it!
5,Samurai X OVA,"unlike the cartoony style done in the tv series, Samurai X offers a serious look in the character of Kenshin Himurs, and shows great character development from his time as a Hitokiri to his enlightment and the endo of the story. You will never get board with this intense story and will watch it hundered times over."
2,"Sorry kenshin fans, but this is a very overrated anime","Nice: (+ 2 stars)1- Amazing Japanese voice acting2- Nice animation in the first episode of the first ova3- Its nice to see how kenshin got the scarDidnt like: (- 3 stars)1- Excessive and unnecessary violence2- Bland animation after the fist episode of the first ova3- Boring and short fights (only the final fight in the first episode of the first ova is good)4- Too much drama, and one dimension characters5- Predecible story line6- Repetitive music score7- Chessy real life scenes mixed with the animation (the beach water for example)Trust me, dont waste your money in this ova, save your money for anything else ;)"
5,kenshin ova box set,"This kenshin, the one from the ova, is depressingly real. unlike the tv series, which was cheerful and exciting, the ova is dark, dreary, and full of emotion and meaning. It gives you a different impression of kenshin and it makes the tv series mean so much more. the action is much more bloody and viscious as well. probably something parents don't want to buy their little kenshin fans. but all in all, it's an incrediable ova that adds a lot of meaning to the kenshin series and makes kenshin much more real."
3,"Sadly, audio mastering spoils this wonderful anime","Samurai X (or Rurouni Kenshin) OVAs are among the best anime ever produced. The story, the art, the characters, everything just blew my mind away when I saw them for the first time, and still does. But, alas, something went awry, probably in the mastering phase of this release:For some unknown reason there are very annoying problems in the audio, which heavily affect the watching experience. Every now and then, when there is music, speech and sound effects playing simultaneously, music drops about 10-20 db, and the sound effects control the whole soundscape. Then, after a few seconds, the music strengthens again as suddenly as it weakened.Especially in this kind of story, where music plays a really big part in the atmosphere, these kinds of problems can't be forgiven. For me, it destroed the whole watching experience, which means that I'm forced to watch old digitized vhs-versions.Shame on the guys who mastered this."
4,Seed of Chucky,I though the movie was very good. It was overall entertaining and a good way if you want to just take out five bucks and see a movie. It was also a very funny movie. It had its up and DOWNS ((dont get me wrong)) but it still had me rolling down the iles. I think its a very good DVD to buy and I myself will definatley be purchasing this one !!
2,what were they thinking,"this movie suxed. I have watched all chucky movies and love the little guy but this installment was rediculous. Sure it had funny moments, and cameos that made no sense, but the whole plot of the child of chucky was odd. How the young gender confused doll was raised in England and what happend to the detective he attacked on ""the bride of Chuky"" at the end of the movie is not answered. Then Jenifer Tilly theactress acting as herself,gets chosen o be the serrogate mother for chucky's child.I was mostly confused on the birth of the twins that had no doll characteristics whatsoever. In all i wonder what were they thinking in trying to squeeze one more Chucky Movie in,when the rest were so good. I would of rather not known what happend to the child and think of what if."
2,not really that good,"These chucky movies were okay not that good. Just a killer that got hes soul transported into a good guy doll, and looking for a way to get a body back, so he found one kid named andy and tried to get hes body but andy would'nt let that happen, so these were okay."
1,Just awful.....,"I am a big fan of chucky as he is one of my personal best horror icons.....but this movie really isnt good. the little jokes are not funny, its not scary, awful acting and line delivery, awful plot and the kid.....hes so annoying. He is like an emo doll thats always sad. dont get this movie. get childs play 2 instead."
5,almost perfect,"Ok, we all know dvd is quickly going he way of VHS and if you are like me you kick yourself every time you waste your money buying a ""has been"" format, however, until this one is transferred to BluRay we gotta buy the dvd because we just got to have all the Chucky movies..haha...WARNING THOUGH...DOES NOT COME WITH FIRST MOVIE."
3,Son of Chucky,"While not a horror, this movie does manage to be very funy. Brad Dourif does the voice of Chucky and Billy Boyd does the voice of his son, er daughter, well, no, you will find out. So we find out Chucky has a son and of course he wants his kid to be a great killer like him. But there is problems to resolve to make this a happy family.Don't go into this expecting a horror flick, just watch it if you are a fan of these movies and want something on the gory but funny side."
5,Chucky!!,A classic horror film that is still enjoyable to watch. Had to buy the first one seperately which kinda sucks so just be aware of that before purchasing.
2,Another Recopilation More And Nothing NEW!!! :-(,"This Recopilation is another for many Abba CDs come on Universal please released One Cd with NEW materila Just Like That, Just A Notion ETC OK this CD set the only great is MORE ABBA GOLD CD this CD is now Out of market great idea for Buy this combo pack I Like the Packet is great POLARWORKS recommiend this ithem for new ABBA FANS !!!"
4,Heater for garage,I use this heater as a space heater for my garage when I am exercising. Does the job. Can have it automatically shut off via built in timer or it shuts off when it reaches the set temperature. Also appreciate the oscillation feature.
1,I bought two of them and they both stopped working and had the same problem,So I bought two of these heaters because they look great and I thought they would be nice to save on power instead of using my central heating... BIG MISTAKE. They both magically stopped working within 6 months of using. They just don't turn on anymore! the light blinks but the units won't work. These people made it like this on purpose. I gaurantee it. They want you to keep having to buy it over and over... I will never buy any honeywell products again. PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS!
5,Syphon Filter 2,I think that this game was great. The new 2 player mode was very fun. The new guns are cool. Such as the new sniper rifles.
2,...,"I can't say I enjoyed this at all. Unles you're heavily into aesthetics and understand most of the avante-garde terms, you're not going to make any sense of this. The book was overly pretentious and I couldn't burden myself to finish it. It's not at all what you'd expect, and the synopsis is misleading.Get the book Guy Debord and the Situationist International instead. Guy Debord was part of the Lettrist International, which founded alot of the psycho-geographical ideas. I guarantee it'll be a more interesting read than this."
2,"You Won't Find ""Forever"" on this one","While I am a big fan of Common, I have to disagree with the majority on here. This CD sounds really ""rushed."" I think lyrically Common is repetitive. I have heard some of these same verses before. Not to mention that the music & beats from Kanye and whomever else he worked with only makes this CD more lethargic.""The People"" is the only thing that keeps the CD alive. Sorry Common, but this CD made no ""sense""."
4,must have,Common is a perfect example of smart and witty hip hop. We need more of this music for young ears to hear. My fvorite tracks are the people II and don't break my heart. As a matter of fact the whole CD is pretty nice. I recommend that everyone give it a try. Especailly if you feel like Nas and I that hip hop is dead. But people like common will keep it alive. Peace.
4,great gift!!,"i bouthg this for my mom and she loves it. it smells great!! its a soft, fragrant smell..."
3,Typical Sword and sorcery,"Obviously, Jordan was tapped to write a book here for commercial purposes. It's not that good, but it's not too bad either (see the stars). Good for fans of Conan, and of S&S."
2,Not for the casual fan,"I recently purchased this disk because I had enjoyed Tull in the 1970's and this disk included some of the classic music of that era, as well as material from later in the band's career that I was unfamiliar with. What you get here is a live version of Living in the Past (without vocals), an obscure version of Warchild (not as nice as the original US release), and a number of rather forgetable tracks that would only be for true collectors. The best cut is an inspired live version of Locomotive Breath. Runner up is The Whistler (from the Songs from the Wood album). The collection does include the 10-minute version of Budapest, which is not bad, but I can't stop feeling that this is a Dire Straits song instead of Jethro Tull.Overall, there are better collections out there. Original Masters is great for the price, and Living in the Past contains the best cuts from the band's early period."
2,Do not incest on that matter,"Heard fantastic disks of the piece but not this one So alarmingly boring , triple sec soundscape can t beat that Really don 't like in this manner rushed, insensitive, kinda like confused string tone and brass it never seems to launch or leave the ground -we lose sight of the magic the primal, raw,earthly fate-faced of this earliest of finnish mythology."
3,Hit Status of Individual Songs,"One reviewer indicated that the songs were not significant hits. For reference, here is the list of songs with their peak position (#) and debut year as singles on the Billboard 100 indicated where applicable.1. Add Some Music to Your Day #64 (1970)2. Susie Cincinnati3. This Whole World4. Long Promised Land #89 (1971)5. Disney Girls6. 'Til I Die7. Surf's Up8. Marcella9. Sail On, Sailor #49 (1975)10. The Trader11. California Saga #84 (1973)12. Rock and Roll Music #5 (1976)13. It's OK #29 (1976)14. Honkin' Down the Highway15. Peggy Sue #59 (1978)16. Good Timin' #40 (1979)17. Goin' On #83 (1980)18. Come Go With Me #18 (1981)19. Getcha Back #26 (1985)20. California Dreamin'#57 (1986)So, 12 of the 20 charted. During this period (1970 to 1986), The Beach Boys had 18 songs that charted, a total of 1 in the top 10, 3 in the top 20, 5 in the top 30, and 7 in the top 40."
2,Think space and sleep!!!,It starts you off with slow melody. Gently pulling the covers over your head. Then it moves into wrapping you with its sweetness until your are finally weightless and pushing you face off the ceiling. If you like Explsions In the Sky or Dirty Three you will enjoy this.
4,Wix quality at Amazon prices,"See the image of this filter being installed in 2006 Honda CR-V.I did it myself to reduce service costs when I go to the dealership for other scheduled maintenance.I think Wix makes very good filters, so I was glad to get one here at Amazon without having to go to the auto parts store."
1,Junk,Maybe I just got a bad one....but this darn thing broke with the FIRST piece of paper I put in it. I hope you get a better one than I did.
2,Voltage Regulation,"There is two settings you can use, 120vac and 127vac. When I set it on 120vac with 113.5vac coming out of the wall, I get 113.5vas out of the unit. When I set it to 127vac, I get 132vac out of the unit, thats a little high but seems to work ok for what I'm using it for (flicker lights). The flicker lights do not work very well 113.vac. The company wrote back and said that is normal operation. They also said it is not possible with this unit to make the output a set voltage. I'm not happy with the 120vac setting, but it works ok with the 127vac setting even though it's a little high. I'm going to keep it."
2,Defective Unit,When the unit tripped I was never able to reset the unit. I will never buys from this company again. They would not fix or exchange the unit for me.
1,this is a really bad disk,Words cannot describe how bad this disk is. I hesitate to write more giving somebody the illusion that this album is worth more the thirty seconds of your time. When I received this cd I played it immediately and to my dismay I could not even get through the entire thing. This is a waste of your time and money.
3,The story of the first Cold War,"Good stuff for the history buff. This is the story of a century of great adventurers from Victorian England and Tsarist Russia as they struggled for control of Central Asia. The back and forth between the two great Ninteenth Century powers is gripping as they use force and guile over what is now Iran, Iraq, Afganistan and the various other ""-stans"" that were former Soviet states.The history is told through the varios exploits of Russian and British men who travel through lands unknown and risk their lives for adventure and Mother Country.While most all of the stories are fascinating, it is hard to keep track of the years when the stories take place. The book is more like a series of great stories rather than a flowing narrative. It is also very Anglo-centric and would have been better to have been more balanced.This book is recommended for those particulary interested in this era but not to anyone else."
3,True life adventures of British Indiana Joneses,"This narrative including the stories of British and Russian explorers and intelligence officers reads like an Ian Fleming novel. True life James Bonds and Indiana Joneses battle with Sultans, bandits, Russian spies and each other in exotic Asian lands. History alive: gripping and fascinating."
1,boring~~~~~,This book is the most boring book i have ever read.Would not read it if not for the sake of hw assignment.
4,Miracles at Work,"""Miracles At Work: Building Your Business from the Soul Up"" is an inside job. The feel-good story about working with people instead of them working for you is a great message. Then there is the added bonus of reading about good things happening locally. It is easy to envision a farm in Enfield, windows in Hartford or boats in Mystic having seen them all. Miracles do happen and they work no matter what or where the job is. It all depends on how you look at work!"
1,Melted ceramic stove top,"If this tea pot runs dry of water for 5-10 minutes, on mi-high it will melt on a porcelin range and destroy it. My Hot Point range was a little over a year old with no extended warrenty. $750 big ones down the drain.Henry Boenning FL"
3,works but it 'aint pretty for long,"This kettle functions as advertized, however construction is a bit on the flimsy side (the steel used is not very thick) and the finish is easily marred. After about 3 months of moderate use, the finish becomes scratched and dull."
5,Riverside - One Of Poland's Best,"As one of Poland's best progressive rock exports Riverside has come up with another winner for their sophomore release ""Second Life Syndrome"". The band continues in the same direction as their first one with their Opeth, meets Pink Floyd, meets Porcupine Tree sound. The 9 tracks here are all very well done and the album all flows together nicely. Highlights include ""Volte-Face"", the title track ""Second Life Syndrome"", and ""Dance With The Shadow"". This is another great slice of melodic progressive rock with a hint of metal from one of Poland's best bands."
4,Good book for a quick read,This is a good book that's a quick read. The chapters that appear in this book are also in The Case for Christ. I did enjoy both books and found them to be quite interesting. Not only is the theological evidence strong it is supported by archeological and medical evidence. I think this is a good book for any one who is interested in Christ and doesn't know where to start.
1,A waste of money,This does absolutely nothing -and I did use it for 3 weeks- plus it has an unpleasant color and muddy feel.
3,Doesn't Whistle,I don't know if I am not using it right or something. Mine doesn't whistle at all. But it boils water pretty fast. The enamal finish is great tho.
4,Good Quality Images. Will Cost a lot more than you expect.,"The quality of the images are very good and the 2 MB products are very much the *sweet spot* for amateurs and will be suitable for everyone except proffessionals. Be warned though that you should prepare to spend quite a bit more than the cost of the camera. 2 sets of batteries and a recharger are a neccessity and maybe an AC adapter as well. Nikon should try to include a recharger, nothing kills the digital camera experience more than realizing that your camera lasts for about 30 minutes before you need to put in new batteries. Also the 8 MB card is useless. You can only take 1 (!) high quality uncompressed image. Factor in...for a 64 MB Compact Flash. Likewise I havent found any image editing software (also a negative with Nikon is you get no printed manual and the basic software is VERY basic) so you will need to purchase some editing software."
5,Who needs all those megapixels?,"Ok, so this camera will not be able to take photos that can be blown up to a poster size. However, I bought this camera fairly cheap (just under two-hundred dollahs) earlier this year and it is fantastic! It's sturdy, the glass is sharp and the photos look amazing. The color, the white balance and the contrast are just spot on. Just look at photos taken by this camera by this camera on flickr, and you'll see this thing takes some beautiful photos!! It's quick to focus, it's got great battery life and snaps photos really quick! You won't regret buying this camera."
4,reel smart is indeed real smart,I live in rural WV and have used this product for two gardening seasons...it has proved itself to be both REAL SMART and USEFUL. Even my wife 'who is no avid gardener' likes and appreciates it too...as i can now bring in clean vegetables. One negative reviewer implied the positive reviewers might be company employee's...i am not!
4,Bought late in the year ...,"I bought this in late fall/early winter so I haven't actually put it through its full paces. I will note that it IS bottom heavy with the hose wrapped on the reel, and the top base connects by sliding the four posts into it - so the weight of the hose reel does allow the top to come off. Not a big deal, but some care should be taken if planning to move this item. If you have never used one of these 'hydro reels' I DEFINATELY recommend them, though. It doesn't use much water to wrap the hose, and after you have worked long in the yard/garden it largely eliminates one of the more time-consuming cleanup duties."
4,Good value for your money,"Performs as expected, but instructions were not very helpful. Just a bunch of diagrams without too many words explaining why it is important to really look at the small grooves to the side of the legas... ended up assembling half of it incorrectly and was hard to disconnect the partts to put them together agaon. Ended up scratching the surface to disconnect incorreclty placed parts. Really like the hose retracting feature - really easy!"
4,great outdoor sink for any use,"We bought this outdoor sink for our motor home. Usually when we cook outside,is necessary to have a sink outside the motorhome to wash utensils, children hands without having to go inside our unit. This sink works great and the price is just right. If you like something practical and non complicated, this is a good buy."
1,A Difficult read,"Although the information is located,somewhere, in this edition it is difficult to cut through the use of ""Ye Kings English"" Reading this book is like reading an old kings james version of the Bible.(Not that the KJV is bad, just tasking to get through all the ""Thee's & Thou's) The information about Christmas is in the book, it just seems to take forever to get around the word usage. I also found the order in which the information is presented not easy to follow. In my opinion if you are looking for just ""history of Christmas"" Go some place else FAST, before you fall asleep reading this snoozer! If you so choose to purchase this edition take no-doz and good luck!"
2,sobre calidad del proyectos personal de View Master,"Buenas noches. Escribo para decir que realmente esperaba una mejor calidad de proyector. Sinceramente, tuve un view master de niño y por eso lo compre a mi hija, pero los detalles de calidad con muy pobres. Por ejemplo cuando se cambia para ver otra imagen dentro del mismo disco se ve el resorte dentro del equipo. Además que cuando le pega mucha luz la imagen se hace poco nitida.Espero no desalentar a los que pudiera querer comprar uno.Saludos y buenas noches. (Comentario va sin acentos)"
4,Pamela's gluten-free Chocolate Walnut Biscotti,This is worth trying. I enjoy this when I need chocolate or a desert and haven't had time to bake. It's yummy alone or dunked in coffee. It is more dense than traditional wheat Biscotti so it did take eating two or three before I fully enjoyed having this as a desert or treat option. I give this ready made sweet treat a thumbs up for the gluten intolerant.
5,It's wonderful!,All the woman in my life really like it including my wife. I've had woman I've never meet before ask me what fragrance I'm wearing! I only get that question when I'm wearing Silver Shadow.
1,Why is this book still for sale?,"This 28-page booklet cannot truthfully be called a book. The advice it gives is merely this: Write down what you want and tell no one. This booklet was intended for a very unsophisticated audience with ""Cold War Values"" and is not at all relevant to the world of the 21st Century. It talks about housewives who are late for Bridge and little Billy getting poor marks in school and the tragedy of those two things. It would be funny if it weren't meant to be serious.This booklet was written by some fundamentalist Xtian crackpot who was too ashamed to put his name on the book. And that's exactly how this little pamphlet reads: A big joke by a big idiot.Save your money, this book will do nothing for you."
1,New Age Garbage,"I ordered this book with the thought that it would give me some sort of tangible conditioning method that might prime my subconscious with the improvements I would like to make in my life, or at least some similar method that taps into a person's subconscious potential. What I got was a new age manual that instructs you to pray to yourself, or rather to the god that supposedly dwells within each of us. I would consider myself a progressive christian, and do my best to stay objective on matters of faith, yet this method undermines many core christian beliefs and certainly not worth giving up my convictions of faith for. In short, caution to all the faithful out there; if you have a belief system that doesn't put YOU at the center of the universe, this book is not for you."
1,Don't Waste Your Time,This should be Free. Before I blinked twice I was finished reading it. The contents is already known (I was thinking of using the singular word 'content' as opposed to the plural because there is not much in this book) to most everyone who already has self help books. No need to get this one.
4,Playmobil Tent Set,Very pleased with the item could not get it in England had to order from America it wa dispatched and arrived on time
3,Good Face Creme,"I like this face creme but I wouldn't count on it to help with the wrinkles. I think the words ""wrinkle treatment"" is a little misleading. Overall it's a good moisturizer for the face, elbows and feet. Would I buy it again? Maybe."
4,Interesting Subject,"Suspenseful, non-stop action, and interesting subject---mercy killing. Loved the book."
4,oil can for generator,"the item works fine, i'm also very pleased with it. the price was excellent, and fit and finish was very nice, thank you"
1,Typical Griffiths Drivel,"As usual, Griffiths replaces formalism and math with hand waving nonsense. While that may work to some extent in E&M, it fails miserably with a topic such as quantum mechanics. Also, as others have mentioned, Griffiths leaves a good chunk of the actual learning to exercises, which would be fine if there were answers in the back to select important problems or *gasp* a solutions manual, but Griffiths lacks both. Save yourself the grief and buy someone else's book. Griffiths, as usual, just doesn't cut it."
2,Need an Instructor,"This book is very well written and probably the best text book to start. The only problem is that the first few chapters are great, but it becomes suddenly hard after a few chapters and it doesn't provide much information and it isn't rigorous, plus there aren't answers to the problems so if you get stuck, you are stuck for good unless you have an instructor. If you have an instructor, however, it would be a great text book and a reference. If you are studying on your own, I think that the book written by Nouredine Zettili is the best."
